Sioux Falls Animal Control has been notified of 5
positive cases of tularemia disease in cats and
dogs living in one Sioux Falls neighborhood. In
one case, the animal died of the disease known as "rabbit fever."

The test results were from pets which lived in
the Cactus Heights Mobile Home Park on North Cleveland Avenue.

The disease is caused by bacteria that typically
is found in rodents, rabbits and hares. Signs
include anorexia, lethargy, dehydration, oral ulcers and weight loss.

Pet owners can protect their animals by using
tick repellant or checking pets for ticks.

[Tularemia results from infection by _Francisella
tularensis_ (formerly known as Pasteurella
tularensis), a gram-negative, non足motile
coccobacillus. 2 subspecies exist: _F. tularensis
tularensis_ (also known as Jellison type A) and
_F. tularensis holarctica_ (Jellison type B). _F.
tularensis tularensis_ is found in lagomorphs in
North America and is highly virulent for humans
and domestic rabbits; _F. tularensis holarctica_
is less virulent and occurs in beaver, muskrats
and voles in North America and in hares and small rodents in Eurasia.

F. tularensis can be transmitted by ingestion,
inhalation, arthropod足borne transfer or direct
contact through the skin and mucous membranes.
Organisms are found in the blood and tissues of
infected animals and can survive for long periods
on fomites including food and water. Aquatic
animals may develop tularemia after being
immersed in contaminated water. Carnivores
sometimes become infected after ingesting a
contaminated carcass. Vectors for _F. tularensis
tularensis_ include ticks (including _Dermacentor
andersoni_, _D. variabilis_ and _Amblyomma
americanum_) and biting flies (particularly
deerflies). _F. tularensis holarctica_ is also
transmitted by mosquitoes in Russia. Rarely, the
organism is spread by animal bites.

_F. tularensis_ can survive for long periods of
time in arthropod vectors and in the environment.
Individual flies may carry the organism for 2
weeks and ticks throughout their lifetimes.
Viable bacteria can also be found for weeks to
months in the carcasses and hides of infected
animals and in fomites including grain dust,
straw, water, soil and bedbugs. This organism is
highly resistant to freezing; live organisms have
been found after 3 years in rabbit meat stored at 足15 deg C [5 deg F].

However, this short article gives us no
indication of how the animals contacted the
disease or if there is any type of
epidemiological investigation being done. While
it may be likely to conclude it is arthropod
borne, then warnings to the community should be forthcoming.
