The moderator listed hepatitis A and C as causes of foodborne viral
illnesses. While hepatitis A can be foodborne, hepatitis C is not.
Hepatitis E is the other hepatitis virus that is enterically transmitted.
In addition, you left out what is probably the most significant group of
viruses associated with contaminated food: Norwalk virus and other related
human caliciviruses (also called SRSVs - small, round, structured viruses).

Oh, this is going to produce a virtual "flood" of mail on this subject, and
many of the concerns are justified, however it is important to remember
that tuna "maguro" in Japanese and "ahi" in Hawaiian is a pellagic (open
ocean) species and not subject to the parasites which infest fresh-water
species. However, anyone who eats raw fresh-water fish is playing "parasite
roulette". And of course, unless you're sure the fish has been prepared
carefully, there is no guarantee that your expensive dinner won't be
contaminated with harmful bacteria....they're free.

Although raw food may be the rage here now, there are many areas of the
world where raw meat or fish are traditional dishes, for example, it would
be hard to convince the Peruvians to give up their ceviche!

Ahi Tuna is a Sushi/Sashimi dish in local Japanese Sushi bars. I have been
eating this seered ahi tuna for 3-4 years at various times. I have seen it
served at a Ritz Carlton Hotel in Laguna Niguel for a Orange County Wine
Tasting Meeting. Mostly it is served as a gourmet food. I have not seen
it served as an indication of the freshness and safe handling
representation of a restaurant.
True, Anasikiasis and such is possible from raw fish, but what are the real
incidence of these parasitic diseases? There is a lot of raw or
undercooked meat and fish served in Japanese (and other) restaurants, but
primarily Sushi Bars, throughout the United States, They are very popular
here on the West Coast! Seems there are large numbers consuming such food.
But what percent are likely to be infected? Are there any real numbers
available?

I have always enjoyed "naem" (sausage made of fermented raw pork and all
the goodies) in Thailand since the 1960s. So far, I have not contracted
trichinosis nor taeniasis ('keeping my fingers crossed though). The
prevalence of zoonotic/parasitic contamination in food products such as
this may be low. The probability of acquiring human infections from these
food products is like lottery - except that being a jackpot winner is not
the desired end.

[Thanks to the many people who wrote in to correct my slip concerning viral
causes of foodborne illnesses. I did indeed mean to say Hepatitis E rather
than Hepatitis C. Other considerations are also mentioned below. One of
the great things about moderating ProMED-mail is that you are absolutely
sure a better informed individual(s) will correct any mistakes or miscues.
We depend on our subscribers to inform us of new, emerging disease events
and fortunately we can count on them to catch our inevitable
mistakes. In addition to the above contributors, thanks to "Benjamin,
Robert, Public Health, DACD" and C. Jon Hinkle, Communicable Disease

sure accurate information is disseminated from ProMED-mail.- Mod. pc
