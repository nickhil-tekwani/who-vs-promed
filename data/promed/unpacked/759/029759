The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is collaborating
with public health and agriculture officials in many states and the
U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Poultry Improvement
Plan (NPIP) to investigate 2 outbreaks linked to chicks and ducklings.


The 1st is an outbreak of human _Salmonella_ Altona infections, and
the 2nd is an outbreak of human _Salmonella_ Johannesburg infections.
Both of these are rare types of salmonellae, and ill persons in both
outbreaks have a similar geographic distribution.
Investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify cases of
illness that may be part of this outbreak. In PulseNet, the national
network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories
coordinated by the CDC, DNA is analyzed from bacteria obtained through
diagnostic testing of ill people.

_S._ Altona Outbreak Investigation
----------------------------------
As of 23 Aug 2011, a total of 65 individuals infected with the
outbreak strain of _S._ Altona have been reported from 20 states. The
number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Alabama
(1), Georgia (1), Indiana (1), Kentucky (5), Maryland (5), Michigan
(1), Minnesota (1), Mississippi (1), New Hampshire (1), New York (4),
North Carolina (8), Ohio (12), Pennsylvania (6), South Carolina (1),
Tennessee (3), Texas (1), Virginia (7), Vermont (1), Wisconsin (1),
and West Virginia (4).

Among the persons with reported dates available, illnesses began
between 25 Feb 2011 and 30 Jul 2011. Infected individuals range in age
from less than one year old to 92 years old, and 32 percent of ill
persons are 5 years of age or younger. 52 percent of patients are
female. Among the 57 patients with available information, 17 (30
percent) were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with
animals and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. 41 (76
percent) of 54 ill persons interviewed reported contact with live
poultry (chicks, chickens, ducklings, ducks, geese, and turkeys)
before becoming ill. Of ill persons who could recall the type of live
poultry with which they had contact, 39 identified chicks, ducklings,
or both, and 32 (89 percent) of 36 ill persons with available vendor
information reported purchasing chicks and ducklings from multiple
locations of a nationwide agriculture feed store, Feed Store Chain A.
Ill persons reported purchasing live poultry for either backyard
flocks to produce eggs or as pets.

In May and June 2011, laboratory testing yielded _S._ Altona bacteria
from multiple samples: 3 samples from a chick and its environment
collected from an ill person's household in Ohio, 3 samples collected
from chick and duckling displays at 2 locations of Feed Store Chain A
in North Carolina, and 3 samples from a chicken and 2 ducks collected
from an ill person's household in Vermont. Findings of multiple
traceback investigations of live chicks and ducklings from homes of
ill persons have identified a single mail-order hatchery in Ohio as
the source of these chicks and ducklings.

_S._ Johannesburg Outbreak Investigation
----------------------------------------
As of 23 Aug 2011, a total of 27 individuals infected with the
outbreak strain of _S._ Johannesburg have been reported from 15
states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as
follows: Alabama (1), Arkansas (1), Georgia (2), Indiana (1), Kansas
(1), Kentucky (2), Maine (1), New York (4), North Carolina (4), Ohio
(3), Pennsylvania (1), South Carolina (1), Tennessee (2), Vermont (2),
and West Virginia (1).

Among the persons with reported dates available, illnesses began
between 19 Mar 2011 and 28 Jun 2011. Infected individuals range in
age from less than one year old to 60 years old, and 74 percent of ill
persons are 5 years of age or younger. 59 percent of patients are
female. Among the 21 patients with available information, 8 (38
percent) were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with
animals and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. 17 (71
percent) of 24 ill persons interviewed reported contact with live
poultry before becoming ill. Of ill persons who could recall the type
of live poultry with which they had contact, 14 identified chicks,
ducklings, or both, and 10 (71 percent) of 14 ill persons with
available vendor information reported purchasing chicks and ducklings
from multiple locations of the same nationwide agriculture feed store
identified in the outbreak of _S._ Altona infections, Feed Store Chain
A.

Findings of multiple traceback investigations of live chicks and
ducklings from homes of ill persons have identified the same single
mail-order hatchery in Ohio identified in the outbreak of _S._ Altona
infections as the source of these chicks and ducklings.

[More cases of serotypes Altona and Johannesburg of _S. enterica_ are
described in conjunction with exposure to baby chicks and ducklings.
Human salmonellosis after such an exposure is not a rare finding
especially during Easter time in the spring. - Mod.LL]
