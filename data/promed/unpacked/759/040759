Health Officials Identify West Nile Virus For First Time In Mississippi
Mississippi public health & animal health officials today announced
the first identification of West Nile Virus in Mississippi.
--------------------------------------------------
A horse from western Lee County has been found infected with West
Nile (WN) virus by testing performed through the State Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory. Initial tests on a second horse from the same
area suggest WNV infection; confirmatory testing is pending.
In addition, numerous dead blue jays have been found in Tupelo. Blue
jays are among the most susceptible birds to WNV. Testing of a
number of these birds is in progress & will take at least several days.
Shelby County, Tennessee [across the northern border of Mississippi
this week reported WN virus confirmations in birds.
No human case of West Nile virus infection has been identified so far
in Mississippi.
To help further identify WN virus in Mississippi, the State Department
of Health asks the public to participate by reporting and submitting
dead crows and blue jays to the local health department for testing.
Other species should be reported, but those will not be collected for
testing. Instructions for submitting birds and more information on WN
virus can be obtained from the MSDH website at:

or by calling Health Info, 1-800-489-7670, during weekday work hours.
For questions about horses, readers may call Dr. Jim Watson, the State
Veterinarian, at 1-888-646-8731 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays.
