Report of bird flu in China
A Beijing newspaper Monday reported the discovery of a strain of bird flu
in China's Guangdong [province, but officials in the southern province
denied there were any cases of the virus that killed six people in Hong
Kong. The Beijing Youth Daily report did not say when the virus was
discovered or whether it was the same type responsible for the deaths and
12 other infections in Hong Kong. "The bird flu found in Guangdong was a
type of infectious respiratory disease with a low infection rate, but the
airborne virus could possibly be spread by migratory geese," said the
report, which gave no source for the alleged discovery.
Guangdong health officials, contacted by telephone, strongly denied that
there were any cases in the province, which is just north of Hong Kong and
had been the source of much of the territory's chicken. "The province has
not detected any cases of bird flu in either poultry or humans," said a
provincial health official who asked not to be identified. Meanwhile, a
livestock official in nearby Hainan told Reuters the island province had
Saturday imposed a ban on chicken imports from Guangdong as a precaution.
"We do not know if there have been any cases of the flu in Guangdong, but
we implemented the ban as a preventive measure because we fear that
province will divert chickens to Hainan as a result of Hong Kong's ban," he
said.
Hong Kong in late December imposed a ban on chicken imports from China and
slaughtered more than a million birds as fears of infection by the avian
flu mounted. The H5N1 virus, not known to affect humans until 1997, has
infected 12 people in addition to the six who died in Hong Kong. Before the
ban, China supplied 75,000 chickens each day to Hong Kong, which reverted
to Chinese sovereignty last July after more than 150 years of British
colonial rule.

Newspapers on China's southern-most island province of Hainan have reported
that a virulent virus is infecting chickens in Guangdong, but officials in
Beijing have denied that the problem is related to the H5N1 influenza virus
outbreak and continued to give assurances that China is H5N1 free.
Agricultural Ministry official, Li indicated that there are many candidate
avian viruses, and that the H5N1 influenza virus was included in the
investigation.
Officials in Hainan have temporarily banned imports of chickens from
Guangdong, a move that has apparently angered officials in Beijing and
Guangdong. In Beijing itself, news media report that chicken sellers are
experiencing a marked decrease in business as shoppers have been staying
away from chicken markets.
