Alternaria found within Merced County
-------------------------------------
Relatively rare in the northern San Joaquin Valley, I was in an
orchard today [26 Aug 2011] with alternaria leaf spot. Caused by the
pathogen _Alternaria alternata_, this disease usually appears by mid
summer and causes defoliation.

Significant problems with alternaria have been observed in the
southern San Joaquin Valley and northern Sacramento Valley. In some of
these orchards, resistance to strobilurin fungicides has occurred,
which indicates the need to properly rotate fungicides when spraying
to control this disease.

[Almond leaf spot has been reported to have caused serious damage to
the almond industry in California due to severe defoliation of trees
resulting in yield losses often exceeding 50 per cent. In 2001, 3
species in the _Alternaria alternata_ complex were reported to be
associated with the disease (_A. alternata_, _A. arborescens_, _A.
tenuissima_; see link below). Symptoms include expanding lesions on
leaf blades and margins, defoliation, loss of general tree vigour, and
yield losses for several seasons following a severe infection. Disease
development is favoured by high humidity and prolonged leaf wetness,
and these risk factors are increased by common orchard practices
designed to increase yields, such as high-density plantings and
sprinkler irrigation.

The fungi are spread with contaminated plant material (including crop
debris), by mechanical means (including insect and human activities),
wind, and rain. Disease management may include cultural practices to
improve air circulation and reduce humidity in the orchards and
phytosanitation but relies mainly on fungicide programmes.

Strobilurins are strongly antifungal agents produced by fungi. Being
derived from natural products, they are considered environmentally
safe and are used against most major fungal crop diseases. Therefore
pathogen resistance is of major concern to many primary industries
worldwide. Rotating or mixing chemical classes of fungicides, as
suggested above, is used to extend the useful life of the compounds.
Strobilurin resistant alternaria leaf spot strains in almond were
first noted in California several years ago and, as reported above,
appear to be spreading north.
