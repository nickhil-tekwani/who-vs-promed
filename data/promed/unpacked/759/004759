[1] Case update
- 7 Jun 2018. Epidemiological situation 6 Jun 2018, DRC Ministry of Health [in French, machine trans., edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=c72bad4675

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 6 Jun 2018:
- a total of 62 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 38 confirmed, 14 probable, and 10 suspected;
- 1 new case confirmed to Iboko. This is a known contact of a probable case who died on 20 May 2018;
- 5 new suspected cases, including 2 in Bikoro and 3 in Wangata;
- 4 samples were negative;
- no deaths reported today [total of 27 deaths; 13 of them among the confirmed cases].

Epidemiological analyzes have identified contacts living in nearby health areas in Bikoro and Iboko. These contacts are followed and advised to limit their movements during the entire follow-up period of 21 days.

Remarks
- Negative tests are systematically removed from the summary table.
- The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation.

News from the Ebola response
Vaccination
- Since the launch of the vaccination on [21 May 2018], 1826 people have been vaccinated, including 673 in Mbandaka, 398 in Bikoro, 725 in Iboko, and 30 in Ingende.

Partnership
- This Fri 8 Jun 2018, a team of Chinese experts will arrive in Kinshasa to assist the Congolese health authorities in the response to Ebola virus disease. Like other international experts who come to support the Congolese experts, they will participate in the various commissions set up to manage the response.
- It is also worth mentioning that under Congolese legislation, any use of experimental vaccines must be authorized by the Scientific Committee and the Ethics Committee. To date, only the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine has been authorized by these committees as part of the current Ebola outbreak.

[2] MSF: challenges on the ground
- 7 Jun 2018. Democratic Republic of Congo: Fighting Ebola on the ground, a race against time
[Médecins Sans Frontières, MSF, (Doctors without Borders) edited]
http://www.msf.org/en/article/democratic-republic-congo-fighting-ebola-ground-race-against-time

Paul Jawor, an MSF water and sanitation expert, has just returned from Equateur province in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Paul was working in and around the remote village of Iboko, where cases of Ebola have been confirmed. He explains the challenges MSF teams are facing on the frontline of the ongoing outbreak.

"We arrived in Mbandaka city by plane in the morning on 20 May 2018. Mbandaka is the main city of the province where the current Ebola outbreak has been declared. Some cases have been reported in the town and MSF has set up an Ebola treatment centre (ETC) in response. But our team's job was to go and start an intervention in and around Iboko, a very remote village about 120 kilometres [about 75 mi] south of Mbandaka, where a patient had just been confirmed as infected with the Ebola virus.

"There was no helicopter available for 2 days, so we hit the road an hour after landing, with 3 rented cars, full of all the provisions and materials we could find. With an outbreak like this, it's a race against time, as one Ebola patient with symptoms can infect several people every day. The best way to contain the disease is to put all measures in place as soon as possible. And so the race was on.

"It was a long journey and we arrived in Itipo, a village on the way to Iboko which has also been affected by the outbreak, at night after having suffered mechanical problems and having to repair numerous broken wooden bridges along the way. One of our vehicles even drove off the edge of a bridge and it took us what seemed like hours to put it back on track in the dark.

"After spending the night in tents on the terrace of a nunnery, we set off again for Iboko, a further 2-3 hours' drive away. The villagers welcomed us, but we could see they were very scared of the disease.

"Iboko is a village made up of mainly grass huts with a church in the middle. It has a functioning hospital that serves a large area and numerous surrounding villages. My colleagues met with the community and its leaders to explain what we were coming to do and to raise awareness about Ebola, its transmission mode, and the sanitary measures to take for prevention.

"On my side, I enrolled some local staff and we focused on one of the 1st priorities: building an isolation ward, along with its latrine, shower room, dressing and undressing rooms, as well as a waste management area. This was done in a deserted building with 5 rooms, near the health centre. It was ready in 24 hours and could already receive suspected Ebola patients, who would be tested for the virus and receive initial care.

"Any confirmed cases would be, for now, transferred to the Bikoro ETC [Ebola treatment center]. Over the following days we planned and started building a 13-bed ETC that could be extended to 26 beds if needed. This meant that Ebola-confirmed patients could be treated in Iboko itself. Building an ETC is quite complex; everything has to be built meticulously in order to avoid cross-contamination between patients -- both suspected and confirmed cases -- healthcare workers, their families, and the population living nearby.

"One of the main challenges we face in this outbreak is that, despite our awareness-raising efforts in the community, people with Ebola-like symptoms don't want to come and be tested. Some of them also live far away from the ETC and prefer to stay at home. But this can be dangerous for the people caring for them. Caregivers could easily be infected and become the next suspected case. We are taking the maximum number of precautions.

"One woman who had been confirmed as having Ebola died in a village called Bobale, 19 kilometres [about 12 mi] from Iboko, after she had chosen to stay at home. We were quickly notified and an MSF colleague and I, along with a member of the Red Cross went there to make sure the woman's body, very infectious at that moment, would be taken care of with all the necessary precautions, while trying to respect the local customs.

"Night was falling by the time we arrived in Bobale. I was to disinfect the woman's house and put her in a safe body bag that would go into a sealed coffin which the community had made. But as it was dark, there wasn't enough light to enter the house safely without the risk of tearing my protection suit on sharp objects. So we decided to postpone the operation until the next morning.

"It took me an hour, sweating in my protection suit, to spray the house and disinfect the woman's body in a respectful way, under the eyes of her husband who was also wearing some protection. Then I collected all the clothes, sheets, and other possibly contaminated materials into a bag that I sprayed with chlorine. That was in turn put into another bag, sprayed again, and put into another bag. It was then taken back to our ETC in Iboko and burnt. In order to avoid spreading the disease, we are taking the maximum number of precautions.

"I left DRC a few days ago and other MSF colleagues have since joined the fight against Ebola. The main challenge will be convincing people to seek care at the treatment centres, especially in remote areas like Iboko. We must spare no effort to ensure that communities know how to protect themselves from the spread of this disease."

[3] Anti-viral drug testing
- 7 Jun 2018. Experimental Ebola drugs cleared
[STAT: Morning Rounds, edited]
https://us11.campaign-archive.com/?u=f8609630ae206654824f897b6&id=cd402f140c

Will experimental Ebola therapies make a difference in the DRC?
The Democratic Republic of the Congo has cleared 5 experimental Ebola therapies for compassionate use and potentially for use in clinical trials in the ongoing outbreak. But given the decline in cases, "it is very likely that very few patients are eligible" to get any of the drugs, the ministry of health acknowledged. There are fewer than 10 confirmed Ebola patients remaining in treatment units at this point. And most are in Bikoro, where conditions may be too basic to use most of these therapies, several of which have to be delivered in an infusion.

[The good news is that it is heartening that there are so few cases in need of an antiviral drug. This indicates the outbreak truly may be winding down as a result of the rapid public health response on the part of the DR Congo and outside organizations, and the implementation of an efficacious vaccine. The fact that sound field trials cannot be conducted is unfortunate for the future use of these experimental drugs. - Mod.LK]

[4] Ebola preparedness editorial
- 8 Jun 2018. Still not ready for Ebola. Joint External Evaluations (JEEs)
http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1049.full
[Science journal, American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), edited]

ref: Frieden TR. Still not ready for Ebola. Science, 2018; 360(6393): 1049. doi 10.1126/science.aau3345
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ebola is back. The disease that killed more than 11 000 people in West Africa just a few years ago has returned, striking the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Last week [week of 28 May 2018], intervention with a new vaccine was initiated to help contain the outbreak, adding another tool to a response that is exponentially better than it was 4 years ago. But we are not out of the woods. No matter how long this Ebola outbreak continues, the world faces critical tests in its battle against deadly pathogens. Unlike 2014, when delayed recognition of Ebola led to undetected disease spread, the DRC promptly admitted it had an outbreak and called for assistance. The World Health Organization (WHO) did not try to minimize the problem. Rapid response units from within the DRC and around the world deployed immediately. And, fortunately, the DRC has well-trained epidemiologists as well as laboratory capacity to test for the virus.

The Ebola vaccine is a very important tool, but it is not a game-changer. Comprehensive detection and response is still necessary to stop this and other outbreaks. And an outbreak in a dense urban setting is far different from a rural outbreak. A single patient can infect dozens of others in taxis, buses, and crowded housing and healthcare facilities, making outbreak control more difficult. Nigeria contained Ebola in Lagos, but only with an extraordinary effort that relied on highly experienced polio eradication teams operating within a structured incident-management system.

Globally, we must address 3 issues to tackle Ebola and other deadly pathogens. One is community engagement. Lack of trust between responders and communities has resulted in patients fleeing isolation, as well as likely missed cases and contacts. Ebola emerged in a remote community; it is essential to understand community perspectives and structure and to gain trust and enlist the community's strengths to stop the disease.

Another issue is WHO's effectiveness. The African Regional Office of WHO now has many staff with the needed technical and operational excellence, and the Geneva-based emergency program is more effective than before. But WHO country offices in DRC and elsewhere are not nearly as effective as they need to be. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, coming up on his 1st anniversary as WHO Director General, has unveiled a potentially transformative general program of work. His leadership will be essential for these ambitious goals and inspiring rhetoric to overcome operational and managerial weaknesses at WHO headquarters in Geneva, as well as in some regional and many country offices.

Most important, the entire world needs to support countries, including DRC, that have undergone voluntary external assessments of preparedness, known as Joint External Evaluations (JEEs). The JEE is an objective, transparent, meaningful report card on a country's ability to find, stop, and prevent outbreaks. By the end of 2018, approximately 100 countries will have undergone the rigorous JEE process. Thousands of technical experts -- the vast majority coming from within these countries themselves -- and billions of dollars are urgently needed to close the thousands of life-threatening gaps identified, and resources that have been committed need to be rapidly and effectively deployed.

The United States, historically a leader on global health security, now risks falling behind in pandemic preparedness. The proposed federal budget would slash US global health security funding by 2/3 and require the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to leave the field open to microbes in dozens of countries. As the latest Ebola outbreak reminds us, if the CDC's funding is not protected, the agency will not be able to help protect us. Because an outbreak can spread from a remote area to any major city in the world in 36 hours or less, we are all at risk. And as long as some countries remain at risk, none of us is safe.

[A sobering editorial from Thomas Frieden, an American infectious disease and public health expert, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and acting administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry from 2009 to 2017, appointed by President Barack Obama. If the US, which has the capacity to establish and maintain infectious disease preparedness cannot accomplish this, what country in the word will be able to? There have been too many warnings from serious outbreaks for the world to ignore the threat of emerging pathogens. Each country with sufficient economic resources must build sustainable capacity to prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. - Mod.LK
