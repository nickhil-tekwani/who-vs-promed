[In response to ProMED-mail post on 29 Oct 2003 - see refs -- on
Bluetongue virus in Spain (Balearic Islands); and a request for
vector information from Professor Emeritus T. Yuill, University of
Wisconsin]
Bluetongue vectors in the Balearic Islands
------------------------------------------
The vectors of bluetongue virus are _Culicoides_ species, but
although there are over 1000 species, very few are proven vectors.
The actual species transmitting the virus will depend on the area,
but in the Balearic islands the most likely vector is _Culicoides
imicola_, a species previously incriminated as a major vector in
Spain, Portugal, and other countries including South Africa. After
the female adult midge blood-feeds on a viremic host, the virus will
be present in her salivary glands after about 6-8 days, but the time
depends on temperature.
Once infected, the midge is infected for life. Although the flight
range of the very small _Culicoides_ is usually under 1 km, they can
be dispersed as aerial plankton over much greater distances, and in
fact such dispersal can result in new outbreaks of bluetongue.
_Culicoides_ midges often have very diffuse larval habitats, such as
damp soil and moist decaying vegetable matter, but _C. imicola_ often
breeds in faeces of cattle and other ruminants. Vector control is
usually not easy, but includes housing ruminants in insect-proof
buildings, especially from dusk to dawn, the period of maximum biting
by _Culicoides_ species. Animals can be sprayed with insecticides
such as permethrin to deter vectors feeding on them, and similarly
suspected larval habitats can be sprayed. A novel approach is
zooprophylaxis, involving placing cattle, the favoured host for _C.
imicola_, near sheep to reduce numbers of vectors biting them.
Bluetongue virus can infect not only domestic ruminants, but also a
wide range of wild ruminants such as antelope and deer. However,
these wild animals are not usually regarded as reservoir hosts.
