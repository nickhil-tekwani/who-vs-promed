Some 9 cases of hantavirus [infections] have been reported this year [2014] in Panama. Officials of the Ministry of Health have seen the necessity of suspending the Tonosi agricultural fair since 7 of the cases were from this locality in Las Tablas, Los Santos province.

This information was confirmed by the Minister of Health, Javier Diaz, who announced that the fair scheduled for next week [13-16 Feb 2014] would be postponed to a later date.

Just this Thursday afternoon [6 Feb 2014] 2 cases were reported. Of the 9 cases of hantavirus [infection], one person died. Most of the cases have been registered in the Azuero region.

[This report does not indicate why the Ministry of Health officials thought that there was a high risk of hantavirus infections for people attending the fair, unless they believed that fair-related activities, such as sale of food materials, would attract the rodent hosts of the virus.

The number of cases of hantavirus infections in the Azuero Peninsula (Herrera, Los Santos, and Veraguas provinces) of Panama, has increased from 2 reported on 19 Jan 2014 in Herrera and Los Santos provinces (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140121.2220063), to 5 reported on 31 Jan 2014 (archive no 20140131.2245195) and now to the 9 mentioned above. The Azuero Peninsula is where the majority of the HPS (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) cases have been found.

Although the hantavirus involved in these cases is not specified, the one most likely responsible is Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20130204.1527935, of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing HPS, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
