At a mink farm in Deurne and a mink farm in Wilbertoord (municipality of Mill and Sint Hubert), infections with SARS-CoV-2 have been detected. Both companies have approximately 3000 parent animals [each].

The infections came to light from the early warning, the monitoring system in which animals are tested for the virus every week. The companies are [to be] cleared as soon as possible.

A total of 50 mink farms in the Netherlands have now been declared infected.

[The spread of SARS-CoV-2 on Netherland's mink farms in the 2 southern provinces North Brabant and Limburg continues, in spite of the tightening of control measures as described in ProMED post 20200902.7740793 (addressing the experts' publication "Jumping back and forth: anthropozoonotic and zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 on mink farms"). Out of Netherlands' 120 mink farms, 50 have already been found infected. The mechanism of the continued circulation of the virus in the Dutch mink farms is yet to be revealed.

The above advisory experts' report has led to a government decision not to allow the restart of infected mink farms after culling. According to an earlier decision, mink farming was to be banned in the Netherlands, starting in 2024. This decision has been recently revised: Mink farming in the Netherlands is to be discontinued in the spring of 2021.

So far, COVID-19 has been reported in minks (_Neovison vison_) from 4 countries: Netherlands, Spain, Denmark, and the USA. In view of the high susceptibility of this species to SARS-CoV-2 infection, active surveillance in mink farms deserves consideration everywhere.

Information on the COVID-19 situation in farmed minks is expected from China, one of the world's 2 leading mink producers (the other one is Denmark).

Interestingly, Chinese authors published, in January 2020, a study into infectivity patterns of viruses hosted in many vertebrates, leading them to conclude that "infectivity pattern analysis illustrates that bat and mink may be 2 candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov" (Ref. 1). While this conclusion might be argued, it should encourage China's scientific community to attend to the situation in the local farmed mink industry.

China's version of Wikipedia, "Baike" (which means "Encyclopedia") on Badiu, mentions in the entry for American Mink (_Neovison vison_) that it "may also hunt rabbits, squirrels, reptiles, bats, and snails" (https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%BE%8E%E6%B4%B2%E6%B0%B4%E9%BC%AC/18511024?fromtitle=%E6%B0%B4%E8%B2%82&fromid=1177822; thanks for this reference are due to Dan Silver). Subscribers are also referred to an observation from the USA (Ref. 2).
