[re: ProMED-mail Avian influenza, human (01): Nepal (KT), poultry susp, RFI 20190108.6245559]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following information was submitted by an EpiCore Surveillance Project member.

The suspected farm was visited by a team from the animal health sector at Dadapauwa-6, Ramkot of Nagarjun municipality (GPS coordinates: N 27.719571, E 85.254101). [The farmer reported that] in a population of 3000 broiler chickens, some birds started to show clinical signs of respiratory problems from 2 Jan 2019. From 3 Jan 2019 birds started to die and by 11 Jan 2019, a total of 744 birds had died. The owner of the farm immediately took a dead bird to a private veterinary clinic at Balaju where post-mortem examination of the dead bird was done. According to the recommendation of the private clinic, they started the treatment the evening of 3 Jan 2019. During the visit on 11 Jan 2019, the mortality had dropped from 164 birds/day to 25 birds/day. The appropriate samples from dead and live birds were taken by the Veterinary Hospital and Specialized Service Center (VHSSC), Lalitpur, on 10 Jan 2019 and dispatched to Animal Disease Investigation Laboratory, Tripureshwor for further testing.

The epidemiological data and information were recorded using the Disease Investigation format. In total, around 744 broiler birds (4 weeks old) had died within one week and the mortality had dropped to 15 birds/day after medication, as recommended by vets from the private clinic.

The farmer brought a flock of 3000 Cobb-500 day-old chicks from Daunne Hatchery on 10 Dec 2018. Looking at the records maintained and interview with the owner of the farm, birds had died since day 9 (18 Dec 2018). During the early days, only a few birds (7-16) died and the farmer ignored it without taking any measures but [the situation] became serious when mortality increased to 60 birds/day on 3 Jan 2019.

On postmortem examination of birds at a private veterinary clinic in Balaju, the disease was diagnosed as chronic respiratory disease (CRD) complicated with _E. coli_ infection. The owner started the treatment as per the recommendation of the veterinary clinic, but the mortality was even higher during the 1st 2 days; however, it started to drop from the 5th day onwards and 25 dead birds/day were reported during the EDIT [not clear what this abbreviation means. Some kind of "Disease Investigation Team"?] visit on 11 Jan 2019.

The EDIT noticed poor bio-security and managemental practices at the farm. Most of the birds were seen tightly gathered in certain points and only a few birds were roaming uniformly. The environmental temperature of the shed was considered very low, which could possibly explain the gathering of birds in certain areas to cope with the low temperature.

The mortality pattern and the location of the outbreak area are shown in the following figure.
[No figure was included in the EpiCore report.]

The dead birds were disposed of by burial method in a nearby farm.

Clinical signs observed were respiratory distress, coughing, sneezing, mouth breathing, and low feed intake

Lab findings at the animal disease investigation laboratory, Tripureshwor
----------------------------------------------------------------------
One pooled environmental swab sample and 6 tracheal swab samples have been tested in the laboratory. All were found positive for influenza A. These samples were further tested with PCR which detected low pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H9N2.

Further measures taken to prevent other outbreaks:
- leaning and disinfection of vehicles before and after shipment of each consignment;
- proper disposal of dead birds;
- services delivered in farms by service providers need to be kept properly;
- strict vigilance in the area and surveillance in live bird markets;
- surveillance activities are intensified in the area;
- continuation of raising awareness among field staff and surveillance teams in particular to remain on alert in all districts;
- continuation of engaging in risk communication with all relevant stakeholders at central and local levels, including animal health sector, public health sector, farmers, key poultry industry representatives, and general public.

[The update above clearly highlights the epidemiological, diagnostic, and response aspects of the farm outbreak related to the RFI, with avian influenza A/H9N2 identified as the responsible influenza strain. Any updates on the final diagnosis and whether the human cases are affected by the same subtype or by seasonal influenza would be most appropriate, since avian influenza A/H9N2 has been identified as a potential pandemic virus.

There are reports of direct poultry to human transmission for this virus subtype, which incidentally, is also the donor of multiple gene segments to the influenza A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 viruses that infected humans (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4083066/).

Seroprevalence studies have also documented moderate levels (3 percent seroprevalence) of A/H9 immunity among poultry-exposed populations and provide evidence of sporadic asymptomatic avian-to-human A/H9 infections (https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/docserver/fulltext/jgv/98/8/2011_vir000877.pdf).

Most human cases are exposed to the A/H9N2 virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness. Since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations, further human cases can be expected. However, no case clusters as a result of human to human transmission have been reported to date, which highlights the need for confirming the subtype in humans and their individual exposure to infected or dead poultry. Current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans (https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_13_12_2018_FINAL.pdf). - Mod.UBA

The highly detailed response of the EpiCore member is commendable indeed. A recent publication by Saito et al reported development of a new, one-step, real-time RT-PCR assay to detect 2 major Eurasian H9 lineages of avian influenza viruses capable of causing human infection. The sensitivity of this assay was determined using in vitro-transcribed RNA, and the detection limit was approximately 3 copies/reaction. The assay is reported to be highly sensitive and specific for H9 HA detection and can be useful both for diagnostic purposes in cases of suspected human infection with influenza H9N2 viruses and for the surveillance of both avian and human influenza viruses (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30599081). - Mod.AS
