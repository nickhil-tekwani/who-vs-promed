More than 200 persons in Sikrauli village of Kakori in the [Uttar Pradesh] state capital [Lucknow] have taken ill with a mystery fever. Health officials are camping in the village to manage and monitor the situation. Chief medical officer (CMO), Lucknow, Dr SNS Yadav, claimed no death has been reported so far.

The matter caught the attention of the health officials on Sunday evening [3 Nov 2013] after health officials received an SMS stating that more than 50 per cent of the 10 000 residents of Sikrauli village were in the grip of a mystery fever. The message sent alarm bells ringing and a health team rushed to the village to take stock of the situation.

The team comprising the CMO and additional CMO (vector borne diseases control) organised a camp in the village where 200 persons were listed as sick till Tuesday evening [5 Nov 2013]. CMO Dr Yadav claimed that the patients have been given medicines to control fever.

He suspects the fever is of viral origin, though a confirmed report would come only after laboratory tests. "We have sent the blood sample of some patients to lab to ascertain the cause of illness," he said.

Dr Yadav blamed poor civic condition in the village as a contributory factor to the disease situation. "The sewage and garbage disposal systems in the village are in a bad state owing to acute shortage of safai workers [those engaged in 'unclean' occupations such as sanitation work]. The onus of cleaning the village lies on just one man," he claimed.

[A reported more than half of the village -- 5000 people -- coming down simultaneously with a non-fatal febrile illness is remarkable and of significant concern. However, the above report gives little information upon which to speculate concerning the etiological agent that might be responsible. The fact that vector control specialists have been called in suggests that vector-borne diseases such as chikungunya and dengue viruses might be suspected. The mention of sewage and garbage disposal systems being in bad condition suggests that the health authorities may suspect enteroviral or bacterial diseases. Until laboratory tests are completed, the etiology of this outbreak will remain unknown. ProMED would appreciate receiving additional information concerning additional cases and the results of the laboratory tests as they become available.
