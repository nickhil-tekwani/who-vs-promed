The Zambian government has said test results from samples of some
dead wild birds in Livingstone, capital of Southern province, are
avian influenza negative, The Post newspaper reported Friday.
Christina Chisembele, epidemiologist with the Ministry of
Agriculture, was quoted as saying here Thursday that the test results
indicate that the birds did not die of bird flu. However, Chisembele
could not give more details and said the permanent secretary of the
ministry will issue a statement on the issue. Chisembele reiterated
the government appeal to people to remain calm.
More than 40 wild birds were found dead early this week in
Livingstone near the famous Victoria Falls shared by Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Four birds were found dead in Lusaka Thursday triggering off new fear
of possible bird flu outbreak in the southern African country.

[It is interesting that the laboratory will not give a definitive
diagnosis on the cause of death of the birds. It is of some comfort
to realize it is not H5N1 avian influenza. However, without a
definitive diagnosis, one wonders if this is preliminary and it might
change. There are also other diseases, such as Newcastle disease,
botulism, salmonellosis, or aspergillosis which have caused
significant number of deaths in wild bird populations. We look
forward to a more definitive diagnosis. - Mods.TG/PC]
