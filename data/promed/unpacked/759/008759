17 000 birds killed for fear of bird flu
----------------------------------------
The ministry of Agriculture on Friday [12 Nov 2010] ordered the killing of
17 000 ducks and geese over fears that the LPAI virus detected (H5N2) [see
comment] could mutate into the high pathogenic H5N1.

The infection was detected on a poultry farm in Parchim, in Germany's state
Mecklenburg-West Pommerania [N central Germany], during a routine check
visit. No signs of clinical disease were detected.

The last time avian influenza was reported in Germany was in 2006, on the
Island Ruegen [In the Baltic Sea. where -- in Feb-Mar 2006 -- a large
number of wild swans, ducks, geese, birds of prey, as well as some cats and
a stone marten were found to have H5N1 infection; see archived
20060214.0489 and 20060310.0761. - Mod.AS].

Low pathogenic AI viruses found in poultry stocks
-------------------------------------------------
Low pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5 has been detected on a farm
with free-range poultry flock in Parchim, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern
[Mecklenburg - West Pommerania].

This farm participates voluntarily in the national AI monitoring program.

During these investigations, the antibody for H5 was found in several blood
samples. To clarify these findings, the statutory swab samples were taken
from living animals and examined for virus particles and low pathogenic
influenza A virus subtype H5 was detected. This finding by the State Office
for Agriculture, Food Safety and Fisheries has been confirmed today [11 Nov
2010] by the National Reference Laboratory at the
Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, while ruling out highly pathogenic virus.

[A confirmation of the designation, by the laboratory, of the LPNAI
detected in Parchim as H5N2, would be appreciated. Previous LPNAI cases in
Germany were, reportedly, related to H5N3.
