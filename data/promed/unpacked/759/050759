Ghana has, as of [10 Dec 2021], recorded 46 Yellow Fever deaths, with 102 confirmed cases out of about 600 suspected cases recorded.

The latest death was recorded on Thursday [9 Dec 2021], aside from 3 more new cases.

The outbreak, first recorded in October 2021, is now in 4 regions: Savannah, Upper West, Bono, and Oti regions.

Dr. Dennis Laryea, Acting Head of Disease Surveillance at the Ghana Health Service (GHS), told the Ghana News Agency, in Accra, on Friday [10 Dec 2021] that although the YF infections were gradually reducing, the Service was still recording some suspected cases.

"The outbreak started in West and North Gonja, but we have not recorded any case from these 2 districts over a period. We are, however, recording a few cases from Central Gonja, Bole, and Sawla-Tuna-Kaba districts," he said.

Dr. Laryea said the GHS had done an elaborate vaccination campaign in the areas at risk and would by next week receive a donation of about 400 000 doses of YF vaccines from the World Health Organisation (WHO) to expand the YF vaccination drive.

He said the drive would target about 600 000 unvaccinated persons in districts of concern.

Dr. Franklin Aseidu-Bekoe, Director for Public Health at the GHS, urged all persons from the region who had a fever, general weakness, headache, nausea, and vomiting, to immediately report to the nearest health facility.

He encouraged individuals who had never been vaccinated against Yellow Fever to do so.

"Avoid mosquito bites by wearing clothing that covers all parts of the body and report to the nearest health facility if you have a fever and, especially when you have yellowish discolouration of your eyes," he advised.

Yellow Fever is a tropical virus disease affecting the liver and kidneys, causing fever and jaundice and often fatal. It is transmitted by mosquitoes.

A person with Yellow Fever may have fever and jaundice in the early stages and later bleed from any of the body openings like the nose and mouth.

One may contract Yellow Fever through the bite of the _Aedes_ mosquito, and prevention is mainly by taking the Yellow Fever vaccine or preventing the bite of a mosquito.

A Yellow Fever vaccine provides lifelong immunity to an individual.

[The number of yellow fever (YF) fatalities continues to increase and spread geographically in Ghana. On 17 Nov 2021 the number of YF deaths was 25 in 4 regions, on 26 Nov 2021 there were 39 fatal cases in 5 regions, on 30 Nov 2021 the total was 40 in 8 regions and now the above report indicates that there are 102 confirmed cases with 46 deaths, not 40 as previously reported. The health services are intensifying vaccination campaign efforts in the affected areas to halt the outbreak. The YF vaccination campaign, increased surveillance and public information, all now under way, are essential to control this outbreak.

A previous report indicated that in the affected areas only 60% of the residents are reported to have been vaccinated. One hopes that this percentage will reach at least 80% in the coming days and bring this outbreak to a halt. If there are abundant populations of YF virus vector mosquitoes present in an area where a large proportion of the population is unvaccinated, YF can quickly get out of hand. - Mod.TY
