Foot and Mouth disease outbreak threatens border areas of Tajikistan
---------------------------------------------------
Areas of northern Tajikistan are facing a threat of [an] outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], according to the Chief Veterinary
Administration of Tajikistan.
Mullojon Amirbekov, Head of the Tajikistan's Chief Veterinary
Administration, told Asia-Plus that the possibility of the disease
spreading to these areas from Afghanistan, where a complex epidemiological
situation had formed, cannot be ruled out. According to him, to counter the
danger of spread of the FMD, they have imposed strict restrictions on
export and import of livestock in the Darvoz District of the Gorno
Badakhshan (GBAO). Tajikistan has reduced, according to him, the travel of
[motor vehicles. - Mod.JW], which should be in particular, disinfected.
Specialists from the Chief Veterinary Administration have already launched
a campaign to vaccinate cattle in public and private sectors in some
districts bordering on Afghanistan: Darvoz, Moskovsky, Farkhor and
Shurobod. "We have enough vaccine because it is produced here, in Dushanbe,
at the Central Asian Foot-and-mouth Disease Institute", Mullojon Amirbekov
said.
It should be noted that restrictions have been also imposed upon
transportation of cattle inside the republic. Thus, a veterinary post will
be set up today in the Varzob District. This post will control driving
cattle into the Sughd Province in northern Tajikistan.
According to Amirbekov, no case of FMD has so far been reported in [the]
territory of Tajikistan. [But] according to Russian news agency Interfax,
200 head of cattle have been infected with FMD in the Darvoz District of
the Gorno Badakhshan.

[According to OIE's Handistatus data base, the last FMD outbreak (serotype
O) was recorded in Tajikistan in June 2000, affecting cattle and sheep in 2
locations, Ishkashim and Shoug'nan. - Mod.AS]
[As stated in the moderator comment accompanying the ProMED-mail posting
Foot & mouth disease - Afghanistan: suspected 20030429.1058, "This
outbreak [in Afghanistan] remains "suspected" until it has been confirmed
at a laboratory. Information on the FMD virus type(s) involved is of
immediate importance. Typing should facilitate the vaccine
decision. Afghanistan is a member of the OIE, but since 1996 no reports on
the epizootic situation, including the incidence of list-A animal diseases,
have been available. During 2001, 4 samples were received at the World
Reference Laboratory for FMD at Pirbright; FMD virus type Asia 1 was
identified." - Mod. JW]
