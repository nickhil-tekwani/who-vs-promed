2 cases of 'rabbit fever' reported
----------------------------------
A Coconino County adult and child were diagnosed with tularemia, also known as
rabbit fever, in May 2005 after coming into contact with a skinned rabbit.
The adult had skinned the rabbit and the child had contact with the tissues of
the rabbit during skinning and dressing. They have both since recovered from
the bacterial disease.
Tularemia, also called deer fly fever, is a bacterial disease that infects
rabbits and other mammals. It can be transmitted to humans by skinning and
cleaning, usually of rabbits, or via deer fly and tick bites. Symptoms include
a sore where exposed, swollen lymph nodes, fever, chills, headache, and nausea
and usually occur from 1 to 14 days after exposure.
Outdoor enthusiasts are advised to avoid swimming in or drinking untreated
water from ponds that infected wild animals could use.

[_Francisella tularensis_, the bacterium that causes tularemia, is considered
a category A bioterrorism agent. Cases associated with the skinning of
rabbits usually involve glandular (lymph node) or ulceroglandular (skin and
lymph node) infection. Large outbreaks, especially in eastern Europe or Asia,
can be associated with water exposure.
Pneumonic tularemia can cause a severe and fatal pneumonia when the organism
is spread by aerosol, as might occur in a biological attack. However,
pneumonic tularemia also occurs without the involvement of bioterrorism, as
demonstrated by posts below in New York City as well as outbreaks on Martha's
Vineyard, MA. Unlike pneumonic plague, pneumonic tularemia does not spread
from person to person. - Mod.LL]
