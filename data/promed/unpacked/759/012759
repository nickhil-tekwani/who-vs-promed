Ebola Situation Report -- 29 Jul 2015
---------------------------------------

Summary
-------

There were 7 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the week to 26 Jul 2015: 4 in Guinea and 3 in Sierra Leone. This is the lowest weekly total for over a year, and comes after 8 consecutive weeks during which case incidence had plateaued at between 20 and 30 cases per week. Although this decline in case incidence is welcome, it is too early to tell whether it will be sustained. There have been several high-risk events in both Guinea and Sierra Leone in the past 14 days, and past experience has shown that it can take a single high-risk case or missed contact to spark a new cluster of cases. In addition, there are over 2000 contacts still within their 21-day follow-up period in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, representing a substantial residual risk of further cases. Refinements to the response continue to yield improvements, with recent weeks seeing a higher proportion of cases arising from contacts and a lower proportion of cases identified post-mortem than at any time previously, but the continued occurrence of high-risk transmission events means that an increase in case incidence in the near term is a strong possibility.

In Guinea, cases were restricted to a small geographical area in Conakry (3 cases) and the nearby prefecture Coyah (1 case). The large prefecture of Forecariah, which has seen widespread transmission since the start of 2015, reported no cases for the 1st time since January 2015, although there are still over 700 contacts under follow-up in the prefecture. For the 1st time in the outbreak, all cases reported from Guinea were registered contacts. All 3 of the cases from Conakry were registered contacts associated with a chain of transmission that originated in the prefecture of Dubreka. The remaining case from Coyah was a registered contact associated with a chain of transmission that originated in Forecariah. For the 1st time since September 2014, no EVD-positive community deaths were reported from Guinea.

No new cases were reported from Liberia in the week to 26 Jul 2015. Of the 6 confirmed cases reported since 29 June 2015, 2 have died, and the remaining 4 have now all been discharged after treatment. There are currently 33 contacts under follow-up in Liberia, all of whom will have completed the 21-day follow-up period by 2 Aug 2015.

The 3 confirmed cases in Sierra Leone were reported from Freetown (2 cases) and Tonkolili (1 case). Both cases from Freetown were registered contacts who were residing in a voluntary quarantine facility at the time of symptom onset, and were rapidly isolated. The remaining case from Tonkolili, a district east of Freetown in the centre of the country, is assessed as posing a substantial risk of further transmission. The case travelled to Tonkolili from an area near the Magazine Wharf neighbourhood of Freetown on 16 Jul 2015, and died on 23 Jul 2015 in a community hospital, where he was confirmed EVD-positive after post-mortem testing. The case visited at least 2 health facilities between 19 and 21 Jul 2015, and over 500 contacts have been identified so far. Investigations are ongoing to establish the source of infection and identify and trace all contacts.

1 new health worker infection was reported from Conakry, Guinea, in the week to 26 Jul 2015. Guinea has reported health worker infections in 5 of the past 6 weeks. No health worker infections were reported from Sierra Leone, but several health workers are listed as contacts of the case in Tonkolili. There have been a total of 880 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 510 reported deaths.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
----------------------

There have been a total of 27 748 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1) up to 26 Jul 2015, with 11 279 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 4 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea and 3 in Sierra Leone in the week to 26 Jul 2015.

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), adults aged 15 to 44 are approximately 4 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and Liberia, and 3 times more likely to be affected in Sierra Leone.

1 new health worker infection was reported in the week to 26 Jul 2015, from Conakry in Guinea. Since the start of the outbreak a total of 880 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 510 reported deaths (table 5).

[According to the IOM (International Office for Migration), since 23 Jun 2015, it has been leading infection prevention and control (IPC) training efforts in Sierra Leone, and has mobilized personnel to respond to the outbreak in Magazine Wharf in what is being called the "Western Area Surge." 15 IOM trainers are now providing support, in partnership with the Ebola Response Consortium, a grouping of seven NGOs, to 8 peripheral health units in the area. A UN (United Nations) World Health Organization (WHO) Sierra Leone field team has subsequently joined the mission. Regular activities have been postponed....

...Out of 17 total wharfs in Western Area Urban, 16 have been identified under a social mobilization team security review as having a high to medium threat rating....
...Community ownership has proved to be a critical success factor in the Ebola response and IOM is placing an increased focus on deepening community engagement....IOM staffers are responsible for mentoring local health care workers on advanced health screening and IPC protocols to ensure patients who may be symptomatic are picked up immediately, while maintaining staff safety....
According to Dr. Teresa Zakaria, who is leading the IOM HQ team, "It is essential to properly articulate population flows on the border and ensure interventions are multi-sectoral, so that mobility becomes an integrated component of the Ebola emergency response. It is only natural that when you tell someone no, they will seek an alternative place to dock a boat or to enter a community. So it is equally important to be sensitive to local realities and tap into local knowledge....more]"

http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2964412/neoliberal_ebola_palm_oil_logging_land_grabs_ecological_havoc_and_disease.html
[Commoditizing the forest may have lowered the region's ecosystemic threshold to the point where no emergency intervention can drive the Ebola outbreak to burn out on its own. The virus will continue to circulate, with the potential to explode again.
The outbreak of Ebola in West Africa had everything to do with logging, deforestation and the disruption of traditional agro-forestry by large scale industrial agriculture, writes Rob Wallace. The only long-term solution to this terrible disease may lie in forest conservation, the restoration of agroecological farming systems, and the exclusion of agribusiness investment....Here, sudden switches in land use may explain Ebola's emergence. Deforestation and intensive agriculture strip out traditional agroforestry's stochastic friction that until this point had kept the virus from stringing together enough transmission.
Under certain conditions, the forest may act as its own epidemiological protection. We risk the next deadly pandemic when we destroy that capacity...more]

27 Jul 2015: New vaccines for malaria, HIV and Ebola can spread diseases say shocking stats

[Prof Venugopal Nair, of The Pirbright Institute in Surrey, said the new "imperfect" vaccines can promote more virulent infections that survive and spread the disease.
But Prof Peter Openshaw, of Imperial College London, said: "It's important not to interpret this as an argument against vaccination."
British investigator Prof Venugopal Nair, of The Pirbright Institute near Woking, Surrey, said: "Our research demonstrates that the use of leaky vaccines can promote the evolution of nastier 'hot' viral strains that put un-vaccinated individuals at greater risk."...
...Researchers found new types of vaccines can allow the recipient to experience mild symptoms and remain contagious, putting others at risk.
They pointed out that this sort of vaccine is used to control virulent strains of bird flu that could pose a potential threat to thousands of people...more

Read AF, Baigent SJ, Powers C et al. Imperfect Vaccination Can Enhance the Transmission of Highly Virulent Pathogens. PloS Biology Published: 27 Jul 2015

Abstract. Could some vaccines drive the evolution of more virulent pathogens? Conventional wisdom is that natural selection will remove highly lethal pathogens if host death greatly reduces transmission. Vaccines that keep hosts alive but still allow transmission could thus allow very virulent strains to circulate in a population. Here we show experimentally that immunization of chickens against Marek's disease virus enhances the fitness of more virulent strains, making it possible for hyperpathogenic strains to transmit. Immunity elicited by direct vaccination or by maternal vaccination prolongs host survival but does not prevent infection, viral replication or transmission, thus extending the infectious periods of strains otherwise too lethal to persist. Our data show that anti-disease vaccines that do not prevent transmission can create conditions that promote the emergence of pathogen strains that cause more severe disease in unvaccinated hosts.

Author Summary. There is a theoretical expectation that some types of vaccines could prompt the evolution of more virulent ("hotter") pathogens. This idea follows from the notion that natural selection removes pathogen strains that are so "hot" that they kill their hosts and, therefore, themselves. Vaccines that let the hosts survive but do not prevent the spread of the pathogen relax this selection, allowing the evolution of hotter pathogens to occur. This type of vaccine is often called a leaky vaccine. When vaccines prevent transmission, as is the case for nearly all vaccines used in humans, this type of evolution towards increased virulence is blocked. But when vaccines leak, allowing at least some pathogen transmission, they could create the ecological conditions that would allow hot strains to emerge and persist. This theory proved highly controversial when it was initially proposed over a decade ago, but here we report experiments with Marek's disease virus in poultry that show that modern commercial leaky vaccines can have precisely this effect: they allow the onward transmission of strains otherwise too lethal to persist. Thus, the use of leaky vaccines can facilitate the evolution of pathogen strains that put unvaccinated hosts at greater risk of severe disease. The future challenge is to identify whether there are other types of vaccines used in animals and humans that might also generate these evolutionary risks.]

http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2015/07/could-some-vaccines-make-diseases-more-deadly
Vaccines save millions of lives every year by teaching our immune systems how to combat certain viruses or bacteria. But a new study suggests that, paradoxically, they could sometimes teach pathogens to become more dangerous as well. The study is controversial. It was done in chickens, and some scientists say it has little relevance for human vaccination; they worry it will reinforce doubts about the merits or safety of vaccines. It shouldn't, says lead author Andrew Read, a biologist at Pennsylvania State University, University Park: The study provides no support whatsoever for the antivaccine movement. But it does suggest that some vaccines may have to be monitored more closely, he argues, or supported with extra measures to prevent unintended consequences. ...-more
