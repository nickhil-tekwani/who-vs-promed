2 hunters acquired tularemia in Griesheim near Darmstadt (Hessen,
Germany) in November 2005. While gutting hares, the 2 sustained cuts.
Later they fell ill with fever, headache, joint and muscle pains, and
swollen lymph nodes. The diagnosis of tularemia was established at
the Klinikum Darmstadt Medical Center and confirmed at the Institute
for Tropical Diseases of the University of Heidelberg. The affected
hunters are recovering as outpatients.
The hunted hares did not show any abnormalities, and no dead animals
or live animals with unusual behavior have been observed in the area.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, 3 cases of tularemia were
diagnosed in Germany during 2004. In 2005, 3 cases have been reported
(not including these cases).

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Gekeler for this posting. Darmstadt is
located in the state of Hessen, in east central Germany. It is 30
minutes by car south of Frankfurt. Infection with _Francisella
tularensis_ (tularemia), a Category A bioterrorism agent, is endemic
in Europe. Sporadic cases are generally related to exposure to feral
animals, especially rabbits and hares, while larger clusters are
often water-related. - Mod.LL]
