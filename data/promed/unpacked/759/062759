More than 80 whooping cough cases have been reported in Mississippi,
with most of them clustered in Neshoba, Leake, Lauderdale, Attala,
Newton, and Winston counties.
Interim state health officer Doctor Ed Thompson said he has asked the
CDC in Atlanta for help. Thompson said CDC epidemiologists have
plenty of expertise in containing such outbreaks. Health officials
are providing booster vaccines for pertussis, commonly known as whopping cough.
Thompson said the outbreak flared rather quickly, as reemerging
diseases often do. The focus now is on containing it. Doctor Bret
Boes of Riley Hospital in Meridian said children are immunized for
whooping cough before entering school.
The most obvious symptom of whooping cough is intense coughing
spells. Experts say there will normally be 4 to 5 coughs at a time,
followed by a deep breath [the whoop - Mod.LL]. Other symptoms are
runny nose, severe upper respiratory congestion and low grade fever.

[The diagnostic criteria used for the cases here are not stated. Just
as important, the ages of the cases are not stated to assess whether
the infections are in the un-immunized, due to failure of the vaccine
in older children, waning of immunity in young adults or a combination.
The most recent CDC statement regarding adult immunization (CDC:
Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule --- United States, October
2006--September 2007 MMWR 2006;55; Q1-Q4)
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5540-Immunizationa1.htm>
states this about the tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccine in adults:
"Adults with uncertain histories of a complete primary vaccination
series with diphtheria and tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines should
begin or complete a primary vaccination series. A primary series for
adults is 3 doses; administer the 1st 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart
and the 3rd dose 6-12 months after the 2nd.
Administer a booster dose to adults who have completed a primary
series and if the last vaccination was received greater 10 years
previously. Tdap or tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine may be used;
Tdap should replace a single dose of Td for adults aged less than 65
years who have not previously received a dose of Tdap (either in the
primary series, as a booster, or for wound management).
Only one of 2 Tdap products (Adacel [Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater,
Pennsylvania]) is licensed for use in adults. If the person is
pregnant and received the last Td vaccination greater than 10 years
previously, administer Td during the 2nd or 3rd trimester; if the
person received the last Td vaccination in less than 10 years,
administer Tdap during the immediate postpartum period. A one-time
administration of one dose of Tdap with an interval as short as 2
years from a previous Td vaccination is recommended for postpartum
women, close contacts of infants aged <12 months, and all health-care
workers with direct patient contact. In certain situations, Td can be
deferred during pregnancy and Tdap substituted in the immediate
postpartum period, or Tdap can be given instead of Td to a pregnant
woman after an informed discussion with the woman." - Mod.LL]
