Hostels in Sheffield hit by outbreak of hepatitis A
---------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of hepatitis A has hit at least 4 hostels in Sheffield, forcing
health chiefs to take urgent action. Norfolk Park's bail [hostel] facility
is one of a handful of hepatitis "clusters" that have pushed the number of
confirmed cases above 80 since the disease began spreading in the city.
It is thought that hepatitis A was brought into the facility by 2 new
residents before it infected about 4 more people already staying there. The
Probation Service has responded by insisting on inoculation for all new
residents after the 45 people living there and staff were immunized and the
building cleaned. They are also banning anyone who refuses treatment and
are not accepting new residents each week from Friday midday to Monday
morning because they have no access to medical facilities.
South Yorkshire's chief probation officer, Heather Harker, said: "We have
taken the steps suggested by health and environmental consultants and the
situation has passed. But we are still taking it seriously; that's why we
can't take anyone here after Friday lunchtime because of the risk to others."
Bail hostels in Rotherham and Doncaster have not been affected by the
outbreak, Mrs Harker said. Residents of at least 3 other hostels, including
the Salvation Army's city facility, and around half a dozen people from the
Park Hill area have been affected by the outbreak, health chiefs said. The
illness is often being passed by hand-to-mouth contact and is spread
through poor personal hygiene. Many cases in Sheffield are drug users.
Dr Rosie McNaught, consultant in communicable disease control at South
Yorkshire Health Prevention, said: "The outbreak does not show any signs of
slowing down. But when we are finding out about new clusters we are
treating them."
