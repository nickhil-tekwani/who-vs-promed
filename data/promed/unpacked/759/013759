UK man under quarantine with Lassa fever
----------------------------------------
The 66-year-old man is suffering from Lassa fever, an infection
[Lassa fever] which comes from the same family as the deadly Ebola
virus. [This statement is incorrect. These viruses are unrelated.
Lassa fever virus belongs the _Arenaviridae_ family of viruses, and
the various species of Ebola virus are classified in the family
_Filoviridae_. - Mod.CP] The patient is being treated at the Royal
Free Hospital, where doctors describe his situation as "stable." It
has been confirmed that the man had recently been travelling in Nigeria.

Lassa fever is endemic in parts of Africa, where it is spread in the
droppings of infected [multimammate] rats. Although 80 percent of
cases produce no symptoms, the remainder develop a severe
multi-system disease affecting several organs in the body, such as
the liver, spleen and kidneys. The onset of the disease is gradual.
The Health Protection Agency (HPA) are stressing that this is an
isolated case and there is no risk to the general public.

The patient in question returned to the UK on 6 Jan 2009 and was
admitted to the Homerton University Hospital 2 days later. Doctors
moved him to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, University College
Hospital on Thursday [?14 Jan 2009], where he was diagnosed as having
Lassa fever. Once that discovery was made he was quickly transported
to Royal Free Hospital where experts could provide the appropriate treatment.

Dr Dilys Morgan, from the HPA, said, "The infection is not easily
spread to others and then only by direct contact with bodily fluids.
The usual incubation period for Lassa fever is 7-10 days. We are
working closely with Homerton University Hospital and the Hospital
for Tropical Diseases, University College Hospital to identify any
members of staff who may have been involved in the care of this
patient, and who came into contact with their bodily fluids. These
people will be provided with information about Lassa fever and asked
to get in contact with us should they develop any symptoms. Patients
and visitors to the hospital are not at risk."
