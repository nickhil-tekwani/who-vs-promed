Three dogs have died after drinking water at West Yorkshire nature reserve. Toxic algae was found in a lake at St Aidan's Nature Reserve, near Allerton Bywater, with the deaths occurring since the start of May [2016], police said. The Environment Agency is investigating, with vets advising pet owners not to allow their dogs to enter the water.

Blue-green algae produce toxins that can be fatal for animals and cause sickness and muscle pain in humans.

A springer spaniel recently collapsed after swimming in the lake, but has since made a full recovery. The spaniel's owner said: "She was a bit wobbly, I thought she had just overexerted herself. Within no time at all she was laid down and she didn't want to move, it was extremely frightening. I wasn't aware of the dangers in the water at the time."

[The article does not tell us what type of remedial action the area is taking, aside from posting signs. There are a number of cyanobacteria or blue-green algae that can cause quite serious problems.

Dog owners should be advised to leave the dogs at home as the blue-green algae can kill canines, horses, cattle, and possibly others. Readers are advised to see the moderator's comments in ProMED-mail posting 20160202.3988561. - Mod.TG
