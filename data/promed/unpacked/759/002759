PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2009 (02)

[With the continuing decline in the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been
decided to broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail updates to
include other prion-related diseases. Data on vCJD cases and other
forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also when they
have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

The number of suspect cases of vCJD referred to the CJD surveillance
unit in Edinburgh, and the number of deaths of definite and probable
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD
(new var.) or vCJD], the form of the disease thought to be linked to
BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), remain unchanged since the
previous monthly report; that is, the number of definite or probable
vCJD cases (dead and alive) remains 167.

This situation is consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in
the UK is in decline. The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the
peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in
2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in
2007, only one in 2008, and none so far in 2009.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2009
------------------------------------------
As of Mon 2 Feb 2009 in the UK, so far this year [2009], there have
been 2 referrals and no cases of sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, or
variant CJD, or GSS.

During the period 1992 to 2008, there were 23 cases of vCJD, all now
deceased. They occurred between 1996 and 2007: One case in 1996, one
in 2000, one in 2001, 3 in 2002, none in 2003, 2 in 2004, 6 in 2005,
6 in 2006, 3 in 2007, and none so far in 2008. There were 12 male and
11 female patients.

Their ages at time of death ranged from 19 to 58 years (mean 39); 6
of the patients resided in the Ile-de-France [Paris area] and 17 in
the provinces. All the cases were met-met homozygotes for codon 129
of the prion protein gene. No special risk factors were evident,
which distinguished these patients from those with other forms of CJD
(sporadic, genetic, iatrogenic). However, one patient had visited the
UK at regular intervals.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
------------------------------------------
As of 30 Dec 2008 in France, during the course of 2008, there have
been 1438 referrals, 76 deaths from sporadic CJD, 3 deaths from
iatrogenic CJD, 8 from familial CJD, none from GSS, and none from vCJD.

As of 30 Jan 2009, 106 cases were referred with no CJD diagnoses recorded.

Genetic risk factors for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: a
genome-wide association study

Abstract
--------

Background
--------------
Human and animal prion diseases are under genetic control, but apart
from PRNP (the gene that encodes the prion protein), we understand
little about human susceptibility to bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) prions, the causal agent of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).

Methods
-------
We did a genome-wide association study of the risk of vCJD and tested
for replication of our findings in samples from many categories of
human prion disease (929 samples) and control samples from the UK and
Papua New Guinea (4254 samples), including controls in the UK who
were genotyped by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. We also
did follow-up analyses of the genetic control of the clinical
phenotype of prion disease and analyzed candidate gene expression in
a mouse cellular model of prion infection.

Findings
------
The PRNP locus was strongly associated with risk across several
markers and all categories of prion disease (best single SNP [single
nucleotide polymorphism] association in vCJD p=2.5 x 10(-17); best
haplotypic association in vCJD p=1 x 10(-24)). Although the main
contribution to disease risk was conferred by PRNP polymorphic codon
129, another nearby SNP conferred increased risk of vCJD. In addition
to PRNP, one technically validated SNP association upstream of RARB
(the gene that encodes retinoic acid receptor beta) had nominal
genome-wide significance (p=1.9 x 10(-7)). A similar association was
found in a small sample of patients with iatrogenic CJD (p=0.030) but
not in patients with sporadic CJD (sCJD) or kuru. In cultured cells,
retinoic acid regulates the expression of the prion protein. We found
an association with acquired prion disease, including vCJD (p=5.6 x
10(-5)), kuru incubation time (p=0.017), and resistance to kuru
(p=2.5 x 10(-4)), in a region upstream of STMN2 (the gene that
encodes SCG10). The risk genotype was not associated with sCJD but
conferred an earlier age of onset. Furthermore, expression of Stmn2
was reduced 30-fold post-infection in a mouse cellular model of prion disease.

Interpretation
------------
The polymorphic codon 129 of PRNP was the main genetic risk factor
for vCJD; however, additional candidate loci have been identified,
which justifies functional analyses of these biological pathways in
prion disease.

[Although millions of people in the UK are thought to have been
exposed to the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) prion, only 167
people have developed vCJD so far. Polymorphisms at codon 129 of the
gene encoding prion protein (PRNP) partially explain why some people
have been affected whereas others have not, but other factors that
might contribute to susceptibility or incubation time remain to be
identified. The above study using genome-wide association technology
has confirmed the association with codon 129 of PRNP and has also
identified novel candidate loci. The results may provide a basis for
further investigation into whether vCJD is likely to develop in
people who have been exposed to the BSE prion but are currently
unaffected. - Mod.CP]

[5] 3rd vCJD death in the Netherlands
Date: Mon 2 Feb 2009
Source: AFP/Expatica [edited]
<http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/local_news/Netherlands-reports-third-human-death-from-mad-cow-disease_49203.html>


The 3rd person in the Netherlands died of the human variant of mad
cow disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob (vCJD), at the beginning of January
2009. The 3rd person in 4 years has died from the human form of mad
cow disease in the Netherlands, the national health research agency
RIVM said on Monday [2 Feb 2009].

"The patient died at the beginning of January [2009]," it announced
in a press statement. "An investigation has confirmed that the
patient died of the variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease." The
incurable disease is contracted from eating beef infected with BSE
and is also known as mad cow disease, caused by a rogue protein that
proliferates in the brain and turns it spongy.

The RIVM did not say how, when or where the patient contracted the
disease but pointed out that the incubation period, from infection to
the display of symptoms, could last decades. Investigations were
ongoing into the "very rare chance" that the patient may have
infected other people. The statement stressed that Dutch beef was
safe, explaining that all slaughtered cows are tested for BSE since 2001.

The RIVM said 2 other people have died of the disease in the
Netherlands, one diagnosed in 2005 and the other in 2006. "About 200
people have died of the disease in the world, 167 of them in
Britain," said the statement.
