The [Regional Government of Andalusia] announced this Sunday [23 Aug 2020] that the mosquitoborne West Nile virus has been detected in 19 horses. The outbreaks have been detected in the Provinces of Sevilla, Huelva, and Cadiz.

Specifically 2 in Cadiz (one in Puerto Real and another in Jerez de la Frontera), 5 in Huelva (2 in Almonte, and one each in Moguer, San Bartolome and Gibraleon); and 12 in Sevilla (4 in Lebrija, 3 in Los Palacios, 3 in Dos Hermanas, 2 in Las Cabezas de San Juan).

The surveillance system, implemented by the Department of Animal Health of the Regional Ministry in 2010, serves as a health alert for a possible outbreak of the virus in humans.

[West Nile fever is a mosquitoborne viral disease that can affect birds, humans, and horses causing inapparent infection, mild febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis, or death. West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ in the family Flaviviridae. The arbovirus is maintained in nature by cycling through birds and mosquitoes; numerous avian and mosquito species support virus replication. For many avian species, WNV infection causes no overt signs while other birds, such as American crows and blue jays, often succumb to fatal systemic illness. Among mammals, clinical disease is primarily exhibited in horses and humans.

Infections are dependent on mosquito transmission and are seasonal in temperate climates, peaking in the early autumn in the northern hemisphere.

Clinical signs of WNV infection in horses arise from viral-induced encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. Affected horses frequently demonstrate mild to severe ataxia. Signs can range from slight incoordination to recumbency. Some horses exhibit weakness, muscle fasciculation, and cranial nerve deficits. Fever is not a consistently recognised feature of the disease in horses. The above and additional information, including detailed diagnostic techniques and vaccine requirements, are available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.01.24_WEST_NILE.pdf.

Spain has been reporting the OIE on clinical cases of West Nile fever in horses, in Andalusia, since 2010 (no cases reported to the OIE from Andalusia during 2005-2009). Exacerbations were recorded in 2010, 2013, and 2016, as follows:
- 2010: 35 outbreaks (44 cases, 3 deaths);
- 2011: 5 outbreaks;
- 2012: 4;
- 2013: 35 outbreaks (40 cases, 11 deaths);
- 2014: 7;
- 2015: 16;
- 2016: 62 outbreaks (70 cases, 5 deaths);
- 2017: 12;
- 2018: 4;
- 2019: 5 outbreaks.

Few cases have been reported throughout the said years, in Castile and Leon or in Extremadura. - Mod.AS
