Foreign sausage meat blamed for hepatitis surge
-----------------------------------------------
Foreign sausage meat, much of it from France and Germany, is the likely source of an epidemic of hepatitis E liver disease, say British government scientists. The viral disease made 869 Britons seriously ill in 2014. Of those, 721 acquired the infection from food eaten in the UK. The figure compares with 274 in 2010, according to Public Health England (PHE), whose researchers realised pig meat was involved after surveys showed that up to 10 percent of sausages carried the virus.

The source, however, remained a mystery.

Now PHE scientists have carried out a genetic analysis of the hepatitis E virus (HEV) found in patients and compared it with samples from pigs in Britain and overseas. Richard Tedder, Professor of Medical Virology at University College London, said the virus infecting British consumers was identical to a strain infecting pig farms across Europe, but different from those found in the UK.

[Of the 4 recognized genotypes of hepatitis E, types 3 and 4 are zoonotic pathogens. The following is in part derived from Pavio N, Meng X-J, Renou C: Zoonotic hepatitis E: animal reservoirs and emerging risks. Vet Res 2010; 41(6): 46. doi: 10.1051/vetres/2010018; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2865210/:

The particularity of HEV is that, among all known major hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D and E), HEV is the only one with certain genotypes (3 and 4) with animal reservoirs. Swine HEV was 1st isolated and genetically characterized from pigs in the USA in 1997, even though HEV antibodies and RNA were reportedly detected from pigs in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, but the identity of the virus infecting the Nepalese pigs was not determined in that study. More recently, an avian HEV was identified and characterized from chickens with Hepatitis-Splenomegaly (HS) syndrome in 2001 in the USA as well. Besides swine and chickens, recently strains of HEV have been genetically identified from deer, mongooses, rabbits, and rats.

Accumulating evidence indicates that hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease, and swine (and likely other animal species) are reservoirs. Swine and human strains of HEV are genetically closely related and, in some cases, indistinguishable, and direct transmissions through the consumption of contaminated food products such as pork have been reported in Japan. Thus, zoonotic transmission of hepatitis E raises an important public health concern over food safety and zoonotic risk. - Mod.LL
