[The OIE Technical Fact Sheet lists the following countries below - and we can now add Spain to the list - as being infected as of February, 2012. Please see http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Our_scientific_expertise/docs/pdf/A_Schmallenberg_virus.pdf

First phase: Schmallenberg virus was first detected in November 2011 in Germany from samples collected in summer/autumn 2011 from diseased (fever, reduced milk yield) dairy cattle. Similar clinical signs (including diarrhoea) were detected in dairy cows in the Netherlands where the presence of Schmallenberg virus was also confirmed in December 2011.

Second phase: In early December 2011, congenital malformations were reported in newborn lambs in the Netherlands, and Schmallenberg virus was detected in and isolated from the brain tissue. Up to February 2012, Belgium, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Luxembourg and Italy have reported stillbirths and congenital malformations with PCR positive results.
