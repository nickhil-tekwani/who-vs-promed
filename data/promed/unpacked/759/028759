Vietnam health authorities warn of dengue fever epidemic
-------------------------------------------------------
HANOI: Vietnam health authorities on Fri 25 May 2001 warned of an impending
epidemic of dengue hemorrhagic fever, as more than 5000 cases of dengue
fever, 16 of them fatal, have been reported since the beginning of the
year. Most of the victims of this mosquito-transmitted disease live in
provinces close to the Mekong River delta, including An Giang, Tieng Giang.
and Ben Tre in South Vietnam.
The Health Ministry fears that the 5327 recorded cases portend an epidemic
similar to one that killed 400 people in 1998. Hemorrhagic dengue is a
viral disease endemic to South East Asia, the Pacific islands, and Latin
America. Some 5 per cent of the cases prove fatal, health authorities say.

[The hemorrhagic form of dengue fever is most commonly, but not
exclusively, observed in children under 15 years of age. Dengue hemorrhagic
fever, in its classic form -- characterized by capillary leak -- appears to
have a unique immunopathological basis mediated by heterologous dengue
antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection of cells of the
mononuclear phagocyte lineage. Consequently the risk of contracting the
hemorrhagic form of dengue fever is higher in children experiencing a
second infection with a heterologous dengue virus. Dengue hemorrhagic fever
may also be associated with primary infection, however, which suggests that
virus strain virulence may be another determining factor. The prediction of
an impending outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in Vietnam suggests that the
medical authorities are aware that at least 2 of the 4 serotypes of dengue
virus have been present in Vietnam. - Mod.CP
