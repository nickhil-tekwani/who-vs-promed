State of Emergency Declared in Chelyabinsk Over Rabies Outbreak
-------------------------------------------
A state of emergency has been declared in the Chelyabinsk region due to an outbreak of rabies among animals, the regional administration said in a statement.

In a decree posted on the administration's website, Ivan Feklin, the deputy governor of the region and head of the emergency response team for coordinating preventative measures for rabies, is tasked with confirming a complex set of measures to stabilize the region's rabies outbreak for the duration of the emergency regime.

The regional budget has allocated 2.44 million rubles (USD 78 000) for the purpose. According to the regional administration of the Federal Veterinary and Phytosanitary Monitoring Service, the region has been hit by a complicated epizootic situation with rabies in animals, Interfax reported.

Currently, there have been 106 instances of rabies recorded in 93 towns and villages throughout 17 municipal districts and in 9 cities of the Chelyabinsk region, including 4 in the city of Chelyabinsk.

The regional branch of the veterinary watchdog has sent 30 samples of biological material for rabies testing since the beginning of the year. In 85 percent of cases, the tests have confirmed the presence of rabies.

Veterinary services in Chelyabinsk will be conducting a month-long campaign for rabies prevention until 7 Apr 2013. Residents will be able to have their pets examined for the virus, as well as inoculated against it.

[A somewhat blurred while alarming report: no animal species named, no time-frame given for the 106 animal cases (laboratory confirmed?) mentioned. And, this moderator is not aware of an applicable test for rabies virus in live (clinically normal?) pets.

The official publication of the local government, namely "Order No 53-rp of the Government of the Chelyabinsk region, dated 20 Mar 2013, 'On the introduction of state of emergency regarding animal rabies in the Chelyabinsk region'", signed by the 'Acting Chairman of the Government of the Chelyabinsk region SL Komyakov' (machine translated from http://tinyurl.com/bwl8ys2), does not add information on top of the above media report.

Firsthand information from professional sources on the said points, including statistical data on human exposures, will be useful.
