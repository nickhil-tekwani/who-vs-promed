Biting flies are carrying a virus that's killing deer in Southwest Michigan
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) will likely continue in localized
clusters until a frost kills off the midges that carry the virus from
one sick deer to another, said John Lerg, a wildlife biologist with
the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE) in
Plainwell.

Deer deaths with EHD as the confirmed cause have occurred in Cass, Van
Buren, Ottawa, and Berrien counties, Lerg said.

The virus, which is not believed to affect people, causes internal
bleeding and high fever. The sick animals go in search of water, Lerg
said, and when multiple dead deer are discovered in an area near a
river or other waterway, EHD is always a suspect, Lerg said.

To confirm EHD as the cause of death, though, DNRE staff must locate a
freshly dead animal and haul it to the state's laboratory at Michigan
State University in East Lansing for testing. Because deer usually die
far away from populated areas, it can sometimes be difficult to find a
carcass suitable for testing, Lerg said.

About a dozen deer have been reported from Van Buren County, where
confirmation of EHD was recently received.

The disease does not affect hunters eating the meat, though hunters
are always cautioned to cook venison properly, Lerg said. Michigan's
bow-hunting season for white-tailed deer begins Friday [1 Oct 2010].

Because the disease generally stays confined to small groups of
animals, it is not as worrisome as some diseases, Lerg said. "By the
time we get confirmation that the disease is in an area, the disease
may have run its course," he said. And, with autumn approaching, the
1st hard frost will end the spread of illness, he said.

Deer can also be infected with eastern equine encephalitis, a
mosquito-borne virus that has killed many Michigan horses this year
[2010], but so far no deer have been found ill with that disease, Lerg
said.

[The mode of transmission of EHD in nature is via a _Culicoides_ sp.
biting fly or midge. _Culicoides variipennis_ is the most commonly
incriminated vector in North America. A common observation in
outbreaks involving large numbers of deer is that they are single
epizootics, which do not usually recur. Die-offs involving small
numbers of deer occur almost annually, and the disease appears to be
enzootic in these areas. All documented outbreaks of EHD have occurred
during late summer and early fall (August-October, being somewhat
location dependant) and have ceased abruptly with the onset of frost.
