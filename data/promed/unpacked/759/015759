The West Bengal government has issued a blanket ban on importing seed potatoes, particularly from Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir, owing to presence of potato cyst nematode (_Globodera rostochiensis_ and _G. pallida_). The notification followed a warning from the Union Agriculture and Farmers Department prohibiting movement of seed potato from these states to all other states and union territories due to the above mentioned disease.

"West Bengal being a major potato producing state and a portion of seed potatoes being brought in from outside the state boundaries, this is a serious cause of concern", the notification said. It directed all seed inspectors to strictly adhere to the restriction. "Local civil and police administration will extend their cooperation in implementing the restriction, with special thrust on interstate check points across the state."

[Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_, with at least 5 races) and pale (_G. pallida_) potato cyst nematodes (PCNs) cause serious crop losses in potato. Other solanaceous crops (such as tomato) and weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. PCN symptoms on potato include stunting, yellowing and wilting of leaves, as well as a reduced root system. PCNs may lead to complete crop failure. Diseased plants first occur in isolated patches and these become larger with each new crop.

The nematodes can survive in soil for up to 20 years as cysts. Spread occurs via infected soil, water, wind or on plant material (such as seed potatoes). Once they have been established in an area, eradication is extremely difficult. Disease management requires an integrated approach including phytosanitation (exclusion), cultural measures (such as long crop rotation with non-host species), use of crop cultivars resistant to specific PCN races (pathotypes) and nematicides (for example as seed tuber pretreatment). Control measures may be combined to keep nematode levels below economic thresholds.
