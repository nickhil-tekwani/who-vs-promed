Health officials continue to report cases of the parasitic disease, leishmaniasis, in Kenya. During the week ending [8 Dec 2019], officials saw 34 additional cases.

This brings the leishmaniasis outbreak tally this year [2019] to 2822, including 34 deaths.

Most cases of leishmaniasis have been reported from Mandera, Marsabit, Wajir, and Garissa counties.

Leishmaniasis is not a single disease, but a group of syndromes due to a variety of species of this parasite. They affect different populations and are related to a characteristic vector, the sandfly.

The disease can range from asymptomatic infections to those causing significant illness and death. Disease can appear on a spectrum from a single skin ulcer to destructive lesions of the face to terminal organ disease.

The vector for this parasite is a phlebotomine sandfly. There are a few different species implicated depending on the part of the world. Sandflies are very small (about 1/3 the size of a mosquito) and make no noise when flying. Their bites can sometimes be painless; because of these reasons, many people have no idea they were bitten. Even one bite of a sandfly can transmit disease, so travelers on short trips can still get infected.

There are several species of _Leishmania_ that cause disease in humans. The most common are _L. donovani_ (kala-azar), _L. tropica_ (Baghdad boil), and _L. braziliensis_ (espundia, [affects mucous membranes]). After getting bitten by a sandfly, the disease may manifest itself from a week to many months later.

It starts out as a papule that enlarges to an ulcer. The ulcer can give the appearance of a volcano crater. Lesions may appear singly or multiple; many heal spontaneously within weeks to months to years.

Certain species (_L. braziliensis_) can disseminate to the mucosal areas of the face and mouth and cause very destructive and disfiguring disease (espundia [affects the mucous membranes]) that appears similar to leprosy.

Kala-azar, an Indian name given to systemic type of the disease due to the grayish appearance of the body, can result in enlarged spleen and liver, diarrhea, emaciation, weakness, and death.
