[Oriental Magpie Robins are a common bird in Hong Kong and have
previously yielded H5N1 virus in 2009, 2008 and 2006. A Large Billed
Crow also yielded H5N1 virus in 2009 in Hong Kong. H5N1 has also been
isolated from both of these wild bird species in Japan and other
sites in Asia, so the current isolation of virus from these birds is
far from unprecedented. It does serve to remind us that we have seen
dead poultry, wild birds and a person this season in Hong Kong and
therefore, Avian influenza still requires intensive surveillance as
is being done in this instance.
