Dozens of dead cattle were found abandoned on the banks of the Shatt El Beida near the Ouled Abbas area south of the municipality of Tella. There were among them calves and cows of different ages and their death seemed recent. This raises many questions about the health risks likely to be caused by these abandoned carcasses and draws attention to the phenomenon of disposing of dead animals near water points and
not far from the population, which includes cattle breeders in the residential area of Ouled Abbas, located between the municipalities of Tella and Barj Beida.

The inspection of the area revealed the presence of dozens of dead cows and skeletons discarded in the open air, some of which seemed to
have died some time ago, while others died more recently, in view of the smell they emanated and their swelling. The intervention of the
services concerned is urgent to find out the real causes of this phenomenon and to take the steps necessary to bury the dead cattle.

Foot & mouth disease [FMD] has caused [in 2014] the death of hundreds of cattle in the province of Setif, as in other provinces. The disease entered through Bourzame area in the municipality of Bir El Arch in Setif, known to be a breeding area for dairy cattle and feeder calves.

[The information in this article seems patchy and at best imprecise. It would be interesting to receive from an informed veterinary source
details about the origins of these dead animals, a description of lesions found on the most recently deceased and, more importantly, on
what grounds FMD is the putative cause of the observed deaths in the province of Setif.

A detailed map of the Algerian province of Setif can be found at: http://www.setif.com/Carte_wilaya.html. - Mod.AB

Setif was one of Algeria's provinces affected by FMD in Aug-Jul 2014. This virus is a potential cause of sudden death in young animals mainly due to cardiac involvement; mortality in adult cattle is less likely though not excluded. The investigations into the described event should aim at identification of the owners of the affected animals and deserve to include infectious and non-infectious agents, including toxins/poisons. Results will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
