NEISSERIA MENINGITIDIS SEROGROUP A IN ONTARIO
Epidemics of meningococcal meningitis caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_
serogroup A virtually disappeared from industrialized nations after World
War II. Since 1990, the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control (LCDC) in
Ottawa has confirmed five cases of _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A in Canada,
with no laboratory-confirmed cases in the past 3 years. In Ontario, _N.
meningitidis_ serogroup A has not been confirmed since 1990. In early
1997, we identified _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A isolated from a case of
meningitis in the greater Toronto area. A 30-year-old male returning to
Canada in January 1997 from the northern state of Punjab, India, became ill
with symptoms of a high fever and headache during the flight back to
Toronto. The patient was admitted to hospital where cultures of both blood
and cerebrospinal fluid were positive for _N. meningitidis_...
Discussion: Meningococcal disease is a serious public-health concern
worldwide. In Europe and North America, the annual incidence of
meningococcal disease is one to three per 100,000 population and epidemics
have virtually disappeared, except for limited outbreaks and clusters of
cases. In developing countries and specific areas such as the "meningitis
belt" of sub-Saharan African, epidemics of meningococcal disease occur
approximately every 8 to 10 years and can affect 1% of the population. The
annual incidence of disease is about 10 to 50 cases per 100,000 in these
hyper-epidemic areas, and can rise to more than 500 cases per 100,000
during epidemics. In the early 1980s, serogroup A:4:P1.9/clone III-1
caused epidemics in China and Nepal before spreading to the north of India
in 1985. In the summer of 1987, the same strain of _N. meningitidis_ was
carried by Muslim pilgrims from southern Asia to Mecca and Medina, Saudi
Arabia, resulting in 7,000 cases. The relatively small number of cases
associated with this epidemic that were detected in Europe and North
America were linked to pilgrims returning home. Continued spread of this
strain to Africa following the return of Muslim pilgrims to
"meningitis-belt" countries has continued into 1996. In Ontario, the
majority of cases of meningococcal disease are due to _N. meningitidis_
serogroups B, C, Y, and occasionally W135. We have described an isolated
case in Ontario of meningococcal disease associated with the same strain of
_N. meningitidis_ A:4P1.9/clone III-1 that has been linked to the major
outbreaks in Africa, China, Nepal, the Middle East, and North India.
Although only sporadic cases of _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A may occur in
Canada, laboratory staff dealing with such specimens should be aware of the
possible occurrence of _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A, particularly in
patients with a recent travel history to pandemic or epidemic regions.
