Abstract
--------
In this study, we investigate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in the cities of Wuhan, Shenzhen, and Shijiazhuang in China. From January to April 2020, 38 144 healthy blood donors in the 3 cities were tested for total antibody against SARS-CoV-2 followed by pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 neutralization tests, IgG, and IgM antibody testing. Finally, a total of 398 donors were confirmed positive. The age- and sex-standardized SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among 18-60 year-old adults (18-65 years old in Shenzhen) was 2.66% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.24%-3.07%) in Wuhan, 0.033% (CI: 0.0029%-0.267%) in Shenzhen, and 0.0028% (CI: 0.0001%-0.158%) in Shijiazhuang, respectively. Female sex and older age were identified to be independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among blood donors in Wuhan. As most of the population of China remained uninfected during the early wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, effective public health measures are still certainly required to block viral spread before a vaccine is widely available.

[Evaluating the prevalence of COVID-19 infection among healthy blood donors is important. WHO has currently provided updated recommendations about screening donors for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or immunoassays (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-BloodSupply-2021-1), stating that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via transfusion of blood and components has not been reported and is currently considered highly unlikely. WHO also recommends that individuals with confirmed COVID-19 or recent contact with a known infected person should be deferred temporarily from donating blood to reduce the risk of respiratory and contact-mediated contagion in blood collection facilities and as a precaution against potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through transfusion of blood or components. Blood services should take steps to avert potential shortages of blood and components.

It is also recommended that effective public awareness campaigns on the importance of maintaining an adequate national blood supply, the need for blood donors, and the safety of the donation process should be disseminated continuously, using different communication platforms to reach all segments of the population.

WHO recognizes that there is some evidence for favourable outcomes in patients who have received COVID-19 convalescent plasma, but it is not definitive. SARS-CoV-2 virus does not transmit through blood donations and is not a bloodborne disease but identification of seroprevalence among the blood donors can give an estimate of circulation of the virus among healthy individuals, providing actual disease burden and real case fatality rate in a population. - Mod.UBA]

[A] Online self-reported COVID-19 symptom checkers may delay treatment

The US and UK digital COVID-19 symptom checkers consistently suggest less healthcare contact than Singapore's and Japan's, which may cause more serious outcomes, according to a study released yesterday by BMJ Health & Care Informatics (https://informatics.bmj.com/content/28/1/e100187.info).

While all 4 checkers failed to appropriately triage neutropenic sepsis or sepsis in those with low white blood cell count, the US and UK checkers consistently suggested no or delayed medical care for severe COVID-19, bacterial pneumonia, and sepsis.

The researchers evaluated the 4 symptom checkers using 52 simulations involving common COVID-19 symptoms, age, symptom duration, and health conditions. Singapore's and Japan's checkers advised contacting healthcare providers for 88% and 77% of the cases, respectively, around double the rate of those from the United States (38%) and United Kingdom (44%). Singapore and Japan were chosen because of their low COVID case-fatality rate (less than 0.1% and 2.7%, respectively), in contrast with the US (5.6%) and UK (13.6%).

The Singapore COVID-19 symptom checker, which the researchers deem the best tool, acts more like an online risk calculator, automatically referring patients to medical care if they are older than 65, have any health condition, or have symptoms for longer than 4 days. If the patient has shortness of breath, it recommends visiting the emergency department.

In contrast, the UK symptom checker attempts to make rudimentary clinical assessments, according to the study. The researchers bring up a case example of a 72 year old with a 7-day fever and cough: while the person could have sepsis, bacterial pneumonia, or COVID-19 pneumonia, the symptom checker advises a stay at home with no health care follow up.

"If symptom checkers are being used to replace the assessment of patients by trained personnel and are programmed to try and prevent further health care contact, then, as our case simulation study highlights, there are real concerns about the potential risk of harm from such an unproven approach," the researchers write. "Our results support the recommendation that symptom checkers should be subjected to the same level of evidenced-based quality assurance as other diagnostic tests prior to implementation."

[This is not a new concept, similar online or mobile app options have been used in the past for influenza as well during periods of increased virus circulation or seasonal upsurges. However, ascertaining the appropriate quality checks and cautions for seeking health care through telemedicine or face to face consultation with healthcare providers should be ensured to avoid underestimating the severity of the health condition. - Mod.UBA]

Higher pollen concentrations correlate with COVID-19 cases

Higher pollen concentration is correlated with an increase in COVID-19 cases in early spring 2020, reports a study published yesterday [8 Mar 2021] in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [see reference below]. While the data indicate that high pollen concentrations could add an extra 10% to 30% to SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, the researchers reiterate that viral transmissions will not occur unless you are exposed to someone with COVID-19.

Previous studies have shown that pollen exposure can impair immunity against some seasonal respiratory viruses, and so the researchers tried to identify a relationship with SARS-CoV-2. From early- to mid-March through [8 Apr 2020], they looked at data from 130 regions in 31 countries across all inhabited continents, synthesizing pollen concentration (in density and taxa classifications) and weather conditions such as temperature and humidity with COVID-19 data, population data, and lockdown effects.

According to the study, the relationship could explain, on average, 44% of infection rate variability in 9 out of 14 countries that experienced lockdown. Lockdowns themselves appeared to halve the daily infection rates correlated with pollen. While the taxa of the pollen did not seem to have any effect, the researchers say that those with allergies, asthma, or chronic rhinosinusitis may be more likely to experience the "pollen effect" than the general population. Overall, a 4-day lag was observed between high-pollen-concentration days (240 pollen grains per cubic meter) and an exponential increase of COVID-19 cases.

Some countries did not have any significant correlation between pollen concentration and cases, although the researchers point out that 7 had low pollen concentrations during the study period.

"As there can be no preventive measures against airborne pollen exposure, we suggest wide dissemination of pollen-virus coexposure dire effect information to encourage high-risk individuals to wear particle filter masks during high springtime pollen concentrations," the researchers write.

[3] Variants
[A] UK
Date: Wed 10 Mar 2021
Source: Independent [edited]
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/covid-kent-variant-deadly-b1815126.html


The more infectious [variant of coronavirus identified in Kent] may be up to twice as deadly [as] previously circulating forms of COVID-19, a new study suggests. Epidemiologists from the universities of Exeter and Bristol found the B.1.1.7 variant, which took hold in south east England last year [2020] before spreading around the world, is between 30 per cent and 100 per cent more deadly.

Robert Challen, lead author of the study from the University of Exeter, concluded that the Kent variant does "raise the risk" of dying from the disease. "Coupled with its ability to spread rapidly, this makes B.1.1.7 a threat that should be taken seriously," he said. Analysing death rates among people infected with the new variant, researchers found it led to 227 deaths in a sample of 54 906 patients -- compared with 141 among the same number of closely matched patients who had the variant circulating earlier in the pandemic.

Research has already shown that the B.1.1.7 variant is more transmissible and is thought to have contributed towards the rapid increase in cases before new lockdown rules were introduced across the UK. According to the study, published in the British Medical Journal [see [B] below], the higher transmissibility of the Kent variant meant that more people who would previously have been considered low risk were admitted to hospital. "The variant of concern, in addition to being more transmissible, seems to be more lethal," the study said. "This development, borne out in epidemiological analyses, implies that the rate of patients with serious infection requiring hospital attention will increase."

Leon Danon, a senior author of the study from the University of Bristol, said: "We focused our analysis on cases that occurred between November 2020 and January 2021, when both the old variants and the new variant were present in the UK. This meant we were able to maximise the number of 'matches' and reduce the impact of other biases. Subsequent analyses have confirmed our results. SARS-CoV-2 appears able to mutate quickly, and there is a real concern that other variants will arise with resistance to rapidly rolled out vaccines. Monitoring for new variants as they arise, measuring their characteristics, and acting appropriately needs to be a key part of the public health response in the future."

Ellen Brooks-Pollock, from the University of Bristol, said: "It was fortunate the mutation happened in a part of the genome covered by routine testing. Future mutations could arise and spread unchecked."

In January [2021], a paper from the New And Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) said there was a "realistic possibility" that the variant was associated with an increased risk of death. However, scientists have also warned there was a lot of uncertainty around the data.

Mutations of the virus have raised concerns about whether vaccines would be effective against new strains, including the now-dominant Kent strain. But research suggests the Pfizer jab is just as effective against the Kent variant of coronavirus, while other data indicates the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab has a similar efficacy against it.

Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: "This new study underpins findings previously considered by Nervtag, that the B117 variant of concern does appear to have a higher mortality rate, compared with the previously-circulating variant. There is already good evidence that this variant is more transmissible. This will have contributed to the rises in cases and deaths over the last few months, but it is important to note that when the November [2020] lockdown ended, daily figures were then heading in the wrong direction anyway -- the variant exacerbated the increases in new daily cases and deaths, but did not cause them. This also illustrates the importance of keeping case numbers suppressed, and the futility of those who called for the virus to be able to spread relatively freely, such as supporters of the Great Barrington Declaration [a statement written by 3 public health experts from Harvard, Stanford, and Oxford, that encourages governments to lift lockdown restrictions on young and healthy people while focusing protection measures on the elderly].

"The more COVID-19 there is, the more chance there is of a new variant of concern emerging. This includes the possibilities of variants that can have an impact on the vaccine roll-out. Thus, the recent calls for the UK to open up faster than the plans in the roadmap would be a reckless gamble, and we simply must proceed with caution in the short-term to give ourselves the better prospects in the long-term."

[B] Risk of mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/1: matched cohort study
Date: Wed 10 Mar 2021

https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n579


ref: Challen R, Brooks-Pollock E, Read JM, et al. Risk of mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/1: matched cohort study. BMJ. 2021 Mar 9; 372: n579. doi: 10.1136/bmj.n579. PMID: 33687922; PMCID: PMC7941603
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Objective
To establish whether there is any change in mortality from infection with a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, designated a variant of concern (VOC-202012/1) in December 2020, compared with circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Design
Matched cohort study.

Setting
Community based (pillar 2) COVID-19 testing centres in the UK using the TaqPath assay (a proxy measure of VOC-202012/1 infection).

Participants
54 906 matched pairs of participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in pillar 2 between [1 Oct 2020 and 29 Jan 2021], followed-up until [12 Feb 2021]. Participants were matched on age, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation, lower tier local authority region, and sample date of positive specimens, and differed only by detectability of the spike protein gene using the TaqPath assay.

Main outcome measure
Death within 28 days of the 1st positive SARS-CoV-2 test result.

Results
The mortality hazard ratio associated with infection with VOC-202012/1 compared with infection with previously circulating variants was 1.64 (95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.04) in patients who tested positive for COVID-19 in the community. In this comparatively low risk group, this represents an increase in deaths from 2.5 to 4.1 per 1000 detected cases.

Conclusions
The probability that the risk of mortality is increased by infection with VOC-202012/01 is high. If this finding is generalisable to other populations, infection with VOC-202012/1 has the potential to cause substantial additional mortality compared with previously circulating variants. Healthcare capacity planning and national and international control policies are all impacted by this finding, with increased mortality lending weight to the argument that further coordinated and stringent measures are justified to reduce deaths from SARS-CoV-2.

---
Despite the differences between the combinations investigated, all studies reported a statistically significant increase in the risk of mortality associated with VOC-202012/1, suggesting a real effect, and most central estimates were within the range of 1.5 to 1.7.

Discussion
----------
Infections with the new variant VOC-202012/1 (as measured by S gene negativity) were associated with an increased risk of death (P<0.001) in people testing positive for COVID-19 in the community. The increased hazard ratio between 1.32 and 2.04, higher than for other variants, translates to a 32% to 104% increased risk of death, with the most probable hazard ratio estimate of 1.64, or a 64% increased risk of death. The absolute risk of death in this group of community identified participants, however, remains relatively low, increasing from 2.5 to 4.1 deaths per 1000 cases.

We controlled for several biases when using a matched cohort approach. In particular, mortality is affected by how many patients require intensive care in a hospital setting14; increasing numbers of patients in the study period [1 Oct 2020 to 12 Feb 2021], compounded by staff absenteeism as a result of COVID-19 infection or isolation because of contact with infected people, has placed intense strain on hospital services and a reduction in the staff to patient ratio. Staff absenteeism might have affected mortality and is a potential source of bias. We controlled for this by matching patients on administrative region and time of positive test result (within one day), which constrains pairs to receive care at the same place and time, and we suggest at a similar level of care. Although age related mortality is controlled for by matching on age (within five years), it is also controlled for by using the Cox proportional hazards model.

As this was a community based study, we do not have information on the S gene status of patients in hospitals. The community based testing (pillar 2) in this dataset covered a younger age group and hence represented less severe disease than patients detected through hospital based testing (pillar 1). Death remains a comparatively rare outcome in patients detected in the community compared with identified in-hospital deaths. Our study only includes about 8% of the total deaths that occurred during the study period. Of all coronavirus deaths, about 26% occurred in those who were identified in the community, and data on S gene status was only available for 30%. Whether the increase in mortality from community based testing is also observed in elderly patients or patients admitted to hospital remains to be seen.

We cannot exclude a selection bias. Community testing is largely self-selected or driven by contact tracing. A potential bias remains if a higher proportion of patients with S gene negative infections without symptoms were undetected than patients with S gene positive infections. In this event, patients infected with VOC-202012/1 might be at a more advanced stage of disease when identified and have a higher apparent mortality. This could be consistent with the lower N gene cycle threshold values observed in S gene negative participants. Our analysis, or any retrospective study based on patients with symptoms, would not be able to detect this; however, early survey data suggest that people with S gene negative infections are, if anything, more likely to present for testing. Dealing with this potential bias requires a study design capable of detecting asymptomatic infections in participants who are negative or positive for the S gene.

Some of the increased risk could be explained by comorbidities. Information was not available about comorbid conditions in the data we analysed, although this would be partly controlled for by matching on age, ethnicity, and index of multiple deprivation. Currently, there is no evidence of a mechanistic reason why people with certain comorbidities would be infected with one variant and not another. It is possible, however, that people with certain comorbidities are at a higher risk of infection with VOC-202012/1 and have a higher mortality rate. This would tend to reduce the hazard ratio attributable to VOC-202012/1 alone.

Our preliminary estimate of the hazard ratio was 1.91 (95% confidence interval 1.35 to 2.71), which is marginally higher than the estimate presented here with compatible uncertainty. This was based on 94 deaths in S gene negative patients and 49 deaths in S gene positive patients in 66 208 less strictly matched pairs, with a shorter study period, and limited follow-up. As the new variant outbreak has unfolded and more data have become available, we have been able to obtain more accurate central estimates by narrowing the tolerance for mismatches, extending the study period, and increasing the proportion of patients with complete follow-up. The design of this study is well suited to determining, in an unbiased manner, whether the risk of death has increased, although we studied a comparatively small number of patients. Other study designs, involving the use of unpaired samples, might be better able to quantify the absolute increase in risk, albeit with more potential for bias. Other recent studies produced similar estimates of the increased hazard ratio. Although these studies use the same community based testing data, they had different study and analysis designs. The preliminary results of these studies were compatible point estimates of the mortality hazard ratio (1.3 to 1.65), and the confidence intervals of these studies overlap with those described here. As with our work, these other estimates are being continuously re-evaluated as more data are acquired; and in subsequent updates some of these have been revised upwards.

Conclusions
-----------
The variant of concern, in addition to being more transmissible, seems to be more lethal. We expect this to be associated with changes in its phenotypic properties because of multiple genetic mutations, and we see no reason why this finding would be specific to the UK. This development, borne out in epidemiological analyses, implies that the rate of patients with serious infection requiring hospital attention will increase. At the time of writing [15 Feb 2021], the national lockdown appears to be effective at reducing the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK, but proliferation of the new variant has made it more difficult to control the COVID-19 outbreak. The resulting number of deaths will scale linearly with the proportion of people infected with the new variant. Other analyses have indicated that the new variant is also associated with increased transmissibility, which would lead to a potentially exponential increase in the resulting number of deaths. Clinicians at the front line should be aware that a higher mortality rate is likely even if quality of practice remains unchanged. This has broader implications for any vaccination allocation policy designed to reduce mortality in the late middle age groups, typical of the community identified patients in this dataset.

The question remains whether excess mortality due to VOC-202012/1 will be observed in other population groups, particularly elderly people, care home residents, and those with other comorbidities who generally present directly to hospital as an emergency. Hospital based studies require a mechanism to distinguish emerging variants from previously circulating variants, currently only done through genotyping. Owing to the effort involved, the proportion of genotyped samples representing patients admitted to hospital remains low, and we recommend that PCR tests that specifically target VOC-202012/1 mutations should be more widely used.

Moreover, the emergence of VOC-202012/1 and its mutations (including E484K), combined with other variants of concern, including those identified in Brazil and South Africa, highlights the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to rapidly evolve new phenotypic variants, with mutants that evade vaccines being a real possibility. Our study has helped to characterise the clinical presentation and outcome of one new variant, but given sufficient amounts of informative data, our findings can be generalisable to other variants. Assessment of the clinical outcomes of multiple circulating phenotypic variants, however, requires scalable technology that is capable of identifying substantial numbers of patients infected with emerging variants (such as, broad PCR assay panels targeting variant foci30) and robust collection of outcome data.

In this study, we controlled for the effect of time, geographical location, age, sex, ethnicity, and deprivation, but these are important factors to understand if future outcomes are to improve. Future work on the relative impact of these might allow for better targeting of resource allocation, vaccine distribution strategies, and relaxation of restrictions.

[Based on what is already known, the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/1, first detected in the south east of England in autumn 2020, is reportedly more transmissible than previously circulating variants. The emergence of this variant coincided with high hospital occupancy, with the expected increase in mortality. However, unbiased mortality estimates associated with this variant of concern were not available. The additional information from this study reveals that individuals infected with the variant of concern, identified at UK community test centres, (32-104%; central estimate 64%) were more likely to die than equivalent individuals infected with previously circulating variants. However, the absolute risk of death in this largely unvaccinated population remains low. Clinicians and public health officials should be aware that a higher mortality rate is likely even if practice remains unchanged. - Mod.UBA]
