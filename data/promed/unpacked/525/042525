Identification in the UK of the 1st oseltamivir-resistant influenza
A(H1N1) virus of the 2008/09 season
---------------------------
Since week 34/08, several sporadic, laboratory-confirmed influenza
infections have been detected in the United Kingdom (UK): isolates
have included influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1) and influenza B.

The 1st oseltamivir resistant
influenza A(H1N1) for the 2008/09 season has also
been identified in the UK through the HPA
sentinel GP virological surveillance scheme. The
virus contains the H274Y mutation but remains
sensitive to zanamivir and amantadine, and is
antigenically similar to the H1N1 reference
strain A/Brisbane/ 59/2007, which is included in
this season's influenza vaccine. Antiviral
susceptibility tests on A(H3) isolates showed
that they are sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir.

With laboratory-confirmed sporadic influenza
infections of various strains in circulation at
the start of this autumn season, it is important
to emphasise that people in the defined influenza
risk groups should take up the recommendation of
influenza vaccination. It is too early in the
season to predict the course of the 2008/09
influenza season, and whether it will be
dominated by the circulation of H1N1, H3N2, or
influenza B. The Agency will be closely
monitoring the characteristics of circulating
isolates in order to determine the overall
prevalence of drug resistant influenza A and B isolates.

Influenza virus detections across Europe have
been low so far in the 2008/09 influenza season
(13 to date) and the above-mentioned H1N1
oseltamivir-resistant influenza isolate is, to
the Agency's knowledge, the 1st detected in
Europe. Influenza A oseltamivir resistance 1st
emerged last season with a number of circulating
influenza A(H1N1) isolates with the H274Y
mutation, which confers resistance to
oseltamivir, but not to zanamivir. By the end of
the 2007/08 season, 26 out of 33 reporting
European countries reported H1N1 oseltamivir
resistance ranging from 4 percent in Spain to 67
percent in Norway, with 11 percent (38/347) in
the UK [1,2].

The epidemiological evidence from the 2007/08 season suggested no
reported increase in morbidity associated with these confirmed
oseltamivir-resistant cases.

Reports between the 2nd quarter 2008 and September 2008 from WHO
showed high prevalence of resistance in the southern hemisphere with
100 percent (129/129) of H1N1 strains oseltamivir resistant in South
Africa, and 96 percent (25/26) strains in Australia [2].
