The malaria outbreak on Saibai and Dauan has resulted in a travel ban
between the Torres Strait and Papua Guinea. The DFAT (Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade) said that the travel ban will help in not
damaging the flimsy health system. The travel ban was put into effect
on 28 Mar 2011.

A spokesperson from DFAT said that malaria is not an infectious
disease, but it is transmitted by mosquitoes. He said that a travel
ban will not be imposed for activities under the Torres Strait Treaty.
The Torres Strait Treaty is an agreement signed in December 1978,
between Australia and PNG, which describes the boundaries of the state
and how the sea area may be used.

Meanwhile, Queensland Health public health medical officer Steven
Donohue said that an outbreak cannot be declared yet. Dr Donohue said:
"The incubation period of the malaria parasite in the _Anopheles_
mosquito is 1-2 weeks and can be more than 2-3 weeks in a person."

Donohue said that the last malaria case on Saibai Island was detected
on 10 Apr 2011, and hence we will still keep an eye on other cases for
some weeks.

Health officials on Saibai revealed that some 7 cases have been found
there, and hence they are educating people about the symptoms and
prevention of the disease.

[It is still not clear whether this is _P. falciparum_ or _P. vivax_.
We presume it is _P. falciparum_.

The website of the Queensland Public Health Authority
(http://www.health.qld.gov.au/) contains no information on the
outbreak. The statement that "malaria is not an infectious disease" is
probably a misquote. Infectious diseases include infections
transmitted between humans by insects.
