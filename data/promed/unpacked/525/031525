https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/25/nearly-170m-under-10s-unvaccinated-against-measles-worldwide


Nearly 170 million children in the world under the age of 10 years, including half a million in the UK and 2.5 million in the US, are unprotected from measles in the face of growing outbreaks of the disease, UNICEF is warning.

More than 21 million children a year are not vaccinated against one of the most infectious organisms in existence, says the UN body. Between 2010 and 2017, an estimated 169 million children missed the 1st of the recommended 2-dose regimen.

"The ground for the global measles outbreaks we are witnessing today was laid years ago," said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF executive director. "The measles virus will always find unvaccinated children. If we are serious about averting the spread of this dangerous but preventable disease, we need to vaccinate every child, in rich and poor countries alike."

Simon Stevens, the chief executive of National Health Service (NHS) England, warned the situation was serious. "Getting yourself and your children vaccinated against killer diseases is essential to staying healthy, and vaccine rejection is a serious and growing public health timebomb," he said.

He called for Facebook and Twitter to take action against the posting of anti-vaccine propaganda and conspiracy theories. "With measles cases almost quadrupling in England in just one year, it is grossly irresponsible for anybody to spread scare stories about vaccines, and social media firms should have a zero-tolerance approach towards this dangerous content," he said.

Measles cases are up 300% in the first 3 months of this year [2019] compared with the same period last year [2018], says UNICEF, with 110 000 confirmed reports. The same number died of the disease in 2017. Measles cases have reached their highest level in Europe for 20 years and caused an emergency to be declared in New York City.

Between 1 and 3 people in every 1000 who catch measles will die, it is estimated, and there are serious complications in some who survive, such as blindness, encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling), and pneumonia.

The US tops the list of high-income countries with the most children not receiving the 1st dose of the vaccine between 2010 and 2017, at more than 2.5 million. It is followed by France and the UK, with more than 600 000 and 500 000 unvaccinated infants, respectively, during the same period.

In low- and middle-income countries, the situation is critical, says UNICEF. In 2017, for example, Nigeria had the highest number of children under the age of one year who missed out on the 1st dose, at nearly 4 million. It was followed by India (2.9 million), Pakistan and Indonesia (1.2 million each), and Ethiopia (1.1 million).

Many countries have not introduced the 2nd dose, which is given after the age of 4 years. Twenty countries in sub-Saharan Africa do not have it in their immunisation schedule, which means that 17 million infants are at higher risk.

Dr. Robin Nandy, UNICEF's chief of immunisation, said: "I'm extremely worried and everybody should be worried. I'd be very disappointed if we were not worried about it. We have had a vaccine for a number of decades now. It is inexpensive, efficacious, safe and widely available. Despite this we are seeing outbreaks all across the world.

"We know in many conflict-affected areas and remote rural areas and some urban slums there are kids being left out for whatever reason, but we are also seeing measles outbreaks in Europe, Japan and the United States and it is extremely disappointing. Measles vaccine is a silver bullet as far as public health is concerned."

Country-wide vaccination rates can be deceptive, said Nandy. There needs to be 95% coverage to prevent outbreaks, and some countries may manage 92%. But that means there will be pockets where vaccination rates are low. "There is a pool of susceptible kids concentrated in a particular location. As soon as the virus is introduced in that population, it spreads like wildfire and 90% of kids are going to get sick."

Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said: "Having your child fully immunised against measles and other childhood infections should be as automatic and straightforward as teaching them how to feed themselves and sending them to school. It should be a no-brainer.

"UNICEF is delivering a clear message to all of us in public service to get our act together. If we insist on playing the blame game, then we should be blaming ourselves, not parents and anti-vaxxers when things are not done right.

"It's what we are paid to do and we have a joint responsibility to deliver. If we fail we are letting down the next generation just as negligently as by filling the seas with plastic and the atmosphere with greenhouse gases."

Dr. Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, said: "These numbers highlight the importance of not only routine vaccination but also making sure anyone who missed a dose is caught up to minimise the risk of outbreaks. When you consider absolute numbers it highlights that even a tiny slip -- 1% or 2% different in vaccination uptake -- could make a big difference."

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/04/measles-la-county-2-pregnant-nyc-women-infected


In new developments in the nation's surge of measles cases, Los Angeles County health officials announced they are investigating an outbreak, and New York City authorities said an outbreak centered in the Orthodox Jewish community underway since last fall [2018] has reached 390 cases, including infections in 2 pregnant women.

Five LA county cases
----------------
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH) said in a news release that it has received a number of measles reports in residents, including a local outbreak of 4 confirmed cases linked to each other after international travel and a single case after international travel.

County officials said the 5 cases are the 1st measles cases confirmed among LA County residents and the 1st cases of transmission within the county in 2019. They added that the cases aren't related to 4 earlier cases in people who traveled through LA County earlier this year [2019] and that most of the patients were unvaccinated.

"We will likely see additional measles cases in Los Angeles County, so it is important if you or someone you know has the symptoms of measles or has been exposed to measles to contact your healthcare provider by phone right away before seeking treatment," said Muntu Davis, MD, MPH, LA County health officer.

NYC outbreak nears 400 cases
-----------------------
Meanwhile, an outbreak tied to the Orthodox Jewish community in the Williamsburg neighborhood has risen to 390 cases, and the total now included 2 pregnant women, one of whom was diagnosed in the middle of April [2019], according to a statement today [24 Apr 2019] from NYC Health.

In background information, the department said that, of the 390 cases, 94 have been reported in April [2019]. And 323 cases (83%) involve people within 4 zip codes in the Williamsburg neighborhood, an area under an emergency vaccination order since 12 Apr 2019. So far, 12 people have received summonses for not complying.

Regarding the infections in 2 pregnant women, Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot, MD, said in the statement, "These cases are stark reminders of why New Yorkers must get vaccinated against the measles as soon as possible. When we do not get vaccinated, we put our friends, our relatives, our neighbors, our classmates, and other fellow New Yorkers at risk."

Also today [24 Apr 2019], NYC Health issued another health alert to healthcare providers that updated guidance for adults who have not completed the 2-dose series of a measles-containing vaccine and updated guidance for children, such as an extra early vaccine dose for children ages 6 to 11 months old who live or regularly spend time in Williamsburg or other areas with measles activity.

Eight people who are part of the outbreak, including the index patient, were exposed to measles while traveling abroad to Israel (5), the UK (2), and Ukraine (1), a fact that NYC Health said highlights the need for measles vaccination in those traveling overseas.

New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show there are now 626 confirmed cases of the measles in 22 states across the country. The majority of the new reports are from New York.

Agency officials are predicting that, in the coming weeks, confirmed cases will likely surpass 2014 levels, which saw 667 cases. That was the most since the disease was eliminated in 2000.

So, what does that mean for Alaska? Veterinary epidemiologist Louisa Castrodale with the Division of Public Health, said if you've been vaccinated, there's no risk of getting it again.

No cases have been reported in Alaska this year [2019] or in 2018, but that doesn't mean you're out of the woods. A public health alert was issued in January [2019] for people to check their vaccination status. The concern was if you haven't had the measles and are exposed to it, you can get it.

[In 2014, one large outbreak, primarily among unvaccinated people in Amish communities in Ohio, accounted for more than half of the total that year. In 2018-2019, the outbreaks in New York City and New York State are among the largest and longest lasting since 2000. The outbreaks are linked to travelers who brought measles back from countries such as Israel, Ukraine and the Philippines, where large measles outbreaks are occurring.

Paul Offit, director of the vaccine education center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said 18 studies affirmed the safety of the MMR vaccine, including a decade-long study of more than 650 000 children in Denmark that compared children who received the MMR vaccine with those who did not. The study results released this year (2019) concluded there was no increased risk of autism in children who had the MMR vaccine and no evidence that it triggered autism in susceptible children. "I am not sure how many more studies need to be done," Offit said. "I can't believe we are still talking about this issue that from a scientific standpoint has been resolved."

[4] California (Los Angeles County): UCLA and Cal State LA quarantine declared
Date: Fri 26 Apr 2019 3:07 AM ET

https://tinyurl.com/y49xxgg4


Hundreds of students and faculty at 2 universities in Los Angeles (LA) have been asked to stay home unless they can prove that they've been vaccinated against measles. The LA campuses of the University of California and California State University imposed the quarantine after they became aware of people infected with measles who had potentially exposed hundreds. At UCLA, a student exposed at least 500 people earlier this month [April 2019]; at Cal State, someone with measles went to a library and encountered hundreds.

UCLA was notified by the LA County Department of Public Health that one of its students had contracted measles. After identifying people the infected student might have come in contact with while contagious, the school asked them to provide proof of immunization. On Wednesday [24 Apr 2019], 119 people who couldn't provide proof were quarantined.

Of those, dozens were able to prove immunity and were released from quarantine by Thursday [25 Apr 2019] afternoon. But 82 were still quarantined, and "a few may need to remain in quarantine for up to 7 days," the school said in a statement.

"Considering the time that has elapsed since the last possible exposure to the individual with measles on 9 Apr 2019, the highest risk period for developing measles has already passed -- and the period during which symptoms may appear is nearing the end," UCLA Chancellor Gene Block said.

At Cal State, 156 library employees, some of them students, were quarantined after they couldn't provide their immunization records, The Associated Press reported.

Los Angeles County declared Monday [22 Apr 2019] that the county was facing a measles outbreak, with international travel leading to 5 case of measles in California, state officials said, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is working closely with health officials at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and California State University Los Angeles (Cal State LA) to institute a series of actions to limit the spread of measles based on its assessment of the previously identified measles cases. The goals are to build awareness among students, faculty and staff about the risks of measles after a potential exposure to measles, to confirm immunity to measles for those exposed, to provide instructions on what to do if you think you were exposed, and to offer measles immunizations to the broader university community.

In this situation, for those exposed to a confirmed case of measles who could not provide evidence of 2 doses of measles immunizations or lab-verified immunity to measles, a Health Officer Order for quarantine is being issued. Generally, a Health Officer Order ("Order") mandates the exposed person to remain at their residence, to notify Public Health if they develop symptoms of measles, and to avoid contact with others until the end of their quarantine period or until they provide evidence of immunity. Quarantine for measles can be up to 21 days from the date of last exposure, at which time the exposed person is no longer a risk for developing the disease and spreading measles to others.

Both universities are assisting with the implementation of quarantine orders and determining how best to support students who must be quarantined and who live on campus.

Measles is highly contagious. It can stay in the air for up to 2 hours after a sick person coughs or sneezes and can also stay on surfaces for many hours. About 90% of people who are exposed and not immune to measles become ill 7 to 21 days after exposure.

Schools are considered high-risk settings for exposure due to potentially frequent and prolonged contact. In accordance with the 1 Feb 2016, California Department of Public Health Immunization and Screening recommendations for college students, UCLA and Cal State LA require 2 doses of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunization OR positive titer (laboratory evidence of immunity to disease) for incoming students. Two doses of measles immunization are about 97% effective. Thus, getting immunized is the best way to prevent getting and spreading measles. Immunization protects not only the person who receives the immunization but also reduces the chance that measles will spread to family members, coworkers and friends.

Public Health will continue to communicate with schools, healthcare providers, health plans, local governments, and elected officials to provide updates on the measles outbreak and actions they can take to help prevent the spread of measles and support the countywide response.

[Two people with measles recently visited the Los Angeles campuses of the University of California and California State University, forcing officials to request that 119 faculty and students who didn't have proof of immunization to remain at home.

The LA County Department of Public Health took action quickly to quell a potentially large outbreak of measles at UCLA and Cal State LA. If not already in place, universities need to start checking vaccination records of all entering students to prevent the need for such severe measures as a 21-day quarantine. Unfortunately, the measles problem is likely to increase unless vaccine hesitancy is reversed. - Mod.LK

[6] California (San Diego): isolation rooms

https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Rady-Childrens-Prepares-Isolation-Rooms-for-Future-Measles-Patients-508932681.html


Experts say it's only a matter of time before the highly contagious measles virus shows up in San Diego, and local hospitals are making sure they're prepared for its arrival. With close to a hundred more cases reported this week, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the country is likely to see the most measles cases in nearly 2 decades.

The threat has moved Rady Children's Hospital to make sure its negative pressure rooms, or isolation rooms -- sealed rooms that don't allow air to escape into the rest of the hospital -- are primed and ready. "It's a scary situation right now, knowing that there are multiple outbreaks across the country," Rady's Infection Control Coordinator, nurse Megan Medina, said. "We're always worried about that measles case that walks through that door and potentially expose all of our patients here in the hospital."

Medina says the isolation rooms don't allow airborne sicknesses like tuberculosis or measles to spread in the building. "We want to make sure that those microorganisms that come off that patient stay in this room and aren't moving to other rooms," she said. The germy air gets cleaned through a filter in the ceiling and is released outside.

Depending on the severity of the case, an admitted measles patient could spend anywhere from a few days to a few weeks in isolation.

[7] California (Butte County): measles on top of wildfires
Date: Sun 21 Apr 2019

https://www.pressherald.com/2019/04/21/measles-outbreak-tests-health-workers-already-stretched-thin-by-wildfire/


Northern California health workers are scrambling to control a growing measles outbreak centered on a region that is still reeling from the most destructive wildfire in state history. In November [2018], the Camp fire decimated the town of Paradise, killed 85 people and left behind billions of dollars in damage. Butte County, about 90 miles north of Sacramento, continues to grapple with the consequences of the blaze.

So the arrival of measles seems to residents like just the latest in a string of bad luck. As of Fri [19 Apr 2019], at least 15 Californians had been diagnosed with measles as part of the outbreak that began last month [March 2019] in Butte County, according to health officials. "It feels like we keep getting hit with a new disaster every few months," said Cassie Miracle, who runs a health coalition in Chico, the biggest city in Butte County.

The Butte County outbreak began when a man caught measles in March [2019] during a trip to the Philippines, where thousands of people have come down with the disease this year [2019]. The outbreak has expanded outside Butte to Placer, Tehama and Shasta counties.

In California, 23 people statewide have been diagnosed with measles this year [2019], according to state data released Thursday [18 Apr 2019]. Though the Butte County outbreak is the largest cluster, there have been a smattering of cases around the state.

[8] New York (Rockland County): 2nd emergency declared

https://abc7ny.com/health/rockland-declares-2nd-emergency-over-measles-outbreak/5270743/


Rockland County Executive Ed Day issued a 2nd declaration of a local State of Emergency [Thu 25 Apr 2019] amid the measles outbreak, renewing the original declaration that was due to expire at 11:59 PM. The renewed State of Emergency takes effect at midnight [Fri 26 Apr 2019] and will remain in effect until 11:59 PM, Sat 25 May 2019.

The new emergency declaration does not contain the Measles Outbreak Emergency Directive, which prohibited non-vaccinated persons from entering indoor places of public assembly. That directive was overturned by a judge, and subsequent appeals have been denied.

However, the Rockland County Department of Health will continue to enforce the new Commissioner's Orders that were announced last week, which mandates that anyone with measles or anyone exposed to the illness avoid public spaces or face a USD 2000-a-day fine.

"Over the last 30 days since my original declaration we have lost the one thing we couldn't afford to lose, valuable time," Day said. "With nearly 50 new confirmed cases in less than a month, what we predicted has come true -- this outbreak continues to rage despite the best efforts of our Department of Health."

The order also applies to students who are required to have the proper MMR immunizations and to date have not demonstrated that the vaccines have been administered. This does not apply to students with medical or religious exemptions.

"The disagreement amongst the various courts has undoubtedly caused confusion and contributed to this situation continuing," Day said. "However, I pledge that we will continue to do everything within our power to combat this deadly disease and bring it to a stop once and for all."

Officials say 19 279 MMR vaccinations have been given within Rockland County since the outbreak began in October 2018. There have been no fatalities amid the current outbreak, and only 3 measles-related deaths in the US in the past 2 decades.

One confirmed case of measles in an adult in Broward County is raising concern with health officials as cases continue to grow in other states around the country. The Broward measles case is the only one in Florida so far in 2019.

"Unfortunately it is a concern for us in the health care profession and the population in general," says Dr. Chad Sanborn at Palm Beach Children's Hospital. "A typical case can spread to up to 16 to 19 different people; it is very contagious," Dr. Sanborn says.

Parents held a rally on Tue [23 Apr 2019] at the state capitol against a bill that would allow the state to track individual vaccination decisions.

[11] Washington state: bill limits measles vaccine exemptions
Date: Tue 23 Apr 2019 9:17 PM ET
Source: ABC News, Associated Press (AP) report [abridged, edited]
https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/washington-state-bill-limits-measles-vaccine-exemptions-62586541


Washington state lawmakers voted [Tue 23 Apr 2019] to remove parents' ability to claim a personal or philosophical exemption from vaccinating their children for measles, although medical and religious exemptions will remain.

The measure now heads to Governor Jay Inslee, who has expressed support for limiting exemptions. The state has seen 74 cases of measles this year [2019]. Most of those cases were centered in one county and involved children 10 years or younger who were not immunized.

Washington is among 17 states that allow some type of non-medical vaccine exemption for personal or philosophical beliefs. In addition, medical and religious exemptions exist for attendance at the state's public or private schools or licensed day-care centers. Medical and religious exemptions remain in place under the measure.

Unless an exemption is claimed, children are required to be vaccinated against or show proof of acquired immunity for nearly a dozen diseases -- including polio, whooping cough and measles -- before they can attend school or go to child-care centers.

The state Department of Health said that 4% of Washington grades K-12 students have non-medical vaccine exemptions. Of those, 3.7% of the exemptions are personal, and the rest are religious.

While the Senate had 1st sought a bill that would have removed the philosophical exemption for all required childhood vaccines, both chambers ultimately agreed to move forward with the House bill that focused only on the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

[12] Workplace vaccination
Date: Wed 24 Apr 2019
Source: Quartz [abridged, edited]
https://qz.com/work/1601957/what-to-do-if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-measles-at-work/


Last week, employees at one of Google's Mountain View (California) campus buildings received an unsettling memo from a company physician: a Googler who visited that office earlier this month [April 2019] had been diagnosed with the measles, it announced. Details were scant, but employees were urged to read an advisory from the local health authorities.

Days before that, headlines reported that a flight attendant for Israel's El Al airline had slipped into a coma after developing measles-related encephalitis. That company began vaccinating its crews immediately, setting up a clinic at the Ben Gurion airport. Now, Israel's Health Ministry is urging all of the country's airlines to do the same.

Both cases illustrate an alarming fact: The measles, a highly contagious viral infection that was all but eradicated in much of the world decades ago, has once again become a concern for all workplaces -- not only schools and hospitals, where there's a higher risk of exposure from infected children. For those who are not vaccinated, the danger is everywhere, says Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at Columbia University.

Morse argues that employers should start treating the measles like it's their problem, too. Companies ought to make it easy for workers who know or suspect they need to get vaccinated to visit a doctor's office and still be compensated. Even better, they could hold on-site vaccination clinics, as many companies do for the flu, he suggests, eliminating the inconvenience factor as an excuse for not getting jabbed.

Cases of measles in Ireland more than doubled last year [2018], according to a United Nations report that has revealed that outbreaks of the virus are on the rise globally. According to the report by UNICEF, an estimated 169 million children missed out on the 1st dose of the measles vaccine between 2010 and 2017. It found that an increase in the number of unvaccinated children throughout the world has allowed the disease to make a comeback in several countries, including some which had previously declared the virus eliminated.

Cases of measles increased in 98 countries around the world from 2017 to 2018, with cases in Ireland growing by more than 200%, from 25 in 2017 to 86 in 2018. Meanwhile, more than 110 000 measles cases were reported worldwide during the first 3 months of 2019 -- an increase of nearly 300% from the same period last year [2018].

"The foundation for the global measles outbreaks we are witnessing today was laid years ago," said Peter Power, UNICEF Ireland's Executive Director. "The measles virus will always find unvaccinated children. If we are serious about averting the spread of this dangerous but preventable disease, we need to vaccinate every child, in rich and poor countries alike."

Two doses of the measles vaccine are essential to protect children from the disease, with global coverage of the 1st dose reported at 85% in 2017, a figure that has remained relatively constant over the past decade.

Anti-vax movement
----------------
However, fear or skepticism about vaccines, as well as lack of access, poor health systems, and complacency has seen the global coverage for the 2nd dose drop to 67%. In high-income countries, coverage with the 1st dose is 94%, but coverage for the 2nd dose drops to 91%.

Resurgence of disease has been partly linked to the growing anti-vaccine movement in richer countries, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified as a major global health threat. The anti-vax phenomenon has adherents across Western countries but is particularly high-profile in the US, where it has been driven by baseless claims on social media.

The US tops the list of high-income countries with the most children not receiving the 1st dose of the vaccine between 2010 and 2017, at more than 2.5 million. The country recorded 695 cases of measles in 2019, the most of any year since the disease was declared eliminated at the turn of the century, and surpassing the previous high of 667 reached in 2014.

"A significant factor contributing to the outbreaks in New York is misinformation in the communities about the safety of the measles/mumps/rubella vaccine," the country's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.

In a separate statement confirming the new record, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said, "measles vaccines are among the most extensively studied medical products we have, and their safety has been firmly established over many years."

Rates of non-vaccination were 2nd- and 3rd-highest in France and the UK, respectively, where there were more than 600 000 and 500 000 unvaccinated infants between 2010 and 2017.

[14] Bulgaria
Date: Sat 20 Apr 2019
Source: The Sofia Globe [abridged, edited]
https://sofiaglobe.com/2019/04/20/460-measles-cases-registered-in-bulgaria-placing-it-sixth-in-europe/


There are currently 460 cases of measles in Bulgaria, ranking it 6th in Europe, Chief State Health Inspector Associate Professor Angel Kunchev told a conference on 20 Apr [2019]. The figure means that the number of measles cases in Bulgaria has doubled in less than a month.

Of the total, 20% to 22% are younger than 13 months, thus younger than immunisation age, and three-quarters are children of Roma ethnicity, according to figures presented at the conference. The largest numbers of cases are in Sofia -- 124 in the city and 165 in the district. This is followed by Blagoevgrad, previously the district with the largest number, now totalling 135.

Kunchev said that in 2018, about 65 000 children across the world died of measles.

The outbreak of measles in Bulgaria, which started in the Blagoevgrad district in late 2018, was imported from North Macedonia, which in the past week declared a measles outbreak throughout the country. A family from North Macedonia came on a skiing holiday in Bansko, and after a few days, one of the children became ill. He was admitted to hospital in Razlog, where the necessary measures against the spread of the illness were not taken, resulting in a measles outbreak in the children's ward of the hospital, with an initial 16 infections.

[15] African region: resurgent measles outbreaks
Date: Wed 24 Apr 2019
Source: Africa Science News (ASNS) [abridged, edited]
http://africasciencenews.org/resurgent-measles-outbreaks-partners-call-for-renewed-efforts-to-vaccinate-all-children/


The global measles crisis is an urgent wake-up call to the need for countries to ensure that all children -- no matter where they live -- receive life-saving vaccines. Countries in the African region have also experienced a resurgence of measles, including outbreaks reported in at least 9 countries (Chad, Cameroon, DR Congo, Liberia, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali, Nigeria and Uganda) in the past 12 months. Madagascar, in particular, has had a large measles outbreak affecting more than 122 000 cases in the months between October 2018 and April 2019.

A highly contagious disease that accounts for 13% of all vaccine-preventable deaths in children younger than 5 years in Africa, measles infects 9 in 10 people who are not vaccinated. As of 2017, only 16 countries in the World Health Organization's African region had achieved 90% or more immunization coverage of the 1st dose of measles vaccine (MCV1), according to the WHO UNICEF coverage estimates. Across the region, MCV1 coverage has stagnated at 70% to 73% since 2009.

At the launch of the 9th African Vaccination Week today [24 Apr 2019] in Sao Tome and Principe, immunization partners stressed the importance of countries remaining vigilant in the fight against vaccine-preventable diseases.

The theme for this year's [2019] African Vaccination Week is "Protected Together: Vaccines Work!", emphasizing the power of vaccines in saving lives and keeping everyone healthy, from infants to elders. African Vaccination Week, from 22 to 28 Apr 2019, also celebrates the vaccination heroes who help expand the coverage of immunization services across the African region -- from parents and community leaders to health workers and innovators.

"We need to work together to improve immunization delivery so that all children are protected from preventable diseases. Recent disease outbreaks on the continent remind us of the urgency of this goal," said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization Regional Director for Africa. "Outbreaks of measles in Madagascar and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo underscore the need for increased investments in immunization as a fundamental part of strengthening primary health care systems," she also stressed.

One in 5 children in Africa still does not have access to all the necessary and basic vaccines a child should receive. Every year, more than 30 million children younger than 5 years in Africa fall sick due to vaccine-preventable diseases. Of them, more than half a million die -- representing 56% of the global deaths related to vaccine-preventable diseases.

In Africa, vaccine-preventable diseases also impose an economic burden of USD 13 billion every year -- funding that could be used to fuel economies and drive development.

In 2017, African Heads of State endorsed the Addis Declaration on Immunization at the African Union Summit, committing to reach all children with life-saving vaccines. While political will for immunization across the region is high, African Vaccination Week 2019 is a reminder for countries to renew their commitments and redouble efforts to achieve universal access to vaccines.

[16] South Sudan: vaccine concerns
Date: Wed 24 Apr 2019
Source: Medical Xpress [abridged, edited]
https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-04-south-sudan-measles-outbreak-vaccines.html


Despondent, [AM] points to 2 small mounds of dirt where she buried her grandsons, 4 and 5 years old, last month [March 2019]. They died after contracting measles in one of the worst-hit areas of South Sudan's latest outbreak.

"Every time I see the graves I feel like crying," she said. The family said the boys had been vaccinated against the highly infectious disease. Similar infections are prompting questions about whether some vaccines have been compromised in a country largely devastated by conflict.

As South Sudan emerges from a 5-year civil war, more than 750 measles cases, including 7 deaths, have been reported since January [2019]. That's almost 6 times the number of cases for all of 2018, according to World Health Organization data.

The increase in measles cases is part of a global one, in part because of misinformation that makes some parents balk at receiving a vaccine. WHO noted a 300% increase in reported measles cases worldwide in the first 3 months of this year [2019] compared with the same period last year [2018].

Many in developing countries don't dispute the vaccine but instead are held back by lack of access. Measles, spread by coughing, sneezing, close contact or infected surfaces, has no specific treatment. Malnourished children and those with weak immune systems can develop severe complications that can lead to death -- and malnourishment can reduce how well the vaccine protects them.

Though an emergency vaccination campaign is underway in South Sudan's 12 affected counties, the outbreak is spreading, leading some health officials and residents to doubt the vaccine's viability in some cases. "Those kids were vaccinated but they died. It makes me wonder if the vaccine is working," the boys' uncle told The Associated Press (AP) during a visit to Kuajok town earlier this month [April 2019]. At least 2 other vaccinated children in his family contracted measles, he said.

While the AP could not independently verify that the children had been vaccinated, medical workers at Kuajok Hospital are seeing some vaccinated children contract measles, said Dr. Garang Nyuol. He has seen more than 10 such cases since January [2019].

To ensure the integrity of the highly effective measles vaccine, it must be kept at between 2 deg C (35 deg F) and 8 deg C (46 deg F). Kuajok Hospital, Gogrial state's main medical facility, administers measles vaccines year-round, yet several staffers said its 2 generators often shut down for hours, even days, at a time.

"I'm worried about the effectiveness of the vaccine," Chok Deng, the director general for the state's ministry of health, told the AP. He said he reached out to the United Nations children's agency and WHO for help and was told it was being "followed up."

UNICEF, which provides the majority of vaccines in South Sudan as well as freezers and generators, said the system is designed to be self-sufficient for 16 hours in case of a power failure. The organization conducts regular maintenance and has not "received any messages about generators in Kuajok not running properly," said Penelope Campbell, chief of health for UNICEF in South Sudan.

Dr. Ujjiga Thomas, WHO's Kuajok hub coordinator, said that "at no time has the cold chain been compromised when it comes to fuel or spare parts" at the hospital.

During power outages, medical workers at the hospital move the vaccines to small mobile refrigerators, but experts say a constant shift in temperature reduces the vaccines' strength.

"If we do not respect the storage temperatures, that can compromise the vaccine's effectiveness," said Dr. Alhassane Toure, a vaccination expert with WHO.

Maintaining the cold chain is a challenge across South Sudan, especially in remote areas. An internal document in April [2019] from the country's health cluster, comprising various aid groups, seen by the AP cited a shortage of "qualified cold chain technicians" to address maintenance issues.

A visit to the Kuajok Hospital showed the challenges in containing South Sudan's measles outbreak. Just one nurse is available for 50 patients. The isolation tent is so hot that patients lie on the ground throughout the compound instead, at risk of infecting others.

"It's concerning, outbreaks are popping up all over the place," said Natalie Page, health adviser for Medair South Sudan, which recently vaccinated more than 190 000 children in Gogrial state.

Low vaccination rates allow measles to spread quickly, she said. Just 59% of children under 5 years of age in South Sudan have received the measles vaccine, according to the health ministry. Overall immunization rates need to be 90% to 95% or higher to prevent outbreaks. In order for the vaccine to have maximum efficacy, children need to receive 2 doses.

With the rainy season starting in May, there is concern that reaching remote communities will become more difficult. Meanwhile, 3 to 10 new cases arrive at Kuajok's Hospital daily.

No fewer than 17 children within the age bracket of 6 months to 5 years have been confirmed dead while 10 000 cases were recorded within 14 weeks of a measles outbreak in Borno State. The Director, Disease Control, under the State Primary Health Development Agency, Babagana Abiso, disclosed this in an interview with leadership on Sunday [21 Apr 2019] in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital.

Abiso said government is conducting reactive vaccination in prioritised 15 local government areas of the state to children aged 6 months to 6 years to curtail the outbreak. He said: "We have an outbreak of measles in the state and this started from week 1 of January [2019], and by week 14, we had recorded nearly 10 000 cases all over the state. And the disease, you know, affects children. We have recorded 17 deaths. The government is making efforts to conduct reactive vaccination against measles in the affected areas.

"Because of shortage of vaccine, we visited only Maiduguri Metropolitan Council (MMC) to commence the vaccination. We have covered about 8 wards that are seriously affected, and for the remaining 12 local government areas, as soon as we receive vaccines from the national level, we will ensure that all the prioritised areas get vaccination."

He said those mostly affected by measles are children aged 6 months to 5 years, noting that the state decided to extend the vaccination to children aged 6 years so as not to take any chances. Meanwhile, when our correspondent visited the measles section of the State Specialist Hospital, Maiduguri, a good number of children severely hit by the disease were on admission, with the outpatients administered with drugs and discharged.

A doctor on duty, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said even though the disease is rampant during heat, the cause could also be attributed to the influx of internally displaced persons (IDPs) whose children were not vaccinated before fleeing their communities.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is investigating a measles outbreak in central Mumbai after at least 40 fresh cases were reported from areas that reported high rates of refusal during the recent vaccination programme. Eight suspected outbreaks have been reported since January [2019]. An outbreak is a cluster of at least 5 cases from the same area, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Health officials suspect one death may have been caused by the disease.

According to the BMC, none of the patients who have been clinically diagnosed with measles have been vaccinated against the disease. "These cases are from areas where people and school officials have repeatedly refused vaccinations," said a senior official from the BMC's health department. Clinical diagnosis is made on the basis of visible symptoms, like fever and a rash. The presence of the virus will be confirmed after tests by the National Institute of Virology (NIV).

In November 2018, the BMC started a campaign to vaccinate 2.5 million children between the ages of 9 months and 15 years against measles and rubella. However, only 89% of the city was covered. Mumbai is among the 5 districts in Maharashtra to not achieve this target, said Dr. Archana Patil, additional director, Directorate of Health Services.

An 11-month-old baby has contracted measles, bringing the total number of cases in Auckland to 18. Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) was notified of the case over Easter.

So far this year [2019], 10 people have been hospitalised for the disease in Auckland. As of Tuesday [23 Apr 2019] afternoon, 2 people were in quarantine and ARPHS has contacted, or is contacting, more than 1500 people who may have been exposed to measles.

ARPHS previously stated there were 18 cases, but one was later reclassified.

A man aged in his 20s has been diagnosed with measles at Dubbo, prompting an alert for residents, including people present at 2 medical facilities at times earlier this month [April 2019], to watch for symptoms of the highly contagious disease.

The unvaccinated 22-year-old was diagnosed in Dubbo after returning from 3 weeks in New Zealand, health authorities report. His case is the 37th notification of measles in New South Wales since Christmas [2018].
