Test Results as of 5 Sep 2002
Humans
------
Blood and/or spinal fluid samples from 73 residents are being tested for
the presence of WNV. These individuals either had symptoms or signs that
met the established WNV testing criteria or exhibited most of the symptoms
and are from counties where dead crows and/or mosquitoes with the virus
have been discovered.
To date, 32 are negative, 40 tests are pending, and one positive. Test
results are sent to the CDC for confirmation.
Crows, American kestrels, and other birds
-----------------------------------------
To date, 834 crows have been accepted for testing; 569 crows found in 19
counties have been confirmed positive for the presence of WNV. Positive
crows have been found in Atlantic (20), Bergen (70), Burlington (42),
Camden (20), Cape May (1), Cumberland (6), Essex (4), Gloucester (24),
Hunterdon (8), Mercer (39), Middlesex (37), Monmouth (135), Morris (48),
Ocean (51), Passaic (23), Salem (7), Somerset (18), Union (11), and Warren
(5) Counties. The department has also received 233 bird samples (mostly
crows) deemed unsatisfactory for testing and has been notified of 909 dead
or ill birds (mostly crows) not submitted for testing due to their condition.
Mosquitoes
----------
To date, 5556 mosquito pools have been tested in the state laboratory for
the presence of WNV and 203 pools found in 19 counties have tested positive
for WNV. Positive mosquitoes were collected in Atlantic (15) Bergen (58),
Burlington (8), Camden (4), Cape May (2), Essex (1), Gloucester (2), Hudson
(1), Hunterdon (3), Mercer (2), Middlesex (21), Monmouth (17), Morris (15),
Ocean (12), Passaic (29), Salem (1), Somerset (4), Union (6) and Warren (2)
Counties.
Horses
------
Equine testing is conducted by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture's
animal health laboratory in Trenton, and positive results are sent to the
National Veterinary Services Lab (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa for confirmation. For
more information, visit the Department of Agriculture website:
.
Notes
-----
Between 1999 and 2002, lab testing confirmed WNV infection in 18 New Jersey
residents, and one 2002 case pending confirmation, with 2 resulting
fatalities. The virus has also been detected in mosquitoes, horses, or
crows and other birds in every county in New Jersey.

Utah resident may have caught West Nile back east
-----------------------------------------------
State health officials believe the first Utah resident has been infected
with WNV, but it was acquired out of state and poses no danger to others in
Utah, they say. "Humans and horses do not create enough of the virus" to
make it possible even for a mosquito to become infected, said Jenifer
Lloyd, epidemiologist and West Nile coordinator for the Utah Department of
Health. Birds can produce a very heavy viral load, and it is through them
the virus has been transmitted to mosquitoes, who in turn can transmit it
to humans and horses. Humans cannot transmit the illness anywhere; "They're
a dead-end host," Lloyd said.
On Thursday, department spokesman Stephen P McDonald said his state lab
found the virus in a blood sample taken from a man who traveled back east
in July [2002] and became ill shortly before coming home. An observant Utah
doctor asked him where he'd been and sent specimens for testing to see if
he'd contracted the virus. It's classified as "probable" infection until it
is confirmed by CDC, which will take at least 2 more weeks.
Though there's no evidence the virus has year reached Utah through normal
routes, it is in states just east of Utah, McDonald said. The health
department is conducting "intensive surveillance" efforts looking for the
virus here.

Over 400 horses confirmed with West Nile virus
----------------------------------------------
The number of WNV cases continues to rise in Nebraska horses, with more
than 400 testing positive with the disease. The Nebraska Department of
Agriculture on Wed 4 Sep 2002 released its latest numbers, with 441
positive equine cases documented in 73 Nebraska counties. The first equine
case in Nebraska was confirmed on 6 Aug 2002.
The total confirmed cases include: Sioux-5; Scotts Bluff-46; Dawes-3; Box
Butte-3; Morrill-1; Sheridan-6; Cherry-10; Grant-5; Arthur-3; Keith-18;
Perkins-4; Chase-1; Hayes-2; Lincoln-20; Logan-1; Keya Paha-2; Brown-11;

Burt-2; Pierce-4; Wayne-1; Cedar-4; Dixon-3; Dakota-2; Thurston-1.
WNV causes encephalitis in humans and equines. The virus is transmitted by
mosquitoes, which acquire it from infected birds. Horses, mules, and
donkeys are infected when bitten by an infected mosquito. The virus does
not spread from equine to equine or from equine to human. Clinical signs
include loss of appetite, depression, fever, stumbling, weakness of hind
limbs, paralysis of hind limbs, impaired vision, and convulsions.

The West Nile virus has been found in a horse that had just returned from a
3 month stay in Minnesota, Arizona health officials said Thu 5 Sep 2002.
However, they cautioned there have been no reported cases of the virus in
humans, animals, birds, or mosquitos in Arizona.
The infected horse returned to Pima County on 26 Aug 2002 and began showing
neurological signs, according to Arizona health officials, who said the
animal was euthanized 3 days later. Biological samples were tested at the
University of Arizona's lab and the National Veterinary Services Laboratory
in Ames, Iowa, for confirmation of the infection. "This case does not
indicate that there is any new health threat due to West Nile virus in
Arizona. However, it does show that our West Nile virus detection and
laboratory systems are functioning well," said Mira Leslie, a state public
health veterinarian with the Arizona Department of Health Services.

Labor Day weekend 2002 brought news of another risk related to WNV, with a
growing body of evidence that the virus can be transmitted via organ
transplant from an infected person (and an associated risk that it might
also be transmitted by blood transfusion). While this adds a wrinkle to the
set of assumptions about disease transmission, the general population is at
no greater risk of contracting WNV than previously thought. The news does
make us aware that a subpopulation of people about to undergo high-risk
organ transplants and/or receive blood transfusions may be at still greater
health risk due to the increased risk of contracting WNV. However, CDC
health officials point out that the additional risk of contracting WNV is
quite small in comparison with the much larger risks from these medical
procedures. Research is underway to learn more about these possible means
of transmission and to develop more rapid tests for determining whether
asymptomatic people are infected with WNV. More information is given in the
6 Sep 2002 Morbidity and mortality Weekly Report
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5135a5.htm>, transcript of the
3 Sep 2002 CDC news conference, and in postings to the WESTNILEVIRUS-L
listserv 3-4 Sep 2002.
By the third week in August WNV had passed the 108th meridian on its trek
west, now detected as far west as Shepherd in Yellowstone County, Montana.
Thus far in 2002, WNV has been detected in at least 3243 dead crows and
2232 other dead birds as well as 99 sentinel chicken flocks (in FL, NE, PA,
and NYC), 1947 mosquito pools, 737 humans, 1159 horses and/or other mammals
in at least 41 states and Washington DC in the US; as well as in Manitoba,
Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan provinces in Canada; and in people and
mosquitoes in Israel.
Imported human cases have been confirmed in Mexico, with possible
confirmations in birds in the Yucatan. WNV has been most recently reported
for the first time from New Mexico and Montana (22 Aug 2002), Colorado and
Wyoming (16 Aug 2002), South Carolina (13 Aug 2002), and from Vermont, for
the first time since 2000 (6 Aug 2002). Its range has expanded in each of
the 4 years since the initial North American outbreak in 1999, and has
expanded considerably in 2002, into 13 states where it had not previously
been seen (Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico,
North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia,
and Wyoming). In the Continental US only the 7 westernmost states have not
reported WNV detections.
Human cases
-----------
The number of human cases is increasing rapidly, with at least 737 cases
(40 fatalities) in 28 states and Washington DC reported by CDC on 4 Sept
2002 as confirmed or probable. This compares with 673 cases (32 fatalities)
in 27 states reported earlier 4 Sep 2002; 480 cases (24 fatalities) in 22
states reported 28 Aug 2002; 210 cases reported 21 Aug 2002; and 156 cases
reported a week earlier, on 14 Aug 2002. The largest case load is in the
Gulf Coast states and further north in the Mississippi River states. [For
details, see the state-by-state tallies compiled and posted by CDC:
<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/wncount.htm>]
In the most recent (6 Sep 2002) CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report
(MMWR) <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5135a6.htm>, CDC reports
that among patients for whom data are known, median age = 52 years (range:
9 months to 98 years); 341 (57 per cent) are male, and the dates of illness
onset range from 10 June to 28 Aug 2002. A total of 35 human deaths have
been reported. The median age of decedents was 76 years (range: 48 to 94
years); 20 (57 per cent) deaths were among men. The previous MMWR (30 Aug
2002) reported that among patients for whom data were known, median age =
51 (range: 9 months-98 years), 237 (54 percent) male, with dates of illness
onset ranging from 10 Jun to 25 Aug 2002.
Several of the human cases reported early in the season were contracted
while traveling in another state, and therefore tallies of human cases by
state of residence are not completely consistent with those tallied by the
location of the illness.
