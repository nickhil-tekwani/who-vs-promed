Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 22

Headlines
- As of [1 Jan 2019], WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has taken over as the Chair of the Polio Oversight Board. Starting on [4 Jan 2019], accompanied by Dr. Al Mandhari, RD/EMRO, Dr. Tedros' 1st trip will be to Kabul, Afghanistan and Islamabad, Pakistan to meet with heads of state and polio teams to reinvigorate support for polio eradication.

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Afghanistan: 4 WPV1-positive environmental samples
- Pakistan: 2 WPV1-positive environmental samples

Afghanistan
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2019 is zero.
- A total of 4 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported this week: one from Khandak district, one from Karwan Kocha, one from Loya Wiala, and one from Rarobat district -- all located in Kandahar province. All samples were collected on [6 Dec 2018].
- Afghanistan recently concluded a targeted national campaign.

Pakistan
- No cases of WPV1 were reported this week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2019 in the country is zero.
- A total of 2 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: one from South Waziristan district of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and one from Pishin district in Baluchistan. Samples were collected between [21 Nov 2018 and 2 Dec 2018].
- It is important to note of the 5 districts reporting cases in 2018, 3 were from areas outside the core reservoirs.

Nigeria
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported this week.
- No cases of WPV1 were reported. The most recently detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the 1st centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states, as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- No case of cVDPV2 has been reported in the past week.
- Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigations and risk assessments to more clearly assess risk of the identified cVDPV2 and to conduct additional response measures as appropriate and necessary.
- Active case finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.
- WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to strengthen the risk communication and community engagement.

Central Africa
- No cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
- DRC is affected by 4 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, in the provinces of Haut Katanga, Mongala, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- Following the Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication in July 2016, the 2 large-scale vaccination rounds implemented during September and October 2018 demonstrated better vaccination quality. Planning is underway to maintain the gains made so far and maintain population immunity as well as sensitive surveillance across the country.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will continue to support authorities across the country to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- No cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week.
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3, reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia. Another vaccination round is planned during end-November [2018] [was conducted?] as part of the ongoing outbreak response, to further enhance the population immunity in the highest risk areas. Special surveillance activities continue to be undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of cVDPV1 were reported this week.
- Emergency operation centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- A total of 3 SIAs of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15 years, due to large numbers of poorly immunized older children.
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

[Given the "lag time" between onset of illness and laboratory results, the final tally for 2018 will not be complete for at least another month, so at present the numbers cited as 29 cases of WPV1-associated disease (29 cases) and 100 cases of cVDPV-associated disease are not the final numbers for 2018.

In this week's update, while there were no newly confirmed cases of both WPV1 and cVDPV disease, environmental samples confirmed the continued circulation of the WPV1 in both Afghanistan (Kandahar province) and Pakistan (the FATA - Federally Administered Tribal Area and Balochistan province), so the possibility of identifying additional cases of WPV1-associated disease in 2018 is still there. The absence of reports of cVDPV-positive environmental samples in those countries where environmental sampling is performed does not entirely rule out continued circulation of the virus in other areas within these countries where sampling is not performed.

Time will tell.
