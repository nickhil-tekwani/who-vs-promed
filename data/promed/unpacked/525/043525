For the 1st time since 2001, significant levels of septoria tritici blotch (STB) [have been identified] in commercial wheat crops in New South Wales. Andrew Milgate, [NSW Department of Primary Industries] (DPI) said: "The severity of infection is concerning. STB has become a significant foliar disease in regions of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. Re-emergence of STB in NSW poses a threat in high rainfall areas."

Dr Milgate said changes in virulence to variety resistance and the development of fungicide resistance in the STB population was of particular concern. "Triazole fungicide resistance has been confirmed in Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania [and] now in NSW."

It is critical that growers adopt strategies to reduce selection rates of further mutations to maintain and extend the useful life of currently available fungicides.

[Septoria leaf blotch of cereals is caused by fungi in the septoria species complex, which includes _Zymoseptoria tritici_ (previously _Septoria tritici_), _Mycosphaerella graminicola_ and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_ (previously _Stagonospora nodorum_). They affect mainly wheat, but also barley and oats and occasionally rye and some grass species. Symptoms on wheat and barley are very similar and may occur at any time during the growth cycle and on any portion of the plant. They include blotches on both leaves and glumes, which reduce the photosynthetic ability of the host. Disease development is favoured by humid conditions. Up to 50 per cent yield losses have been reported on susceptible varieties.

Spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind, water (rain splash) and mechanical means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop debris and on autumn sown crops or volunteers. Disease management includes fungicide treatments aimed at preventing the disease becoming established on the upper 3 leaves of the crop canopy, removal of inoculum sources and use of resistant varieties. After the cereal rusts, the disease is considered the most important challenge to plant breeders (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190) and a threat to food security worldwide.

Pathogen strains with high levels of resistance to many fungicides are emerging, for example, in the UK and other parts of Europe (ProMED-mail post 20160516.4225677), as well as New Zealand (ProMED-mail post 20140417.2410219). In Australia, STB was reported as the 1st wheat disease developing fungicide resistance on that continent (ProMED-mail post 20140313.2329774).
