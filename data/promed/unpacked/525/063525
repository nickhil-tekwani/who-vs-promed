Children under surveillance in Manipur, India
--------------------------------------------------
Health officials in India were monitoring 4 children suffering from
fever on Wed [1 Aug 2007] after they had contact with dead or sick
poultry in Manipur state, where authorities are fighting a bird flu
outbreak in fowl.

The children have been [confined] to their homes and are being
visited twice daily by medical professionals, said Vineet Chawdhry,
joint secretary in the Ministry of Health. "We are being extra
careful," Chawdhry said, adding that throat swabs and blood samples
taken from the children had been sent to a federal laboratory, where
tests for the H5N1 strain of bird flu will be carried out. The
children live within a 5-km (3-mile) radius of a small poultry farm
where more than 130 chickens died last month [Jul 2007] from the H5N1 virus.

Health officials have checked more than 235 000 people around the
affected farm since the weekend [28-29 Jul 2007] for flu symptoms,
while veterinary workers have culled a similar number of birds in the
remote northeastern state.

India had two major flare-ups of bird flu in its western region last
year [2006]. Manipur is located in the far north-east of India
adjacent to Myanmar [formerly Burma], which has battled several
outbreaks of bird flu in chickens this year [2007], including one
reported last week.

Globally, at least 192 people have died due to bird flu out of 319
cases since 2003, the World Health Organisation says. The H5N1 strain
remains mainly a bird virus but experts fear it may mutate into a
form that passes easily between humans, triggering an influenza
epidemic in which millions could die.

far north-east adjacent to Myanmar (formerly Burma).

The Indian medical authorities have undertaken an extensive
surveillance operation targeting more than 235 000 people resident in
the regions of Manipur state affected by outbreaks of avian H5N1
influenza in poultry. Apart from their vulnerable age, it is unclear
why these 4 children have been singled out for special attention, but
not apparently sufficiently ill to be admitted to hospital. Further
information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
