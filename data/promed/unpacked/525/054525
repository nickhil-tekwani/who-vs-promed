SFH [secretary for food and health] on avian influenza
------------------------------------------------------
Following is the transcript of remarks made by the secretary for food and
health (SFH), Dr York Chow, at a stand-up media session at the West Wing
lobby of Central Government Offices today (9 Dec 2008):

SFH: We have received a report from the Agriculture, Fisheries and
Conservation Department (AFCD) that there was an outbreak of chicken deaths
in one chicken farm in Yuen Long yesterday morning [8 Dec 2008]. We have
discovered that there were up to 60 dead chickens in that farm, and after a
series of tests, we have confirmed this morning that the chickens died from
H5 virus. We had a meeting with all the concerned departments this
afternoon including the AFCD, the Department of Health, and the Food and
Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD). And with the recommendation of the
AFCD, I have elevated the alert state of avian influenza to "serious"
starting from now.

The AFCD has already declared the affected farm as the index farm. And from
that we have drawn a 3 km (1.9 mi) radius, so that any chicken in that area
will be considered infected. The total infected farms would be 2, and
altogether there were about 80 000 chickens. We shall cull those chickens,
starting from the index farm, and then the 2nd farm.

We had also decided that we shall ban all the outlets of chickens from our
farms for 21 days, and also suspend all the import of chicken and poultry
including birds for the next 21 days.

Since there are also chickens stored in Cheung Sha Wan Wholesale Market,
they will also be culled starting from tomorrow [10 Dec 2008].

The AFCD and the FEHD would also clean up those retail outlets and the
wholesale market, to ensure that there would not be any more spreading of
the virus. The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) will contact the owners
and the workers of the affected farms, to make sure they are not infected.
So far we have not received any information about people being affected.
Hong Kong is facing a new alert of avian flu. We should be more cautious
particularly with the winter coming and also the appearance of H5 virus in
our farm. I hope that all the citizens would be more cautious and ensure
they look after themselves well, and also ensure they have a good personal
hygiene and environmental hygiene.

Reporter: How could this happen again?

SFH: The last time we [had an] outbreak in a farm [was] at the end of 2002.
With all the measures taken in the last 6 years, so far we did not have any
outbreaks in any farms. This time round we are concerned about whether it
would lead to such an outbreak. Now that the deaths were chickens breeders
and also the so-called sentinel chicken, that is, chicken that had not been
vaccinated. We also found more vaccinated chickens being affected. We have
to investigate the cause of the outbreak, and the sequence of the outbreak.
We have to analyse the whole situation. And obviously we are concerned
where the virus [came] from, as you know that virus exists in our natural
environment with all the wild birds. This is something that we [are] always
aware of. But whether there is any biosecurity lapse in the farm or whether
there is any contamination of any sort inside the farm, that requires more
investigations.

Reporter: (inaudible)

AFCD assistant director (inspection & quarantine) Dr Thomas Sit: We know
the viruses existed in the region especially in the wintertime. The
migrating birds and the wild birds will carry the virus. And during our
surveillance in the last few years, you know the viruses present in the
wild birds and the dead birds surveillance. That's why we had to
investigate whether there will be some contamination from the wild bird
species or other means for the virus to get into the farm and [infect the
chickens]. We will conduct investigations including taking blood samples
and faecal samples in the affected farm.

Reporter: Does that mean the vaccine is useless?

SFH: We cannot confirm this yet, but according to the facts received, there
are also [vaccinated] chickens affected. So we have to investigate on both,
whether the virus has changed or whether the vaccination has changed
[their] immunity.

Reporter: ... or any changes of the...?

SFH: We cannot conclude in just a couple of days. Usually, virus sequencing
would take actually a few days, or up to 2 or 3 weeks before we can be
certain. We will be doing more tests on this virus and we are also working
with the Hong Kong University on this.

Reporter: (inaudible)

SFH: We have been using the same vaccine during the last, I think 6 years.

Reporter: Mainland...?

SFH: I think there are always outbreaks [in] chickens everywhere, every now
and then. We have not actually received any information from the Mainland.

Reporter: So, we won't have any fresh chicken immediately?

SFH: 21 days, I think it would be from now until after Christmas.

Reporter: (inaudible)

SFH: We cannot conclude with just the information we got so far. We are
investigating on various factors. As I mentioned earlier on, there are
quite a number of factors that could actually result in such an outbreak.

Reporter: (inaudible)

SFH: I think in May/April. Actually we have declared Hong Kong is in
"serious" state for 21 days, when we have a H5N1 virus in our market. Do
you remember that?

Reporter: ... infected chickens?

SFH: Since we have tested chickens from this farm last Friday [5 Dec 2008].
And after that, that batch of chickens was already gone into the market.
And I believe it was all sold by now. Any new development after that could
be only in a couple of days. So I don't think there is any delay in the
reporting of this farm incident.

Reporter: Financial tsunami...?

AFCD assistant director (inspection & quarantine) Dr Thomas Sit: I think we
are very unfortunate to start with. And these are not something related.
The risk of avian flu is always there in our environment. And I think we
have been always very vigilant in monitoring various biosecurity of our own
farms and also the imported poultry. So in this case, of course I am
concerned whether there is any extra factor that would affect us, and any
extra measure that we have to take in the future. Unless we have any new
information regarding the virus, and also the effectiveness of the
vaccination, otherwise, I think the existing measures are basically of the
international standards, and these are measures we need to continue. Apart
from the policy and the measures, we have to ensure that people comply with
them. We will try to investigate and see whether we can find a more
probable cause for this outbreak.

Reporter: ... sufficient vaccine in stock?

SFH: As we have always prepared for the arrival of a possible pandemic, we
have actually quite a sizeable stock of Tamiflu in the Department of Health
and it should be quite sufficient for our protection up to about 20 per
cent of our population. So for this particular incident, we don't worry
[about] the shortage of Tamiflu. We should have sufficient drugs and
medicines to look after anybody who might be exposed to avian flu.

Report[er]: What about the vaccine?

SFH: You mean avian flu vaccine for humans? No, I think it is still in a
very early experimental stage.

[The decision of the Hong Kong Government to declare a "serious alert
state" has been applied in line with the territory's "preparedness plan for
influenza pandemic". According to the said plan, there are 3 levels of the
response: Alert Response Level, Serious Response Level, and Emergency
Response Level. These levels are based on different risk-graded
epidemiological scenarios relevant to Hong Kong, and each of them
prescribes a given set of public health actions required. They are designed
to match with the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for pandemic
influenza planning. The full plan is available at

Hong Kong to cull chickens after detecting bird flu
---------------------------------------------------
Hong Kong health authorities said on Tuesday [9 Dec 2008] that they would
slaughter 80 000 chickens after 3 dead birds tested positive for the H5
avian flu virus. [These figures pertain to the number of samples sent to
the laboratory. For number of cases on the farm, see item 1 above. -
Mod.AS] The outbreak, Hong Kong's first in 6 years, raises fresh questions
about the city's efforts to prevent bird flu.

The news could also hit public sentiment as the financial center struggles
with the economic impact of the global slowdown. The city, a special
administrative region of China, fell into recession in the 3rd quarter, and
the city's leader warned this week that the territory faces a difficult 2009.

"Hong Kong is facing a new alert for bird flu," York Chow, Hong Kong's
secretary for food and health, said on Tuesday [9 Dec 2008] at a press
conference, according to the Associated Press. Mr Chow said the chickens
were found Monday [8 Dec 2008] on a farm with 60 000 birds that has since
been designated an infected zone. He added that Hong Kong would suspend
poultry imports for 21 days and begin slaughtering 80 000 birds.

Officials said they hadn't yet determined if the virus they found was the
H5N1 strain of bird flu that has proven deadly for humans. Still, the
outbreak raises questions about how birds at the farm were infected. Yi
Guan, a microbiologist and avian flu expert at Hong Kong University, said
Hong Kong has some of the highest safety standards in the region but warned
of "leaking holes" in the system. "We have a high-tech biosecurity system,"
Mr Guan said. "But how the farmer runs the farm is another story." Mr Guan
said it would take scientists "a couple of days" to determine the
particular strain of the virus, but warned that several strains within the
H5 family of viruses could pose threats to humans.

In June [2008], a routine inspection of an outdoor food market turned up 5
cases of avian influenza, spurring officials to slaughter chickens and
suspend supplies of live chickens from local and Mainland Chinese farms for
3 weeks. An investigation was launched to determine the source of that
outbreak, but a government spokeswoman said Tuesday [9 Dec 2008] that the
source of June's outbreak had "posed some difficulties" and wasn't yet
determined. So far, the disease's impact has been muted by its inability to
easily pass from human to human. Since 2003, it has infected 387 people in
15 countries, including China, Indonesia and Viet Nam, according to the
World Health Organization (WHO). Of those confirmed cases, 63 percent have
proved fatal. [The 9 Dec 2008 update of confirmed avian influenza A (H5N1)
human cases reported to WHO are 389 cases and 246 deaths; see
<http://www.info.gov.hk/info/flu/eng/global.htm>. - Mod.AS] Scientists
worry that the flu could mutate into a tougher and more contagious form.

Hong Kong has seen occasional bird-flu incidents but no major outbreaks
since 1997, when the virus killed 6 people and led to a slaughter of the
territory's 1.5 million birds. There are currently about 60 000 birds in
Hong Kong, according to Hong Kong's government, which is discouraging
vendors from selling live chickens.

The incident comes at a time of heightened scrutiny on food safety in the
region. Hong Kong officials have been scrutinizing the city's food supply
for signs of melamine, a toxic chemical that has been found in milk
products and eggs from the mainland. Mr Guan, the Hong Kong University
microbiologist, said now would be a good time to review current safety
standards. "After this event, we will go and check to see whether the
system is good or not, or if it can be improved," Mr Guan said. "I think
that will be the next topic to discuss."

[Hong Kong was the site of the very 1st case of human infection with HPAI
H5N1 in August 1997. Since then, the HK government has been applying the
following exemplary measures to reduce the risk of infection spreading from
poultry to humans:
a. vaccination of chickens in local farms and imported chickens;
b. regulation of local farms including tightened biosecurity measures (for
example, all farms should be [wild] bird proof);
c. import control (for instance, imported chickens must come from
registered farms with health certificates);
d. segregation policy (no waterfowl, which are natural carriers of avian
influenza viruses, can be sold in retail outlets);
e. market rest days to break the virus cycle and reduce the viral load;
f. hygiene requirements on wholesale market and retail outlets; and
g. surveillance targeted at humans, poultry and wild birds to ensure timely
detection of the presence of any avian influenza viruses in our environment.

The said measures and additional background information are described in
the document "Hong Kong's preparedness for influenza pandemic - Prevention
and Protection" updated July 2007, which is available at
<http://www.info.gov.hk/info/flu/eng/files/hkpippp.pdf>.

It is perfectly understandable that a seriously suspected HPAI (highly
pathogenic avian influenza) H5N1 on a commercial farm -- in spite of the
severe measures applied during several years -- will cause grave concern in
this densely populated territory, leading to severe control measures of
which the 1st one, namely stamping out, has promptly been decided upon and,
most probably, already applied.

The final identification of the causative agent is expected soon. - Mod.AS
