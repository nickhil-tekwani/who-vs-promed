The "eradication" [of yaws in PNG has long been known not to have been
longterm; for the last 12 years or so there have been regular accounts from
both PNG and Solomons of
the "reemergence"; see for instance:
Duncan, L. E. and W. Alto (1987). "An investigation of yaws on the
Trobriand Islands, 1985." Papua New Guinea Medical Journal 30(1): 57-61.
Eason, R. J. and T. Tasman-Jones (1985). "Resurgent yaws and other skin
diseases in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands." Papua New Guinea
Medical Journal 28(4): 247-50.

Guinea Medical Journal 29(3): 247-52.

New Guinea." Papua New Guinea Medical Journal 33(1): 59-65.

Yaws has been endemic in areas of PNG for years including Madang, New
Britian, Solomon Is, and Milne Bay Provinces. Reports of yaws in Milne Bay
go back to 1935 when 54 cases were reported from Samarai Is. Mass treatment
campaigns in the 1950s were unable to reach are areas of the colony, some
areas had not yet been explored. Yaws became a reportable disease in 1969.
One case was reported from Milne Bay between 1974 to 1979. The disease
was probably kept in check by the practice of treating respiratory
infections and otitis media with daily doses of injectable penicillin. In
the mid 1980s a resurgence of yaws was reported from Kar Kar Is (Madang)
and N. Kiriwina Is (Milne Bay). With the recent decline in rural health
services it is no surprise that the disease is again being seen with some
frequency in other areas of the country.

Having spent some time in PNG working with yaws, allow me to correct some
of the statements quoted from the PNG paper the National. Foremost there is
some confusion between the mode of transmission of Treponema pallidum subsp
pertenue, the causative organism of yaws and T. pallidum subsp pallidum the
causative organism of venereal syphilis.
Yaws is commonly a disease of childhood; children of 2-15 years being the
reservoir for infection. Infection being nonvenereal, through abrasions
coming in direct contact with the exudate of early yaws lesions which is
teeming with treponemes. It is not considered to be a fatal disease,
however, ulceration and secondary infection by other bacteria does occur.
Vertical transmission through the mother at birth occurs with T. pallidum
sub sp pallidum (congenital syphilis) however this is not so with T.
pallidum subsp pertenue. In fact, neonates and young infants, who are often
carried in bilums for up to 4 years of age, are rarely seen with yaws. It
is when they hit the ground in bare feet so to speak that the potential for
infection arises.
Yaws affects skin, cartilage and bone. Neurological complications arising
from yaws have not been documented and certainly not blindness. The late
complications are more tissue destruction which can lead to gross facial
disfiguration (gangosa), loss of toes and foot deformity as result of
ulceration and osteoperiostitis and finally bowing of the tibia (sabre
tibia) also from osteoperiostitis.
All pathogenic treponemes are sensitive to penicillin which must be long
acting or administered over a long period to maintain a treponemicidal
level in the blood. However, as yaws is capable of periods of latency
followed by relapse with infectious lesions, treatment should be aimed at
controlling the spread of the disease. Therefore not only the patient
should receive treatment, but at least family and other close contacts.
