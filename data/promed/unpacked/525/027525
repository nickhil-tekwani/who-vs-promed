Death toll of the Ebola virus disease in Sierra Leone has risen to 6 out of 33 confirmed cases, the Health Ministry said Friday [6 Jun 2014]. "The increase shows that the surveillance as well as the case search is active as for every confirmed case of Ebola," said Idrissu Tunis, Director of Information and Communication in the Ministry of Health, to the press. "We have to do contact tracing, checking all the people that had come in contact with a confirmed case victim to ascertain whether they are positive or negative," said Tunis.

During the case search and contact tracing, the number of suspected cases is expected to increase, he noted. "So far, all these confirmed cases are linked to the index case, i.e. the very 1st confirmed case we received from the Kissi Teng area [Kailahun District, Eastern Province]," he said. "What we are seeing now in the Kissi Teng region is that people still don't believe that the Ebola virus disease exists. We are still finding it difficult to convince them, and they are reluctant to accept health workers. The defiance is making our job difficult, but we met Wednesday [4 Jun 2014] with traditional leaders and the secret society," he added.

According to Tunis, most of the confirmed cases are women, as they demonstrate defiance and refuse to cooperate with the health staff.

Sierra Leone
------------
West African governments have been trying to bring a killer disease to heel, but sadly with little success. The Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak in the region saw an alarming surge at the end of last month [May 2014], with 37 new cases and 21 deaths reported in Guinea between [29 May 2014] and [1 Jun 2014], says the World Health Organization.

Sierra Leone also reported 13 new cases, of which 3 have been confirmed.

The ebolavirus is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, and the virus can be transmitted even after that person dies. Health workers said families moving bodies for funerals have been a factor in the spread of the disease.

The scourge is troublingly persistent, and a threat not only to locals' health, but also, indirectly, to their livelihood. Bloomberg reports that UK companies with mines in Sierra Leone have seen their stock fall as they put travel restrictions in place for their [expatriate] workers. The mines have not shut down operations as of yet, but are screening [local] workers in order to detect signs of fever.

Guinea
------
Even as Guinea suffers, there has been some welcome news for its economy. The country is slated to be the site of a massive mining project that could double its GDP, and the plan is now proceeding after long delays; see: http://www.miningweekly.com/article/guinea-signs-framework-deal-with-rio-chinalco-for-20bn-project-2014-05-26.

However, it's not hard to imagine that a future disease outbreak, of EVD or some other epidemic, could cause serious setbacks for this endeavor. It's important to remember that disease control in developing countries smoothes the way for foreign investment, and for changes in economic fortune.

[Although the majority of victims of EVD have been women, due to their exposure to the virus as caregivers for the sick in the home and washers of the bodies of their dead relatives, they are reported to be the most defiant of health workers' attempts to hospitalize EVD patients, often far from their home village, and to restrict moving their dead across borders and their performance of traditional burial practices.

Therefore, I suppose that among the many secret societies in Sierra Leone, the one referred to is the women's Bondo Secret Society. For a detailed explanation about it by a local author in August 2013, see: http://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/archives/59854. It includes the following passage:

"The Minister of Social Welfare Gender and Children's Affairs, Moijue Kaikai, recently [2013] said that 'Our traditions must be respected and the government will not interfere in secret societal matters as long as they do not pose a threat to national security or infringe on the rights of anyone without due cause.'"

There is a recent CDC map of the affected areas in the 3 countries (Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia) at: http://blogs.plos.org/thestudentblog/files/2014/06/GuineaSLeone-map-060214.jpg. - Mod.JW]
