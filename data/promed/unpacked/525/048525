An exotic mosquito that has the potential to spread deadly diseases has been detected in north Queensland. The adult Asian tiger mosquito [_Aedes albopictus_] was collected in a routine monitoring trap at Cairns port late last week [week of 10 Aug 2015] and is believed to have arrived on an international vessel.

The Asian tiger mosquito can bite dozens of times a minute. It is capable of spreading diseases such as chikungunya virus, Ross River virus, dengue, and yellow fever [viruses].

Although it is yet to establish itself on the mainland, populations have existed in the Torres Strait Islands for about a decade.

Mosquito researcher Nigel Beebe said the tiger mosquito was making a "world domination" move. "We don't want that thing here; we are trying very hard to keep it out," he said on [Tue 18 Aug 2015]. "Modelling has suggested it will go as far as Melbourne and Adelaide. We call it the barbecue buster and people will really dislike it because it will hammer them."

Authorities acted swiftly to kill any other adult mosquitoes that may have entered Cairns port.

A Department of Agriculture spokeswoman said potential breeding and resting sites had been treated with a residual insecticide and fogging had been undertaken.

Additional mosquito traps had been deployed and were being monitored daily. "There have been no further Asian tiger mosquitoes detected," the spokeswoman said.

[One hopes that the surveillance and control measures have eliminated these vector mosquitoes in Cairns. This is another example of the relative ease that vector mosquitoes can move long distances, with the risk of becoming established if not detected and eliminated very quickly. This situation also illustrates the value of ongoing monitoring in localities where the risk of introduction is significant.

Interestingly, Asian tiger mosquitoes [_Aedes albopictus_] were detected in the Northern Territories and in traps at East Arm Wharf in August and December 2013, and at Toll Marine Logistics dock in August 2013. The 1st batch of mosquitoes were thought to have arrived on an international cargo ship 22 Apr 2013. _Aedes aegypti_ has also been introduced into Australia, most recently 3 times by aircraft in the Melbourne, Victoria airport, but good surveillance and control by the Australian Department of Agriculture detected and eliminated them.

According to the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, this is not the 1st time that this type of mosquito [_Aedes albopictus_] has been detected in Belgium. The mosquito was seen in a facility in late June [2015].

The tiger mosquito was seen in a single place and very few have been identified. The Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp spoke to our colleagues of "Le Soir" newspaper, "They are for the moment in a closed space and no one has been infected. We are monitoring regularly and we have found nothing. These mosquitoes are therefore not scattered and the risk of infection is minimal."

However, if infection occurs, Belgium has no action plan. "Unlike the Netherlands, we are not prepared. The Institute is not trained for this possible situation. We are just scientists. Currently, it is the Regions that manage the situation, but a national plan [extensive surveillance and control] is needed."

There is a product to eradicate the mosquito, but its use in Belgium is illegal. "The government has applied to the European Community for permission to use it. We are still awaiting a response."

The tiger mosquito can transmit dengue [virus] (causing rash, headache, fatigue ...) and chikungunya [virus] (causing "break bone fever" [this term usually applies to dengue fever. Chikungunya virus infections usually cause acute and sometime persistent joint pain. - Mod.TY])

[This is the 1st report of the presence of _Aedes albopictus_ in Belgium that ProMED-mail has posted. The report does not provide details about the number of individuals or egg rafts, larvae, or pupae of _Aedes albopictus_ were detected, nor specifically where and when. As long as the weather remains warm, rapid reproduction can occur if these mosquitoes are not promptly eliminated. Unless the strain of _Ae. albopictus_ there can undergo diapause (suspension of development), they should be eliminated by the 1st killing frosts. As the report above indicates, a plan for surveillance and control is needed.

A map of the current distribution of _Ae. albopictus_ in Europe can be accessed at http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/vectors/vector-maps/Pages/VBORNET_maps.aspx.
