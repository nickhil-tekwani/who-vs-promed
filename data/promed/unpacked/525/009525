The initial findings of an investigation into the recent deaths of 25 wild water buffaloes in Yangmingshan National Park in Taipei indicate that the animals were victims of malnutrition, the spokesman for the park headquarters said on Monday [21 Dec 2020].

At a meeting of experts held by the Taipei City Animal Protection Office earlier in the day to discuss the issue, contagious diseases, pesticides, and fences on the mountains were ruled out as causes of death. A "composite environmental factor" was blamed, the spokesman said, noting that the experts agreed according to preliminary indications that the deaths were associated with insufficient nutrition in the food sources of the breeding sites of the wild water buffaloes.

"Some cattle died of long-term malnutrition," Chang said, explaining that while there was an abundance of grasses in the area, they lacked protein and minerals. The water buffaloes could still be malnourished even when they had enough grass to eat, particularly on rainy days when minerals, known as trace elements, were easily washed off, he said.

The experts made their determination based on autopsies of some of the water buffaloes that died. They suggested that park headquarters put salt bricks and dried grass at 2 locations -- the Qingtiangang Grassland and the Dingshan-Shitiling area -- where the animals usually congregate, as an emergency response measure, Chang said. Over the longer term, the headquarters will increase checks of the animals by park rangers and have veterinarians collect samples if anything unusual related to their health is detected, he said.

According to statistics released by the park headquarters in September, there were a total of 94 wild water buffaloes in the national park. As of 20 Dec 2020, 25 had been found dead, headquarters data showed.

[If the primary cause of these deaths was a shortage in food quantity/quality, one would not expect a pattern of mass mortality over a short period of time, but instead occurrence of few deaths per time unit for a relatively long period.

Soay sheep in the Saint Kilda archipelago, Scotland, experience multiannual cycles with periodic mass mortalities of up to 50% of the population. The proximate cause of death has been determined to be protein-energy malnutrition associated with harsh winters (nutritional stress), but parasites have been implicated as a key contributing factor. An experimental study showed that the administration of anthelminthic drugs at the time of the population crash considerably reduced mortality, which supported the link between parasites and death. Environmental stress appears to mediate the increase in parasite burdens observed in Soays, interacting with food shortage to influence survival.

A deteriorated condition may trigger vicious circles where host health becomes increasingly impoverished and severe infection generally more likely, which might eventually lead to death, as observed in Soay sheep. There is a clear potential for synergy between infection and condition: poor condition predisposes to host infections, which further reduce condition, and so on (for a review on the subject see https://bibliotecavirtual.unl.edu.ar/publicaciones/index.php/FAVEveterinaria/article/view/5160). It would be interesting to deepen the investigation of this event so that it could be established how the detected nutritional stress interacted with the other elements of the host-stress-parasite interaction. - Mod.PMB
