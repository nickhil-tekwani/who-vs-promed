Ecuador has recorded 1460 cases of dengue thus far in 2006, of which 1430 are
of the classic dengue and 30 [hemorrhagic type], which caused the death of 2
patients, the minister of Health, Iv Zambrano, announced Thursday.�
He also indicated that the sanitary authorities were investigating 17 other
probable cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF], a viral disease transmitted
by a mosquito that breeds in winter.�
A month ago, the Zambrano [the local newspaper?] reported that 5 people died
because of meningitis and dengue hemorrhagic fever. At that time, a civil
employee indicated that there were 561 cases of classic dengue and 23 of DHF.
The previous Ecuadorian minister of Health, Wellington Sanchez, warned in June
[2005] that about 850 000 Ecuadorians ran the risk of contracting hemorrhagic
dengue. "We have a very high population, nearly 850 000 people, on the coast,
who have had classic dengue in previous years, and that puts them in danger of
contracting [hemorrhagic dengue]," he stated.

Health Department head Stanley Hanson of DSDS sought yesterday to allay fears
of a fresh outbreak of dengue fever on the French side (St. Martin) amid new
cases reported. He reassured the public that the handling of dengue cases was
still at a stable and manageable level.
"2-3 cases of dengue fever are reported on average every week, but that does
not mean we have an epidemic on our hands," said Hanson. "Some weeks we have
no cases reported. It is still at a manageable level, but we have to be
constantly vigilant."
The most recent case was reported in Mont Vernon, French Cul-de-Sac, last
Thursday [2 Mar 2006?]. Hanson did not have the total number of cases reported
for this year at hand due to the public holiday, but said that whenever a case
was reported, the area where it originated was vigorously checked over and the
area sprayed.
Currently all cases of dengue fever on file in St. Martin are those of the
basic non-life-threatening type called primary dengue [normally referred to as
classic dengue]. There are no cases of the more severe and often fatal form
called dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in St. Martin, though there are cases in
Guadeloupe and Martinique [neighboring French Caribbean islands].
"I cannot say the hemorrhagic type will not reach St. Martin, but in
Guadeloupe and Martinique they are doing everything possible to contain it
there," he said. "They are spraying the aircraft coming to St. Martin and that
appears to be working well so far." DSDS will be carrying out spraying today
in the areas of Orient Bay, Orient Bay Park and Mont Vernon, between 5:30pm
and 7:00pm.
DSDS urges the public to eliminate the places where mosquitoes lay eggs,
usually in artificial containers of stagnant water such as car tyres, 55-
gallon drums and buckets. Items that are used to collect or store rainwater
should be discarded. Pet and animal watering containers and vases with fresh
flowers should all be emptied and cleaned once a week to eliminate possible
eggs and larvae. DSDS also recommends regular use of mosquito repellent and
creams.
Dengue fever is caused by any one of 4 closely related viruses -- DEN 1-4 --
and is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito. It is estimated there are 100 million cases of dengue worldwide each
year. Dengue cannot be spread directly from person to person. There is no
specific medication for treatment of a dengue infection.

Chikungunya and dengue viruses were detected for the first time simultaneously
in 15 patients on Reunion. If the co-infection is confirmed, it will have to
be determined whether the patients were infected by mosquitoes transporting
both viruses or if the infections were separate, as was announced today in an
official statement by the Regional Administration of Sanitary and Social
Affairs (DRASS).
Chikungunya and dengue are transmitted by the same mosquito, the famous _Aedes
albopictus_.
The cases remain to be confirmed by the national Center [for Arboviruses] of
Lyon. The situation is far from being clear. According to Doctor Henriette de
Valk, member of the Interregional Epidemiology Cell of Reunion-Mayotte
(CIRE) "Chikungunya infection can influence the results of dengue tests."
[She can't have said that, it's absolutely untrue. CHIKV is an alphavirus,
the 4 dengue viruses are flaviviruses. There is zero crossing between them in
lab tests. - Mod.JW, former head of CDC's dengue lab in the Caribbean].
According to CIRE, "the occurrence of isolated cases of dengue is comparable
with the background noise observed in 2005" on Reunion, where on average 2
cases of dengue were recorded per month. The last epidemic of dengue on the
island in 2004 infected several hundred people.
The epidemic of "Chik" has affected 157 000 people since March 2005.
At the highest levels of French government, the new risks of the epidemic are
regarded as extremely alarming. At a Council of Ministers this morning Jacques
Chirac called for adaptating the alarm and monitoring system "vis-a-vis
emergent infectious diseases."

The Centre for Health Protection has confirmed a Dengue fever case involving a
48-year-old woman living in Sheung Shui, bringing the year's total cases to 4,
all imported.
The patient travelled to Thailand 27-30 Jan 2006, and got a fever, headache, a
rash, and joint and muscle pain on 4 Feb 2006. She was admitted to North
District Hospital on 9 Feb and was discharged 15 Feb 2006. Her home contacts
have no symptoms. [Dengue is not transmitted person-to-person. - Mod.JW]

20 southern provinces and cities have reported dengue epidemics with around
400 patients hospitalized by 26 Feb 2006, reported the Ministry of Health.
The provinces with the highest numbers of dengue patients are HCM [Ho Chi
Minh] City 57, Soc Trang 27, Dong Thap 32, Da Nang 17 and Can Tho 11. Doctors
have warned of dengue pandemics in the south. The HCM City Pasteur Institute
in late 2005 warned of dengue epidemics in many southern provinces in early
2006.
Last year [2005] more than 44 000 cases of dengue were recorded in the
southern region, and 47 died [a case fatality ratio of 107 per 100 000 for the
southern region]. Dong Thap Province had the highest number of dengue cases,
6658, followed by HCM City with 6254 and An Giang with 2854.
Vietnam has recorded over 4800 dengue cases so far this year [2006]; 2 died
[CFR of 42 per 100 000], an increase of nearly 20 percent year on year,
according to the Ministry of Health.

Vietnam has so far in 2006 detected 4800 cases of dengue fever infection,
including 2 deaths, a year-on-year rise of 20 percent, according to a local
health agency on Monday.
The cases were detected in 20 cities and provinces nationwide, but most of
them are in southern Ho Chi Minh City, and the southern provinces of Soc
Trang, Dong Thap and Dong Nai, where weather conditions and local people's
habit of storing water in containers near their houses favor the development
of mosquitoes -- the disease's transmitter, said the Preventive Medicine
Department under the Health Ministry.
To minimize the number of new infections, local health workers are encouraging
residents to kill mosquitoes and their larvae more actively.
Vietnam reported 49 400 cases of dengue fever infections including 51
fatalities last year [2005] [CFR of 103 per 100 000 for nationwide], down 32.7
percent and 49.5 percent from the previous years [2003-2004], respectively,
according to the country's General Statistics Office.

[Note that report [5] above says:
"Last year [2005] more than 44 000 cases of dengue were recorded in the
southern region, and 47 died [a case fatality ratio of 107 per 100 000 for the
southern region]."
& this report [6] says:
"Vietnam reported 49 400 cases of dengue fever infections including 51
fatalities last year [2005] [CFR of 103 per 100 000 for nationwide]."
meaning the vast majority of cases and deaths occurred in the south.
