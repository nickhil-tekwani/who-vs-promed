One cause of cutaneous infections in people handling seal products is
_Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae_, the cause of "erysipelas" in animals and
"erysipeloid" in humans. This bacterium has a wide mammalian host range, but
also should be readily cultured and identified in infected mink tissues by
routine techniques.
