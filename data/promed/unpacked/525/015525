Many People Die of Cholera-like Disease in Afghanistan
------------------------------------------------------
Many people, most of them children aging from 6 months to 2 years, have
died of a cholera-like disease in central Afghanistan, the Associated Press
of Pakistan (APP) reported. Relief agencies were quoted as saying Friday
that the disease, which has
symptoms like those of cholera, has killed many people, most of them
children, in Samangan and Bamyan provinces.
Experts said the disease might be the result of eating poisonous plants due
to lack of food material in the area.
An official of an aid agency in central Afghanistan said that during the
last one and a half month, over 27 children had died in Darra-e-Suf. He
said the local people described the disease as "cholera" which caused water
in the bodies of the victims to vanish rapidly.
