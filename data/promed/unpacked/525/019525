Producers warned of Three Day Sickness threat
---------------------------------------------
The Department of Primary Industries is warning graziers in the New
England and north-west New South Wales their cattle could be under
threat from Three Day Sickness. The big rise in mosquito numbers in
the region after good rain early in the year has prompted the fears,
along with outbreaks of the disease in the Moree district.

The department's district veterinarian, Shaun Slattery, says Bovine
Ephemeral Fever is typified by depression, fever, lameness and
stringing drools from the mouths of affected cattle.

"We have the situation in the Moree and Narrabri districts where it's
been some years since we've had an outbreak of Three Day Sickness, so
those herds are going to be relatively naive. There'll be no immunity
and the disease could possibly spread to them quickly," he said.

[Bovine ephemeral fever is caused by the bovine ephemeral fever virus
(BEFV), a member of the genus _Ephemerovirus_ in the family
Rhabdoviridae. There is only one serotype. Other members of this
genus (Adelaide River virus, Kimberley virus, Berrimah virus, Puchong
virus and Malakal virus) can cross-react in some serological tests.

Bovine ephemeral fever appears to be transmitted by arthropods. The
vector or vectors are not known, but BEFV has been isolated from a
mixed pool of Culicine and Anopheline mosquitoes, as well as
_Anopheles bancroftii_, in Australia, and from _Culicoides_ (biting
midges) in both Africa and Australia. Mosquitoes are suspected to be
the most important biological vectors. The disease can also be spread
by intravenous inoculation of small amounts of blood. Bovine
ephemeral fever is not transmitted by close contact, body secretions,
or aerosol droplets. The virus does not seem to be transmitted in
semen and it is rapidly inactivated in meat. Carriers are not known to occur.

In experimental infections, the incubation period is 1 to 10 days,
with most cases developing between 3 and 5 days after exposure. The
natural incubation period is probably similar.

Bovine ephemeral can be either mild or severe in cattle, with the
most severe cases occurring in bulls and high-producing cows. The
signs vary in individual animals, but the classic course begins with
a fever, which is often biphasic, triphasic or polyphasic and
generally peaks occur 12 to 18 hours apart. During the 1st fever
spike, milk production in lactating cows often drops dramatically,
but other clinical signs tend to be mild. On the 2nd day of illness,
which may coincide with a 2nd elevation in temperature, the signs are
more severe. Animals usually become inappetent and depressed, with an
increased heart rate, tachypnea, and serous or mucoid discharges from
the nose. Profuse salivation, muscle twitching, waves of shivering or
a watery ocular discharge may also be seen.

Some animals develop submandibular or periorbital edema, and shifting
lameness. The lameness can be severe enough to mimic a fracture or
dislocation. Pulmonary emphysema and rales may be found in severe
cases. Many animals, particularly cows in good condition and bulls,
become recumbent for 8 hours to days. Most animals temporarily lose
their reflexes and are unable to rise. Recumbent animals may be
bloated, have ruminal stasis, or lose their swallowing reflex. These
clinical signs can be exacerbated by severe environmental stress or
forced exercise.

Most animals begin to improve a day or 2 after the 1st symptoms
appear, and recover completely within another one to 2 days. [Hence
the name, three day fever - Mod.TG] Lactating cows and animals in
good condition are usually affected more severely and may take up to
a week to recover. Generally, animals lose condition rapidly during
the illness, and regain their weight only slowly. Deaths are usually
the result of secondary complications such as pneumonia or trauma.

Water buffalo have similar signs, but the disease is usually milder.
Experimentally infected sheep remain asymptomatic.
