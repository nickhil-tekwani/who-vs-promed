[Re ProMED post Chikungunya - Italy (Emilia Romagna): susp. 20070901.2877]
Your latest post concerning a suspected outbreak
of chikungunya fever in Italy (Emilia Romagna)
appears to be confirmed by a note dispatched by
Ministry of Health [see Source above]. A paragraph in this document reads:
''I risultati degli esami di laboratorio eseguiti
dal Dipartimento di malattie infettive dellâ€™Iss
su campioni biologici delle persone colpite,
indicano invece come causa del focolaio epidemico il virus Chikungunya.''
(Laboratory test analysis on patients' samples
indicate causative agent of this illness is
chikungunya virus. - My translation.)
Whether an infected traveler is to blame for the
outbreak or a persistent presence of the virus in
the mosquito population remains to be
established. [See comment below. - Mod. JW]

Note that "chikungunya" takes a lower-case
initial inside a sentence, just like "dengue",
because the word describes a symptom (joint pain in both cases).
The reference to persistence in mosquitoes refers
to the importation of a number of cases last year
(2006), in travelers returning from epidemic
areas in the Indian Ocean islands & India, which
could have infected local mosquitoes, although no
local epidemic was recognized at the
time. ProMED archive Chikungunya - Indian Ocean
update (09): islands, India 20060320.0864, March
2006, mentions the importations into Italy &
other European countries. A just published paper
kindly forwarded by ProMED Moderator Emeritus Charlie Calisher is:

infection, Italy [letter]. Emerg Infect Dis
[serial on the Internet]. 2007 Aug. Available
from <http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/13/8/1264.htm>
Since dengue is also spread by the same vector
species of mosquito as chikungunya, clearly Italy
is now wide open for imported cases of dengue to
start an epidemic. It is hoped that the relevant
authorities there have taken note of the risk. - Mod.JW]
