The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has confirmed the
occurrence of equine piroplasmosis in a number of thoroughbred horses
in an equine facility in county Meath. The stud is believed to be a
high profile stable in the south Meath area.

Piroplasmosis is a tick-borne protozoan disease of horses, mules,
donkeys and zebras. It is caused by blood parasites, _Theleria equi_
and _Babesia caballi_, and gives rise to anaemia and jaundice in
affected animals. The disease is not readily contagious and has no
zoonotic implications and, therefore, no public health concerns arise.

A notifiable disease in Ireland since July 2009, it has not been
officially reported in this country before, although it is understood
that a previous incursion did take place. The disease is present in
Mediterranean countries but is not present in the US, Canada, the UK
or Australia.

The facility in question has been served with a movement restriction
notice, and epidemiological investigations are underway to establish
the origin of the disease and the extent of the spread, if any, to
other locations.

The Department has been in contact with industry representatives who
have been informed of the situation. A meeting with industry
representatives has been arranged to discuss the implications for
animal movement and the measures appropriate to address the threat
posed by the disease.

[Those familiar with the Irish scene are well aware of the serious
impact any infectious or contagious equine disease will have upon the
locals and the media, particularly if there are possible implications
related to horse movements, intra- and internationally.

Ireland has notified the OIE about this outbreak, diagnosed as
_Theileria equi_. The immediate notification is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8418>.
It indicates the start date to be 10 Jun 2009, the date of 1st
confirmation of the event as 17 Jul 2009, and the report date as 8
Sep 2009. The report includes a map and the following epidemiological comments:

"The competent authority was notified of positive laboratory results
in 3 horses on 2 Sep 2009. The clinical signs seen in June [2009]
were fever, anaemia and poor performance. Further sampling of all
animals in the stable showed 28 of 60 positive on ELISA dated 7 Sep 2009."

For background and diagnostic methods, see chapter 2.5.8. "Equine
piroplasmosis" in OIE's Terrestrial manual at
