The most recent analyses done by experts of the Public Health Institute
show that the microorganism [microalga] contaminated four shellfish
grow-out rafts on the coast of Antofagasta .
Health authorities have maintained a strict and continuous epidemiological
surveillance of the coasts of the First and Second Regions because of the
presence of a type of red tide that has already caused severe diarrhea in
more than 400 persons.
Thus far, experts of the Public Health Institute (PHI) have detected the
presence of a diarrhea producing toxin [produced by] the microalga,
_Dinophysus acuta_, only in the northern coast of the Second Region and in
the southern zone of the First Region, specifically in Iquiqe. Some time
today, they will obtain the results of samples taken off the coast to the
south of Antofagasta.
The most recent analysis, performed during the weekend by scientists of the
PHI, the maritime department, and the National Fisheries Service,
demonstrated the diarrhea-producing toxin contaminated four grow-out rafts
of bivalves on the northern coast of Antofagasta. The areas affected
include Santa Maria Island, Hornito, La Chimba and Rinconada.
Illegal Sales. The Minister of Health, Alex Figueroa, maintained that the
severity of the symptoms caused by the diarrhea-producing toxin "clearly
justifies the prohibition of the harvest and sale of shellfish in the
area." Notwithstanding, since the embargo was announced on Friday, 50 new
cases have appeared which have raised the number of poisonings to 321 in
the Second Region.
"We know that some fishermen are selling shellfish illegally, which is
worrisome. We will take action to severely punish those who do not comply
with the law, particularly because we do not yet know if there are other
complications of the disease" stated Dr. Manuel Zamorano, Director of the
Health Service of Antofagasta.
The First Region. In Iquique, 60 people were poisoned during the weekend.
Most were police officials who attended a an annual celebratory dinner for
their organization. The latter had dinner Saturday night in a downtown
restaurant where they ate seafood in mayonnaise, meat, and cake. The next
day, a large group of them had painful gastroenteritis. Another group was
poisoned at a family party where they ate a large number of raw and cooked
shellfish.
Health officials began an epidemiological investigation and based on the
case histories of the above groups, they were able to rule out toxins in
the coves of Chipana and San Marcos, since the last samples taken have been
negative.
The Director of the Program for the Environment of the First Region, Dr.
Francisco Kushel, said that there was concern about the confirmed presence
of red tide in the Second Region, because of which they would maintain
epidemiological surveillance.
In Santiago, Minister Alex Figueroa called for calm in the Metropolitan
Region among those who buy seafood in the fish market. "This does not
affect the products sold in the Santiago fish market, because these
products come from the south in areas where there is no red tide and where
health controls are extraordinarily strict."
Manuela Pinto of the Biology Department of the University of Tarapaca,
explained that a red tide can bring with it two kinds of toxins. The
first, which causes diarrhea, is present in the northern area. The second,
the paralytic toxin that can cause death, is found particularly in the
extreme south.
Peruvian officials began to survey the beaches of the southern part of the
country, especially the coast of Tacna, on the frontier with Chile, for the
presence of red tide, one of the collateral effects of the El Nino
phenomenon. Their observations will determine if they need to adopt
emergency measures.
