The parasite responsible for the oyster mortality reported is _Marteilia
sydneyi_, the causative agent of QX disease and is a protozoan
(_Paramyxea_) pathogen of the commercial rock oyster in Australia
(_Saccostrea commercialis_).
_M. sydneyi_ has been causing mortality in oysters in culture in southern
Queensland and northern New South Wales for decades, and is managed when
possible by moving oysters from susceptible sites (leases in brackish,
estuarine areas) to QX-free sites (more marine sandy environments) during
that period of the year when oysters are likely to become infected
(December to May - southern hemisphere summer). In northern New South
Wales, the dynamics of QX disease has been obscured by the presence of low
pH pulses of water in estuaries derived from leaching of acid sulphate
soils, a phenomenon exacerbated by intensive agriculture. The article
implies that there is a link between QX disease outbreaks and pH but our
research has shown definitively that no change in environmental pH is
required to produce an outbreak of QX disease in oysters. However, we
concede that water quality (including less than optimal pH) may have a
significant impact on the immunocompetence of oysters, and result in
increased susceptibility/mortality in affected populations of oysters.
The fisheries officer (Andy Derwent) quoted in the article then alluded to
the results of research I conducted in the Georges River, in Sydney during
a severe epizootic of _M. sydneyi_ between 1994 and 1996. We found a
limited duration or 'window' of initial infection of oysters which occurred
in late January/early February in that estuary. New oyster stock introduced
into the estuary after that period was not affected by the disease even
though local stock would begin to show reduced growth, loss of condition
and finally death within a few months of infection.
