A mysterious disease that killed 7 people in the Faridpur district in March
last broke out again claiming 5 more lives in the 2 days leading up to the

[The World Health Organization update on the outbreak of henipavirus
related encephalitis in Bangladesh earlier this year said that infections
had occurred in 5 districts: Rajbari, Manikganj, Jaipurhat, Naogang, and
Faridpur. As the above newswire describes an event in Faridpur, I suspect
that this may be a recurrence of nipahvirus activity in the district. More
information from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
