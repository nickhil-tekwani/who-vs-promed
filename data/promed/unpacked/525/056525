[With the gradual reduction of HFMD cases and the last fatality occurring
in the first week of July, the Taiwan health authorities ordered the
re-opening of swimming pool and summer camps in the later part of July. In
the face of this calm, three fatalities occurred in a span of four days in
three separate parts of the Island - north, central and south. The primary
source of this news was carried in the Health Page of Min Sheng Daily (in
Chinese) on 13th & 14th August
13/8/98 Announcement of two cases of recent fatalities from
hand-foot-and-mouth disease by the Department of Health was accompanied by
assurance that this was the tail-end of the epidemic and it would be
unlikely that swimming pools and summer camps would be closed again. The
first of two fatalities involved a one-year-old boy in Taipeh who started
receiving medical attention on 6th August for complaints of fever and rash.
His condition was diagnosed as HFMD. On 7th August he was brought to the
emergency department of City Women and Children Hospital because of
somnolence and mental disorientation. His condition subsequently
deteriorated rapidly with pulmonary edema, tachycardia and other signs. He
died on the 9th August.
Changhua's [City} case was a 4-year old boy who had fever and vesicular
lesions on 8th Aug. Consultation with a doctor indicated HFMD. On 10th
August, he was taken to the emergency department of Changhua Christian
Hospital with complaints of vomiting, but was not admitted because of good
mental condition. Unexpectedly, he suddenly became breathless on the
previous night [11th August and was admitted to Chang Ji Hospital, where
he was found to be hemiplegic on the right side, tachypneic with signs of
pulmonary edema. He subsequently died on 12th August. The Deputy Chief of
the Bureau of Communicable Disease, S.M. Hsu pointed out that there were
still 11 children hospitalized for suspected enterovirus infection, the
majority of whom had been old cases with onset falling before June. This
indicated that the enterovirus epidemic was definitely mellowing from the
peak of May and June. However before the weather turned cool, a few
isolated cases might still appear. Experts had already warned that the tail
end of the epidemic might drag itself over a long period of time. She
assured the public that while they should still stay vigilant, parents need
not be overly anxious. She urged a high standard of personal hygiene,
especially over eating utensils and baby feeding bottles, also to avoid
taking children under 5 to public and crowded places. As for older healthy
children, there was not need to limit their activities.
14/8/98 A 11-month old female infant died HFMD in Chiayi [south part of
Taiwan on early morning yesterday. According to the baby's family, she was
first diagnosed as having HFMD 5 days' ago. On midnight of 12 August, she
had fallen very ill with fever and vomiting. The parents first brought her
to a Chinese physician to be treated with herbal medicine, but because of
non-response, then brought her at 2 am to Kia Ji Hospital. The pediatrician
of the Hospital, Dr. J.Y. Hew, indicated that at the time of admission, the
infant was already comatose with a dusky face [cyanosis. She was also
febrile with vomiting. Vesicles on the hands and feet as well as those in
the mouth plus mouth ulceration made for the diagnosis of HFMD. Because of
the seriousness of her condition, the patient was admitted to the pediatric
intensive care unit, but died at 4:51 AM.
