[As usual, ProMED would like to know the name of the source country
and the strain of cholera involved. There is no danger to travelers to
Singapore, since that country has excellent sanitation. - Mod.JW]
[As noted above, the details of this imported case in Singapore are not
available at this time. Cases of imported cholera in Asia are often
associated with countries in the area with endemic cholera. As an
example, in the first 8 months of 2002 in Japan, 85 percent of the 28
cases of cholera diagnosed there were imported, with the countries of
origin reported to be the Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia and China.
