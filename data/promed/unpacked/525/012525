Thousands of leopard sharks and other marine life including rays, striped bass, and smooth-hound sharks have been dying in the San Francisco Bay.

The findings, revealed in an NBC Bay Area Investigative Unit report, suggest that up to 2000 leopard sharks have died in the San Francisco Bay of the last few months.

Dr Mark Okihiro, a researcher with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, told NBC that the pathogen can affect a range of different species, killing species such as bat rays, striped bass, smooth-hound sharks and halibut.

Researchers say that the deaths may be due to a parasite called _Miamiensis avidus_. The parasite -- a small, single-celled organism -- enters via the nose and eats at the brain slowly.

While the parasite is deadly to sharks and other marine animals, it is unlikely that humans who swim in the bay or who eat infected animals will become infected themselves.

Dr Okihiro says he performs necropsies on dead, stranded sharks along the bay, along with researchers at UC [University of California] San Francisco, to analyze the parasite DNA in 3 sharks.

As the parasite slowly eats away that the brain, it causes the sharks to swim in circles or beach themselves, says Dr Okihiro.

Between February and July of 2017, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife estimates that 1000-2000 leopard sharks died in the San Francisco Bay.

However, because sharks are not buoyant and tend to sink when they're not swimming, many dead sharks may sink to the sea floor and never wash up on the shore.

As such, Dr Okihiro says that leopard shark deaths may be higher than current estimates.

Dr Andrew Nosal, a marine biologist at UC San Diego, told NBC that it's important to determine what is killing the sharks because the deaths could start occurring down the coast of California.

In addition, the death of leopard sharks may have a knock-on effect on the ecosystem.

While it is not Dr Okihiro's job to research why the sharks are dying, he has been researching them in his own time, performing necropsies in his kitchen living room and patio.

He says that more resources are needed to study the matter, however, funds are limited at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Gabe Tiffany, Deputy Director of Administration at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, told NBC that the department has constraints on how its programs are funded.

Leopard sharks aren't threatened or endangered, and the department is not allocating any funds towards finding the cause of the shark deaths. Instead, it's focusing on implementing the Marine Life Protection Act and rebuilding fisheries such as Chinook salmon in-river and the ocean, amongst other issues.

[Leopard sharks (_Triakis semifasciata_) are found along the Pacific coast of North America, from the US state of Oregon to Mazatl√°n in Mexico. Leopard shark is a temperate shark of both inshore and offshore continental littoral waters, generally found on or near the bottom in shallow water from the intertidal to 20 m (about 66 ft) depth, although they have been found as deep as 156 m (about 512 ft). This species is generally found over soft bottom habitats and around rocky reefs and kelp forests. For a picture go to http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/218/730/218730804_640.jpg.

Marine ciliates belonging to the order Scuticociliatida are histophagous (eating or subsisting on tissues) facultative parasites that occur in fish worldwide. _M. avidus_ is an opportunistic ectoparasite which was originally isolated from seahorses. Under some circumstances (yet to be established), this parasite can cause severe infection in muscle, brain, and gills, causing visible lesions such as ulcers around the mouth and in the skeletal muscles. - Mod.PMB
