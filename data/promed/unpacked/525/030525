News of the response

Press conference

- The Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, held a press conference in Kinshasa this Sat 8 Sep 2018 to take stock of the 1st month of the response to the Ebola virus disease outbreak in the northern province of Kivu.

Here are the key points of the press conference:
- The process of genetic sequencing of the virus by the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) confirmed that the strains of the virus responsible for the 2 epidemics declared this year [2018] in the Democratic Republic of Congo are different, although both belong to the species Ebola Zaire.
- The spread of the virus has been brought under control in Mangina, which is the epicenter of the current epidemic. However, the response efforts were slowed down by the community resistance center in the Ndindi district of Beni, which recorded 71% (17/24) of the last confirmed cases. The last confirmed cases in the neighboring areas of Butembo and Masereka are related to these cases of resistance in Beni who refused follow-up contacts and vaccination.
- Community resistance forced the coordination of the response to review its strategy in the city of Beni by directly involving community leaders meeting in local coordination. This strategy paid off, and community leaders convinced the family to cooperate with the health authorities. Members of this family, who are considered contacts, finally agreed to be vaccinated.
- The security situation in North Kivu province remains worrying, but so far it has not prevented the response teams from doing their job and reaching the areas affected by the epidemic.
- Regarding medical management, 26 patients were treated with mAb 114, Zmapp or Remdesivir. Of these 26 patients, 15 are cured and have been discharged from the Ebola Treatment Center (ETC); 6 have died, and 5 are hospitalized.

Follow-up of contacts
- The surveillance teams continue to trace the contacts of the last confirmed cases in the health zones of Butembo, Masereka and Kalunguta. A total of 5156 contacts have been recorded in the 7 health zones affected since 17 Aug 2018.

Vaccination
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 7069 people were vaccinated.

[While the outbreak appears to be slowing due to rapid response and vaccination, the virus is now in an urban area, which presents a high risk of further spread. This is further exacerbated by resistance in Beni to contact tracing and vaccination; this community resistance is a major obstacle to control. Education of the community through direct involvement of community leaders (500 religious leaders and 40 traditional healers as reported by Peter Salama) in Butembo on Ebola prevention and control measures appears to be assisting with counteracting the prevailing sentiment of refusal to assist with follow-up contacts and vaccination-refusal.

The genetic sequence analysis demonstrating difference between the strains of Ebola virus from the 2 DRC outbreaks points out the basic problem that Ebola virus is enzootic in the region. Only a change in cultural habits, such as the cessation of hunting and butchering of bush meat and unsafe burials will stop spillover of virus from the sylvatic to the human population and more outbreaks. - Mod.LK]

[2] Butembo
- Fri 7 Sep 2018, Butembo: More is known about the death of the 1st case of Ebola
Radio Moto Butembo-Beni [edited]
http://radiomotofm.info/lirearticle.php?billet=4667

The person in question died of Ebola virus disease in Butembo on Tue 4 Sep 2018. According to the daily bulletin of the epidemiological situation made public the night of Wed 5 Sep 2018, the person died at UCG university clinics in Butembo. She was buried safely in a cemetery that the epidemiological bulletin did not determine.

The response team reports that a sample taken Tue 4 Sep 2018 from the deceased in Butembo is the 1st positive case of Ebola virus disease in this city. This is a contact from Beni who refused to cooperate with the health authorities and fled to Butembo after falling ill. Health personnel, having already been trained on how to deal with suspicious cases, have respected the individual protection measures around this case, reports our source.

It must be remembered that a coordination monitoring team moved to Butembo after receiving information that several contacts living in Beni had already moved to Butembo. This Wed 5 Sep 2018, the coordinator of the response, Dr Njdoloko Tambwe Bathe, arrived in Butembo with other coordinators to set up a full response team. These emissaries from the Ebola Response Directorate also identified the location sites of the mobile laboratory and the new Ebola Treatment Center in Butembo. The vaccination of the 1st identified contacts could also begin in this city according to the communication service of the response team.

Meanwhile, the National Border Health Program has mapped the mobility of the population in the areas affected by the epidemic in collaboration with the World Immigration Organization. It identified 5 priority areas for strengthening surveillance at ports of entry. These priority areas are Mangina-Kyanzaba-Mabalako, Mangina-Beni, Beni-Maboya-Butembo, Beni-Bunia / Beni-Kisangani and Beni-Kasindi. At this stage of the response, vaccination continues in areas affected by Ebola. According to Wednesday's [5 Sep 2018] bulletin on the epidemiological situation, since the beginning of the vaccination, on 8 Aug 2018, more than 6343 people have been vaccinated in Beni, Mabalako, Oicha, Katwa-Butembo and Kinshasa.

[It is praiseworthy how rapid the response to the case and contacts in Butembo. This report also highlights the use of mapping movements of people to strengthen monitoring borders to prevent international spread of Ebola virus. - Mod.LK]

A mobile lab was set up today [7 Sep 2018] in Butembo, DRC in order to quickly confirm suspected cases of Ebola. This is the 4th mobile lab set up so far in response to this outbreak

Ebola contact tracing teams have identified more than 280 contacts in Butembo, DRC, and vaccination teams have vaccinated 170 people, including health workers. Contact tracing and vaccination also started in Masereka, south of Butembo, following confirmation of a case there.

[Peter Salama comments on Twitter on the response to the Ebola case being confirmed in Butembo. In spite of the difficulty of the situation, contact tracing appears to be moving forward well. But unless all contacts are identified, it remains a risky situation. - Mod.LK
