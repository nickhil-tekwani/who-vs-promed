Vaccination of southern white rhinos at Lake Nakuru National Park has started following an anthrax outbreak that has killed 10 buffaloes.

The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) yesterday [7 Apr 2019] confirmed that the dead buffaloes tested positive for anthrax. Four more buffalo carcasses were found after the dead 10.

Susan Koech, the Principal Secretary for wildlife, said the 4 carcasses were found by KWS patrolling teams, although it has not been confirmed that they died of anthrax.

While commenting on the rhino vaccinations, Dr Koech said: "Currently, 14 of the 15 white rhinos have been vaccinated and so have 4 of the 63 black rhinos."

Anthrax has claimed 4 more buffaloes in Lake Nakuru National Park, raising the total to 14, as buffalo and rhino vaccination began yesterday [8 Apr 2019]. Four white rhinos have been vaccinated, and 63 remaining black rhinos will also receive injections. The park's 15 white rhinos will be vaccinated within 10 days.

Rhinos share the same range with buffaloes, as do giraffes. The park has 5000 buffaloes, while its capacity is only 1000. Plans are underway to relocate healthy animals to other parks.

Ten buffaloes and a waterbuck died of anthrax and anthrax-like symptoms over the weekend in Lake Nakuru Park. Four more deaths were reported yesterday [8 Apr 2019], and samples were sent for testing. Anthrax can also sicken and kill humans, but the park remains open, and people are usually infected only if they touch infected carcasses, experts said. They can also be infected by breathing in spores of the anthrax bacteria.

State Department of Wildlife PS Dr Susan Koech yesterday [8 Apr 2019] said teams are working on the ground to curb the spread. She said that from today they will increase aerial reconnaissance and patrols in the park to spot sick and dead animals and keep the disease from spreading.

Dr Obadiah Njagi, the director of Veterinary Services, yesterday [8 Apr 2019] told the Star that an anthrax outbreak in rhinos was reported in 2017.

Anthrax is a zoonotic disease that infects both animals and humans. He said Nakuru county is a hotspot for anthrax outbreaks, especially the Rongai area. "We have never been able to establish why, but we only relate this to historical incidents. Once an outbreak occurs, the bacteria can stay in the soil for up to 10 years," Njagi said [Yes, but they have to maintain a sufficient number of live spores in the soil to infect a grazing animal, not just keep a microbiologist busy. Survival very much depends on circumstances. - Mod.MHJ]

KWS head of corporate communications Paul Gathitu said precautions were being taken to ensure the remains are not eaten by scavengers. "We followed the protocols on how we burn the carcass and disinfect the site to avoid contamination," he said.

The 1st case of buffalo deaths was reported on 29 Mar 2019, prompting the KWS team to move in immediately. The disease was confirmed after samples were screened at a lab in Nakuru. Gathitu said drought was responsible for some deaths as wind blows the dust containing anthrax spores, which can be inhaled. This kind of infection is the most serious. [Drought would certainly stress the animals, thereby reducing the necessary infectious dose. Pneumonic anthrax does not occur with wildlife. The risk comes from the drought pushing animals to graze in places with some soil moisture where the spores will be in adequate numbers to infect the grazing animals. - Mod.MHJ].

KWS staff have gone for anti-anthrax jabs in Nakuru and have been given protective gear.

Gathitu downplayed congestion as being a major factor in the spread of the disease. "The population is high, but it contributes only a little; it's not the main factor," he said.

The last time the disease spread in the park was in 2015. Gathitu said most buffaloes are not affected. He said the situation is being monitored, and once the rains start, he is optimistic the situation will be under control.

Farmers in Nakuru and its environs have been put on a high alert and urged to vaccinate their livestock. They have been warned that anthrax spores can be spread by the wind. Farmers should avoid handling animals that suddenly get sick and call a veterinary officer. Animals weakened by the drought are susceptible. "People should report seeing dead animals and only eat meat slaughtered in an authorised area where it has been inspected by a vet," Njagi said.

The 1st case was detected on 29 Mar 2019. The team on the ground includes 15 officers, including 3 veterinarians, 4 scientists, and 8 supporting officers.

Residents said the sewer near the park could contribute to spread of the disease in Nakuru Town and environs. "Fencing the sewer around Lake Kanuu will really help curb the disease. It's easy for animals to come into contact with the bacteria because they drink from the sewer," farmer Peter Yatich said.

This post said they suspected the 18-22 people were infected with anthrax from milk, but I can't find much past evidence of milk from infected animals being infectious.

This from WHO, annex 6, section 3: "Animals with anthrax do not usually discharge the infecting organism in their milk before death, although there have been occasional exceptions (see (2) below; sections 3.3.8 & 3.5.2; Annex 5, section 2.7). Secretion of milk would normally be expected to cease with onset of bacteraemia and illness. The organism would normally only gain entry to the milk-secreting glands through breakdown of blood-vessel walls at terminal stages of the disease, long after secretion of milk had stopped (M'Fadyean, 1909). Milk from other healthy animals in the herd/flock poses no risk of carrying anthrax organisms;" https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/anthrax_web.pdf.

Most anthrax outbreaks in recent history have been recorded in beef cattle and bison. Anthrax can also occur in dairy cattle. However, the risk of contracting anthrax from milk or dairy products is extremely low; http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/anthrax/fact-sheet/eng/1375205846604/1375206913111.

[The wildlife outbreak appears to be winding down; vaccination has been initiated, which is worthy and not without problems, and proper ground & aerial surveillance has been initiated, plus proper carcass disposal. The Kenyan Veterinary Services and State Department of Wildlife are to be commended.

Yes, the initial report stated, "More than 22 people from Tegat Village in Molo were admitted at the Nyayo hospital in Elburgon, with residents fearing they may have contracted anthrax after consuming milk from a sick cow. According to Emily Sang, the Nyumba Kumi chairperson of the area, the 22 include the owner of the cow, his wife and 2 children. Elburgon assistant commissioner Naftali Korir says 18 people have been treated and discharged."

This was a fear of infection from the milk, and from the medical response they were treated with oral antibiotics and discharged. The actual risk from consuming milk from a cow sick with anthrax can be contentious, though I doubt if I would volunteer to find out the reality. The onset of this disease in cattle can be sudden. This cow could well have been milked as usual, and then been dead the next morning with yesterday's milk still in the kitchen at breakfast and the cow dead in the yard. Gastroenteric anthrax is rough, and if they were so infected, they would have needed to be hospitalised, not sent home. But it is an honest fear. When I was a veterinary student at Cambridge, one of our teachers was Storey Pugh; he had had an interesting time as a POW with the Germans. But I remember him telling us how he had, when in practice, consumed milk unknowingly at the moment from a cow on the farm that he had just diagnosed with anthrax. He survived, but it was a worrisome 24-36 hours, and he did not recommend that we follow his example. Nor do I. - Mod.MHJ
