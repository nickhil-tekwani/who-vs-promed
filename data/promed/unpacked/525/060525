Blue Bell Creameries announced on Tue 14 Jul 2015, that an investment by prominent Texas businessman Sid Bass will "ensure" the return of its ice cream products to the market. Blue Bell released a statement Tuesday announcing Bass has become a partner.

Roughly 1/4 of Texas cases [of listeriosis] involving _Listeria_, which contaminated Blue Bell ice cream and forced a crippling national recall in April [2015], are not submitted to public health officials as required by law and go untracked, a newspaper reported [Sun 19 Jul 2015]. Texas is not alone: Many state health departments in the USA don't receive samples in 10 to 40 percent of confirmed [listeriosis] cases to enter into databases, which can leave regulators unable to trace an outbreak, leave deadly food on the market and help companies avoid responsibility, the Houston Chronicle reported (http://bit.ly/1RH7ipI [see below]).

The Blue Bell outbreak could have been identified sooner had [listeriosis] reporting been better around the country, said Richard Danila, assistant state epidemiologist for the Minnesota State Health Department. Blue Bell ice cream was linked to 10 [listeriosis] illnesses in 4 states, including 3 deaths in Kansas.

Submitting bacterial cultures can be an afterthought to doctors focused on saving patients, and shipping pathogens comes with expensive and complex requirements.
"The clinical laboratory is there for the diagnosis and treatment of the patient," said Shari Shea, director of food safety for the Association of Public Health Laboratories. "There's not always appreciation for the way it fits into the public health system." At least 19 states don't have laws requiring laboratories to submit confirmed _Listeria_ samples, or "isolates," to state health officials. Of those that do, Texas hovers around the middle of the pack in states missing samples in confirmed cases, according to the Council to Improve Foodborne Outbreak Response.

But despite Texas requiring laboratories to submit samples, the state has never enforced the mandate. Texas Department of State Health Services spokeswoman Carrie Williams said the agency instead prefers to work with labs and health providers to educate them and bring them into compliance. Penalties are almost never enforced in any state, said Craig Hedberg, epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota. He said part of the reason is that public health departments depend on relationships with laboratories.

No date has been given for when Blue Bell products could be back in stores.

In October 2013, [the patient] missed work and didn't answer calls and texts. His friends found him at home -- pale, unconscious, and barely breathing. His temperature was as high as 107 deg F [41.7 deg C] before he was admitted to an intensive care unit. He woke up after 6 days on a respirator to find his nervous system ravaged. He couldn't walk, talk, or swallow. His listeriosis, confirmed by doctors at a Houston hospital, has not been definitively linked to Blue Bell Creameries, and the company denies a connection. But [the patient] is one of thousands of Americans whose severe foodborne illnesses have never been properly counted or studied -- and not because the technology doesn't exist. [The patient], 32, contends he also is a victim of the Blue Bell outbreak and has filed suit. He has had to put his career on hold, move back home to Maryland to live with his parents and is relearning how to walk and talk. His brain damage is permanent.

20 years ago, finding the source of a food poisoning outbreak was like playing a twisted lottery. If you got really sick, you might go to the doctor and find out it was _Salmonella_. But there was no way of knowing where the bacteria came from or if someone 10 states over had drawn the same bad luck. Everything changed in 1996, the year the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] launched PulseNet. Now the same technology linking a prison inmate to a stray hair from a murder committed 25 years ago can be used to connect illnesses to food. In PulseNet, the CDC keeps a database of bacterial DNA from public health laboratories that extract it from people who got sick. It has more than half a million isolates. Now health officials know if people in San Francisco and New York ate the same tainted corned beef, and whether tests from that beef processing plant show organisms with the same DNA pattern. With PulseNet, they can pull bad food off the market in a relative heartbeat. With PulseNet, they can find the dirty factory.

Still, it's an intricate web of data, of DNA bar codes, of petri dishes and test tubes and USD 100 000 machines, of laboratories that reek of rotting meat where biologists in white coats render food into a vomit-like slime, then extract the pathogens; of doctors and nurses and forms and long questionnaires about what people ate and when. In the center of the web is the CDC. Then there is a ring of state and local public health laboratories, then a ring of commercial testing laboratories -- like Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp -- then rings of hospitals and doctors' offices.

Each thread in the web is a flow of information. If one of them fails, the web comes down: Health regulators can't trace the outbreak. Deadly food stays on the market. The sick and injured, and families of the dead, can't get answers. Companies can avoid responsibility. When [the 32-year-old patient]'s world shattered in Houston, the web there to help him fell apart.

In January [2015], South Carolina health officials were randomly testing frozen desserts when they found _Listeria_ in an ice cream cookie sandwich and ice cream-on-a-stick made by Blue Bell. Texas health officials then tested samples from the Brenham [Texas] plant in February [2015] and found _Listeria_ in a 3rd product, individually wrapped scoops of vanilla. The company quietly withdrew them from the market but did not issue a public recall until March [2015]. By April [2015], what Blue Bell had initially cast as a problem isolated to a single machine was clearly a systemic sanitation failure affecting multiple plants and dating at least to 2009.

The cracking reputation of a Texas icon [Blue Bell] attracted widespread coverage. And then it dawned on [the 32-year-old Houston patient]. Could the treats that allayed his sweet tooth in Texas be responsible for ravaging his brain? He had moved to Houston after college in Maryland and starting his career in Massachusetts to become an administrator at Eagle's Trace, an assisted living facility with 462 apartments. One of Blue Bell's many institutional accounts, it's just 75 miles [121 km] from the biggest little creamery in Texas. [The patient] had discovered the hallowed Texas brand and eaten it often -- many sizes, many flavors. He connected with Pritzker Olsen, a national food poisoning law firm based in Minnesota. After investigating for about 2 months, the firm filed the 1st [listeriosis] lawsuit against Blue Bell on [15 May 2015]. [The patient] and his attorneys don't know what happened to his isolate.

In a typical scenario, a doctor would order a spinal tap on a bacterial meningitis patient to extract fluid containing the bacteria. It would be sent to a commercial laboratory. There, microbiologists would use a sterile cotton swab to drag a broth containing the bacteria across a plate embedded with a growth medium, usually made of sheep's blood. Within a day or two, they would see colonies of _Listeria_ blossom like snowflakes against the blood-red plate. The hospital would get the result, and the isolate broth would go to the Houston Department of Health and Human Services laboratory.

There, microbiologists would break the bacteria cells open, extract sections of DNA and place them in an electric field, causing them to separate, by weight, into a series of lines like a bar code -- the DNA fingerprint. An image of the bar code would be uploaded to PulseNet, the CDC database. If it matched the bar code of _Listeria_ isolated from Blue Bell ice cream, [the patient] would officially become part of the outbreak. If not, it would remain in the national database and could be compared with DNA from future illnesses and contaminated food. Either way, the broth would go into a freezer for indefinite storage at [-112 deg F / -80 deg C], readily available for health authorities, or lawyers.

One of [the Houston patient]'s attorneys, has said they know he tested positive for _Listeria_ through medical records, but know nothing else about his isolate -- it appears neither Houston, Texas, nor federal health authorities have records for [this patient], based on requests made by the law firm. Privacy laws prevent the agencies from discussing individual cases with others.

[The patient]'s attorneys are not speaking at length about his case, and they advised him not to speak, either. It doesn't help them to broadcast that there is no smoking gun. They remain confident, however, that his food history, which includes records derived from a grocery card, and expert epidemiologists' testimony will be enough to show it is more likely than not -- the standard in a civil trial -- that tainted Blue Bell [ice cream] made him sick. Blue Bell is not commenting on the lawsuit but has issued a categorical denial in its initial answer in court.

The case is far from a slam dunk for [the patient]. _Listeria_ may incubate for 70 days in the body. [meaning the incubation period for listeriosis, that is, the time it takes for symptoms to develop after exposure, is up to 70 days.] It has been found on meats, cheeses, fruits, and can live in almost any ready-to-eat food. Blue Bell's lawyers will likely press him to recall everything he ate for weeks in 2013.

Most state health departments are missing isolates in 10 percent to 40 percent of confirmed cases of _Listeria_, _Salmonella_, and _E. coli_ infection, according to research by the Council to Improve Foodborne Outbreak Response. Some are much better, some far worse. Texas hovers around the middle of the pack, missing about 25 percent for [listeriosis] cases in the last 5 years.

Overwhelmed doctors' offices may not have time for the paperwork. Clinical labs need someone specially certified in shipping pathogens. Private courier services have complex, expensive requirements for shipping and handling, and can refuse packages for any reason. And when saving the patient is the 1st priority, bacterial cultures can be an afterthought. "The clinical laboratory is there for the diagnosis and treatment of the patient," said Shari Shea, director of food safety for the Association of Public Health Laboratories. "There's not always appreciation for the way it fits into the public health system."

More trouble looms. Increasingly, clinical and commercial laboratories are turning to new tests that identify the pathogen without the need to grow the bacteria in a culture. They give doctors a diagnosis quickly without an isolate. Health officials around the country are scrambling to figure out how to continue to obtain cultures for outbreak surveillance, and who will pay for it.

But epidemiologists generally agree that for every laboratory-confirmed listeriosis case, another one goes undetected.

[ProMED-mail previously reported this multistate outbreak of listeriosis traced to eating _Listeria_-contaminated ice cream manufactured by Blue Bell Creameries ("See Also's" below). For discussions of listeriosis, please see my comments in prior ProMED-mail posts listed below.

The news reports above highlight problems that the CDC's program called PulseNet has with data collection. PulseNet maintains an electronic database of bacterial 'DNA fingerprints' from isolates of bacteria involved in foodborne illnesses that were submitted by state and local public health laboratories. PulseNet compares the 'DNA fingerprints' to determine if any patterns match. Clusters of matching patterns are investigated by epidemiologists and if links are found between cases, the cluster is classified as an outbreak, as was done in the Blue Bell Creameries listeriosis outbreak (http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/outbreak-detection/index.html). - Mod.ML
