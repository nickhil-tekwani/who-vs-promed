New bird flu strain kills 2 patients in Shanghai
---------------------------------------
So far, 2 men suffering from a lesser-known type of bird flu have died in Shanghai and a woman in eastern Anhui Province is in a critical condition, health authorities said yesterday [31 Mar 2013]. The 3 cases of H7N9 avian influenza infection are the 1st time the virus has been detected in humans, the National Health and Family Planning Commission said yesterday. The men were an 87-year-old who took ill on 19 Feb 2013 and died on 4 Mar 2013, and a 27-year-old who became ill on 27 Feb 2013 and died on 10 Mar 2013. A 35-year-old woman from Chuzhou City in Anhui became ill on 9 Mar 2013 and is being treated in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province.

All 3 showed initial symptoms of fever and coughing which developed into severe pneumonia with difficulty in breathing in later stages, according to the commission. There was no sign that any of the 3 had contracted the disease from each other, and no sign of infection in the 88 people who had closest contact with them. H7N9 [avian influenza virus is considered a low pathogenic strain that cannot easily be contracted by humans. The overwhelming majority of human deaths from bird flu has been caused by the more virulent H5N1 virus, which decimated poultry stocks across Asia [beginning] in 2003.

The World Health Organization is "closely monitoring the situation" in China, regional agency spokesman Timothy O'Leary told the Associated Press. "There is apparently no evidence of human-to-human transmission, and transmission of the virus appears to be inefficient, therefore the risk to public health would appear to be low," O'Leary said. The 3 cases were confirmed to be human infection with H7N9 avian influenza by a team of experts called in by the health commission. On Friday [29 Mar 2013], the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention [isolated H7N9] virus from samples from the patients.

The commission said it was still unclear how the 3 got infected. "So far, it is still an animal virus not a human virus," said Jiang Qingwu, dean of Public Health School of Fudan University. Since only 3 cases of human infection of H7N9 have been found, relatively little research has been done on it. The expert team is working to study the toxicity and human-infection capacity of the virus, the commission said.

Yesterday, Shanghai Health Bureau said cases of flu and pneumonia in the city were normal for this time of the year. The 87-year-old's 2 sons have gone to hospital with similar symptoms. According to Shanghai No. 5 People's Hospital, the 3 members of the Li family were admitted between 14 and 24 Feb 2013 for symptoms including a high fever and coughing. All 3 were diagnosed as having pneumonia. The 69-year-old son recovered and was discharged but the 55-year-old died from severe pneumonia and respiratory failure in late February. The father died of multi-organ failure. Neither son had the H7N9 virus, the bureau said.

It has ordered local hospitals to step up monitoring and supervision on cases involving flu, pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. Experts say there is no evidence to indicate the virus is spreading but patients with symptoms such as fever, coughing and breathing difficulties are being urged to visit their doctors, ensure good hygiene, such as by washing their hands, and avoid contact with diseased poultry and livestock.

[This new report adds only the information that 2 sons of the deceased 87-year-old patient, were hospitalised about the same time (and one of whom died) with similar symptoms, were not infected with the avian H7N9 influenza virus. There is thus still no evidence that the low pathogenic avian H7N9 influenza virus can be transmitted onward from one human to another human, even close relatives. - Mod.CP]

[A/duck/Mongolia/119/2008(H7N9)is a LPAI mentioned in Wu Hai-bo, Lu Ru-feng, Wo En-kang et al. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of H7N3 avian influenza viruses isolated from poultry in China in 2011. Arch Virol(2012) 157:2017-2021.

The pathogenicity of the current strain (human) for poultry deserves to be established though it is unlikely to be HPAI.

There is an abstract about its isolation from wild birds in Mongolia in the abstracts of the 14th ICID (2012, by Tseren-Ochir et al.)[not available online].
