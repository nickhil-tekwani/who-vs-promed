The Florida Department of Health has reported 8 cases of _Vibrio vulnificus_ infection so far in 2015, including 2 fatalities. The deaths have been reported in Brevard and Marion counties, according to a health department update Thursday, 11 Jun 2015. The 8 cases have been reported from the following counties -- Brevard (1), Broward (2), Duval (1), Marion (1), Pasco (1), Santa Rosa (1) and St. Lucie (1).

In 2014, Florida reported 41 _V. vulnificus_ cases, including 12 deaths, the most cases seen from 2008 to present.

_Vibrio vulnificus_ is a naturally occurring bacterium in warm, brackish seawater.

_V. vulnificus_ causes disease in individuals who eat contaminated seafood (usually raw or undercooked oysters) or have an open wound that is exposed to seawater. Among healthy people, ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Most of the infections are acute and have no long-term consequences.

In immunocompromised persons, particularly those with chronic liver disease, _V. vulnificus_ can invade the bloodstream from either a wound or from the GI tract, causing a severe and life-threatening illness called primary septicemia, characterized by fever, chills, septic shock and death. Blistering skin lesions accompany the disease in about 70 percent of the cases. _V. vulnificus_ bloodstream infections are fatal about 50 percent of the time. These individuals are 80-200 times more likely to develop _V. vulnificus_ primary septicemia than are healthy people. For this particular risk group, the infection carries one of the highest mortality rates of all bacterial infections.

[There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and (as stated in the posting) that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ now includes more northern geographical areas, related to the effects of global warming. - Mod.LL
