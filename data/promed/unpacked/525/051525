Veerman increases stamping-out
------------------------------
Minister Veerman has ordered the depopulation of almost all poultry farms
within the Gelders Valley. Veerman has announced that from now on, all
poultry farms within a 3 km radius of infected farms will be depopulated;
until now, the radius was 1 km. The number of farms to be cleared is more
than 750, most within the Gelders Valley. The total number of poultry farms
in the Netherlands is 3000, including 100 million chickens. 9 million
chickens have already been culled, a number that will now increase by at
least 2 million.
In the meantime, fowl-plague virus has been detected in dead wild birds
(ducks and crows). Within a few days it should become clear whether this
virus is identical to the one causing the outbreak.

[Many species of wild birds -- particularly waterbirds and seabirds -- are
known to be susceptible to avian influenza (AI). In fact, AI viruses are
probably ubiquitous in wild waterbirds, though infections in these birds
are generally subclinical. The confirmation of the alleged infection in
crows will be surprising; available information from the relevant
laboratories will be appreciated.
The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture announced on 2 Apr 2003 that the
total number of "definitely infected" farms has reached 153, of which 7
maintain pet avians. 43 farms are "seriously suspected", of which 7
maintain pet avians. The current situation is detailed in a letter of 1 Apr
2003 from Minister Veerman to the Parliament, available on the ministry's
web-site:
<http://www.minlnv.nl/infomart/parlemnt/2003/par03098.htm>
It mentions the registration of some 900 pet-bird farms, where
AI-susceptible avians are to be culled as well. The minister refers also to
surveillance in dead wild birds, mentioning positive findings in blood tests
of some (no details on species nor of the tests used), indicating that
identification of the virus type involved is expected within a few days. -
