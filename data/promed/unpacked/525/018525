Japan has lifted its weeklong ban on United States poultry exports but will
continue blocking those from Connecticut because of fear that a bird flu
could spread, the US Agriculture Department (USDA) said on Thursday.
Ed Curlett, a spokesman for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS), said tests confirmed an outbreak of low-pathogenic avian influenza
among 4.7 million laying hens in Connecticut. The birds, owned by the egg
farm, remain quarantined. "We're working with Connecticut on a plan, but a
final decision on what's going to happen to those birds has not been made,"
Curlett said.
Federal and state officials believed the birds were infected last week.
They are monitoring the virus but it hasn't spread, Curlett said.
The illness can cause coughing and other flu-like symptoms in birds. It is
not a threat to humans, but it is contagious for birds and can be spread
through their feces. Toby Moore, a spokesman for USA Poultry and Egg Export
Council, said officials won't know for several weeks how much the ban cost
the US producers.
Japan is the leading importer of US egg products and the 10th largest buyer
of US chicken and other poultry meat. In Connecticut, the egg industry has
annual receipts of between USD 60 million to USD 100 million.
Avian flu is highly contagious among birds, though it has spread to people
in a few isolated cases. A 2 week outbreak in the Netherlands has shown
signs of spreading. Hundreds of thousands of chickens have been slaughtered
to contain the outbreak. History is repeating itself for US poultry
producers. They suffered trade losses in 2001 when Japan imposed a ban
because avian influenza had infected Connecticut flocks. Chicken exports to
Japan sank to 55 000 tons last year from 106 000 tons in 2001, costing
nearly USD 75 million in losses, he said.
