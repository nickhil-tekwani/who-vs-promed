CDC is collaborating with public health and agriculture officials in many states and the USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP), and Veterinary Services to investigate an outbreak of human salmonellosis linked to chicks and ducklings from a single mail-order hatchery in Ohio. Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify cases of illness that may be part of these outbreaks. In PulseNet, the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC, DNA "fingerprints" of salmonellae are obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak

Contact with live poultry can be a source of human salmonellosis. You should always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water right after touching live poultry or anything in the area where they live and roam. Adults should supervise hand washing for young children. Additional recommendations are available.

Mail-order hatcheries, agricultural feed stores, and others who sell or display chicks, ducklings, and other live poultry should provide health-related information to owners and potential purchasers of these birds prior to the point of purchase. This should include information about the risk of acquiring a Salmonella infection from contact with live poultry.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
As of 25 May 2012, a total of 93 persons infected with outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ Infantis, _Salmonella_ Newport, and _Salmonella_ Lille have been reported from 23 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Alabama (3), Georgia (3), Illinois (1), Indiana (2), Kentucky (4), Louisiana (1), Massachusetts (1), Maryland (1), Maine (2), Michigan (1), Nebraska (1), New Jersey (1), North Carolina (9), New York (13), Ohio (26), Pennsylvania (9), Rhode Island (1), South Carolina (1), Tennessee (4), Texas (1), Virginia (6), Vermont (1), and West Virginia (1).

Among the persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between 1 Mar 2012 and 19 May 2012. Infected individuals range in age from less than 1 year old to 100 years old, and 37 percent of ill persons are 10 years of age or younger. 50 percent of ill persons are female. Among 36 ill persons with available information, 18 (50 percent) have been hospitalized. One death possibly related to this outbreak is under investigation.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with animals and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. 37 (90 percent) of 41 ill persons interviewed reported contact with live chicks and ducklings before becoming ill. All of the 32 ill persons with available vendor information reported purchasing chicks and ducklings. Ill persons reported purchasing live poultry for backyard flocks to produce eggs or meat, or to keep as pets.

State health departments have tested chick and duckling samples collected from ill persons' homes. 4 chick and duckling samples from different homes in Ohio and New York yielded the outbreak strains of _S._ Infantis, _S._ Newport, and _S._ Lille.

Findings of multiple traceback investigations of live chicks and ducklings from homes of ill persons have identified a single mail-order hatchery in Ohio as the source of these chicks and ducklings. This is the same mail-order hatchery that was associated with the 2011 outbreak of _S._ Altona and _S._ Johannesburg infections. In May 2012, veterinarians from the Ohio Department of Agriculture inspected the mail-order hatchery and made recommendations for improvement.
