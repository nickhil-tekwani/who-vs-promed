Romania finds new suspected flu cases in poultry
-----------------------------------------------
Romania has found new suspected cases of bird flu in poultry in a
region west of the Danube delta, where the [virulent] strain of the
virus was 1st detected in October 2005, the farm ministry said on
Wednesday [11 Jan 2005]. The Balkan country has found the highly
pathogenic avian flu in 26 villages in and outside the Danube delta,
Europe's largest wetlands and a major migratory route for wild birds.
"Preliminary tests taken from domestic birds in the villages of
Ciresu and Dudesti in Braila county showed potential signs of the H5
type," the Agriculture Ministry said in a statement. It said the
villages would be quarantined and all domestic birds will be culled.
Romania has not recorded any bird flu cases in humans so far, but 2
people have died, and more than a dozen have been infected with the
virus in Turkey.
Authorities in the Bulgarian capital Sofia have banned the sale of
livestock as a precaution against bird flu. Sofia municipality
spokeswoman Tsveti Krasteva said the city would close its 4 livestock
markets. Police, veterinarians and city officials would ensure the
ban is observed.
Speaking to parliament, Agriculture Minister Nihat Kabil said the
virus had not yet been detected in Bulgaria, but the risk of its
emerging remained high due to the outbreaks in neighbors Romania and Turkey.

China Reports Bird Flu Outbreak in Southern Province of Guizhou
-----------------------------------------------
China reported a new outbreak of avian influenza in quails in the
southern province of Guizhou, according to a statement issued late
yesterday [10 Jan 2005] on the Ministry of Agriculture's website.
About 16 000 quail died between 1 and 6 Jan 2006 at a farm in Guiyang
city's Wudang area, the statement said. The infection was confirmed
by China's National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory yesterday
[10 Jan 2005] as having been caused by the H5N1 strain of bird flu, it said.
The local government's veterinarian department culled 42 000 quail at
the infection site on 6 Jan 2006, the agriculture ministry said. The
outbreak is "under control," it said.
China, the world's 2nd-biggest poultry meat producer, is vaccinating
all 14.2 billion farm poultry in the country to prevent fresh
outbreaks of avian influenza from increasing the risk of avian flu
spreading to humans and potentially mutating into a pandemic influenza.

Turkey's government has ordered more than 300 000 fowl destroyed as a
precaution and is considering a regional or even national cull of
birds to contain the virus. Authorities are also distributing
leaflets in eastern regions most affected by the outbreak, cautioning
people not to touch birds, while television advertisements urge
washing of hands and clothes after contact with poultry.
A Turkish journalist in the eastern city of Van told IRIN that teams
with loudspeakers had been touring villages in the east telling
people to give up their chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese or face
fines of up to 100 YTL (USD 74).
The journalist said the cull was being largely supported by poor
people in the region, because compensation of up to 15 YTL (USD 11)
was being offered per bird destroyed.
