A total of 175 people are now hospitalized in the Urals region
following a pneumonia outbreak believed to have been caused by
contamination in the hot water supply, local authorities said.
The infection spread in the Sverdlovsk Region after annual
maintenance to hot water pipes supplying homes. Four people are
confirmed to have died of pneumonia. A local Health Ministry
spokesman said one of the patients is in intensive care. Of the
patients, 150 have been diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease, a
severe form of pneumonia, and in 66 of these cases, the diagnosis has
been confirmed by laboratory tests. The spokesman said 31 people had
already been discharged from hospital and that most patients were
recovering following therapy. According to the ministry's data, one
other patient admitted in the outbreak has died, but a pneumonia
diagnosis has not been confirmed.
The outbreak of the infection was registered on 19 Jul 2007 in the
town of Verkhnyaya Pyshma, when 35 people were put in hospital. All
the patients are adult locals. The infection is believed to have
spread through the hot water supply after annual maintenance work. An
investigation is underway.
Legionnaires' disease, a type of lung infection, can be contracted by
breathing steam from water carrying the bacteria. Infection is often
spread from hot baths, showers or air conditioning. The bacteria do
not spread from person to person.
Most apartment blocks in Russia receive hot water via mains directly
from thermal plants, rather than from water heaters installed within
buildings. The supply is shut down for a few weeks each summer for
maintenance work.

ProMED Rapporteur Joseph P. Dudley
[Legionnaires' disease is acquired by inhalation by a susceptible
person of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_. Risk
factors include age over 50 years, cigarette smoking, diabetes,
chronic heart or lung disease, immunosuppression, and possibly
alcoholism. It is noteworthy that only adults are involved in the
Russian outbreak. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F)
support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing
systems. _Legionella_ are embedded in a bio-film that lines the inner
walls of the plumbing system's pipes and containers. Concentrations
of the organism can also be increased by disruption of this bio-film,
which is what seems to have occurred in the Russian outbreak. An
epidemiologic link to a particular means by which the _Legionella_
were aerosolized (for example, shower heads) is not noted, nor do we
have molecular fingerprint data that would link the _Legionella_ in
the plumbing to the _Legionella_ isolated from clinical specimens. - Mod.ML]
