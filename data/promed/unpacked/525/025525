Outbreak of norovirus gastroenteritis among staff at a hospital in
Barcelona, Spain, September 2007
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------
On 14 Sep 2007, an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis was reported
among health care workers (HCW) employed at a hospital in Barcelona,
Spain. The Infection Control Team (ICT) at the hospital was informed
that several HCW had become suddenly ill, suffering nausea, vomiting
and diarrhoea (without blood, pus or mucus in the stool) since 10 Sep 2007.

The working hypothesis was that meals at the hospital restaurant were
related to the cause of the outbreak. We designed an unmatched
case-control study, following standard operation procedures for
foodborne outbreak investigation. We collected preliminary basic data
and inspected the department premises in order to identify the source
and the likely pathogen of this outbreak. All HCW reporting vomiting
and/or diarrhoea who had lunch or dinner at the hospital restaurant
between 10 and 14 Sep 2007 were classified as cases. Available cases
were interviewed, either personally or by phone, using a structured
questionnaire. We collected data on the time and type of food
consumed at the hospital restaurant. Frozen samples from all meals
offered by the restaurant to HCW staff in this time period were
collected from the kitchen. Stool samples were available only from 4
cases, and were collected for microbiological analysis.

A total of 38 cases were identified and 31 of them were interviewed.
The remaining 7 cases could not be reached during the initial phases
of the study or declined to answer the questionnaire. We also
interviewed 31 unmatched HCW selected as controls among other staff
employed in the same departments and who also ate regularly at the
hospital restaurant. The age of cases ranged from 29 to 59 years. The
controls were between 24 and 63 years of age. Reported symptoms were
abdominal pain (n=27; 87 percent), nausea (n=25; 81 percent), watery
diarrhoea (n=24; 77 percent), vomiting (n=22; 71 percent), headache
(n=11; 35 percent) and low-grade fever (n=4; 13 percent). The disease
was mild in most cases. Only 4 cases sought medical advice, but none
was admitted to hospital. Symptoms lasted from four to 72 hours.

A total of 24 HCW affected by the outbreak do not have direct contact
with the patients in the hospital, because they work in support
services (laboratory, administration). All cases but one eat
regularly at the hospital's restaurant. There were no cases detected
among patients admitted at the hospital. The majority of cases (n=23)
occurred between 13 and 14 Sep 2007. There were no cases after 16
September. The earliest reported onset of symptoms was 8 Sept 2007.
This case and another one who fell ill on 13 Sep 2007 but for whom
the exact time of onset of symptoms is unknown are not included in
the epidemic curve (presented as a figure in the original test) but
we decided to include them in the outbreak investigation.

All types of food exposure were analysed by means of a logistic
regression technique, using as dependent variables being case or
control and as independent variables having eaten or not a particular
type of food. Cross tabs for all types of food were also performed.
HCW who reported to have eaten rice salad with cocktail sauce were
more likely to have become sick compared to HCW who did not eat rice
salad with cocktail sauce. (OR=4,11; CI95:1,14-14,72; p=0,03). A
waterborne source was ruled out (OR=0,675 CI95 percent:0,237-1,924).
Statistical analyses indicated that 12 Sep 2007 (the day when the
rice salad with cocktail sauce was served) was the most likely
starting date of the outbreak (OR day 12= 3,37 (p=0,07) vs OR day
10=0,56 (p=0,32)).

Norovirus was identified in 2 of the 4 stool samples available for
laboratory analysis. One of the 4 samples was taken from a staff
member working at the hospital's restaurant but it was negative. All
meals tested negative for bacteria, but were not analysed for
norovirus, because in Barcelona this testing is not routinely
performed on food.

The hypothesis that the outbreak was foodborne was confirmed by the
results of the epidemiological analysis and by the identification of
norovirus in 2 stool samples taken from cases. We believe that
norovirus contamination of rice salad with cocktail sauce was the
cause of the outbreak. Noroviruses are considered to be the most
frequent etiologic agents of food- and water-borne viral
gastroenteritis outbreaks [1]. A few outbreaks affecting hospital
staff have already been described [2,3]. It is likely that the
outbreak reported here was foodborne, caused by the contamination of
rice salad with cocktail sauce by norovirus and its further
dissemination. It is possible that the staff member working at the
restaurant (onset of symptoms on 8 Sep 2007) was the index case,
although his stool samples were negative for norovirus.

We believe that patients admitted to the hospital were not affected
by the outbreak because they did not share the same meals as offered
to HCW by the kitchen service. Fortunately, on 12 Sep 20007, the
patients had stew chickpeas and roasted chicken as lunch menu. They
did not have the choice of salad with cocktail sauce which we believe
to have caused the outbreak. The basic hygiene preventive measures
(notably hand washing) seemed to have worked well enough to help
further control the outbreak, probably because of the low likelihood
of direct contact between the affected HCW and patients.

[Recent descriptions of norovirus-associated gastroenteritis have
focussed on fecal-oral and droplet-borne transmission of infection in
situations where disparate groups of people have been brought into
close proximity such as on cruise ships, or in schools, hospitals and
hotels. The above report and the 2 following reports suggest that
approximately 50 percent of all norovirus outbreaks (in the USA at
least) can be linked to ill food-service workers. - Mod.CP]

Restaurant case shows how virus spreads
-------------------------------------------------------
Three staff members at a Michigan restaurant who showed up to work
sick with a stomach virus infected more than 360 people in the space
of a few days, health officials reported on Wednesday [21 Nov 2007].
The case demonstrates how easily and quickly a virus -- in this case
a norovirus -- can spread and shows how standard cleaning does a poor
job of eliminating viruses.

One of the workers vomited into a trash can and then continued
preparing food, including an appetizer platter. Fully a 3rd of the
people who ate there became ill that day, Brenda Brennan and Susan
Bohm of the Michigan Department of Health reported. They did not
identify the restaurant, which they said was in Eaton County in
south-central Michigan. "This report summarizes the findings of the
outbreak investigation, which determined that at least 364 restaurant
patrons had become ill," they wrote in the U.S. Center for Disease
Control and Prevention's weekly report on death and disease. The
incident took place in January 2006. Such investigations often take
months to track down and document fully.

Noroviruses are a group of viruses that cause "stomach flu," or
gastroenteritis. The CDC estimates there are 23 million acute cases
of norovirus infection every year in the United States alone --
marked by nausea, diarrhea and cramps. "Approximately 50 percent of
all norovirus outbreaks are linked to ill food-service workers," the
report reads.

The virus is spread by the fecal-oral route, but similar viruses can
live on surfaces for as long as 4 weeks. Bleach will kill norovirus.
"In this outbreak, the restaurant's use of cleaning cloths soaked
with a quaternary ammonium-based cleaning product likely was
ineffective in disinfecting the restaurant," the report reads. After
the outbreak, Michigan officials issued new recommendations.

-- They 1st call for exposed food and items such as paper napkins,
takeout containers and straws to be discarded.

-- All surface areas within at least a 25-foot (8-meter) radius of
the vomiting site should be disinfected with a bleach solution.

-- Sick employees should stay home for at least 3 days after
symptoms start to get better and should not be allowed to handle
kitchenware or ready-to-eat food for 3 more days.

-- Restaurants should also consider closing for a time after someone
vomits and restrooms should be closed until they can be cleaned with bleach.

[A full account of this investigation is included in the MMWR Weekly
for 23 Nov 2007: "Norovirus Outbreak Associated with ill FoodService
Workers in Michigan, January/February 2006"
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5646a2.htm? s_cid=mm5646a2_e>.

In 2006, the Michigan Department of Health received 144 reports of
suspected or confirmed norovirus outbreaks throughout Michigan,
compared with 34 in 2005. Norovirus genogroup II (GII) was identified
in 97 percent of the 89 confirmed outbreaks in the state during 2006;
GI was identified in the remaining 3 percent of the outbreaks. During
2000/2004, the predominant genogroup in calicivirus outbreaks in the
United States was GII (79 percent), followed by GI (19 percent) and
sapovirus (2 percent). No other GI/4 outbreaks were detected in
Michigan in 2006. In this outbreak, the detection of one norovirus
genogroup (GI/4) in all stool specimens, including that of line cook
A, suggests a single source of infection. - Mod.CP]

Norovirus Cases Confirmed In Aptos Illness Outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------------
One of the 99 people suffering from an outbreak of gastrointestinal
illness at an Aptos hotel has tested positive for norovirus, the
chief of Santa Cruz County Public Health has confirmed on Friday [16
Nov 2007], the public health department issued an advisory regarding
the outbreak of a foodborne illness at a restaurant in the Seascape
Resort and Conference Center.

Since the outbreak the health agency worked to contact more than 1000
people who visited the hotel between 9 and 15 Nov 2007. "We are just
monitoring the Seascape for the meantime," said Bob Kennedy, chief of
Santa Cruz County Public Health. The health agency was contacted on
13 Nov 2007 regarding 16 people who had become ill out of a group of
64 that had been involved in a weekend event between 9 and 11 Nov 2007.

The restaurant reopened Friday [16 Nov 2007] night after a thorough
cleaning of all facilities and a complete review of procedures with
71 hotel and restaurant employees. New policies have been put into
place to help combat future outbreaks, including an hourly
hand-washing cycle, illness checks at the beginning of each shift and
a log of the checks to be reviewed by Santa Cruz County Public Health.

With the upcoming holiday season Kennedy recommends that people use
proper food-handling techniques and wash their hands frequently.
Norovirus causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea and can be fatal to
the elderly if left untreated due to symptoms like dehydration.
