After controls in a cattle farm in the municipality of Liry, a new outbreak of tuberculosis was confirmed by the Ardennes veterinary services.

This livestock was initially an epidemiological link with livestock that was infected with bovine tuberculosis in the Oise department [north of France] (involving the sale of a bovine that later tested positive for lesions when brought to the slaughterhouse).

The various controls in the cattle have served to highlight one positive and 8 suspicious to intradermal comparative tests. After slaughtering the 9 diagnosed cattle, bacteriological analyses carried on a suspected bovine have confirmed the presence of _Mycobacterium bovis_.

The strain in question is called "SB0120", similar to that found in previous outbreaks of bovine tuberculosis detected near the municipalities of Semide and Sugny, as well as of infected badgers found in the municipalities of Contreuve and Mont-Saint-Martin. The bovine from the Ardennes region sold in the Oise department that was infected also carried the strain "SB0120".

All the animals in the infected farm, in this case 44 bovines (of the lactating type), will be slaughtered very soon (there is a regulatory time limit of one month from the declaration of infection).

Further epidemiological investigations are ongoing.

Bovine tuberculosis is a bacterial cattle disease that is transmissible to man. Ruminants, domestic and wild animals (mainly cattle and deer), but also wild boars, badgers or foxes can become infected. Since 2001, France has been "officially free of bovine tuberculosis." However, every year, 100 or so reservoirs are found despite control measures that have been implemented.

[According to the EU's Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS), France reported 75 outbreaks of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle during the period from 1 Jan to 9 Jul 2013. For comparison: the Netherlands reported, during the same period, 4 outbreaks; Switzerland, from 1 Jan to 11 Jun 2013, 10 outbreaks; UK, from 1 Jan to 14 Jun 2013, 1 outbreak. For other EU countries, see http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/adns_outbreaks_per_disease_en.pdf.

The annual (herd) prevalence of bTB in cattle in France is currently about 0.07 percent; the annual incidence is about 0.04 percent. The disease is rare but it still occurs at low levels in some areas; there is presence of the disease in wildlife in some of these areas.

France is "officially bTB free" since December 2000, according to international criteria ("at least 99.8 percent of the herds free"). Herd surveillance has been maintained in areas with historical background and in herds with high potential for spread (such as raw milk dairy farms). - Mod.AS
