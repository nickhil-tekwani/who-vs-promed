[According to the report above, a total of 82 901 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 14 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (8 May 2020) report. The newly reported cases are in Shanghai municipality (imported), 11 indigenous cases in Jilin province and 1 indigenous case in Hubei province) and 1 new case of suspected infection (an imported case) in Inner Mongolia autonomous region. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, no newly confirmed cases were reported in the past 24 hours. Macau and Taiwan have reported no newly confirmed cases.

There were 20 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, including 1 imported case. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 794, and 48 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic, in order to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. While there had been locally transmitted cases in both Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, there was one new reported case in Guangdong on 6 May 2020 and no reports of cases in Heilongjiang since 30 Apr 2020. In recent days, the main concern are importations.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 34 cases and 0 deaths compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (8 to 9 May 2020) when there were 18 newly confirmed cases and 0 deaths. A total of 10 874 confirmed cases and 256 deaths were reported today (9 May 2020), up from 10 840 cases and 256 deaths yesterday (8 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 37 consecutive days and below 50 for 30 consecutive days. For several days, the count was below 10 but started climbing over the last 2 days. Of concern is that all but 8 of the newly confirmed cases were locally transmitted. 14 of the 34 newly confirmed cases were in Seoul, and 6 were in Gyeonggi. Other provinces reporting single cases were Busan, Deagu, Incheon Chungbuk and Jeju. Details on the 18 newly confirmed cases are not as yet available to understand whether these were all cluster related or related to the opening up of restrictions on social distancing.

Demographics on the 10 874 cases reported thus far are available on the English language webpage (URL above).

As they move to the next phase -- "distancing in daily life" -- all eyes will be on the country to see whether they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be the main problem at this time.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 218 268 cases, including 30 395 deaths, up from 217 185 cases and 30 201 deaths reported on 8 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 8 and 9 May 2020 was 1083 newly confirmed cases, compared with 1327 newly confirmed cases between 7 and 8 May 2020. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline.

Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 78.6% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 47.8% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Piedmont are the only provinces reporting 100 or more newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Nine provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases, and another 6 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 61 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 60 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 106 220, total cases, 6589 deaths
Date: Sat 9 May 2020
Source: Radio Farda [edited]
https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-still-hiding-covid-death-figures-in-hotspots-320-arrested-for-spreading-rumors-/30603156.html


Iran's health officials say the coronavirus situation in the capital Tehran and Khuzestan Province is still alarming despite fewer deaths from COVID-19, while the police continue suppression of online activities that question official figures. On Saturday [9 May 2020], the commander of police said his forces have identified and dealt with 1300 websites and arrested 320 individuals for "spreading rumors" about the spread of coronavirus on social media.

Many believe that Iranian authorities hid the coronavirus outbreak for political reasons before finally admitting on 19 Feb 2020 that the virus had spread in Qom, Iran's religious capital, and had even killed 2 people.

The number of cases and the death toll published by Iran's Health Ministry have been questioned by the public as well as lawmakers and city councilors.

According to the latest figures released by the Health Ministry, since Fri 8 May 2020, 1529 more cases of COVID-19 have been identified, and 48 more patients have lost their lives in the country. Of these victims, the majority appear to be from Tehran Province, the city of Tehran, and various cities in the south western oil-rich Khuzestan Province.

The Health Ministry only announces the total numbers for the country and refuses to disclose details for individual provinces or the city of Tehran. An advisory report by the research arm of the Iranian parliament on 14 Apr 2020 estimated that the real number of coronavirus cases in the country could be up to 10 times higher than the cases identified by the Health Ministry and the death toll nearly twice the official figure.

The Iranian Health Ministry, however, bases its data on positive RT-PCR tests, the accuracy of which according to the parliament's Research Center is reliable only in 60 to 70 per cent of cases.

The country's highest daily toll, 158 deaths in one single day, was registered on 4 Apr 2020, but the official daily death number has dropped significantly. Deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi, one of the 1st to catch the virus himself, on Sat 9 May 2020 said the decline in cases and deaths is expected to continue in the next 2 months. However, officials in Khuzestan Province, the latest hotspot of the epidemic, say they expect a peak in the coming days.

[In the 24 hours from 8 to 9 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 104 691 to 106 220, an increase of 1529 compared with 1556 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (7 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 6541 to 6589, an increase of 48 deaths in the 24-hour period (as of 9 May 2020 17:03 GMT; Worldometer). In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran now ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Spain, Italy, UK, Russia, France, Germany, Brazil, and Turkey. As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening, and, unfortunately, it appears as though the opening may have been premature. A caution is that there is usually a 2-3 week lag between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths, so relying on the daily number of deaths at this point may be premature as well. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 347 309, including 80 037 deaths, an increase from 1 321 785 cases and 78 615 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 343 409 (25.5%) cumulative case reports and 2704 (10.5%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is still clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing.

Daily reported case counts are high in Illinois (2325- - 9.1% of total), New Jersey (1367 -- 5.4%), California (2580 -- 10.1%), Massachusetts (1410 - 5.5%), Pennsylvania (1215 -- 4.7%), Texas (915 -- 3.5%), and Maryland (1049 -- 4.1%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Texas, and Connecticut.

Repeating from previous days, more sobering, if you treat each state as a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1, followed by Spain, Italy, UK, Russia, France, Germany, Brazil, New Jersey, and Turkey as number 10. Number 11 would be Iran, 12 China, 13 Massachusetts, 14 Illinois, 15 Canada, 16 California, 17 Peru, 18 India, 19 Pennsylvania, and 20 Belgium. Six US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL). Even more sobering is that New York City itself would be between France and Russia (it would be number 6).

The US military has confirmed 7826 cumulative cases, with no newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 10 877 cumulative cases and 211 new cases today (9 May 2020). There have been 3580 cases reported from federal prisons (250 new cases in the past 24 hours) and 2876 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (119 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 2173 cases (17 new cases in the past 24 hours). Other states with increased activity include Ohio with 681 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, Virginia with 854 newly confirmed cases, Minnesota with 702 newly confirmed cases, and Louisiana with 562 newly confirmed cases. 25 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations, and not antibody based tests, to WHO, since 25 Apr 2020. The antibody-confirmed cases are now available in Table 4, which presents all cases including all tests performed. There were 604 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the 24-hour period from 8 to 9 May 2020, bringing the PCR [plus number confirmed including all tests] confirmed cumulative total to 223 578 [262 783] as compared with 223 133 [260 117] confirmed cases on 9 May 2020.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 34.5, a continual slow decrease over the past 28 days from a high of 214.4 on 7 Apr 2020 to 34.51 today (9 May 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times.

Of the 223 578 [262 783] cases, an additional 489 cases have been hospitalized, and an additional 70 cases were admitted to ICU. 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.
