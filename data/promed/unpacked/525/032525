There are concerns over the growing number of health workers infected with COVID-19 across the country. The Director General of Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, in an exclusive interview with Daily Trust on Sunday [9 Aug 2020], said that as of Wednesday [5 Aug 2020], Nigeria recorded 1805 cases of COVID-19 among health workers as at the end of July 2020. Our correspondent gathered that the number of health workers infected grew from 40 in April 2020 to 112 in May 2020, and 812 in June 2020. The health workers include doctors, pharmacists, medical laboratory scientists and technicians, nurses, hygienists, physiotherapists, and radiologists among others. Some of those infected include 29 officials of the NCDC who were infected as of June 2020.

So far 1022 resident doctors have been exposed to COVID-19 across the country. Out of this, 319 tested positive to the disease, 61 recovered, while 14 died from the virus, according to the State of Medical Doctors in Nigerian Health Institutions report released by the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD). Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said Thursday [6 Aug 2020] that about 10 000 health workers had been infected in Africa. The organisation said it had trained more than 50 000 health workers to protect themselves and patients.

The number of infected health workers keeps increasing daily across the states. No fewer than 144 tested positive in Kaduna State in April 2020, according to the Director, Primary Healthcare Development Agency, Dr Iliyasu Neyu. 16 of them are doctors. 102 health workers also tested positive in Nasarawa State. The chairman of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) in the state, Dr Bulus Umaru Peter, told Daily Trust that he and Dr Peter Idoko, the president of the Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) were among those infected. According to him, 77 of those affected were from public hospitals, while 25 were from private hospitals.

Daily Trust on Sun 9 Aug 2020 reports that over 200 doctors in Lagos State have also been infected with COVID-19. 400 nurses and midwives were reportedly exposed, while 30 were confirmed positive. As a result of the large number of health workers infected with COVID-19, the Lagos State government has dedicated an isolation center for the management of health workers. The center, located at Agidingbi in Ikeja, is a 2-story guest house with over 20 rooms on each floor. Dr Wahab Egberongbe, a doctor who survived COVID-19, told our correspondent that as at 4 weeks ago when he left the center, over 60 health workers had been managed in the facility and more were being brought there daily.

In Kano, about 109 health workers including medical doctors and nurses have been infected since the outbreak of the disease in the state in April 2020. The chairman of the state chapter of the NMA, Dr Sanusi Mohammed Bala, said the state had an almost 5 percent rate of infection among medical doctors alone, with 64 positive cases and one death.

In Katsina, 104 health workers have contracted the virus. The state NMA chairman, Dr Nafiu Abdulaziz, said the union had to procure and distribute Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to members to mitigate the infection rate. The chairman of the Medical and Health Workers Union, Munnir Suleiman, said the association was disturbed with the situation and had embarked on the sensitization of members across the 34 local government areas.

In Ogun State, 98 health workers were infected, out of which 3 died. 2 of the dead are doctors. Of the 98, 12 are doctors, while others are nurses and other categories of health workers.

In Sokoto, 24 health workers have been infected, including 19 doctors and 5 nurses. The Secretary of the NMA in the state, Dr Waziri Usman Muhammad and chairman of the National Association of Nigerian Nurses and Midwives (NANNM), Sokoto Abdulmajid Bashir, confirmed the figure for their respective associations. The NMA secretary said at the early stage of COVID-19 in the state, many doctors were affected, but none was infected in the last 2-3 weeks.

The Rivers State chairperson of the NMA, Dr Obelebra Adebiyi, said 22 doctors and 60 health workers were infected with COVID-19 in the state. She said the health workers were exposed to the virus because of inadequate personal protective equipment.

At least 17 health workers including 11 medical doctors and 6 other health workers tested positive to COVID-19 in Benue State. The state chairman of the NMA, Dr Joseph Ngbea, said cases of infection among health workers had increased in the state. "There is an increase in cases among health workers. One of our erudite professors just passed on because of coronavirus. That is Prof Godwin Achinge, a professor of Medicine. A few other doctors are infected, some of them have recovered," he said.

In Bauchi, 73 frontline health workers have been infected with COVID-19 including 14 doctors, 36 nurses and 23 medical and health workers. The chairman of the state branch of NMA, Dr Labaran Dattijo, said the 14 infected doctors who had been discharged work in the 3 isolation centres in the state.

Daily Trust's findings revealed that 57 health workers had been infected with COVID-19 in Plateau State. 10 are doctors while 18 are nurses.

So far, not less than 35 medical doctors have tested positive to coronavirus in Kwara State. Dr Kolade Solagberu, the state chairman of the NMA, said the situation had become very scary.

31 health workers have contracted COVID-19 in Borno State. Dr Abdulhakeem Mamman Ngulde, the NMA Secretary in the state, said no health worker got the virus from the frontlines but from the index case or other contacts.

According to the chairman of Niger State NMA, Dr Abdullahi Jibril, 20 health workers have tested positive to the virus; 9 of them are doctors.

The Kebbi State, chairman of the NMA, Dr Mohammed Bala, told Daily Trust that the 3 medical doctors that contracted COVID-19 in the state had been treated and discharged. Also, the state chairman of the National Association of Nurses and Midwives, Kelani Abdulwaliyu, said that as of June 2020, 42 nurses were exposed to the virus and 7 were confirmed to have contracted the virus.

The Ebonyi State Commissioner for Health, Dr Daniel Umezurike, told Daily Trust that 24 health workers were infected with COVID-19 and had been treated and discharged.

The chairman of NMA in Taraba State, Dr Danga, said none of his members has been infected with coronavirus, but a nurse said that 2 of her colleagues were infected.

Experts said doctors and other health workers got infected while attending to patients. They said they were being infected and dying from the virus as a result of lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE, including garments, helmets, goggles, gloves, and other equipment, is worn to minimize exposure to diseases and other hazards but are in short supply in Nigeria, exposing health workers in both government and private health care centres to danger of contracting infectious diseases. They said other reasons include lack of adherence to safety measures by members of the public, who then fall ill and go to hospitals, with some of them hiding the true nature of their ailments thereby exposing health workers to the virus. The experts said it was important for health personnel to be trained on disease infection, prevention and control. They also called on government to boost the morale of health workers with adequate PPE, incentives, allowances, and life insurance.

According to Dr Ckiwe Iheakweazu of the NCDC, there are various occupational risks that health workers face, as they respond to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. He said some of these are late recognition or suspicion of COVID-19 in patients, sub-optimal adherence to infection prevention and control measures such as hand hygiene practices and lack of or improper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). He said: "This situation is not specific to Nigeria alone. In Ghana, over 2000 health workers tested positive for COVID-19 according to the Ghana Health Service as at 16 Jul 2020. In Spain, about 6500 health workers infections were reported in March 2020. Unfortunately, this pandemic has really affected our frontline workers. We continue to work closely with the Department of Hospital Services of the Federal Ministry of Health to ensure that health workers are provided adequate PPE for their safety. We have also carried out training on infection prevention control (IPC) for health workers across the country. In addition, we developed an online IPC course to ensure this is accessible to health workers."

The Lagos State Chairman of the NMA, Dr Adenekan Tunji, said health workers need lots of PPE because they are constantly exposed. Dr Wahab Egberongbe, who survived COVID-19, attributed the increase in number of infected health workers to the unavailability of PPEs in some places and only a few in others. "Few health workers are going for tests because many of them are asymptomatic. After I returned, some colleagues shared their symptoms, which were similar to mine, but they never went to the isolation center and they recovered," he said.

A doctor who works with the Kwara State government and craves anonymity said many of the medical personnel were exposed to the virus while treating those supposedly having malaria. He said, "The situation is bad now because each of those 35 infected medical personnel has at least 10 new contacts. You can do the arithmetic. ...." The chairman, NMA in Kano State, Dr Sanusi Mohammed Bala, said the infections were high in Kano during the peak period from mid-April to May 2020 because of lack of PPE in hospitals and COVID-19 treatment and test centers.

Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire He, however, noted that the trend had changed since May 2020, a sequel to the federal government's intervention through provision of adequate PPE. "There are 3 different factors that influenced the situation. The major reason in one centre was lack of protective equipment at that time. The other centre was because one doctor got infected and wasn't diagnosed early, so he kept interacting with other colleagues, and that was how they developed the disease. In another centre, it was because the arrangement or the set up was not properly placed, so you cannot easily separate who was infected from who was not infected, they interacted with the doctors, and they (the doctors) also got infected."

The chairperson of the NMA in Rivers State, Dr Obelebra Adebiyi, also said health workers were exposed to the virus because of inadequate PPEs. A nurse in one of the treatment centres also told our reporter that the number of health workers infected was on the increase because of lack of PPEs. The chairman of the NMA in Kwara State, Dr Ismail Lawal, said the state government could only reciprocate efforts of health workers by improving their welfare packages, providing PPEs and enrolling them in insurance schemes. Dr Titus Dajel, the state chairman of NMA Plateau, said the workers were affected as a result of the nature of the Nigerian health system which lacks a Community Ambulance System for people to use as their first point of call before arriving at hospitals. According to the chairman, patients arrived hospitals without health workers having prior knowledge of their background. He said government should make protective equipment available for primary and general hospitals as well as a supporting systems for those in private practice. He said people should also adhere to the government's safety measures.

The president, Association of Resident Doctors, Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, Dr Ebidimie-Divine Irole, appealed to the state's COVID-19 task force to ensure adequate supply of PPEs to its members to prevent infection of health workers. Dr Irole said with the recent upsurge in the spread of the coronavirus in the state, the state government should protect those battling to save lives by motivating them. "We are still waiting for the implementation of the hazard allowance as announced by the federal government, we are very optimistic and hope that the state government extends the gesture to our counterparts at the state level," she said.

When contacted, the chairman, Bauchi State branch of the NMA, Dr Labaran Dattijo, said the NMA had made frantic efforts insisting that doctors must be trained on handling COVID-19 patients, and provision of PPEs. "Our contributions have yielded positive results because the state government in collaboration with World Health Organization (WHO) and Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) carried out series of trainings of frontline health workers, and all infections of our members happened in April 2020, since then, no medical doctor was infected again." He added the state government had encouraged frontline health workers, especially doctors by giving them N30 000 and N50 000 [USD 79-132] weekly with pledges of health insurance.

The Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, said health workers need to maintain a high index of suspicion of COVID-19 when they attend to patients to prevent getting infected. While applauding health workers on the frontlines, he said government would continue to provide them the necessary equipment. "Frontline health workers must undertake refresher courses on Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC) at intervals, remain vigilant in the line of duty and maintain a high index of suspicion for COVID-19," he said.

The Minister of State for Health, Dr Olorunnimbe Mamora, during his recent meeting with chief medical directors of public hospitals, reiterated the need for health workers to be educated on the consciousness of infection, prevention and control to further limit or eliminate infections. On the way out, Dr Ihekeazu said it was important to note that health workers are also part of the community. "They travel home and interact with people in situations where the virus can be transmitted. While most infections may be from healthcare settings, some are outside the hospital," he said. He urged all health workers to practice standard care precautions, adding; "Health workers should maintain the required distance where possible and wear appropriate PPEs while attending to any patient, irrespective of condition of the patient."

The chairman, Niger State NMA, Dr Abdullahi Jibril, reiterated the need for people to take responsibility by following all protocols laid down by health personnel to stop community spread of the virus. He, however, added that the face shields people are using do not help in preventing the spread of the virus, saying people should wear face masks, wash hands regularly with soap and water, and use hand sanitizers.

[The ongoing coronavirus disease outbreak in Nigeria has so far affected 1805 health workers.

The report above looks at the numbers and cadres of health workers across the country. There has been increased attention to training and retraining of health workers on infection prevention and control, which is key to preventing infection. In addition, there is a shortage of supplies of personal protective equipment, which needs to be used properly to prevent infection. - Mod.AA

A common denominator in many countries has been a shortage of PPE when the surge occurred. It seems as though Nigeria suffered from similar issues, although it also sounds like healthcare workers may have been in denial and continued working during their own early stages of illness, contributing to nosocomial spread of the virus, potentially among colleagues. That being said, using the 9 Aug 2020 cumulative case count for Nigeria from the Worldometer files, the figure 1805 represents 3.9% of all reported cases in Nigeria. - Mod.MPP

[2] UK: lockdown impact on viral diseases
Date: Mon 10 Aug 2020
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/10/lockdown-england-reduced-flu-colds-bronchitis-coronavirus


Lockdown and physical distancing measures have helped reduce the incidence of flu, colds, bronchitis, and a host of viruses other than COVID-19 in England, monitoring suggests. The low incidence of these and other viral infections, including laryngitis and tonsillitis, has helped relieve pressure on the NHS when resources have been dedicated to fighting the coronavirus pandemic. The flipside, however, is that as lockdown eases it is not just cases of COVID-19 that may increase.

Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: "We would expect to see a drop in influenza-like illness during the warmer months but the latest figures from our research and surveillance centre (RSC), which collects data from more than 500 GP practices in England, shows that it's lower than the 5-year average for this time of year. "The social distancing measures we have seen over the last few months and an increased public emphasis on maintaining good hygiene have probably played their part, but we also know that some patients have been reluctant to use the NHS during COVID-19 because they haven't wanted to overburden services at a time of crisis or are afraid of catching the virus."

He added that, as lockdown measures eased, "the number of people seeking medical assistance from their GP is returning to normal, and we have started to see rates of illnesses such as the common cold increasing". This highlighted the importance of maintaining good hygiene measures to protect not only against COVID-19 but also other common winter illnesses with preparations under way for a second wave, he said.

The RSC data shows infection rates for many viruses plummeted at around the time the government introduced lockdown measures in March [2020]. Chickenpox and measles fell off sharply when schools and nurseries closed.

Keith Neal, an emeritus professor in the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said there were reasons to be optimistic about this winter. "Even if we reduce social distancing by only 10% and we have done a lot more than that, then you would expect 10% less transmission of coughs and colds," he said. "It's impossible to say exactly what is going to happen. If people don't mix as much you will expect less of these coughs and cold type of minor illnesses. We're already seeing in Australia, which is in their winter, that they are having very little flu compared to previous years."

Neal said the push to get more people vaccinated should also help suppress the flu virus. "I would be surprised if we get a worse winter for flu. It means social distancing has failed," he said. "The only caveat to that is if a brand new flu virus appears, which is not in the vaccine. There's no signs of that happening at the moment and with less flu viruses circulating in the southern hemisphere, there's less chance of a mutation occurring because there's less viruses to mutate."

The RSC data shows infection rates for most viruses had been running below the respective 5-year average anyway but a drop in cases related to lockdown meant an ever bigger fall.

Some virus infection rates, however, had crept above the respective 5-year average. The infection rate for flu was above the average in the week beginning [9 Mar 2020] -- full lockdown began on [23 Mar 2020] -- and measles was above the average in the week beginning [23 Mar 2020], just as schools were closed.

[We have previously posted on the noted decline in influenza in the Southern Hemisphere (see COVID-19 update (331): Southern hemisphere influenza, WHO, global 20200725.7610135). It is interesting to see the impact noted in the northern hemisphere in terms of other viral diseases. It seems logical that with reduced contact with others, disease transmission would naturally be reduced. But, as mentioned in the media report, a key question is how much of the reduction in cases is related to avoidance of the health sector vs how much is related to reduced contact, increased hand washing, masks, and social distancing? It will be interesting to see analyses that are able to tease this out.

Of interest is the Eurosurveillance commentary on the probable impact of the lockdown on vaccination uptakes, leading to reduced vaccination coverages. With potential opening up of schools and day care centers, this impact may lead to larger outbreaks as the unvaccinated children congregate in these settings (see Measles update (19): Africa (Somalia, Jubaland State); comment 20200811.7668045) for this commentary and Mod.LK's astute comment on this. - Mod.MPP]

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. Spain has been added again, as it is dealing with a 2nd wave after lifting of restrictions, primarily focused in Catalonia and Aragon. - Mod.MPP]

Japan and Australia continue with elevated transmission.

- The South East Asia region reported 26.4% of the global newly reported cases and 19.4% of global deaths. India reported 92.7% (62 064) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 3.7% (2487), and Indonesia 2.8% (1893). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same, even with weekend reporting artifact. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries that have resurgences of cases associated with lifting of restrictions.

[Note: there is weekend artifact in daily reported cases as some key surge countries in Latin America have not reported any cases today [10 Aug 2020]. Peru, Bolivia, Honduras, and Venezuela and there are still reduced reports from some states in Brazil and the USA.

Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (9 Aug 2020), the global case count rose by 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (53 016), followed by USA (52 002), and Brazil (21 888) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (52.2%). There were 4610 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by USA, Brazil, Colombia, Spain, Argentina, Philippines, Mexico, Russia, and France. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 4854 to 53 016. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: South Africa, Iraq, Bangladesh, Iran, Chile, Israel, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Germany, and Japan; their range of reported new cases is 1207 to 3739.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is virtually no change (a decrease of 0.12%,) and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is increased by 1.8%. The key question still remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether this is a reporting artifact. Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (I haven't changed my mind!).

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; albeit, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing. For example, the USA reported data suggests a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases and deaths (see section [3E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 2 weeks the positivity rate is 9%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html). The most severely affected region is the Americas, with cases increasing daily, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
