Novalgin therapy of Hemorrhagic Fevers
--------------------------------------
Treatment with Novalgin (Metamizol, Antipyrin) was described to be of use
in patients with Marburg virus disease already in 1971 by Martini (GA.
Martini 1971: "Marburg virus Disease, Clinical Syndrome" in G.A. Martini
and R. Siegert, eds: "Marburg Virus Disease" Springer Verlag, Berlin,
Heidelberg, New York 1971, p 9.) Novalgin therapy may cause an
agranulocytosis in rare cases, which can however be successfully treated
with CSF [Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is G-CSF, one of the colony
stimulating factors that has been used to treat neutropenia. - Man. Ed.
DS. Novalgin therapy may be beneficial because it combines central and
peripheral nociceptive activities. In the periphery the synthesis of
thromboxane is inhibited probably in addition to other mechanisms of
action. It is not known, whether or not Novalgin might be of use in cases
of fully developed haemorrhagic fever but it might be helpful in preventing
the development of a DIC [disseminated intravascular coagulation in early
cases because it inhibits thrombocyte aggregation. As compared with
AT3-therapy [presumably antithrombin 3, treatment with Novalgin might be
more affordable. There is no problem of its application because it is
licensed for medical use.
