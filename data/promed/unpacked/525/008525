With 8 more deaths reported in the past 36 hours, the cumulative death
toll due to encephalitis in eastern Uttar Pradesh has risen to 376
this year [2011]. Of the persons who have succumbed to the disease, 4
are from Kushinagar and one each from Mahrajganj, Deoria, Basti, and
Gorakhpur districts, said Diwakar Prasad, additional director health,
Gorakhpur division. They were undergoing treatment at BRD Medical
College Hospital [MCH] in Gorakhpur and other government hospitals in
adjacent districts, he said.

According to data available, as many as 44 patients have succumbed to
various kinds of encephalitis in the region in the past 10 days.
Prasad said that out of 2480 encephalitis patients admitted in the
government hospitals in the region this year, 376 have succumbed to
the disease. At present, 321 encephalitis patients are undergoing
treatment at BRD Medical College and hospitals in adjacent districts.
43 fresh patients of encephalitis have been admitted in BRD MCH and
district hospitals of the region during the past 36 hours, Prasad
said. Experts say 2 mainly kinds of encephalitis [viruses] are
prevailing in the region -- Japanese encephalitis, which is caused by
mosquito bite, while the other type of encephalitis occurs due to
consumption of unsafe drinking water. Both are vector borne diseases,
they said.

[The encephalitis cases continue to appear in Uttar Pradesh, and the
etiologies of all of them remain unclear. There is no indication in
the report above of the proportion of the 2480 encephalitis cases that
are due to Japanese encephalitis virus infections, or the specific
viruses responsible for the remaining cases. The report indicates that
some of these cases are due to consumption of contaminated drinking
water, suggesting enterovirus infection, but adds further confusion by
stating that these are vector-borne. ProMED-mail would be interested
in learning about which specific viruses are involved in those cases
not due to Japanese encephalitis virus.
