I would like you to give a follow-up of the clinical course of the Mecca
patient I recently described.
All possible serological tests including respiratory viruses, atypical
respiratoy pathogens, _Legionella_, Hantaviruses and
vasculitis/auto-immuune diseases were negative. But, the antibody titer for
Influenza A is found to be very high. Although we could not find the
association of acute renal failure (acute interstitial nephritis) and
Influenza A in the literature, this is still a very good possibility.
In fact, many infections can cause acute interstitial nephritis.
We performed yesterday, 6 Apr [2000, a renal biopsy. Results are expected
this afternoon. The patient is still in the ICU and on the ventilator. He
still is dialysis dependent and anuric.
His pulmonary condition is now again deteriorated because of nosocomial
pneumonia during ventilation.
The other patient I mentioned, who is still admitted on the ICU in another
Amsterdam hospital, is also still on the ventilator and dialysis dependent.
We will perform serological tests on Influenza A in this patient too.

I promised you the results of yesterday's renal biopsy. This showed an
completely unexpected diagnosis:
End-stage kidney, caused by amyloid (type AA). This mean that the original
hypothesis of acute renal failure was wrong.
This patient was already suffering from a pre-terminal or terminal renal
failure, when he went to Mecca. We now conclude that the finding of renal
failure in this patient is co-morbidity and not directly linked to his
Influenza A pneumonia/pneumonitis with secondary bacterial superinfection.
The cause of his AA-amyloid will need further analysis.
