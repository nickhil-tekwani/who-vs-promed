Chikungunya, a viral infection which causes body and joint pains, has hit
Pondicherry with one 12-year-old boy from Kunichempet being admitted to the
Manakkula Vinayagar Medical College Hospital here after he was reportedly
affected.
It is said the infectious disease was first 'imported' by a resident of
Mylam near Villupuram after he returned from Bangalore. Following this, 34
persons from the village were infected and admitted to the government
hospital at Villupuram.
Based on media reports saying that 11 000 persons in 17 districts were
affected by the disease in Tamilnadu, the people in Pondicherry are
anxiously expecting swift action from Pondicherry Chief Minister N
Rangasamy and Health Minister E Valsaraj to safeguard them from the viral
infection.

About 11 000 people in 17 districts in the State are affected by
chikungunya but there is no cause for alarm as urgent steps are being taken
to contain the disease, said Health Minister K.K.S.S.R. Ramachandran here
on Wednesday.
Talking to newsmen, the Minister said 208 medical teams with 10 000
personnel were sent to the affected districts and they were working round
the clock. In the rest of the 12 districts, preventive measures were being
taken up in full swing. So far there was not a single death due to the
disease. Unfortunately there was no preventive vaccine for the disease.
The disease, [transmitted] mainly by mosquitoes, had spread from Andhra
Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra, where more than 500 000 people were
affected in the last year. People from Tamil Nadu who visited those States
might have carried the virus and spread it to people here. Symptoms of the
disease were fever along with body and joint aches, which would last for
4-5 days.
The Minister said blood samples collected from 229 affected people were
sent to the National Virus Laboratory, Pune. The results tested positive in
27 cases. As mosquitoes bred in stagnant water were the carriers of the
disease, people were advised to avoid water stagnation in their areas. The
Government had also formed rapid response teams in districts, which would
rush to villages on hearing any case of the disease and would suitably
advise the primary health centre concerned.
The Minister said steps were being taken to fill all vacancies in
government hospitals. About 1500 doctors had already been selected by the
Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission and they would get postings soon. The
Government would take a decision on regularising the services of 1700
doctors, appointed on contract basis by the previous Government. Similarly,
2500 nurse vacancies would also be filled and the pending promotion list
would be released soon.
