Influenza activity has returned to "out of season" levels in most
countries of the WHO European Region
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
- This issue is based on data reported in week 16/2011 [18-24 Apr
2011] by 45 [of the 53] Member States in the WHO European Region.

- Consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute
respiratory infection (ARI) activity are below baseline thresholds or
at pre-season levels in most countries.

- Hospitalizations for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI)
continue to decline in most countries with sentinel hospital-based
surveillance for SARI.

- 5 percent of sentinel specimens from patients with ILI or ARI, and
3 percent of specimens from sentinel SARI patients, tested positive
for influenza.

Current situation -- week 16/2011 [18-24 Apr 2011]
--------------------------------------------------
During week 16/2011 [18-24 Apr 2011], 35 countries reported low
intensity of respiratory-disease activity and 2 (Armenia and the
Russian Federation), medium intensity. ILI or ARI consultation rates
have returned to pre-season levels or are below the national baseline
thresholds in all but one (Azerbaijan) of the 36 countries reporting
epidemiological data this week. Among the 37 countries reporting on
the geographical spread of influenza, 35 reported no or sporadic
activity. Armenia reported local spread, and Georgia, regional spread.
The impact of influenza on health care systems was low in all but one
(Armenia) of the 20 countries reporting on this indicator.

Data on sentinel hospital-based surveillance for SARI were reported
in 10 countries: Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Malta, the
Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, and
Ukraine. SARI hospitalizations are declining overall and are back to
pre-season levels in Kazakhstan, Romania, Serbia, and Ukraine. In
Georgia, SARI hospitalizations have increased over the last 3 weeks;
this is driven by increases in hospitalizations in the group aged 0 to
4, however, and no sentinel SARI specimens tested positive for
influenza in the country during week 16. Further information on the
sentinel SARI surveillance systems represented in the EuroFlu bulletin
can be found in the "Overview of sentinel SARI systems in EuroFlu"
[http://www.euroflu.org/documents/EuroFlu_Overview_of_SARI_Surveillance_Systems.pdf].

Virological situation -- week 16/2011 [18-24 Apr 2011]
------------------------------------------------------
Influenza B virus was dominant in 3 countries, and co-dominant with
pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 in 2 others. Ukraine reported pandemic
influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus to be dominant.

Sentinel physicians collected 162 respiratory specimens, of which 8
(5 percent) were positive for influenza virus: 3 (38 percent) were
influenza A and 5 (62 percent) were influenza B. 2 of the 3 influenza
A viruses were subtyped: both were pandemic A(H1). In the 2 countries
testing 20 or more sentinel specimens, influenza positivity ranged
from 3 percent to 5 percent. In addition, 140 non-sentinel specimens
were reported positive for influenza: 63 (45 percent) influenza A and
77 (55 percent) influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 54 were
subtyped: 51 (94 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 3 (6 percent) as
A(H3).

Sentinel hospitals participating in SARI surveillance in 10 countries
collected 64 specimens from SARI patients of which 2 (3 percent) were
positive for influenza.

Cumulative virological update -- weeks 40/2010-16/2011 [4 Oct 2010-24
Apr 2011]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 77 462 influenza virus detections was reported during this
period, of which 54 949 (71 percent) were influenza A and 22 513 (29
percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 46 281 were
subtyped: 44 542 (96 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 1739 (4 percent)
as A(H3).

>From week 40/2010 through week 16/2011 [18-24 Apr 2011], 1533 out of
5525 sentinel SARI specimens (28 percent) tested positive for
influenza: 872 (57 percent) were influenza A and 661 (43 percent)
influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 691 were subtyped: 638 (92
percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 53 (8 percent) as influenza A(H3).

Since week 40/2010, 4515 influenza viruses have been characterized
antigenically: 2329 were A(H1) pandemic A/California/7/2009
(H1N1)-like; 1860 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria/2/87
lineage); 151 were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like; 173 were
B/Florida/4/2006-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage); and 2 were
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). Based on the
genetic characterization of 585 influenza viruses, 166 belonged to the
pandemic A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1) clade; 10 belonged to the
pandemic A/Christchurch/16/2010 A(H1) clade; 46 belonged to the
pandemic A/Hong Kong/2213/2010 A(H1) clade; 136 belonged to the
recently emerged A/England/142/2010 subgroup characterized by S185T
substitution in the HA; 12 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by
A/Perth/16/2009; 5 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by
A/Victoria/208/2009; 29 belonged to the subgroup represented by A/Hong
Kong/2121/2010 in the A/Victoria/208/2009 A(H3) clade; 20 belonged to
the B/Bangladesh/3333/2007 clade (Yamagata lineage); and 161 to the
B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (Victoria lineage).

Since week 40/2010, 9 countries (Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK) have screened
3519 viruses for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors
oseltamivir and zanamivir. The UK analysed most of the viruses
screened (1672). Of the 3164 pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses that were
tested, 3072 were sensitive to both inhibitors and 92 viruses (2.9
percent) carried the NA H275Y mutation. These 92 viruses were
resistant to oseltamivir but remained sensitive to zanamivir. 9
influenza A(H3N2) viruses were tested and found to be sensitive to
both inhibitors. All of the 346 influenza B viruses tested for
susceptibility to oseltamivir and the 340 tested for susceptibility to
zanamivir were found to be sensitive. All 197 pandemic influenza
A(H1N1) 2009 viruses and 10 A(H3N2) viruses that were screened for
susceptibility to adamantanes were found to be resistant.

Comment
-------
Influenza activity has returned to pre-season levels in most
countries across the WHO European Region. At present, a very low
percentage (less than 5 percent) of sentinel ILI/ARI and SARI
specimens is testing positive for influenza.

[In brief: influenza has returned to pre-seasonal levels throughout
most of Europe. During the course of the epidemic 3 (possibly 4)
distinct clades of influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus, 3 of influenza A (H3)
virus, and 2 of influenza B virus have been recognised. Which of these
clades will predominate in any subsequent outbreak cannot be predicted
at this stage.

The EuroFlu website features an interactive map presenting
qualitative indicators of influenza activity (intensity, trend,
geographical spread, and impact) and the dominant virus as assessed by
each of the countries. This information can be accessed by clicking on
the individual countries in the map and readers are recommended to
make use of this facility. In addition, clicking on France, the
Russian Federation, Turkey, and UK (England) will provide regional
data for these countries. - Mod.CP]
