NEUROLOGIC DISORDER - AUSTRALIA: RFI
====================================
[Moderator: The following request arrived at my computer when I was on a
field trip and am only now able to post it. I apologize for the delay but
hope that someone reading ProMED will be able to contact ProMED or Dr. Plant
with useful information or ideas.]
Message: "I am looking for some help for a good friend and collaborator who
has been hit by a disorder which remains undiagnosed and [unsuccessfully]
treated, even symptomatically.
My colleague is a previously well, fit 35-year old, married, 2 small
children, also an MD with a PhD in epidemiology and who lives in Sydney. She
is a stoic, non-complaining woman who previously swam 1-2 km per day. About
10-11 weeks ago she presented with what appeared to be both back and hip
pain. She had localised spasm in her lower back but also was actually tender
over her R hip joint. She went to a local doctor who subsequently referred
her to an orthopaedic surgeon. He quickly realised he was not dealing with
an orthopaedic problem and referred her to a neurologist. At about this time
she developed R foot drop, and dysasthesia in (as I recall) the L5
distribution.
Her back/hip remained incredibly painful and she was commenced on narcotic
analgesics. Her pain is worse at night. She is using 24 hour hot packs to
relieve the spasm, and they have fiddled with a great collection of narcotics
and various drugs to attempt pain control.
Her R foot slowly improved only [to have] her L foot drop; then her R foot
deteriorated again. She complains of the foot drop before the pain seems to
worsen. Any kind of stimulus seems to make the pain worse, e.g., another
detailed examination by a neurologist. First one lower leg wasted then the
other but I suppose that is a direct result of not being able to move them.
So far she has seen the orthopaedic surgeon, 3-4 neurologists, a
rheumatologist. The working diagnosis is a "viral plexopathy/radiculopathy"
She has had CAT scans, two MRIs, lumbar puncture (not done till several weeks
into the history), full blood picture, ESR, standard blood tests, etc. All
[have been reported as] normal.
The only postive result has been the isolation of Coxsackie B2 virus from
faeces. This virus was isolated about 10 days after the main onset of pain.
It seems to me that she has now been hospitalised for 9-10 weeks. Every
minute of every day has been spent in incredible pain. As she says (she
maintains a sense of humour), "Dogs get put down for far less!"
My search of the literature has not been helpful, though to me it sounds like
an immunological response, perhaps akin to a Guillain-Barre type of pain
response.
I would be grateful if you could think about this and pass this note to
anyone that might be able to help my colleague. I have not been able to
track down a neurology bulletin board on the Web but maybe we should be
thinking more broadly than neurology. My friend is getting desperate and has
reached the stage where she doesn't care about the diagnosis, she just wants
pain relief.
Thanks,
Aileen Plant"
