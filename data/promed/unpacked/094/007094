[1] SARS-CoV2 Persistence on inert surfaces
Date: 5 Dec 2020
Source: Env Res [edited]

Abstract
Undoubtedly, there is a tremendous concern regarding the new viral strain "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2" (SARS-CoV-2) and its related disease known as COVID-19. The World Health Organization has stated that SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted from person-to-person close contact, as well as by small aerosol respiratory droplets. Moreover, the results of some recent studies about the role of air pollution on the spread and lethality of the novel coronavirus suggest that air contaminants could also be a transmission pathway of the virus. On the other hand, indirect transmission of the virus cannot be discarded. Among many sources of indirect transmission, there is the contamination of inert/inanimate surfaces.

This manuscript was aimed at reviewing the scientific literature currently available in PubMed and Scopus. The results of the reviewed studies point out that SARS-CoV-2 can last on different surfaces from hours to a few days. However, rapid SARS-CoV-2 inactivation is possible by applying commonly available chemicals and biocides on inanimate surfaces. Consequently, although the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on inanimate surfaces can represent a potential route of transmission, appropriate disinfection measures should reduce the possibilities of transmission of the coronavirus, and hence, significantly decrease the risks of COVID-19.

[Most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as coronaviruses, influenza, SARS-CoV, or rhinovirus, can persist on inanimate surfaces for variable periods, from minutes to up to one month, depending on environmental conditions. Factors influencing the survival of these viruses on surfaces include strain variation, titre, surface type, suspending medium, mode of deposition, temperature and relative humidity, and the method used to determine the viability of the virus.

As reported by Otter et al, environmental sampling has identified contamination in field-settings with SARS-CoV and influenza virus, although the frequent use of molecular detection methods may not necessarily represent the presence of viable virus [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26597631/].

The importance of indirect contact transmission (involving contamination of inanimate surfaces) is uncertain compared with other transmission routes, principally direct contact transmission (independent of surface contamination), droplet, and airborne routes. However, SARS-CoV2 can be shed into the environment and be transferred from environmental surfaces to hands of patients and healthcare providers.

Infection prevention and control should be implemented at health care settings, including hand hygiene and personal protective equipment to minimize self-contamination and to protect against self-inoculation of mucosal surfaces and the respiratory tract. In addition, application of enhanced surface cleaning with use of disinfectants for decontamination of possibly exposed surfaces is recommended. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Multiplex, Antibody detection Assay against SARS-CoV-2 Proteins
Date: 2 Dec 2020
Source: Transplantation [edited]
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/publication/33273320


Background:
Transplant recipients who develop COVID-19 may be at increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Determining the status of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in both candidates and recipients will be important to understand the epidemiology and clinical course of COVID-19 in this population. While there are multiple tests to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, their performance is variable. Tests vary according to their platforms and the antigenic targets, which makes interpretation of the results challenging. Furthermore, for some assays, sensitivity and specificity is less than optimal. Additionally, currently available serological tests do not exclude the possibility that positive responses are due to cross reactive antibodies to community coronaviruses rather than SARS-CoV-2.

Methods:
This study describes the development and validation of a high throughput multiplex antibody detection assay.

Results:
The multiplex assay has the capacity to identify, simultaneously, patient responses to 5 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, namely, the full spike protein, 3 individual domains of the spike protein (S1, S2 and receptor binding domain) and the nucleocapsid protein. The antibody response to the above proteins is SARS-CoV-2 specific, as antibodies against 4 common coronaviruses do not cross-react.

Conclusions: This new assay provides a novel tool to interrogate the spectrum of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and is uniquely suitable for use in the transplant setting. Test configuration is essentially identical to the single antigen bead assays used in the majority of histocompatibility laboratories around the world and could easily be implemented into routine screening of transplant candidates and recipients.

[The above report is specific to transplant recipients, yet the findings can be projected to understand application of antibody assays with multiple targets, which can be useful for immunocompromised individuals in general. The assay targets multiple viral proteins, with limited to no cross-reactivity against other coronaviruses, and is based on a well-documented bead-based principle. It may prove helpful in evaluating SARS-CoV2-specific immune responses.

Whether finding an antibody response to certain viral proteins is an indicator of protective immunity is still an open question. - Mod.UBA]

[3] Inflammatory-Related Clinical and Metabolic Outcomes
Date: 5 Dec 2020
Source: LitCovid [edited]
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/publication/33273888


Background:
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) infection elicits inflammatory manifestations that relate with a "cytokine storm."

Objective:
The aim of this research was to assess the role of circulating interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels and other inflammatory markers in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on metabolic functions and accompanying clinical complications.

Patients and Methods:
A total of 165 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia were examined for medical features and inflammatory markers such as blood IL-6, CRP, ferritin, LDH, neutrophil/lymphocyte index (NLI), D-Dimer, and Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW). Regression analyses concerning electronically collected medical data were adjusted by appropriate factors and confounding variables.

Results:
Plasma IL-6 determinations evidenced a consistent association with hospital stay days, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality rates. Similar trends were found for other proinflammatory variables, where ferritin and NLI showed a remarkable value as surrogates. Hyperglycaemia and the Charlson Comorbidity Index Score were positively associated with the inflammatory response induced by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. An unhealthy lifestyle such as smoking and alcoholic drinks consumption as well as excessive body adiposity influenced inflammatory-related outcomes in the screened patients.

Conclusion:
IL-6 together with other inflammatory biomarkers accompanied poor clinical and metabolic outcomes in COVID-19-infected patients. IL-6 may result in a suitable proxy to individually categorise patients in order to manage this infectious pandemic.

[For COVID-19 and all other infectious diseases, metabolic processes are intimately connected to the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and the resulting pathology and pathophysiology, as well as the host defense response to the infection. Here, I examine the relationship between metabolism and COVID-19. The pathologies seen in patients with COVID-19 are not necessarily new among infectious diseases. The sequelae that ensue may include extreme clotting and multiorgan damage and can be consequences of a diverse array of infectious conditions that progress to critical stages. Because COVID-19 is a multisystem condition, understanding the disease course and the process to recovery and rehabilitation in infectious disease survivors is also essential.

In a review on clinical course of COVID-19, Ayres et al. have described 4 stages in the clinical course for symptomatic individuals. Stage 1 begins when an individual becomes symptomatic. Individuals typically develop a dry cough and fever, and they may lose their senses of taste and smell and feel general malaise. For most people, with adequate self-care, the infection is limited to this stage. Stage 2 describes the pulmonary phase of the infection. People who enter this stage develop pulmonary inflammation and pneumonia, either without hypoxia (stage 2a) or with hypoxia (stage 2b). These people require hospitalization. Patients with prolonged hypoxia tend to require mechanical ventilation. Patients can then progress to stage 3. These patients are in critical condition and can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS and extrapulmonary systemic hyperinflammation syndrome). In addition, they can develop shock, vasoplegia [vasodilation and loss of systemic vascular resistance], respiratory failure, cardiopulmonary collapse, myocarditis, acute kidney injury, and other extrapulmonary complications. The prognosis for these patients is poor, and some continue to decline toward mortality, whereas the others enter stage 4, the recovery stage, and survive and exhibit a resilience-of-health phenotype [https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-020-0237-2].

A meta-analysis of 16 studies by Zeng et al on association of a series of inflammatory markers with the severity of COVID-19 (https://www.sciencedirect.com /science/article/pii /S1201971220303623) reported that patients with COVID-19 in the non-severe group had lower levels for CRP (C-Reactive Protein), PCT (Procalcitonin), IL-6, ESR, SAA (Serum amyloid A) and serum ferritin when compared with those in the severe group. Moreover, survivors had a lower level of IL-6 than non-survivors.

This meta-analysis highlights the association of inflammatory markers with the severity of COVID-19. Additional studies on evaluation of important inflammatory markers can assist clinicians in monitoring and evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. - Mod.UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added as yet)].

Data by country, area, or territory for 5 Dec 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesDEC5_1607248970.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 48.9% of daily case numbers and 39.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 27.7 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Canada. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Peru, Chile, Panama, and Costa Rica. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Paraguay, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Guatemala, Honduras, and Puerto Rico.

- The European region reported 36.1% of daily case numbers and 46.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 19.7 million. Countries not reporting cases today (5 Dec 2020) include Israel, and Kazakhstan. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Italy, Russia, Germany, UK, Poland and Ukraine. There are 23 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.2% of daily case numbers and 5.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.25 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Morocco, Pakistan, Jordan, Palestinian Authority, Iraq, Tunisia, Lebanon, and the UAE. Libya reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Sudan, Yemen, Oman and Somalia have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.5% of daily case numbers and 1.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.53 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Kenya, Algeria, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Angola, and Benin.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.85% of daily case numbers and 0.92% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.90 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, French Polynesia, and Guam.

- The South East Asia region reported 7.5% of the daily newly reported cases and 5.8% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 11.02 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: Basically, unchanged on the regional levels, with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 80% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. At the country level, Malaysia has overtaken Japan as the dominant country in the Western Pacific region; Italy maintains dominance in the European region, although France has the highest cumulative case count. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 5 Dec 2020, is an excellent visual representation of the pandemic. - Mod.UBA]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (208 790), Brazil (42 226), and India (36 111) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 10 146 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (4-5 Dec 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (13 countries) include the USA, Brazil, India, Turkey (31 896), Russia (28 782), Italy (21052), Germany (17 812), UK (15 539), Ukraine (13 825), France (12 923), Poland (12 430), Iran (12 151), and Mexico (12 127). A total of 56 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 31 of the 56 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 2 are from the Western Pacific region, and one from the African region. Many countries did not report case numbers for the last 24 hours, most likely a weekend drop in reporting.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 5.2%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 6.2%.

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase with over 600 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission. - Mod.UBA]
