Dengue's untimely comeback catches health authorities unprepared
----------------------------------------------------------------
Dengue has struck rather belatedly and unexpectedly. At a time when people
began to feel that the dreaded fever would spare them at least for this
season, there is bad news from hospitals. More than 100 people have already
contracted the disease. Experts have said the late and sporadic rain which
the country experienced this year helped the breeding of the _Aedes_
mosquito, the deadly carrier of the disease.
When the disease did not break out in July, the usual time for it, a kind
of complacency set in among people that it might not return. Now the
reality is that dengue has staged a comeback. Though no fatality has been
reported so far, the reports say some of the patients are suffering from
the life-threatening type of the disease, the symptoms of which include
unbearable pain and bleeding.
The doctors have pointed out time and again that there is no reason to be
panicked, since the self-limiting disease usually subsides if the patient
is kept under proper medical care for about a week. But the deaths that
occurred in the last few years showed what could happen in the absence of
appropriate medical intervention.
