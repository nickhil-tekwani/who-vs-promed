Infant formula product recalled
-------------------------------
The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) today [Fri 21 Jan 2005] advised
hospitals and pharmacies that may still have stocks of the infant formula
Pregestimil to immediately remove it from use. Pregestimil is a specialist
milk formula for premature infants. At the end of 1 Dec 2004, a number of
batches were associated with serious illness, which triggered a global
voluntary product recall of all batches of Pregestimil by manufacturers
Mead Johnson Nutritionals.
Although the implicated batches were not distributed in Ireland, it has
come to the attention of the FSAI that limited quantities of the formula
could be still available in some hospitals and/or pharmacies. The company
has confirmed to the FSAI that the implicated batches of the formula were
only distributed to Algeria and France. However, as a precautionary
measure, the FSAI is asking all hospitals and pharmacies not to use the
product and to remove it from use.
The global recall was initiated by the manufacturers after batches of the
product were associated with 2 infant deaths in France. The deaths were due
to _Enterobacter sakazakii_, a pathogen that can cause serious infection in
vulnerable infants, but poses little risk to healthy, full-term infants.
To ensure that all product has been fully recalled, the FSAI is enlisting
assistance from environmental health officers, the National Disease
Surveillance Centre and the Irish Medicines Board to alert chemist shops,
pharmaceutical wholesalers and the medical profession.
Dr. John O'Brien, Chief Executive, FSAI stated that this recall is a
precautionary measure and that parents of premature babies should not be
unduly alarmed. Those who have concerns should contact their medical
practitioner for advice.
"This product is very specialized and is adapted for premature babies with
intolerance to cow's milk protein. As such, it was only available in
hospitals and a limited number of pharmacies; it was not available in shops
or supermarkets. The company has assured us that the implicated batches
were never distributed on the Irish market. However, for maximum safety,
all batches of the Pregestimil are being recalled worldwide. I would advise
any parent who may have a can of Pregestimil in their home not use it and
to return it to its point of supply, be it the hospital or their pharmacy."

[_Enterobacter sakazakii_, until 1980, had been referred to as a "yellow
pigmented" _E. cloacae_. The bacterium has been associated with a number of
outbreaks of infection, usually meningitis, in premature neonates (1), with
high rates of morbidity and mortality, although infection can occur in
infants, children and adults (2).
The association of neonatal infection with the use of powdered infant
formula is not new (i.e., reference 3 from 1983). The organism has been
associated with a number of different kinds of powdered formulas from many
different countries, including the USA (4). Microbiological typing has
shown that patient and formula isolates shared the same typing pattern (5).
The organism appears to be more resistant to osmotic and dry stress than
other _Enterbacteriaceae_ (6) and may be more thermotolerant as well. It
was reported in 2004 to be isolated in powdered formula production
environments, other food factories (pasta, potato flour, cereal) as well as
in households (7). Since these products are not truly sterile, guidelines
(8) have been set forth to minimize the risk.
