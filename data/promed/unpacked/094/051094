Almost 10 000 sheep have died from the blue tongue disease, a tragedy that has caused damage of more than 2 million euros [USD 2.7 million]. The warning comes from Coldiretti [Italian Farmers Confederation] calling for an immediate intervention by the region. The areas most affected are the Ogliastra and Sulcis, where the departments have promised immediate action already 2 months ago. "The region of Sardinia had assured all breeders of compensations for the deaths of animals and for loss of income," says the president of the Association, Battista Cualbu.

"Given the situation that has arisen this year [2013]," says the director of Coldiretti, Luca Saba, "we believe that in 2013 there could be a resurgence of the disease, which, if not prevented in a timely manner, will lead to serious damage. We ask the region to become active about the crisis; there are 2 problems to deal with: bluetongue, which kills animals; as well as Schmallenberg virus, which is widespread in the Sardinian countryside causing abortions."

[The extremely high susceptibility of the indigenous Sarda dairy sheep breed to the bluetongue virus is a long-known phenomenon. Sheep breeding is a main source of income in Sardinia (sheep population estimated to exceed 3 million, most if not all of them of the Sarda breed). Vaccinating such sheep with the relevant vaccine strains (currently, most likely BTV-1) is the only practical way to diminish losses. The unfortunate simultaneous circulation of SBV adds to the serious losses; it may be indicative of a common vector.

According to the 6-month report to the OIE, for the months July-December 2011, 3 new BT outbreaks were recorded in Sardinia caused by serotypes 1 and 2. The same serotypes were reportedly identified in Sardinia during January-June 2012 (one new outbreak).

No immediate notifications on BT have been submitted by Italy since 2010. - Mod.AS
