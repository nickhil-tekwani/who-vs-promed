Indonesia: dengue hemorrhagic fever data as of mid-July 2003
------------------------------------------------------------
[This report has been edited to bring it into line with standard
ProMED-mail format. - Mod.CP]
During 2003 up to the middle of July there have been 18 797 dengue
fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) cases reported from 30 provinces
and 188 districts in Indonesia, with 256 fatal cases (case fatality rate
(CFR) = 1.4 per cent). With a total population of 210 million the incidence
is 8.80 [per 10 000] DHF cases reported from hospitals. Indonesian
hospitals have relied on clinical diagnostics, employing standard World
Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Differential diagnosis between DF and
DHF was based on plasma leakage with the indicator haematocrit (20 per cent
increasing or down) and a thrombocyte count below 100 000/mm3. Only a few
of those cases were tested using serological IgM, IgG and hemagglutination
inhibition tests.
DF/DHF cases have been reported for almost 35 years in Indonesia. The
endemic provinces are Jakarta (the capitol ciy), South Sumatera, East Java,
West and East Kalimanatan, South and North Sulawesi with incidences ranging
from 20 to 70 [per 10 000].
Indonesia has a national DHF control program which includes surveillance
and epidemiology, vector control (mosquito and larvae), health education,
case management, inter-sectoral partnership and community participation,
training, and research.

Indonesia: dengue fever outbreak in Medan, North Sumatra
--------------------------------------------------------
MEDAN: At least 145 cases of dengue fever and 3 deaths have been reported
in the North Sumatra capital Medan, health officials said on Wed 6 Aug
2003. Medan health office head Herman Sadeck said the outbreak was an
annual occurrence during the months of July and August, and had always
claimed lives. The varied climate -- sometimes wet and sometimes dry -- had
contributed to the spread of the mosquitoborne disease, he said. The office
recorded 212 cases of dengue fever and 3 deaths last year and 344 cases and
2 deaths in 2001.

Philipinnes: dengue ravages La Union & Cordillera
-------------------------------------------------
SAN FERNANDO CITY: La Union health authorities have raised the alarm about
the rapid increase in the number of dengue cases in the province, where 5
people have already died. The office of the Department of Health in the
Cordillera Administrative Region (DOH-CAR) also reported an alarming
increase in the CAR, from 62 dengue cases in 2002 to 353 this year with one
death. This is a fivefold increase in [dengue] cases, Elnoria Bugnoses of
the Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit told The Times.
This developed as Dr Jose Ostrea, chief of the La Union provincial health
office, reported that a total of 142 dengue patients had sought treatment
in various government and private hospitals since January. Most of the
patients were admitted to the hospitals at the start of the rainy season,
Ostrea said. The 5 reported dead from dengue were residents of this capital
city as well as the towns of Agoo, Bagulin, Aringay, and Naguilian. Of the
total of 142 cases, the capital city of San Fernando, was on top with 36,
followed by Aringay with 23, Bauang 13, San Juan 11, and Bacnotan 10. The
remaining 16 towns in the province have reported at least one dengue case
each, Ostrea said. Reports are that Bacnotan has more than the reported 10
dengue cases.
Meanwhile, a separate report by Emily Laroya, a nurse at the San Fernando
health office, confirmed that this city has the highest number of dengue
cases at 36 as of Wednesday. Laroya said the number includes the 5
additional patients from Barangays Bato and Saoay, who sought treatment in
the hospitals here. She added that city officials have ordered the
intensification of fogging operations, particularly in barangays hardest
hit by the disease.
In the Cordillera, Bugnosen said Ifugao has the highest number of cases
with 132, followed by Baguio with 94, Benguet 65, Mt Province 42, and
Kalinga 3.
There were no reported cases in the two other CAR provinces, Abra and
Apayao, Bugnosen said. The sharp increase in cases reflects the dengue
outbreak in Virac, Ifugao, and Itogon, Benguet.

Europe: surveillance by TropNetEurop of imported dengue infections
------------------------------------------------------------------
[The 4 serotypes of] dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) are
the most common cause of arboviral disease in the world and are mainly
transmitted by bites of the mosquito vector _Aedes aegypti_. In recent
decades, the incidence of the severe form of dengue virus infection, dengue
haemorrhagic fever, has risen dramatically, mainly in South East Asia and
the Americas. According to the World Health Organization, the viruses cause
an estimated 50-100 million illnesses worldwide each year, including 250
000 to 500 000 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and 24 000 deaths (1).
Classical dengue fever is characterised by fever, headache, retro-orbital
pain, myalgia/arthralgia, skin rash, and leucopenia, usually with no deaths
occurring. In contrast, DHF is clinically characterised by haemorrhagic
diathesis and vascular leakage (manifesting as a rise in haematocrit),
ultimately resulting in hypovolaemic shock. The pathogenesis of DHF is not
fully understood, but it has been well documented that secondary dengue
infection is a major risk factor of the disease (2,3). As a consequence,
and maybe also as a result of genetic factors, travellers rarely develop
DHF (4). A high percentage of dengue infections in travellers may be
asymptomatic (5,6).
It has, however, been recognised that travellers have an important role in
introducing more virulent dengue strains into endemic areas where usually
only mild disease occurs (7), or into non-endemic areas where the mosquito
vector is common (8). The recent introduction of _Aedes albopictus_ to
Europe, notably Italy, France, and Albania, may serve as a warning of
things to come (9).
The European Network on Imported Infectious Disease Surveillance
(TropNetEurop, <http://www.tropnet.net/>) was founded in 1999 to detect
emerging infections of potential regional, national, or global impact at
their point of entry into the European population. The network currently
consists of 46 collaborating centres in 15 European countries. Annually,
the collaborating centres give about 220 000 consultations before travel,
and treat 63 000 patients after travel (10,11). Within this network, the
numbers of reported dengue cases increased from 64 in 1999 to 218 in 2002.
The increase has been attributed primarily to the increased number of
reporting sites of the network rather than to an increased incidence of
dengue infections in travellers. The median age in our population was 32
years (range 1-69 years). Males were slightly more frequently affected
(male to female ratio 1.2:1). The median duration of travel during which
patients acquired the dengue infection decreased from 38 days in 1999 to 23
days in 2002.
Forty-five per cent of dengue cases were acquired by patients who had
travelled in countries in South East Asia, 19 per cent were imported from
South and Central America, 16 per cent from the Indian subcontinent, 12 per
cent from the Caribbean, and 8 per cent from Africa. This distribution
mainly reflects worldwide dengue activity, as well as the popularity of
these countries as tourist destinations. Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia
are not only highly endemic areas for dengue viruses; they are also
countries with an expanding tourism sector. Thailand alone was the place of
acquisition for 134 cases (28 per cent) of all travel associated dengue
infections in our network over the past 4 years. In 2002 there was a
proportional rise in the number of infections acquired in South East Asia
compared with 2001. Reporting increased most notably from Thailand,
Indonesia, and Brazil, while India and the Philippines saw a decline in
numbers. There was a clear seasonal pattern in the reporting of dengue with
peaks during the travel seasons in summer and winter.
Most patients were European-born travellers (94 per cent), but we noted
that immigrants born outside Europe and foreign visitors had a 4.3 times
higher risk of developing DHF than those born in Europe. The reporting
system does not include information on the countries of residence of
non-European travellers, but many are likely to be from dengue-endemic
countries. Overall, 13 cases of DHF have been reported (2.7 per cent of all
dengue infections). The travel history of these patients showed that
infections were acquired in all the world's endemic regions: 7 in South
East Asia, 2 in Central America, 2 in South America, one on the Indian
subcontinent, and one in Central Africa. The median travel duration in
patients with DHF was 29 days and was not significantly longer compared
with patients who developed classical dengue fever (26 days, p-value 0.38).
No deaths occurred among the reported dengue patients (DF and DHF).
Three fatal cases of dengue in Europe have been reported to the network
from sources outside the immediate membership. The first case occurred in
1997 in the United Kingdom (UK) and no report was published. The other 2
patients died of DHF in 2002; one was a Bangladeshi immigrant living in the
UK who returned from visiting Bangladesh (12), the other was a young
Finnish journalist travelling in South East Asia (publication in progress).
Overall, in our network we saw an increase in the total number of reported
dengue cases, an increase in cases with more severe disease (DHF), and an
increase in cases with unusual clinical findings (several cases presented
with liver involvement and 2 cases with affected optic nerves(13)). As long
as no effective vaccine is available, dengue viruses will present an
increasingly serious threat to European travellers and an even greater
threat to those living in the countries to which they travel.

India (Karnataka): 79 dengue cases found in Dakshina Kannada
------------------------------------------------------------
Puttur and Bantwal taluks have reported 2 positive cases each, and
Mangalore, Belthangady taluks have reported one case each.
Dr Raj said that 373 blood samples of suspected fever cases were tested and
of them 79 tested positive for dengue. He also confirmed that a 13 year old
girl from Dolpady in Puttur taluk had died of the disease at a private
hospital recently.
Dr Raj said that the fever had spread from neighbouring Kerala, bordering
Sullia taluk, where over 100 deaths had been reported due to dengue. Dr Raj
said that he had requested the district administration and city corporation
to take the matter seriously as the combination of dengue and malaria could
prove dangerous if preventive action was not taken early.
Dengue virus is transmitted through the infected female _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito. The virus enters these mosquitoes when they suck the blood of an
infected person. _Aedes aegypti_ breeds primarily in man-made containers
like earthenware jars, metal drums and concrete cisterns used for domestic
water storage, as well as discarded plastic food containers, used
automobile tyres, coconut shells and other items that collect rain water.
During outbreaks, emergency control measures may also include the
application of insecticides as space sprays to kill adult mosquitoes using
portable machines.

Caribbean Region: decrease in prevalence of Dengue/DHF
------------------------------------------------------
During epidemiological weeks 14 to 26, 2003, 391 cases of dengue fever and
10 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) were reported to CAREC,
compared to 1498 cases of dengue fever and 34 cases of DHF in the
corresponding period last year. This fourfold decrease is likely to be due
to the delayed onset of the rainy season in 2003. During the period under
review 97 per cent of the dengue fever cases were reported from 4
countries, Barbados, Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago.
During the period under review dengue virus type 2 was reported from
Suriname. During the first 13 weeks of 2003, dengue virus type 3 was also
reported from 3 countries, Anguilla, Barbados, and St. Vincent and the
Grenadines.
Since the rainy season has recently commenced CAREC recommends that all
countries should establish or re-establish a dengue fever/DHF outbreak
contingency plan, which should include: preparedness regarding clinical
case management; immediate adulticidal treatments in the vicinity of the
residence of confirmed patients, and the place of work etc, as well as in
other locations where persons are experiencing dengue-like symptoms;
efforts should be made in source reduction activities by householders and
communities, spearheaded by public health authorities. Communities and
inter-sectoral groups should help with organized clean-ups to reduce
sources of mosquito breeding; households with people experiencing febrile
illness should utilize repellents and intra-domiciliary (space) sprays for
personal protection against mosquito bites. Individuals and families could
benefit from such activity; health promotion and education should be used
strategically to encourage communities in this fight against the vector;
inter-sectoral collaboration between the Ministry of Health and Public
Utilities to ensure the availability of water and acceptable levels of
environmental sanitation.
Given that West Nile Virus is present in many eastern states of the USA, it
is likely to be introduced into many Caribbean countries in the near
future. A dengue fever/DHF outbreak contingency plan would also assist in
the prevention and control of West Nile infection. [This report also
includes a table giving cumulative data for dengue/DHF cases by country up
to the end of June 2003; a significant aspect being a high frequency of DHF
in Trinidad and Tobago.]
