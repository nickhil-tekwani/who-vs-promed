Idaho Panhandle health officials confirmed this morning 5 kitchen
workers at Camp Lutherhaven have been sickened by _Escherichia coli_.
3 more staff are ill, but lab tests haven't linked it to the bacterial
infection.

No one has been hospitalized and the ill workers have been excluded
from the kitchen. None of the 300-plus campers has reported getting
sick during the 1st 2 weeks of summer camp along the shores of Lake
Coeur d'Alene.

A review of the camp by health and safety investigators determined
that the camp's food handling procedures were more than adequate. They
suspect that the employees may have contracted the infection in their
living quarters.

The strain at Camp Lutherhaven is _E. coli_ 026. It is different from
the deadly strain that spread across Europe last month [June 2011]
sickening several thousand people and killing at least 47.

Serotype O26 is one of the non-O157 serotype members of the
enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ group. The current O104 disaster in
Europe, primarily Germany, aside, these organisms tend to cause less
severe disease but can be associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome
(HUS). The presence of the infection in camp kitchen workers but not
in the campers is curious.

As a review, such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and
cattle and, although they cause as many as 30 per cent of outbreaks of
VTEC (1), appear to be somewhat less (or at least more variably)
virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4).

In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups,
it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have
unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5). The
serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and
O103 (6), with serotype O26 being the implicated strain in this
outbreak.

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify
VTEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157
strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the
University of Washington, USA (7), 1851 stool samples were processed
for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme
immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4
strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.

Clinically, the O157 infections had a higher frequency of bloody
stools, fecal leukocytes, and abdominal pain with shorter symptom
duration. 5 (18 per cent) of O157 infections developed HUS; none of
the non-O157 strains did. Since toxin assay did not identify all O157
strains found on sMAC plates, the investigators did not advocate
performing toxin assay alone. Non-O157 can produce HUS, as
demonstrated by a cluster of O121 cases associated with a lake in
Connecticut, USA (8).

Since toxin assays are not uniformly performed in many areas, and
most cases do not produce HUS, it is likely that cases due to non-O157
strains are being missed. How frequent this phenomenon will become
over time is unclear.

Because of the higher risk of morbidity and mortality in VTEC
infections treated with antimicrobials (9), antimicrobials should not
be used for known acute cases.
