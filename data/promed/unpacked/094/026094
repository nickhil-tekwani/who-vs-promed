SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY: HUMAN CASES LINKED TO BSE? (2)
=========================================================
This information was being broadcast by the BBC on shortwave radio this
morning (21 March 1996) [from my written notes of radio broadcast:].
Scientists have linked mad cow disease (BSE) and CJD, a fatal brain
illness in humans. It has been thought that the most likely route of
transmission involved eating certain organs of infected cows such as the
brain and spinal cord. Sale of these organs has been banned since 1989. The
disease can take several years to develop.
The latest findings are of concern to the U.K. department of agriculture.
Beef consumption in the U.K. is down and some schools have banned beef.
The latest news has also spawned an international response. Officials from
several EU countries will meet today and senior officials from all EU
countries will meet Monday to reevaluate sales and imports of British beef.
A few German states have already baaned import of the beef, although this
move currently violates EU trade regulations. France has announced today
that it is suspending imports of British beef until further notice. France
says that urgent talks are needed. British officials are now emphasizing
that this link is not proof and says that current restrictions on Britsh
beef are sufficient and do not need to be increased.

As I heard this story three times in a couple hours, I am fairly confident I
scribbled down the information being transmitted accurately.
