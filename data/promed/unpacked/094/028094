As of 12 Oct 2021, the weekly HIV and syphilis outbreak case counts have been updated. Minnesota is currently experiencing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) outbreaks in Hennepin and Ramsey counties as well as the Duluth area. Case counts specific to each outbreak can be found below. Minnesota HIV Case Counts by County shows the incidence of new HIV cases compared to previous years. Partners can use or adapt these resources and tools for HIV outbreak prevention and response in Minnesota.

Hennepin and Ramsey counties are investigating an outbreak of HIV that began in December 2018. The outbreak is occurring among people who inject drugs whose residence at diagnosis was (or was unstably housed or incarcerated) in Hennepin or Ramsey County.

Regardless of transmission risk, [?] has spent time* (*socialized, stayed, was known to buy, sell or use drugs, or has engaged in sexual activity) in a known encampment corridor in Minneapolis or St. Paul since December 2018. As of 12 Oct 2021, Hennepin County holds a count of 64 cases, and Ramsey County currently holds a count of 17 cases.

The outbreak near Duluth was declared among newly diagnosed cases of HIV in people after 1 Sep 2019 residing in the Duluth area at the time of diagnosis or reported cases of HIV that are linked to cases that are part of the outbreak as a sex partner, drug user sharing partner, person in their social network or molecular linkage.

[Hennepin and Ramsey are adjacent counties in central Minnesota, included in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington Metropolitan Statistical Area (population almost 3.7 million residents; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul). The cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul (the Minnesota state capitol) are located in this Metropolitan Statistical Area (https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/econ/ec2012/csa/EC2012_330M200US378M.pdf). Duluth, with a population of about 86 000 residents, is a port city on Lake Superior in St. Louis County, Minnesota, 150 miles (241 km) to the north of Minneapolis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth,_Minnesota).

Outbreaks of HIV infection were declared by the Minnesota Department of Health in Hennepin and Ramsey counties in 2020, with cases dating back to 2018, and in the Duluth area in 2021, with cases dating back to 2019. The HIV outbreaks are occurring in people who use injection drugs or share needles/works; people experiencing homelessness or unstable housing; men who have sex with men (MSM); and people who exchange sex for income and other items they need (https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/hiv/stats/hiv.html#background1). Molecular data generated from genetic sequencing of HIV have helped identify the transmission clusters. The demographics of the people involved in these outbreaks are not otherwise specified.

The total number of new cases of HIV infection in each of Minnesota's counties in 2019, 2020 and 2021, as of 31 Aug 2021, can be found at https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/hiv/stats/hiv.html#cases1. Hennepin County, for example, had 134, 101, and 102 new cases of HIV infection in 2019, 2020, and 2012, respectively, as of 31 Aug 2021.

Although unclear in the news report above, as of 12 Oct 2021, the number of new cases of HIV apparently restricted to those who have some connection with a "known encampment corridor in Minneapolis or St. Paul," is 64 for Hennepin County and 17 for Ramsey County. News reports in the past several years that address homeless people living in "encampments" in Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Duluth can be found in The New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/23/us/native-americans-homeless-minneapolis-reservations.html) and local news outlets (https://minnesotareformer.com/2021/09/08/indigenous-leaders-alarmed-at-drugs-lawlessness-at-franklin-street-encampment/ and https://www.wdio.com/duluth-minnesota-news/homeless-encampment-point-of-rocks-eviction-hra-chum-/5896346/). - Mod.ML
