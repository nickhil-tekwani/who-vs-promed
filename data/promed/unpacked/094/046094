The Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs said [Wed 18 Oct 2017] that 2 residents at the Illinois Veterans Home in Quincy contracted Legionnaires' disease.

Department spokesman Dave MacDonna said one resident died last week [week of Sun 8 Oct 2017], although officials believe the death resulted from a "long, complex medical history" and was not the direct result of Legionnaires' disease. MacDonna said the other resident is recovering.
MacDonna said staff at the home is using monitoring symptoms to stay on top of the situation, and any resident showing respiratory issues is being watched closely. He said the staff is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Adams County Health Department.

"We are testing the water and closely monitoring residents," MacDonna said. "We don't know the source (of the Legionnaires' [disease]) at this point." The head of the home says he's surprised to see 2 recent cases of Legionnaires' disease surface among residents because the home's frequent water tests have shown no signs of _Legionella_.

"The clinical indications (from the 2 cases) are not matching with our water quality results," Administrator Troy Culbertson said [Wed 18 Oct 2017] afternoon. "We have had very good water quality results for this whole year [2017]. In fact, none of our sites on campus are testing positive." Culbertson said the Veterans Home's water is tested 500 times a week across the campus, and "all of our results have been negative."

The state Department of Veterans' Affairs began a nearly USD 5 million extensive rehabilitation of the Veterans Home in summer 2015 after Legionnaires' disease sickened 53 people there and led to 12 deaths. Three other residents were sickened during another outbreak last year [2016] after the new water treatment plant and delivery system was unveiled in June 2016.

A chemical mixing system was installed at the Veterans Home to treat the water beyond what occurs at the Quincy water treatment plant, and a 2nd level of purification occurs when the treated water is heated to 160 degrees to kill bacteria. Water is then cooled before it comes out of the tap. The water is also tested each day. Culbertson said the home's new plant "is doing its job, and we're very excited about the results we've seen."

Culbertson wonders if perhaps the 2 residents may have contracted the disease while off campus. "That is a very real possibility that the (Department of Public Health) and (Illinois) EPA are looking at right now," he said. Culbertson said residents "go outside the campus all the time" and frequently take public transportation to businesses in Quincy.

He said the Veterans Home has been doing everything possible to guard against any more outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease. In addition to all of the water testing, he said the home's nursing staff has gone above and beyond what the Centers for Disease Control recommend in reviewing patients for any possible respiratory illnesses. Nurses take readings of vital signs from residents every 4 hours to look for elevated temperatures or other symptoms of potential illness. Anyone showing early signs of an illness is treated quickly, usually with good results, he said. "They don't even get sick enough to go to the hospital," he said. And with the flu and pneumonia seasons on the horizon, "we're very proactive with our flu vaccinations and pneumonia vaccinations," he added.

Culbertson said the home will keep testing its water daily and will continue to "critically analyze" the water treatment plant on a regular basis to see whether anything more can be done to prevent any disease from infiltrating the system. "We're taking it very seriously," he said.

Culbertson said the one death that occurred might not have been directly associated with Legionnaires' disease because "this gentleman had several medical comorbidities that led to his demise." The other reported case involved a man who "was not even sent to the hospital," Culbertson said. "In fact, he was only recently treated for [legionellosis]. He was being treated for pneumonia. He has fully recuperated."

MacDonna of the Department of Veterans' Affairs said there is no need for the community members to be alarmed if they are visiting the campus, and the department wanted to alert the community to the 2 recent cases because of the cases in previous years.
_Legionella_ is found in rivers, wells, ponds and other sources. The bacteria grow in warm water and can be inhaled through contaminated water vapor.

[In 2015, ProMED-mail reported on 53 cases of legionnaires' disease, including 12 deaths, at the Quincy veterans home, plus another 4 patients with legionnaires' disease in Quincy who were said to be not connected to the veterans home (Legionellosis - USA (15): (IL) fatal, veterans home, update, RFI 20150924.3668124). The outbreak recurred in 2016, when 2 cases were reported in Jul 2016, less than a month after a nearly USD 5 million state-of-the-art water treatment plant and delivery system was unveiled at the facility (Legionellosis - USA (04): (IL) vet home, updated water treatment, new cases, RFI 20160728.4377020). Now we have 2 more cases in the past month [October 2017] in residents of the Quincy Illinois Veterans Home. We await results of the ongoing investigation.

Quincy, with a population of 40 633 in 2010, is a city on the Mississippi River and the county seat of Adams County, Illinois, United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy,_Illinois). Many veterans homes are managed and funded by state governments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_soldiers%27_home). The Illinois Veterans Home in Quincy is responsible for providing economical and quality long-term care for veterans and their spouses, which includes domiciliary care, intermediate care, and skilled healthcare (http://www.quincyivh.org). According to its website, the Illinois Veterans Home in Quincy is one of the larger and older veterans homes in the country, with nearly 450 residents and over 25 buildings that house a post office, bank, assembly hall, guest house, mini post exchange, chapel, animal park, museum, and television station; water, sewer, gas, electricity, telephone, and data networks are owned and maintained by the Veterans Home (http://www.quincyivh.org).
