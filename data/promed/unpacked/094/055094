Two Egyptian boys contract bird flu
-----------------------------------
Two Egyptian boys have contracted the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu
virus, bringing the total number of cases in the most populous Arab
country to 74, state news agency MENA said on Wednesday [20 May 2009].

Egypt, hit harder by bird flu than any other country outside Asia,
has seen a surge in cases in recent weeks with 14 new human
infections and 4 deaths reported since 1 April 2009 -- more than the
country saw in all of 2008.

The children -- a 4-year-old boy from [Dakahlia] in the Nile Delta
and a 3-year-old boy from Sohag in the south -- were admitted to
hospital with high fever and were in a stable condition after being
treated with Tamiflu, MENA reported. It quoted a health ministry
spokesman as saying that both boys had been in contact with birds
suspected of being infected with the disease.

The new infections came just days after a 4-year-old girl died of the
virus on Monday [18 May 2009]. Overall, 27 Egyptians have died after
contracting the virus. Most Egyptians who contracted the disease fell
ill after coming into contact with infected domestic birds in a
country where roughly 5 million households depend on domestically
raised poultry as a significant source of food and income.
