[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 785 686 with 81 518 (10.4%) cases reported by China. There are now a total of 704 168 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 204 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 63 550 cases when compared with the data on 29 Mar 2020, with the USA accounting for 22 178 (34.9%), Italy for 4050 (6.4%), Spain for 7846 (12.3%), and Germany for 4450 (7.0%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 89.6% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 20.9% of the global cases of COVID-19. The USA and Italy have overtaken China in total numbers of cases. A global total of 37 811 deaths have been reported, 34 506 (91.3%) outside mainland China.

It is now clear that while China has the largest population in the world, and was the original location where the COVID-19 outbreak started, it has markedly reduced transmission to a manageable level, now monitoring all arrivals in the country from outside. South Korea has slowly decreased daily, new case counts hovering around 100 in recent days. The USA is now number one outside China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and Italy is number 2. Iran has slowed down in growth rate and Spain has been accelerating. To get an understanding of how rapidly things increase, look at Turkey. The 1st confirmed case was reported on 11 Mar 2020 and in 19 days the country has confirmed 10 827 cases and it now ranks number 12 out of 204 countries/territories in terms of absolute numbers of confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Subscriber question re: Vaping and SARS-CoV-2 transmission, request for information
Date: Mon 30 Mar 2020
From: David R Oppenheimer <Davido@oppinfo.com> [edited]


Is it possible that vaping as a low temperature atomizer could cause an infected person to spread a virus by linking to the outgassed [or exhaled. - Mod.SH] vapor and therefore creating a lingering cloud?

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET

Highlights
----------
- No new countries/territories/areas reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- WHO has updated the operational planning guidelines to help countries maintain essential health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The document includes a set of immediate actions that countries should consider at national, regional, and local levels to reorganize and maintain access to high quality essential health services for all. More information is available at https://www.who.int/publications-detail/covid-19-operational-guidance-for-maintaining-essential-health-services-during-an-outbreak.

These data come from Table 1: Countries, territories or areas with reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Data as of [10:00 AM 30 Mar 2020], available at the source URL above. I am presenting the regional case totals without the addition of China for consistency in following trends in the regions. - Mod.MPP]

WHO region (no. countries/territories): Total confirmed cases (new) / Total deaths (new) / Transmission classification [no. countries] local / no. countries imported / no. countries under investigation

Western Pacific Region (18): 21 298 (881) / 339 (19) / Local (15) / Imported (2) [does not include China] / Under investigation (1)
European Region (60): 392 757 (31 728) / 23 962 (2535) / Local (56) / Imported (0) / Under investigation (4)

Other:
Cases on an international conveyance (Diamond Princess): 712 (0) / 7 (0) / Local / 0

Confirmed cases (new conf cases) / Total deaths (new deaths)
Sub-total: 610 770 (58 305) / 29 789 (3455) (excluding China and Diamond Princess)
Grand total (including China and Diamond Princess): 693 224 (58 411) / 33 106 (3215)

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China now totals 201. This includes 18 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 21 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 51 countries (including 16 territories) from the Americas region, and 41 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 21 289 new cases ( in the past 24 hours of which 90.8% were reported by the USA, followed by Canada (4.2%) and Brazil (2.3%). The European region continues with rapid transmission, having confirmed 31 726 (54.4%) new cases and 2535 (78.9%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, with Italy accounting for 16.4 % of newly confirmed cases, Spain for 20.6% of newly confirmed cases, Germany for 15.0% of newly confirmed cases, and France for 7.9% of newly confirmed cases (bringing the total of these 4 countries accounting for 59.9% of newly confirmed cases in Europe, down from 62.0% yesterday (29 Mar 2020). In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 2901 new cases representing 81.7% of the regional newly reported cases. Pakistan. Saudi Arabia and the UAE (United Arab Emirates) represent 2.8%, 2.7%, and 2.9% respectively. In the African region, South Africa reported 19.3% of the newly reported cases in the past 24 hours and Burkina Faso reported 15.8% of the newly reported cases in the region. In the Western Pacific region, Australia did not report any cases, the Philippines reported 38.9% of the total (excluding China), followed by Japan with 19.6%, and Malaysia with 17.0%. In South East Asia, Thailand reported 36.3% of newly confirmed cases followed by Indonesia with 34.7% and India with 24.5%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [30 Mar 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve shows a lowering in the past 24 hours probably related to inconsistent reporting over the weekend.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
