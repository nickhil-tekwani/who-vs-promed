At 04:00 on [29 Mar 2020], 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps reported 31 new confirmed cases, 30 of which were cases imported from abroad, 1 was a local case (1 in Gansu); 4 new deaths (4 in Hubei); and 17 new suspected cases, all of which were imported.

On the same day, 322 cases newly recovered and were discharged, there were 1575 close contacts under medical observation, and 109 cases were removed from the severe category.

There are 630 confirmed cases (including 19 severe cases) imported [from] overseas, and 165 suspected cases. A total of 723 cases were confirmed, 93 cases were cured and discharged, and 0 cases died.

As of 24:00 on [29 Mar 2020], according to reports from 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, there were 2396 confirmed cases (including 633 severe cases) and 168 suspected cases. There have been a total of 81 470 confirmed cases, 75 700 recovered and discharged cases, and 3304 deaths, followed by 704 190 close contacts and 19 235 close contacts who are still under medical observation.

In Hubei there were 0 new confirmed cases (0 in Wuhan), 317 newly recovered cases (315 in Wuhan), 4 new deaths (4 in Wuhan), and 1733 confirmed cases (1726 in Wuhan).

[This is the 6th consecutive day with no newly confirmed cases reported from Wuhan or Hubei province in its entirety in the past 24 hours. There are no newly suspected cases in Wuhan or Hubei. There are 31 new cases reported to have been confirmed in the past 24 hours. All but 1 of the reported newly confirmed cases are imported. A key question with respect to the sporadic non-import related cases, are they a sign of "silent community transmission" or can a chain of infection be identified back to an imported case?

According to the report above, a total of 81 470 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, representing an increase of 31 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (28 Mar 2020) report was prepared. In addition, 4 deaths were reported, all in Hubei province (all 4 in Wuhan). 59 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, which continues to increase the number of newly confirmed cases on a daily basis. And Macau reported 1 additional newly confirmed case in the past 24 hours, bringing its total to 38.

A total of 30 were imported cases into China. Locations of importation were not available but the total number of imported cases is now 723. There are an additional 165 suspected imported cases. Clearly the challenge for China now is identification of infections in imported cases, tracing their contacts and preventing the recurrence of community wide transmission.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and will end it in Wuhan on 6 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing...

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 78 cases and 6 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (28-29 Mar 2020) when there were 105 newly confirmed cases. A total of 9661 cases including 158 deaths were reported today, up from 9538 cases and 152 deaths yesterday [28 Mar 2020]. The daily newly confirmed case count had been at or below 100 newly confirmed cases per day for 8 consecutive days. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 68.6% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 13.4% of the total cases reported. In the past 24 hours, Daegu reported 18% of the total newly confirmed cases while Seoul represented 20.5% of the newly confirmed case reports and in Gyeonggi 19.2%. Quarantined imported cases represented 16.7% of the newly confirmed cases.

Similar to what is being seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases returning to South Korea. There are now 202 imported cases in quarantine with the 1st report of patients in quarantine on 16 Mar 2020, when 4 cases were reported (COVID-19 update (41): global, surge capacity, vaccine development, WHO 20200316.7096222). As in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. There are obvious concerns regarding initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 19 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 18 days since the countrywide lockdown.

[4] Iran: 38 309 total cases, 2640 deaths
Date: Sun 29 Mar 2020 11:46 AM GST

Iran's coronavirus death toll has risen to 2640, a health ministry official said on Sunday [29 Mar 2020], as the Middle East's worst-hit country grapples with the fast-spreading outbreak. "In the past 24 hours we had 123 deaths and 2901 people have been infected, bringing the total number of infected people to 38 309," Alireza Vahabzadeh, an adviser to the health minister, said in a tweet. "12 391 people infected from the virus have recovered." Health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur told state TV that 3467 of those infected were in "critical condition".

"I am happy to announce that also 12 391 people who had been infected across the country have recovered," Jahanpur said. "The average age of those who have died of the disease is 69."

President Hassan Rouhani urged Iranians to adapt to their new way of life, which was likely to continue for some time. "We must prepare to live with the virus until a treatment is discovered ... The new measures that have been imposed are for everyone's benefit ... Our main priority is the safety and the health of our people," Rouhani said during a televised meeting.

The government has banned inter-city travel after warning of a potential surge in coronavirus cases because many Iranians defied calls to cancel travel plans for the Persian New Year holidays that began on [20 Mar 2020]. The authorities told Iranians to stay at home, while schools, universities, cultural, religious, and sports centres have been temporarily closed.

To stem the spread of the virus in crowded jails, Iran's judiciary on Sunday [29 Mar 2020] extended furloughs for 100 000 prisoners. On [17 Mar 2020], Iran said it had freed about 85 000 people from jail temporarily, including political prisoners. "The 2nd wave of (the) temporary release of prisoners had already started and their (100 000 prisoners) furloughs have been extended until [19 Apr 2020]," judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili was reported as saying by state television. Iran said it had 189 500 people in prison, according to a report submitted by the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran to the Human Rights Council in January [2020].

The number of deaths has also increased from 2517 to 2640 an increase of 123 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 7th globally behind USA, Italy, China, Spain, Germany and France. In early March 2020, Iran and Italy were on the same trajectory with respect to daily growth in cumulative newly confirmed cases, but starting 8 Mar 2020, Italy's daily reported newly confirmed cases accelerated at an alarming speed. By 14 Mar 2020, Italy was reporting almost twice as many cases as Iran on a daily basis.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 142 321 including 2484 deaths. New York state, with 59 648 (41.9%) cumulative cases reports and 6193 (33.3%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is showing increases. Daily reported case counts are accelerating in New Jersey, Michigan, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, and Illinois.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has 2 epidemic curves. One focuses on date of confirmation of disease, the other on date of onset of illness. The curve of interest, by date of onset of disease, is based on 14.6% of the number of cases plotted on the epidemic curve using date of confirmation of disease.
