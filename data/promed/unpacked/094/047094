Viet Nam: 6 New Avian Influenza Cases Detected
-------------------------------------------------------
Viet Nam has recorded 6 more avian influenza victims, taking the number of
infections in the country to 61 since December [2004], 18 of whom have
died, state media reported on Wed 15 Jun 2005. The 6 are being treated in a
Hanoi hospital, the Tuoi Tre newspaper quoted the National Institute for
Clinical Research of Tropical Medicine as saying.
It said one hospital doctor who had been taking samples from carriers of
the H5N1 virus had now developed a fever himself and was suspected of being
infected. The hospital was also treating 2 women found last month [May
2005] to have been infected with H5N1, the newspaper said.
The H5N1 virus has killed 18 Vietnamese since 16 Dec 2004, when the disease
resurfaced, taking the country's [death] toll to 38 since it appeared in
late 2003. 12 Thais and 4 Cambodians have also died.
Avian influenza 1st emerged in the Mekong Delta in southern Viet Nam in
late 2003 then spread to the northern region, where the virus appears to
develop rapidly during the winter.
Scientists fear that avian influenza, which is infectious in birds but does
not spread easily among humans, could mutate into a form capable of
generating a pandemic in which millions of people without immunity could die.

Viet Nam: 6 H5N1-positive Patients Discovered
-----------------------------------------------
The Clinical Institute for Tropical Diseases in Viet Nam has received 10
suspected avian influenza patients from respiratory disease departments.
6 out of the 10 patients tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza on Tue 14
Jun 2005. In addition, a doctor from the institute is also suspected of
contracting the virus, as he has a high temperature. Currently, 7 out of 8
H5N1 patients are in good condition, and only one patient is in a serious
condition.

[After a lull in the reporting of human cases of avian influenza virus
infection in Viet Nam, a total of 9 new case have been reported since the
middle of May 2005. It is not yet clear whether this reflects improved
surveillance or an up-surge in animal disease and consequent increased risk
of human exposure to infection. The 2nd report states that the condition of
7 of 8 cases of avian influenza (a figure which presumably includes 2
suspected cases) is not serious, which may favor the improved surveillance
interpretation. - Mod.CP]
