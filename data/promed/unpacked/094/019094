Text basically unintelligible.

[This report shows all the signs of being a computer jumbled translation of
a report from somewhere in Indonesia. A search produced two articles
in Bahasa Indonesia which appear to be close to the origin:

<http://www.metrotvnews.com/index.php/metromain/news/2010/03/30/14019/Warga-

Maros-Terkena-Antraks>

The activities of the various government agencies are hard to make out from
this very confused account. Otherwise it would seem to be a continuation of
what we reported in January 2010, which raises the question as to whether
that problem was continuing in spite of the announced vaccination programme,
or this was merely a late report of human cases.

Clarification of what is presently happening in South Sulawesi would be
appreciated.- Mod.MHJ]
