In a major blow to Pakistan's efforts to become a polio-free nation, at least 8 polio cases have surfaced in North Waziristan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) this year [2022] so far. The health ministry has reported the latest infection in a 20-month-old child in the Miranshah area.

Federal Health Minister Ghulam Qadir Patel said polio cases were surfacing in the area already declared sensitive. He said the government had taken solid preventive measures after the 1st 2 cases were reported in North Waziristan this year [2022]. Patel said the government was taking measures on a war footing to eradicate the poliovirus from Pakistan and emphasised that eradication of the disabling and life-threatening disease was a collective responsibility.

The minister urged people to ensure their children are administered polio drops and vowed that the government would use all resources to make Pakistan polio free. Federal Health Secretary Dr Fakhar Alam said an anti-polio drive was carried out simultaneously in Pakistan and Afghanistan from [23-27 May 2022], adding that around 50 million children were administered polio drops during this campaign.

Dr Alam said that movement of people between the neighbouring countries posed a threat of virus spread, adding that they were taking cross-border measures to stop spread of the disease.

He emphasized that efforts were required to save children from lifetime disability.

In the 2nd case from Miranshah, a 20-month-old boy was paralyzed by wild polio, health officials confirmed on Friday [3 May 2022].

The child had onset of paralysis on 15 May [2022] and is suffering from disabilities in all 4 limbs, the Pakistan Polio Laboratory at the National Institute of Health confirmed late on Wednesday [1 Jun 2022?].

"Following the 1st 2 cases in April [2022], the wild polio programme took immediate steps to ring-fence this area and prevent the virus from spreading further, particularly in the historic reservoirs of Karachi, Peshawar, and Quetta.

"Pakistan has made tremendous success against polio over the past few years, and we are taking all steps to protect the gains made by the programme," said Federal Health Minister Abdul Qadir Patel. The Minister added that it was crucial for parents to vaccinate their children every time, as every dose of polio vaccine further builds immunity.

"To prevent the virus from spreading across borders, Pakistan and Afghanistan had synchronized nationwide polio immunization campaigns from 23 to 27 May [2022]," said Federal Health Secretary Dr. Fakhre Alam Irfan.

"The cases are highlighting exactly where the challenges lie, and we are doing our utmost to ensure that the virus remains contained and we fight it till the end," said National Emergency Operations Coordinator, Dr Shahzad Baig.

This is the 8th case in Pakistan this year [2022], with all children belonging to North Waziristan. Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by poliovirus mainly affecting children under the age of 5 years. It invades the nervous system and can cause paralysis or even death. While there is no cure for polio, vaccination is the most effective way to protect children from this crippling disease.

Each time, a child under the age of 5 is vaccinated, their protection against the virus is increased. Repeated immunisations have protected millions of children from polio, allowing almost all countries in the world to become polio-free, besides the 2 endemic countries of Pakistan and Afghanistan.

[While the vaccination history of this case isn't specifically mentioned, North Waziristan is an area with a significant proportion of families that have refused vaccinations for their children. The ages of these cases reported this year are less than 2 years old, consistent with a timeline of 2 years since the preceding WPV1 outbreak in Pakistan... suggesting a large enough pool of susceptibles exist after a 2-year period.
