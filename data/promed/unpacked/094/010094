PUBLIC HEALTH ALERT
-------------------
The New York City Health Department Advises Queens Residents to Take
Precautions Against Mosquitoes
Three area residents in the Whitestone/Flushing/Auburndale sections of
Queens have developed St. Louis Encephalitis (SLE), a serious illness which
is transmitted by a mosquito called _Culex pipiens_. One of these
individuals died earlier this week. In addition to the confirmed cases, DOH
is investigating approximately 24 possible other cases primarily from this
area of Queens. In response to this public health concern, the City of New
York is spraying insecticide to eliminate mosquito breeding places in these
areas. The New York City Department of Health advises residents in the
Whitestone, Auburndale and Flushing sections of Queens to take immediate
precautions to prevent mosquito bites and to eliminate stagnant water
around and near your home.
SLE is transmitted when an infected mosquito bites humans. It is not
transmitted person-to-person, nor is it transmitted to or by pets.
Infections vary widely in severity. Most people who are infected have no
symptoms or may experience a fever and headache before fully recovering. In
some individuals, particularly the elderly or infants, SLE can be a serious
disease that affects the central nervous system. At its most serious, the
disease can cause permanent neurological damage and it can be fatal.
Symptoms generally occur five to 15 days following the bite of an infected
mosquito and range from a slight fever or headache to rapid onset of severe
headache, high fever, muscle aches, stiff neck, disorientation, coma,
tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, paralysis, or death.
To reduce mosquito contact, the Department of Health recommends:
If you are outdoors during evening and night time hours when mosquitoes are
most active, wear protective clothing such as long pants, long-sleeved
shirts and socks.
Use insect repellants with no more than 30% DEET, but use sparingly and
with care. (Products containing 15% or less DEET are recommended for
children but products containing DEET should not be used on infants.
Carefully read and follow directions on the container and wash treated skin
when mosquito exposure has ended).
Avoid unnecessary outdoor activity during evening and night time hours.
Empty water from outside objects such as bird baths and any containers in
which water accumulates and where mosquitoes breed.
Ensure that door and window screens are in good repair.
The New York City Department of Health, in collaboration with the Mayor's
Office of Emergency Management, will be spraying the affected neighborhoods
in Queens with malathion - an insecticide - beginning this evening.
Malathion is one of the least toxic pesticides which is effective for
killing adult mosquitoes.
People and pets should stay indoors if possible.
Some people may be sensitive to any pesticide whether applied by air or by
ground crews. Avoiding exposure will lessen the risk of any reactions.
Reactions might include eye irritation, rash, and respiratory problems.
Close all doors and windows and keep them closed for two to three hours
after spraying is completed.
Turn fans and air conditioners off, or set the exhaust so air exits from
the house.
Remove children's toys from outdoor areas and clothes from outdoor clothes
lines. (If toys are left outside, wash thoroughly with soap and water
before using again).
Malathion breaks down in water and does not build up in the soil. It does
not stay suspended in air.
There is no need for spraying inside your home.
If you have questions about St. Louis Encephalitis, about how to prevent
mosquito bites, or about the insecticide spraying, call:

As emergency management officials dispatched pesticide-spraying helicopters
to northern Queens and the South Bronx, city officials confirmed on
Saturday that a second elderly Queens resident had died of St. Louis
encephalitis and that 31 other people might have contracted the
mosquito-borne viral disease.
"There are now 33 cases that are at some level of suspicion," Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani said. "Some of them may not turn out to be St. Louis
encephalitis."
Neal L. Cohen, the city's Health Commissioner, said medical tests on a
second elderly victim, an 87-year-old woman, had confirmed that she died of
St. Louis encephalitis at Flushing Hospital Medical Center on Thursday. On
Friday, the Mayor said that an 80-year-old man had died of the disease at
Flushing Hospital on Tuesday.
Cohen said three people were known to have contracted the disease -- one
more than on Friday -- and were being treated. In each confirmed case, he
said, the victim was a resident of northern Queens.
Cohen sought to reassure people that their chances of catching the disease
are remote.
"While we are taking extensive precautionary measures to reduce the
mosquito population, the risk of contracting St. Louis encephalitis remains
minimal," he said. Outbreaks elsewhere in the nation have shown that only 1
in 1000 mosquitoes carries the disease, and most people who are infected
recover fully after mild periods of illness, he said.
Still, with the extent of the infections in New York City still unknown,
the Mayor and other officials advised people to avoid contact with
mosquitoes by using mosquito repellent, and to avoid wearing shorts or
short-sleeved garments when they go outdoors.
The officials said other measures should be taken to avoid mosquito
infestations at people's homes, like emptying bird baths and draining areas
of the ground where water collects, since water provides a breeding ground
for mosquitoes.
In the northern Queens neighborhoods of Whitestone, Flushing and
Auburndale, where health officials said the outbreak had been centered,
residential streets were eerily quiet yesterday. People stayed indoors,
resisting the temptation to spend the beginning of a Labor Day weekend over
barbecues, at playgrounds or in other outdoor recreation.
Those who might have missed the city's health warnings on Friday afternoon
would have had a difficult time remaining unaware of the problem by early
Friday evening, when helicopters began spraying the pesticide malathion
over the section of northern Queens close to the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge.
City crews returned to the area yesterday morning, and continued spraying
parks, low-lying marshy areas and some people's lawns.
The spraying was to be expanded around dusk last night -- when mosquitoes
are most active -- to sections of the South Bronx, said Jerome M. Hauer,
director of the City Office of Emergency Management.
Cohen said the spraying would resume this morning in both areas of Queens
and the Bronx, but it had not been determined whether further spraying
would be necessary tonight.
"Everyone in the neighborhood is very concerned, but no one is pushing the
panic button," said Paul Leonardo, a 45-year-old resident of 138th Street
in Whitestone, who stepped outside briefly yesterday after a reporter rang
his bell. Leonardo said his block would normally be a "very social place"
on a Saturday, particularly on a holiday weekend.
"But I told everyone to stay indoors last night and today," Leonardo said,
before he returned to an afternoon of indoor activity with his wife, mother
and two children.
The Leonardo house was close to an emergency command center set up by
Hauer's staff at 138th Street and 11th Avenue. The center was dispatching
city workers yesterday with bags of mosquito repellent and brochures
describing protective measures to neighborhood nursing homes and senior
citizen centers. Health officials said elderly people and young children
are most vulnerable to St. Louis encephalitis.
In its effort to eradicate [*incorrect usage* - R.S.] mosquitoes, the city
said, it had concentrated since Friday night on the sections of northern
Queens lying south of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge and the Throgs Neck
Bridge, particularly on wet, low-lying areas like Powell's Cove, an East
River inlet.
Beginning last night, they said, the pesticide spraying would be expanded
to sections of the South Bronx that border the East River and Bronx River,
including Sound View Park and Ferry Point Park.
At his news conference, Mayor Giuliani advised people in the areas that
were to be sprayed to shut their windows and turn off their
air-conditioners when the spraying took place. Although the pesticide is
not hazardous to people or their pets, its odor can be annoying it gets
indoors.

[We believe that it has been decades since SLE has been identified this far
east in the USA, and perhaps this may be the first reported outbreak in New
York City. Many thanks to the several subscribers who sent us reports of
this outbreak. - Mods.JW/ES]
