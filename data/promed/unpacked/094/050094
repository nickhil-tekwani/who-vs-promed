[According to the report above, new (no. 10) follow-up report on the LSD event in Kazakhstan, the epizootic, which reportedly started on 7 Jul 2016, is "continuing".

Some of the information in the 11 reports, duly submitted by Kazakhstan to the OIE, is in need of elucidation:

1. In the immediate notification, submitted 22 Jul 2016, it was stated that 459 cases of LSD were recorded within a population of 3557 cattle, of which 34 died; none were reported as destroyed. The location was named "Makasch, Kurmangazinskiy, Mangyshlak [Mangystau region]". The "nature of diagnosis" was reportedly "clinical". Among the control measures, "vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists)" was included.

2. In follow-up report no. 1, submitted 25 Jul 2016, it was stated, "There are no new outbreaks in this report". The "nature of diagnosis" was changed to "clinical, laboratory (advanced)" and the following laboratory diagnosis was included:
Laboratory name and type: All-Russian Research Institute for Animal Health (FGBI-ARRIAH) (OIE reference laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 25 Jul 2016 / Positive

3. In follow-up report no. 2, "nature of diagnosis" was similarly indicated as "clinical, laboratory (advanced)" but no further details were included.

4. In follow-up reports 3, 4, and 5, "nature of diagnosis" was "clinical", and -- accordingly -- no "diagnostic test results" (laboratory involvement) included.

5. In follow-up report no. 6, dated 17 Oct 2016, "nature of diagnosis" was similarly indicated as "clinical" but in the section "Diagnostic test results" the following information was presented:

Laboratory name and type: National Reference Veterinary Center (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 15 Oct 2016 / Positive

6. Follow-up reports 7, 8, 9, and 10 indicated that "nature of diagnosis" was "clinical", and no further "diagnostic test results" (laboratory involvement) were presented.

7. Another noteworthy component of Kazakhstan's reporting refers to "Epidemiological comments". Starting in follow-up report no. 8 (31 Oct 2016) and repeated in the subsequent reports (nos. 9 and 10), under 'Epidemiological comments' the following statement was included: "compensation to the animals' owners for dead cattle at the market price is being developed and will be implemented soon."

8. All 10 follow-up reports stated, "There are no new outbreaks in this report". No vaccination data have been included in any of them.

In light of the data above, some questions arise:

1. Which samples have been processed by Kazakhstan's National reference Veterinary Center on 15 Oct 2015? (location/date sampled)?

2. Which animals are to be compensated/has culling been applied? In case affirmative, when, where and how many animals destroyed?

3. Has vaccination been applied? In case affirmative, which vaccine has been applied, where, and how many animals vaccinated?

Posting 20160727.4374008 (of 27 Jul 2016) which cited a detailed media report on LSD in Kazakhstan, included the following comment: "According to the above information and earlier media-derived reports (eg http://www.kyrgyzkorm.kg/news/zagadochnaya-bolezn-porazhaet-skot-v-kazaxstane.html), LSD started its circulation in the Atyrau region, and probably also in West Kazakhstan, during June 2016 -- at least 5 weeks prior to the 1st notification of the disease by the Veterinary Services to the OIE (20160722.4363497). The OIE notification reported LSD diagnosis in the Mangystau region, located southern to the above 2 regions. The 3 [probably] infected regions can be seen in the administrative map available at http://tinyurl.com/j4cyqe7."
