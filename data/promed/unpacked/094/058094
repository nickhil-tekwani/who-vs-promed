Spurt in Pneumonia cases in summer surprises docs
-------------------------------------------------
City paediatricians are surprised by the rise in the last 3 months in
cases of pneumonia, a respiratory illness they usually don't see until
winter. The number of cases being reported at several children's
hospitals in the city now is similar to that seen in the flu season in
November and December. On Sunday [1 May 2011], at the Dr MS
Ramakrishna Memorial Endowment Oration and talk on protocols and
problem-solving in paediatrics, Dr S K Kabra, paediatric
pulmolonologist from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said
the lung infection, which is curable, kills 1.6 million children,
including 140 000 Indian children, every year.

The incidence of the illness has been increasing several fold in the
past few years. Doctors at the Kanchi Kamakoti Childs Trust Hospital,
which organised the lecture, couldn't agree more. Between March 2010
and March 2011, they saw a 2-fold increase in the number of children
with pneumonia at the hospital. In the past year, 296 children were
detected with pneumonia. "We see at least 3 cases every week in the
hospital. That's how much we saw in peak winter last year. In most
cases, the lung infection is community-acquired," said Dr Janani
Sankar, senior consultant, Kanchi Kamakoti Child Trust Hospital.

There are no studies to point out scientific reasons for the sudden
spurt this summer. Doctors say the change in holiday patterns and
summer camps where children are in close contact with one other could
be one reason for the high infection rate. They are most likely to
catch the infection in crowded places where children inhale these
bacteria or virus in the air. Another reason could be the sudden rain
during summer. "Summer showers along with high temperatures make
children more vulnerable to viral and bacterial infections," says Dr
A. Parthasarathy, Professor of Paediatrics, MGR Medical College.

Community-acquired pneumonia is preventable. Immunization against
Hib, pneumococcus, measles and whooping cough is the most effective
way to prevent pneumonia. Even if children get it they can be cured in
3 days with simple antibiotics. Some would rarely require treatment at
intensive care unit. "Fortunately, we don't have drug-resistant
pneumonia. Simple antibiotics can cure it," Dr Kabra said.

[In the absence of laboratory diagnostics it is difficult to assess
this report. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can cause
mild to severe illness in people of all ages. Signs of pneumonia can
include coughing, fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, rapid breathing or
shortness of breath, chills, or chest pain. Adults 65 years of age or
older and children less than 5 years of age are particularly at risk.

The causes of pneumonia are diverse. The most common bacterial cause
of pneumonia (in North America) is _Streptococcus pneumoniae_
(pneumococcus) and the most common viral causes are influenza virus,
adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. In
children less than 1 year of age, respiratory syncytial virus is the
most common cause of pneumonia.

The pneumonia cases in Chenai appear to have responded to antibiotic
therapy and apparently are not winter-weather related, features that
favour a bacterial infection causation for the Chenai outbreak.
Viruses that have frequently been isolated from children in India
include influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus,
respiratory syncytial virus and human bocavirus. Some or all of these
viruses could be involved. Indeed patients are often co-infected by
combinations of these viral pathogens. Many respiratory virus
infections tend to be winter-related, of such viruses human bocavirus
is probably the least seasonal.

Further information is awaited concerning the etiology of the
outbreak and its geographical extent.

Chenai (formerly Madras) has a population of 4 million plus
inhabitants and is the capital city of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu,
located on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. The HealthMap/
