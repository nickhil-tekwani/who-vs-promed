[We are informed by the rabies centre at the Kimron Veterinary Institute (Veterinary Services and Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture) that the shot, suspected wolf has been diagnosed rabies positive.

The number of rabies cases in animals dropped significantly during 2014 in Israel. The current case, in a wolf, is the 8th case since the start of the year [2014]. The previous cases were: badger (12 Jan 2014), calf (30 Jan 2014), wolf (6 Mar 2014), badger (9 Sep 2014), jackal (11 Sep 2014), fox (23 Sep 2014) and a jackal (9 Nov 2014). The current case in a wolf is, thus, the 8th case this year; as in 6 previous cases, it is located in north eastern Israel (Hazafon district), bordering Syria. One single case (a fox, 23 Sep 2014) was located in southern Israel (Kibbutz Yahel), adjacent to the Jordanian border.
