In Oran, the results of the cause of death of a woman, a resident of Hipolito Yrigoyen, who is a possible case of [a] hantavirus [infection]. The diagnosis will be available in approximately 24 hours, when the results [of laboratory tests] on the samples sent in by the San Vicente de Paul Hospital will be sent from Buenos Aires, according to information issued by that hospital.

The woman died on Monday [22 Oct 2012] in a private clinic in Oran. The 35-year-old woman was sent from the Eva Peron Hospital in Hipolito Yrigoyen due to a prolonged febrile disease.

Se was married and a mother of 3 children who live in the 40 Viviendas neighborhood in that locality.

"Regretfully, this cases was expected based on statistical predictions, especially in this season of the year. These are diseases for which there are no vaccines, so prevention is stressed," Enrique Medina, director of the Yrigoyen Hospital stated to El Tribuno.

He also stated that they are investigating what caused the deterioration of the woman in recent days. "There is a team working on this matter, given that recently we had no locally acquired cases of hantavirus [infections] in the area," stated the official.

So far this year [2012] in the Oran department, there are 20 cases of hantavirus [infections] with 2 deaths, Julio Cortez, Director of the San Vicente de Pau Hospital told El Tribuno. "Statistically, this case fits within predicted [case occurrences]. On average, we see some 24 cases of this disease annually," he stated. He added that the case fatality rate has declined to 19.5 per cent when in the 1980s - 1990s it was 42 per cent.

"In these cases, the diagnosis just serves to provide a statistical [case] index. Give these symptoms, similar to influenza, treatment appropriate for [a] hantavirus [infection] as well as for leptospirosis is carried out. Medical attention during the initial hours of the disease is vital," stated Cortez.

"The hantavirus [disease] is cause by the [a] hantavirus acquired from rodents, whereas leptospirosis is caused by a bacterium that also can be transmitted by pigs, dogs and cows," concluded Cortez.

[The health care providers in Oran are to be congratulated for significantly reducing the case fatality rates for these hantavirus infections. As the above report indicates, prevention is critical. That involves a vigorous and comprehensive public education effort which is not mentioned.

Cases of hantavirus infections have been reported from various parts of Argentina this year (2012). The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the current one, above, are not specified. As noted in ProMED-mail archive number 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but Oran virus seems like a good possibility.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Oran hantavirus, can be seen at http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1260.jpeg.
