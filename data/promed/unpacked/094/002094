Mass disease triggers inspections of North Caucasus garrisons
-----------------------------------------------------
Prosecutors are inspecting all 28 garrisons of the North Caucasus
military district following numerous cases of pneumonia at a local
military training center in Rostov and the death of one soldier,
acting district military prosecutor Anatoly Romashko told a news
conference on Wednesday.
At this point a total of 275 military have been taken ill: 87 have
pneumonia and 89 others acute respiratory viral infection. 12 cadets
are in intensive care, but out of danger.
The inspections are expected to help find an answer to what caused
the disease -- bad conditions, infected food, or sloppy medical
service.
