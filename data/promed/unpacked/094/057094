Belarus: outbreak of serous meningitis in Minsk
-----------------------------------------------
495 cases of enterovirus infection have been registered so far in Minsk
[the capital of Belarus]. According to the Belarus Republic Centre of
Hygiene, Epidemiology and Public Health about 90 of the people affected by
"summer flu" are children. On average about 30 children are being admitted
every day to the children's hospital.
In many cases physicians diagnose serous meningitis, a consequence of
enterovirus infection, which can be transferred through water and food
products. Despite the increased incidence of enteroviral infection, and
serous meningitis in particular, public officials are not considering it an
epidemic . For prevention purposes, chlorination of drinking water has been
undertaken and sanitary and epidemiologic control in food producing
factories is being increased.

Russia: serous meningitis cases in Stavropol reach 20
-----------------------------------------------------
The number of people diagnosed with serous meningitis has increased to 20.
According to the city of Stavropol Epidemiologic Surveillance Centre there
are 3 adults among the 20 infected. The remainder are children aged 10 and
11 years. Serous meningitis is an acute infectious diseases which [is
transmitted by the fecal oral route]. A person can become infected by
swimming in lakes or rivers and accidentally swallowing water. Physicians
are warning the public also to wash fruit and vegetables -- and their hands
-- before eating. Tap water should be boiled during the course of the
outbreak. Serous meningitis is a seasonal infection and is expected to
decrease soon.

[About half to three quarters of cases of meningitis are caused by viruses.
The etiologic agents are mainly enteroviruses (echoviruses, Coxsackie
viruses, and poliovirus), and less frequently mumps virus (transmitted by
droplets and fomites), herpes simplex virus, and adenovirus. In some
countries viral meningitis may be associated with certain arboviruses.
Cases of human infection are commonest in summer months and in the first 10
years of life. The infection in Belarus and Russia described above appear
to be transmitted by the fecal oral route and is likely to associated with
enterovirus infection. The prognosis for viral meningitis is good and
recovery is usually complete. Viral meningitis is sometimes referred to as
aseptic, lymphocytic, or serous meningitis because of the predominance of
lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid. - Mod.CP]
