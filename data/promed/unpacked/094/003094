CHINA'S LACK OF IODINE
[Excerpts
There is a dangerous deficiency that has affected many Chinese children for
generations. The Chinese government has [launched an effort to urge more
people to add more iodine to their diet in the form of iodized salt. It
sounds like it wouldn't be a problem, but the lack of salt can cause
everything from mental retardation to deafness.
"My life has been hard because my children can't work because they're
retarded," says Bai Xiuying. "They can't do farm work or cook or do
housework." When your [livelihood depends on hard labor, and you have many
mouths to feed ... [the only thing that matters is having enough to eat.
Nearly thirty years after the first of her three mentally retarded sons was
born, 68-year old Bai still does not completely understand how it happened,
or that her children's condition was totally [preventable.
Like millions of other women in China, Bai did not get enough iodine in her
diet when she was pregnant. Iodine Deficiency Disorder, also known as
I.D.D., is the leading known preventable cause of mental handicaps
worldwide.
... China's ministry of health has recently concluded that China's entire
population of more than 1.2 billion are living in areas at risk of I.D.D.
Nowhere is that more true than in places like Gansu province where extreme
poverty and soil [depletion are especially common.
"We mostly eat potatoes," explains Bai Xiuying, "That's pretty much it...
Last year it didn't rain, so we didn't have a good potato harvest. There
wasn't much to eat. All of us around here suffered a lot."
Even today, most peasants in this area survive on a diet of boiled potatoes
and noodles. That's it -- no meat and few vegetables. But despite the odds,
the government has predicted it will eliminate I.D.D nationwide by the year
2000. Pregnant women, lactating mothers and children must all take
iodine... And salt factories all over China have been ordered to produced
only iodized salt.
"The cities, in particular, have completely embraced iodized salt. It's
just out in remote countryside, people haven't changed their ideas about
eating non-iodized salt." ... As is the case with so many poor Chinese
peasants, Jian's parents are just barely getting by. In order to save
money, they bought the cheap black market salt. "By not spending 20 extra
cents, you've done this to your children," the doctor tells the father.
"You've got to start buying government approved salt that says iodine on
the package. Once you start using it, the kids necks will go back to normal
very quickly."
In addition to goiters and mental retardation, I.D.D. can also cause
deafness, muteness, and other physical [disabilities. But perhaps the most
potentially devastating symptom of iodine deficiency is often invisible to
the untrained observer. I.D.D. can cause a drop in I.Q. of as much as ten
points. Without proper testing, there's no way of knowing how many children
in China have already suffered, and will continue to suffer silently
because they aren't getting the iodine they need.
