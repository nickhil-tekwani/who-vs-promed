SALMONELLA INFECTIONS, REPTILES: VOLUNTEER INSTITUTE
====================================================

We were looking for places working with Salmonellae associated with
reptiles, particularly boa constrictors and green iguanas. I work at the
Tennessee Aquarium and we are looking for a place that maybe is doing
research on Salmonella and that is looking for animals to use.
We would really appreciate any help. We have been trying for months to find
a place and are rapidly running out of time.
