The last thing the California lettuce industry needs is another
disease, but a new one, _Impatiens necrotic spot virus_ (INSV),
turned up in Salinas Valley fields in 2007.

Steve Koike, Monterey County farm advisor, said that INSV has
symptoms identical to _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV). These
include multiple, brown necrotic spots on leaves and petioles,
resembling pesticide or fertilizer burn. Margins of infected leaves
become wilted and yellowed, and the discoloration is often seen on
new leaves near the center of the plant's growing point.

The disease, which makes heads of infected plants unmarketable, has
been confirmed on iceberg, romaine, and greenleaf lettuces. It has
been found in fields around Castroville, Chualar, Gonzales,
Greenfield, Salinas, and Soledad. Of the 20 or so fields confirmed
with INSV last year [2007], most had infection of less than 5
percent, although several showed 30 percent to 50 percent infection
and significant crop loss.

"INSV," Koike explained, "is a tospovirus, and, like the more
commonly known TSWV, it is vectored by thrips. Typically, INSV is
known to be more of a greenhouse disease concern on flowering
ornamental plants. The infection of lettuce, therefore, is an
apparent departure from this pattern. The exact reasons behind the
INSV outbreak on lettuce are not known. INSV is very difficult to
manage, and if it gets out of hand, you notice it right away."

Koike said there has also been an increase in the incidence of TSWV
on lettuce in the Salinas Valley in the last 2 to 3 years. It was
identified there earlier but was not considered a significant
problem. It was also found last fall [2007] in several lettuce fields
near Huron by Tom Turini, Fresno County farm advisor.

Investigations of both viruses this year [2008] are proposed. Working
with Turini and Bob Gilbertson, University of California, Davis plant
pathologist, Koike hopes to learn the source of INSV and devise
management strategies for it, as well as to monitor developments of
TSWV on lettuce in various parts of the state. At the moment, UC
recommendations for management are to avoid planting next to infected
fields, control of thrips vectors, and crop rotation with
nonsusceptible crops such as small grains.

[_Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV; type species of genus
_Tospovirus_) has one of the broadest host ranges among plant viruses
and is one of few affecting both dicot and monocot hosts. It is
regarded as one of the most economically destructive plant pathogens
and has had a serious impact on many crop species worldwide causing
up to 100 per cent yield loss in some instances. For more information
on TSWV, see links and previous posts listed below.

_Impatiens necrotic spot virus_ (INSV) was considered a strain of
TSWV but has now been classified as a separate species in the genus
_Tospovirus_. It also has a wide host range and has been reported on
crop and ornamental hosts, including lettuce (for example an outbreak
in Italy in 1997, see EPPO data sheet with link below), as well as
potato and peanut in the USA (see previous ProMED-mail posts listed
below). It is widely distributed in Europe and North America and has
also been identified in a few locations elsewhere.

Both INSV and TSWV are transmitted by the western flower thrips
vector _Frankliniella occidentalis_. TSWV is also transmitted by
other species of thrips. Disease management of tospoviruses includes
vector control, use of clean planting material, control of weed hosts
of virus and vectors, phytosanitary measures, and use of resistant
crop cultivars. Both viruses have been placed on the quarantine alert
list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).
