Coagulation factor VIII, which is at 100 percent in normal people, is below one percent in persons with severe hemophilia A. Normal treatment is transfusion of factor VIII concentrate, which is produced from pools of thousands of plasma donations, purified, and virus inactivated.

One liter of fresh frozen plasma raises factor VIII in the recipient by about 20 percentage points. Treatment is limited by the enormous volumes of plasma needed to prevent bleeding. This is why treatment should be, in these cases, by cryoprecipitate (single donor, much lower volume).

Donor plasma (for fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate) may be tested for antibodies against hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). However, plasma concentration of HCV is highest in fresh infections when anti-HCV is still negative. Fresh infections are, for different reasons, much more frequent in commercial blood donors as opposed to voluntary non-remunerated donors. To my knowledge, the Indian blood transfusion system relies heavily on commercial donors. As a result, infection can even be transmitted when testing was correct.

The risk stemming from fresh HCV infection of the donor can be further reduced when donations are, in addition to HCV antibody testing, screened for HCV genomes by RT PCR. This is so expensive that even in Germany, donations are tested in pools, and probably unaffordable for most of India. Even then, infection cannot be completely prevented because the volume transfused is much greater than the volume tested by PCR and may still contain a few viruses not detected by the test.

In resource-poor countries, antibody-testing is frequently done in pools of, for example, 5 donations, but then the sensitivity of the test is reduced, or antibody testing is not done at all.

It would be interesting to know what the actual problem in Kashmir was.
