Minister Eisa Mohamed Mousa told reporters in the Central Darfur capital of Zalingei on [Tue 6 Oct 2015] that 9 people suspected to be afflicted by haemorrhagic fever reached the state's hospitals recently. Of these, 4 died.

He pointed to other Central Darfur localities, especially Wadi Salih, where people, most of them children and the elderly, died of malaria and of a hitherto unknown disease characterised by high fever, severe headache, and vomiting.

Viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a group of illnesses caused by 4 families of viruses. These include Ebola and Marburg, Lassa fever, and yellow fever viruses. Some viruses that cause haemorrhagic fever can spread from one person to another. Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, and Crimean-Congo viruses are examples.

VHFs have common features: they affect many organs, they damage the blood vessels, and they affect the body's ability to regulate itself. While some types of haemorrhagic fever viruses can cause relatively mild illnesses, many of these viruses cause severe, life-threatening disease.

Specific signs and symptoms vary by the type of VHF, but initial signs and symptoms often include marked fever, fatigue, dizziness, muscle aches, loss of strength, and exhaustion. Patients with severe cases of VHF often show signs of bleeding under the skin or from the mouth, eyes, or ears. However, patients rarely die because of blood loss. Severely ill patients may show shock, nervous system malfunction, coma, and seizures.

[Undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever cases have been reported sporadically in various parts of the Sudan, including Darfur, in recent years. Mod.ML commented concerning previous cases, "Hemorrhagic fever can be caused by a variety of viruses that have been known to occur in Sudan. Viral hemorrhagic fever [VHF] can be caused by 4 distinct viral families: arenaviruses (Lassa fever virus), filoviruses (Ebola virus and Marburg virus), bunyaviruses (hantaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [HFRS], Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] virus, Rift Valley fever virus), and flaviviruses (dengue, yellow fever). Most VHFs are zoonoses and the viruses are usually geographically restricted to the areas where their host species live. Certain bacterial infections can also cause hemorrhagic fever, such as scrub typhus, leptospirosis, and plague."

As Mod.ML noted with previous cases, and is relevant to these, "There is no information provided in the report above that suggests any specific virus, nor is it indicated that samples are being taken to permit laboratory diagnosis of the disease. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional information from knowledgeable sources as it becomes available." (see ProMED-mail archive no 20141101.2921031).

Many of the past undiagnosed outbreaks in Darfur occurred in camps of internally displaced refugees. However, in the report above, no mention of these camps was made. There was a serious outbreak of yellow fever (YF) in the Darfur states in 2012-to 2013. If these current cases are due to YF, urgent diagnosis and control measures, especially vaccination, are needed as the situation can get out of hand rapidly, as it did in the previous YF outbreak.
