The state Department of Health reports that an East Mountain woman is
the state's 5th confirmed case of human bubonic plague in 2007.
The 58-year-old woman's plague was confirmed on the night of 27 Sep
2007. She is currently hospitalized and recovering, according to the
department. The 4 other cases of plague confirmed in the state in
2007 occurred in Santa Fe, Torrance, San Juan, and Bernalillo
counties. A Bernalillo County boy died of the disease in June 2007.
Health Department officials are currently working with the
Albuquerque Environmental health department to determine where the
East Mountain woman may have contracted the disease. "We are
determining whether others are at risk, alerting physicians that
plague is in the area, and providing information to neighbors in a
door-to-door educational campaign," state epidemiologist Mack Sewell
said in a news release.
Previous plague cases in 2007 have been associated with flea bites,
according to the health department. Sewell suggests that people use a
flea control product on their pets to minimize the likelihood off
introducing fleas to their environments.
New Mexico experienced 8 human plague cases in 2006, 2 of them fatal;
4 cases were reported in 2005. There [were] no reported cases of
human plague in 2004.
