5 Namibians treated for suspected anthrax
---------------------------------------
5 people in Namibia's Caprivi strip region have been admitted to hospital
with suspected anthrax, which has killed elephants, buffalo and zebras in
the south-west African country, officials said. Health and Social Services
Deputy Minister Richard Kamwi said the 5, all believed to have come into
contact with infected animals, were admitted to the Katima Mulilo State
Hospital and were in a stable condition.
"All 5 (4 adults and a 10-year-old child) are suffering from skin anthrax.
They have skin sores with black centers. This is really typical of anthrax
skin infection," said Michael Likando, of the Caprivi Health Directorate.
"The main mission is to ask residents not to eat or touch meat of any
animal, be it wild or domestic, that died of unknown causes," he said.
An anthrax outbreak was reported in eastern Caprivi in September 2004, and
Namibian officials suspected it spread across the border from neighbouring
Botswana's Chobe National Park. Sackey Namugongo, Deputy Director for Parks
and Wildlife Management, said the outbreak, which had killed around 20
animals, was now under control.
Botswana's anthrax outbreak has killed about 260 animals.
