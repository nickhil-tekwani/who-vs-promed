[4] Cholera - Somalia
Date: Mon 15 Oct 2007

The United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) has warned of an
imminent risk of cholera in southern Somalia. Seven new cases have
been confirmed so far in the capital, Mogadishu, as well as in
Berdale and Burhakaba.

WHO says the new cases represent an even more serious threat than the
outbreak that occurred 3 months ago and which affected more than 37
000 people and led to over 1100 deaths. The UN Children's Fund
(UNICEF) has begun delivering cholera kits and oral re-hydration
therapy supplies to the area.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)
reports that the flood alert was raised from moderate to high on the
Shabelle and Juba rivers following significant rainfall in South
Somalia and the Ethiopian highlands where the 2 rivers originate. An
inter-agency mission to assess the situation and possible
interventions are being planned. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that, in a 2-way flow of displaced
persons, nearly 31 000 people have fled ongoing insecurity, sporadic
violence and looting in Mogadishu since the beginning of September
2007, while nearly 800 internally displaced persons (IDPs) returned
to the Somali capital. In addition, nearly 7300 residents and IDPs
have been evicted from their homes in government and public buildings
since June 2007, according to UNHCR's Population Movement Tracking.

Somalia, which has had no functioning central government since the
regime of Muhammad Siad Barre was toppled in 1991, has seen renewed
fighting since the beginning of 2007, after the Ethiopian-backed
Transitional Federal Government (TFG) drove the Union of the Islamic
Courts (UIC) out of Mogadishu and most of the rest of the country in
December 2006. Since the onset of fighting in January 2007, UNHCR
reports that between February and May 2007, about 400 000 IDPs moved
from Mogadishu, with about 125 000 returning between April and June
2007. Since June 2007, nearly 85 000 people have moved from the
capital.

34 cases of cholera, resulting in 10 deaths were reported over the

Kwanza Sul province. According to the balance report of the municipal
health division, made available to ANGOP this Mon 15 Oct 2007, the
cases were registered in the outskirts of Wako-Kungo city.

The note also stated that local health officials are actively engaged
in tracking down cholera cases in the region, conducting house to
house distribution of calcium hypochlorite, sensitizing the
communities on the dangers of the epidemic disease, as well as
holding some upgrading courses to benefit technicians, chieftains and
religious authorities, among others.

[6] Cholera, diarrhea - Nigeria (Bauchi)

About 7 people have died in Bauchi State owing to a gastroenteritis
outbreak, while over 60 people are currently infected with the
disease in the state. This was disclosed by the Secretary of Nigeria
Red Cross Society Bauchi State Chapter, Alhaji Adamu Abubakar. He
stated further that those infected with the deadly disease are
receiving treatment in various health institutions in the state as a
result, a development which, according to him, can degenerate into
cholera if not taken care of quickly [Does this imply that it is
already cholera? - Mod.LL].

The secretary further warned the Bauchi state government to stand
against the spread of cholera in the state in order to avoid the 2005
experience that led to the loss of many people in the state and much
suffering.
