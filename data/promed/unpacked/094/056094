Brucellosis in sheep has been recorded in the Tula region
---------------------------------------------------------
Brucellosis has been revealed in a sheep breeding farm in the Belevsky district [Tula oblast]. The disease was confirmed by laboratory tests.

Brucellosis is a disease transmitted from infected animals to man. Human infection occurs through direct contact with animals, through contaminated premises or by eating contaminated food -- such as raw milk and cheese made from unpasteurized milk.

[_Brucella melitensis_ (biovars 1, 2 or 3) is the main causative agent of caprine and ovine brucellosis. It is endemic in the Mediterranean region, but infection is widespread world-wide; the disease is present in many of Russia's oblasts (led by Stavropol, Dagstan, Astrakhan and Khakasiya).

Clinically, the disease in animals (goats and sheep) is characterised by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis, epididymitis and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Diagnosis depends on the isolation of _Brucella_ from abortion material, udder secretions or from tissues removed at post-mortem. Presumptive diagnosis of _Brucella_ infection can be made by assessing specific cell-mediated or serological responses to _Brucella_ antigens.

_B. melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans, causing Malta fever, one of the most serious zoonoses globally. All infected tissues, cultures and potentially contaminated materials should therefore be handled at containment level 3. Brucellosis in cattle is generally caused by _B. abortus_.

During 2012 (last available report), 465 human cases of brucellosis, primarily caused by _B. melitensis_, were officially reported by the Russian authorities to the OIE (0.3242 per 100 000 population).

At present, brucellosis is still reported from all types of farms and domestic livestock in Russia, including strains of _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _B. suis_ and _B. ovis_. Tula oblast is situated about 200 km (about 124 miles) south of Moscow. The last _B. melitensis_ outbreak in small ruminants was reported there in 2011; no new cases were reported during 2012 and the 1st 6 months of 2013 (last available semi-annual report).

Sheep and goats in Russia are vaccinated against _B. melitensis_ primarily by the Rev.1 vaccine. In about 20 percent of the vaccinations, 'Strain 19' vaccine is used. Additional information is available in Ref 1.
