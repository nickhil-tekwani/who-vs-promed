Outbreak of _Shigella sonnei_ infection in Norway linked to
consumption of fresh basil, October 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Guzman-Herrador B, Vold L, Comelli H, et al]

We report a _Shigella sonnei_ outbreak of 46 cases that occurred in
Norway during October 2011. 2 municipalities were involved. A large
cluster (42 cases) was concentrated in north Norway, while a small
cluster (4 cases) occurred in the south-east region. Epidemiological
evidence and traceback investigations have linked the outbreak to the
consumption of imported fresh basil. The product has been withdrawn
from the market. No further cases have been reported since 25 Oct
2011.

Outbreak description
--------------------
On 9 Oct 2011, the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at
the Norwegian Institute of Public Health was informed by the municipal
medical officer and the Local Food Safety Authority in Tromso
(northern Norway) about an unusually high number of cases of
gastrointestinal disease caused by _S. sonnei_. A delicatessen and
catering company located in the center of Tromso received several
complaints from customers who had fallen ill with gastrointestinal
symptoms after having eaten food items from there. On 14 Oct 2011, a
small cluster of cases who had not been to Tromso were reported and
the outbreak was classified as national.

An outbreak case was defined as a person with gastrointestinal
symptoms with laboratory confirmed infection with _S. sonnei_ with
indistinguishable multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeats
analysis (MLVA) profiles in Norway after 1 Oct 2011.

As of 2 Nov 2011, 46 cases have been reported (Figure - for figure,
see source URL above. - Mod.LL). The outbreak-MLVA profile had not
previously been seen in Norway. The cases are distributed in 2
clusters: 42 cases live in Tromso in the north of Norway or had been
to Tromso within the incubation period of the disease (up to 7 days)
(1,2), and 4 cases live in a municipality (Ostfold) in south-east
Norway, without any connection to Tromso. None of the cases had
travelled outside the country. All cases are adults (aged 19-84 years)
and males and females are equally affected. No new cases have been
reported since 25 Oct 2011.

Shigellosis is the 3rd most frequent bacterial gastrointestinal
infection reported in Norway. In the last 10 years, between 120 and
190 cases have been registered annually (about 2.5 per 100 000
inhabitants to 4.0 per 100 000 inhabitants). Most of the cases (80-90
percent) are travel-related. _S. sonnei_ is the most frequent species
identified (64 percent of all isolates in 2010) (3).

Investigation into the outbreak
-------------------------------
On 9 Oct 2011, the municipal medical officer in Tromso initiated an
investigation in collaboration with the local Food Safety Authority in
order to identify the source of the outbreak. The local Food Safety
Authority interviewed 38 of the 42 laboratory-confirmed cases in
Tromso: most of them had participated in social events after 30 Sep
2011 where food provided by the catering company in question had been
served. Of the 38 cases interviewed, 36 reported to have eaten pesto
containing basil. The catering company provided a complete list of all
the events for which they had served food from 30 Sep 2011, which was
followed up by the local Food Safety Authority.

One of those events was a baptism ceremony banquet celebrated on 1-2
Oct 2011. Of the 50 attendees, 10 people became sick with
gastrointestinal symptoms. Among the sick, 3 had laboratory-confirmed
infection with _S. sonnei_. In collaboration with the local
authorities, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health performed a
cohort study among the attendees of the banquet in order to identify
risk factors for illness. A link to a web-based questionnaire designed
to collect information on demographics, symptoms, and food exposures
from the menu was sent by email to 42 of the attendees. All of them
responded. Preliminary results from the cohort study show that 2
products, a pesto and a soup, were independently associated with
illness. However, only the pesto was delivered by the catering company
and could be linked to the other cases occurring in Tromso.

On 11 Oct 2011, the 1st case in the small cluster of 4 cases in a
municipality in the south of the country with MLVA profiles
indistinguishable identical to the Tromso profile was identified. 3
had been served food containing basil in a specific restaurant.

Traceback investigations of ingredients in the pesto served in Tromso
are still ongoing. The same distributor that provided the fresh basil
to the catering company in Tromso also delivered fresh basil to the
restaurant implicated in the 2nd cluster in south-east Norway. The
distributor imported this herb from a country outside the European
Union and has voluntarily withdrawn it from the market. The National
Veterinary Institute analyzed samples of pesto and other ingredients
from the catering company in Tromso. Samples available for analysis
have been negative. An epidemic intelligence information system (EPIS)
enquiry has been posted to determine whether other European countries
have observed a similar increase in cases infected with _S. sonnei_.
So far, no other countries have reported any recent increase in cases
that can be linked to this outbreak.

Conclusion and recommendations
------------------------------
We report an outbreak of _S. sonnei_ in Norway, linked to imported
basil used fresh in pesto. The ingestion of very few organisms
(10-100) is sufficient to cause infection (4). Pesto usually contains
a substantial amount of basil. Thus, if this herb is contaminated with
the bacteria, ingesting very small quantities of pesto can lead to a
high risk of getting the infection.

Each year there are a considerable number of outbreaks of shigellosis
around the world due to consumption of contaminated food. The
contamination of foods with _Shigella_ usually results from
contaminated irrigation water, infected food handlers or improper
preparation (5,6). The sources of many shigellosis outbreaks have been
traced to the ingestion of raw or fresh vegetables (6). In Norway, for
example, iceberg lettuce was incriminated in a _S. sonnei_ outbreak in
1994 (7). Previous domestic outbreaks of _S. sonnei_ infection in
Scandinavia have been also linked to imported products (8).

Food handlers with gastrointestinal symptoms should avoid involvement
with the preparation, management, and transport of food while they are
symptomatic in order to prevent spread of the pathogen, and they
should also adhere to appropriate hygiene and hand-washing routines.
Control measures to protect fresh vegetables from air, soil or water
contamination should be ensured.

[Most cases of shigellosis present with an incubation period less than
48 hours. The classic presentation is bacillary dysentery, fever and
chills, diarrheal stools with blood and mucus, and tenesmus (abdominal
pain while passing the diarrhea). The disease spreads more easily from
person-to-person because lower number of organisms than most other
enteric pathogens can cause infection.

The report does not mention the extra-EU country from which the basil
was imported and also whether it is known if the vehicle was exported
to other countries in Europe or elsewhere.

Basil, or sweet basil, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil) is a
common name for the culinary herb _Ocimum basilicum_, of the family
Lamiaceae (mints). Originally from India, basil is best known as a
culinary herb prominently featured in Italian cuisine, and also plays
a major role in the Northeast Asian cuisine of Taiwan and the
Southeast Asian cuisines of Thailand, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Laos.
Depending on the species and cultivar, the leaves may taste somewhat
like anise, with a strong, pungent, often sweet smell. There are many
varieties of _Ocimum basilicum_, as well as several related species or
species hybrids also called basil. The type used in Italian food is
typically called sweet basil, as opposed to Thai basil (_O. basilicum_
var. _thyrsiflora_), lemon basil (_O. x citriodorum_), and holy basil
(_O. tenuiflorum_), which are used in Asia. While most common
varieties of basil are treated as annuals, some are perennial in warm,
tropical climates, including holy basil and a cultivar known as
'African Blue'.
