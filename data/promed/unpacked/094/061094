Fair pledges changes after virus kills cows
-------------------------------------------
To avoid any future outbreaks, animals will be kept separate, officials
said. Puyallup Fair officials plan to make changes in the way animals are
exhibited following the deaths of about 20 cattle, including 3 owned by an
Arlington family, killed by a virus they probably caught from lambs shown
at the fair.

The state veterinarian, fair managers, and Washington State University
veterinarians are investigating a rare outbreak of the deadly viral disease
mostly among cows shown by Future Farmers of America [FFA] clubs at
September's [2008] fair. Lambs housed in the same barn as the cattle
probably spread ovine herpesvirus 2, which is carried in their nasal
secretions. The virus causes malignant catarrhal fever. Sheep are not
affected by the disease, but there is no treatment for cattle and other
susceptible animals including deer, bison, and hogs. Now, Puyallup Fair
officials are planning to separate the animals. They will either be kept in
different buildings, or students will show cattle during the 1st part of
the fair, and sheep will be shown at the end, fair spokeswoman Karen
LaFlamme said.

About 133 cattle were housed with lambs in the fair's dairy barn complex
this year [2008]. Of those, 88 were owned by FFA students, 33 were
open-class Highland beef cattle, and another 12 were dairy cows brought in
by a Buckley farmer for milking demonstrations. Of those milking cows 3
died. The rest of the cows that died belonged to FFA families: 3 in
Arlington, 7 in Lynden, 2 in Rainier, and one each in Fife, Elma, Sequim,
and Centralia.

The state veterinary office has never seen a malignant catarrhal fever
outbreak like this one, and many veterinarians in the state have never seen
an MCF-related death, said Dr Leonard Eldridge, the state veterinarian. No
quarantine actions have been taken since the discovery of the outbreak
because cattle do not spread it to humans or to other cattle. No food
safety issues are related to the disease, he said.

The International Association of Fairs and Expositions has no record of any
of its member fair groups experiencing this type of loss, and many of those
fairs have barns that are shared by sheep and cattle, LaFlamme said. The
Evergreen State Fair in Monroe has separate barns for sheep and cattle,
Evergreen manager Mark Campbell said. "We don't know much about MCF, but we
plan to learn as much as we can and take precautions to prevent something
of this nature from happening in Monroe," Campbell said. "We are anxious to
find out the results of the state's investigation to see if we need to make
any changes here."

Puyallup Fair officials notified open class exhibitors of the outbreak in a
letter sent [20 Nov 2008] and asked FFA officials to contact chapter
advisers and ask them to talk to their students, LaFlamme said. The disease
normally develops after 30 to 60 days, and the first the fair heard of the
outbreak was on 13 Nov 2008, she said. Al Schwider, state FFA
superintendent, said he plans to keep in touch with all the FFA students
who showed cattle at the Puyallup Fair.

[According to the Merck Veterinary Manual [edited]:

"The principal carriers and their viruses are sheep (ovine herpesvirus-2),
wildebeest (alcelaphine herpesvirus-1), and goats (caprine herpesvirus-2).
Another strain of unidentified origin has caused MCF in white-tailed deer.
Virtually all clinical cases are caused by the sheep or wildebeest viruses.

"The viruses are maintained within the sheep and wildebeest populations in
similar but not identical patterns. Lambs are infected usually at 1-2 mo of
age by aerosol transmission from other individuals within the flock and
begin to actively shed virus at approximately 6 mo of age. Shedding
decreases at approximately 10 mo, with adults shedding at a much lower rate
than adolescents. Wildebeest calves, in contrast, are infected in the
perinatal period by horizontal and occasional intrauterine transmission,
and actively shed virus until 3-4 mo of age. Transmission is by transfer of
virus-laden nasal secretions by direct contact or poorly defined airborne
routes. In Africa, most wildebeest-associated MCF is seen around the time
of calving; however, sheep-associated MCF (SA-MCF) does not follow the same
pattern. Ewes do not shed virus in placental tissues or secretions and do
not experience more frequent shedding episodes around lambing time. The
only rational and established factors contributing to seasonality of SA-MCF
are climatic influences on virus survival and the age-related shedding
patterns in lambs. The epidemiology of the caprine MCF virus appears
similar to that of sheep.

"The severity of SA-MCF outbreaks depends on factors such as the total
numbers, population density, and species of susceptible hosts involved; the
closeness of contact; and the amount of shed virus available for
transmission. Cases usually are seen sporadically in European breeds of
cattle (_Bos taurus_), as they are a relatively resistant species. By
contrast, Bali cattle, bison, and some but not all cervid species (such as,
white-tailed deer, Pere David's deer) are highly susceptible. As
agricultural systems involving bison and deer production have developed,
MCF has become more troublesome. It is a leading cause of infectious
disease losses on New Zealand deer farms. In bison exposed to large numbers
of adolescent sheep, losses can be devastating. About 800 head died in one
outbreak in the USA in 2003.

"Among animals that survive, infection is lifelong; some susceptible
species may be latently infected. Recrudescence of latent infections is
common and must be considered for cases with no known history of contact
with carriers."

Not a risk to be taken lightly. Kids get animal handling experience and
training preparing animals for the FFA shows and competitions. So by
definition they will be bringing large numbers of young sheep and goats to
shows. Farmers' kids will be bringing yearling cattle. A potentially
explosive mix as we saw here. And as bison herds increase in North America
we will see yet more outbreaks in that species too. - Mod.MHJ
