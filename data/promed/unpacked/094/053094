The 1st case of EEE [eastern equine encephalitis] was detected in an animal this year [2014], state health officials announced Thursday [14 Aug 2014].

That infection was found in a deer in Freetown, which raised the town's EEE risk level to high and prompted the Department of Public Health to recommend that any outdoor community events scheduled between dusk and dawn should be moved to a different time.

The risk level for surrounding towns has been raised to moderate.

So far this year [2014], there have been no cases of West Nile or EEE in humans.

[Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is caused by an arthropod-borne group A alphavirus of the _Togaviridae_ family. It is primarily known to affect horses and humans in the eastern United States, but it is maintained in nature by infection of wild birds. Serological evidence suggests that numerous species of birds are exposed to this virus.

Sporadic cases of EEE in white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) have been reported previously in Michigan, Georgia, and Wisconsin.
