[I requested data from Dr. Garcia in response to the posting Leptospirosis
- Germany ex Dominican Rep. 20010615.1154. He has been kind enough to
provide information to ProMED-mail in the past on leptospirosis in the
Dominican Republic and here provides us with the information, below. - Man.
Ed. DS
I would like to give you information regarding the data on the diagnosis of
human leptospirosis during the year 2000 and the first 3 months of the 2001.
Our Unit of Leptospirosis of the Central Veterinary Lab is only one that
makes the Micro-Agglutination Test (MAT) and culture for _Leptospira_ in
our country.
During this period, a total of 643 human serum samples were submitted for
the MAT from the entire country.
40 serum samples reacted with serovar _icterohaemorrhagiae_
25 serum samples reacted with serovar _pomona_
21 serum samples reacted with serovar _canicola_
9 serum samples reacted with serovar _tarassovi_
8 serum samples reacted with serovar _hardjo_
6 serum samples reacted with serovar _grippotyphosa_
4 serum samples reacted with serovar _wolffi_
1 serum samples reacted with serovar _automnalis_
1 serum samples reacted with serovar _pyrogenes_
They came from:
National District: 34 positive samples
Santiago: 7 positive samples
Puerto Plata: 5 positive samples
San Cristobal: 2 positive samples
Elias Pina: 2 positive samples
Azua: 1 positive sample
Bani: 1 positive sample
Moca: 1 positive sample
Valverde: 1 positive sample
Monte Plata: 1 positive sample
Hato Mayor: 1 positive sample

Culture for _Leptospira_ gave positive results in 5 of 23 urine samples
sent to the lab for isolation.
