Schmallenberg virus spreads to the mountain area
------------------------------------------------
In Switzerland, a new disease is spreading to more regions. Schmallenberg virus [SBV] causes malformations in calves, lambs and goat kids. It has now for the 1st time appeared in the mountainous area. In Puschlav [in Italian, Valposchiavo; a southern, Italian speaking, part of the Swiss canton Graubunden], several animals were found to be infected on a farm more than 1000 meters [3280 feet] above sea level.

The spread to this altitude is highly unusual, as the virus is transmitted by a tropical mosquito [see comment], Regula Kennel, spokeswoman of the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office (FVO), has reported to the Regional Journal Graubunden, Swiss radio and television.

According to the Graubunden cantonal veterinarian Rolf Hanimann, it has been assumed that the SBV spread in mountain areas will not become an issue. Since its 1st appearance in Switzerland in July this year [2012], the SBV has spread to several cantons of Midland and Eastern Switzerland, but so far no Alp Cantons have been affected.

Up to now, the virus was confirmed on 124 Swiss farms. In cattle, either the virus itself or antibodies against SBV were found. While the virus in adult animals only leads to temporary, flu-like symptoms, in pregnant animals it can cause abortion, stillbirth and severe malformations of the offspring. The extent of these effects is still to be seen. As the virus has only recently been confirmed in the country, so far only 6 malformed calves have tested positive for the virus. For the upcoming lambing season in the fall and the calving season in spring, the BVET expects an increase in cases of congenital malformations.

"Every farm with positive test results must expect malformations in upcoming births," the spokeswoman of the BVET, Ms. Kennel, said. But she doesn't want to dramatize the situation. The virus only causes damage when an animal becomes infected for the 1st time, and only if infected during a certain period of the pregnancy. Later, animals become immune and re-infection causes no problems. The disease is not contagious and is not transmitted from animal to animal. For humans, the virus is harmless.

"SBVs belongs to a known family, but it is a new virus," Kennel said. It was discovered in the summer of 2011 in the north German town of Schmallenberg. Since then it has spread in a broad band across Europe towards the Southeast. At the moment there is neither a treatment nor a vaccine available.

[The reference to "tropical mosquitos" is in need of clarification. So far, SBV has been detected only in midges (culicoides). However, the entomological aspects of this disease are clearly in need of further research.

The location of the case described is shown on the updated FVO SBV map, available at http://www.bvet.admin.ch/gesundheit_tiere/01065/04051/index.html?lang=de.

Neighbouring countries to the east of infected zones in Germany and Switzerland have not reported SBV so far. - Mod.AS
