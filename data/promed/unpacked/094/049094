6000 chickens die in bird flu outbreak in southern Vietnam
--------------------------------------------------
After 2 months with no reports of large bird flu outbreaks, 6000 birds have
been killed by the virus in southern Vietnam, a veterinary official said on
Saturday [18 Jun 2005].
"700 chickens on a farm in An Khanh commune in Ben Tre province were culled
last Saturday [probably 11 Jun 2005] after 6000 of them had died within 4
days", said Mai Van Hiep, director of the province's veterinary department.
"Test samples of the fowls were positive for H5 virus".
The last reported large outbreak was in mid-April 2005, but smaller
outbreaks have been continually occurring since then, a veterinary official
said.
"Actually, Vietnam [has] never announced the termination of bird flu", said
Hoang Van Nam, deputy director of the animal health department of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. "Outbreaks, with large or
small numbers of fowl, are still scattered throughout the country".
On Friday [17 Jun 2005], a senior health official said a number of
suspected human-to-human cases of H5N1 had been detected by the National
Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology.
"We have got a number of suspected cases of human-to-human transmission of
bird flu, including a doctor from Bach Mai hospital", Nguyen Tran Hien, the
director of the institute, told Deutsche Presse-Agentur. "We will need to
do more research before coming to any conclusion".
The World Health Organization (WHO) has long warned that if the H5N1 virus
mutates into a form that is easily spreadable between people, millions
could die worldwide in the resulting pandemic.
"Every incident needs to be rapidly and thoroughly investigated, both as to
whether human-to-human transmission has occurred and more importantly to
confirm whether that transmission was efficient, which might indicate that
the risk of the spread of avian influenza in the human population has
increased," said Peter Horby, a WHO epidemiologist working in Vietnam.
Since reports began appearing in late 2003, 38 people have died from the
virus in Vietnam.
The 1st wave of the virus saw it spread to 57 of Vietnam's 64 provinces and
cities. During the 2nd wave from the end of 2004 and April 2005, the virus
has affected bird populations in 36 provinces and cities, and 1.6 million
birds have died or been culled.
As well as outbreaks in chickens, health experts warned that ducks are a
silent carrier of the virus. They can carry the virus without showing any
symptoms.
A ban on the raising of waterfowl is routinely flouted and flocks continue
to roam in the countryside.

[The continued recording of human avian influenza cases in Vietnam
indicates the continued presence of the (probably unreported) disease in
domestic avians. Vietnam's last (13th) follow-up report to the OIE on avian
influenza was sent on 28 Feb 2005. A fresh report will be welcomed.
A new (17 Jun 2005) update of the OIE on the disease situation in all
countries affected with the H5 serotype in Asia can be accessed at
