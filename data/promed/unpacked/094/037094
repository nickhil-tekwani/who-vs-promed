A Belgium government spokesman told Reuters 2 large incineration plants had
started working around the clock to burn slaughtered animals and products
sourced to farms supplied with animal feed tainted with dioxins, chemicals
linked to cancer.
But it remains far from clear if Belgium has done enough to reassure
rattled consumers and trading partners. One problem is that the exact
source of the contamination remains a mystery.
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, fighting for his political life ahead of a
general election Sunday, went on the offensive, insisting produce could be
guaranteed dioxin free. [What about free of polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs?
The tainted animal feed has possibly spread to thousands of farms, mostly
in Belgium but some in France and the Netherlands. The authorities have
drawn up lists of affected farms, and product from these holdings must be
traced and destroyed.
Products from other farms have been cleared for sale again.
Belgian retailers said they could see ``light at the end of the tunnel'' as
chickens returned to the shops Friday.
But angry farmers in Britain tried to block the port of Felixstowe
overnight, worried dioxin-tainted meat was being imported into the country
from the continent.
Meanwhile, Belgian farmers and butchers continued their protests on roads
between Belgium and the Netherlands and France in a bid to halt meat
imports, which have surged amid domestic confusion about what is and is not
safe to eat.
The German state of Hesse said Friday some Belgian meat imported into
Germany before the recent scare was found to contain high levels of toxic
PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) -- man-made chemicals that create dioxins
when heated.
The United States (US) has maintained its embargo on all European Union
(EU) pork and poultry products, and more countries have joined the growing
list of destinations where Belgian farm goods are not welcome.
China said it would discuss the dioxin affair with visiting EU officials,
having already banned Belgian, Dutch, French and German meat and dairy
products.
The European Commission (EC) has said it is less than happy with the way
Belgium has handled the crisis, and criticized it for leaving milk and some
dairy products such as cheese on sale. [Realistically, are those from
January, even from May, still going to be on the market shelves?
Dehaene said tests on milk and dairy products had been done and EU
restrictions on their sale should not apply.
EC Affairs Commissioner Emma Bonino said EU experts would evaluate Belgian
scientific evidence that milk was safe Wednesday.
Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler announced member state veterinarians had
approved a single export certificate, which could clear the way for Belgium
to restart shipments of meat and dairy products guaranteed free of dioxin
from Saturday. [No mention of free from PCBs?
He said he hoped the move would help rebuild confidence. "There will be one
clear certificate which has to accompany all these products. This will show
all our provisions have been complied with and if that is so, then there is
no problem."
Fischler said he saw "absolutely no reason" for countries such as the US to
maintain their blanket bans on meat products from all EU countries.
The alert has brought the spotlight onto what is fed to animals and sparked
renewed calls for an EU-wide ban on using meat and bone meal in animal
feed, a move likely to be discussed by EU agriculture ministers in
Luxembourg Monday and Tuesday.

[This article mentions that chickens are returning to the markets for sale
and that effective tomorrow EU "member state veterinarians had approved a
single export certificate, which could clear the way for Belgium to restart
shipments of meat and dairy products guaranteed free of dioxin from
Saturday." The details of the criteria for issuing the certificate are not
given. Checking the EU website <http://europa.eu.int> did not produce
further information on this. Provided by MPP. - Mod.TG
