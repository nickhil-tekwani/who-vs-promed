Abstract
Using a data-linkage approach, we conducted a case-control study to investigate risk factors in an outbreak of anthrax infection among Scottish heroin users. Factors associated with an increased risk of infection included longer injecting history, receiving opioid substitution therapy, and alcohol consumption. Smoking heroin was associated with lower risk of infection [But not without risk - Mod.MHJ].

Discussion
By using a record-linkage approach to generate case-control data, we have identified selected risk factors for anthrax infection in the recent Scottish outbreak. This approach was used because it was not possible to undertake a traditional case-control study due to logistic constraints, and because the information collected during the anthrax outbreak investigation did not have controls for comparison. We found that longer injecting history, receiving OST, and alcohol consumption were positively associated with anthrax infection. We also found that only smoking heroin was associated with lower risk of infection. The risk factors identified in this study are consistent with the hypotheses developed, but not formally confirmed, in the investigation of the anthrax outbreak.

Notably, we did not find an association between sharing injecting equipment and anthrax infection. This is consistent with other evidence, described in the outbreak report, which strongly points to the heroin itself as the source of infection. The latter is also supported by the observed correlation between length of injecting and infection: whereas we might have expected younger, less experienced drug users -- who tend to engage in riskier behaviour -- to have a greater burden of infection, the opposite was observed. Older age/longer injecting career have previously been implicated in bacterial soft tissue infections among injectors, which may have been explained by the higher propensity for older individuals to inject into the skin/muscle, an anaerobic environment in which _Clostridia_ species proliferate. Since _B. anthracis_ is aerobic, this is perhaps less likely to be the case here.

The association between anthrax and longer injecting career may reflect the poorer health and, therefore, greater susceptibility to infection of long-term drug users. Similarly, the association between alcohol and anthrax may reflect higher susceptibility to infection due to alcohol's immuno-suppressive effects.

With regard to route of heroin administration and risk of infection, it is conceivable that the intravenous administration of heroin is more conducive to the germination of spores and proliferation of vegetative organisms than smoking/inhaling heroin. However, inhalation of anthrax spores via heroin inhalation/smoking is a biologically plausible route of infection, and evidence from the outbreak case histories verified that infection did occur in non-injecting heroin users, including at least one fatal case.

The finding that those who were currently receiving OST were more likely to have had anthrax was significant, even after adjustment for time since onset of injecting. Nevertheless, there may still be residual confounding, and this association may simply reflect the more problematic and long-standing drug use of the anthrax cases, since the likelihood of being in treatment for drug use increases with increasing length and severity of drug use.

This study has a number of limitations. Firstly, because the linked data was from a preexisting source (i.e. it was not collected with the specific purpose of investigating the anthrax outbreak), we were limited to examining the data that are collected for drug misuse treatment.

Secondly, there was a long time delay between SDMD registration and anthrax onset for many of the cases. Thus, the behaviour that was recorded during an individual's historical attendance at a treatment facility may not be representative of his/her behaviour in the period immediately preceding onset of anthrax illness. Nevertheless, studies have demonstrated that drug-taking behaviour can be consistent over time, particularly among long-term heroin users, who are highly represented among our linked anthrax cases.

Thirdly, there was a large amount of missing data in the drug treatment records; thus, the current study was likely underpowered to detect some associations.

Fourthly, 17 anthrax cases did not link to the SDMD. Plausible reasons for this could be: incomplete coverage of drug treatment services by the SDMD; that the cases had never received treatment for drug misuse; or inaccuracies in the identifying information used for record linkage. The predominance of non-linkers from the West of Scotland, and Glasgow in particular (9 of the non-linkers), likely reflects an issue with completeness of reporting of data to the SDMD in this area since mid-2009 due to the introduction of an electronic system (Andrew Deas, ISD, personal communication, 2012). To verify whether the exclusion of these cases would bias our findings, we compared data on injecting/smoking heroin in the week prior to anthrax onset and found no statistically significant difference between the linkers and nonlinkers (5 percent of linkers vs. 0 percent of non-linkers had only smoked heroin, P=0.64).

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a method of using routinely collected data to enable a case-control analysis where otherwise this would not be possible, which can be used to support hypotheses and/or corroborate the findings of other investigations (e.g. epidemiological, clinical, microbiological, criminal justice). Understanding the risk factors for anthrax infection may help to inform risk communication in future outbreaks of anthrax or other bacterial infections affecting drug users.
