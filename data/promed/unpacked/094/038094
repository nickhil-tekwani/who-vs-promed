Area salmonella outbreak climbs to 22 cases, several hospitalized
---------------------------------------------------
The number of salmonella cases stemming from an outbreak at a Mexican
restaurant in East Alton has more than doubled since last week. The
Madison County Health Department reported Mon, 13 Jun 2005, that 22
confirmed cases of salmonella have been linked to Casa Romero Restaurant at
521 E. Airline Drive in East Alton.
Last week the department said restaurant owners volunteered to temporally
close the establishment on 3 Jun 2005, after 10 people reported getting
sick while eating at the restaurant. Attempts to reach the restaurant
owners Monday were unsuccessful.
The 22 people visited the restaurant between 21 May and 3 Jun 2005, said
Public Health Administrator Tina Corona. She said "several" of those
infected are employees of the restaurant, but she did not specify how many.
"It looks like the original transmission was from an infected person, but
to find out exactly where it came from is nearly impossible," Corona said.
Corona said several people infected with the bacteria were hospitalized,
but she declined to specify how many. She said the restaurant will remain
closed until a lab report is concluded, basic food safety is explained to
employees, and all employees have tested negative for salmonella.
"We haven't stamped out a date to reopen the restaurant," Corona said.
The Health Department inspects the restaurant at least 3 times a year.
During the last inspection, which was 28 Feb 2005, the restaurant received
a score of 95 out of 100, with no critical health violations.

Williston woman dies of salmonella; others sickened
---------------------------------------------------
A woman here has died of salmonella poisoning and other people have been
sickened, the state Health Department says. The woman was not immediately
identified. State Epidemiologist Kirby Kruger said she was older than 65.
She was among 3 people in an extended family who ate food from the same
source and became sick, he said.
One other person also became sick after eating the same precooked food from
the same retail business, Kruger said. That person, along with the other 2
members of the family, were recovering, he said.
The Health Department did not identify the business or classify its type,
saying it had not been cited. "We did an environmental investigation at
the business. No major deficiencies were found," Kruger said.
2 of the people who were sickened were between the ages of 30 and 65, and
the other 2 were older then 65. The Health Department began investigating 2
Jun 2005.
Kruger said on 13 Jun 2005 that 2 other reports of people being sickened by
salmonella came in over the weekend, but officials had not yet determined
if those people had gotten food from the same business as the others.
"At this point we don't believe there's any danger (to any other people),"
Kruger said Mon, 13 Jun 2005. "We're still investigating."
