2002/073 Surveys on potato bacteria in Slovakia: harvest 2001
For the last 5 years, systematic surveys on _Clavibacter
michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ [Cms] and _Ralstonia
solanacearum_ [Rs] (both EPPO A2 quarantine pests) [were] ... carried
out in Slovakia. Field/store inspections and laboratory testing were
performed on the 2001 potato harvest. Detection methods were used in
accordance with EU Directives 93/85/EEC and 98/57/EC.
During this survey, the following ... samples were tested:
- 454 samples of domestic seed potatoes (corresponding to the whole
Slovak production, i.e. 2565,5 ha [European terminology] 2,565.5 ha
[UK or USA terminology]
- 61 samples of domestic ware potatoes (corresponding to [8.5
percent] of total production, i.e. 722 ha)
- 184 samples of imported seed potatoes
- 51 samples of imported ware potatoes ([only] 37 were tested for ringrot)
- 122 samples taken from national cultivar testing trials
[Neither pathogen was detected in] domestic [or imported] ...
potatoes in 2001. The situation [for] both Cms ... and Rs ... in
Slovakia can be described as follows: Absent: confirmed by survey.

[Rs causes bacterial wilt in potato and other solanaceous crops and
weeds. The pathogen is very well adapted to survival in soil. There
are at least 3 races of Rs: race 1 infects a wide range of
solanaceous plants (e.g. bell pepper, egg plant, potato, and tomato);
race 2 infects banana; and race 3 infects primarily potato and a few
other hosts. The disease is difficult to manage although there are
resistant cultivars of tomato and egg plant. It is almost impossible
to rid a field infested with Rs. Planting resistant crops such as
cucurbits is a recommended option in such instances. According to
plant pathologists at the International Potato Center (CIP) in Peru,
control of bacterial wilt is very difficult because of its wide host
range, its survival in soil, and its biological variation. Management
of the disease depends on an integrated combination of control
measures. These include use of pathogen-free and/or -suppressive
soils, disease-free seed, short crop rotations, roguing of volunteer
plants, and resistance or tolerance. Chemical control is not possible
at present.
The Cms bacterium causes potato ring rot, one of the most serious
diseases of potato, which is spread by infected tubers and machinery.
Infected solanaceous weeds can be significant sources of inoculum. -
