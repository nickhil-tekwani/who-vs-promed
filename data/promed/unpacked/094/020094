A heifer from a farm in northern Minnesota's Beltrami County has tested
positive for bovine tuberculosis (TB), dealing a disappointing setback for
the state's cattle industry, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health said
today [25 Oct 2007]. The state has now detected bovine TB in 8 beef herds
in Roseau and Beltrami counties. While the infections pose little risk to
human health, the latest discovery slows the industry in its effort to
regain the crucial "TB-free" status, the board said.

The Beltrami County herd was quarantined last year [2006] after a TB
investigation revealed the owner had bought animals from a TB-infected
farm. The entire herd was tested at that time, and all animals tested
negative. But in a follow-up test this fall [2007], 2 animals tested
"suspect" for bovine TB. Tissue samples were submitted to the National
Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, and bovine TB was confirmed
in a 12 month old beef heifer Tuesday [23 Oct 2007]. The 2nd animal was
negative.

That herd numbered about 350. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is
working with the herd operator to have the animals put down and then
arrange compensation, the state board said.

The state's cattle herds will be declared free of TB only after 2 years
pass without a positive test. Losing the "TB-free" label poses a cumbersome
financial burden for ranchers, who must then pay for testing if they want
to sell their animals outside of the state.

This latest discovery means the industry must start over toward having 2
years of being TB-free. It had been about a year into achieving that status
before this positive test, said Board of Animal Health spokeswoman Malissa
Fritz.

The state's cattle herd health status took its initial hit in January 2006,
when the USDA said Minnesota cows were no longer considered free of
tuberculosis. That decision came after the discovery of 5 infected herds in
north western Minnesota.

In a statement issued today [25 Oct 2007], Dr Bill Hartmann, state
veterinarian and Board of Animal Health executive director said: "Finding
another positive herd will reset our time line for regaining status, but
for the sake of Minnesota's cattle industry, we cannot leave a single
infected herd undiscovered."

In addition to traces and area testing, the state is conducting TB testing
in cattle herds statewide. This statewide surveillance began before
discovery of this latest infected herd and is expected to be complete by
the end of the year [2007]. So far, the state has tested about 1200 herds,
and all have tested negative for bovine TB.

The disease is of little threat to consumers. The milk from an infected
animal would be rendered harmless by pasteurization, and infected meat
would be screened out of the food chain by visual inspections conducted at
the slaughterhouse, according to state officials.

[Minnesota has been trying to eliminate this disease from the state for
several years. The elimination process proceeds. Tuberculosis is caused by
the bacterium _Mycobacterium bovis_. Although this bacterium primarily
affects bovines, it can affect a wide range of mammals, including humans,
swine, and deer. - Mod.TG
