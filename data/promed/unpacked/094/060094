[Marion Wooldridge kindly forwarded the following message from Chris
Rodgers in Spain. - Mod.MHJ
EUS is quite a serious ulcerative disease of many (more than 100) species
of freshwater and estuarine fish. Some species, such as tilapia, chinese
carp and milk fish appear to be resistant though. It has been reported from
Japan, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand,
Vietnam, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, India, Bangladesh,
Nepal and Pakistan.
It is generally believed that a species of fungus (_Aphanomyces invadans_)
plays an important role in disease outbreaks, although bacteria (usually
_Aeromonas_ sp.) and a virus (Birnavirus or Rhabdovirus) may be secondary
complicating factors. Infected fish have dermal ulcerative lesions
throughout the body and skin damage is almost certainly a prerequisite for
disease manifestation. Typical early stages of the disease involve the
appearance of petechial haemorrhagic lesions on the skin, which later
develop into the deep ulcerative lesions. Mycotic granulomas spread
throughout the lesions and also in some of the internal organs.
Outbreaks occur at certain times of the year, normally after flooding
followed by cool weather. However, large cross-border movements of fish for
the aquaculture or ornamental trade are also implicated. Treatment is
difficult since the disease often occurs in large expanses of water or
rivers. However, agricultural lime applied at 150-600 kg per ha. at 2-4
week intervals can be effective. Application at 5 ppm may be useful as a
preventative measure.
EUS is not currently an OIE notifiable disease, although it does occur on
the list of "significant diseases".
