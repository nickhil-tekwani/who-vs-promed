Eight of 10 hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed neurologic complications and were 6 times more likely than their peers to die, according to early results from a global study published yesterday in JAMA Network Open.

Many of the conditions were mild to moderate, but half of the patients had altered brain function or structure, and almost 1 in 5 were in a coma.

Led by University of Pittsburgh researchers for the Global Consortium Study of Neurologic Dysfunction in COVID-19, the study involved 3744 hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients at 28 centers in 13 countries from March to October 2020.

Among the patients, 82% reported neurologic symptoms, with 37% having headaches and 26% saying they lost their sense of taste or smell. Clinicians determined that 49% of the patients had acute encephalopathy (diffuse disease that alters brain function or structure), while 17% were in a coma, and 6% had strokes.

The incidence of acute encephalopathy increased with age, from 33% in patients younger than 40 years to 74% in those older than 80. Meningitis and encephalitis (brain swelling and inflammation) were rarely observed (0.5%).

Lead study author Sherry Chou, MD, MSc, said in a University of Pittsburgh news release that acute encephalopathy is by far the most common neurologic issue she sees among COVID-19 patients. "Those patients may be in an altered sensory state or have impaired consciousness, or they don't feel like themselves and act confused, delirious or agitated," she said.

The proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation was 21% -- 39%, and in-hospital death rates ranged from 14% -- 25%.

The strongest predictor of COVID-19 neurologic complications was a preexisting neurologic condition of any kind--including dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and diseases of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves--which were associated with double the risk of coronavirus-related neurologic effects (adjusted odds ratio, 2.23). Likewise, any coronavirus-related neurologic symptoms, ranging from loss of smell to stroke, was tied to a 6-fold increase in the risk of death.

"This multicenter cohort study found that neurological manifestations in COVID-19 were highly prevalent and associated with premature mortality," the researchers wrote. "Using a global network with standardized protocols and common data elements is critical to facilitate further studies to understand COVID-19 neurological manifestations, including disease progression, associations with long-term outcomes, pathobiological mechanisms, and societal impact."

The researchers studied 3 different patient groups, including an "all COVID-19" group, which consisted of 3055 hospitalized coronavirus patients, regardless of neurologic status; a "neurological" group, which consisted of 475 patients with clinically verified neurologic symptoms; and the "ENERGY" (European Academy of Neurology COVID-19 registry) cohort, which included 214 patients evaluated by a consulting neurologist.

All 3 groups were made up mostly of older, White, overweight patients who had many underlying illnesses such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and previously diagnosed neurologic conditions. Patients who were older, male, or White, or had a high body mass index, were most likely to die.

Chou added that the long-term outlook for COVID-19 patients remains uncertain. "Even if the pandemic is completely eradicated, we are still talking about millions of survivors who need our help," she said. "It is important to find out what symptoms and health problems those patients are facing, and there is still plenty of work for years to come."

This study describes neurological manifestations in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across different cohorts and geographic regions. The next step will be to follow-up with these patients to evaluate them for long term effects, and to try to identify patients who had late onset of neurologic symptoms following infection, after having been released from the hospital. - Mod.LK]

[B] Grey matter
Date: Tue 11 May 2021
Source: Medical Express [abridged, edited]
https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-05-covid-gray-volume-brain.amp?__twitter_impression=true


COVID-19 patients who receive oxygen therapy or experience fever show reduced gray matter volume in the frontal-temporal network of the brain, according to a new study led by researchers at Georgia State University and the Georgia Institute of Technology.

The study found lower gray matter volume in this brain region was associated with a higher level of disability among COVID-19 patients, even 6 months after hospital discharge.

Gray matter is vital for processing information in the brain and gray matter abnormality may affect how well neurons function and communicate. The study, published in the May 2021 issue of Neurobiology of Stress, indicates gray matter in the frontal network could represent a core region for brain involvement in COVID-19, even beyond damage related to clinical manifestations of the disease, such as stroke.

The researchers, who are affiliated with the Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science (TReNDS), analyzed computed tomography scans in 120 neurological patients, including 58 with acute COVID-19 and 62 without COVID-19, matched for age, gender and disease. They used source-based morphometry analysis, which boosts the statistical power for studies with a moderate sample size.

"Science has shown that the brain's structure affects its function, and abnormal brain imaging has emerged as a major feature of COVID-19," said Kuaikuai Duan, the study's first author, a graduate research assistant at TReNDS and Ph.D. student in Georgia Tech's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. "Previous studies have examined how the brain is affected by COVID-19 using a univariate approach, but ours is the first to use a multivariate, data-driven approach to link these changes to specific COVID-19 characteristics (for example fever and lack of oxygen) and outcome (disability level)."

The analysis showed patients with higher levels of disability had lower gray matter volume in the superior, medial and middle frontal gyri at discharge and 6 months later, even when controlling for cerebrovascular diseases. Gray matter volume in this region was also significantly reduced in patients receiving oxygen therapy compared to patients not receiving oxygen therapy. Patients with fever had a significant reduction in gray matter volume in the inferior and middle temporal gyri and the fusiform gyrus compared to patients without fever. The results suggest COVID-19 may affect the frontal-temporal network through fever or lack of oxygen.

Reduced gray matter in the superior, medial and middle frontal gyri was also present in patients with agitation compared to patients without agitation. This implies that gray matter changes in the frontal region of the brain may underlie the mood disturbances commonly exhibited by COVID-19 patients.

"Neurological complications are increasingly documented for patients with COVID-19," said Vince Calhoun, senior author of the study and director of TReNDS. Calhoun is Distinguished University Professor of Psychology at Georgia State and holds appointments in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech and in neurology and psychiatry at Emory University. "A reduction of gray matter has also been shown to be present in other mood disorders such as schizophrenia and is likely related to the way that gray matter influences neuron function."

The study's findings demonstrate changes to the frontal-temporal network could be used as a biomarker to determine the likely prognosis of COVID-19 or evaluate treatment options for the disease. Next, the researchers hope to replicate the study on a larger sample size that includes many types of brain scans and different populations of COVID-19 patients.

The investigators concluded that "lower grey matter volume alterations in the identified frontal-temporal network can predict individual disability levels (i.e., mRS) at both discharge and 6 months follow-up for the hold-out testing samples, implying that the frontal-temporal network can be potentially employed as a biomarker for prognosis and evaluation of treatment of COVID-19." - Mod.LK]

[2] Vaccine: Pfizer
[A] CDC approval for adolescents
Date: Wed 12 May 2021

Today [Wed 12 May 2021] during a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) a group of independent experts voted 14-0 to recommend using Pfizer's 2-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in children ages 12 -- 15 years old.

This was the last green-light needed for the vaccine, which can now be administered to all people 12 and up, as soon as ACIP's formal recommendation is sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) later today [Wed 12 May 2021]. The move makes another 17 million Americans eligible for vaccination.

"This is another way to get closer to ending this horrible pandemic," said ACIP member Camille Kotton, MD, of Massachusetts General Hospital.

During the meeting, officials from the CDC also clarified that the vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines, paving the way for it to become part of the standard of care for US school-aged children.

Presented at the meeting were reassuring safety data and facts about the pandemic's effects on children: more than 22 million US children have contracted the virus, and 127 have died.

During a trial of the vaccine in 2260 young teens, only one serious side effect was reported, a fever higher than 104°F. A total of 20% of trial participants reported lower fevers, all resolving within 2 days of injection. Other side effects were mild and self-limiting, including pain at the injection site and fatigue.

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows 334 081 065 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered in the United States, and 263 132 561 doses have been administered, with 116 576 359, or roughly one 3rd, of Americans fully vaccinated. [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations]

In an address today, President Joe Biden urged all kids 12 and up to get vaccinated, and said beginning this week 15 000 pharmacies across the country will be able to vaccinate this age-group.

Biden also said he brokered a deal with Lyft and Uber to provide free rides to and from vaccine appointments through July [2021].

Also by the end of this week, 60% of Americans will have had at least one dose of vaccine, Biden said. He once again emphasized the goal of 70% of those eligible having at least one dose by [4 Jul 2021], in an attempt to celebrate America's independence from the virus.

Cases continue to drop in most areas with the United States reporting 33 651 new COVID-19 cases yesterday and 684 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases]

Daily case counts and deaths are returning to numbers not seen since early last summer. New daily US COVID-19 cases fell 21.1% in the past week, according to data from the Washington Post. New daily reported deaths fell 11.2%, and COVID-related hospitalizations fell 12.1%. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_pandemic%20test]

But while most of the country is seeing a drastic dip in cases as vaccinations go up, the Pacific Northwest is setting a late spring 4th wave, National Public Radio reports. [https://www.npr.org/2021/05/11/995795457/4th-wave-of-covid-19-hospitalizations-hits-washington-state]

In Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee has paused reopening as hospitals in Seattle have continued to fill--many with young adults.

States elsewhere are moving closer to removing all COVID-19 restrictions. In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster signed an executive order that allows parents to opt their children out of mask requirements in schools, effectively ending mask mandates for schools throughout the state, the New York Times reports. McMaster is the first governor to sign such an order. [https://www.npr.org/2021/05/11/995795457/4th-wave-of-covid-19-hospitalizations-hits-washington-state]. The order also banned the use of vaccine passports in the state.

"With the COVID-19 vaccine readily available and case numbers dropping, I will not allow local governments to use the state of emergency declaration as a reason for implementing or maintaining mask mandates," said McMaster in a statement. "Everybody knows what we need to do to stay safe--including wearing a mask if you're at risk of exposing others--but we must move past the time of governments dictating when and where South Carolinians are required to wear a mask."

[B] More on Pfizer vaccine and adolescents
Date: Wed 12 May 2021

The vaccine's cold-storage requirements and large lot size -- 1170 doses is the minimum order -- make it more challenging to be distributed immediately to doctors' offices. Biden said officials are mobilizing to find ways to equip doctors, including pediatricians, so they can give the shots to youths coming for checkups or other services. He described these efforts as enabling parents and children to consult the doctors they trust.

Vaccinating children is key to boosting the level of immunity in the population and reducing hospitalizations and deaths, experts say. As more adults are vaccinated, adolescents 12 to 17 years old are making up a greater proportion of infections, accounting for 9% of cases reported in April [2021], according to CDC data presented at the advisory panel's meeting.

"Older children can have severe disease from COVID-19 infection," said Kathy Poehling, a pediatrics professor at Wake Forest University and member of the advisory panel who described a teenager with COVID-19 who suffered a heart attack as a result of the disease. While deaths are uncommon in children, she and others noted that there were 127 adolescent COVID-19 deaths between 1 Jan and 30 Apr of this year [2021], which would have put the disease among the top 10 causes of deaths among children in 2019.

There are almost 17 million adolescents in the 12-to-15 age group in the United States, accounting for about 5.3% of the U.S. population, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

The only debate by the advisory panel revolved around whether the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should be given alongside other childhood or adolescent vaccines in the absence of data on how it might interact with them. That is an issue because routine immunizations have fallen sharply during the pandemic, with a decline of nearly 12 million doses as of [2 May 2021] compared with 2019, according to a CDC presentation.

The gap is largest in vaccines primarily given to adolescents, including the one targeting the human papillomavirus, known as HPV, and another to prevent tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis.

A CDC slide presentation at the meeting said that "substantial data" has been collected on the safety of coronavirus vaccines and also noted that "extensive experience" with other vaccines demonstrates their side effects and ability to generate an immune response are "generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously as when they are administered alone." [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-05-12/05-COVID-Woodworth-508.pdf]

For that reason, the presentation said that coronavirus vaccines and other vaccines "may now be administered without regard to timing," including giving them on the same day, as well as within 14 days.

But several panel members said they wanted more data, asking manufacturers to study how the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine might interact with other vaccines. Sarah Long, a pediatrics professor at Drexel University, said she was "not at all comfortable with deciding right now how these vaccines can be used concurrently with anything, without any data."

After the discussion, panel members agreed the vaccine could be given at the same time as other vaccines but asked that the CDC spell out more detailed instructions for providers that would take into account whether a patient is behind on recommended vaccines, or at risk of becoming so, and whether certain vaccines are more likely to produce side effects.

Yvonne Maldonado, a pediatrics professor at Stanford University and the panel's liaison from the American Academy of Pediatrics, said the pediatrics group would be issuing a statement to support the administration of multiple vaccines at the same time, "given the importance of routine vaccinations and the need for rapid uptake of COVID-19 vaccines."

Although adolescents are less likely than adults to be hospitalized or have severe illness because of coronavirus infection, there is no way to predict the few who will become critically ill or develop a rare, dangerous inflammatory syndrome. Out of more than 581 000 covid-19 deaths in the United States, only about 300 have been among those younger than 18. But that exceeds the number of children who die in a bad flu season.

Parents' eagerness to get their children vaccinated varies. A CDC presentation, citing 4 surveys, said about half of parents plan to get their children vaccinated.

A Kaiser Family Foundation survey found 3 in 10 parents of children ages 12 to 15 say they will get their children inoculated as soon as a vaccine is available; one-quarter say they will wait to see how the vaccine is working; 18% plan to get their children vaccinated if their schools require it; and nearly a quarter say they will definitely not have their children vaccinated. ...-more
