WHO official: bird flu control in Viet Nam improved
---------------------------------------------------
Bird flu control has improved, and so have government measures against bird
flu outbreaks, particularly in the health sector, said Dr Troesson Hans,
resident representative of the World Health Organization in Viet Nam. In an
interview with the Viet Nam News Agency on the eve of an Asia-Pacific
International Conference on Bird Flu, scheduled for 23 Feb 2005 in Ho Chi
Minh City, in which he will participate, the WHO official added, "other
very positive signs are the commitment and awareness within the government,
especially at the highest level." If long term measures are taken to
control animal infections, Viet Nam will stand a good chance of preventing
any further outbreaks, Hans said.
"In the short term, Viet Nam should manage outbreaks through continued
surveillance of poultry and humans, and contain animal infections. In the
long term, it should help change behavior in at-risk populations through
information, education and communication activities, increase the capacity
to respond rapidly, build integrated animal and public health surveillance
systems, improve laboratory capacities for analyzing and testing samples
bio-safely."
"Viet Nam and other Asian countries should make long-term investments to
control infections in animals throughout the chain, from poultry raising to
marketing and transportation right through to the household level,
implications of which would be major changes in husbandry practices. We are
providing technical and financial support [for] Viet Nam and other regional
countries, and coordinating with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) to mobilize additional donor resources," Hans said.

2nd int'l meeting on avian influenza opens in Ho Chi Minh City
--------------------------------------------------------------
Viet Nam has taken comprehensive measures to prevent and fight bird flu,
said Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Cao Duc Phat. At the 2nd
regional meeting on avian influenza control in animals which opened in Ho
Chi Minh City on 23 Feb 2005, Phat also said that the country's efforts had
contributed to regional countries' success in controlling the disease.
More than 150 delegates from 30 countries are attending the 3 day meeting,
jointly organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World
Organization for Animal Health and the World Health Organization.
They reviewed bird flu developments in the region and measures taken to
deal with the disease over the past 12 months. They also made scientific
presentations on achievements in discovering, inspecting, preventing and
controlling the disease. Issues relating to economy, international
cooperation and people's health were also mentioned at the meeting.
The meeting is an opportunity for regional countries to share experiences
in bird flu control and in protecting humans from the disease. Apart from
calling upon international organizations to support the fight against the
disease, the meeting will provide up-to-date information to help countries
strengthen their capacity for controlling avian influenza.
The Agriculture and Rural Development Ministry's Veterinary Department
reported that, by 21 Feb 2005, no new outbreaks have been found in 12 out
of 35 bird flu-affected provinces and cities in Viet Nam in the past 21
days. The provinces and cities free from the outbreak include Kien Giang,
Ninh Binh, Ha Nam, Binh Phuoc, Ninh Thuan, Lam Dong, Quang Binh, Thai
Nguyen, Nghe An, Dong Nai and Tien Giang provinces, and Ho Chi Minh City.

Fighting bird flu at its origin to prevent a human flu pandemic
---------------------------------------------------------------
Containing the bird flu virus to the greatest extent possible and reducing
the risk of infection in poultry and farmed free-range ducks will help to
prevent a global human influenza pandemic, the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) said today [23 Feb 2005].
"It is in the interest of both developed and developing countries to invest
in the control and containment of avian influenza. Our objective is to
protect human health -- locally and internationally -- and to promote food
security; our strategy is to control the disease at source," said Samuel
Jutzi, Director of FAO's Animal Production and Health Division. "This means
addressing the transmission of the virus where the disease occurs, in
poultry, specifically free-range chickens and wetland dwelling ducks, and
thus curbing the virus in the region before it spreads to other parts of
the world," Jutzi told the Regional Meeting on Avian Influenza in Ho Chi
Minh City during 23-25 Feb 2005.
"The disease could, in the worst case, lead to a new global human influenza
pandemic," Jutzi said. "There is an increasing risk of avian influenza
spread that no poultry keeping country can afford to ignore." Bird flu will
probably persist for many years in some of the countries that recently had
disease outbreaks, Jutzi said. Wild birds, particularly ducks, are
considered to be natural hosts of the bird flu virus, and it will,
therefore, be very difficult to completely eliminate the disease.
"However, current evidence suggests that trade in live poultry, mixing of
avian species on farms and at live bird markets, and poor biosecurity in
poultry production contribute much more to disease spread than wild bird
movements," Jutzi said. "FAO advises against the destruction of wild birds
and their habitats, as such practice is unlikely to contribute
significantly to disease control and is inappropriate from a wildlife
conservation viewpoint," he added.
Strict biosecurity measures need to be applied throughout the poultry
production chain, from farms and small producers to distribution channels,
markets and retailers. Public awareness of disease risks must be raised,
and some traditional practices, such as drinking the raw blood of ducks,
need to be changed to prevent further cases of human infection. He called
upon the international community to respond to the urgent requirements of
the Asian countries for support in their efforts "to get on top of this
current serious situation."
Countries need help to strengthen central animal health and veterinary
public health services; to implement stamping out, vaccination and
biosecurity programs; to develop better diagnostic methods and vaccines; to
support regional networks for information sharing, early warning and
control strategies.
FAO said that in addition to the human suffering, recent avian influenza
outbreaks have devastated many local economies. The major impact of the
epidemic has been on the livelihoods of rural communities depending on
poultry for their subsistence.
Close to 140 million birds have died or been destroyed in the Asian
epidemic to date, and loss of their flocks has left many farmers in deep
debt. Total poultry farm losses in Asia in 2004 are estimated at more than
USD 10 billion, according to Oxford Economic Forecasting.
The regional conference in Ho Chi Minh City was jointly organized by FAO
and the World Animal Health Organization [OIE], in collaboration with the
World Health Organization [WHO] and hosted by the government of Viet Nam.

[The current meeting should enhance massive and effective international
support to the affected countries in need in order to control this largest
and longest HPAI outbreak ever recorded. Unfortunately, the panzootic
begins to show signs of becoming endemic, affecting the region and beyond.
The impressive list of prominent experts and donors may give hope for
significant progress; let us wish them all a very successful meeting.
The 1st ("emergency") joint FAO/OIE Regional Meeting on Avian Influenza
control in Asia was held in Bangkok, Thailand (exactly) a year ago, from 26
to 28 Feb 2004. Extracts from its final report can be seen at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/press/Avian_bangkok_feb04_final_report_1.pdf>.
Among other issues, it included the following recommendations:
1. A regional avian influenza coordination group should be formed to
facilitate joint decision making, information sharing and training.
2. Member countries better fulfill their obligations for early and regular
disease and epidemiological information notification to the OIE.
3. There should be an agreed mechanism for the systematic collection and
epidemiologic analysis of all animal disease outbreak data, and
comprehensive molecular analysis of field virus strains. This should be
linked to public health surveillance systems.
4. The capacity of national animal and public health services for disease
surveillance, response, control and prevention activities should be
strengthened.
It seems that some recommendations still await, in certain affected
countries, full or better implementation; this includes the capacity
building as well as the reporting issue. No report on Viet Nam's avian
influenza situation has been sent to the OIE since 4 Jan 2005. - Mod.AS]
