To my knowledge there is no direct evidence that BSE derived from sheep
scrapie. The conjecture is that there was an increase in scrapie in sheep
in the UK and because of this the conclusion was drawn that it was sheep
that induced BSE. I am not convinced of this. I believe that spongiform
encephalopathy existed in cattle, albiet extremely rarely, and this then
led to a positive cow getting into the rendering process at a time when the
rendering process had stopped using organic solvents and was using lower
cooking temperatures. Further, I know of no evidence that transmissible
spongiform encephalopathy has been demonstrated in horses, turkeys,
kangaroos or any of the other species mentioned in your transmission.

[- Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies have, so far, been only
demonstrated in the following animal species ... mink, sheep, and cattle.
The other species were only suggested as future "maybe's" on the basis
that, when dead, they are recycled in animal feeds. They may have their
own prions like the others described to date, or not. - MH-J]

To the List Readers: It would seem to me that a reperable [reputable?]
scientist would publish his test methods and results if they are valid
since there has now been a lot of traffic concerning the urine test.
