Polio back in Yemen after 6 year absence
----------------------------------------
Polio has broken out in Yemen and may have been imported by pilgrims
returning from Mecca, international health officials said yesterday. The
disease appeared to have been on the verge of eradication in early 2004,
but has since spread to several countries across Africa and Saudi Arabia.
4 children paralyzed by polio have been found in Yemen, which is tucked
into a corner of the Arabian peninsula, and shares a long, porous border
with Saudi Arabia.
In response, the Yemeni government and the World Health Organization are
planning immunization drives for May and July 2005 in an effort to get
drops of oral polio vaccine into the mouths of all 5 million Yemeni children.
Last week, Yemen held its first such drive since 2001. The health minister,
Dr Yehya Mohammed al-Noami, said then that polio had not been seen in Yemen
since 1999 but that a surge of new cases in Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and
Ethiopia made precautions necessary.
Yesterday, a spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy in Washington said he knew
nothing about the new cases and referred a reporter to the government news
service Web site, which had no information about it posted.
WHO is struggling to find money to contain resurgent polio. 2 extra drives
in Yemen will cost over USD 2 million; at the same time, the agency's USD
25 million polio emergency fund has been depleted of all but USD 500 000
because of efforts in Sudan and Ethiopia, said Dr Bruce Aylward, the
agency's global polio eradication coordinator.
The Yemeni children found to have polio, aged 18 months to 7 years, are all
in the Red Sea port of Al Hudaida and first showed signs of paralysis in
February or early March [2005], said Dr Mohamed H Wahdan, WHO's Eastern
Mediterranean polio coordinator. In poor countries, it can take weeks to
confirm a polio case, because stool samples must be sent to distant
laboratories.
All of the children had been vaccinated, Dr Wahdan said, but apparently not
enough times. In countries with hot weather, open sewers and many other
intestinal viruses, it can take 6 to 8 doses of vaccine to produce the same
immunity that 3 or 4 do in cooler, cleaner countries.
Only about one case in 200 leads to paralysis, so there could be at least
800 more carriers in Yemen, and Dr Wahdan said he expected to find more
cases. [The ratio of paralytic cases to infected individuals ranges from a
high of 1 in 50 to a low of 1 in 1000 - Mod.MPP] He said virus samples had
been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta for
genotyping, which should reveal their origins.
In early February [2005], after 2 cases were found near Mecca, Dr Aylward
said he feared that some of the 2 million returning pilgrims could spread
the disease. "If I had to make a bet about where it would strike first,
Yemen would be it," he said yesterday. "But there's as much traffic into
Yemen from Sudan as there is from Saudi Arabia, so it's just as likely it
came from there."
Despite the small population and poverty of Yemen, Dr Wahdan said Yemen has
"lots of traffic." Many citizens work in wealthy Persian Gulf states, many
Sudanese teach in Yemeni schools, and African traders move through on their
way to the gulf.
A Saudi official said earlier this year that tens of thousands of people
enter his country illegally each month through Yemen. The bleak desert they
share is named the Empty Quarter and the border is officially undefined.
Sudan is having a major polio outbreak, particularly in Port Sudan, a Red
Sea ferry port.
All the migrating strains originated in Nigeria. 3 largely Muslim states in
northern Nigeria stopped vaccinating in 2003 after rumors spread that the
vaccine was a Western plot to sterilize Muslim women, that it transmitted
AIDS, and that it contained pork products.
They resumed vaccinations in mid-2004 after entreaties from top Muslim
clerics and after state officials visited foreign vaccine factories. But by
then new cases were turning up from the Atlantic to the Red Sea and as far
south as Botswana. "This is the low season for polio," Dr Aylward said, "so
we look for importation cases. These things come across borders like sparks
from a forest fire falling on dry tinder. Usually we're able to knock it
out quickly, like we did in Botswana last year, or in 2003 when we had an
import from India into Lebanon, or in 2001 when we had cases in Georgia and
Bulgaria. "But we've exhausted our emergency reserve. So the great news is
that cases are plummeting in Nigeria and Niger and India and Pakistan. But
our ability to respond to these sparks in dry tinder is way, way down.
We're really scrambling."

WHO position statement on 4 polio cases reported from Yemen
-----------------------------------------------------------
On 20 Apr [2005], 4 polio cases due to wild poliovirus type 1 were
confirmed in Yemen. The cases were reported from Hudeida governorate in
southwest Yemen, on the Red Sea coast. Prior to these cases, wild
poliovirus has not been found in Yemen since AFP surveillance began in 1996.
Situation
---------
On 4 April WHO Yemen was informed by Hudeida governorate health authorities
of a cluster of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in children, the 1st
cases of which had occurred in February 2005. The cases had been detected
through AFP surveillance activities and investigated, including collection
of stool specimens for laboratory investigation.
On 18 Apr [2005], in close coordination with local health authorities, 2
teams of WHO and Ministry of Health experts, including epidemiologists and
paediatricians, were dispatched to Hudeida governorate to further
investigate the cluster of AFP cases.
On 20 Apr [2005], results of testing of stool specimens of 4 of the cases
by the polio network laboratory in Oman revealed wild poliovirus type 1.
The laboratory and field investigation of other AFP cases is ongoing, and
additional information will be made public as soon as it is available,
including genetic information which will help identify the origin of the
wild poliovirus responsible for the cases.
WHO response
------------
Yemen has already conducted a nationwide immunization campaign on 13-15 Apr
[2005], to immunize all of the country's 4.5 million children under the age
of 5 years. WHO is working with the Ministry of Health in Yemen to plan for
further intensive house-to-house immunization activities in the immediate
geographic vicinity of the cases. Planning for the next nationwide
immunization campaign to be conducted in the 2nd half of May [2005] is
being intensified. Contingency plans for a potential 3rd campaign in June
[2005] are being discussed. Additional technical support is being provided
for the continuing investigation and for planning for immunization rounds.
WHO is working with the Ministry of Health in Yemen to ensure that AFP
surveillance throughout the country is sensitized so that no transmission
of wild poliovirus is missed. Additionally, Ministries of Health of
neighbouring countries have been informed.
Important note
--------------
The risk of importations into polio-free areas remains as long as polio
exists anywhere in the world. WHO urges all countries to maintain and
strengthen AFP surveillance and high population immunity.

[The occurrence of cases in Yemen is yet another setback in the global
effort to eradicate polio. Information on the most recent case counts
worldwide as of 19 Apr 2005 can be found at the polio eradication website
<http://www.polioeradication.org>. The cases in Yemen are not on the most
current table, as they were officially reported on 20 Apr 2005, the day
after the most recent update. It will be interesting to see the genetic
profile of the poliovirus involved to determine the origin of the virus,
although the likelihood of it being related to the ongoing outbreak in the
Sudan (which in turn was related to the ongoing outbreak in Nigeria) is
high. Whether these cases were related to travel through Mecca also awaits
to be seen. However, the identification of 4 cases strongly suggests that
whatever the original source of the virus, there is/was current ongoing
transmission in the involved area in Yemen. Credit goes to the Yemeni
Ministry of Health for conducting a national vaccination campaign while
results of the laboratory testing of the AFP cases were still pending. -
