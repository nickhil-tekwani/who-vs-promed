Two coyotes collected in the Valle del Oro area of western Potter
County of Texas have been found to be carrying antibodies to
_Yersinia pestis_, the plague bacillus. Blood samples from these
animals were tested as part of a surveillance program conducted in
conjunction with the Texas Wildlife Management Service. The
animals were collected within 300 yards of one another. The first
animal was collected in November 1998 while the second was
collected in late June 1999.
Coyotes serve as sentinel animals for plague. Two positive animals
from the same area indicates the possibility that there is active
plague in the Valle del Oro area, probably in the wild rodent
population of rats, mice, and ground squirrels, although rabbits and
hares may also carry the disease.
Plague is a reportable disease and all cases [in Texas should be
reported to the Texas Department of Health.
