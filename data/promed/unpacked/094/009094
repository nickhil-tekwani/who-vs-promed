New strains of wheat disease found in SA
----------------------
It is feared an early outbreak of a highly infectious wheat disease could
dramatically reduce South Australia's wheat yields. Stripe rust disease
has been detected in crops at Loxton and parts of the Yorke Peninsula.
Richard Saunders of the South Australian Research and Development Institute
says the earlier-than-usual outbreak is a concern because crops have not
yet reached a stage of resistance. He suggests it may be a new strain of
the fungus that is causing the disease.
Saunders said that there are 2 new strains of stripe rust in Australia, one
in western Australia and another in eastern Australia. The western strain
was very prolific in 2002 and is expected to eventually occur in South
Australia.

[Wheat stripe rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ f.sp.
_tritici_ (Ps). The fungus, also known as yellow rust or glume rust, is a
problem for grain farmers in cooler climates and at higher elevations in
Australia. The first outbreak of Ps in Western Australia in 2002 caused
crop losses ranging from 30-50 percent with greater losses (65 percent) in
some areas.
Disease control measures (chemical control) applied at early stages of
growth reduced crop damage considerably. A major concern is that the
western pathotype/strain could spread to eastern Australia where the
disease has been present since 1979. Partial and major resistance genes are
present in the eastern wheat cultivars, which should provide some degree of
disease protection. A popular cultivar, H45, which is susceptible to Ps and
blotch caused by _Septoria tritici_, is likely to be withdrawn in favor of
more resistant cultivars such as Bowerbird and Drysdale. - Mod.DH]
