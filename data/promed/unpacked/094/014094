H5N1 bird flu found at 5th site in Poland
-----------------------------------------
The deadly H5N1 bird flu virus has, according to this story, been
found in wild birds at a 5th site in Poland, officials said on
Wednesday [12 Dec 2007].

A stork and 2 buzzards, which died from the virus, were being kept at
a wild bird rehabilitation centre near the town of Orneta,
northeastern Poland, regional government veterinarian Ludwik
Bartoszewicz was quoted as saying on the TVN24 Web site.

Emergency services set up a safety perimeter around the site. The
rehabilitation centre is home to several other wild birds, including
cranes and swans. Since some of the species are endangered it was
unclear if culling would proceed as usual.

Bird flu hits one more Vietnamese province
------------------------------------------
Bird flu has recurred in Viet Nam's northern Bac Giang province,
raising the total number of localities currently affected by the disease to 2.

Bird flu virus strain H5N1 has killed over 1000 ducks in the 2
districts of Viet Yen and Yen Dung, local newspaper Saigon Liberation
on Wednesday [12 Dec 2007] quoted a report of the country's National
Anti-bird Flu Steering Committee.

Bird flu virus strain H7N3, currently hitting South Korea and Canada,
has not been found in Viet Nam yet, said Bui Quang Anh, head of the
Department of Animal Health under the Vietnamese Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development.

Viet Nam is focusing on intensifying disease surveillance, monitoring
of poultry raising, transport and trade, and vaccination among fowls
nationwide.

Bird flu outbreaks in Viet Nam, starting in December 2003, have
killed and led to the forced culling of dozens of millions of fowls
in the country, according to the department.

[3] China (Hong Kong SAR): H5N1 (Grey Heron)

Mai Po Nature Reserve to close 21 days
--------------------------------------
Mai Po Nature Reserve will close 21 days after a Grey Heron found in
Lok Ma Chau tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza, the
Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department says. The department
will monitor the situation and review the closure period.

The bird was found sick and was collected on 5 Dec 2007 at the
wetland compensation area of the MTR Lok Ma Chau Spurline. The bird
was kept in a cage and died the next day. There are no chicken farms
within 3 km [1.9 miles] of where the bird was found.

The department will remind poultry farmers, bird shop owners, licence
holders of pet poultry and racing pigeons to strengthen precautionary
and biosecurity measures. It will also conduct frequent inspections
of poultry farms and wholesale markets, and will continue wild bird
monitoring and surveillance.

The Food & Environmental Hygiene Department will continue to be
vigilant over imported live poultry as well as live poultry stalls
and will remind stall operators to maintain good hygiene. As the
threat of avian influenza remains, departments will remain vigilant
and take necessary preventive and control measures.

Avian flu outbreaks reported in 4 countries
-------------------------------------------
Poland, Russia, Viet Nam, and Saudi Arabia reported new outbreaks of
the deadly H5N1 avian influenza in birds today [12 Derc 2007],
according to news reports.

Poland has new outbreaks at 2 sites well separated from the 5
outbreaks reported recently in 2 areas northwest of Warsaw, according
to a Reuters report.

The disease cropped up at a small farm near Elblag, near the Gulf of
Gdansk in northeastern Poland, the story said. Ewa Lech, Poland's
chief veterinary officer, calling the site "an entirely new
location," said the farm has about 40 birds, according to the report.

Lech also confirmed a report that the virus was found in wild birds
near the town of Orneta, according to the story. A separate Reuters
story said the birds were a stork and 2 buzzards, all of which died.
Maps show that Orneta lies roughly 30 miles east of Elblag, and both
are approximately 100 miles from Plock.

Poland's recent series of outbreaks (its first in domestic birds)
began 30 Nov 2007 at 2 turkey farms near Plock, about 60 miles
northwest of Warsaw. On 8 and 10 Dec, the disease killed laying hens
on 2 large farms near Zuromin, according to Poland's 11 Dec 2007
report to the World organization for Animal Health (OIE). Zuromin is
about 50 km (31 miles) north of Plock, according to Reuters.

As of 19 Dec 2007, the OIE report said, 1181 birds had died of avian
flu in the Polish outbreaks and another 4258 had been destroyed. But
the affected farms had a total of about 510 000 birds that were at
risk and destined to be culled, the report said.

Meanwhile, a government official said today that an H5N1 outbreak on
a farm in southern Russia has killed more than 35 000 chickens over
the past 5 days, according to an Associated Press (AP) report from
Rostov-on-Don.

Sergei Kozhemyaka, Rostov regional emergency services officer, said
more than a half million remaining chickens on the farm would be
destroyed to stop the virus, said the story.

The previous H5N1 outbreak in Russia was at a poultry farm in
the Krasnodar region in September [2007], the story noted. The virus
also killed hundreds of domestic birds in the Moscow area in February [2007].

In Saudi Arabia, the agriculture ministry today announced an H5N1
outbreak at an egg production farm south of Riyadh, according to the
Kuwait News Agency. The ministry said the farm, in the Alsahba area
in Al-Kharj governorate, has about 400 000 hens.

Saudi Arabia has had a series of avian flu outbreaks in the Riyadh
vicinity that began 12 Nov 2007 according to previous reports.

In Viet Nam, which has battled many outbreaks this year, the virus
has recurred in the northern province of Bac Giang, according to a
Xinhua report published today (see item [3], above) The virus has
killed more than 1000 ducks in the Viet Yen and Yen Dung districts,
said the story, which cited the newspaper Saigon Liberation as its source.

Viet Nam's latest report to the OIE, filed 12 Nov 2007, says the
country had had 106 outbreaks for the year to that point, with 64 524
birds destroyed in control efforts.
