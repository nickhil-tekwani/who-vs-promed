Re: follow-up information on the northern Colorado meningococcal disease cases
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bacteria involved in the Larimer County outbreak are _Neisseria
meningitidis_, serogroup C, in the ST-11/ET-37 complex. PFGE [pulsed
field gel electrophoresis] testing done by the Colorado Department of
Public Health and Environment demonstrated that the 8 linked cases
(including the Denver Metro State student) were from the same clonal
group, and MLST [multilocus sequence typing] testing by CDC identified
the matching sequence types.

An additional case of meningococcal meningitis that occurred at the
same time as the hockey league outbreak (June 2010) did not grow out
_N. meningitidis_, but was identified by CDC (using PCR testing) as
meningococcal serogroup B. This case is believed to be unrelated to
the outbreak, although the possibility of capsule switching was
considered. Only one housekeeping gene was able to be amplified by CDC
in MLST testing, and this one gene sequence did not match the outbreak
strain.

There are epidemiologic links between the Metro State student and
other (non-ill) Colorado State University (CSU) students. Numerous
(non-ill) persons who play in the Fort Collins adult hockey league are
students or staff at CSU, including 4 people who played in the 9 Jun
2010 hockey game when 3 fatal cases appear to have become infected.
Other possible connections have been suggested for the 2 most recent
CSU student cases occurring in October and December 2010, but no
surveys of pharyngeal carriage of the outbreak strain have been done.

All hockey league players were offered antibiotic prophylaxis and free
meningococcal vaccine, as were all close contacts of the CSU student
cases.

After the fatal case in a CSU student in October 2010, a mass
vaccination effort was implemented on the CSU campus for students,
staff, faculty, (including household members) ages 2-29 who had not
received meningococcal vaccine in the past 3 years. Approximately 11
000 persons received free vaccinations in November and December 2010

Concerns about waning immunity occurring in persons vaccinated with
meningococcal conjugate vaccine have been discussed at recent meetings
of CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). They
have also identified [the problem] that immune memory cells may not be
able to mount a response as rapidly as meningococcal bacteria can
cause severe or fatal illness.

Based on information presented at the 27 Oct 2010 ACIP meeting
(<http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/acip/downloads/mtg-slides-oct10/02-5-mening-mcv4.pdf>), consultation with the state and CDC, and the high case-fatality observed in this outbreak (5 of 7 cases [71 percent] at the time; now 5 of 8 [62 percent]), the "greater than 3-year period since immunization" was selected for this vaccination campaign -- an even shorter time frame than the 5-year booster recently recommended by ACIP in October
2010.

Although 6 of the northern Colorado outbreak cases had not been
vaccinated for meningococcal disease, the 2 most recent cases in CSU
students -- one of which was fatal -- had both received meningococcal
conjugate vaccine in 2006.

[As Dr LeBailly notes, it is concerning that the 2 most recent cases
in CSU students, one of which was fatal, both received meningococcal
conjugate vaccine in 2006. Data (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/acip/downloads/mtg-slides-oct10/02-5-mening-mcv4.pdf>) indicate protection wanes within 5 years after vaccination. In addition, invasive disease develops so rapidly, immune memory cells may not be able to mount a response in sufficient time to control the
infection.
