----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bacterial leaf streak of corn, caused by _Xanthomonas vasicola_ pv. _vasculorum_, was recently reported in the US [ProMED-mail post 20160906.4467551] and Argentina [and] has reached epidemic levels in some US states. In April 2018, diseased corn in the state of Parana [Brazil] [showed] leaves with translucent yellow to brown interveinal lines with irregular margins. Older symptoms on highly susceptible corn hybrids were coalescing long lesions of dark color, reaching large extension along the leaf blade. Preliminary examinations revealed the presence of bacterial ooze.

Pathogenicity of the bacterial isolates was confirmed on the _Zea mays_ hybrid JM 2M77. Lesions similar to those in the corn fields started to show up 9 days after inoculation. We reisolated consistently from the affected leaf tissues bacteria identical to those originally inoculated.

Based on the analysis of PCR amplified sequences of the 16S rDNA region, the bacterial isolates showed genetic similarity of 99% with _X. vasicola_ pv. _vasculorum_ strain SAM119 isolated from corn in South Africa, the pathotype strain of the pathovar. Further, a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree confirmed that our bacterial strains clustered with Xvv strain SAM119.

The disease was present in commercial fields in at least eight municipalities of Parana. In addition, bacterial leaf streak of corn was detected under natural conditions on _Z. mays_ plants of at least 30 different commercial hybrids. Although the occurrence of _X. vasicola_ pv. _vasculorum_ causing bacterial leaf streak of corn has been suspected in Brazil in previous years, this is the first confirmed report.

[_Xanthomonas vasicola_ (previously _campestris_) pv. _vasculorum_ (Xvv) has primarily been reported as a pathogen of sugarcane to cause gumming disease. Gumming is considered one of the most serious diseases of this crop in many countries and was one of the 1st plant diseases proven to be of bacterial aetiology. Xvv leaf streak on maize was previously only known from South Africa, where it has been associated with inoculum from crop residue, overhead irrigation and warm temperatures, but impacts on yield were often minimal. Molecular analysis, including sequencing, has shown a difference in sugarcane and maize infecting strains of Xvv (see links below). A number of graminaceous species, including oats, rice, pasture, and weedy grasses, were found to be able to serve as reservoir hosts for Xvv infection of maize (see ProMED-mail post 20180121.5574770). It is not clear if maize infecting strains have emerged naturally, or if intensified agricultural systems may have favoured their evolution.

_Xanthomonas_ pathogens cause a range of important crop diseases, including bacterial blight of banana and rice, citrus canker and black rot of brassica vegetables (see previous ProMED-posts in the archives). They can survive between seasons on volunteer crop plants or plant debris. They can be seed borne, depending on the host, and can be spread with infected plant and other materials, by water and mechanical means (including human and insect activity). Disease management is difficult and may include phytosanitation (control of reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated materials), cultural measures (optimal plant spacing and fertilisers), bacteriocides (such as copper compounds), and use of resistant crop varieties. Genome sequencing of species and pathovars of _Xanthomonas_ is providing information on mechanisms of bacterial virulence.
