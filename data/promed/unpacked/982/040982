GLANDERS, EQUINE - SYRIA: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

[In May 2010, Bahrain notified the OIE about an outbreak of glanders
in local horses which was attributed to the introduction, 6 months
earlier, of (subclinically) infected horses from Syria and Kuwait (see
archived 20100510.1527). Recently, an outbreak of glanders in Lebanon
was attributed by a cited respectable source (the director of the
Society for the Protection and Improvement of the Arabian Horse in
Lebanon) to the earlier introduction of infected horses from a breeder
in Damascus, Syria (see archived 20110730.2295).

The following relevant publications are brought to the attention of
subscribers, underlining the need for updated information on the
actual glanders situation in Syria. - Mod.AS]

Introduction (pages 3-4 out of 53)
----------------------------------
Glanders is a disease of equidae which has been eradicated from most
countries in the world. However, it is a re-emerging disease and still
exists in parts of Asia and South America, and odd cases are reported
from time to time in other countries.

No cases have been recorded in the Middle East for many years. The
last cases reported in this region were in Turkey in 1998 (OIE, annual
report). The Turkish Veterinary Authorities carried out large scale
testing of equidae in 2000/2001 using CFT and mallein tests. Positive
animals were destroyed, and no cases have been reported since.

In 2004 a Glanders outbreak occurred in horses in the UAE in
post-import facilities. The disease was reported to the OIE.

In 2009, 10 new outbreaks occurred in Bahrain and Kuwait. The source
of all 3 outbreaks has not yet been determined, but it is thought to
be Syria.

Re-occurrence of glanders has also been reported from Brazil and
Pakistan.

In the Middle-East the incidence of glanders, an infectious disease
that mainly affects horses and poses a serious health risk to animals
and even humans must be increasingly monitored by official national
Veterinary services in the region, concluded a high-level OIE expert
mission that visited, respectively Syria, Kuwait and Bahrain, (2-8 Oct
2010). The investigation found that sometimes weak early detection and
laboratory diagnosis capacity, combined with under-reporting of the
disease, facilitated spread of glanders in the region.

"Glanders is a re-emerging disease against which many countries in the
Middle East are not armed. The OIE stands for strengthening national
Veterinary Services and urges the concerned governments to rely on
them in the fight against the disease," Dr Vallat, OIE Director
General, said. "We particularly appreciated Bahrain's transparency in
quickly notifying the presence of the disease to the OIE earlier this
year [2010, the year of the OIE mission], and we are confident that
the country's huge surveillance efforts will lead to a very quick
restoration of its freedom disease status, once the last
investigations currently in progress in a small part of the country
are completed," he added.

The OIE mission indicated that disease investigations carried out by
private veterinarians independently often prevented official
veterinary authorities from monitoring the circulation of the disease
in the region, thus preventing timely and appropriate action.

The mission recommended that the preliminary disease surveillance
programme carried out in Syria be strengthened through the procedures
proposed by the OIE reference laboratory of Jena, Germany [see
comment]. The same recommendation was formulated for Kuwait, which for
its part committed to continue notifying the presence of the disease
(Kuwait had already done so within the framework of the OIE mission
for the confirmed cases in 2009 and is expected to provide soon an
update for 2010) and to develop an exhaustive programme for the
identification of the entire horse population of the country.

"My colleagues from the OIE reference laboratory in Jena and myself
were very well received in the field," Dr Ben Jebara, team leader of
the mission, commented. "The data we gathered thanks to the open
collaboration of all stakeholders in the countries visited is of
utmost importance to assess the situation of the presence of glanders
in the entire region," he added. Answers to the questionnaire sent by
the OIE prior to the mission were prepared in all transparency by
visited countries. Further missions may follow in other parts of the
region based on country requests.

The OIE will convene an international technical conference on glanders
that will raise awareness of OIE delegates of the disease and the need
for appropriate surveillance mechanisms to be in place on their
territories. The conference shall be an opportunity for the OIE to
assess the needs of members, including a mechanism for their official
recognition of the disease status of glanders by the OIE.

Background information

With only sporadic reporting of the disease worldwide in the 50 years
following the 2nd World War, glanders was believed to have disappeared
until it burst out again in the late 1990's in different regions of
the world.

[Results of the "preliminary disease surveillance programme carried
out in Syria" will be much appreciated, as well as details on the
"procedures" (for the said surveillance) "proposed by the OIE
reference laboratory of Jena, Germany."

We shall also be grateful for obtaining, and glad to publish,
available details on the envisaged "international technical conference
on glanders," its agenda and proceedings. - Mod.AS]
