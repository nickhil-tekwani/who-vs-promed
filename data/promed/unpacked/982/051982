A front page headline entitled "Flesh Eater on the Move" appeared in the
Sunday Herald-Sun newspaper in Melbourne, Australia on 8/11/98. There was a
full-page follow-up article on page 3 headed "Flesh-eater spreads". The
articles referred to recent cases of _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ (MU)
infection in the Australian state of Victoria, and included interviews with
2 patients and a photograph of one patient's scarred shoulder.
The article has aroused considerable concern among members of the public
across the state. It is good to warn people so that they remember to seek
medical attention early. However, in my opinion, the rarity of the disease
in this part of the world did not justify the prominence given to it by the
reporters and sub editors. However, there is a major epidemic of MU
infection occurring in West Africa. The comments below refer only to the
situation in Victoria:
1. Australia has one of the lowest rates of TB in the world. MU infections
are about 100 times LESS common than TB in Australia (estimated Australian
incidence of MU infection: 0.05/100,000 per year).
2. MU is related to TB and leprosy because it is a mycobacterial pathogen,
NOT because it is transmissible from person to person. MU is an
environmental pathogen.
3. There have been FEWER cases than normal this year in Victoria (only 2 or
3 to my knowledge; the population of the State is around 4.5 million).
4. If diagnosed early, treatment by simple surgical resection has a high
success rate with minimal scarring.
5. MU infection is transmitted by an unknown means from the local
environment to individuals. New endemic areas are appearing in the greater
Melbourne region for unknown reasons, but there are still just a handful of
cases. We are conducting active research into the ecology of MU with
funding from the Victorian Government Department of Human Services.
6. There is no proven way of avoiding MU infection, except to keep away
from endemic areas. However, the risk is so low that in my opinion there
is no reason that anyone should avoid any of the several places mentioned
in the newspaper article.
7. The same common sense precautions that help prevent mosquito bites and
sunburn are also likely to prevent MU infection. Cleaning and covering
scratches sustained out of doors may also help.
8. The disease moves slowly (days to weeks, NOT minutes to hours). MU
infeciton is NOT the same as Group A Streptococcal necrotising fasciitis.
9. If clinicians are concerned about a patient with an unusual skin lesion,
the diagnosis can be made reasonably easily by combinations of AFB smear
and PCR (from skin swabs). Histological examination of punch biopsy is
also quick and very helpful, and should be done if there is any doubt.
Culture takes a long time, it is best to start treatment before waiting for
the result, but should always be done to confirm the diagnosis.
