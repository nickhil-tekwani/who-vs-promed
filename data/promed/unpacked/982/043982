The cool and showery conditions seen in Lincolnshire during April
[2008] have encouraged the development of _Septoria tritici_ in all
wheat varieties with obvious visible infection on final leaf 6, with
some symptoms on leaf 5. Development of this disease will have been
checked to some extent by the cool temperatures.

To date, brown rust has shown few signs of appearing, while a series
of recent frosts has continued to suppress mildew.

Meanwhile, Robigus [variety] was displaying yellow rust at a cereals
[experimental] site in early April [2008], albeit later than some
commercial crops in the area which saw yellow rust develop during March [2008].

Eyespot, or general stem-based browning symptoms, is present in many
commercial crops and the ongoing development of eyespot is of concern
if current weather patterns continue.

Few other diseases have featured so far [in wheat crops]. Disease
levels in winter barley and winter oats remain low. There is some
physiological spotting present in winter barley, most noticeably in
the variety Flagon.

Winter wheat -- yellow rust is sporulating actively on untreated
Robigus in the east. New lesions of _Septoria tritici_ are developing
on leaf 3 of more susceptible varieties. Brown rust remains at low
levels in Alchemy and other susceptible varieties and is mainly on leaf 3.

Eyespot is being reported very widely in wheats. There are some very
severe lesions causing damage to the lowest green leaves on some
tillers. Fusarium is causing browning of leaf sheaths and some sharp
eyespot is present.

On the Wiltshire/ Dorset border, Dan Dines said the 1st T1 sprays had
gone on. "Septoria is the main disease threat in wheat. Both yellow
and brown rust are notable by their absence thus far. Eyespot is
present in some fields, and mildew can be found in a small number of
crops. Fungicide treatments should be based on diseases present/disease risk."

Lincolnshire-based Ruth East said crop growth had also been slowed
due to cold weather, but there was plenty of disease about that would
need treating. "_Septoria tritici_ is abundant on the lower leaves of
susceptible varieties, a well timed, robust T1 [fungicide] will be
needed to control it, because if temperatures increase the disease
will take off."

But further north in Northumberland, frustration was growing as
showery weather continued to disrupt planned spraying programmes.
Robert Sullivan said, "Disease levels in general are low in the
crops, with septoria being really the only disease apparent, although
there are signs of eyespot on some crops."

During my tour around the country [Ireland] last week [14-20 Apr
2008], what struck me was a general lack of septoria lesions on the
upper leaves of wheat. The only wheat variety, which has plenty of
disease was Consort. However, don't be fooled into thinking that
there is no disease in cleaner varieties, as normally there is plenty
of septoria at the base of the crop just waiting for its chance to
spread upwards.

Mildew was absent and I failed to spot a crop with any level of the
disease. However, I did spot eyespot on my travels and, if it is
present on a crop, then it should be addressed with the T1 fungicide.
There are many fungicide options available at T1 that can be used
effectively and represent value for money.

Wheats in a rotational position that are susceptible to Take-all (2nd
wheats after a break crop, or 3rd wheats after ley) may require attention now.

[Cereal diseases of the septoria complex are appearing in both the UK
and Ireland. They can be caused by the fungi _Mycosphaerella
graminicola_ (previously _Septoria tritici_) and _Phaeosphaeria
nodorum_. These pathogens cause blotches on both leaves and glumes.

Eyespot (also called strawbreaker) caused by the fungus _Oculimacula
yallundae_ is also being reported from both the UK and Ireland. Sharp
eyespot caused by the soil-borne fungus _Ceratobasidium cereale_
appears to be emerging in the UK only.

Take-all is reported to appear in Ireland. It is a fungal disease
causing severe yield loss of up to 50 percent in cereal crops.
_Gaeumannomyces graminis_ var. _tritici_ causes the disease in wheat
and barley; other pathovars affect different cereal and grass hosts.

Several fungal species originally classed into the genus _Fusarium_
can cause blight diseases on cereals. They are still commonly
referred to as fusarium although some of the pathogens have since
been re-assigned to different genera. Leaf rust, also called brown
rust, on wheat is caused by the fungus _Puccinia recondita_, and
stripe (yellow) rust is caused by _P. striiformis_ var.
_striiformis_. Both these rusts affect leaves reducing the
photosynthetic potential of the plant. Powdery mildew of wheat is
caused by _Blumeria graminis_ and affects all aerial parts of the host.

For further information on the diseases mentioned please see links
and previous ProMED-mail posts listed below.

Cereal disease management can be applied at key decision times (T0,
T1, T2, and T3) to reflect the changing risk as the season unfolds. T
reflects the growth stages referring to tillers present at a
particular time: T0 refers to the coleoptile tiller, T1 to the tiller
developing from the 1st leaf, etc. Continuous monitoring, as
reflected in the reports above, and early discovery of infection at
any stage of the crop cycle is important so action can be taken to
limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum.
