Medical personnel in Baringo and Elgeyo-Marakwet counties have been
put on high alert after 9 out of 16 of people tested for yellow fever
[YF virus infection] turned out positive. The area had been put on
high alert last week after a 50-year-old man succumbed to a disease
suspected to be yellow fever in Kapluk area of North Baringo district,
bringing to 6 the number of people who have succumbed to the disease
since the beginning of the year. This prompted Kenya Medical Research
Institute (KEMRI) officials from Kisumu and Busia to be deployed to
the area to monitor the situation.

According to Baringo north district Medical Officer of Health (MOH)
Dr Felix Atisa, blood specimens for the victims from Kapluk Dispensary
and Kabarnet District Hospital taken for analysis at KEMRI
headquarters in Nairobi on Tuesday last week [26 Apr 2011] revealed
that they have the viral disease. Dr Atisa said that health personnel
in all health facilities in the area have been directed to be on the
lookout for the symptoms of the disease, which include chills, fever,
headache, backache, joint and muscle pains and yellowness of the eyes
in severe cases, which become noticeable within a period of 3-6 days
after the victim is bitten by the mosquito. The medic, however,
assured the locals that all health facilities in the area have been
stocked with enough drugs in case of any emergency.

He advised the residents to ensure that bushes and empty cans around
their compounds were cleared since they were conducive environments
for the breeding of mosquitoes. "We advise the people to take
precautionary measures to prevent mosquitoes breeding in their
compounds and also spraying insecticides. We also urge those who
develop any symptoms similar to those of yellow fever to seek
medication without delay," said Dr Atisa.

He said that health personnel have also been deployed to the high
risk areas to carry sensitization campaigns to the people. He said
that a mass vaccination of the entire population will soon be rolled
out in the area. The last time the exercise was carried out in Baringo
and Elgeyo Marakwet counties was in 2001. This was after 15 people
died of the disease, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to
intervene.

A senior health official who preferred anonymity warned that more
people will succumb to the deadly disease if no urgent measures are
taken by the government to roll out a mass vaccination exercise.
"Yellow fever vaccines provide immunity for a period of 10 years,
which have elapsed since the last vaccination in the area. To make the
matters worse, the area has not been mapped out to determine the
extend of the fatal disease," said the medic.

Local residents who spoke to the Nation claimed that many people from
areas such as Salawa, Kapluk, Barwessa and Seretunin were beginning to
develop the symptoms of the disease. Led by Mr Harold Kipchumba of
Bare Carea local CBO, the residents demanded that results from KEMRI
be made public by the government.

"Even if the economic impact of such a step is big, the life of our
people should come 1st," said Mr Kipchumba. He feared that the
situation will worsen with the expected downpour in the area. Baringo
and Elgeyo Marakwet counties, particularly the lower regions, are
prone to yellow fever.

Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by
infected mosquitoes and can be transmitted from one person to another
by the mosquito that bites during the day. The "yellow" in the name
refers to the jaundice that affects some patients. According to the
World Health Organisation (WHO), there is no cure for yellow fever.
Treatment aims at reducing the symptoms for the comfort of the
patient. Vaccination is the most important preventive measure against
the disease.

[This situation is confusing in that the case of the 50-year-old man
from the Baringo district who was originally suspected as having YF
was subsequently discarded as a YF case after laboratory tests done at
KEMRI were negative. Is the above case the same one, as seems likely?
In any event, since 9 of 16 suspected YF cases have turned out to be
positive (by tests done at KEMRI?), there is a small YF outbreak going
on in the area and rapid implementation of a vaccination program is
needed urgently. ProMED would appreciate receiving additional field
and laboratory information as it becomes available.
