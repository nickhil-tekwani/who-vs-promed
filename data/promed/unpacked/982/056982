Dozens of people with suspected typhoid have been hospitalized in the
southern Kyrgyz province of Batken, a health official told IRIN on Tue 13
Jul 2004. The official cited a lack of safe potable water as the root cause
of the outbreak.
"As of Tue 13 Jul 2004, 124 people have been hospitalized in Batken
province with suspected typhoid. In 64 cases, the diagnosis has been
confirmed," Inna Chernova, senior epidemiologist at the epidemiological
department, reported from the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek.
According to the Kyrgyz Health Ministry, the 1st cases were detected in
late May 2004 and in early June 2004, while in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th weeks
of June 2004, higher numbers were reported, with up to 15 people being
admitted to health facilities each week.
Of the 64 confirmed cases, 51 were from Kyzylbel village, not far from the
provincial capital, Batken, and 12 were from Batken town itself.
But, the number of cases began to slow recently. "The intensity of the
outbreak is now diminishing, with only a few patients, 2 or 3, being
detected a week," Chernova said.
In the 1st 6 months of 2003, there were 8 cases of typhoid in the area,
while some 70 cases were registered in the 2nd half of the same year.
The health official cited contaminated water as the main cause of the
problem. Local people were working in the fields using water from
irrigation ditches contaminated by Batken town's sewage, and some
apparently drank it, she explained.
"There is a severe lack of safe drinking water in the area. The piped water
system is not good either, working for only 2 to 3 hours a day," the
epidemiologist noted.
The annual global occurrence of typhoid fever is estimated at 17 million
cases, with about 600 000 deaths. Some strains of the typhoid bacillus are
resistant to antibiotics.
