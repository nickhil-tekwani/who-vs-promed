Opening for a Copy Editor
-------------------------
The International Society for Infectious Diseases (ISID) [https://isid.org] has an immediate opening for an hourly Copy Editor for its Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) [https://promedmail.org]. This Copy Editor will join an existing team of 4 other Copy Editors and will cover the following shifts (all times are EDT):

Thursdays: 4:00 - 9:00 pm
Fridays: 6:00 - 9:00 pm
Saturdays: 4:00 - 9:00 pm
Sundays: 9:00 am - 3:00 pm

Background
ProMED is made up of over 50 subject matter experts (called "Moderators") around the world who are on the lookout for the next emerging or re-emerging infectious disease outbreak. The 50 Moderators work across the 10 different ProMED networks that focus on different geographies and/or languages. The Moderators write reports that are then sent to the Copy Editor on duty for editing and publication.

Duties
Copy Editors receive reports written and formatted by Moderators with specialties in epidemiology, virology, bacteriology, animal and plant health, etc. The Copy Editor on duty reviews and edits the report format, corrects/adds archive metadata, checks facts and URLs, and edits the report for final publication on the ProMED website [https://promedmail.org] and to be sent via email to a large list of subscribers. All work is done via an online dashboard.

The Copy Editor team is a cohesive team that regularly collaborates in a remote work setting. While the schedule above is the standard schedule for this role, flexibility and the willingness to cover additional shifts for colleagues when needed are crucial, as is the ability and willingness to adjust to any future schedule changes.

Requirements
- Knowledge of human, animal, and plant pathology is highly desirable.
- Copy-editing experience.
- Proficiency in written English.
- Proficiency in languages other than English is a plus.
- Proficiency in Internet and social media.
- Strict attention to detail.
