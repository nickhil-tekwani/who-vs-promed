FMD Report: 72 000 suspected cases, 15 000 deaths
-----------------------------------------------------
According to confirmed reports from the departments of veterinary medicine in the various governorates, there seems to be a decline in the daily incidence of FMD; from thousands of new cases per day, they are now counted in the hundreds.

The report, received by Engineer Mohammad Reza Ismail, Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation, from the General Organisation for Veterinary Services [GOVS], states that [the most recent infected governorates] are North Sinai (one case) and the Red Sea (71 cases). No cases have been reported from South Sinai.

According to Dr. Suhair Abdel Kader, Head of the Central Department for Preventive Medicine, the cause for the continued emergence of new cases per day is due to non-compliance, by the breeders and owners, with the requirements banning the movement of animals between farms and provinces and other bio-security measures, These include the need to separate sick animals from healthy ones as well as separating suckling calves from their dams.

According to the report, the total number of suspected cases, since the onset of FMD on 26 February 2012, is 72 272 of which 14 948 died - predominantly baby calves. Mortality in older animals is much lower, namely 2 - 3 percent.

The report emphasized that about 75 percent of the cases, namely 54 173, have recovered. There are 1569 veterinary units, scattered all over the country, which are engaged in the clinical treatment of the remaining 18 108 recovering animals. There are ongoing efforts by the MinAg and GOVS to monitor the health of animals and restrict contacts between foci of FMD.

The highest numbers of suspected cases have been recorded in the governorates of Gharbia and Dakahlia, with - respectively - 25 895 cases (3973 deaths) and 10 389 (1912 deaths) reported. Gharbia [=West] includes the largest concentration of dairy farms in Egypt. The figures of sick and dead animals from other governorates were the following: Alexandria 2400 (229), Minya 1973 (434), Suez 5306 (343), Qalyubia 1294 (244), Buhayrah 4382 (1141), Giza 2635 (146), Damietta 3018 (1057) , Menoufia 1905 (1081), Beni Suef 1679 (666), Kafr El-Sheikh 1696 (1313), Qena 1378 (222), Sohag 1495 (361), Assiut 1513 (250), Port Said 540 (202), Cairo 1272 (35), Sharqiah 492 (61) deaths, Ismailia 603 (28), Marsa Matrouh 110 (15), Al Wadi Al Jadid (New Valley) 247 (40), Fayoum 776 (55), Aswan 251 (67), Northern Sinai 1 (recovered).

Guidance is being provided to animal holders/breeders by the regional veterinary units regarding sanitary measures to be applied, including cleansing of premises, treatment of cadavers and other measures to be applied in order to eradicate the disease. -Mod. AS].

[According to several Egyptian newspapers of Sun 8 Apr 2012, new FMD cases and mortalities are continuing in several governorates, such as Menoufia, Kafr EL-sheikh and Qena. It may be assumed that the accurate accumulated number of infected/sick animals is higher than reported; mortality figures are easier to collect, their accuracy may well be higher. Cases in small ruminants are not included, probably because they are less likely to be clinically detected.

Clinical treatment of sick animals by visiting veterinarians is generally a step deserving caution; however, within heavily infected regions, the potential spread of the virus by mobile visitors is probably a less significant cause for concern. - Mod.AS].

Abu Naga: "11 million pounds in support of urgent purchase of 2 million doses FMD vaccine"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fayza Abul Naga, Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, has announced the allocation of EGP 11 million [USD 1 822 700] in support of urgent purchase, by the General Organisation for Veterinary Services, of 2 million doses of vaccine against Foot and mouth disease [FMD] strain Sat2.

Abul-Naga said in a news release Sunday [8 Apr 2012], that the Ministry of International Cooperation is currently studying ways to provide an additional amount to finance the purchase of vehicles equipped to work on the rapid diagnosis of disease epidemiology, a complement to the urgent efforts taken by the Egyptian government to face this disease.

She stressed that the Egyptian government is seeking to combat FMD in the various provinces of Egypt; the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation, Egypt is making efforts to curb the spread of the disease and contain it.

Despite government efforts against foot-and-mouth, meat still off the table in the Delta
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meat markets in the busy Galaa Street of Shebin al-Kom, the capital city of Monufiya Governorate, remain empty, in contradiction to recent government reports that the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] is under control there and in several other governorates.

Although this governorate is one of the few regions in Egypt where residents say they have managed to curb the outbreak of the virus, the scare around the outbreak means meat is no longer a welcome food on Monufiya residents’ plates.

Dr. Salah Kabeel, director of the Veterinary Medicine Directorate in Monufiya, told Egypt Independent that the number of infections has dropped greatly in this Delta governorate.

Kabeel said the progress was a result of a widespread immunization plan implemented by the government.

Kabeel stressed that immunizations throughout the governorate are being administered according to a tight schedule.

“The directorate has formed committees to follow up on all the villages and centers and to conduct outreach programs to educate farmers about the seriousness of the disease,” Kabeel said.

Kabeel said in recent days there have only been 5 to 9 new cases reported in the governorate, compared to the daily 30 to 40 cases of the last 2 weeks. He said 1785 cases have been cured and 203 are currently being treated.

In this governorate, which is known for growing cotton and being the birthplace of the 2 most recent Egyptian presidents­ Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak,­ meat markets showed a severe 70 percent drop in meat sales.

The rapid spread of FMD among cows and sheep has deterred consumers from buying meat and pushed them toward poultry and fish, causing a hike in prices of the alternative protein options. And though the outbreak might be subsiding, it’s unclear how long customers will fear to put meat back on the table.

Mina Talaat, a 67-year-old retired officer, said he has grown used to yearly outbreaks of disease, recalling the spread of bird flu about 5 years ago, then followed by swine flu and now the FMD virus.

"For years, the poultry sector in Egypt has suffered from the H5N1 bird flu epidemic, so it is its turn now to be revived a little bit," Talaat joked wryly.

However, Nafaa Ayad, a live poultry trader, said he had not seen any remarkable increase in prices or demand. He attributed a slight rise in demand to customers just now starting to buy poultry again after the economy slump that followed the country’s uprising last year.

"The whole market after the revolution is very slow ­ people renounced buying meat and chicken for quite some time now," Ayad told Egypt Independent. "This slight rise can’t be blamed on the increase demand for poultry after the spread of the disease."

Monufiya and other agriculture heavy areas of the Lower Nile Delta were among those most severely affected by the virus, according to a statement released last week by the Food and Agriculture Organisation [FAO]. Upper Egypt and other regions were not hit as bad, the statement said, but it warned of further serious implications for food security in the whole region.

The United Nations agency, which sent an emergency team at the request of the Egyptian government to assess the situation, suggested a new disease containment strategy focusing on limiting the spread through various measures, including vaccination.

Engineer Mohamed Halawa was one of a handful of brave customers who entered El Hoda butchery.

"I boycotted meat for one month now, but when I saw the agriculture minister on TV explaining the rare occurrence of transmission of the disease to humans, I resumed eating meat again," Halawa said.

Dr. Amr Kandil, head of the Health Ministry Preventive Medicine Department, said that cases of transmission of FMD from animals to humans are extremely rare.

A colorful poster covers the entrance to the veterinary medicine department of Shebin al-Kom, showing the different symptoms and stages of the disease. The poster is part of the Health Ministry’s plan to raise awareness about the epidemic. [The poster can be seen at the source URL. - Mod. AS].

Dr. Hussein Mahmoud, veterinary doctor at the General Quarantine Department, said the ministry is making extraordinary efforts to contain the spread of the virus and educate farmers.

"The situation is not entirely new; FMD has been circulating in the country for a few years now," he said. "What is new this year is the number of affected cattle and introduction of the new virus strain, which meant it took longer to immunize the livestock."

For several years, there has been a large deficit between local meat production and consumption in Egypt, which was mostly covered by large imports. Egypt is currently one of the top of meat importers in the world.

The current FMD outbreak presents a risk to about 6.3 million buffalo cattle and 7.5 million sheep and goats in Egypt. The disease is described as a highly contagious viral vesicular disease of cloven-hoofed animals. Although seldom lethal in adult animals, it causes serious production losses and is a major constraint in international trading of livestock products.

The latest report from the General Authority for Veterinary Services raised the number of infected animals to more than 61,000 animals, finding more than 10,000 have died from it. [A more recent update is included in item 1 above].

In the government efforts to contain the crisis, Prime Minister Kamal al-Ganzouri held a meeting with cabinet members last week, during which Agriculture Minister Mohamed Reda Ismail announced that the vaccine to combat FMD will be produced locally.

In the meeting, Ganzouri confirmed that the government is currently considering methods to compensate farmers.

Compensation will be given based on reports by veterinarians or by the veterinary unit in each governorate, and not through complaints filed at police stations," Ganzouri announced.

Farmers are not required to be compensated for FMD infections under Egyptian law, but the government is considering ways to compensate farmers, he said, especially after ruling military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi promised to solve the problem.

With a relative improvement in the situation, many experts say the FMD crisis could end in early April because warmer temperatures might help deter the disease.

Aswan gang exploiting "mouth" of the monument and injected cattle sera "garlic and lemon"
-----------------------------------------------------
Following a police investigation in Edfu, in the governorate of Aswan, 4 people were arrested on Fri, 6 Apr 2012, accused of fraud. They pretended to be veterinary doctors assigned by UN agency UNESCO to control FMD by vaccination. The fake vaccine they applied, charging farmers and livestock owners EGP 20 per head, was composed of garlic and garlic and lemon juice. Their car carried a poster saying "the national campaign to combat foot and mouth disease in collaboration with UNESCO". The 4, (20, 24, 25 and 33 y old) came from Sohag and Luxor.

The prosecution has taken over the investigation.

[Egypt's major FMDV SAT2 epizootic has probably approching its peak; past experience in the region has shown peaks in April-May.

The 2 main questions at present are:
- would this widely disseminated virus become endemic in Egypt?
- is the virus going to continue its spread to other counties in the region?

As shown in item 4 above, the issue has obtained serious economic dimensions in Egypt. An expression of the potential political implications is included in the following comment by Omar El Sabh, published on 5 Apr 2012 in The Daily News Egypt:

"The FJP’s [Freedom and Justice Party] threats to hold a no confidence vote over the Ganzoury government run in tandem to what the Brotherhood's leadership fears day by day, the reduction of its popularity in the street. The gas and bread crises, continued depletion of foreign reserves with no compensatory policies, the spread of the Foot and Mouth Disease in the countryside, and the continuous state of lack of security and other governmental fiascos are but a few issues that could abate the Brotherhood’s popularity". http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/letters/mr-successful-and-scaf-dp5.html.

This is reminiscent of other major FMD outbreaks in recent years (e.g., UK, Japan, S. Korea). During the 2001 UK epizootic, the intervention of PM Tony Blair was sought and the elections had to be postponed. - Mod.AS
