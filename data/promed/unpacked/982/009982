From: Arnold Bosman <bosmana@globalxs.nl>

For the second year in succession the Regional Public Health Service of
Rotterdam received a notification of legionellosis, presumably originating
from a source on a river cruise ship. On July 15th, an American tourist
returned in the States with severe pneumonia. The diagnosis Legionnaires'
disease was established. This was conveyed to the travel agent (and
presumably also to CDC), who relayed the message to the ship owners in
Rotterdam. The Regional Public health Service started investigations
immediately, taking water samples from hot water systems, showers,
whirlpool and sauna on board. The entire fresh water volume was replaced
and treated with Hadex as a precaution. The whirlpool was put out of order
until the results of the water samples are known. Air-processing equipment
are being monitored and sampled. The ship is now in Austria.
Last year, 6 British tourists acquired Legionnaires' disease on board a
river cruise ship. Then the whirlpool was found to contain high
concentrations of _Legionella pneumophila_. There was no practice of
applying chlorine to the whirlpool water, nor to check the water regularly.
This whirlpool was put out of order permanently, and the owners were
pressed to improve their maintenance procedures.
This year we only have this one report of the American tourist. But there
is a real possibility that more people were infected, and have been
hospitalized with Legionnaires' disease.
Could anyone who has information of patients with Legionnaires' disease who
recently have made a boat trip in Europe send me details? It would improve
our source investigation.
