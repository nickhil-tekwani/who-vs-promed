The Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) announced today [22 May 2014] that a Texas County adult has died due to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS).

This is the 1st case confirmed in Oklahoma during 2014, and the 5th Oklahoma case since hantavirus [infections] were 1st recognized in the United States in 1993. During 2013, 2 cases of HPS occurred in Oklahoma; both individuals died as a result of this disease. All Oklahoma cases have been from northwestern Oklahoma. Investigations of each HPS case revealed exposure likely occurred when dust was stirred up in rodent-infested areas while cleaning.

Hantavirus [infection] is a life-threatening disease spread to humans by rodents that has symptoms similar to influenza. Hantavirus[es] are carried by rodents, especially deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_ in North America]. The virus is found in their urine and feces, but it does not make the animal sick.

It is believed that humans can get sick with this virus if they come in contact with [virus] contaminated dust from mice nests or droppings. You may come in contact with the dust when cleaning homes, sheds, or other enclosed areas that have been empty for a long time. Hantavirus[es] do not spread between humans [in North America].

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) divides the symptoms of hantavirus between "early" and "late" symptoms. Early symptoms include fatigue, fever and muscle aches, especially in the large muscle groups -- thighs, hips, back, and sometimes shoulders. These symptoms are universal. There may also be headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. About half of all HPS patients experience these symptoms.

Late symptoms of HPS occur 4-10 days after the initial phase of illness. These include coughing and shortness of breath, with the sensation of, as one survivor put it, a "tight band around my chest and a pillow over my face" as the lungs fill with fluid. HPS has a mortality rate of 38 per cent, according to the agency.

The OSDH urges residents to be mindful of the presence or evidence of wild rodents when conducting clean-up activities in a house, barn or other out buildings, especially in rural areas. Infected rodents do not show signs of illness but shed the virus in their urine, feces, and saliva.

The OSDH recommends the following steps to safely clean up areas with possible rodent infestations or waste:
- ventilate areas inside of closed buildings for at least 30 minutes before you clean by opening doors and windows;
- use rubber gloves and spray the rodent nest, dead rodents, or droppings until soaked with a household disinfectant solution of 1.5 cups of bleach in 1 gallon of water;
- remove the nest or rodent(s) using a long-handled shovel or rubber gloves;
- double-bag the nest and dispose in trash. Persons in rural areas may bury the waste 2 to 3 feet deep;
- spray the area again with the disinfectant solution;
- wear rubber gloves and wipe up the area with paper towels or rags and double-bag and dispose them in trash container;
- wash your hands with soap and water immediately after the cleanup.

[Although not stated in the report above, the virus involved in this HPS case probably is Sin Nombre virus (SNV), which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_). This is the season for spring cleaning in North America, and closed buildings that have been unused over winter often provide habitats for deer mice and become sites for human exposure to Sin Nombre virus. In addition to Sin Nombre virus, rodents are the principal hosts of 4 other hantaviruses known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in North America. The above recommendation to avoid exposure to the virus is prudent and easy to carry out. Although Sin Nombre virus infections with HPS are relatively rare, the risk of death is significant.
