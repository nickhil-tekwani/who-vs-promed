A preliminary bird flu test at a farm in southern Japan came back
positive early Friday [12 Jan 2007] evening, said prefectural
official Masao Tanaka, but he cautioned that the final results
wouldn't be known until at least early Saturday.

Agricultural officials ordered a nationwide inspection of poultry
farms Friday after hundreds of chickens died this week in a suspected
bird flu outbreak.

The government order followed the deaths of 750 chickens Wednesday
and Thursday at the farm in the town of Kiyotake in Miyazaki
prefecture, an Agricultural Ministry official said on condition of
anonymity, citing protocol.

Japan's most recent outbreak occurred in Kyoto in 2004. Japan has had
several outbreaks of bird flu viruses that aren't harmful to humans
since then.[LPAI H5N2 in Ibaraki, 2005. - Mod.AS]. "We must ensure
early detection and disclosure (of an outbreak)," Vice Agriculture
Minister Masayuki Kunii told reporters earlier Friday.

Meanwhile, around 1600 more chickens had died by early Friday
evening, bringing the total to about 2400, Tanaka said.

The government has set up a task force and ordered 20 poultry farms
within a 10-kilometer radius of the affected operator to halt
shipments of eggs and chickens for the time being, said Toru Inoue,
another prefectural official.

Environment officials are also to conduct a national survey to look
into the possibility that a bird flu virus might have been brought by
migratory birds from other parts of Asia.

On Friday, prefectural health and agricultural officials were
inspecting the farm and sterilizing areas surrounding the pens, Inoue
said.

Authorities will take further epidemic prevention procedures if the
test confirms bird flu at the farm, including destroying the
remaining birds, he said. Miyazaki, about 900 kilometers southwest of
Tokyo, is the nation's largest poultry producing region.
