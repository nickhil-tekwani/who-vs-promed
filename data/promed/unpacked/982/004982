Summary
----------
Globally, influenza activity has decreased from its peak of activity in early 2015 to low levels in the Northern Hemisphere, while there were increases in activity in the Southern Hemisphere.

- In North America, influenza activity was at low, inter-seasonal levels. Influenza type B continued to be the predominant strain in circulation in recent weeks.
- In Europe, influenza activity remained low with influenza B predominant in recent weeks.
- In northern Africa, influenza activity remained at low levels in most countries with influenza A activity being predominant throughout the whole season.
- In western Asia, most countries reported decreasing influenza activity remaining at low levels in recent weeks.
- In the temperate countries of Asia, influenza activity remained at low levels.
- In tropical countries of the Americas, low inter-seasonal levels of influenza activity were reported in most countries except Peru where low levels of influenza type A circulation were detected.
- In tropical Asia, increased influenza activity was reported from Hong Kong (Special Administrative Region, China), Singapore, southern China, Viet Nam, and Sri Lanka with influenza type A viruses predominating in recent weeks.
- In the Southern Hemisphere, influenza activity increased in most of the regions but remained at low levels. However, South Africa reported high influenza activity with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) co-circulation in recent weeks.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 53 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 31 May 2015 to 13 Jun 2015 (data as of 25/06/2015 12:05 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 23 577 specimens during that time period. 1620 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1117 (69 percent) were typed as influenza A and 503 (31 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 172 (22.8 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 582 (77.2 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 69 (83.1 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 14 (16.9 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Note: Global epidemiology and surveillance updates are periodically collected from data reported by National authorities or organizations responsible for reporting this data.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------
North America

In North America, all countries reported low or inter-seasonal influenza activity. There was a prevalence of low circulation of influenza B virus. In Canada, overall influenza activity was slightly above expected levels but continued to decrease from previous reports. In the United States of America, influenza activity further decreased remaining below the national baseline for influenza activity. In Mexico, influenza detections decreased while acute respiratory infection (ARI) activity remained at a low level.

Europe

In all regions of Europe, influenza activity was detected at inter-seasonal levels. Most countries have reduced reporting and monitoring.

Northern Africa and Middle East

In northern Africa and the Middle East, influenza activity remained at low levels in all reporting countries. Throughout the season, influenza A activity was predominant throughout most countries with some co-circulation of influenza type B.

Western Asia

In western Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease in most countries. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activity was the predominant type in circulation but there was influenza type A(H3N2) and B circulation during the season as well.

Central Asia

In central Asia, the majority of countries reported low, inter-seasonal levels of influenza activity with influenza B virus predominating in most regions in recent weeks.

Eastern Asia

In Eastern Asia, influenza activity remained at low levels. The Republic of Korea, Japan, and North China have low levels of influenza type B activity while Mongolia reported low levels of influenza type A(H3N2) and B in recent weeks.

Countries in the tropical zone
--------------

Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean

Overall influenza activity in the Caribbean, Central America, and the tropical countries of South America continued to experience little to no influenza activity with only a few countries reporting slight increases in influenza detections in recent weeks. Peru had increased activity of influenza type A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09.

Central African tropical region

In Africa, low levels of influenza activity were reported in all regions except in West Africa where some countries have reported increasing levels of activity. Cote d'Ivoire had increased influenza activity. Ghana reported an increase in influenza activity since the last report with influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, and type B viruses co-circulating.

Tropical Asia

In tropical Asia, influenza activity was increasing in several of the reporting countries. Sri Lanka had high influenza activity with type A(H1N1)pdm09 virus predominating. Hong Kong (Special Administrative Region of China) reported increased influenza detections as well as elevated influenza-like illness (ILI) activity and hospitalization rates. Influenza type A(H3N2) was the predominant strain with little activity of influenza type B being reported. In southern China, influenza activity increased with influenza type A(H3N2) predominating as well as low levels of influenza type B (Yamagata strain) circulating. Viet Nam had slightly increasing influenza activity in the last few weeks. Singapore reported increasing influenza activity with co-circulation of influenza type A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09) and B.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
--------------------------

Influenza activity remained at low levels except in South Africa, but was increasing in most of the reporting countries in the southern hemisphere. In South Africa, influenza activity was elevated with influenza type A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 predominating in recent weeks. In Australia, influenza-like illness (ILI) levels were low but increasing. There were reports of the co-circulation of influenza type A(H3N2) and B. New Zealand reported a slight increase in influenza activity with overall low levels. Both influenza type A(H3N2) and B were predominating with low circulation of influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09. Temperate South America reported that influenza activity remained at expected levels for this time of year. RSV is elevated and predominant in this region. Paraguay had an increase in influenza A(H3N2). In the Pacific Islands, ILI activity was low in several islands.

Source of data
-------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System) FluID (epidemiological data reported by national focal points) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.
