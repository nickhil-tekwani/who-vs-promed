Greenville [South Carolina] Health System [GHS] officials announced new plans in place following an investigation into the bacterial infection that may have contributed to 4 patients' deaths following surgical procedures. Hospital officials said their investigation determined that the _Mycobacterium abscessus_ organism originated in the water, though preliminary findings could not identify a specific process or piece of equipment that triggered the outbreak in 15 patients.

GHS said no new infections have occurred, but a 4th patient has died and they say it is possible the infection was a contributing factor. 2 patients with the infection remain hospitalized and all 15 had "serious underlying medical conditions," according to GHS. In response to the outbreak, GHS said they have installed bacteriologic point-of-use water filters in a hospital operating room setting in the wake of a surgical infection that affected the 15 patients.

"We now believe that surgery processes involving the use of tap water may have inadvertently brought the organism into the perioperative environment," said Robert Mobley Jr, MD, medical director of quality at GHS. "Although we use sterile water in or near the surgical sterile field, even something as seemingly safe as pre-surgery handwashing may have contributed. At this time, we have not been able to find any single cause or process as the trigger for the outbreak, but we've taken extraordinary measures to protect our patients -- and believe we've succeeded. With patient safety as our 1st priority, we are taking protective measures to prevent further exposure to tap water in the operative environment."

According to the hospital system, the bacterium is harmless in most cases but can lead to infections if it comes into contact with surgical sites, especially in patients with weakened immune systems. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the organism is in most tap water including water studies down at Greenville Memorial Hospital.

GHS said letters were sent, via regular and certified mail, to about 180 patients [on whom] specific cardiopulmonary surgical equipment was used, out of an abundance of caution.

DHEC [South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control] released the following statement regarding the investigation into the infection:

It is important for the public to understand that the quality of Greenville's drinking water is not at issue in this case. Contamination of a sterile field with non-sterile water during invasive procedures may result in an infection of this type. Even at high levels, ingestion of _M. abscessus_ is not typically a risk for infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

_M. abscessus_ is an environmental contaminant and can be found in water and dust. In the healthcare setting, exposure to _M. abscessus_ may best be avoided by preventing non-sterile water contamination of medical equipment and supplies. Prevention efforts should focus on eliminating potential contamination of the surgical field by any form of unsterilized water, as well as assuring meticulous adherence to good general infection prevention methods.

DHEC has provided the hospital with a complete list of recommendations intended to help prevent this type of infection in the future, many of which have already been implemented.

[Since March 2014, a total of 15 surgical patients at a South Carolina hospital have developed post-operative _Mycobacterium abscessus_ infections attributed to the hospital's tap water. From another news source, 12 of the 15 patients had undergone cardiac surgery; 2 abdominal surgery; and one a neurological operation (http://endoscopereprocessing.com/2014/06/3-dead-15-test-positive-ghs-infection-case-wspa-news-7/). The types of infections, such as pulmonary, bloodstream, intravenous catheter, urinary, surgical site, have not been not named. The infections apparently could not be traced to one piece of equipment or process as originally thought, but tests showed that water inside the hospital contained the _M. abscessus_ (http://endoscopereprocessing.com/2014/06/3-dead-15-test-positive-ghs-infection-case-wspa-news-7/). We are told in the news report above that "surgery processes involving the use of tap water may have inadvertently brought the organism into the perioperative environment." However, we are not told how the contaminated tap water actually came in or near what should have been a sterile surgical field to infect the 15 patients; nor are we told whether molecular testing has been done to confirm that the genotypes of the water and the 15 clinical isolates of _M. abscessus_ are identical. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information from knowledgeable sources about this outbreak.

_Mycobacterium abscessus_ (formerly _M. chelonae_ subspecies _abscessus_) is an acid-fast bacillus that is part of a grouping separate from _M. tuberculosis_ complex and known as non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) (http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/mycobacterium.html). NTM differ among themselves on the basis of in vitro growth rate, colonial pigmentation and rapid molecular diagnostics. Non-pigmented, rapidly growing mycobacteria species (RGM) produce mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation and include the _M. fortuitum_ complex and the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group. A subset _M. abscessus_ group has been recognized and includes _M. abscessus_ sensu stricto, _M. massiliense_ and _M. bolletii_. Pigmented, intermediately growing NTM require 7-10 days to produce mature growth on agar plates and include _M. marinum_ and _M. gordonae_. Slowly growing NTM, which require more than 7-10 days to produce mature growth on agar plates, include _M. kansasii_ and the _M. avium/intracellulare_ complex. NTM are environmental mycobacteria found in water, soil, and dust that can contaminate medications and products, including medical devices.

Outbreaks of infections due to RGM are generally related to subcutaneous injection of substances contaminated with the bacterium or through invasive medical procedures employing contaminated equipment or implanted devices. (For example, see Padoveze MC, et al. Outbreak of surgical infection caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria in breast implants in Brazil. J Hosp Infect. 2007; 67(2): 161-7; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17881086).

Also, nosocomial RGM infection has followed use of contaminated skin markers in cosmetic plastic surgery (Safranek TJ, et al. _Mycobacterium chelonae_ wound infections after plastic surgery employing contaminated gentian violet skin-marking solution. N Engl J Med. 1987; 317(4): 197-201; abstract available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198707233170403). Infection can also occur after accidental injury where the wound is contaminated by soil. RGM also cause disseminated infection in immunocompromised patients.

_M. abscessus_ in particular is a cause of serious lung infections in persons with various chronic lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, where it has been a contraindication to lung transplantation (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053249806003263). These infections are severe and especially difficult to treat because of the resistance of _M. abscessus_ to many antibiotics. The few drugs that have in vitro activity against _M. abscessus_ include clarithromycin, aminoglycosides, cefoxitin, tigecycline, and imipenem. Recommendations are to combine clarithromycin with at least one other drug, such as an aminoglycoside (usually amikacin) or perhaps one other injectable drug such as cefoxitin or imipenem, depending on results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/01/30/jac.dkr578.full).

The total duration of therapy that is usually recommended is 6 to 12 or more months (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/12/1756.full). Localized disease typically responds to 6 months of therapy in immunocompetent hosts, and lung or disseminated infections can require over 6 months of therapy. Surgical resection in patients with areas of focal severe bronchiectasis and/or cavitary pulmonary disease, aimed at decreasing the mycobacterial load and removing a reservoir of infection, when combined with multidrug antibiotic therapy, has been reported to result in more prolonged microbiologic responses (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/5/565.long). - Mod.ML
