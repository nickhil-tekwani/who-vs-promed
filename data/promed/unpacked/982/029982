The UN Children's Agency (UNICEF) reported this week [week of 11 Aug 2014] that health workers have succeeded in slowing down the outbreak of the deadly disease cholera in Wau Shilluk town of Upper Nile State in South Sudan. UNICEF South Sudan, in its 11th situation report on the outbreak, dated 12 Aug 2014, noted, "the rate of new cases has steeply declined in Wau Shilluk." As of 10 Aug 2014 there were 894 cases reported in Wau Shiluk, with 17 deaths.

In order to prevent spread of the disease, aid workers are continuing to chlorinate drinking water supplies in the area, which are fetched from the Nile river. Cholera treatment centres also remain open in the nearby town of Malakal.

UNICEF also reports that the rate of new cases in Juba has slowed, as health education and sanitation campaigns continue. "With fewer new cases in Juba, the Cholera Treatment Centre (CTC) at Juba Teaching Hospital has been handed over to the Ministry of Health and the Gumbo and Nyakuron CTCs have been closed," states the update by the UN Agency. However, the treatment centre in Gurei is being maintained in case of a potential second cholera wave in Juba.

Nationwide so far at least 123 people have died in the cholera outbreak. The disease is still widespread in Eastern Equatoria, and has affected all the payams [administrative division] in Torit County and almost all the counties in Eastern Equatoria. The affected area in Eastern Equatoria is vast, according to UNICEF, noting that there is "movement of people within counties and to/from Juba, in addition to having poor access to safe water and sanitation."

[2] Cholera - Ghana (Greater Accra Region)

A cholera outbreak in Ghana's capital has reached "staggering" levels, an official said Fri 15 Aug 2014, blaming poor sanitation and overcrowded health facilities for the rapid spread of the disease. Cholera has killed more than 40 people in Accra since June 2014 and infected 3100 others, according to the Ghana Health Service.

While the sprawling city has been hit by cholera before, the director of health services for the greater Accra region, Linda Van Otoo, said the current outbreak was "staggering". "It is a total outbreak and the cases in Accra keep increasing daily," Otoo said. "We are in a pandemic situation and doing our best to deal with it."

Otoo puts the blame for the outbreak on poor sanitation in Accra's more impoverished districts.

The Sekondi/Takoradi Metropolis has recorded 23 suspected cases of cholera with 9 confirmed. Dr Emmanuel Tinkorang, the Western Regional Director of the Ghana Health Service, told the GNA that there were only 4 cases last week [week of 4 Aug 2014] but the figures had increased with cases coming from Kojokrom, Adiembra, Kwesimintsim, and Effia-Kuma.

He said it was a dent on the country's image that urban centres were recording cholera cases which is mainly an environmental and sanitation disease and appealed to the public to keep the environment clean as this was one key way of preventing the disease.

Dr Tinkorang said filth and garbage had taken over major cities and towns and called for attitudinal and behavioral change among urban dwellers. Mrs. Margaret Annan, Nurse Manager of Kwesimintsim Hospital confirmed to the GNA that a cholera patient had been treated and discharged at the facility.

Efforts are under way to stop the spread of a cholera epidemic that has already affected hundreds of people in Cameroon, reports global children's charity Plan International. More than 1600 cases have been reported in the Far North region of the country, with 74 deaths.

Plan is working to raise awareness about the importance of hygiene and prevention, as fears grow over the disease. "We're providing drugs to treat cholera, disinfecting public spaces and coordinating awareness campaigns in affected areas," says Felix Addo-Nyarko, Plan's Deputy Country Director in Cameroon.

Parts of Godhra [Panchmahal district, Gujarat state] have been declared cholera affected after a case surfaced in the town. Areas surrounding the town have been declared as cholera threatened in the wake of the case. A youth from Signal Falia, admitted at civil hospital with symptoms of cholera, was tested positive for the disease.

Godhra sub-divisional magistrate NF Vasava who has been designated as the cholera control officer said that the areas falling within a radius of 3 km of Signal Falia have been declared as cholera affected. While the case is the only one to be reported in the town, the declaration is mandatory under the Cholera Control Act.

Areas falling within an 8 km radius of the Godhra town have also been declared as cholera threatened. The administration has started distributing chlorine tablets to the residents besides starting super chlorination of water being supplied in the town. Vasava said that necessary precautions were being taken in the town.

[6] Diarrhea - India (Maharashtra State)

Over 250 people of Niphad village -- the taluka [similar to a county] headquarters [Nashik district, Maharashtra state] -- have been reported to be suffering from diarrhea, of whom 72 have been admitted to hospital since 4 Aug 2014. District health officials on Sunday said the department has declared an 'outbreak' of acute diarrheal disease at the village.

"As many as 72 people from Niphad were detected to be suffering from diarrhea and admitted to government hospitals, while 181 people who have been treated in out patient departments (OPD) were from Niphad and its surrounding villages," said Sushil Wakchaure, the district health officer (DHO).

All measures are being taken at the level of primary health centres to contain the spread of the disease, including measures to improve the water supply system.

"There are over 1500 people from the village or its surrounding areas who have been suffering from a number of ailments. The number of those suffering from diarrhea was 253. None of the patients were serious," said Dr Sahebrao Gawle of Niphad sub-civil hospital. Health officials have sounded an alert and medical teams have been rushed to the village to identify and treat those affected by the disease.

The officials said that though an outbreak had been declared locally, the final confirmation of the same would be done only after the DHO receives reports of stool samples sent to Pune. Officials are still trying to identify the cause, but primarily, this seems to be linked to the very old water supply line in Niphad that might have been punctured at more than one site, resulting in contaminated water.

At least 150 cases of foodborne illness has been reported in the Shihabieh area in Karak, Jordan, according to a Jordan Times report Mon 11 Aug 2014. An unspecified number of patients who presented with symptoms required hospitalization. Laboratory analysis on the stool samples of the patients and from a local restaurant that serves hummus revealed the presence of Shigella.

"The ministry's health team took precautions by closing the suspected restaurant until the results of the samples taken from there are fully tested," head of the ministry's communicable diseases department, Bashir Qasir told reporters.
