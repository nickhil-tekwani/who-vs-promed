Burial mound suggested to cut west's surplus of carcasses
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A clay mound the size of a football pitch to be filled with 30 000
decomposing sheep and cattle has been suggested for the west country to
solve a crisis of unburied animals. The Ministry of Agriculture is so
desperate about carcasses lying in fields and barns that it refuses any
longer to publish the figures, and is considering the mound plan, put
forward by the National Farmers' Union. It was suggested to the farmers by
Ian White, regional waste manager for the environment agency until he
retired last year. He said that the clay-lined mass grave would allow rapid
mass burial. The mound would be drained at the bottom to prevent pollution
getting into the water table -- the main risk with burying carcasses.
Dr White said that, because of continuous heavy rain, it was proving very
difficult to find suitable burial sites. Although rendering carcasses was
the best option, there was not enough capacity. He described his idea as
being a simple engineering technique. "We need a large flat field, which
would be covered in a thick layer of impermeable clay, of which we have
plenty in this area. Then the field would be surrounded by high banks, or
bunds." He said these banks would need to be 5 to 10 meters high depending
on the volume of animals to be buried, but either way would provide a large
space to pile sheep and cattle carcasses.
Dr White calculated that an area 60 meters by 30 meters by five meters high
could take up to 30 000 sheep, but if cattle were buried as well it would
need to be larger. Once filled, it would be sealed with a layer of clay on
top. Gradually, as the carcasses decomposed, the mound would sink. "It
would be like a very large stone age barrow by that stage," he said.
Ian Johnson for the NFU in Devon said: "We think this is a very good idea.
Our members are desperate. It is very upsetting and unsavory, to put it
mildly, to have your animals lying about for up to a week. The ministry has
been concentrating on killing infected animals, but then the army has
nowhere to take them."
Over much of the country yesterday the ministry was clearly falling behind
its targets of catching up. Although the disposal of animals has speeded up
in Cumbria with the giant pit at Great Orton airfield, it has slowed
elsewhere. There were 1 150 000 animals hit by foot and mouth, of which 385
000 were awaiting slaughter. An unknown number had been killed but were
unburied. The ministry had published a daily figure until 2 days ago, but
stopped doing so when the figure passed 192 000.
Signs of the system breaking down were showing yesterday in the north east,
acknowledged by the government chief scientist, David King, as a new hot
spot. Among the 33 new cases yesterday, bringing the total to 1058, was a
farm at High Whinholme in Northallerton in North Yorkshire where there are
1110 pigs and 670 sheep. This is the first case among pigs for some days --
and a serious development, because pigs spread the virus much faster than
other farm animals.
North of England NFU leaders were warning that things could get "10 times
worse," and felt they were losing the battle against foot and mouth disease
because of too much "bureaucracy." Their perception was that there does not
seem to be the will or the common sense to grasp that, or to cut through
bureaucratic nonsense and red tape to give people the resources they need
to beat this disease. The stark warning was issued following a meeting on
Tyneside between farming union leaders and Pat Sellers, from the department
of science and technology, a division of the Department of Trade and Industry.
A mass incineration of carcasses at an airfield in Shropshire has been put
on hold after protesters threatened legal action. Residents and businesses
close to Tern Hill airfield, near Market Drayton, have expressed their
concern at possible contamination from the pyre and its implications for
health. An alternative site is being found.
