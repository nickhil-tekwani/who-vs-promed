Pangkajene Islands (Pangkep) Health Agency in South Sulawesi [Sulawesi Selatan province] has declared a health emergency (KLB) in the regency following reports of dozens of students suffering from hepatitis A. The disease was detected at SMAN 2 state senior high school in Pangkep, where 93 students were said to be infected. Around 30 of the students are still being treated at Pangkep General Hospital, while the rest are undergoing out-patient treatment.

Pangkep Health Office head Indriati Latif said the disease had spread. Besides students from SMAN 2, a number of students from SMAN 1 and SMPN 2 junior high school were also reported to be suffering from hepatitis A. "This is a KLB due to the significant number of cases. We have reported this to the South Sulawesi Health Agency," Indriati said on Wednesday [8 Oct 2014].

The outbreak was revealed early this week when Pangkep SMAN 2 principal A. Noor received a report from a teacher on Monday [6 Oct 2014] that many students were sick and had been receiving treatment in hospital since Sunday [5 Oct 2014]. It turned out that they had contracted hepatitis A.

"We immediately called the local health office to conduct examinations in our school, and based on the results, a number of students who had their blood samples analyzed tested positive for hepatitis A," he said on Wednesday [8 Oct 2014]. The examinations were conducted until Tuesday [7 Oct 2014], but the number of affected students increased. Some of them were even brought to hospital by their parents.

"As of Wednesday [8 Oct 2014], 93 students have been infected by the disease," Firdaus said.

To prevent the disease from spreading, the school has canceled classes until Saturday [11 Oct 2014], during which an intensive cleaning and sterilization operation will take place at the school. The school's canteen will also close and its equipment will be cleaned.

Indriati said the source of the infection remained unclear as her office was still waiting for the food sample analysis conducted by her office and the Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM). "Hopefully, the test results will be available soon," said Indriati.

The health office has advised the families of patients infected by hepatitis A to not mix eating utensils used by patients and family members to prevent infections. Parents have also been urged to arrange vaccinations for their children.

However, Indriati said the cost of vaccinations was still considered expensive as it was not covered by the government. "Each shot costs Rp 600 000 [about USD 49] and it is not covered by the free health program," said Indriati.

[Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus is spread by fecal-oral transmission. Hepatitis A is closely associated with inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms. Hepatitis A occurs sporadically and in epidemics worldwide, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences. Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with sewage contaminated- or inadequately treated water.

Casual contact among people does not spread the virus. In developing countries [where sanitary conditions are poor], most children experience infection in early childhood. As a consequence of poor sanitary conditions and hygienic practices, most children (up to 90 percent) have been infected with the hepatitis A virus before the age of 10. Those infected in childhood do not often experience any noticeable symptoms. Consequently, epidemics are uncommon because older children and adults are generally immune. Symptomatic disease rates in these areas are low, and outbreaks are rare.

In developed countries with adequate sanitary conditions, prior to the availability of the hepatitis A vaccine, children often escape infection in early childhood. Ironically, these improved economic and sanitary conditions may lead to a higher susceptibility in older age groups, and [because infections that occur in adolescents and adults are more often symptomatic] higher disease rates and large foodborne outbreaks may occur.

Sulawesi (formerly known as Celebes) is an island in Indonesia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulawesi). One of the 4 Greater Sunda Islands, and the world's 11th-largest island, it is situated between Borneo and the Maluku Islands. In Indonesia, only Sumatra, Borneo, and Papua are larger in territory, and only Java and Sumatra have larger populations.

Sulawesi comprises 4 peninsulas: the northern Minahasa Peninsula; the East Peninsula; the South Peninsula; and the South-east Peninsula. Three gulfs separate these peninsulas: the Gulf of Tomini between northern Minahasa peninsula and East Peninsula; the Tolo Gulf between East and Southeast Peninsula; and the Bone Gulf between the South and Southeast Peninsula. The Strait of Makassar runs along the western side of the island and separates the island from Borneo. - Mod.LL
