New research strategy offers hope to pastoralists battling mystery cattle disease in southern Flinders Ranges

South Australia's peak livestock body wants more research funding to help solve mysterious cattle deaths that have left pastoralists and vets baffled for more than a century.

About 30 pastoralists from the Hawker and Craddock region have met with Livestock SA and PIRSA [Primary Industries and Regions SA] vets to discuss a strategy to tackle the unexplained stock deaths.

Termed the "November disease", the deaths typically occur within a single cattle or sheep mob without explanation from November to February in years when there is greater rain and more pasture in paddocks.

Clinical signs include drooling, diarrhea, neurological problems and in almost all cases, eventually leads to death, with autopsy results showing severe liver and kidney damage, intestine inflammation and brain lesions.

There are a number of theories about what could be causing the unexplained deaths with pulpy kidney suggested to be the cause in 2016, but that diagnosis has since been ruled out.

Other speculated causes are bacterial or fungal toxins from soil or plant matter but ultimately, the cause remains unknown.

Tracing the cause

PIRSA chief veterinary officer Roger Paskin said the sporadic nature of the disease made it difficult to investigate but thus far his team had ruled out all the known traditional bacteria, viruses and infectious conditions.

"Traditional veterinary medicine has brought us this far [but] is going to have to retire at this point so that we can then take it further using different technology," he said.

"We've noticed this disease tends to occur in November usually and is very often linked to a particular kind of rainfall pattern, so we need to elucidate fully so we understand the ecological triggers or the risk factors".

Dr Paskin said understanding those "ecological triggers" for the disease would be key to getting to identify the cause.

"It's obviously ecologically sensitive, something that's local [and] that pops up, together with certain weather-related events that we have yet to understand fully," he said.

"We've got a fairly shrewd idea of what the problem is -- probably some sort of plant or fungal-based toxin -- and we need to harness some really high and expensive technology to elucidate that.

"We need to isolate the toxin itself and for that, we need to have fresh samples of various bodily organs that we can get put into a laboratory, put through a spectrometer and then isolate those particular toxins and come back and look for those toxins in the pasture or soil."

Funding required for more research

Dr Paskin said funding for a research project would need to be two-fold: an initial grant to research the disease and secondary funding to implement preventative measures on properties.

"We're going to have a multi-disciplinary team working on this and it's going to take a few years and probably a few hundred thousand dollars which we are still looking for at the moment," he said.

"[Initially] we would be looking for probably AUD 200 000 to 300 000 [approx. USD 150 715 to 226 073] over a 2-year period.

"Hopefully [when] we have managed to figure out exactly what it is, we will then need to work on a kind of response mechanism which might also require funding.

"So there's a good few years of hard work ahead of us at the moment."

While vets and scientists are left puzzling over the unexplained deaths, the cost of losing livestock has put pastoralists around the region out of pocket and forced at least one grazier out of the cattle industry.

It is unknown the total number of livestock deaths, with many not officially reported until the mid-1990s, however anecdotal reports of unexplained livestock deaths have been occurring in the region as far back as the 1880s, occurring in spikes every 10 to 20 years.

In recent times PIRSA Biosecurity SA has recorded 138 cattle deaths between 1996 and 1997 on 10 properties, and 191 deaths in the Cradock area alone during the 2014-15 summer period.

It was estimated that around 50 to 100 sheep and 24 cattle deaths were reported to PIRSA in November and December 2016 as a result of this disease.

'Emotional time' for pastoralists

Livestock SA president Geoff Power said it had been an emotional time for pastoralists affected since the disease cropped up again in November [2016].

"They're quite emotive and they're frustrated that it has been going on for so long," Mr Power said.

"It doesn't happen every year but every few years it pops up and with the price of livestock at the moment, it's very costly. "It's not just the cost of the livestock, it's the emotive part of finding dead animals. Nobody likes to see that."

"I think the land holders in this area are probably feeling a little bit more positive than they were a few weeks ago but we've still got a long way to go."

Project could cost AUD 500 000 [approx. USD 376 789]

Mr Power said he was confident the cause could be determined with more advanced technology if authorities adequately funded a research project.

"It's a problem that's been occurring off and on for well over 100 years [and] both livestock SA and Biosecurity SA believe it's time to get a strategy as we go forward," he said.

"Biosecurity SA are working on the application at the moment, so it's a matter of putting the application together, costing it, taking it to the relevant funders and then progressing with the project.

"The use of the [spectrometry] machine could cost up to AUD 150 000 [approx. USD 113 036] for 18 months and there will be other expenses involved including researchers and other technical people.

"I would think it could be a project that could cost half a million dollars.

"There's no guarantees on this but I think we're quietly confident that we might be able to eventually nail this."

Collaborative approach

Similarities have been identified between 'November disease' cases in South Australia and unexplained cattle deaths in New South Wales.
Both industry and government representatives agree that a collaborative approach between governments in SA and NSW would be needed for the research project to have maximum impact.

"We see this as a partnership between Biosecurity SA, the relevant department in NSW, Livestock SA and NSW farmers and we'll be talking to them so we put a joint effort into getting the research done on this disease," Mr Power said.

No unidentified cattle deaths have been reported to PIRSA so far in 2017, however after recent rainfall and with other diseases such as salmonella currently present in the area, Dr Paskin urged pastoralists to keep a close eye on any stock showing symptoms.
He added that PIRSA was collaborating with pastoralists in the area to demonstrate how to collect field data and samples in the case of any unexplained deaths.

Graziers are being urged to report any suspicions of exotic disease to their nearest PIRSA office or the Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888.

[The photograph on the original article is likely staged as those dead cattle had been there a while as carcasses do not deteriorate that fast if it is a sudden death.

While this article tells us a lot about how much tracking the cause is going to cost and that it will take a substantial amount of time, it does not give us a good idea of the clinical signs.

The article mentions that some things, such as pulpy kidney disease have been ruled out. It gives a very general description of the animals, but it does not get into specifics. Nor does the article tell us much about the possible lesions on histopathological samples.

Given the fact this syndrome only occurs during certain weather patterns without a constant year to year situation, it says to me it is likely a plant or a fungus, or a plant that under certain growing conditions produces a different toxin.

The International Symposium on Toxic Plants (ISOPPÂ® http://isopp10ism2017conference.com/index/984) was begun to share the commonalities as well as regulations, global issues with plants and host of other issues. One of the commonalities surfacing from this international collaboration was a similar situation as this but occurring in the spring (different hemispheres) in Texas, and termed Hard Yellow Liver or Hepatic Fatty Cirrhosis. The description given in the article is quite similar to the situation occasionally occurring in Texas, USA. Perhaps a notable difference is the neurological effect, only seen in the animals, both sheep and cattle, in the end stage when the liver is not functioning properly. Perhaps this is also the case in Australia. The article is not clear on that.

A better description of the situation may lend others to recognize similar syndromes. - Mod.TG
