[2] Prior Zika and dengue virus exposure
Date: Fri 14 Oct 2022

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22231-y


Citation: Valencia, B.M., Sigera, P.C., Weeratunga, P. et al. Effect of prior Zika and dengue virus exposure on the severity of a subsequent dengue infection in adults.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Given the structural similarity between Zika and dengue viruses, prior infection from one virus is hypothesized to modulate the severity of a subsequent infection from the other virus. A previous paediatric cohort study observed that a prior Zika infection may increase the risk of a subsequent symptomatic or severe dengue infection. The Colombo Dengue study is a prospective hospital-based cohort study in Sri Lanka that recruits symptomatic adult dengue patients within the 1st 3 days of fever. Anti-Dengue Envelope and anti-Zika NS1 IgG antibodies were tested by ELISA (Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany) in all recruited patients. Associations between pre-morbid seroprevalence for either or both infections and adverse clinical outcomes of the current dengue infection were explored. A total of 507 dengue infected patients were assessed of whom 342 (68%) and 132 (26%) patients had anti-dengue IgG and anti-Zika IgG, respectively. People with combined prior dengue and zika exposure as well as prior dengue exposure alone, were at increased risk of plasma leakage, compensated and uncompensated shock, and severe dengue (p < 0.05), compared to people without prior exposure to either infection. The effect of prior Zika exposure alone could not be established due to the small the number of primary dengue infections with prior Zika exposure.

[Prior Zika or dengue infection followed by a secondary dengue infection has been of significant concern for many years. In the above study, the combination of prior ZIKV and DENV exposure was associated with a higher risk of plasma leakage and other adverse outcomes during a subsequent DENV infection in adults as was DENV exposure alone. The independent effect of prior ZIKV exposure could not be discerned due to the low number of patients with prior ZIKV exposure alone. It would be of interest to repeat the prior Zika exposure study in the DENV endemic Americas where an extensive Zika virus outbreak had occurred relatively recently. - Mod.TY]

[3] EU endorses vaccine
Date: Fri 14 Oct 2022
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/eu-regulator-adopts-positive-opinion-dengue-vaccine-2022-10-14/


The European drugs regulator on Friday [14 Oct 2022] recommended a dengue vaccine from Japan's Takeda, paving the way for a 2nd vaccine for the mosquito-borne disease that causes millions of infections annually.

European Medicines Agency (EMA) advisors backed the use of the Takeda (4502.T) vaccine for those aged 4 and older to prevent any of the 4 so-called serotypes of dengue.

There are no antivirals or specific treatments for the mostly mild, flu-like viral disease. However, some people can develop life-threatening complications. Between 20 000 to 25 000 people, mostly children, die each year, according to the World Health Organization.

If approved, the Takeda vaccine would follow Sanofi's Dengvaxia -- the world's 1st dengue vaccine -- which was licensed in 2015 and took 2 decades to develop.

The use of the French drugmaker's vaccine was scaled back considerably after it emerged the vaccine increased the risk of severe disease in 'seronegative' children -- those who had no prior dengue exposure when they got the shot.

Takeda's vaccine, TAK-003, has not been evaluated in a head-to-head study with Dengvaxia, so it is not possible to make direct comparisons between the 2 vaccines, said Gary Dubin, president of Takeda's global vaccine business.

Still, there has been no evidence of disease enhancement in seronegative participants in Takeda's own trials, he said.

"This gives us further confidence in the safety of the vaccine regardless of previous dengue exposure."

Takeda's vaccine is based on a dengue 2 virus, with DNA from the other 4 serotypes added in. Data from a pivotal trial has shown the vaccine can induce immune responses to a varied degree against all 4 dengue types.

Compared to Dengvaxia, Takeda's vaccine shows wider protection for young children and people older than 45 years old, the EMA said on Friday [14 Oct 2022]. The final decision on approval will come in due course from the European Commission.

If approved, Takeda expects the vaccine to generate USD 700 million to USD 1.6 billion in sales over the course of several years, Dubin said.

In terms of pricing, Takeda is looking at a tiered model for the private and public markets, and for the endemic and travel markets, he added, without disclosing specifics.

[Development of an effective tetravalent dengue vaccine has been difficult. A vaccine for all 4 serotypes needs to be administered simultaneously to avoid setting up the vaccinees for antibody-dependent enhancement and more serious disease should a wild-type virus not in the vaccine be encountered. It will be interesting to see when the EU and other countries approve and license the Takeda vaccine. - Mod.TY]
