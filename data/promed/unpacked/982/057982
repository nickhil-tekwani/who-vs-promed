Health officials say 7 people in Nova Scotia have been infected with a potentially deadly strain of _E. coli_. Dr. Robert Strang, the province's chief public health officer, said all 7 people became ill between 23-26 Dec 2012, 3 in Halifax, 2 in Antigonish, one each in Truro and Stellarton. 5 people have been treated in hospital and released, while 2 people remain hospitalized. One is suffering from kidney failure.

Strang said 5 cases of _E. coli_ O157 have also been reported in New Brunswick, leading health officials to believe the common denominator is likely a food item that is sold in both provinces. "There's no definitive common source but certainly the pattern of the cases put together looks like some common food product that's been distributed widely," Strang told CBC News.

"We're working with our food safety colleagues in both provinces as well as with the Public Health Agency of Canada to investigate, identifying any further cases and also tracing back potential links in food products to try to identify a common source."

Strang said beyond the existing dozen cases, no new cases have been reported and it's hoped the food item in question is one with a short shelf life. "Our hope is that this has been a time-limited exposure of some type of a food product like a fruit or a vegetable that has a very limited shelf or market life," he said Thu 3 Jan 2013.

A total of 5 cases of a potentially deadly strain of _E. coli_ have been confirmed in New Brunswick, according to the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health. 2 of the cases of E. coli _O157_ were reported in the Saint John region in the past few days, while 3 were reported in the Fredericton area, said Dr. Eilish Cleary. One of the patients was admitted to hospital, the other 4 were treated in hospital and released, she said.

"We believe that a couple of those cases, at least, are a very similar type of _E. coli_ so we know that at least some of them are connected," Cleary told CBC News. "We're still looking into the more recent cases to determine whether they're all connected or not."

Officials are also investigating whether the outbreak might be linked to a number of cases in Nova Scotia in recent weeks, said Cleary. "A number of sources are being investigated and we are still gathering information."

_E. coli_ O157:H7 is the same strain that killed 7 people in Walkerton, Ontario, in 2000. It also led to the biggest beef recall in Canadian history in the fall of 2012. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency recalled more than 1500 beef products that were packed at XL Foods, a meat processing plant in Brooks, Alberta. _E. coli_ O157:H7 also put 2 Fredericton teenagers in hospital in July 2012, while an outbreak in Miramichi in April 2012 hospitalized at least 13 people.

During the Walkerton outbreak, at least 7 people died and about 2500 fell ill after the bacteria got into the town's water supply. The source of the contamination in that case was manure spread on a farmer's field near one of the town's wells. The cause of the Fredericton outbreak during the summer was undetermined. Romaine lettuce was deemed the likely source of the Miramichi outbreak in the spring of 2012.

Whether the EHEC cases in each of these 2 eastern Canadian provinces are all related epidemiologically is not yet known. Information from food surveys and from genetic analysis of the O157 strains will be needed in better understanding these cases.

Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) is also known as Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli (STEC) or Vero toxin-producing _E. coli_. It is one of the 6 enteropaths of _E. coli_ and the only one clearly zoonotic in origin. The seminal outbreak of EHEC O157:H7, the commonest EHEC serotype, burst on the scene in the 1st half of 1982 with 2 outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis affected at least 47 people in Oregon and Michigan, USA (1). Undercooked ground beef was found to be the vehicle. The serotype had been identified only once before by the CDC, in 1975 from a California woman with bloody diarrhea. The association of EHEC with hemolytic uremic syndrome quickly followed.

Other modes of transmission, mostly related to livestock manure contamination, include ingestion of all sorts of uncooked produce including lettuce, spinach, sprouts, and tomatoes, contaminated municipal or rural sources of drinking water and water for recreational purposes as well as direct animal exposure such as a petting zoo setting. Another important vehicle is unpasteurized dairy products including milk and cheese. Cheeses made from unpasteurized milk aged 60 days or more at a temperature of 35 degrees F is said to create conditions able to eradicate milkborne pathogens such as EHEC (FDA 21 CFR Part 133) but experimental findings as well as several outbreaks (2,3) have clearly shown that such recommendations need refinement. Physiological responses of EHEC, as measured by stress responses to acid, osmotic pressure and heat shock contribute together or individually to the survival of EHEC during raw milk cheese production (4)

Person-to-person transmission can also occur and may occur for as much as 20 percent of total cases (5) and is especially notable in household, day care and nursing home settings.
