A little less than 2 months before [the celebration of] carnival, Herrera province Regional Health confirmed the 2nd case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the Azuero region.

The patient, who is from Bebedero de Tonosi in the Los Santos province, was admitted to the emergency unit of the Cecilio Castillero Hospital in Chitre, and was transferred yesterday [18 Jan 2014] to the Santo Tomas Hospital in [Panama City] in order to receive better [medical] attention.

The 62-year-old patient presented with a clinical picture similar to dengue and hantavirus [infections], but after tests were done, he was confirmed positive for hantavirus [infection].

[Although the hantavirus involved in this cases is not specified, the one most likely responsible is Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20130204.1527935, of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.

The Chubut health agency implemented previously established health measures for positive cases of the disease, as well as epidemiological surveillance of the case contacts.

Through an official communication, the Chubut Ministry of Health reported a new hantavirus death that occurred on Fri 17 Jan 2014 in a private clinic in Trelew, although the victim, who had been in the Los Alerces Park, was from Puerto Madryn. The announcement was signed by the Subsecretary of the Agency, Eduardo Wassermann, and the Director of the Esquel Area Program, Veronica Lloyd.

The health authorities indicated that the death was communicated immediately to the Esquel Area Program, part of the health ministry, in order to convene the Chubut Interinstitutional Roundtable for the Massive Flowering of Colihue Cane [MIFCC by its initials in Spanish], and proceed with the applicable health protocol in the case of positive hantavirus [infection] cases."

The official announcement specified that "epidemiological surveillance of case contacts," was initiated early today [Sat 18 Jan 2014], as well as "monitoring and investigation in the Bahia Rosales Complex within the Los Alerces National Park, where the victim and his family were staying, in an attempt to establish if this is where the infection was contracted and its circumstances."

Finally, the Ministry of Health report stated that the authorities of the Los Alerces National and of the tourist complex are collaborating closely in the application of these protocols.

[This is not the 1st hantavirus pulmonary syndrome case associated with time spent in the Los Alerces National Park.

Although the specific hantavirus involved in this case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in this region is not specified, it most likely is Andes virus. Andes virus is the only hantavirus shown thus far to be transmitted directly from person to person, but only rarely, and among individuals in very close contact. Most infections are acquired from contact with excrement of infected rodents. Andes virus occurs in western Argentina, harbored by the long-tailed pygmy rice rat reservoir host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_. Populations of these rodents can increase significantly with the flowering and setting of seed of the Colihue cane, a food source for these Andes virus rodent reservoirs. The health authorities are to be commended for having, and rapidly implementing, protocols in response to the occurrence of this case.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_, can be seen at http://www.hantavirus.cl/educacion_prevencion/galeria_reservorio/oligoryzomys_longicaudatus.jpg.
