Butte County Public Health Department (BCPHD) is investigating a case of wound botulism in a Butte County resident who injected black tar heroin. Laboratory testing to confirm the diagnosis is pending. The patient remains hospitalized and on a ventilator. The source of the heroin is unknown at this time. Black tar heroin has been linked to other wound botulism outbreaks in injection drug users, so there is concern that locally available black tar heroin may be contaminated.

An average of 10 cases of wound botulism are reported each year in California. Wound botulism occurs when a wound becomes infected with _Clostridium botulinum_ (the cause of foodborne botulism) or a closely related _Clostridium_ bacterium. The bacteria multiply in the wound and create a toxin that acts on the nerves. Most, but not all, people with wound botulism will have a visibly infected wound. Persons injecting black tar heroin into their muscles ("muscling") or under their skin ("skin popping") are at highest risk of wound botulism. Persons with wound botulism cannot transmit the illness to others.

Symptoms of wound botulism occur within days or weeks of injecting contaminated drug and may be mistaken for drug overdose. Symptoms can include weak or drooping eyelids, blurred or double vision, dry mouth, sore throat, slurred speech, trouble swallowing, difficulty breathing, and a progressive symmetric paralysis that begins at the face and head and travels down the body. If left untreated, symptoms may progress to paralysis of the respiratory muscles, arms, legs, and trunk with subsequent death. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is critical to decreasing the severity and duration of illness. Any injection drug users with symptoms of wound botulism should seek medical attention immediately at the nearest emergency room. Wound botulism is treated with antitoxin that must be requested on a case by case basis from the CDC through the state health department.

[Most drug-related cases of wound botulism are related to black tar heroin which is injected subcutaneously instead of intravenously.

Black tar heroin https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tar_heroin: "is heroin acetate. Other forms of heroin require additional steps of purification post acetylation. With black tar the product's processing stops immediately after acetylation. Its unique consistency however is due to acetylation without a reflux apparatus. As in Homebake Heroin in Australia and New Zealand the crude acetylation results in a gooey mass. Black tar as a type holds a variable admixture of morphine derivatives--predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine) which is another result of crude acetylation. The lack of proper reflux during acetylation fails to remove much of the moisture retained in the acetylating agent, glacial acetic acid.

"Black tar heroin is often produced in Latin America, and is most commonly found in the western and southern parts of the USA, while also being occasionally found in western Canada and Europe. It has a varying consistency depending on manufacturing methods, cutting agents, and moisture levels, ranging in quality from a black-brown tarry goo in unrefined form to a uniform, light-brown powder when further processed and cut with lactose.

"People who intravenously inject black tar heroin are at higher risk of venous sclerosis than that inject powder heroin. In this condition, the veins narrow and harden, which makes repeated injection there nearly impossible. Researchers at UC-San Francisco have found that the rapidity with which black tar heroin destroys veins, along with its gummier consistency, may put people who inject it at a lower risk of HIV infection because they may be forced to inject subcutaneously (rather than into veins), and needles must be thoroughly rinsed free of 'black tar' between injections if new sterilized ones are not available.

"The presence of 6-monoacetylcodeine found in tar heroin has not been tested in humans but has been shown to be toxic alone and more toxic when mixed with mono- or di-acetyl morphine potentially making tar more toxic than refined diamorphine. At least 1 study has drawn attention to lower rates of HIV infection amongst drug injectors in which black tar heroin is the major form of street-available heroin, suggesting that this may be due to the need to heat black tar heroin to dissolve it (which also inactivates any HIV present in the solution).

"However, black tar heroin injectors can be at increased risk of life-threatening bacterial infections, in particular necrotizing soft tissue infection. The practice of 'skin-popping' or subcutaneous injection predisposes to necrotizing fasciitis or necrotizing cellulitis from _Clostridium perfringens_, while deep intramuscular injection predisposes to necrotizing myositis. Tar heroin injection can also be associated with _Clostridium botulinum_ infection." - Mod.LL
