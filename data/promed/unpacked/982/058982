This Friday [7 Oct 2022] Bolivia registered its 1st death caused by a monkeypox infection, which occurred in a man aged 28 years old, according to official reports.

At a press conference in which they emphasized not lowering their guard in the face of the epidemic, Marcelo Cuéllar, director of the San Juan de Dios Hospital, explained that the patient had crossed the viral phase of the disease and what would have caused his death was low immune response.

The hospital had been treating the patient since [17 Sep 2022]. At that time, the man already had complications due to immunosuppression along with skin lesions.

Santa Cruz is the epicenter of monkeypox infections in Bolivia, with 195 cases [equivalent to 90.6%] that have occurred in the country since the beginning of August [2022], according to data from SEDES [Departmental Health Services]. Of that number, 57 patients are under home isolation and another 7 have been receiving treatment at health centers designated for the care of the disease.

In its latest report, the Ministry of Health quantified 215 cases nationwide, of which 108 have been discharged and 107 remain active.

The infections have been concentrated in the departments of Santa Cruz (195), Cochabamba (11), La Paz (7), Potosí (1) and Chuquisaca (1).

New Zealand confirmed the 1st 2 community transmission cases of monkeypox on Thursday [6 Oct 2022], bringing the total case number to 11.

The 2 new cases have been identified as community transmissions where the disease has been transmitted within New Zealand as opposed to all other cases where the individuals were infected overseas, said a joint statement of the Ministry of Health and Health New Zealand.

The general risk remains very low, it said, adding the 2 new cases are isolated in Auckland.

"This is not unexpected and the number is likely to remain low," the statement said.

Mozambique has registered the country's 1st case of monkeypox detected in an adult male, announced the Ministry of Health on Thursday [6 Oct 2022].

The case was tested after showing symptoms and diagnosed on Wednesday [5 Oct 2022] in Maputo city and the individual in question had a travel history, said Health Minister Armindo Tiago at the press conference in Maputo.

"At this moment, the process of tracing all possible contacts is underway so that they can be submitted to the test," said Tiago.

The minister appealed to the public to remain calm in response to the emergence of the disease, and "to avoid panic and follow information about it through the official media."

The health sector is already training staff to work on identifying and treating cases of the disease, he said.

The country has been on high alert after the 1st case of monkeypox was confirmed in neighboring South Africa in June [2022].

Monkeypox is a contagious viral disease that occurs when the individual has very close and direct contact with an infected animal, or with infected individuals through the secretions of skin and mucosal lesions or droplets of the respiratory system.
