The information below was published by the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine on 6 Feb 2018, available at https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/animalhealthwelfare/diseasecontrols/avianinfluenzabirdflu/news/2018/AvianInfluenzaUpdate080218.pdf

"A white-tailed sea eagle tested positive for Avian Influenza subtype H5N6 on 5 Feb 2018. The bird was found dead on 31 Jan 2018 (week 5) in County Tipperary near Portumna. The sample has been sent for further testing and we should know within a few days whether it is highly or lowly pathogenic. This is the 1st occurrence of the H5N6 subtype in Ireland - although. It is likely that the virus was introduced into Ireland by migratory birds, and that the eagle became infected when scavenging a dead bird.

"HPAI H5N6 first appeared in the Netherlands on [22 Dec 2017] and has since spread to Germany, Switzerland, UK and Ireland. The UK has confirmed highly pathogenic H5N6 in wild birds in 12 mortality events in England since the beginning of January 2018. The latest case was confirmed on [5 Feb 2018] in a mute swan in Warwickshire in Central England".
