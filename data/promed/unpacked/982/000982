The USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) on Wednesday, 21 May 2014, named retailers in 9 states that may have received tainted beef. 2 days earlier, the FSIS announced that 1.8 million pounds of ground beef products were being recalled on fears that they could be contaminated with _E. coli_ O157:H7.

The federal agency named 5 stores in 9 states. They are as follows:
- Gordon Food Service Marketplace stores in Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wisconsin;
- Surf N Turf Market in Sebring, Florida;
- Giorgio's Italian Delicatessen in Stuart, Florida;
- M Sixty Six General Store in Orleans, Michigan;
- Buchtel Food Mart in Buchtel, Ohio.

Recalled cases of beef from Wolverine Packing Company in Detroit were produced between 31 Mar 2014, and 18 Apr 2014.

Based on investigations, 11 people across 4 states are suspected to have been sickened by the product.

A spokesperson for the USDA said the meat is in the process of being removed from store shelves, and until that process is over, consumers should return or destroy meat that has the code EST.2574B and has a production date between 31 Mar 2014 and 18 Apr 2014. The meat is sold under a variety of labels.

The list released Wednesday [21 May 2014] is not final, the spokesperson said. More establishments will be added as the USDA continues an investigation.

[Of the 11 cases noted by CDC, 1 was in Missouri and 1 in Massachusetts. Distribution to those states is not noted in this posting. ProMED-mail awaits additional information regarding the overall distribution of the ground beef and the scope of the outbreak.

The seminal outbreak of EHEC O157:H7 was associated with undercooked ground beef and this vehicle will remain prototypically associated with the infection. Commercial ground beef is not simply a piece of meat that is run through a grinder but rather it is usually produced in bulk using the parts of the cow remaining after primal cuts of beef (to produce steaks and roasts) are removed, usually from multiple cows and even different slaughterhouses. This lower grade product, called beef trim, tends to be cut from the parts of the cow more likely to have had contact with bovine sources of EHEC. - Mod.LL
