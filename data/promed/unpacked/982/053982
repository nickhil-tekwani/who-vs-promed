3 horses die at special-needs ranch
-----------------------------------
State veterinarians are investigating possible causes of death after 3
horses died mysteriously at a therapeutic riding ranch in Albuquerque's
South Valley.

[The owner] and her partner are special-education teachers who run
Chocollate New Mexico, a riding-therapy center that works with physically
and mentally challenged kids. "Children and adults that have been totally
nonverbal have started speaking," she said about the therapy results. The
animal interaction often works wonders for children with autism, she added.

But on Saturday [26 Sep 2009] something terrible happened at their home and
ranch. "I went out to feed, and our 18 month old miniature was dead," [the
owner] said. A few hours later a 2nd horse collapsed and started thrashing
violently. A vet euthanized it on scene after the horse bloodied itself
smashing into a metal trailer. On Sunday [27 Sep 2009] a 3rd horse died the
same way although this time it happened in front of several children.

Dr Flint Taylor of the New Mexico Department of Agriculture said 3 sudden
horse deaths in one place is a definite concern. "We can never rule out
anything until we rule it out," Taylor told KRQE News 13. He said disease
does not seem the likely culprit. However it is possible a toxic weed may
have somehow gotten onto the property or into a hay bale, Taylor continued.
"The animals that actually eat hay from that part of the bale and not from
another part will be affected while others animals on the premises may not
be affected," he said.

Necropsy results should be back by the end of the week. As for the
possibility of widespread tainted hay, Taylor said he has not heard any
recent reports of animals with similar sickness.

[The teachers] still have 5 horses but said it will be a challenge to keep
the program going. They're now facing thousands of dollars in veterinarian
bills and are not sure how they will pay them.

[A number of toxic plants grow in the Albuquerque area. Horses and other
animals normally avoid some toxic plants unless, during times of drought or
overgrazing, there is nothing else for the animals to eat. Toxic plants
baled into hay often are a source of toxicity because the animals are
forced to eat it since they cannot avoid it. Further information about the
clinical signs might help to identify plants that could be responsible. -
