Interim Guidance for Minimizing Risk for Human Lymphocytic
Choriomeningitis Virus Infection Associated with Rodents
-----------------------------------------------
In May 2005, CDC received reports of 4 organ-transplant recipients
with unknown illness. All were discovered to have been infected with
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) via a common organ donor
(1). Epidemiologic investigation traced the source of the virus to a
pet hamster purchased by the donor from a local pet store. LCMV
testing of other rodents at the pet store revealed 3 other
LCMV-infected rodents (2 hamsters and a guinea pig), supplied by a
single distributor (distributor A). Preliminary laboratory testing of
hamsters from distributor A has identified an infection rate of
approximately 3 percent among the animals sampled. The facility of
distributor A is under quarantine until it can be documented as free
of LCMV infection. This report provides background information on
LCMV and interim guidance for the public on reducing risk for LCMV
infection from pet rodents.
Background Information
-----------------------
LCMV is a rodent-borne arenavirus endemic in house mouse (_Mus
musculus_) populations worldwide (3, 4, 5). Pet rodents (e.g.,
hamsters and guinea pigs) can become infected with LCMV after contact
with wild rodents at a breeding facility, pet store, or home. The
prevalence of LCMV in pet rodents is not known. Although other
animals could possibly become infected with the virus, documented
infections in humans have occurred only after exposure to infected
mice, guinea pigs, and hamsters (6,7).
LCMV infection in humans with normal immune systems usually causes
either asymptomatic or mild, self-limited illness, characterized by
any or all of the following symptoms: fever, malaise, lack of
appetite, muscle aches, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Aseptic
meningitis also can occur in some patients, but the infection is
rarely fatal (6). LCMV infection during the 1st or 2nd trimester of
pregnancy can cause severe illness or developmental defects in the
fetus, including hydrocephalus, psychomotor retardation, and
blindness (8); the proportion of developmental defects caused by LCMV
is not known. Serologic studies of previous infection in humans in
urban areas of the United States have demonstrated a prevalence of
previous LCMV in those populations of approximately 5 percent (3).
Person-to-person transmission has not been associated with LCMV,
except for transmission from mother to fetus or through organ
transplantation (1). Human infection occurs most commonly through
exposure (by direct contact or aerosol) to secretions or excretions
of infected animals (9). LCMV infection is a well-known occupational
risk for laboratory workers who work with LCMV-infected laboratory
rodents (9).
An outbreak associated with pet hamsters sold by a single distributor
was reported in 1974, when 181 symptomatic cases in persons with
hamster contact were identified in 12 states; no deaths occurred
(10). The outbreak was brought under control by voluntary cessation
of sale and destruction of the infected breeding stock.
Control of Wild Rodents
-----------------------
Environmental modifications and hygiene practices that deter rodents
from colonizing the home and work environment are the best means of
reducing risk for exposure to infectious rodents. In addition, if
rodents are found in work or living areas, safe practices for
cleaning rodent waste and nesting materials are recommended.
Preventing wild rodent entry also reduces opportunity for infection
of pet rodents.
General Recommendations for Preventing LCMV Infection from Pet Rodents
-----------------------
Hamsters and other rodents are common pets, and the number of
documented human LCMV infections from pet hamsters and other rodents
is low. Basic precautions can reduce the risk for acquiring LCMV and
other infections from pet rodents. Because rodents might not always
exhibit signs of ill health resulting from LCMV infection, CDC
recommends taking appropriate precautions with any rodent:
(1) The public should be apprised of the risk for LCMV infection from
rodents purchased from any pet store.
(2) Destruction or return of recently purchased pet rodents is not recommended.
(3) The probability of any one animal harboring LCMV infection is low. All pets
are potential carriers of infectious diseases and should always be
handled by using appropriate precautions.
(4) Pet rodents must not be released into the wild to prevent
introduction of nonnative species to North America.
(5) Persons with specific concerns regarding the health of their pets
should seek guidance from a veterinarian.
Anyone handling or keeping pet rodents should take the following
precautions to reduce the risk for LCMV infection:
(1) Wash hands with soap and water (or alcohol-based hand sanitizers
when soap is unavailable and hands are not visibly soiled) after
handling pet rodents or cleaning up pet droppings, cages, or areas
where pets have been.
(2) Keep rodent cages clean and free of soiled bedding.
(3) Clean cages outdoors or in a well-ventilated area.
(4) Closely supervise young children when cleaning cages or handling
rodents and supervise or assist children in washing their hands
immediately after handling rodents and rodent cages or bedding. Never
kiss or hold pet rodents close to the face.
(6) Never allow pet rodents to come into contact with wild rodents or
their droppings or nests. Cover pet rodent cages and food supplies
and always supervise pet rodents when they are not in their cages.
Precautions for Pregnant Women
-----------------------
Although the risk for LCMV infection from pet rodents is low,
pregnant women or women who think they might become pregnant should
be aware of the risks associated with LCMV infection during
pregnancy. The following precautions can be taken to reduce the risk
for acquiring LCMV infection during pregnancy:
(1) Avoid contact with wild rodents. Pregnant women who reside in a
household with a wild rodent infestation should have the infestation
addressed promptly by a professional pest control company or another
member of the household.
(2) Keep pet rodents in a separate part of the home. Pregnant women
should ask another family member or friend to clean the cage and care
for the pet or arrange for temporary adoption of the pet by a
responsible person. Pregnant women should avoid prolonged stays in
any room where a rodent resides.
Precautions for Persons with Weakened Immune Systems
-----------------------
For the organ recipients described in this report, transplantation of
LCMV-infected organs into persons with medically induced
immunosuppression likely increased disease severity. Persons with
impaired immune-system function should avoid contact with all rodents.
Testing for LCMV in Pet Rodents
-----------------------
CDC does not recommend testing pet rodents. Serologic testing on
rodents can be inaccurate and misleading. All pet animals should be
assumed capable of transmitting certain infectious diseases.
Testing for LCMV in Humans
-----------------------
Testing for LCMV infection in asymptomatic persons is not necessary.
Similarly, testing persons with previous history of LCMV-compatible
illness generally is not useful. Persons with active disease
suggestive of LCMV should seek medical care and report any exposures
to wild or pet rodents. A physician should determine whether testing
for LCMV is indicated. Physicians should work closely with their
respective state health departments to discuss forwarding of samples
to state laboratories or CDC for testing.
