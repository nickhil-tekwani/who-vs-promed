The regional service of Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for
Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] has announced that a
dangerous bacterial potato disease has been imported to Kalmykia from
Egypt.

A batch of potatoes that came out of Egypt were infected with
bacterial brown rot. If an infected potato is planted, the next crop
will be infected. The pathogen can survive in the soil for up to 3
years and for up to 2 months in water and is capable of destroying up
to 90 percent of the crop.

Rosselkhoznadzor urges people to notify them of any suspicious
potatoes showing brown circles and sticky mucous exudates on the cut
surface to prevent the spread of this quarantine disease. It is
strictly prohibited to plant any infected tubers in private gardens.
Releasing infected potato waste into the environment also carries the
risk of spreading the bacterial pathogen.

[Brown rot (also called bacterial wilt) of potato is caused by
_Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 3 (biovar 2, adapted to cooler
temperatures) or race 1 (prevalent in warmer areas). These pathogens
can also affect tomato and other solanaceous plants. Different races
and biovars cause lethal wilting diseases on more than 200 known hosts
including many important crops.

Brown rot symptoms include internal staining and rotting of tubers,
wilting and death of plants and may result in substantial yield
losses. However, there may also be latent infections. The pathogens
can survive in potato tubers during storage posing a high risk for
introduction of the pathogen to new areas.

The bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including insects),
contaminated equipment, infected plant material (including seed
potatoes), soil and water. They can survive in soil, on plant debris,
or roots of hosts. Some weeds and unharvested potato plants may serve
as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management is difficult, relying
mostly on exclusion from new areas. Some cultural methods (such as
crop rotation) and limited genetic resistance may be used.
