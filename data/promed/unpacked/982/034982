Cambodia: Avian influenza Situation - WHO Update 15
---------------------------------------------------
As of 12 Apr 2005, The Ministry of Health in Cambodia confirmed that
an 8-year-old girl from Kampot province who died on 7 April, was the
country's 3rd case of avian influenza.
The girl became ill with a fever on the 29 Mar 2005. Her condition
deteriorated rapidly on 7 Apr 2005, when she was taken to a district
referral hospital and then transferred to Kuntha Bopha Hospital in
Phnom Penh, where she died. Samples from the girl tested positive for
avian influenza H5N1 virus at the Pasteur Institute, Phnom Penh.
A field investigation was conducted immediately, with team members
from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, WHO, Pasteur
Institute and FAO. Poultry deaths occurred in this village in
February, but no poultry deaths occurred in the 2 weeks prior to the
girl's onset of symptoms.
Human-to-human transmission as a source of the girl's infection
appears unlikely, as none of her known contacts were sick with
similar symptoms before she became ill. Investigations as to the
source of the girl's infection are continuing.
Samples were collected from 4 close contacts who cared for her at the
village and 9 medical contacts from Kampot and Phnom Penh. All have
tested negative for the H5N1 virus.
The public education campaign in Banteay Meas and neighbouring
districts is continuing. The recent funding from international donors
will be crucial in helping Cambodia control this disease.
