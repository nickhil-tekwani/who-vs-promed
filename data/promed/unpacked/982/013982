The article in Friday's New York Times on Russian research on genetic
manipulation of _Bacillus anthracis_ should be seen in a wider context. The
Obolensk workers have been publishing a number of articles recently in
which they have been arguing for the need for live vaccines, or similarly
behaving constructs, and against the toxin-based vaccines. Their point is
that the latter are too narrowly targeted and would not impact on any
vegetative cell. Seemingly to bring this point home, they had inserted the
cereolysin AB genes from _B.cereus_, which is seldom found in vivo and
cannot normally multiply in vivo, into _B.anthracis_, which thrives
in-vivo. _B.cereus_ hemolysins are extreme instant lethal toxins. Pop the
toxin genes into _B.anthracis_ and you have seemingly a pretty potent thing
which the toxin-based vaccine (being based on anti-PA antibodies) does not
protect against. If you add antibiotic resistance ... Please note that in
the following Russian abstracts, they write about introducing antibiotic
resistance, not inducing it.
The paper by Pomerantsev and colleagues claims that a recombinant version
of STI-1 protected against challenges by the normal _B.anthracis_ as well
as by the experimental recombinant strain; its abstract is attached.
On the veterinary side we have had a successful live vaccine for many
decades. When we looked at the vaccination statistics in Yekaterinberg
covering the 1979 outbreak, it was clear that the Tbilisi version of STI-1
produced side effects, sometimes severe, in a minority of individuals. This
capacity is absent from the published Soviet literature on its vaccine
trials. Subsequently, when we have examined vials of the freeze dried STI-1
vaccine we have found contaminants as we have with vaccines from other
countries.

Bacillus anthracis vaccine strain ensures protection against experimental
hemolytic anthrax infection. Pomerantsev AP, Staritsin NA, Mockov YuV,
Marinin LI. State Research Centre for Applied Microbiology, Obolensk,

The cereolysin AB genes from _Bacillus cereus_ VKM-B164 have been expressed
in _Bacillus anthracis_ strains: virulent H-7 (PXO1, PXO2), vaccine STI-1
(PXO1), 221 (without its own plasmids). Expression was achieved by cloning
the genes in a high copy number plasmid pE194. This construct was
integrated with host genomes in amplified form. Gold hamsters were
vaccinated with parental and recombinant B. anthracis STI-1 and 221 strains
and challenged with virulent ones subcutaneously. Gold hamsters vaccinated
with 221 strains showed, absence of protection. STI-1 immunisation
protected against the H-7 strain, but did not protect against the
recombinant strain. STI-1 recombinant strain protected gold hamsters
against the H-7 as well as the recombinant H-7 strains. The results
describe the modulation of immunopathogenic properties of _B. anthracis_
due to expression of cereolysin AB genes.

It has been shown that anti-anthrax immunity induced by the novel vaccine
proposed has not only anti-toxic, but also anti-spore character. The whole
complex of antigens, namely surface spore antigens, surface antigens of
cell wall and toxin components is required for the induction of strong and
stable immunity against anthrax. The STI-1 vaccine strain with introduced
resistance to several antibiotics seems to be promising for prophylaxis and
treatment of anthrax in case of emergency, especially if antibiotic
pretreatment could be expected. The technology for submerged cultivation of
_Bacillus anthracis_ vaccine strain and for the development of an anthrax
vaccine to be used in human medicine is proposed on the basis of the
conception of the immunogenesis.

The developmental mechanisms of anthrax immunity were studied. Immunization
was found to generally generate specific antibodies and lysozyme.
Collectively, all the factors are responsible for suppressing the
development of spores in the body. This proves the fact that the immunity
is directed not only towards the exotoxin of _B. anthracis_, but it affects
mainly the formation of vegetative cells. On entering the immune body,
vegetative cells may cause _B.anthracis_ infection because antitoxic
antibodies have no effect on encapsulated cells. The findings indicate that
any anti-anthrax vaccine strain must show a complete immunological response
in the body, as well as constitute immunity to all pathogenetic factors of
_B. anthracis_.

Limited proteolysis has established that the protective antigen (PA)
molecule consists of four functional-active domains. So, the shielding
domain borrows an area in the linear structure of the PA molecule with NH2
of the end up to Lys 166 and plays a conducting role in the proteolytic
activation of PA. The associative domain, engaging in the area Arg
167-Met266, plays a key role in the interaction with LF or EF at
self-assembly toxic complexes LT or ET. The stabilizing domain borrows in
the linear structure of the PA molecule are with Gly351 up to Met434. On
the one hand, this area promotes formation with LF conformationally steady
toxic complex's, and, on the other, takes a direct participation in the
formation of a hydrophobic channel by which the molecule LF or EF enters
the target cell. The receptor domain, representing a COOH-terminal area,
starting from Leu663 amino acid, begins to interact with specific receptors
on the macrophages and thus delivers the toxic complex to the target cell.
It has been found that in the molecule of lethal factor there are 3
functionally active domains located in the linear structure of the molecule
as follows: the associative domain borrows an area from Lys39 up to Met242,
stabilizing and effector domains occupy areas from Leu517 to Lys614 and
from that point to Lys COOH-terminal amino acid.
