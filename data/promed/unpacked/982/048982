A 6-month-old Dillsburg-area, Pennsylvania baby, who was bitten by a rat that was to be fed to the family's pet snakes in late December 2014 and died on New Year's Day 2015, was determined to have contracted rat bite fever, according to Cumberland County Coroner Charley Hall [Thu 19 Mar 2015].

The child was taken to the emergency room suffering from a fever and a rash on 30 Dec 2014 and was released after being given medication. On 1 Jan 2015, however, the child, now running a high fever and lethargic, was brought back to the hospital. The baby died in the emergency room that day, the coroner said. An autopsy on the child in early January 2015 determined the cause of death to be meningitis and myocarditis as a result of the bite.

"Rat bite fever" is a general term to describe 2 relatively rare bacterial infections: _Streptobacillus moniliformis_, and _Spirillum minor_. Both bacteria are normal or commensal organisms found in rats and to a lesser extent other rodents and mammals.

After about a week after being exposed, there is an abrupt onset of chills, fever, headache, and muscle pains. With _S. moniliformis_, a rash on the extremities appears after a few days. Arthritic symptoms may also be present. On the other hand, with _S. minor_, an ulcerated lesion at the bite site is typical and symptoms of arthritis are rare. Untreated cases can be fatal in up to 10 percent of cases. Endocarditis, pericarditis, and abscesses of the brain are complications of untreated rat bite fever. These infections are found worldwide, but seen most commonly in Asia and Africa.

The bacteria are found in the oral and nasal secretions of the infected rat. It can also be found in the rat's urine. Transmission to people is most frequently the result of a rat bite; however, direct contact with the rats is not always necessary. People who work or live in rat-infested buildings are also at risk and it has been transmitted through contaminated water and milk.

[Fatalities from rat bite fever [RBF] are uncommon but do occur, as the editorial comment from an MMWR (see below) of fatal infection in adults attests.

This organism is part of the normal oral flora of the rat just as other potential human pathogens such as _Pasteurella multocida_ and _Capnocytophaga canimorsus_ are part of the normal oral flora of cats and dogs respectively. Zoonoses from pets are a fact of life, whether from a rat, an iguana, a turtle, or a dog or cat.

The following is extracted from MMWR 2005; 53(51 & 52): 1198-202 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5351a2.htm) regarding fatalities with rat bite fever in adults:

Although rapidly fatal pediatric cases of RBF have been described previously (2,3), similar mortality among adults has not been reported. Mortality attributed to severe systemic complications (such as, endocarditis, myocarditis, meningitis, pneumonia, or multiple organ failure) has been documented in certain adult patients (1,4). Both patients described in this report [MMWR report above] died within 12 hours of presentation, allowing little opportunity for assessment and treatment. These case reports demonstrate that infection with _S. moniliformis_ can cause fulminant sepsis and death in previously healthy adults. As a result, prevention of severe disease might depend on increasing the awareness of appropriate risk-reduction activities and possible symptoms of RBF among persons who have exposure to rats. Intravenous penicillin is the treatment of choice, and prompt therapy can prevent severe complications (1). Because rapid laboratory confirmation of infection with _S. moniliformis_ might not be possible, clinicians should consider initiating empiric therapy for patients with a compatible clinical presentation and exposure history.

Clinicians should consider RBF in the differential diagnosis for unexplained febrile illness or sepsis in patients reporting rat exposure. Initial symptoms might be nonspecific, but a maculopapular rash and septic arthritis commonly develop (1,5). However, as demonstrated by the cases in this report, patients can have severe disease before the onset of typical symptoms. Despite its name, approximately 30 percent of patients with RBF do not report having been bitten or scratched by a rat (1,5). Risk factors for RBF include handling rats at home and in the workplace (such as, laboratories or pet stores). RBF is rare in the USA, with only a few cases documented each year (1,6,7). However, because RBF is not a nationally notifiable disease, its actual incidence has not been well described.

In the cases described here [MMWR report above], diagnosis of RBF was delayed in part because of the inability to rapidly isolate or identify _Streptobacillus moniliformis_. If infection with _S. moniliformis_ is suspected, specific media and incubation conditions should be used (8) (See Box at source URL above). In the absence of a positive culture, identification of pleomorphic Gram negative bacilli in appropriate specimens might support a preliminary diagnosis (1). In the event of an unexplained death in a person with rat exposure, performing an autopsy might also be critical to identifying an etiology.

Because of the high prevalence of colonization and asymptomatic infection with _S. moniliformis_ among rodents, testing and treatment of rats is not practical. Disease prevention should center on risk reduction among persons with frequent rat exposure. Adherence to simple precautions while handling rats can reduce the risk for RBF and other potential rodent-borne zoonotic infections, wound infections, and injuries. Persons should wear gloves, practice regular hand washing, and avoid hand-to-mouth contact when handling rats or cleaning rat cages (1,9). If bitten by a rat, persons should promptly clean and disinfect the wound, seek medical attention, and report their exposure history. A tetanus toxoid booster should be administered if more than 10 years have lapsed since the last dose (9,10).
