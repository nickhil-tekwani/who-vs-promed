[In general, 3-day malaria [_Plasmodium vivax_] is prevalent in
Kyrgyzstan; it spread after the collapse the of former USSR, which
led to a failure of proper prevention measures against the Anopheles
mosquito, badly maintained irrigation systems in rice fields, and an
increase in migration of populations (seasonal workers, students,
refugees, etc.). Besides that, there are imported cases of tropical
malaria from other regions of Central Asia, especially from
Tajikistan. About 90 000 people migrated to Tajikistan after the
collapse of the USSR from Afghanistan, which is considered an endemic
zone for malaria. - Mod.NP]
