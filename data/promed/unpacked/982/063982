The Department of Public Health (DPH) today [4 Aug 2010] reported
that a 4-year-old horse from Warren has been diagnosed with eastern
equine encephalitis (EEE). EEE [virus] infection was confirmed by the
State Laboratory Institute today [4 Aug 2010]. The horse developed
symptoms on 31 Jul [2010] and had to be euthanized on 1 Aug. The most
recent case of EEE [virus] infection in a horse in Worcester County
occurred in 2003 in Brimfield.

There was one human case of EEE in Massachusetts during 2008;
however, there were 13 cases with 6 deaths from 2004 through 2006.
EEE is usually spread to humans through the bite of an infected
mosquito. EEE is a serious disease in all ages and can even cause death.

"Isolated cases of EEE are always possible outside of the traditional
hotspots where we see outbreaks of human disease," said DPH State
Epidemiologist Dr Alfred DeMaria. "This was an unvaccinated horse
that lived adjacent to a very swampy area. We are hoping that it
serves to remind people that both EEE, and particularly West Nile
virus, can be present throughout Massachusetts during mosquito
season. It is prudent to use bug [mosquito] spray [repellant] and
minimize your exposure to mosquitoes to help reduce your risk, no
matter where you live."

People have an important role to play in protecting themselves and
their loved ones from illnesses caused by mosquitoes.

Be aware of peak mosquito hours. The hours from dusk to dawn are peak
biting times for many mosquitoes. Consider rescheduling outdoor
activities that occur during evening or early morning.

Clothing can help reduce mosquito bites. Wearing long-sleeves, long
pants, and socks when outdoors will help keep mosquitoes away from your skin.

Apply insect repellent when outdoors. Use a repellent with DEET (N,
N-diethyl-m-toluamide), permethrin, picaridin (KBR 3023), oil of
lemon eucalyptus p-methane 3, 8-diol (PMD) or IR3535 according to the
instructions on the product label. DEET products should not be used
on infants under 2 months of age and should be used in concentrations
of 30 percent or less on older children. Oil of lemon eucalyptus
should not be used on children under 3 years of age.

Drain standing water. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water.
Limit the number of places around your home for mosquitoes to breed
by either draining or discarding items that hold water. Check rain
gutters and drains. Empty any unused flowerpots and wading pools, and
change water in birdbaths frequently.

Install or repair screens. Keep mosquitoes outside by having
tightly-fitting screens on all of your windows and doors.

[There have been several equine cases, some early in the transmission
season. It is indeed unfortunate that equine cases of EEE virus
infection are occurring, since there is an effective vaccine
available. Although previous equine EEE virus cases have occurred in
the southeastern, coastal part of the state, it would be prudent for
owners of equine animals to vaccinate, as this case occurred in a
central country.

The 1st case of a human being infected with eastern equine
encephalitis [EEE] [virus] this year [2010] has been found in the
state, John Auerbach, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health
Commissioner, announced at a press conference this afternoon [15 Aug
2010]. A Rhode Island resident in his 20s is in critical condition
after being exposed to the virus, Auerbach said at the press
conference at University of Massachusetts Medical School's Jamaica
Plain campus. The Newport County resident was most likely infected in
one of the southeastern Massachusetts communities designated for
aerial mosquito spraying more than a week ago, Auerbach said.
"Unfortunately," he added, "This gentleman was exposed about a week
before the spraying."

40 percent of those infected with the EEE virus succumb to the
illness, according to Auerbach. "It's a deadly illness and causes
serious injury in those who survive," Auerbach said.

Auerbach advised Massachusetts residents to remain vigilant and to
wear bug-spray and long-sleeves outside, especially around dawn and
dust, when mosquitoes tend to be more prevalent.

[EEE virus transmission is very active in Massachusetts this year
(2010). Some Massachusetts health authorities feared that this year
would be "a bad one for EEE". This concern is turning out to be
justified. Although equine vaccines are available, unfortunately
there is no commercially available EEE virus vaccine available for human use.
