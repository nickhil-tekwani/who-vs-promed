Another 2 horses from the Dundee area [Ohio] have tested positive for West Nile virus, according to the Tuscarawas County Health Department. The agency was notified [on Mon 3 Oct 2016] afternoon about the cases by the Ohio Department of Health.

One of the horses died of the disease. The other was euthanized.

A 3rd horse in the Dundee area was euthanized on 30 Aug 2016 because it had a severe case of West Nile virus. It was the first positive case of West Nile in an Ohio horse to be confirmed this year.

So far, all positive cases in Tuscarawas County [have been in] unvaccinated horses.

West Nile virus is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Horses cannot pass the virus on to other horses or people as they are classified as an "end host". Signs of the virus in horses vary, but can range from flu-like signs to depression and changes in mentality such as drowsiness, lack of control and asymmetrical weakness. Mortality rates from the virus in horses can be as high as 30 to 40 per cent.

However, horses can be vaccinated against West Nile virus, and the vaccination has proven effective in prevention, the health department said.

The Tuscarawas County Health Department will be spraying for mosquitoes in the Dundee area this week [week of 3 Oct 2016]. This will be the 3rd spraying in the area in the past 30 days.

Animal health officials in California and Minnesota have confirmed new cases of West Nile virus (WNV) in horses in those states.

In California, the state Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) reported that an unvaccinated 6 month old quarter horse filly in San Joaquin County tested positive for WNV on [7 Oct 2016]. The filly, which was displaying neurologic signs of disease, is recovering.

The CDFA said 20 horses have tested positive for WNV so far in 2016. The positive horses are located in Calaveras, Fresno, Merced, Riverside, Sacramento, San Diego, San Joaquin, Shasta, Sutter, and Ventura counties. The department said 17 of those were not current on their WNV vaccinations and 2 horses had unknown vaccination status. 7 of the 20 WNV positive horses died or were euthanized.

Meanwhile, in Minnesota, animal health officials confirmed the state's 19th equine WNV case for 2016 in a Benton County horse. "The vaccinated 22 year old quarter horse gelding began showing hind leg incoordination on [16 Aug 2016] and was just recently diagnosed [on 5 Oct 2016] due to persisting clinical signs," a report from the Equine Disease Communication Center said. "The horse continues to show hind leg incoordination when carrying a rider."

West Nile [virus] is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations (twitching); hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 per cent.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

West Nile virus is transmitted through mosquitoes. It is preventable by a vaccine, usually given in combination with the vaccine against eastern equine encephalitis virus, which is also transmitted by mosquitoes.
