[There was a porcine outbreak in Khar'kov last year, also on the eastern border with Russia; see:
6 Apr 2016 Anthrax - Ukraine (02): (KK) human, porcine, OIE 20160406.4142864
31 Mar 2016 Anthrax - Ukraine: (KK) human, porcine 20160331.4131177
I doubt if this is a coincidence. If I were to hypothesize it would be that these pig owners are buying Russian pig feed, which has been related to anthrax outbreaks in the past. The alternative is that a sheep died earlier (of anthrax) and this pig scavenged the carcass or viscera; pigs are useful garbage disposal animals in rural areas.

That 2016 pig was the 1st anthrax outbreak in Ukraine in many years. Otherwise there had been bovine outbreaks in 2012 in Cherkassy and Zaporozhye; a singular outbreak in 2010 in Chemernivis oblast; and 5 outbreaks in 2007, one of which was in Kharkov. It is truly sporadic. - Mod.MHJ
