Ukraine: 2nd victim of rabies in Kirovograd Region
--------------------------------------------------
A 53 year old woman died in the local hospital of Novoukrainckiy district,
Kirovograd region. Earlier, she was admitted to hospital there on suspicion
of having rabies. In September 2005, the woman sought medical attention
after being bitten by a stray animal. The injured woman told physicians
that, on 27 Sep 2005, she had been bitten by a fox-like dog running free in
the streets of the village. Laboratory investigation in the Kirovograd
Infectious Diseases Hospital confirmed the diagnosis of rabies infection in
the patient. <http://www.fraza.com.ua/news/05.12.05/16282.html>
This is the 2nd fatal case of rabies to have been reported in the
Kirovograd region since the beginning of September 2005. At the end of
October 2005, a 64 year old man died after having been bitten by a feral
cat. He also was a resident of the Novoukrainskiy district of the
Kirovograd region. This patient only sought medical attention 10 days
before his death, although he had bitten by the cat in August 2005.
