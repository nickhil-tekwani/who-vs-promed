Presence of tomato yellow leaf curl virus infecting squash (_Cucurbita
pepo_) in Cuba
-----------------------------------------
Y Martinez Zubiaur, D Fonseca, M Quinones, I Palenzuela, National Center
for Animal and Plant Health, Apdo 10 CP 32700, San Jose de las Lajas,
Habana, Cuba. Plant Dis 2004; 88: 572, published online as D-2004-0312-01N,
2004. Accepted for publication 27 Jan 2004.

In a survey conducted in Havana Province during Jan and Feb 2003, symptoms
of curling and light yellowing of leaves were found in squash plants
(_Cucurbita pepo_). DNA from leaves of 6 symptomatic squash plants was
extracted (1) and hybridized at high stringency with specific probes of the
intergenic region of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV, genus
_Begomovirus_) isolated in Cuba by using a non-radioactive hybridization
kit (AlkPhos Direct Labeling and Detection Systems; Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech Inc, Piscataway, NJ).

3 samples were positive in the non-radioactive analyses. The same samples
were positive using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) when the DNA was
analyzed with degenerate primers PAL1v1978/PAR1c715 for DNA-A (5), specific
primers, ORITY1/ORITY2, for the intergenic region (2), and overlapping
specific primers for TYLCV (3). Fragments of 1.4, 0.750, and 2.8 kb were
cloned using pGem-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI), and the 6 clones obtained
were sequenced using the Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit in a SEQ 4 Ã— 4
machine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.).

Sequences of 3 fragments exhibited 95 to 97 per cent homology with TYLCV
(GenBank Accession Nos. AF414089 and AF260331). In addition, we did not
obtain a PCR product when DNA was amplified using degenerate primers
PBV1c800/PBC1v2039 for DNA-B (4). These results suggest that TYLCV is
present in squash in field plantations, and these plants may serve as a
virus reservoir for other crops, such as tomatoes.

[To date, there have been 22 ProMED-Plant reports concerning TYLCV since
1999. The virus causes a devastating disease in the Middle East, Africa,
South East Asia, and in the western hemisphere. Disease losses can be
catastrophic, leading to complete loss. Disease management includes the use
of available resistant cultivars, avoidance of peak times of vector
activity, changes in cultural practices such as the control of
between-season, alternate hosts, as well as the identification of
resistance sources and the production of transgenic plants containing
resistant genes from wild species. For simplicity, I have included only the
1st and last reports, but all of them are available from the ProMED-mail
website.
