Leishmaniasis is still rife in Algeria
--------------------------------------
At the end of 2011, according to a report of hospital services in the
daïra [subdistrict] of Mecheria, some 330 cases of cutaneous
leishmaniasis have been recorded in the subdistrict.

The rate of this disease is still growing, according to our source,
and the majority of [affected] households have been located in the
heart of urban centers, for example Mecheria, where there was
cutaneous leishmaniasis in almost all areas among children.

Several factors, from the same source, are at the origin of this
dangerous zoonosis. Mention is made, for example, of the absence or
inadequacy of appropriate chemical treatment, the degradation of
environmental health and the presence of urban stables favoring
proliferation of the sand fly, the leishmaniasis [vector].

[Leishmaniasis seems to have increased in Algeria over the past
decade. A recent study (Fendri AH et al. Leishmaniasis in Constantine
(Algeria): Review of five years (2006-2010) at the University
Hospital. Bull Soc Pathol Exot. 2011 Dec 23. [Epub ahead of print])
showed that children have the highest risk of both cutaneous and
visceral Leishmaniasis.

Another recent study describe the spread of _L. major_ from the arid
zones towards the semi-arid areas, particularly in the Soummam valley.
All isolates were _L. major_ MON-25, and the reservoir host was the
sand rat (_Psammomys obesus_), for the first time found in the
locality (Boudrissa A et al. Spread of Leishmania major to the north
of Algeria. Bull Soc Pathol Exot. 2011 Dec 14. [Epub ahead of
print]).
_Leishmania infantum_ with its reservoir in dogs is also found in
Algeria (Aït-Oudhia K et al. Canine Leishmania infantum enzymatic
polymorphism: a review including 1023 strains of the Mediterranean
area, with special reference to Algeria. Acta Trop. 2011;118:80-6).
