[With the addition of these newly confirmed MERS-CoV infections and deaths, the total number of cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia is 463 including 126 deaths. Of the 14 newly confirmed MERS-CoV infections, 3 were in individuals initially hospitalized for other co-morbidities for a period of time prior to the onset of MERS-CoV symptoms. Only 2 of the 14 newly confirmed cases were described to have had contact with a previously confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection, and both of these individuals were described as having asymptomatic infections. A recent series of media reports from the Philippines mentioning the death of a Filipina nurse in Saudi Arabia from MERS-CoV raised the query whether this was a previously reported case in a healthcare worker (HCW) or if this was a relatively newly reported case where the HCW profession was not mentioned as a possible exposure.

[2] Lebanon, 1st case: media report (MOH statement) request for information
Date: Thu 8 May 2014
Source: The Daily Star [edited]
http://m.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2014/May-08/255779-first-coronavirus-case-detected-in-lebanon-health-minister.ashx#axzz30vcD59kQ


The 1st case of the Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS] was detected in Lebanon, Health Minister Wael Abu Faour said [Thu 8 May 2014].

"For the sake of transparency toward the Lebanese public, and the responsibility and concern for the safety and health of the Lebanese, this afternoon [8 May 2014] one case was diagnosed with the coronavirus [MERS-CoV], and he is being treated at one of the hospitals," Abu Faour said in a statement.

He said that the Health Ministry monitored the safety measures being taken by the hospital and was following up on the treatment of the disease.

"This has led to significant improvements in the patient's health and he was allowed to leave the hospital," Abu Faour said.

He added that the Health Ministry was also following up on epidemiological investigations and surveillance to ensure the virus does not spread across Lebanon.

Abu Faour called on health institutions and medical and nursing staff to take maximum preventative measures and inform the epidemiological surveillance unit of any suspected cases.

The MERS virus, which causes coughing, fever, and pneumonia, has killed some 117 people in Saudi Arabia since it was detected in September 2012. Cases have also been reported in Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Oman, Tunisia, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and Britain [and Greece and the United States - Mod.MPP].

Abu Faour stressed that there was no need to panic, and called on Lebanese citizens "to take the usual measures for the prevention of respiratory diseases," noting that the cases recorded in some countries, the source being Gulf countries, did not lead to an epidemic.

Earlier, Abu Faour gave an order to activate scanners to detect cases of MERS among travelers arriving at Beirut airport. "All the suspected cases at the hospitals and after conducting the necessary tests show that so far there is no trace of the coronavirus in Lebanon," Abu Faour told reporters after a tour of Rafik Hariri International Airport. He said the scanning devices have been installed at the airport.

Abu Faour has said that Lebanese hospitals are ready to handle patients who have the virus.

[The report above is a bit confusing as the 1st case is announced, yet a later sentence says, "all the suspected cases at the hospitals and after conducting the necessary tests show that so far there is no trace of the coronavirus in Lebanon." There are several other media reports announcing this case as well, and other statements from the MOH earlier stating there are no cases. Clarification from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated, as would be more information on the epidemiologic characteristics of the case, age, gender, travel history, exposures to known MERS-CoV infected individuals, exposure to animals, especially camels and camel products, and laboratory tests.
