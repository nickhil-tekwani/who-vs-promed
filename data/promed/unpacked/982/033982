Deep sunken lesions: an atypical symptom on potato tubers caused by
_Colletotrichum coccodes_ during storage

Louvre, 75001 Paris; I. Glais <iglais@rennes.inra.fr>, INRA-Centre de
Rennes, UMR BiO3P, Domaine de la Motte, BP35327, F-35653 Le Rheu Cedex,

_Colletotrichum coccodes_ [Cc] causes a potato tuber-blemishing disease,
commonly known as black dot. Typical black dot symptoms are
silvery-to-brown patches on the tuber surface, bearing black microsclerotia
(Dillard, 1992). Severe infection can cause tuber shrivelling (Hunger &
McIntyre, 1979).
Furthermore, Mooi (1959) attributed deep lesions observed on infected
tubers stored at -1 deg C to Cc. Similar symptoms have also been
occasionally observed on tubers kept in commercial cold stores under
irregular temperature regimes (Gaucher, 1998).
To our knowledge, these symptoms have never been reproduced in control
inoculation experiments, so the implication of Cc as the sole causal agent
remains unclear.
Deep sunken lesions, similar to those reported by Mooi (1959) and Gaucher
(1998), were obtained on potato tubers from commercial stores, that had
been kept for several weeks at 5-15 deg C, after an artificial inoculation
with Cc. The inoculation was performed by depositing a 10 microliter drop
of a conidial suspension (calibrated at 3 million/ml) of Cc (isolate 91.22g
from the INRA culture collection) on each end of healthy mini-tubers of
potato cv. Charlotte. Water droplets without inoculum were used on control
tubers.
Inoculated tubers were incubated in the dark at 5, 10, and 15 deg C and 100
percent relative humidity (rh). After approximately 10 weeks of incubation,
dark brown, irregular shaped lesions with clear contours were observed.
Five months later, symptoms had extended over the whole tuber surface . Cc
was the only pathogen isolated from these lesions.
The proportion of tubers showing deep lesions was higher at 10 deg C (~ 20
percent), than at 5 or 15 deg C (~ 5 percent). These lesions were never
observed on tubers inoculated in the same way but kept at 20-25 deg C and
100 percent rh. On these tubers only typical black dot symptoms developed.
No lesions or black dot symptoms were observed on control tubers.
These observations demonstrate that Cc alone can cause deep tuber lesions
on potato tubers stored for extended periods at 5-15 deg C.

[Cc is a relatively weak pathogen of potato. The pathogen is soil-borne,
residing in tubers and soil. Disease management is difficult because there
are few available chemical fungicides and little or no resistance in
current potato cultivars. Cultural procedures may offer some degree of
disease control. -Mod.DH]
