It turns out that an American man who was treated in an Edmonton hospital may not have had H7 flu after all [see: ProMED-mail report "Avian influenza, human (98): Canada ex China, H7 20130716.1828022"].

Last week the Public Health Agency of Canada revealed that an American whose plane diverted to Edmonton because he was ill had tested positive for antibodies to an H7 flu virus. The antibody test could not determine which H7 flu virus he'd been infected with, but given that he'd recently travelled in China, the suspicion was he'd been infected with the new avian influenza virus. Public Health Agency officials say confirmatory testing done at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control did not find evidence of H7N9 antibodies. Dr. Judith Bosse, assistant deputy minister for the infectious diseases prevention and control branch, says blood tests designed to detect antibodies to new viruses can be difficult to operate in the early days, when they haven't been validated. "Probably, the initial reaction was what we call a false positive, which is the sad part about serology tests," Bosse said in an interview. "And that's why we have to run multiple (ones), as false positives do exist."

She says in order to make sure a new blood test works well, a laboratory needs to test it against multiple blood samples taken from people who haven't been exposed to the virus and people who were known to have been infected and have recovered. Those latter blood samples are called convalescent sera. Only by running that kind of validation process can a lab be certain their blood test is catching true positive cases and not cross-reacting with antibodies to other viruses. If a test cross-reacts, it could generate a false positive result. Bosse says the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg is still trying to get access to convalescent sera from China to use to validate its blood test. Other countries are in the same boat, she says.

But the U.S. CDC, which has also developed a blood test for H7 antibodies, also uses another type of test, known as micro-neutralization. It is considered "fairly specific," says Bosse. "That's why we're actually ruling out that this is not a conclusive sample," she says, adding the Winnipeg laboratory doesn't use this type of test. Taylor says the Winnipeg lab is re-examining its H7N9 blood test as a result of the event.

I would just like to clarify that this case was under investigation at the time, but the final results have come back negative for H7N9, which were communicated in the following week or so after the 1st announcement was made. Those negative results have been jointly confirmed by both the CDC in the USA and our National Microbiology Laboratory in Canada.

I hope this helps clarify the situation about this case who was not related to H7N9.
