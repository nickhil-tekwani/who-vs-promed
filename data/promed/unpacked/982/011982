[1] Omicron variant patient profile
Date: Sat 4 Dec 2021

There has been a significant rise in new SARS-CoV-2 infections in the Gauteng Province in the last 4 weeks which has been attributed to the new omicron variant announced on [24 Nov 2021]. The first cases of omicron were detected in the Tshwane District and coincided with the sharp rise in new infections, heralding the onset of the 4th wave in Gauteng.

Tshwane has been the global epicentre of the omicron outbreak and the Gauteng province 4th wave with the weekly number of cases rising exponentially over several weeks, reaching just over 8569 cases in epi week 47 [w/e 27 Nov 2021] and 41 921 by [3 Dec 2021] before the end of epi week 48 [w/e 4 Dec 2021]. The exponential rise in cases has continued with 9929 new cases reported in Tshwane in the last 5 days from [29 Nov to 3 Dec 2021] (Figure 1: Daily New SARS-CoV-2 Cases 29 Nov - 3 Dec 2021).

We report on the early experience of the patient profile at the Steve Biko/Tshwane District Hospital Complex in Pretoria, in the heart of the Tshwane District.

In keeping with the statistics presented by the Gauteng Department of Health on [2 Dec 2021] for the province as a whole, and with admissions across all public and private hospitals in Tshwane as shown in the NICD DATCOV database, we have seen a sharp rise in admissions at the Steve Biko Academic and Tshwane District Hospitals (SBAH/TDH) Complex with 166 new admissions between [14 and 29 Nov 2021]. This makes up 45% of all Tshwane District Admissions in the public sector and 26% of all admissions in both public and private sectors for the same period.

It is essential to recognize that the patient information presented here only represents the first 2 weeks of the omicron wave in Tshwane. The clinical profile of admitted patients could change significantly over the next 2 weeks, by which time we can draw conclusions about the severity of disease with greater precision.

Though the NICD has confirmed that almost all cases of SARS-C0V-2 in Tshwane are due to the new variant, we have not been able to establish that in every instance the variant is omicron as the PCR machine in use at the SBAH laboratory does not screen for the S-gene. A reasonable assumption is being made that the cases described here represent infection with the new variant.

The main observation that we have made over the last 2 weeks is that the majority of patients in the COVID wards have not been oxygen dependent. SARS-CoV-2 has been an incidental finding in patients that were admitted to the hospital for another medical, surgical or obstetric reason.

A snapshot of 42 patients in the ward on [2 Dec 2021] reveals that 29 (70%) are not oxygen dependent. These patients are saturating well on room air and do not present with any respiratory symptoms. These are the patients that we would call 'incidental COVID admissions', having had another medical or surgical reason for admission. As many as 13 patients are dependent on supplemental oxygen of which 9 (21%) have a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia based on a combination of symptoms, clinical signs, CXR and inflammatory markers. All are being prescribed steroids as the mainstay of therapy. The remaining 4 patients are on oxygen for other medical reasons (2 previously on home oxygen, 1 in heart failure and 1 with a confirmed diagnosis of Pneumocystis Pneumonia).

This is a picture that has not been seen in previous waves. In the beginning of all 3 previous waves and throughout the course of these waves, there has always only been a sprinkling of patients on room air in the COVID ward and these patients have usually been in the recovery phase waiting for the resolution of a co-morbidity prior to discharge. The COVID ward was recognizable by the majority of patients being on some form of oxygen supplementation with the incessant sound of high flow nasal oxygen machines, or beeping ventilator alarms.

There are only 4 patients in high care and one in the ICU. The numbers of patients in high care on double oxygen, High Flow Nasal Oxygen or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) were noticeably higher in previous waves. This is anecdotal but confirmed by numerous clinicians who have previously worked in the COVID wards in the hospital complex.

Of 38 adults in the COVID wards on [2 Dec 2021], 6 were vaccinated, 24 were unvaccinated and 8 had unknown vaccination status. Of 9 patients with COVID pneumonia 8 are unvaccinated, 1 is a child. Only a single patient on oxygen was fully vaccinated but the reason for the oxygen was Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

An analysis of 166 patients admitted to the SBAH/TDH Complex in the period of [14 -29 Nov 2021], revealed that the age profile differed markedly from the previous 18 months. In the last 2 weeks, no fewer than 80% of admissions were below the age of 50 years. This is in keeping with the age profile of admissions in all public and private hospitals in Tshwane and throughout the Gauteng Province in the last 2 weeks as reported by the NICD and the Gauteng Provincial Government. As many as 19% were children aged 0-9 years and the highest number of admissions was in the age group 30-39 years, making up 28% of the total.

A key question regarding the new omicron outbreak is whether disease severity is similar, milder or more severe than with the other variants, given the large number of omicron mutations.

The best indicator of disease severity is measured by the in-hospital death rate. There were 10 deaths in the SBAH/TDH cohort in the past 2 weeks, making up 6.6% of the 166 admissions. A total of 4 deaths were in adults aged 26 to 36 years, and 5 deaths were in adults over 60. One death was in a child in whom the cause of deaths was unrelated to COVID. There were no COVID related deaths among 34 admissions in the paediatric COVID wards over the last 2 weeks. This compares favorably to the proportion of deaths at the complex over the past 18 months which was 17%. The trend over the next 2 weeks will be clarified as the number of deaths is currently low, and sufficient time will have elapsed for the development of greater severity of disease and the number of deaths might be expected to increase. For now, the death rates over the last 2 weeks as well as over the past 18 months at the SBAH/TDH complex are lower than the overall in-hospital death rate of 23% for the country over all previous waves, as reported by the NICD.

Figure 2 [NEW SARS-CoV-2 Case and COVID-19 Death Rates Gauteng Province; see full publication] shows the absence of any significant increase in in-hospitals deaths in relation to the dramatic rise in the case rate for the Gauteng Province as a whole. This may be due to the usual lag between cases and deaths and the trend will become clearer over the next few weeks.

Other crude indicators of severity of disease include the level of care required in hospital (ICU, high care, general ward), oxygen requirements (nasal prongs, face mask, high flow, non-invasive or invasive ventilation) and length of stay in hospital.

There were only 2 patients in the COVID ICU in the last 14 days, neither of whom had a primary diagnosis of COVID pneumonia. A total of 63 patients were admitted to high care, but our anecdotal information is that the majority of high care admissions were for a diagnosis other than COVID.

In the snapshot Table 1 [see full publication], 3 of the 4 patients in the high care ward had a primary diagnosis of severe COVID pneumonia so it could be that the more recent profile is changing to more severe COVID disease. A more detailed analysis of high care patients is being conducted and may be more revealing.

More precise measures of severity of disease in hospitalized individuals require a review of Chest X-Ray or lung Computer Tomography findings (percent of lung fields showing changes), blood gas measures, blood biomarkers and the concomitant effect of co-morbidities on the patient's condition. Detailed studies of both the crude and more precise measures of disease severity are being done locally by several teams of researchers and the team at Steve Biko is participating in these studies.

A significant early finding in this analysis is the much shorter average length of stay of 2.8 days for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients admitted to the COVID wards over the last 2 weeks compared to an average length of stay of 8.5 days for the past 18 months. The NICD reports a similar shorter length of stay for all hospitals in Tshwane in its weekly report. It is also less than the Gauteng or National average length of stay reported by the NICD in previous waves.

In summary, the first impression on examination of the 166 patients admitted since the omicron variant made an appearance, together with the snapshot of the clinical profile of 42 patients currently in the COVID wards at the SBAH/TDH complex, is that the majority of hospital admissions are for diagnoses unrelated to COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 positivity is an incidental finding in these patients and is largely driven by hospital policy requiring testing of all patients requiring admission to the hospital.

Using the proportion of patients on room air as a marker for incidental COVID admission as opposed to severe COVID (pneumonia), 66% of patients at the SBAH/TDH complex are incidental COVID admissions. This very unusual picture is also occurring at other hospitals in Gauteng. On [3 Dec 2021] Helen Joseph Hospital had 37 patients in the COVID wards of whom 31 were on room air (83%); and the Dr. George Mukhari Academic Hospital had 80 patients of which 14 were on supplemental oxygen and 1 on a ventilator (81% on room air).

The exponential increase in the positivity rate in these patients is a reflection of the rapidly increased case rate for Tshwane but does not appear to be associated with a concomitant increase in the rate of admissions for severe COVID (pneumonia) based on the high proportion of patients not requiring supplemental oxygen.

The relatively low number of COVID-19 pneumonia hospitalizations in the general, high care and ICU wards constitutes a very different picture compared to the beginning of previous waves. A detailed analysis comparing the current picture with previous waves is still being conducted. This may very well be related to the early upswing of the 4th wave, with the more classical pattern becoming evident over the next 2 weeks. What is clear though is that the age profile is different from previous waves. It may be that this is a vaccination effect as 57% of people over the age of 50 have been vaccinated in the province compared to 34% in the 18-to-49-year group.

The high proportion of COVID incidental adult patients and the increased number of SARS-CoV-2 positive admissions among children aged 0-9 may reflect higher rates of community transmission compared to previous waves (variants) that is not translating into higher admission rates for a primary COVID-19 diagnosis. More time is required to fully answer the questions about the severity of COVID-19 caused by the new omicron variant.

[This report is drawn from a low number of cases, so must be considered early data, but cautious optimism suggests a milder disease than was evident with earlier VOC. Furthermore, chest x-rays and lung Computer Tomography findings (percent of lung fields showing changes), blood gas measures, blood biomarkers and the concomitant effect of co-morbidities on the patient's condition still need to be examined. But nonetheless, the profiles of the patients look highly suggestive of a milder illness, possibly because this variant seems to infect a younger age cohort than the earlier variants as a result of vaccination of the older demographic. It is important to get that younger age group vaccinated as soon as possible.

[2] Acquired genomic RNA
Date: Sun 5 Dec 2021
Source: al-Arabiya News [edited]
https://english.alarabiya.net/coronavirus/2021/12/05/Omicron-variant-may-have-picked-up-a-piece-of-common-cold-virus-Researchers


The omicron variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 likely acquired at least one of its mutations by picking up a snippet of genetic material from another virus - possibly one that causes the common cold - present in the same infected cells, according to researchers.

This genetic sequence does not appear in any earlier versions of the coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, but is ubiquitous in many other viruses including those that cause the common cold, and also in the human genome, researchers said.

By inserting this particular snippet into itself, omicron might be making itself look "more human," which would help it evade attack by the human immune system, said Venky Soundararajan of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based data analytics firm nference, who led the study posted on [Thu 2 Dec 2021] on the website OSF Preprints.

This could mean the virus transmits more easily, while only causing mild or asymptomatic disease. Scientists do not yet know whether omicron is more infectious than other variants, whether it causes more severe disease or whether it will overtake delta as the most prevalent variant. It may take several weeks to get answers to these questions.

Cells in the lungs and in the gastrointestinal system can harbor SARS-CoV-2 and common-cold coronaviruses simultaneously, according to earlier studies. Such co-infection sets the scene for viral recombination, a process in which 2 different viruses in the same host cell interact while making copies of themselves, generating new copies that have some genetic material from both "parents."

This new mutation could have first occurred in a person infected with both pathogens when a version of SARS-CoV-2 picked up the genetic sequence from the other virus, Soundararajan and colleagues said in the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed.

The same genetic sequence appears many times in one of the coronaviruses that causes colds in people - known as HCoV-229E - and in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, Soundararajan said.

South Africa, where omicron was first identified, has the world's highest rate of HIV, which weakens the immune system and increases a person's vulnerability to infections with common-cold viruses and other pathogens. In that part of the world, there are many people in whom the recombination that added this ubiquitous set of genes to omicron might have occurred, Soundararajan said.

"We probably missed many generations of recombinations" that occurred over time and that led to the emergence of omicron, Soundararajan added.

More research is needed to confirm the origins of omicron's mutations and their effects on function and transmissibility. There are competing hypotheses that the latest variant might have spent some time evolving in an animal host.

In the meantime, Soundararajan said, the new findings underscore the importance of people getting the currently available COVID-19 vaccines.

"You have to vaccinate to reduce the odds that other people, who are immunocompromised, will encounter the SARS-CoV-2 virus," Soundararajan said.

Abstract
The emergence of a heavily mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant (B.1.1.529, omicron) and it's spread to 6 continents within a week of initial discovery has set off a global public health alarm. Characterizing the mutational profile of omicron is necessary to interpret its shared or distinctive clinical phenotypes with other SARS-CoV-2 variants. We compared the mutations of omicron with prior variants of concern (alpha, beta, gamma, delta), variants of interest (lambda, mu, eta, iota and kappa), and all 1523 SARS-CoV-2 lineages constituting 5.4 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Omicron's spike protein has 26 amino acid mutations (23 substitutions, 2 deletions and one insertion) that are distinct compared to other variants of concern. Whereas the substitution and deletion mutations have appeared in previous SARS-CoV-2 lineages, the insertion mutation (ins214EPE) has not been previously observed in any SARS-CoV-2 lineage other than omicron. The nucleotide sequence encoding for ins214EPE could have been acquired by template switching involving the genomes of other viruses that infect the same host cells as SARS-CoV-2 or the human transcriptome of host cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. For instance, given recent clinical reports of co-infections in COVID-19 patients with seasonal coronaviruses (e.g. HCoV-229E), single cell RNA-sequencing data showing co-expression of the SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E entry receptors (ACE2 and ANPEP) in respiratory and gastrointestinal cells, and HCoV genomes harboring sequences homologous to the nucleotide sequence that encodes ins214EPE, it is plausible that the omicron insertion could have evolved in a co-infected individual. There is a need to understand the function of the omicron insertion and whether human host cells are being exploited by SARS-CoV-2 as an 'evolutionary sandbox' for host-virus and inter-viral genomic interplay.

Discussion
Recombination between SARS CoV 2 lineages in the context of simultaneous coinfection has been observed, with particularly high recombination rates seen in the Spike protein sequence. (22,25) Based on analysis of single cell RNA seq data (Table S2), we see that the receptors of SARS-CoV-2 (ACE2) and HCoV-229E (ANPEP [human cold coronavirus]) are co-expressed in gastrointestinal (e.g. enterocytes) and respiratory tissues (e.g. respiratory ciliated cells). This gives rise to the plausibility of such cells in co-infected individuals being exploited as sites of genomic interplay between different viruses. In addition to co-infection with different coronaviruses, there have been reports of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens including non-SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviridae. (27,28) Even as the production of COVID-19 vaccines is being scaled up, vaccine inequity and vaccine hesitancy have been speculated as contributors to the emergence of Omicron. (31,32) Since achieving global vaccination could take years, it is important to vigilantly monitor the changing mutational landscape that could lead to the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Indeed, even among the omicron variants there are differences in the prevalence of the constituent mutations (Figure S1). Finally, there is a need to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes from individuals with viral co-infections and in general to develop a "variant warning system" for early detection of variants of concern based on their mutational profile. - Mod.LK]

[3] Cook Islands: 1st COVID-19 case
Date: Sat 4 Dec 2021 1:39 PM IST
Source: First Post, Agence France-Presse [edited]
https://www.firstpost.com/world/nearly-two-years-after-covid-19-outbreak-cook-islands-reports-its-first-coronavirus-case-10185391.html


The Cook Islands on [Sat 4 Dec 2021], recorded its first case of COVID-19 since the pandemic began, as the South Pacific country edges toward reopening its borders to tourists.

The nation of around 17 000 people has one of the highest vaccination rates globally, with 96% of the eligible population double-dosed.

The virus was detected in a 10-year-old boy quarantining after arriving on a repatriation flight with his family on [Thu 2 Dec 2021], Prime Minister Mark Brown said in a statement. The boy was believed to have flown in from New Zealand.

"We have been preparing ourselves for the time we reopen our borders. Our testing regimes have shown the value of that preparation by catching this case at the border," Brown said.

The island nation, which shut itself off from the world when the pandemic hit, has announced plans to resume quarantine-free travel with New Zealand on [14 Jan 2022].

A short-lived travel bubble with New Zealand was paused earlier this year [2021] when an outbreak of the virus emerged in Auckland.
