Kaohsiung, a port city in southern Taiwan, on Tuesday [25 Feb 2014] reported the 1st confirmed case of hantavirus hemorrhagic fever in Taiwan this year [2014].

The patient is a 62-year-old man residing in the city's Cianjhen District, Kaohsiung's Department of Health said.

The man, who often travels between Kaohsiung and Pingtung County where he grows fruits, fell ill on 3 Feb [2014] and was later confirmed as being infected with the [a] rodent-borne hantavirus, the department said.

He has recovered since 18 Feb [2014] and his family and workers on his fruit farm have all tested negative for the virus, the [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said in a press release Tuesday [25 Feb 2014].

It said the man developed symptoms of fever and dizziness on 3 Feb [2014] and was admitted to hospital in Kaohsiung on 6 Feb [2014] as the symptoms escalated to include headache, fatigue, diarrhea, stomachache, and abnormal urine. Laboratory tests confirmed on 24 Feb [2014] that the man was infected with hantavirus hemorrhagic fever [with renal syndrome?], which is usually contracted though contact with the urine, saliva, or feces of rodents, the Taiwan CDC said. According to the CDC, a 2010 study conducted in 5 municipalities in Taiwan found that people living or working in traditional and night markets are at high risk of [a] hantavirus infection. Taiwan reported 12 cases of hantavirus hemorrhagic fever between 2001 and 2013, the CDC said.

The latest case has prompted Kaohsiung to launch a rodent eradication campaign, and steps are being taken to trace the source of the virus.

[This case was probably hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), since abnormal urine was mentioned. HFRS occurs sporadically in Taiwan. This report does not indicate which hantavirus is involved in this case. Most likely it is Seoul virus harbored by _Rattus_ spp., as was the case in 2010 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20100415.1221). Since Kaohsiung is a port city, it is probably infested by _Rattus_. People become infected when exposed to virus in excreta (urine, saliva, and feces) of infected rats. It is not necessary to have contact with liquid urine, dust particles contaminated with dried urine may be inhaled.
