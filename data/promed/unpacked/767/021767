Regarding the recent FDA recall, at least 3 reported outbreaks of
botulism have been associated with olives:
1997 - An outbreak (6 cases) of botulism in Gijon, Spain was ascribed
to black olives. One additional case in Belgium was caused by the
same olive shipment.
1998 - An outbreak (18 cases) of type B botulism in Tokyo was
ascribed to bottled olives in brine.
2004 - An outbreak (25 cases, 0 fatal) of botulism was caused by
green olives served at a restaurant in Molise, Italy.
