First Appearance of West Nile Virus in Texas
--------------------------------------------
The first confirmed case of West Nile virus in Texas was discovered in a
dead blue jay in northwest Houston this week and officials warned residents
on Tuesday to take precautions against the potentially deadly
mosquito-borne disease. Health officials have been anticipating the
disease's arrival for months. The first human case occurred in New York in
1999 and spread via migratory birds through dozens of states, infecting 66
people and killing 9.
The infected bird was found last week in a yard near the intersection of
Gessner and Hammerly, approximately one mile from Addicks Reservoir and 4
miles from Bear Creek Park, a popular recreational facility. Local health
and mosquito control departments said on Tue 18 Jun 2002 that tests done at
the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston confirmed the finding
late on Mon 17 Jun 2002. The bird was among a dozen tested recently and the
only one that tested positive so far. Ray Parsons, Harris County's mosquito
control chief, said as many as 4 birds may also have tested positive, but
those results will be confirmed today.
The county has been regularly testing birds and mosquitoes since the
disease began to spread across the country. "We now expect to see West Nile
move around the county," Parsons said at a hastily called news conference
late on Tue 18 Jun 2002. Public health officials here have been worried
about West Nile's arrival since the virus was detected in Louisiana this
spring. Parsons said they expected to start seeing it this summer, but were
surprised by how quickly it spread to Texas. So far, 3 birds and 11 horses
have tested positive in Louisiana. A vaccine to protect horses is now
available. This spring, the Houston Zoo began using the horse vaccine on
its collection of valuable and rare birds, in anticipation of the virus's
arrival.
Kathy Barton, spokeswoman for the city of Houston's Health and Human
Services Department, said the threat to humans is relatively small, about
the same as that for St. Louis encephalitis. She said about 1 percent of
mosquitoes in an affected area carry the virus; of the people who get
bitten, only 1 percent become seriously ill. The _Culex mosquito_, which
bites from dusk until dawn, is the primary carrier of West Nile virus in
this area, she said. People should avoid the outdoors during those hours,
and make sure screen doors and windows fit tightly. Residents should also
rid their yards of standing water where mosquitoes can breed.

West Nile Virus (WNV) Confirmed in Dead Blue Jays in Houston
-------------------------------
West Nile Virus (WNV), a form of "sleeping sickness," was confirmed June 18
in two dead blue jays found in northwest Houston. Veterinarians at the
Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock health
regulatory agency, are urging owners of horses, mules, donkeys and other
equids to ensure that their animals have been vaccinated against not only
West Nile Virus (WNV), but also against Eastern and Western Equine
Encephalitis (EEE) and (WEE), two common forms of "sleeping sickness."
"The introduction of West Nile Virus into Texas isn't surprising, as we
have monitored the south and eastward migration of the disease since it was
first detected in North America in New York in l999. Last year, WNV was
reported in 738 equids in 20 states," commented Dr. Terry Conger, TAHC's
state veterinary epidemiologist. He explained that staff members from the
TAHC and the Texas Department of Health (TDH), which focuses on human
health issues, have worked jointly to share laboratory and surveillance
information and educational materials about this disease which can be
transmitted from infected mosquitoes to humans and equids, causing brain
swelling and severe illness. Until l999, WNV was confined to Africa,
Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.
Dr. Conger said that the cycle of disease for WNV requires two key players:
birds, such as crows, blue jays or hawks, that act as a reservoir for the
virus, and mosquitoes that become capable of transmitting disease after
they take a blood meal from an infected bird. According to the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, there have been no documented
cases of person-to-person, animal-to-person or animal-to-animal
transmission of WNV. "We consider humans and equids to be 'dead-end'
hosts, because they can become ill but haven't been shown to spread infection.
"Late last summer, infected birds were detected in Louisiana and Arkansas,"
said Dr. Conger. "Now with the confirmation of infected birds in our
state, the Texas Department of Health will probably find infected
mosquitoes through their surveillance activities.
"Vaccines are available to protect horses, mules and donkeys against WNV
and other 'sleeping sicknesses,' but the shots are no value if they aren't
given prior to disease exposure," said Dr. Conger. "We are running out of
time before we may see disease transmission, so get your equids vaccinated
now. The vaccines require two doses, administered three to six weeks
apart, and full protection doesn't develop until four to six weeks after
the second dose. Realistically, then, it can seven to 12 weeks for the
horse to develop maximum resistance to infection. That's why it's so
important to start the round of vaccinations now." Dr Conger reminded
equid owners that an annual booster is required for continued protection of
the animals.
"If your horse or other equid has signs of illness, such as staggering or
an inability to rise, call your veterinarian immediately. It also is
extremely important to rule out other causes of sickness with similar
signs, such as rabies," asserted Dr. Conger. "If it is WNV, appropriate
care must be provided quickly. Historically, about 20 percent of infected
equids either died or had to be euthanized due to their illness."
"To help reduce the possibility of WNV transmission, don't give mosquitoes
a place to breed," said Dr. Conger. "Keep only fresh water in birdbaths
and troughs and maintain optimal chlorination in swimming pools. Drain any
flowerpots or other containers that hold stagnant water and keep roof
gutters clean. Control puddles that collect around stables."
Dr. Conger commended the TDH on its WNV disease surveillance, which
includes testing mosquitoes, dead crows, blue jays, hawks and sampling zoo
birds. He said "freshly" dead crows, blue jays or hawks can be submitted
for laboratory examination, by calling the nearest regional Texas
Department of Health office or the Texas Department of Health in Austin at
1-512-458-7255. "Always wear gloves when handling a dead bird, and wash
your hands thoroughly afterward," warned Dr. Conger. "The bird could have
had parasites or other illnesses, and precautions are always advisable when
handling animals that have died of unknown causes."
Dr. Conger reminded livestock owners that, as always, the TAHC operates a
24-hour hotline for taking reports of unusual signs in livestock, including:
1. staggering, falling, or inability to rise
2. illness affecting a large percentage of animals
3. sudden death loss
4. blistering around an animal's lips, teats or hooves
5. unusual ticks or maggots
"We are always on guard, watching for a potential foreign animal disease,
so we ask producers and veterinarians to watch for these signs and report
them immediately to us at 1-800-550-8242," said Dr. Conger. "Immediate
response is our best defense in the case of any dangerous disease."
