During a surveillance study at Veteran Affairs facilities, researchers identified a newly recognized strain of _Clostridioides difficile_ [formerly _Clostridium difficile_] [aka C. diff] that is highly resistant to the antibiotic clindamycin, the CDC reports [1].

In 2012, researchers conducted a surveillance study of C. diff at 2 VA [Veterans Administration] long-term care facilities and their affiliated acute care facilities. They detected a clonal outbreak of C. diff at one of the long-term care facilities and its acute care facility. 15 patients were infected with the strain.

The strain was initially identified as the epidemic strain BI/RT027, which is associated with several healthcare facility outbreaks. But after further testing, researchers identified the strain as restriction endonuclease analysis group DQ, ribotype 5.

Among C. diff infections that developed because of the new strain, 43 percent classified as severe in accordance with Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America guidelines.

The strain is resistant to clindamycin but is susceptible to moxifloxacin, another antibiotic.

_Clostridioides difficile_ (C. diff) ribotype (RT) 027, also known as North American PFGE type 1 or NAP1, is a hypervirulent strain that has been associated with numerous healthcare outbreaks that have increased severity, high relapse rates, and increased mortality. RT027 hyperproduces toxins A and B and has binary toxin CDT. The strain has an 18-bp deletion in the _tcdC_ gene, which is thought to lead to enhanced production of toxins A and B. However, the genes encoding the same or similar toxin profile have also been found in non-RT027 strains, such as the DQ/RT591 strain described in the news report above and the referenced journal article (1). Fluoroquinolones have been associated with outbreaks due to C. diff RT027, which is highly resistant to fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, and variably resistant to clindamycin. The RT591 strain, however, was found to be susceptible to moxifloxacin, but highly resistant to clindamycin.

The following is the abstract that has been extracted from the journal article referenced in the news report above:
Abstract
----------
"During a surveillance study of patients in a long-term care facility and the affiliated acute care hospital in the United States, we identified a _Clostridioides difficile_ strain related to the epidemic PCR ribotype (RT) 027 strain associated with hospital outbreaks of severe disease. 15 patients were infected with this strain, characterized as restriction endonuclease analysis group DQ and RT591. Like RT027, DQ/RT591 contained genes for toxin B and binary toxin CDT and a tcdC gene of identical sequence. Whole-genome sequencing and multilocus sequence typing showed that DQ/RT591 is a member of the same multilocus sequence typing clade 2 as RT027 but in a separate cluster. DQ/RT591 produced a similar cytopathic effect as RT027 but showed delayed toxin production in vitro. DQ/RT591 was susceptible to moxifloxacin but highly resistant to clindamycin. Continued surveillance is warranted for this clindamycin-resistant strain that is related to the fluoroquinolone-resistant epidemic RT027 strain."
