Cases [of meningococcal meningitis] 1st appeared a week ago with an
initial cluster of 7 cases localized in several small towns near
Treviso (Montebelluna, Conegliano Veneto, Pederobba), involving young
adults (age 15-33 years old), most from Latin American countries who
attended a dance party. Of these cases, 3 died (a 15-year-old boy, a
30-year-old African migrant, and a local woman). All, except the
African migrant who died at home, were admitted to an ICU in critical
condition with meningitis and septic shock.
Around 1000 inhabitants of the towns and immediate contacts [of the
patients with meningitis were given] post-exposure antibiotic
prophylaxis and none developed illness.
A 25-year-old male student at Padua University has been hospitalized
in critical condition after developing meningococcal meningitis.
[This student] is from Conegliano Veneto and spent last week-end
[15-16 Dec 2007] in his town. No obvious epidemiological link with
other patients exists.
Laboratory tests conducted at microbiological facility in Padua
(Professor Palu) detected serotype C meningococcus.
Case contacts (roomates, parents, friends, other students and
teachers) received post-exposure prophylaxis with antibiotic.
Ministry of Health dispatched to Veneto at least 50 000 doses of
specific vaccine to be administered to residents in Treviso province
15- to 29-year [of age]. Childhood vaccination is already mandatory
in Veneto for meningococcal meningitis.
Ministry of Health sent communications regarding this outbreak to
European Health authorities and WHO GOARN.

[Meningitis due to the _Neisseria meningitidis_ occurs both
sporadically and as epidemics. There are at least 13 serotypes, based
on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides;
disease due serotypes A, B, C, Y and W-135 are most common. All
serotype polysaccharides but B, are immunogenic in humans.
From a prior ProMED-mail post (20071207.3954): To control an
outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the appropriate
vaccine, depending availability, in every involved district in an
attempt to induce herd immunity (whereby transmission is blocked when
a critical percentage of the population have been vaccinated
(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/>). There are
several different types of meningococcal vaccines. Polysaccharide
vaccines, which have been available for more than 30 years, exist
against serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 in various combinations (e.g.,
a bivalent AC, trivalent ACW-135, and a tetravalent ACYW-135
polysaccharide vaccine). There is a monovalent conjugate vaccine
against serogroup C and a tetravalent against serogroups A, C, Y and
W-135. The conjugate vaccines are immunogenic for children under 2
years of age whereas polysaccharide vaccines are not. All these
vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective with infrequent
and mild side effects. For both the meningococcal conjugate and the
polysaccharide vaccines, approximately 7-10 days are required
following vaccination for development of protective levels of
anti-meningococcal antibodies.
Secondary cases of _N. meningitides_ infection usually occur within
10 days of the primary cases among certain high-risk groups for which
chemoprophylaxis is recommended. These groups include household
contacts, closed populations living with cases in college
dormitories, long-term care institutions, nursery schools, or
military barracks, and close social contacts who are directly exposed
to a case's oral secretions, for example by kissing, sharing eating
utensils, or toothbrushes, in the week prior to onset of illness in
the primary case. Appropriate chemoprophylactic drugs include
rifampin, ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone. The nature of the exposure to
the primary cases of the 1000 inhabitants of the towns near Treviso
who received antibiotic chemoprophylaxis is not specified in the above report.

Montebelluna, Conegliano Veneto, and Pederobba of can be found at

sending information on the 3 fatal cases, mentioning that the 1st
death occurred in an individual from Senegal. - Mod.MPP]
