[1] Kenya, Kajiado county, animal vaccination

Kajiado County government [Tue 10 Jul 2018] embarked on a massive vaccination exercise to curb spread of Rift Valley Fever [RVF] in the County.

County Director of Veterinary Services, Dr. Jackton Achola told KNA that the disease was quickly spreading in the County, hence endangering lives of thousands of livestock, as well as human beings who might end up consuming meat from affected animals.

"Following the heavy downpour that was experienced in the county during the March to May rainy season, there have been reported cases of mortality and abortions in Kajiado South, Kajiado Central and Kajiado West constituencies.

Samples tested positive for RVF in Entonet/Lenkisim ward, as well as sheep and goat plague - Peste dets Petits Ruminants PPR - a highly contagious disease affecting small ruminants tested positive in Ilodokilani ward, Kajiado West constituency," Achola said.

Already, the County government of Kajiado has acquired 60 000 doses of RVF vaccine from the Regional Pastoral Livelihood Resilience Project (RPLRP) and 200 000 doses of PPR (Peste dets Petits Ruminants) vaccine from Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) for use in the County.

The County government has also issued a quarantine notice, covering, Entonet/Lenkisim and Matapato South wards in Kajiado West and Central Sub-counties, to restrict the movement of livestock and its product from the affected areas.

The veterinary department has enhanced livestock disease surveillance, both in affected and the neighboring areas, as well as conducting public health education with all field and abattoir staff, to be more vigilant and enhance surveillance in their areas of jurisdiction.

[2] FAO - Eastern Africa, alert message
Date: Fri 29 Jun 2018
Source: FAO Animal Production & Health Division: RVF Alert for Eastern African Countries [edited]


After a period of abnormal, heavy rainfall and floods in the Eastern African region, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was 1st reported in humans in Kenya; later it was confirmed that the disease was present in animals. These outbreaks are ongoing and pose a threat to the whole Eastern African region. Although, the upcoming season from July onwards will be unsuitable for the vector populations in most of the Eastern African region (except for Ethiopia, South Sudan, and southern Sudan), the potential spread of the disease through animal movements and informal trade routes within and outside of Kenya is likely to occur. Therefore, FAO advises the veterinary services and livestock farmers' communities in the region to remain vigilant to the potential occurrence and spread of RVF in humans and/or animals. In particular, the risk of RVF spread is considered to be very high in Kenya and moderate in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda, and United Republic of Tanzania. In addition, given the current and predicted average precipitation forecasts for the period June-September 2018, southern Sudan and western Ethiopia may be also characterized by suitable environmental conditions for RVF vector amplification.

The outbreak in Kenya is not the 1st RVF re-emergence in the region: during the past 7 months, RVF infections have been reported in Uganda (November 2017) and South Sudan (December 2017). Informal cross-border movement of livestock, conflicts, and lack of veterinary services can facilitate the spread of RVF within the affected countries in East Africa.

[A Map, included in the alert message, presented (a) Predicted RVF risk areas for May 2018, and (b) predicted precipitation anomalies for the period July-September 2018].

In order to prevent and mitigate any occurrence of RVF in the region,
FAO ADVISES COUNTRIES AT RISK TO:
a) Increase awareness of RVF clinical signs among farmers and workers in abattoirs and animal markets through newspapers, radio, mobile phones or other means of communication.
b) Include aspects of occupational and exposure hazards (butchers, slaughter plant personnel, veterinarians and assistants) in communication campaigns and public awareness;
c) Strengthen disease surveillance: active surveillance through serological surveillance of sentinel herds and syndrome surveillance for animals in at-risk areas (especially unusual abortion storms at any stage of pregnancy among small ruminants, camels and cattle). This should include surveillance in markets or places where large numbers are traded or congregate;
d) Advocate the immediate notification of any RVF outbreak to the OIE through the World Animal Health Information System.
e) Best practices for risk reduction:
- Gloves and other appropriate protective clothing should be worn when handling sick animals or their tissues, or when slaughtering animals;
- Fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue should be thoroughly cooked before consumption;
- Protecting against the risk of mosquito bites by using impregnated mosquito nets, personal insect repellent if available, light colored clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers), and by avoiding outdoor activity at peak biting times of the vector species.
f) Promote targeted vaccination by trained personnel of susceptible animals in known at-risk areas
- The use of vaccination as a control option for RVF is aimed at limiting virus circulation in enzootic areas and preventing epidemics in disease free areas and is most effective when used in conjunction with other control strategies, including surveillance, quarantine and movement controls;
- Mass vaccination is one of the tools for preventing RVF epidemics in animals. However, vaccination is not recommended in the event of known or ongoing RVF virus circulation, as inappropriate vaccination can exacerbate the spread of virus transmission.

Note that the FAO remains available to provide support for RVF preparedness/readiness for countries at risk and emergency response for countries facing outbreaks with the aim of protecting public and animal health, saving livelihoods and maintaining food security.

[The above alert message, signed by Dr Juan Lubroth, Chief Veterinary Officer, Animal Health Service, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Rome, was distributed by email to the CVO's in the Eastern Africa countries on [Fri 29 Jun 2018]. This alert message is not available on-line; we are grateful to FAO's Dr Pinto for forwarding this useful document upon ProMED-mail's request. Its actuality is retained.

Since the official confirmation of RVF in the country (on Fri 8 Jun 2018), Kenya officially notified a total of 6 outbreaks in Wajir (n=2), Isiolo (n=2), Tana River (n=1) and Siaya (n=1) counties.

According to a reliable source, the number of Kenya's counties where RVF has been confirmed in animals since the start of the event exceeds the said 4. The most recent follow-up report was submitted to the OIE on [Mon 2 Jul 2018]. A summary with links to the reports and a map is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=26827.

Livestock ring vaccination in the affected areas is on-going. The ban on movement and slaughter of animals from affected and at-risk counties remains in place. - Mod.AS
