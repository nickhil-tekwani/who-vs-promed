State health department spokeswoman Marla Augustine was cited as saying
Tuesday that an _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak that sickened 10 people has been
traced to a restaurant salad bar at the Golden Corral restaurant in
Kearney, 185 miles west of Omaha, and at least eight additional cases may
be linked. The story notes that five people, including a 79-year-old woman
and a 6-year-old boy, were hospitalized, although none was critically ill.
Mike Kutch, president of Tri-Golden Management of Evergreen, Colo., which
owns the restaurant was cited as saying the suspected source was
contaminated lettuce in the salad bar, adding, "Once (the outbreak) was
brought to our attention, we've been cooperating with the health
department. It's a bad thing to happen."
