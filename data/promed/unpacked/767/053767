A government lab worker is suspected of having contracted bovine
tuberculosis (TB) from an infected badger. Around 30 staff at the
Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA) in Gloucestershire are
also being tested for the disease.

The staff are all involved in looking into the spread of bovine TB
for DEFRA (UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs). Dr
Alison Wilson, head of executive support at FERA, confirmed the
health of a member of staff was under investigation. She said: "We
can confirm that a member of staff is being investigated for a
suspected mycobacterial infection. Some of FERA's staff work on
long-term wildlife research projects looking at the relationship
between badgers and cattle in the spread of bovine TB. FERA is
therefore treating the case seriously, as it may represent infection
by _Mycobacterium bovis_, the organism which causes bovine TB." She
also confirmed 30 staff were being tested for the disease.

Dr Wilson said: "This is the 1st instance of suspected bovine TB
among staff at the agency, which has been working in this research
area for more than 30 years. "The risk of contracting the disease
from this type of work remains very low. The risk to the health of
the public remains very low." Last year [2008] a former veterinary
nurse, from Cornwall, and her dog contracted bTB [bovine
tuberculosis] [see ProMED-mail post Bovine tuberculosis, human,
canine - UK: (England) (02) 20080927.3054]. A paper on the case,
published in medical journal Thorax, concluded that the woman could
have been infected by cattle while working as a veterinary nurse or
badgers 'both on her property and as part of her previous work.' The
paper warned of a 'low, but ongoing, public health risk' where bTB is
prevalent in cattle and badgers.

According to DEFRA the number of cases of human infection with bTB
was 'low and stable' and accounted for less than 1 percent of all
confirmed cases of TB in humans.

[_Mycobacterium bovis_ (Mb) is a member of the "_Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_ complex," along with other genetically closely related
species: _ Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (Mtb), the BCG bacillus, _M.
africanum_, _M. caprae_, _M. microti_, and M. canetti. Mtb is the
usual cause of tuberculosis in humans and Mb is the usual cause of
bovine tuberculosis. Although the disease caused by Mb is commonly
called bovine tuberculosis, Mb has a broad host range that includes
humans, cattle, pigs, goats, cats, dogs, badgers, foxes, marsupials,
rabbits, sheep, horses, and deer. BCG is the attenuated bacillus
Calmette-Guerin vaccine strain derived from a virulent Mb strain that
has been used as a vaccine against tuberculosis and increasingly as
cancer immunotherapy. _M. microti_ has been reported to infect small
rodents like voles and more recently also humans. _M. canettii_ and
_M. africanum_ both cause human tuberculosis, mainly in Africa.

Humans are generally infected with Mb by eating or drinking
contaminated, unpasteurized (raw) milk products from areas where Mb
is present in cattle. Mb can also be spread through the air when a
person with the disease in their lungs coughs or sneezes. Mb is
inherently resistant to pyrazinamide (PZA), a drug that is an
essential component of the standard multidrug short-course regimen to
treat human tuberculosis due to drug-susceptible Mtb. Differentiation
of Mb from Mtb is therefore important clinically as well as
epidemiologically. The standard gene probe used in clinical
microbiology labs just identifies the "_M. tuberculosis_ complex". Mb
can be distinguished rapidly from Mtb by spoligotyping (spacer
oligonucleotide typing), which is a polymerase chain reaction-based
amplification of a region of the mycobacterial genome. Other tests,
such as growth in selective media, specific biochemical reactions,
and resistance to pyrazinamide, are more time consuming.

Human infection caused by Mb has been mostly, but not completely,
eradicated in the developed world by the use of pasteurization of
milk and culling of cattle shown positive on skin testing, which was
started in about 1917 in the USA. Mb infection in humans continues to
be reported in the USA, primarily in immigrants who acquired the
infection in their countries of origin where Mb infection remains
endemic, or in persons of Hispanic ethnicity as a consequence of
ingesting dairy foods made from unpasteurized milk of Mb-infected
cows and smuggled across the Mexico-US border (see Levison ME.
_Mycobacterium bovis_: An Underappreciated Pathogen. Curr Infect Dis
Rep 2008, 10:444-446). In the U.K. in recent years, bovine TB in
cattle has been on the rise, a trend that some blame on badgers
spreading the infection.

As stated in the news release above, last year a woman from Cornwall,
England was believed to have developed pulmonary tuberculosis due to
Mb that was acquired either from cattle while working as a veterinary
nurse or from badgers in her garden; her dog was also infected with
Mb [see ProMED-mail post Bovine tuberculosis, human, canine - UK:
(England) (02) 20080927.3054]. To cause her pulmonary tuberculosis,
she would have had to inhale an infectious aerosol of Mb. As stated
in the ProMED moderator's comments at the time, of the 3 possible
sources -- cattle, her dog, or the badgers in her garden -- the
badgers would seem to be the least likely source, unless grass or
soil contaminated by the badgers was aersolized, for example, by
mowing. It is doubtful that she "inhaled" aerosolized urine from
infected badgers after touching grass or soil. It seems she more
likely had exposure to aerosolized respiratory secretions of infected
cattle she may have taken care of or her dog. How the government lab
worker acquired bovine TB from an infected badger is not specified in
the above news release.
