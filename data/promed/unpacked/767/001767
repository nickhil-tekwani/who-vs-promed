Hepaitis C in family groupings:
Since Hepatitis C seems to be most contagious in its early phases, as
evidenced by the large number of uninfected spouses seen in now monogamous
and now drug free survivors of the 1960's, I wonder if there are other
possible means of spread such as tattooing or scarification in the United
Arab Emirates?
