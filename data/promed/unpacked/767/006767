Inhaled budesonide, a corticosteroid often used [in asthma], was tied to a shorter recovery time in COVID-19 patients who were at a higher risk of severe infection, according to a study published in The Lancet yesterday [Tue 10 Aug 2021]. The researchers [studied] UK residents 65 or older or who were 50 and older with comorbidities who were enrolled in the larger PRINCIPLE trial. Patients were unwell with suspected COVID-19 for up to 14 days (median, 6 days), and were randomized to budesonide from 27 Nov 2020 to 31 Mar 2021. In the primary analysis group, 787 received budesonide and usual care, 1069 received usual care, and 974 were part of other treatment groups. None were hospitalized prior to assignment.

The budesonide group self-reported a shorter time to recovery (median, 2.94 days; 11.8 vs 14.7 days). And, although hospital admission and death data were too small for the prespecified superiority threshold, the researchers had enough data to model that budesonide may lead to less hospitalization and death (6.8% vs 8.8% model estimate; odds ratio 0.75).

In a related commentary, Dee Mangin and Michelle Howard note that this link to improved symptom recovery was not seen in the large RECOVERY trial, which enrolled adults with severe COVID-19. They also note that because no placebos were involved, self-reported recovery could be biased.

Overall, they write, "Various subgroup analyses in PRINCIPLE do not provide any pointers to which particular patient or illness characteristics in the included population might be more likely to predict benefit. These trial data do not support use in younger populations who are at lower risk of complications (< 65 years with no comorbidities or anyone < 50 years)."

[Reference Lancet Article: The trial commenced with the primary outcome of COVID-19-related hospital admission or death within 28 days. However, hospital admission rates in the UK were lower than initially expected. Therefore, the trial management group and trial steering committee recommended amending the primary outcome to also include illness duration, which is an important outcome for patients and has substantial economic and social impacts. Therefore this trial has 2 coprimary endpoints measured within 28 days of randomisation: time to first reported recovery defined as the first instance that a participant reports feeling recovered; and hospital admission or death related to COVID-19 (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01744-X/fulltext?rss=yes) .

The authors state "PRINCIPLE is the largest randomised trial thus far to assess inhaled budesonide for community treatment of COVID-19. Our results are consistent with the STOIC phase 2 trial of 146 adults, in which inhaled budesonide reduced COVID-19-related emergency assessments or hospital admissions, compared with usual care, and self-reported recovery favoured budesonide by 1 day. Several randomised trials have shown that systemic corticosteroids reduce mortality among people admitted to hospital with COVID-19, with the RECOVERY trial finding greatest benefit in mechanically ventilated patients, with no benefit or possibly harm in patients admitted to hospital not requiring oxygen.

"This trial has provided evidence of a safe and cheap community treatment for COVID-19 that reduces symptom burden and enhances sustained recovery over 28 days, with a high probability of also reducing the need for hospital admission, albeit just below the prespecified superiority threshold in the primary analysis population. With ongoing, severe COVID-19 surges occurring globally, the need for effective, accessible treatments in the community that can reduce illness duration and prevent overburdening of hospitals and health-care services remains an urgent global priority. Inhaled budesonide is available in many primary care settings and is included in the WHO list of essential medicines". - Mod.UBA]

[2] Post vaccination SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in breast milk
Date: Wed 11 Aug 2021

In line with previous research, 2 studies published today in JAMA Network Open suggested that pregnant women infected with COVID-19 are more likely to have negative outcomes including death, and that vaccine-produced SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are present in breast milk. Both implications help support the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's announcement today that all pregnant people, or those thinking of becoming pregnant, should get vaccinated.

"The vaccines are safe and effective, and it has never been more urgent to increase vaccinations as we face the highly transmissible delta variant (B1617.2) and see severe outcomes from COVID-19 among unvaccinated pregnant people," said CDC director Rochelle Walensky, in a CDC press release.

In the childbirth study, the researchers looked at 869 079 adult women who gave birth from 1 Mar 2020 to 28 Feb 2021, across 499 US medical centers (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2782978). The 2.2% of the cohort who had COVID-19 were more likely to be of non-White descent (43.1% vs 58.7%), but both infected and non-infected women consisted mostly of 18 to 30 year olds (61.7% of the COVID-19 group and 52.6% of the non-COVID-19 group). The commonest comorbidities for the women with COVID-19 were obesity (21.1%), anemia (12.3%), and chronic pulmonary disease (7.7%).

The researchers found that COVID-19 during childbirth was associated with a higher mortality rate (0.1% vs < 0.01%; odds ratio [OR] 15.38), intensive care unit admission (5.2% vs 0.9%; OR 5.84), respiratory intubation and mechanical ventilation (1.5% vs 0.1%; OR 14.33), and preterm birth (16.4% vs 11.5%; p<0.001). Median hospital stay did not differ (2 days), and COVID-19 did not significantly affect the rate of cesarean deliveries (32.3% vs 32.5%).

"To our knowledge, this cohort study is the largest single-database study of women giving birth with COVID-19, and we found that women with COVID had an overall peripartum death rate of 0.1%," the researchers write. "Future research is needed to further understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 during pregnancy and to better characterize the long-term sequelae."

A different team of researchers publishing in JAMA Network Open found increasing levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in women's breast milk after vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2782982). From February [2021] to March [2021], 33 lactating women were vaccinated at an urban hospital in Spain and gave breast milk and serum samples at 2 weeks after the first dose, 2 weeks after the second dose, and finally 4 weeks after the second dose. The women were all 18 years or older, with an average age of 37.4 years (standard deviation [SD] 3.3). Average postpartum time was 17.5 months (SD 10.1).

Analysis showed that the median immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels against the virus' spike protein (S1) for serum-milk pairs for each time point were 519 to 1 arbitrary units per milliliters (AU/mL), then 18 644 to 78 AU/mL, and then 12 478 to 50.4 AU/mL.

"Our results suggest that breast milk from women vaccinated with the novel mRNA-based PfizerBioNTech vaccine contains specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG(S1) antibodies. Furthermore, we found that after the second dose, breast milk IgG(S1) levels increased and were positively associated with corresponding serum levels," the researchers write.

The authors said they believe more research is needed to see if and when these antibodies plateau or wane, how these antibodies actually affect infant health, and if other COVID-19 vaccines produce different results.

[The impact of vaccine-induced increase in maternal antibody levels in breast milk on infant health still remains to be determined, but the protective effect of vaccination during pregnancy and the safety as well as risk versus benefit ratio is quite clear in the light of the growing research data; strong argument to increase vaccination coverage among pregnant women, as the highly transmissible delta variant is spreading globally. - Mod.UBA]
