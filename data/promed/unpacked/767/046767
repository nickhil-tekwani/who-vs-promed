LEISHMANIASIS, CANINE - TEXAS (USA)
===================================
Subject: canine leishmaniasis
I have a question and I'm not sure how to post it on pro-med for
discussion; hence I've chosen this address to send it to first.
I received a call from a Dallas Texas veterinarian who had diagnosed
leishmaniasis in a dog. The dog had lived in Italy with its family
for some period of time before coming to the US. The dog was
presented with the complaint of "fainting". One week prior to the
first veterinary visit, the dog had bleeding ulcerated digital pads
but those lesions had resolved by the time the veterinarian examined
the animal. Diagnostic workup confirmed Leishmania on bone marrow aspirate.
Questions:
1. What are the adverse human health implications of maintaining a
Leishmania positive dog? Of a dog that has undergone treatment?
2. What is the recommended treatment protocol for canines - drugs,
dosages, durations? What are the potential toxicities associated
with treatment? What is the chance for "cure"?
3. What scientific literature would you recommend on this subject?
