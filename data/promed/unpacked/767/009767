Three people who slaughtered and butchered an anthrax-infected cow in
southern Russia have come down with the disease, and one has died, health
officials said. The three people came down with the disease between July 12
and 16 in the village of Uspenskaya, about 1,200 kilometers (about 700
miles) south of Moscow, the health ministry press service reported.
The cow was inspected by a veterinarian before it was slaughtered, but the
disease was not detected. The infected meat was sent to a sausage factory,
and infected sausage was delivered to cities in the region, the ministry
said. The report did not say whether distribution of the infected sausage
had been halted or whether some may have been consumed. Thorough cooking is
believed to kill the anthrax bacteria.

[A major problem with anthrax control in Russia is that far too often it is
dependent on human sentinel cases as in this instance. The three affected
individuals would have come down with cutaneous anthrax, which should carry
a very small to negligible risk of death if promptly treated. Untreated it
has a 10%CFR. The vegetative cells are very sensitive to pH and normally
will not survive cooking & digestion. The real question is the spore
content of these sausages. By going through a sausage factory this cow had
the potential to end up on hundreds of plates and lunch boxes. - Mod.MHJ
