[The following information relates to African swine fever (ASF) in the Philippines, extracted from the above weekly update that covers all affected countries in Asia.]

1. Since the Department of Agriculture confirmed that the 1st ASF outbreak started on [25 Jul 2019], 22 areas in 7 provinces/city on Luzon Island have been affected. So far, approximately 62 000 pigs have been culled. The affected provinces [as of 24 Oct 2019] are Rizal, Bulacan, Pampanga, Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija, Cavite provinces, and Quezon City.

2. Actions taken by the Philippines:
- [As of 16 Sep 2019: https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1080568]:
The Philippines has been implementing its 1-7-10 protocol to manage, contain and control the spread of the disease, i.e., all pigs within 1-km (0.62 mi) radius of infected farms will be culled; limit animal movement and swine farms will be under strict surveillance and testing within a 7-km (4.35 mi) radius; swine farms within a 10-km (6.2 mi) radius will be required to submit a mandatory report on the disease.

- [As of 13 Oct 2019: https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1083042]:
The President and the Cabinet approved additional measures to contain and prevent the spread of ASF in Luzon Island, including lock down of "ASF-infected zones" in Bulacan and Pampanga provinces to ensure movement control of pigs and pork products; [holdings] from which people sell/buy/transport live pigs, [the] slaughter [of] ASF-infected pigs, and [those who sell] ASF-contaminated pork products will be arrested/filed.

- [During the last week, as of 23 Oct 2019: https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1083983]:
Bayambang Municipality, Pangasinan Province: State of calamity has [been] declared in areas affected by ASF in its 7 barangays, including the 4 barangays within the 1-km (0.62 mi) radius from Barangay Apalen, where the ASF was 1st detected.

[A CNN (Philippines) presentation, demonstrating the evolution of ASF in the Philippines since its start on 25 Jul 2019 through 24 Oct 2019, is available at https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2019/9/14/african-swine-fever-timeline.html. Note the time elapsed between the initial cases and the diagnosis and official notification of the disease.

On top of direct contact between infected and susceptible pigs, which is behind most new outbreaks, the virus may be spread by contaminated food that finds its way to animal feed, e.g., as swill. The Philippines authorities are engaged in detecting such possible dissemination of the virus through intranational and international routes. Two recent examples:

1. The Department of Agriculture (DA) confirmed on Thu 24 Oct 2019 that samples taken from locally processed pork products, such as hotdog, longganisa, and tocino, coming from a Manila-based company tested positive for the ASF virus. Further details at https://www.canadianinquirer.net/2019/10/24/da-confirms-confiscated-meat-products-contain-asf-virus/.

2. The authorities have confiscated 2 cargo containers loaded with pork and meat products from China, "misdeclared" as tomato paste and vermicelli. The products are to be tested for ASF. Further details at https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2019/10/26/pork-african-swine-fever-hit-china.html.
