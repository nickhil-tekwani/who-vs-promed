Mustapha Kaloko, the AU Commissioner for Social Affairs, said that the volunteers are epidemiologists, clinicians, public health specialists and communications personnel. He said they would be deployed to Liberia, the country hardest hit by the virus, from 17 Sep 2014.

Kaloko said a 2nd batch of volunteers would be deployed to Sierra Leone in the next few weeks. "This is the time for Africa to show solidarity with the affected countries," he said.

Mr. Xu Zhou, spokesman of the Chinese Embassy, announced in Freetown on Mon 15 Sep 2014 that China will send a China Center for Disease Control (CDC) medical expert team comprising 59 personnel and a mobile laboratory to Sierra Leone on Wed 17 Sep 2014 by chartered airplanes to strengthen Sierra Leone's endeavour to contain EVD.

He indicated that this was a decision made ... upon the request of the Sierra Leonean government... He noted that this is the 3rd batch of China's humanitarian aid to support Sierra Leone in fighting against EVD. Previously, China provided 2 batches of emergency medical materials valued at 11 million RMB Yuan [USD 1.8 million] to Sierra Leone and sent 2 teams of medical experts to the country.

He added that China announced on 12 Sep 2014 a further 200 million Yuan [USD 32.54 million] package of humanitarian aid including food, supplies for disease control, emergency treatment facilities and capital support to African countries and international organizations to help control EVD. In addition, China will also promote long-term medical cooperation with African countries to help them raise their disease control and response abilities and improve public health systems.

Dutch doctors to stay in quarantine over EVD fears
-------------------------------------------
15 Sep 2014: (Dutch News) Two Dutch doctors who have returned to the Netherlands after being exposed to the ebolavirus while working in Sierra Leone are being looked after in a special quarantine unit at Leiden University's teaching hospital. Neither doctor is showing any symptoms of the disease, but they have opted not to return to their homes until they are absolutely certain they have not picked it up. The doctors, who worked for a Dutch charity, are soon to move to another secret location to wait out the maximum incubation period, Dutch media said on Mon [15 Sep 2014].

South Africa ready for EVD threat
---------------------------------
14 Sep 2014: (News24) While neighbouring Mozambique is on a list of 15 countries at risk of animal-to-human transmission of Ebola, South Africa is not. This follows a study by the University of Oxford in England, whose list also includes Nigeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Angola, Togo, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Madagascar and Malawi. "The reason South Africa is not on the Oxford list is because the country is extremely ready. Every port of entry into the country is on high alert. The border officials are equipped to detect anything and everything and deal with it," said national health spokesperson Joe Maila on Fri [12 Sep 2014]. Maila said Mpumalanga, which borders Mozambique, was also ready to deal with any incident. "We have already identified 11 hospitals throughout the country, including Rob Ferreira Hospital [in Mbombela] and have prepared them to deal with any kind of a haemorrhaging fever," Maila said.

[It is excellent that ports and airports are on high alert, but what about hospitals? Remember 1996? See: Ebola - South Africa (10) Archive No. 19961129.1992. The EVD carrier arrived from Gabon with no symptoms, and the hospital didn't know there was an epidemic there. - Mod.JW]

Malaysia to send 20 million rubber gloves to fight EVD
---------------------------------------
15 Sep 2014: (Reuters) Malaysia will send more than 20 million medical rubber gloves to 5 African nations battling the deadly Ebola virus, addressing a crucial shortage faced by overwhelmed health workers, the country's Prime Minister Najib Razak announced on Mon [15 Sep 2014].

The Southeast Asian nation is a leading manufacturer of rubber gloves, producing about 60 percent of the world's supply of latex medical gloves. Health authorities say that a shortage of rubber gloves in affected African nations has led to more deaths and raised risks that the virus will spread among doctors and nurses.

Sierra Leone: impact of lockdown on mining
-----------------------------------
15 Sep 2014: (Reuters) Minerals group Sierra Rutile Ltd said its operations would be restricted during the 3-day countrywide lockdown to halt the spread of Ebola across Sierra Leone and that it would optimize operations in the lead-up to mitigate overall impact of the disruption. The company, which mines rutile in the southwest of Sierra Leone, said export of products to customers would not be affected and that essential services such as the power plant and a health clinic would continue to operate as normal [The main uses for rutile (one of the 5 forms of titanium dioxide found in nature) are the manufacture of refractory ceramic, as a [very white] pigment, and for the production of titanium metal. - Wikipedia]. The West African country will restrict residents to the areas around their homes for 3 days from 19 Sep 2014 in a bid to halt new infections and help health workers track down people suffering from the disease.

[Lockdown "around their homes" is very different from "in their homes." Presumably, many workers live near the mine and will also be able to attend work and the health clinic. - Mod.JW]

Nigeria: Ilorin University to screen returning students for EVD symptoms
---------------------------------------
15 Sep 2014: (Africa 5 News) The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ilorin, Prof. AbduGaniyu Ambali, says all students will be screened for the Ebola virus disease before entering the campus. Ambali stated this on Mon [15 Sep 2014] while unveiling preventive kits worth N1.2 million [USD 7300] at the university's health centre. "The procurement of the anti-EVD kits is part of the university's preparedness to tackle the epidemic headlong," the vice chancellor said. The kits, he said, included face masks, boots, gloves, automatic soap dispensers, infrared thermometers, and disposable bed spreads. ...

Cotonou [Benin] port authorities issue anti-EVD measures
-------------------------------------
Following the outbreak of the Ebola virus [disease] in West Africa, Cotonou port authorities have taken several preventive measures to fight the spread of the virus. For all vessels calling on Cotonou port, Benin, the agent is required to send to the Harbor Master office a port of call list mentioning the last 10 ports of calls 3 days prior to arrival. All vessels arriving from or which have called at a port in one of the countries infected by EVD should have on board prevention equipment (gloves, masks, sanitizing gel, etc.). In addition, all vessels arriving from or which have called at a port in one of the countries infected by EVD, and which have prevention equipment onboard, must stay at anchorage and receive FREE PRATIQUE from port health authorities prior to pilot boarding. (Boat transportation cost for embarkation/disembarkation of port health authorities are on the vessel's account and the same is to be arranged by the agent). It is also mandatory for all crew and anyone boarding such vessels to wear masks and gloves throughout the entire port stay

[This last provision is overkill if it means crew who stay on board and do not disembark are supposed to wear masks and gloves. There is zero danger of airborne transmission from ship to shore. Cotonou is close to Lagos, Nigeria on the West African coast; see map at http://www.beekeeping.com/countries/nigeria_map.jpg.
