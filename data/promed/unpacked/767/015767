The Villa Clara Province Centre for Plant Health reports that currently conditions are favourable for development of fungal diseases. Many farmers are trying to grow several crops per season. This aids the spread of tar spot of maize which can destroy whole fields.

The disease was reported in Cuba for the 1st time in 2014 from the province of Ciego de Avila where it caused heavy crop losses. The outbreak was eventually controlled by the use of fungicides, and this is also urgently recommended to farmers in Villa Clara.

[Tar spot of maize is a disease complex, which has been known to cause serious yield losses of up to 75 per cent in Central and South America. It is caused by the synergistic association of at least 3 fungal species: _Phyllachora maydis_, _Microdochium maydis_ (previously _Monographella maydis_) and _Coniothyrium phyllachorae_.

Of these, _P. maydis_ is usually the 1st to cause leaf lesions. While _M. maydis_ is a common benign saprophyte on leaf surfaces, it becomes highly virulent only in association with _P. maydis_ and forms necrotic rings around the _P. maydis_ lesions. _C. phyllachorae_ may be a hyperparasite of the other 2, but its role is not fully understood yet. Leaf lesions may coalesce causing blight and complete burning of the foliage. In addition, characteristic black, shiny spots ("tar spots") are produced both within lesions and on other leaf areas. The disease reduces photosynthetic potential and therefore plant vigour. Affected ears have fewer kernels which may germinate prematurely on the cob.

_P. maydis_ is an obligate parasite; its spores are spread by wind and with infected plant material, and it produces a potent toxin, killing plant tissue. The disease is favoured by cool, humid conditions. Tar spot management may include fungicide treatments and use of maize varieties with tolerance or low sensitivity to the disease. However, resistance breeding is difficult because of the involvement of multiple pathogens, and little is known about the genetics of tar spot resistance.
