Another patient died in the rare epidemic in Chichiriviche
----------------------------------------------------------
The Governor argues that the situation is controlled and invites
vacationers to visit the area.

Although the Governor of Vargas, Jorge Garcia Carneiro, said
yesterday [3 Apr 2009] that the sanitary cordon [the public health
measures that were implemented to stop the spread of the disease,
such a quarantine, vaccination campaigns, health education campaigns,
etc. - Mod.MPP] applied in response to the epidemic in the town [of
Chichiriviche] will be lifted for Holy Week [known as Semana Santa in
Latin America, the week ending with Easter Sunday], a 3rd patient
died last night [3 Apr 2009]: a 12 year-old-child, who was
hospitalized in the intensive care unit at Perez Carreno [hospital/clinic].

But Garcia Carneiro said "the situation is controlled" and he invited
tourists to come to Chichiriviche de la Costa to enjoy the holiday week.

Fear and uncertainty have taken hold of this rural village of 820
inhabitants, because the etiology of these 3 deaths is still unknown.
This adds another element, which is disturbing the population and it
has to do with the losses [economic] that they will suffer during Holy Week.

"It is impossible for a population that subsists on artisanal fishing
and tourism, not to feel anxiety on not knowing whether we will have
the usual tourists, after 3 children have died and others are
hospitalized because of this strange disease and about which there
are many rumors but nothing confirmed," Carlos Castro, an artisanal
fisherman for 10 years pointed out with concern.

In fact, this unease felt by the tourism service providers in
Chichiriviche, is already being felt by the owners of vacation homes
and those who had made reservations at local inns before the disease
outbreak was discovered [one suspects this is referring to
cancellations at local inns following the press coverage of the
outbreak. - Mod.MPP]

A woman who owns a house in the village, had plans to go there with
her family, but he says that she will seek another site, "not to take risks."

While another 45 children and 2 adults have had the same symptoms of
the 3 children who died since the 5th day, (vomiting, stomach and
general upset, and fever), it was only last Saturday [28 Mar 2009]
that the health authorities became involved.

They presume that [the outbreak is one of] Chagas disease transmitted
through eating food infected with feces from the chipo [local name
for _Triatoma infestans_, in English "kissing bug"]. This is a
hypothesis, as there is complete silence at the official level. It is
has been unofficially said that the 35 hospitalized patients (11 in
the Social Security hospital of La Guaira, 16 in the Periferico de
Pariata, 2 in the Perez Carreno, and 6 in the Clinical Hospital), are
responding to the treatment for Chagas disease.

It was learned that investigators have been sent to the village.

[According to the newswire above, there has been another fatality
attributable to the as yet not officially diagnosed outbreak in
Chichiriviche, Venezuela. The total number of affected individuals
has not changed since the 1st ProMED-mail report (see Undiagnosed
fatalities - Venezuela: (Vargas), Chagas, susp, RFI 20090402.1279).
It appears as though trypanosomiasis through oral ingestion is still
the prevailing diagnosis although confirmation of this diagnosis is
still pending. Other possible diagnoses such as leptospirosis have
not been mentioned in the press, and this moderator has not been able
to find any official information on the Ministry of Health website to
further clarify the situation.

ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information on this
outbreak along with results of ongoing investigations.

Chichiriviche is one of the beaches in Vargas state. The state used
to be one of the municipalities of the Federal District, several
kilometers from the capital of Caracas. For the interactive
HealthMap/ProMED map of Venezuela, see <http://healthmap.org/r/008s>.
