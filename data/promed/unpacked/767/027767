Seasonal flu may hit Europe after H1N1
--------------------------------------
The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus could kill up to 40 000 people
across Europe and be followed by seasonal flu waves that could kill the
same number, European health experts said on Friday [6 Nov 2009]. The
Sweden-based European Center for Disease Prevention and Control [ECDC] said
epidemics of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection, known as swine flu, were
now affecting almost all countries in the European Union but it could not
predict how intense the peaks would be. What was certain, it said, was that
the pandemic would continue to kill thousands and put many patients into
intensive care as the northern hemisphere's winter sets in.

"All European countries will be affected, and this will put considerable
stress on health care systems," said ECDC director Zsuzsanna Jakab.

ECDC, which monitors disease in the European Union and European free trade
area (EFTA), said it was hard to predict what the mix of pandemic and
seasonal flu viruses would bring but there was a risk of seasonal flu
epidemics "early in 2010 when the pandemic waves have passed." Angus
Nicoll, the ECDC's flu coordinator, said in non-pandemic situations,
seasonal flu could kill up to 40 000 people in Europe -- and [pandemic]
H1N1 could do the same. "That is not a trivial number," he said. "And the
fact that [pandemic] H1N1 is happening in younger adults, pregnant women
and people without risk factors ... makes it feel different."

ECDC said experience from the United States and the southern hemisphere
showed pregnant women with the virus are 10 times more likely to need
intensive care than those with no risk factors. Those with asthma and
chronic respiratory diseases have 3 times the risk and the very obese 6
times the risk. But it also said evidence so far shows some 20 to 30 per
cent of [pandemic] H1N1 deaths are among healthy young people.

ECDC's latest daily update said all 27 EU and 4 EFTA countries have cases
of H1N1 pandemic flu and there have been 389 deaths linked to [pandemic]
H1N1 in the region since April [2009], including 154 in Britain, 73 in
Spain, 25 in Italy, and 22 in France. ECDC's global toll showed 6005 fatal
cases of [pandemic] H1N1 have been reported. WHO, which updates its figures
weekly, said on Thursday that 5712 people have died worldwide since
[pandemic] H1N1 was discovered earlier this year. ECDC said the numbers of
fatal cases associated with pandemic flu were "likely to be gross
underestimates" as access to health care and lab tests varied from country
to country.

GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi-Aventis are among some 25 companies making
pandemic vaccines, while other drugmakers including Roche are making
antiviral therapies for use as frontline H1N1 treatment. Nicoll said
vaccination programs which started in some European countries in recent
weeks were vital to protecting those most at risk but had come too late to
halt the disease. "We're not trying at this stage to protect the whole of
society with the vaccines. The strategy is to protect the vulnerable."

European Union experts say some countries "ambushed" by H1N1
------------------------------------------------------------
Some countries have been "ambushed" by sudden severe outbreaks of disease
and death from the H1N1 flu pandemic, and have gone over the top in their
response, a European flu specialist said on Friday [6 Nov 2009]. Angus
Nicoll, influenza coordinator at ECDC said the apparent sudden surge of
disease in Ukraine, which has reported at least 86 deaths from flu-like
illness, was a feature of [pandemic] H1N1 -- which is mild in most people
and can spread undetected for weeks. "The mildness is good in some ways,
but it has also given the disease control people some problems," Nicoll said.

"Then you get a Ukraine thing, where some countries have suddenly been
ambushed by the pandemic and have gone over the top in their response."
Ukraine closed schools, banned public meetings including election rallies
and restricted travel for 3 weeks from 30 Oct 2009 after it confirmed its
1st H1N1 death. "The best bet is that this is actually a country that is 6
weeks into its pandemic," Nicoll told reporters at a briefing. "They just
didn't notice it officially until young people started getting ill and
going into hospital." The epidemic coincides with the start of campaigning
for a presidential election on 17 Jan 2009 and Prime Minister Yulia
Tymoshenko, who announced the measures and is a front-runner in the
election, said the outbreak would affect campaign rallies.

A team of experts from the Stockholm-based ECDC and the World Health
Organization in Geneva has gone to Ukraine at the request of its health
ministry and are currently working in Kiev and Lviv, ECDC said in an update
on the outbreak. It said it was "clear that pandemic H1N1.. has established
itself in Ukraine" and it was likely that most of the rapidly spreading
cases of respiratory disease were related to [?] H1N1 flu.

Bitter political rivals in Ukraine are seeking to blame each other for poor
handling of the [pandemic] H1N1 flu outbreak as the election approaches.
Nicoll said it was a "very complicated political situation" but said some
of the steps taken to try to halt the spread of the disease were "very
sensible." "They have reinforced hygiene, they have rapidly imported
anti-virals, and...closing schools may have been a sensible thing to do."
He said it was the relative mildness in most people who catch [pandemic]
H1N1 flu, which the WHO declared a pandemic in June [2009] and which has
killed more than 5700 people around the world, was one of the reasons
Ukraine had apparently taken by surprise. The virus is "not a big deal" for
most people who get it, he said, while for others it is "very severe."

Pandemic H1N1 outbreak, Ukraine
-------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has reported yesterday [5 Nov 2009] 633 877 cases of
acute respiratory illness and 95 deaths related to acute respiratory
illness, which represents a significant increase compared to the previous
day (+32 per cent for the number of cases and + 10 per cent for the number
of deaths). Influenza A [pandemic] (H1N1) has been identified in a number
of samples in domestic laboratories and confirmed by the WHO1s reference
laboratory in London. A 9-person WHO outbreak assessment team, including
experts from ECDC and EU Member States has been deployed at the request of
the ministry of health in Ukraine and are presently in Kiev and Lviv.

It is clear that the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 [virus] has established itself in
Ukraine and it is likely that the rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine is
mainly related to the pandemic. However, at this stage, others causes for
clusters of respiratory illness, specifically in the western oblasts cannot
be ruled out.

Ukraine called on the EU [European Union] through the Community Civil
Protection Mechanism on 31 Oct 2009 for help to deal with this situation.
The European Commission's Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC), is today
dispatching a coordination and assessment team of experts. Adding to that,
several countries has already offered their help to control this outbreak.

Cumulative number of reported acute respiratory illness [ARI]cases in
Ukraine, by day, since 29 Oct 2009 (data MoH):
Date / ARI / Hospitalisations / Deaths
29 Oct / 37 923 / 951 / 30
