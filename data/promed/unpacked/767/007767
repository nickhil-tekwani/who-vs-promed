Animal health workers have killed 3460 chickens at a farm in the southern Mekong Delta province of Bac Lieu [Viet Nam], after tests confirmed the birds have been infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus, the Thanh Nien (Young People) newspaper reports.

They also sprayed to clean up the farm and made random tests on birds in the province to see if the virus was spreading, the newspaper reported.

[The media-derived outbreak reported in item [1] above and the one reported to the OIE in item [2] are situated at a very large distance from each other; confirmation or otherwise of the outbreak in Bac Lieu, in the extreme south of Viet Nam, is requested.

Viet Nam is known to be infected by HPAI H5N1 since 2003. Its last major epizootic reportedly started on 12 Dec 2006; 360 outbreaks, covered in 78 follow-up reports, were sent to the OIE throughout the years 2007-2012. The final follow-up report (no 78) was submitted on 24 Dec 2012, declaring the disease resolved as of 7 Nov 2012. No additional immediate notifications have been submitted prior to the current one.

In Viet Nam's semi-annual OIE report for 2013 (January-June), HPAI appears among the diseases present in the country. The data provided, related to the said period, are 22 new outbreaks in domestic fowl (poultry) and 2 in wild birds. Among 157 267 susceptible domestic fowl, there were a total of 33 534 cases, 8057 deaths, and 86 922 birds were destroyed.

In September 2012, the Vietnamese noted the spread in the north of a new, extremely pathogenic strain of the H5N1 virus, suspected to have originated in China (see ProMED-mail posts 20120908.1286497, 20120910.1288966, and 20120920.1300398).

Since 2003, Viet Nam has suffered 125 human cases of H5N1, of which 62 died. Most of the cases occurred during 2004/5. During 2013, 2 human cases have been recorded of which one was fatal. - Mod.AS
