CJD-BSE CONNECTION? - UK (5)
============================
I have been intrigued with the ongoing debate and attention BSE has
attracted in the U.K. The press release describing the possible
connection between man with CJD and BSE in York will undoubtedly
fuel the fire. However, I was not aware of a "urine test" apparently
developed by Dr. Narang to aid in the diagnosis of CJD. Can anyone
provide any information or references to this test?
