High prevalence of leishmaniasis in dogs in Spain
-----------------------------------------------
According to the results of a survey involving approximately 100
veterinarians working throughout Spain, one out of every 10 dogs in Madrid
and Cataluna has leishmaniasis.
Intervet -- a laboratory that manufactures dog collars designed to prevent
the disease -- conducted the survey. The results of the survey also
indicate that 95 percent of pet owners in Spain have no knowledge of
leishmaniasis, also known as "mosquito disease," which is transmitted by
the sand fly vector _Phlebotomus_ sp.
Leishmaniasis has 2 clinical variants: a cutaneous form, which results in
serious skin lesions, and a visceral form that affects organs such as the
kidneys and liver. According to the estimates of Intervet, between 5 and 10
percent of the canine population, in areas where sand flies are present,
are infected. These estimates, which are included in the report issued by
Intervet, indicate infection rates of 9.3 percent in Cataluna, 8 percent in
Madrid, 9.1 percent in Murcia, 5 percent in Castilla-La Mancha, 6 percent
in the Balearic Islands, and 4.4 percent in Navarre. Also, according to the
survey, Spanish veterinarians place canine leishmaniasis among the 3 most
commonly seen animal diseases in their practices, the other 2 being scabies
and ehrlichiosis. In 2003, 72 percent of the clinics that treat canine
leishmaniasis diagnosed between one and 15 cases. 20 percent of the clinics
treated between 15 and 50 cases, and 8 percent of the clinics examined more
than 50 cases.

[It is well known that dogs are the main reservoir of leishmania in Spain,
but new data on the prevalence of the disease is scarce. No current data
exists on the prevalence of the disease in humans, but, a recent
presentation on diagnosed leishmania cases at the Hispanic-American
Congress on Pathology from the University Hospital in Madrid reported 118
patients between 1986 and 2002:

that transmission may not be very efficient or that a proportion of
infected humans never develop clinical disease. Mod. -EP]
[ProMED-mail would like to note that the data cited on the prevalence of
leishmaniasis in dogs in Spain was supported by a company that produces a
product aimed at reduction of disease incidence. - Mod.MPP]
