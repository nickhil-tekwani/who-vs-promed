Experts claim that the outbreak of yellow fever currently affecting Sudan is the worst the world has experienced in the past 20 years.

The disease has already claimed the lives of 168 people, while 800 suspected cases of the mosquito-spread disease have been reported across Darfur, since the outbreak began in October [2012]. Many more cases are likely not being reported to health authorities. The official death toll has currently surpassed that of a 2005 yellow fever outbreak in Sudan's South Kordofan region, which led to 163 deaths from 604 cases over a period of 5 months.

Yellow fever is caused by a mosquito-borne virus endemic in tropical regions of Africa and South America. In its extreme form, it causes jaundice with liver and kidney failure as well as systemic bleeding. Yellow fever often reaches epidemic proportions and results in high death rates.

The current outbreak in Sudan could be linked to heavy rains and flooding in the region, which facilitated mosquito breeding this year [2012]. Moreover, prior to the recent outbreak, Darfur's routine vaccination programs had never included vaccinations against the yellow fever virus, [lack of which] which could have facilitated its rapid and extensive spread.

The disease's occurrence has followed nomadic migration routes across Darfur and has affected mainly rural areas, although there is a risk of it spreading to urban areas as well as the camps for internally displaced people, which house over 2 million people forced to flee their homes due to the conflict in Darfur. While a vaccine can prevent infection, there is no specific drug treatment for infected individuals.

Darfur launched a national immunization campaign in November 2012 to cover 2.2 million people, which ended on 7 Dec [2012]. The 2nd phase this month was launched on 15 Dec [2012] and it aims to reach an additional 1.2 million people at risk.

In organizing its national vaccination campaign, the Sudanese government has received the support of the international community, mainly through the World Health Organization (WHO). 1.3 million doses of yellow fever vaccine for the 2nd phase of the campaign were mobilized through the support of the Government of Sweden. On 18 Dec [2012], the UK announced that it would provide [USD] 2.9 million to support the vaccination of 2 million in Darfur.

The yellow fever outbreak has affected 34 localities in Central, North, South, East abd West Darfur.

In reporting the updated regional situation and the vaccination campaign's results thus far, West Darfur's health minister claims that yellow fever has ended in his state.

In turn, Central Darfur's health officials explained that new cases had been registered, but that the patients all came from a gold mining area in Northern Darfur and that Central Darfur had not recorded any new locally-generated cases in over 2 weeks.

The health minister of South Darfur announced the initiation of a 3rd phase of the vaccination campaign in the state, after the 2nd phase ended on 27 Dec [2012] and covered over 70 percent of the population.

[The international community's response to this serious yellow fever outbreak is encouraging. Several non-governmental organizations have provided personnel to help the Ministry of Health's vaccination and treatment efforts on the ground. Other countries have provided vaccine or funds to purchase it, as noted in the report above.

Serious armed conflict is occurring in parts of Darfur that undoubtedly interferes with the vaccination campaign and is likely to displace even more people. Should displaced people be viremic when they move, there is risk of disseminating the outbreak. Active surveillance for case finding followed by rapid response by vaccination teams will be essential to bring this outbreak to a halt.
