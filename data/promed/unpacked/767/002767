Louisiana: 3 alligator farms have West Nile virus infected animals
------------------------------------------------------------------
The 8 inch [20 cm] alligators, the yellow stripes of babyhood still bright
on their bodies, swam in circles. Their heads were tilted, their bodies
trembling. Then they died. Hundreds of hatchlings on 3 farms are the first
Louisiana alligators known to have been infected with West Nile virus,
identified a year ago in farm-raised alligators in Florida.
The mosquitoborne virus killed anything from 10 per cent to half of the
hatchlings in a given building on 3 Louisiana alligator farms -- probably
more than 700 in all, said Javier Nevarez of the International Aquatic and
Terrestrial Conservation Medicine and Biotelemetrics Research Lab at LSU
Veterinary School. He said he is waiting for test results on hatchlings
from one or 2 other farms. A few of the alligators were about 14 months
old, but most were only 1 or 2 months old, said Noel Kinler, alligator
program manager for the state Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.
Alligators usually hatch in August. The first symptoms of brain damage
showed up in mid-September, Nevares said. Alligator farms in Georgia and
Florida had infections last year, Meyer said.
Alligators are among at least 245 kinds of birds and other animals in which
the virus has been found, according to the National Wildlife Health
Center's Web site. It lists only one other reptile, a black and yellow
lizard called the crocodile monitor. Mosquitoes can bite alligators' soft
eyelids, tongues, and mouths. The virus can then spread through water in
their holding tanks, University of Florida reptile expert Elliot Jacobson
said in August.
The Louisiana alligators were only a small fraction of all hatchlings at
any of the 3 farms where West Nile virus infection has been confirmed,
Kinler said. He said each hatched 3000 to 10 000 eggs this year. Since
people cannot get West Nile from alligators or from eating properly cooked
alligator meat -- the heat of cooking destroys the virus -- the alligator
infection is not a public health threat, Meyer said.
It also does not appear to be a major threat to alligator farmers, though
they should work to control mosquitoes, Kinler said. The 30 most active
farmers keep a total of about 500 000 alligators, he said. "We're urging
them to contact their local mosquito control agencies ... have them come
out and spray." He said some farmers have bought their own spraying
equipment, and many are using "mosquito dunks" to kill larvae in standing
water.
Each farm where alligators have died from West Nile virus infection
reported that the deaths occurred over 2 to 3 weeks, and they have not had
any since, Kinler said. It is even less of a threat in the wild, because
alligators generally cluster in groups only as babies.

United States: West Nile virus activity; Thu 30 Oct to Wed 5 Nov 2003
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This report summarizes West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance data reported to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through ArboNET as of
3 a.m., Mountain Standard Time, Wed 5 Nov 2003.
Weekly update
-------------
During the reporting week of Thu 30 Oct to Wed 5 Nov 20035, a total of 502
human cases of WNV infection were reported from 24 states (Alabama,
Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming), including 16 fatal cases
from 6 states (Colorado, Missouri, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, South Dakota,
and Texas). During the same period, WNV infections were reported in 293
dead birds, 473 mosquito pools, 520 horses, 5 dogs, 3 squirrels, and 6
unidentified animal species.
Cumulative totals -- humans
---------------------------
During 2003, a total of 8219 human cases of WNV infection have been
reported from Colorado (2477), Nebraska (1594), South Dakota (972), Texas
(513), North Dakota (422), Wyoming (339), Montana (220), Pennsylvania
(212), New Mexico (199), Minnesota (144), Iowa (143), Ohio (104), Kansas
(86), Louisiana (84), Oklahoma (75), New York (67), Mississippi (62),
Missouri (59), Illinois (50), Maryland (47), Georgia (36), Alabama (33),
Florida (32), Indiana (30), New Jersey (28), North Carolina (24), Tennessee
(22), Arkansas (21), Virginia (21), Massachusetts (16), Kentucky (14),

(6), Arizona (3), District of Columbia (3), New Hampshire (3), Vermont (3),
West Virginia (3), California (2), Nevada (2), South Carolina (1), and Utah
(1).
Of 8087 (98 per cent) cases for which demographic data were available, 4253
(53 per cent) occurred among males; the median age was 47 years (range: 1
month to 99 years), and the dates of illness onset ranged from 28 Mar to 22
Oct 2003. Of the 8087 cases, 182 fatal cases were reported from Colorado
(45), Texas (26), Nebraska (21), South Dakota (13), New York (8), Wyoming
(8), Pennsylvania (7), Maryland (5), Missouri (5), Georgia (4), Iowa (4),

Ohio (3), Indiana (2), Montana (2), New Jersey (2), Delaware (1), Illinois
(1), Kentucky (1), Louisiana (1), Michigan (1), Mississippi (1), Tennessee
(1), and Virginia (1).
Cumulative totals -- blood donors
---------------------------------
A total of 713 presumptive West Nile viremic blood donors have been
reported to ArboNET, including 621 (87 per cent) from the following 9
western and midwestern states: Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico,
North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. Of the 583 donors
for whom data were reported completely, 6 (1 per cent) subsequently had
neuroinvasive disease (median age: 45 years; range: 28 to 76 years), and 89
(15 per cent) had West Nile fever.
Cumulative totals -- animals
----------------------------
In addition, 11 076 dead birds with WNV infection have been reported from
42 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City. WNV infections also
have been reported from 41 states in horses (3991), dogs (21), squirrels
(17), and unidentified animal species (31).
Cumulative totals -- sentinel chickens and horses
-------------------------------------------------
During 2003, WNV seroconversions have been reported in 1377 sentinel
chicken flocks from 15 states. Of the 61 seropositive sentinel horses
reported, Illinois reported 43, West Virginia reported 8, Minnesota
reported 7, and South Dakota reported 3. In addition, seropositivity was
reported from one other unidentified animal species.
Cumulative totals -- mosquito pools
-----------------------------------
A total of 7590 WNV positive mosquito pools have been reported from 38
states, the District of Columbia, and New York City.
Additional information about WNV activity is available from CDC at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm> and

[As of Wed 5 Nov 2003, in the USA only 4 states -- Hawaii, Alaska, Nevada,
and Oregon -- have remained entirely free of West Nile virus infection of
any animal species (apart from travel-related human cases) since the
appearance of the virus in North America.
The weekly counts of new human cases during the past 10 weeks have been
414, 1046, 1214, 690, 1034, 646, 450, 429, 332, and now 502. (My prediction
that the outbreak may be on the wane now seems premature).
The 3 western/midwestern states of Colorado, Nebraska, and South Dakota,
together with the state of Texas, have accounted for 68 per cent
(5556/8219) of the total number of confirmed human cases, and 58 per cent
(105/182) of fatalities during 2003. - Mod.CP]
