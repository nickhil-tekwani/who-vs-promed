Lusaka - The Central Board of Health (CBH) has ordered non-medical staff to
stop issuing statements on the cholera outbreak which has now spread to
Nyimba district in the Eastern Province.
Reacting to media reports quoting district council spokespersons, CBH
spokesman Dr. Ben Chirwa said wrong figures of new cholera cases and deaths
were being issued by the officials without the approval of the medical
experts involved in the fight against the epidemic. "Such statements are
misleading as they do not distinguish between genuine cholera and diarrhoea
cases occurring in the local communities," Dr. Chirwa said. He said the
board was worried that all deaths occurring in the communities were being
considered as cholera cases.
Dr. Chirwa said all cholera centres in the country were recording a decline
in the number of cases. According to Dr. Chirwa, the certified number of
people who have died from cholera was 45 while the rest died from either
diarrhoea or HIV and AIDS related diseases.

The World Health Organization has been informed by several Ministries of
Health in countries of eastern and southern Africa of an increase in
cholera cases and deaths. The situation in eastern Africa is similar to
that at the end of 1997 when almost all countries in the Horn of Africa
were affected by severe cholera outbreaks or threatened by them. Most of
the countries then affected continued to report cases of cholera to WHO
throughout 1998. However, sudden increases in cases and deaths are now
being reported in the same countries as well as countries in southern
Africa.
Countries recently reporting new or increased cholera activity are: Kenya,
Mozambique, Somalia, & Uganda
