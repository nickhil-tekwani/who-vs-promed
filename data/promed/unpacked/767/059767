Iran: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever update: 1 Jan to 31 Dec 2005
---------------------------------------------
The following is the latest updated report on Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever (CCHF) in Iran, from the Arboviruses and Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers
Laboratory (National Center) of the Pasteur Institute of Iran, in Tehran,
for the period 1 Jan to 31 Dec 2005. This supplements our last report
submitted to ProMED-mail on 6 Sep 2005 and posted as "Crimean-Congo
Hemorrhagic Fever, 2005 - Iran 20050907.2647".
From 1 Jan to 31 Dec 2005, the total number of suspected cases of CCHF was
84. Among the 84 suspected cases from different provinces of Iran, we found
11 IgM positive, RT-PCR positive cases (one fatality), 2 IgM positive,
RT-PCR negative case with one death (the serum sample had been collected
late, hence the RT-PCR result was negative), and 5 IgM negative, RT-PCR
positive cases (all 5 patients suffered fulminating illness and died before
they could develop any immune response). So we had a total of 18 (11+2+5)
confirmed cases with 7 (5+1+1) deaths among the confirmed cases. The most
infected province is Sistan-Baluchestan province in the south east of Iran.
It should be mentioned that for some of the biological reagents used in
serological survey, such as antigens and immune ascitis, we have had
scientific assistance from the Pasteur Institutes of Paris and Dakar. (The
recombinant antigen used in ELISA tests has been produced as a scientific
collaboration between our lab and the Unite Postulante de Genetique
Moleculaire des Bunyavirides of the Pasteur Institute of Paris). Also, for
different aspects of our molecular survey, we have had scientific
collaborations with the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control,
the Canadian Science Center for Human and Animal Health (Winnipeg, Canada),
and the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston).
