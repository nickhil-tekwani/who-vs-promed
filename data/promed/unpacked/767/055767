Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is a major constraint to cassava (_Manihot esculenta_) production in Africa. CMD-associated begomoviruses group either in the _African cassava mosaic virus_ (ACMV) or _East African cassava mosaic virus_ (EACMV) clusters. In August 2014, leaf samples were collected from 5 symptomatic cassava plants in Cameroon, and from 3 symptomatic plants in Togo to determine suspected begomoviruses associated with CMD. Total DNA was isolated, circular, single-stranded DNA was enriched by rolling circle amplification (RCA) and products were pooled by country of origin and sequenced. Sequence reads were assembled into full-length viral sequences (ca. 2.7 kb).

In addition to the ACMV DNA-A and B components as expected, the DNA-A and B components of _Soybean chlorotic blotch virus_ (SbCBV) and _West African Asystasia virus 1_ (WAAV1) were also identified. For SbCBV, sequence identities ranged from 97-99 and 95-96 per cent for the DNA-A and B components, respectively, whereas for WAAV1, sequence identities ranged from 92-95 and 93-96 per cent for the DNA-A and B components, respectively.

To confirm the presence of SbCBV and WAAV1 in the cassava samples, PCR was carried out. Amongst the 5 samples collected from Cameroon, 3 were infected only with ACMV, 1 was infected with ACMV and WAAV1, and 1 was infected with ACMV, SbCBV and WAAV1. The 3 Togolese samples were all infected with ACMV and 1 was also infected with SbCMV. To our knowledge, this is the first report that cassava may be infected by SbCBV or WAAV1 in Africa.

The isolates shared a close phylogenetic relatedness with previously described SbCBV and WAAV1 isolates, respectively. This indicated that cassava-associated isolates are strains or isolates of SbCBV and WAAV1 based on the guidelines of the ICTV Geminiviridae Study Group for strain and species demarcation. The grouping of EACMV, SbCBV, WAAV1, and Madagascar Asystasia virus (MAAV) together in a separate clade, suggests that they have probably evolved from a common ancestor, despite perhaps recent adaptation to host plants representing different plant families.

Whether symptoms caused by SbCBV and WAAV1 are masked by the presence of ACMV in cassava remains to be determined. Giving the small number of samples analysed, further work is required to understand the contribution of these 2 viruses in cassava mosaic disease epidemiology in Africa.

[Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) has triggered food emergencies in the past by destroying cassava crops throughout whole regions. It is caused by a number of species and strains in the genus _Begomovirus_ which seem to be associated with it in different areas. Co-infections as well as genetic recombination between strains have also been reported, and recombinant
strains can be particularly virulent.

CMD symptoms include leaf mosaic, distortion and stunting of plants leading to severe reduction of tuber yields. The CMD viruses are spread by whitefly vectors and with infected plant material (including seed tubers). At least one of them (_African cassava mosaic virus_; ACMV) has also been found in an alternative host (soybean) suggesting that these viruses may have a wider host reservoir and may pose a threat to other crops as well. Disease management for begomoviruses usually relies on control of their vectors as well as pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants, but these methods have proven unsatisfactory in developing countries.

Because most traditional cassava cultivars are susceptible to CMD, varieties resistant to different viral strains are being developed for local use. In Africa, this has alleviated the problem in some areas, but in others, the new varieties are being wiped out by _Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV; genus _Ipomovirus_ and transmitted like CMD). Recent outbreaks of CBSD appear to indicate a westward spread of the viruses (ProMED-mail post 20130508.1698543). A new CBSV strain adapted to higher altitudes has emerged in eastern Africa and is affecting additional CMD resistant cultivars (ProMED-mail posts 20100525.1735 and 20120706.1191742). Joint management of both diseases has become a major challenge in the region and globally (ProMED-mail post 20110829.2643) since development of crop varieties with stable resistance to multiple viruses is particularly difficult (ProMED-mail post 20090709.2463). The different viruses can be expected to mutate independently resulting in a range of changing combinations of strains, and different crop varieties are likely to be needed which are geared towards local viral populations.

The findings above point towards a complex epidemiology of CMD possibly involving additional viruses as well as potential synergistic interactions between them (see also ProMED-mail post 20040915.2571). As stated in the report, it will be important to assess the role of SbCBV and WAAV1 in CMD infected cassava crops and whether or in which way they contribute to the disease.
