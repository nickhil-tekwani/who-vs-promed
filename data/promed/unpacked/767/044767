Two people are taking antibiotics after handling samples taken from a
bull at a dairy farm in Orimattila in [the province of Southern
Finland]. The bull was later found to have anthrax. According to
Ville Lehtinen, a specialist in communicable diseases at the Finnish
National Public Health Institute, the animal did not exhibit symptoms
typical of anthrax, for which reason the handlers of the samples had
not taken special precautions. The diagnosis came after the animal
had been examined by a veterinarian because of an infection.

Prophylactic medication was administered to the 2 employees who had
handled the samples in a laboratory. The medication was a precaution,
as they had not exhibited any symptoms. "People catch serious anthrax
infections through the lungs, and there was the risk in handling wet
samples that the bacteria might become airborne in small particles,"
Lehtinen says.

The young bull found to have the disease was put down. In the coming
week veterinary officials will examine all of the cattle on the farm
for possible anthrax infection. One other animal on the farm has been
exhibiting fever. A partial quarantine is in effect at the farm: no
animals or animal feed may be taken from it.

Head inspector Sirpa Kiviruusu of the Finnish Food Safety Authority
EVIRA believes that the infection has come from the soil on the farm,
where anthrax spores can live for decades. "It is possible that soil
may have gone into the animal feed on a wet summer like this,"
Kiviruusu says. She adds that there is no indication that the disease
would have spread outside the farm.

It is the 2nd time in 4 years that anthrax was found on the farm in
question. Four years ago [2004] anthrax was found on the farm, and at
that time, no source was found for the outbreak. Suspicions focused
on a grazing meadow, where 2 cows were buried decades earlier. The
meadow has been closed to animals since.

Sirpa Kiviruusu says that another possible source of the disease is a
bone meal factory that lies upstream, but there is no certainty.

According to Kiviruusu, officials are looking into whether or not
mistakes were made in the previous inspection. She emphasises that no
fault has been found in how the farm was managed. The farm has about
20 head of cattle. "It is an ordinary Finnish farm, and the people
there have not caused this by their own action," Kiviruusu says.
Measures now being considered include scraping the topsoil to get rid
of possible spores.

[The Finns are cautious. If you have gloved hands, are sensible, and
don't scratch your face (believe me, it happens in the post-mortem
room and during field necropsies!) there should be no risk of getting
anthrax when handling samples from an infected animal. It should be
normal procedure to wear gloves when handling any necropsy samples.
It seems that in August 2004, 10 veterinary students involved in an
inconclusive necropsy of a dead cow from this farm were treated with
antibiotics; a prior cow was diagnosed with anthrax; the 3rd was
treated and recovered. Apparently someone had used a high-pressure
hose on the cow carcass.

From this report it would seem that the bull was put down after the
diagnosis was obtained. This would imply that the animal was ill for
some 36 to 48 hours before being put down, unless diagnosis was based
on a stained blood smear, which is uncommon these days outside of
Latin America. This would suggest that the _Bacillus anthracis _
strain may be of lower virulence, as bovine anthrax is normally a
hyperacute problem with animals being found dead. As the outbreak
progresses sick animals can be picked out and sometimes treatment is
successful -- according to my friend Sam Holland in about 50 percent
of cases; it is cost effective to treat apparently healthy stock that
may be incubating disease. Unfortunately in a minority of countries
animals suspected of having anthrax are put down and treatment not attempted.

If our Finnish colleagues could keep us apprised of their ongoing
investigation of this outbreak, it would be appreciated. - Mod.MHJ
