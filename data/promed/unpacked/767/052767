Anthrax is suspected to have been transmitted to humans from a
diseased cow in a Pabna village [Rajshahi Division] recently affecting
at least 26 people, officials in Dhaka and Pabna said.

On information, a team comprised of specialists from the Institute of
Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), and Livestock
Department collected blood and skin tissues from several affected
people at Choto Pathail village under Santhia upazila [subdistrict] on
[27 Aug 2009].

The team also sent the specimens for biopsy at the laboratories of
IEDCR and Institute of Cholera and Diarrhoeal Diseases Research,
Bangladesh (ICDDR,B).

Senior scientific officer of IEDCR Moshtaque Hossain acknowledged the
specimens being tested at 2 labs to ascertain the suspected anthrax
transmission in humans but declined to elaborate on the matter. Dr
Apurba Chakrabarty, a member of the team that visited the affected
people, said he was not authorised to divulge anything to the press
about the suspected anthrax issue.

Talking to The Daily Star yesterday [31 Aug 2009], civil surgeon of
Pabna Dr AHM Khairul Alam Choudhury said the specimens were sent to
Dhaka for tests on suspicion of anthrax but he said he would not be
able to confirm it as yet.

Officials in Pabna said some people of Choto Pathail village were
infected with the suspected anthrax after consuming meat of a diseased
cow. The livestock department officials confirmed the infection of
anthrax in the cow.

Villagers said the disease spread first among the people who processed
the cow after it was slaughtered. The people who ate the meat of the
cow also fell sick. At first, 17 persons were infected with the
disease in Santhia upazila. Later, the number of patients increased in
the area. Santhia upazila health department sources confirmed the
number of affected people to be 26.

Of the suspected anthrax affected people, [17 adults and children are
stated to be in critical condition].

Santhia Upazila health officer Dr Md Monsurul Alam told The Daily
Star, "We have given the patients a medicine course of 10 days. The
disease can spread through eating meats of infected animals and also
from people who have already contracted the disease." [Human-to-human
transmission is not a feature of anthrax. - Mod.JW]

Pabna District livestock officer Md Abdul Hamid confirmed to The Daily
Star that they have already identified the disease in the animal. "We
have visited the spot with the team that came from Dhaka. We have
examined the bone and flesh of the dead animal and confirmed the
anthrax disease. At least 3 cows died from the disease last week [week
of 24 Aug 2009]," he said.

Deputy civil surgeon of Pabna Dr Dipak Kumar told The Daily Star that
until they get test reports from Dhaka the district health department
officials would continue keeping watch so that the disease does not
spread further.

have been infected with the suspected anthrax raising the number to

2009]. Santhia upazila health officer Monsurul Alam told The Daily
Star that the civil surgeon along with medical officials concerned
visited the village on Tuesday [1 Sep 2009].

Earlier on [27 Aug 2009], specialists from Dhaka visited Choto Pathail
and collected specimens of blood and skin tissues from a few among
another 26 infected villagers for laboratory tests in Dhaka.
Meanwhile, the district health and livestock departments formed
respective teams to keep an eye on the anthrax threat.

The livestock department vaccinated at least 450 cows in the affected
village to check the spread of the disease, official sources said.

Upazila health department sources said the condition of a woman is
critical but the overall situation is improving. Dr AHM Md Khairul
Alam Choudhury, the civil surgeon of Pabna, told the Daily Star
yesterday [2 Sep 2009], "The situation is improving and we are waiting
for the test results."

[Confirming human cases of anthrax is always a problem. My friend and
colleague Benyamin Cherrkaskiy would tell me that in Russia they were
fortunate if they could confirm 30 percent of their clinical cases.
His advice was to insert a biopsy needle underneath the cutaneous
lesion. The problem is that humans are given to self-treatment with
antibiotics. However the Bangladeshi veterinary authorities had
confirmed the initial bovine case. - Mod.MHJ]

[Note that there are fewer cases reported in these versions than in
the previous ProMED post on this outbreak, and they are characterized
as still only suspected, pending test results, -- see below. - Mod.JW.]
