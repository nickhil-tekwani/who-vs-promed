The epidemic of dengue in Venezuela seems to be a serious one, although
information is not provided on the incidence rates by state, by district,
and by socioeconomic strata within specific states. The fact that more
that 20,000 cases (about 3,000 hemorrhagic) have been diagnosed in 14
states speak of the seriousness of the situation.
The editor of ProMED-mail [CHC indicated that:
"Dr. Villalobos de Chacon (Epidemiologist) had also warned that in areas
where rodents occur, one should rule out hemorrhagic fever and that the
scientific community should be aware that "hantaviruses" could arrive in
Venezuela "because the mechanism of transmission is similar to that of
hemorrhagic fever or Guanarito fever".
This translation is cumbersome and difficult to understand. I know that
Guanarito virus was isolated by a young veterinarian working in the
Instituto Nacional de Higiene en Venezuela from rats captured in Guanarito,
a country side of the Portuguesa State, where rice is cultivated. I'm not
sure if the reservoir (rats or others I am not aware of) had spread the
Guanarito virus all around the country. I hope not.

[The point was that there is no relation between the epidemiology of dengue
and the epidemiology of either Guanarito or hantaviruses. I know of no
suggestion or even intimation that Guanarito virus activity has increased
or that the geographic distribution of that virus has changed. - Mod.CHC
