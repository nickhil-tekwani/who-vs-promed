Two studies in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and a research letter in JAMA Internal Medicine [see section [B] below] this week found that myocarditis -- inflammation of the heart muscle -- following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination is rare and usually mild.

Younger men seemed to be at increased risk of the condition, however, and today [7 Oct 2021] Finland joined Sweden and Denmark in pausing the Moderna vaccine among young men after a Nordic study found a slightly elevated risk in that demographic. On 25 Jun 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration added a warning to the fact sheets for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines about both myocarditis and pericarditis (inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart).

Myocarditis in Israel
---------------------
In a nationwide population study, researchers led by Dror Mevorach looked at 5 442 696 Israelis 16 and older who were at least partially vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine (94.2% received 2 doses) and compared them with 3 847 069 unvaccinated people (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2109730). During that time, 283 people had probable or definitive myocarditis, with 142 cases (50.2%) linked to the Pfizer vaccine. Of those, 136 were definitive or probable. Almost 95% of vaccine-linked myocarditis cases were mild, but one fulminant (sudden and quickly escalating) case was fatal. Surveillance occurred from the vaccine's market introduction, 20 Dec 2020, to 31 May 2021.

Of the vaccinated people with myocarditis, 117 had myocarditis after the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine, compared with 19 after the 1st dose. Age and sex data were available for 95 people, of whom 91% were male and 76% were under 30 years of age.

The myocarditis risk difference between the 1st and 2nd dose was 1.76 cases per 100 000 people (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33-2.19), or less than a 0.002% incidence. The largest difference was among male recipients 16-19 years, who had 13.73 cases per 100 000 (CIs 8.11-19.46) -- but even that level amounts to only a 0.014% incidence.

In other words, compared with unvaccinated people, vaccinated people had a 2.35 rate ratio of myocarditis 30 days after the 2nd dose (CI 1.10-5.02). Vaccinated young males had an 8.96 rate ratio (CI 4.50-17.83).

The researchers note that the standardized incidence ratio declined with age among the boys and men: It was 13.60 in those 16-19, 8.53 in those 20-24, 6.96 in those 25-29, and 2.90 in those 30 and older. Overall, data suggested that myocarditis occurred in about 1 of 26 000 men and 1 of 218 000 women after the 2nd vaccine dose. Most cases manifested within a week after the 2nd dose in young men.

"The mechanism of vaccine-induced myocarditis is not known but may be related to the active component of the vaccine, the mRNA sequence that codes for the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or to the immune response that follows vaccination," write the researchers.

In the other NEJM study, researchers looked at data from Israel's Clalit Health Services, which covers about 52% of the total population and is approximately representative of the country's socioeconomics and coexisting disease prevalence (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110737).

Overall, the investigators found 2.13 myocarditis cases per 100 000 people -- again, incidence about 0.002% -- with the highest incidence in men 16-29 years old (10.69/100 000 [0.011% incidence]) (CIs, 1.56-2.70 and 6.93-14.46, respectively).

Out of more than 2.5 million vaccinated people aged 16 and older, 54 myocarditis cases linked with the Pfizer vaccine were identified, with 41 mild (76%), 12 intermediate (22%), and 1 that was linked to cardiogenic shock. Discharge info was available for 38 of the cases. About 94% of cases were in boys and men, and the median age was 27 years. A strong majority (83%) had no coexisting medical conditions, although 13% were receiving treatment for chronic diseases, 2 had COVID-19 at least 125 days prior to vaccination and 1 had ventricular dysfunction prior to vaccination.

The presenting symptom was chest pain for 82%, and left ventricular function was normal on hospital admission in 71% of 48 patients. All myocarditis patients were hospitalized (median stay, 3 days), and discharge information was available for 38. Ten patients still had dysfunction at the time of discharge, but 5 of them had normal heart function during follow-up testing. One patient with a history of pericarditis had to be readmitted 3 more times, and a patient with pre-existing cardiac disease died of unknown causes after discharge.

"The diagnosis of myocarditis occurred throughout the postvaccination period, but there appeared to be an increase approximately 3-5 days after the 2nd vaccine dose," write the researchers. "The follow-up period in our cohort (median, 83 days) was too short to ascertain the long-term prognosis of patients with myocarditis after vaccination."

While these numbers differ a bit from the full population study, Mevorach and colleagues address this in their discussion. "That [Clalit Health] study showed a somewhat lower incidence of myocarditis, possibly because of the different methods that were used," they write, noting that they had specific follow-up deadlines after each dose, whereas lead author Guy Witberg and colleagues did a general follow-up after the 1st dose.

"The study design may have led to an underestimation of myocarditis cases owing to a shorter follow-up for the 2nd dose," Mevorach and colleagues wrote. "In our study, the rate of myocarditis in the general unvaccinated population was 1 per 10 857 and can be compared with findings indicating that myocarditis was more common after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after vaccination, as reported previously by Barda et al," a 16 Sep 2021 mRNA vaccine safety study also conducted in Israel (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110475).

The JAMA Internal Medicine research letter was the only investigation whose cohort included both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2784800). Analyzing data on 2 392 924 at least partially vaccinated adults in the Kaiser Permanente health system, the researchers found 15 cases of confirmed myocarditis, with 2 after the 1st and 13 after the 2nd dose.

Incidence was 0.8 cases per 1 million 1st doses and 5.8 per 1 million 2nd doses over a 10-day observation window -- or a 0.0006% incidence -- even rarer than in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) studies.

Compared with 1 577 741 unvaccinated Kaiser Permanente patients, who had 75 incidences of myocarditis during the study period, the incidence rate ratio was 0.38 after the 1st dose and 2.7 after the 2nd dose (95% CIs, 0.05-1.40 to 1.4-4.8, respectively).

All myocarditis cases linked with vaccination were in men 40 years or younger (median age, 25) with no cardiac disease history. Fourteen (93%) had chest pain 1-5 days post-vaccination, and all were discharged from the hospital within a week without needing intensive care. None required readmission.

The study took place from 14 Dec 2020 to 20 Jul 2021 in southern California. Half of the vaccinated cohort received Moderna, and half received Pfizer. The median age of vaccinees was 49 years, but 35.7% were less than 40. The vast majority (93.5%) received 2 doses. About 54% of participants were women, and 31.2% were white.

"This vaccinated cohort is unique in its racial and ethnic diversity and in receiving care at community hospitals with treatment reflective of real-world practice," the researchers write. "No relationship between COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and postvaccination myocarditis can been established given the observational nature of this study."

A related editorial by Vinay Guduguntla and Mitchell H Katz adds, "Data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System indicate that [myocarditis] is not unique to just the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Moreover, this risk is small when weighed with the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infection, in which up to 28% of hospitalized patients showed signs of myocardial injury. "However, it would be worthwhile to identify the mechanism of cardiac injury from vaccines. In addition, we anticipate seeing more cases of myocarditis, as vaccination was recently approved for teenage males aged 12-16 years" (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2784801).

[The Kaiser study in California found an incidence of 0.0006% of 2 392 924 individuals, an impressive figure, even more so since those who experienced myocarditis were released from the hospital in one week with no readmission. The Israeli study found a higher incidence -- of approximately 0.002% -- with the highest incidence in men 16-29 years old. But, as with the US study, the condition was temporary, with one exception when a patient died. Time will tell whether there is an increase in this vaccine adverse event when more individuals in the 12 to 16 year age group are vaccinated. And we will also learn whether the myocarditis leaves any long-term problem not yet detected. - Mod.LK]

[C] Vaccination strategy
Date: Wed 6 Oct 2021

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/health/covid-vaccine-children-dose.html


Even as parents in the United States wrestle with difficult questions over vaccinating their children against the coronavirus, families in other countries have been offered a novel option: giving children just one dose of the vaccine.

Officials in Hong Kong as well as in Britain, Norway and other countries have recommended a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children ages 12 and older -- providing partial protection from the virus, but without the potential harms occasionally observed after 2 doses. Health officials in those countries are particularly worried about increasing data suggesting that myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart, may be commoner among adolescents and young adults after vaccination than had been thought.

The risk remains very small, and significant only after the 2nd dose of an mRNA vaccine. But the numbers have changed the risk-benefit calculus in countries where new infections are mostly lower than in the United States. Advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed data on myocarditis in June [2021], and unanimously voted to recommend the vaccine for children ages 12 and older, saying the benefits far outweighed the risk.

Agency research has estimated that for every million vaccinated boys ages 12-17 in the United States, the shots might cause a maximum of 70 myocarditis cases, but they would prevent 5700 infections, 215 hospitalizations and 2 deaths. Studies have also shown that the risk of heart problems after COVID-19 is much higher than after vaccination.

Myocarditis was among the concerns that led the Food and Drug Administration to ask vaccine makers this summer [2021] to increase the number of children in clinical trials. The issue is likely to be the focus of intense discussion when agency advisers meet later this month [October 2021] to review the evidence for vaccinations of children ages 5-11.

[2] WHO: steps to achieve vaccination target
Date: Thu 7 Oct 2021

https://www.who.int/news/item/07-10-2021-who-un-set-out-steps-to-meet-world-covid-vaccination-targets


The World Health Organization (WHO) has today [7 Oct 2021] launched the Strategy to Achieve Global COVID-19 Vaccination by mid-2022 to help bring an end to what has become a 2-track pandemic: People in poorer countries continue to be at risk while those in richer countries with high vaccination rates enjoy much greater protection.

WHO had set a target to vaccinate 10% of every country, economy and territory by the end of September [2021] but by that date 56 countries had not been able to do so, the vast majority of these are countries in Africa and the Middle East. The new strategy outlines a plan for achieving WHO's targets to vaccinate 40% of the population of every country by the end of this year [2021] and 70% by mid-2022.

"Science has played its part by delivering powerful, life-saving tools faster than for any outbreak in history," said WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. "But the concentration of those tools in the hands of a few countries and companies has led to a global catastrophe, with the rich protected while the poor remain exposed to a deadly virus. We can still achieve the targets for this year and next, but it will take a level of political commitment, action and cooperation, beyond what we have seen to date."

"This is a costed, coordinated and credible path out of the COVID-19 pandemic for everyone, everywhere," said United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres. "Without a coordinated, equitable approach, a reduction of cases in any one country will not be sustained over time. For everyone's sake, we must urgently bring all countries to a high level of vaccination coverage."

To achieve the global vaccination targets, there should be a 3-step approach to vaccination, with all older adults, health workers, and high-risk groups of all ages, in every country vaccinated first, followed by the full adult age-group in every country and lastly extended vaccination of adolescents.

Vaccinating 70% of the global population requires at least 11 billion vaccine doses. By the end of September [2021], just over 6 billion doses had already been administered worldwide. With global vaccine production now at nearly 1.5 billion doses per month, there is sufficient vaccine from a supply perspective to achieve the global vaccination targets provided that there is equitable distribution of those doses.

Substantial financing has already been invested to procure most of the required vaccine doses for low- and lower middle-income countries through COVAX, the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust (AVAT) and bilateral contracts. There needs to be additional investment to secure the remaining vaccine doses for these countries as well as investment to support in-country delivery.

[3] Pfizer vaccine: children 5-11 years
Date: Thu 7 Oct 2021
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]

Pfizer and BioNTech asked federal regulators on Thursday [7 Oct 2021] to authorize emergency use of their coronavirus vaccine for children ages 5-11, a move that could help protect more than 28 million people in the United States. The companies say they are submitting data supporting the change to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The agency has promised to move quickly on the request and has tentatively scheduled a meeting on 26 Oct 2021 to consider it. An FDA ruling is expected as early as the end of October.

A meeting of expert advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been scheduled for 2-3 Nov 2021, according to people familiar with the planning. CDC's recommendations are typically the federal government's last word on vaccine policy.

"With new cases in children in the US continuing to be at a high level, this submission is an important step in our ongoing effort against COVID-19," Pfizer said on Thursday [7 Oct 2021].

Parents across the United States are anxiously awaiting the regulators' decision, which could affect many aspects of family life and the operation of schools. Clearance depends not only on the strength of the clinical trial data, but also on whether the companies can prove to regulators that they are able to properly manufacture a new pediatric formulation.

Pfizer's announcement came on the same day President Biden visited Illinois to encourage employers to impose vaccine requirements, part of a broader effort by the White House to reach the tens of millions of Americans who remain unvaccinated. Mr Biden last month [September 2021] announced he would mandate vaccination or weekly testing for workers at companies with more than 100 employees.

"We have the tools, we're using them, and we're making progress," Mr Biden said on Thursday [7 Oct 2021]. "We just have to finish the job."

Shots for children represent another critical phase of the administration's vaccination campaign, potentially allowing schools, workplaces and other venues to operate with fewer disruptions as the pandemic persists.

Pfizer has proposed giving children one-third of the adult dosage. Depending on what formulation Pfizer produces pediatric doses in, that might require adding a different amount of diluent to each injection or using a different vial or syringe. The company was expected to describe the method it intended to use in its submission to the FDA. Regulators will have to examine the purity and stability of mass-manufactured doses of the vaccine and determine that it matches the quality and potency of doses given to children in clinical trials.

Children rarely become severely ill from COVID-19, but the delta variant landed nearly 30 000 of them in hospitals in August [2021]. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, nearly 5.9 million Americans under 18 have been infected with the coronavirus. Of the roughly 500 Americans under 18 who have died, about 125 were aged 5 to 11.

"It really bothers me when people say kids don't die of COVID," said Dr Grace Lee, an associate chief medical officer at Stanford Children's Health who also leads a key advisory committee to the CDC. "They die of COVID. It's heartbreaking."

About 1 in 6 Americans infected since the beginning of the pandemic was under 18. But with the surge of the delta variant, children accounted for as many as 1 in 4 infections last month [September 2021], according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. The FDA authorized emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 12 to 15 year olds in May [2021]. Since then, more than 8.2 million children in that age-group have received at least one dose, and more than 6.7 million have been fully vaccinated.

The infection rate in the United States is currently falling, prompting hope that the wave caused by the delta variant is ebbing. But public health experts worry that the onset of colder weather could result in increased transmission.

Pfizer's clinical trial for children was not intended to draw meaningful conclusions about the vaccine's ability to prevent disease or hospitalizations. Instead, researchers looked at antibody levels, comparing them with those that had conferred high protection in adults. Regulators are expected to compare the immune responses with vaccine efficacy data in the adult population.

The trial included 2268 children, two-thirds of whom had received 2 doses of the vaccine 3 weeks apart. The remaining volunteers were injected with 2 doses of a saltwater placebo. Regulators over the summer [2021] asked for the trial size to be expanded to 3000 children.

[The dose for children would be lower, the proposed dosage being one-third the adult dose. But parents are nonetheless weighing potential adverse vaccine effects, albeit rare in older individuals, with protection from COVID disease. But the children's clinical trial was much smaller than the adult trial, so rare events might not have been detected. If one dose offered sufficient protection, that might alleviate some of the fear. - Mod.LK]
