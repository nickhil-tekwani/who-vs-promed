A herd of 400 steers aged 15 months old on an estancia near Arroyo Las Flores and 25 km from General Alvear city in the province of Buenos Aires has suffered an outbreak of livestock anthrax.

There were 2 acute deaths. At the time, they were grazing sorghum and receiving a protein supplement. The pasture boundary is along the arroyo Las Flores, which has been flooded by rain and drains into the Salado river across a low lying piece of ground. This is a classic black alkaline soil, locally known as Argiduoles, and capable of supporting a long survival time for anthrax spores.

A metacarpal bone was submitted for diagnosis, and _Bacillus anthracis_ was isolated. The culture was sensitive to the following antibiotics -- penicillin, tetracycline, gentamicin, florfenicol and ciprofloxacin -- and resistant to trimethoprim. The herd had been vaccinated against anthrax approximately 90 days earlier. This estancia has suffered anthrax outbreaks in the past. The carcasses were incinerated. The ranch staff took care to not become infected and were instructed and supervised by the attending veterinarian.

General Alvear county has suffered 6 anthrax outbreaks in recent years, 2006 (2), 2007, 2011, 2012, and now in 2015, according to the Area Anthrax Evaluation, Buenos Airs province, (1977-2014); 2 of these were reported by ProMED, see Anthrax, bovine - Argentina (02): (BA) 20110701.2005 and Anthrax, bovine - Argentina (06): (BA) 20121022.1357937.

[This region of the province is under a compulsory vaccination order. For some reason, they see occasional outbreaks in recently vaccinated herds. They have a regular Sterne vaccine with all the necessary plasmid genes to provide protection. Why they have this problem has evaded investigation to date. And note, this recent outbreak was in beef steers, grazing, and not dairy cows, where one can expect a few, during vaccination, to be receiving antibiotics because of mastitis. There is still much to learn with this disease.
