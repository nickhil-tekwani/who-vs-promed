When veterinarians diagnosed MRSA infection in hospitalized Thoroughbred racehorses at 2 veterinary hospitals in Japan not long ago, they wondered about the source of the infection. Such cases are tough to manage and lead to lost training days, all while posing a risk to human health.

The veterinarians, who work for the Japan Racing Association (JRA), conducted a thorough investigation to determine the infection's origin. Taisuke Kuroda, DVM, PhD, presented their findings at the 2017 American Association of Equine Practitioners convention, held [Fri 17-Tue 21 Nov 2017] in San Antonio, Texas.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a Gram-positive bacterium that differs genetically from other S. aureus strains, making it resistant to many antibiotics. Therefore, it is particularly difficult to treat and causes more human deaths than methicillin-susceptible strains.

The bacterium is colonized on the skin and in the nasal passages of humans and animals. Scientists estimate that the level of nasal MRSA colonization in healthy horses is 2 percent in the United Kingdom and 4.7 percent in the United States and Canada. Among people in the veterinary community, the level of nasal MRSA colonization has been shown to be 15.6 percent in the United States, 9.3 percent in Canada, and 21.4 percent in Australia. There are 3 routes of transmission of MRSA in the human population; between people within a community, between health care workers and the larger community and between humans and livestock.

The JRA veterinarians aimed to determine the route of MRSA transmission in the infected horses hospitalized at JRA veterinary hospitals at 2 training centers. They collected nasal swabs from 600 healthy Thoroughbreds housed at the centers, which represented about 30 percent of the horses housed at the JRA training facilities. They also collected nasal swabs from 53 veterinarians, as well as 16 office staff. The office staff acted as controls, as they had no physical contact with any horses.

The team tested the swabs for MRSA, genetically sequencing any bacteria they found to determine which strains were at play. They then compared these to the samples that had been collected from MSRA-infected horses at the hospitals. They did not isolate MRSA from any of the healthy horses or from the office staff, ruling out horse-to-horse transmission. However, they did isolate MRSA from 16 (30.1 percent) of the veterinarians tested. This compares to a nasal MRSA colonization in healthy Japanese people of 1.4 percent. Ten of the 16 strains were classified as SCCmec type II-ST5, which was the same classification as all 9 strains isolated from the infected horses.

These findings show that no MRSA colonization exists within the healthy racehorses at JRA, but a high rate of colonization exists in the JRA veterinary community, said Kuroda. Therefore, MRSA is likely being transferred between the JRA veterinarians and horses. These results show that there is an occupational risk to veterinarians of becoming colonized with MRSA. Additionally, he said, this study confirms the need for strict hygiene management programs within veterinary hospitals to prevent MRSA transmission between veterinarians and horses.

[Subscribers are referred to Mod.LM's comment in posting 20140827.2725468: "Certainly the vast majority of human MRSA infections, both
healthcare-associated and in the community, are related to human-to-human transmission, but the role of animals remains of interest and may be important in situations where there is extensive human-animal contact".

The above-described interesting observation from Japan may indicate another possible direction of MRSA infection, namely human to animal.
