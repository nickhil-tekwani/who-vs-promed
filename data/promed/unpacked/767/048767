20 confirmed cases of canine influenza and 70 suspected cases have
been recorded in San Antonio dogs within the past 30 days, according
to a local veterinarian.

The disease, also known as dog flu, has also been reported in Austin
and Dallas, said Dr. Michele Wright, who helped identify the virus at
a local clinic.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Texas is
one of 38 states where dogs have been exposed to the H3N8 virus.

The 1st San Antonio case originated with 2 dogs that stopped at dog
day care centers and parks, both community sites where dogs could have
contracted the disease, Wright said.

Signs include a fever, runny nose and coughing, but some dogs infected
with the virus do not show symptoms. The virus is not transmitted to
humans, cats or other species. Wright said dogs shed, or transmit, the
virus through secretions that expose it to the environment.

"What's scary for me as a veterinarian is they can act and look
healthy and still be shedding the virus," Wright said.

Two tests can confirm the virus. The vaccine is available at
veterinarian offices.

According to the CDC, the virus was 1st detected in 2004 in
greyhounds. Scientists believe it jumped species from horses to dogs
and adapted to cause sickness and spread among dogs.

Wright said because many local dogs haven't been vaccinated, close to
100 percent would get the virus if exposed. 20 percent would transmit
it but not appear sick. 72 percent would show mild signs of coughing
that could linger for 2 to 3 weeks, and 8 percent could develop
pneumonia that could be life threatening.

Animal Care Services director Gary Hendel said ACS has not confirmed
any cases of canine influenza in the shelter. "It's a situation that
bears watching," Hendel said. "Should that situation change, we will
work with our local veterinary community to identify solutions to
prevent widespread outbreak."

Wright suggested that pet owners vaccinate their dogs; limit visits to
communal areas to prevent exposure, and keep dogs away from
contaminated areas for a month after immunization, to build up
immunity. "I think if we can get people vaccinating, we'll be able to
contain the virus," Wright said. "The hard thing is getting people to
vaccinate in areas that haven't seen it yet."

Dog flu is a contagious respiratory disease in dogs caused by a
specific Type A influenza virus known as canine influenza virus. It is
not a human influenza virus, and people cannot get it.

The virus can be spread to other dogs by direct contact with
respiratory secretions from infected dogs, by contact with
contaminated objects, and by people moving between infected and
uninfected dogs. Nearly all dogs are susceptible to infection, but
most will have a mild form of the disease.

Clinical signs are cough, runny nose and fever; a small proportion of
dogs can develop severe disease, characterized by the onset of
pneumonia. Testing to confirm flu virus infection is done at
veterinary centers. An approved vaccine is available.

[Canine influenza is a type A orthomyxovirus. It mimics "kennel cough"
or _Bordetella brochiseptica_/parainfluenza virus complex, which
sounds like a hacking cough that does not seem to stop. The cough with
canine influenza can be either moist or dry, and about 20 percent of
infected dogs may show little or no clinical signs but still be
shedding virus. Canine influenza is contagious by aerosolized droplets
and contaminated fomites (inanimate objects) that the dog can contact.
People can transmit the disease to their pets.

Unfortunately, treatment is non-specific but generally supportive. It
is important to get treatment early to reduce the death rate.
