[The addition of the 4 outbreaks above brings the number of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in Viet Nam since the start of the recent (recurring) epizootic, on 7 Oct 2013, to an accumulated total of 15, adding 4 central and southern provinces (Long An, Dak Lak, Lao Cai, and Phu Yen) to the 6 already infected (Nam Dinh, Khanh Hoa, Tay Ninh, Quang Ngai, Ca Mau, and Kon Tum). The total number of infected provinces, throughout Viet Nam, has thus become 10.

For an interactive map, showing the geographical locations of all 15 accumulated outbreaks, see OIE's summary report at http://tinyurl.com/pngnrqw (click to centre, zoom in). As can be seen on the map, 2 of the outbreaks are adjacent to Viet Nam's border with Cambodia, where new outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 have been recently reported (see ProMED-mail post 20140213.2275510).

Information on the identity of the affected poultry in each of the 4 new outbreaks (chicken, duck, goose) will be helpful. - Mod.AS
