Hundreds of sea lions, suffering from a bacterial disease that can cause
kidney failure, are stranded, sick, and dying on shores from Central
California to British Columbia this year [2004]. The disease, known as
leptospirosis, strikes sea lions in large numbers every few years. This
year's outbreak, now waning, took an especially heavy toll not only on the
animals, but also on the people who care for them.
Local rescuers based in Moss Landing started hauling in sick sea lions in
June 2004 then watched helplessly, as many succumbed to kidney failure.
The Marine Mammal Center, a nonprofit based in Sausalito, has rescued 293
sea lions sick with leptospirosis as of 6 Dec 2004, said Kathy Zagzebski,
stranding department manager. The previous record was 224, set in 1995.
More than 60 percent of this year's [2004] rescued sea lions have been sick
with the bacterial infection, Zagzebski said. In 2003, a non-outbreak year,
that number was less than 5 percent.
Consider the case of Ivan, a 150-pound juvenile sea lion who pulled himself
onto the shore just north of Pebble Beach's picturesque Bird Rock in late
October 2004. He was probably 2 to 4-years old, a little too young to
breed, so maybe he was just roaming up and down the coast, Zagzebski said.
Ivan exhibited telltale signs of leptospirosis. He was lethargic, letting
people approach too closely, and he was drinking fresh water from a little
stream flowing down the rocks. Sea lions don't normally drink water,
Andrews said, but infected, dehydrated animals often strand near streams,
storm water outfalls, and freshwater dock hoses.
Another sign, she said, is a characteristic body posture in which the
animal lies with rear flippers pulled up and front flippers crossed over
its belly. "It looks like an animal with a belly ache," Andrews said.
Rescue volunteers converged on Pebble Beach on the sunny morning of 27 Oct
2004 armed with herding boards and a custom-made net. They deftly netted
Ivan and ushered him into a beige plastic carrier fit for a Great Dane.
Ivan's 1st stop was Moss Landing, where new patients typically spend 2 days
in quarantine. Volunteers then trucked him north to the center's Sausalito
hospital where he joined dozens of other sick animals. The day after Ivan's
rescue, the hospital housed 50 patients: one northern elephant seal and 49
California sea lions. "Most of these animals are all leptospirosis guys in
various stages of rehab," said Martin Haulena, a veterinarian at the hospital.
A tiny, flexible, spiral-shaped bacterium named leptospira had infected the
animals and multiplied in their kidneys. Researchers think infections are
spread via infected urine. Hospital staff work to beat back the infections
with antibiotics. They try to rehydrate the animals and gradually coax them
into eating again the protein-rich diet that their failed kidneys couldn't
handle, Haulena said. It's a delicate balancing act.
Recovery from leptospirosis usually takes about 6 to 8 weeks of treatment,
he said. But this year [2004], most animals didn't go home. Most died of
kidney failure. The usual mortality rate is about 50 percent, Haulena said.
This year, it was up around 70 percent. "These things are dying on you
despite your best effort," he said, pointing to sea lion Lorenzo, lying
listless and emaciated after weeks of hospital care. "And, that's very,
very frustrating," Haulena said. "It seems like the infections are a lot
more severe this year than in past years."
This outbreak was also more widespread than most. For the 1st time since
the early 1990s, British Columbia saw cases, said Stephen Raverty, a
veterinary pathologist with the provincial government. That far north,
lepto shows up every 10 to 12 years, he said, apparently from infected
animals migrating up from the south, coinciding with the major California
outbreaks.
In the past, California researchers have seen an outbreak every 4 to 5
years, said Frances Gulland, a Marine Mammal Center veterinarian on the
front lines of leptospirosis research. But over the past 10 years, the
outbreaks have become more frequent, she said, now about every 3 years.
Scientists don't know exactly what drives the ups and downs of
leptospirosis. One contributing factor may be the phenomenon of "herd
immunity," said George Ghneim, a veterinarian who studied the disease as a
graduate student at the University of California at Davis. Disease exposure
this year [2004] confers immunity to many survivors, making it harder for
the disease to spread next year. In the future, with new pups added to the
population, the number of vulnerable individuals will grow. When the
susceptible population is large enough, another outbreak can occur.
It's possible that exposure to leptospira is not the only factor, Ghneim
said. The stresses of migration or food scarcity might also contribute. The
bacterium is not believed to survive long in salt water, so exposure to
fresh water might be important too. It's still a mystery and an area of
active research for scientists.
The Ocean Conservancy, a national nonprofit group concerned with issues of
ocean health, is not working directly on leptospirosis, said Kaitlin
Gaffney of the group's Monterey Bay office. But it does have a general
concern about near-shore pollution and other factors that might contribute
to immune-system compromise, making animals more vulnerable to diseases and
parasites, she said.
Gulland said she thinks the increased outbreak frequency might be linked to
sea lions' recent population increase and higher densities. In the United
States, sea lion numbers have been increasing about 5 percent per year over
the past 30 years, said researcher Robert DeLong of the National Marine
Fisheries Service in Seattle. In 1972, Congress passed the Marine Mammal
Protection Act, banning hunting or harming sea lions and other marine mammals.
Now numbering about 250 000, the population may be approaching a maximum
level, DeLong said, because of the deadly effects of a hookworm that
infects pups. Leptospirosis, he said, is not likely to significantly affect
population numbers so long as it stays confined mostly to males.
Officials recommend that beachgoers and dogs steer clear of stranded sea
lions. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control, leptospira has
been found in dogs, rodents, and other animals, as well as humans.
Outbreaks are usually caused by exposure to contaminated fresh water, and
most cases occur in temperate and tropical zones. The Marine Mammal Center
is not aware of any human cases associated with this year's [2004]
leptospirosis outbreak in sea lions, said stranding manager Zagzebski.
And what about Ivan, who was stranded at Pebble Beach? He died of
leptospirosis on 3 Nov 2004, a week after his rescue. Experts expect the
long-lasting outbreak to abate naturally soon. September 2004 was the
busiest month, when the Marine Mammal Center admitted 104 sea lions with
leptospirosis, said Zagzebski. In November 2004, that number was down to
25. Rescuers say they are looking forward to the end of this year's cycle.
"When you pick up an animal, and you feel it can be rehabilitated, it feels
good," said Anje van der Naald, a 9-year rescue volunteer from Aptos. "This
doesn't feel good." To report a stranded marine mammal, call 415-289-SEAL.

[The situation with the sea mammals is frustrating for rescuers,
veterinarians, and for researchers. Since oral baits for rabies vaccination
of wild animals have been developed, perhaps something similar could be
developed for sea mammals. - Mod.TG]
