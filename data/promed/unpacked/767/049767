We have now confirmed bacterial leaf streak (BLS) of corn in Wisconsin. We have been on the lookout for this disease over the past several seasons, but have not confirmed it officially in the state until now. A corn sample was received with symptoms consistent with those for BLS. The sample was confirmed positive through multiple tests, including bacterial streaming and PCR. Subsequently, the sample has been confirmed positive by multiple laboratories.

Bacterial leaf streak (BLS) of corn was reported for the 1st time on corn in the US in 2016 [ProMED-mail post 20160906.4467551], but was likely present in Nebraska since 2014, with subsequent reports coming in from the corn belt. Other states where the disease has been confirmed include Iowa, Illinois, Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and now Wisconsin.

[_Xanthomonas vasicola_ (previously _campestris_) pv. _vasculorum_ (Xvv) has primarily been reported as a pathogen of sugarcane to cause gumming disease. Gumming is considered one of the most serious diseases of this crop in many countries and was one of the 1st plant diseases proven to be of bacterial aetiology. Xvv leaf streak on maize was previously only known from South Africa, where it has been associated with inoculum from crop residue, overhead irrigation and warm temperatures, but impacts on yield were often minimal. Molecular analysis, including sequencing, has shown a difference in sugarcane and maize infecting strains of Xvv (see links below). A number of graminaceous species, including oats, rice, pasture and weedy grasses, were found to be able to serve as reservoir hosts for Xvv infection of maize (see ProMED-mail post 20180121.5574770). It is not clear if maize infecting strains have emerged naturally, or if intensified agricultural systems may have favoured their evolution.

_Xanthomonas_ pathogens cause a range of important crop diseases, including bacterial blight of banana and rice, citrus canker, and black rot of brassica vegetables (see previous ProMED-posts in the archives). They can survive between seasons on volunteer crop plants or plant debris. They can be seed borne, depending on the host, and they can be spread with infected plant and other materials, by water, and mechanical means (including human and insect activity). Disease management is difficult and may include phytosanitation (control of reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated materials), cultural measures (optimal plant spacing and fertilisers), bacteriocides (such as copper compounds), and use of resistant crop varieties. Genome sequencing of species and pathovars of _Xanthomonas_ is providing information on mechanisms of bacterial virulence.
