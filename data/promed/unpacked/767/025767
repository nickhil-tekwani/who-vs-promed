Eastern equine encephalitis viruses (EEEV) in South America are
neither as widespread nor as virulent as are North American strains.
North American and South American strains can be antigenically (1, 2)
and genetically (3) distinguished.

Despite widespread serologic evidence of the presence of EEEV in
South America, this virus has seldom been associated with human
disease or mortality there. Genotypes of EEEV from North and South
Americas have important differences in their transmission cycles and
virulence, with South American strains being less virulent for humans
than are North American strains (4).

South American subtypes of EEEV certainly are pathogenic for horses
as well as for humans. However, the pathogenicity of these subtypes
is lower for vertebrates than are North American subtypes, not
non-pathogenic, just of lower pathogenicity. Therefore, a case here
and a case there may occur but not be recognized as such.

As noted above, South American subtypes of EEEV do affect livestock,
but, because there are so few cases, little emphasis may be put on
lab-diagnosing these cases and even fewer reported. They do occur, however.

Therefore, it was no surprise to have read [in Eastern equine
encephalitis, equine - Belize (CY) OIE] that few cases of EEE have
been reported from Latin America. It is probable that few cases have occurred.

This is a very bad virus here [in North America] and a bad virus
there [south of here].

[Many thanks for the comments, which clarify the situation.
Clarifying the situation when it comes to the virology of emerging
disease is nothing new for Charlie Calisher. Just search our archives
under Calisher, and you will have 579 items to choose from. You can
pick any of these and learn about viruses, as well as how to write
succinctly and powerfully. - Mod.PC]
