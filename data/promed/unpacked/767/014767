Red squirrels face 2nd outbreak of fatal pox
--------------------------------------------
A 2nd outbreak of a fatal red squirrel disease has been confirmed in
Glenarm Forest in County Antrim. It follows an outbreak of squirrel
pox in County Down 3 months ago.

The disease is carried by the non-native grey squirrel which is
immune to its effects. Infected red squirrels die within 15 days of
contracting the virus. The disease has already had a devastating
effect on native red squirrel populations across the UK.

Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) Senior Wildlife Inspector,
Dr Declan Looney said it was becoming a real cause for concern. "The
previous outbreak was three months ago and over 80 miles away in
County Down," he said.

"We are monitoring the situation but would ask for the public to
remain vigilant and immediately report any squirrels showing signs of
the disease to the NIEA wildlife team or to a member of the NI
Squirrel forum. Many of our native species such as the red squirrel
are increasingly under pressure and it is very important that we do
all we can to protect them."

John Griffin from Dard's Forest Service, added: "We will urgently
begin work with the adjacent landowner Antrim Estates, the Glens Red
Squirrel Group and the other partners within the Northern Ireland
Squirrel Forum to implement control measures to safeguard the local
red squirrel population at Glenarm. We acknowledge the dedication and
vigilance of the Glens Red Squirrel Group which resulted in the
discovery of the 2 suspect cases."

The decline of red squirrels in the UK is blamed primarily on the
effects of squirrel pox as well as the loss of woodlands and
competition from grey squirrels.

[Squirrel pox, a viral disease affecting red squirrels, is carried by
grey squirrels, which show no symptoms of disease. The virus is
thought to have been brought into Britain with grey squirrels
introduced into southern England from America in the early 20th
century. The presence of the virus in the British isles was 1st
confirmed during a disease outbreak in East Anglia in the 1980s; it
has since worked its way steadily northwards, affecting Scotland and
later Northern Island.
