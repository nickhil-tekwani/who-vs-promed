The number of people sickened by _Yersinia enterocolitica_ after
drinking glass-bottled [pasteurized] milk from Brunton Dairy in
Aliquippa [Beaver County] has risen to 14, the Allegheny County Health
Department said today, 8 Aug 2011.

The latest case was a person who became ill on 24 Jul 2011. The cases
confirmed since 15 Jun 2011 include 8 people from Beaver County and 6
from Allegheny. They range in age from 1 to 72.

"What we're finding is that people who are sick with gastrointestinal
distress associated with a _Yersinia_ infection are delaying being
seen by their doctors," county health department spokesman Dave Zazac
said. He urged people with gastrointestinal problems who drank milk
from Brunton Dairy to see a doctor as soon as possible. Fever,
abdominal pain, and diarrhea, often bloody, are the main symptoms in
children, he said. In older children and adults, right-sided abdominal
pain, and fever may be the predominant symptoms and are sometimes
confused with appendicitis.

Brunton Dairy has voluntarily ceased producing milk at its farm and is
cooperating with a combined investigation by the county and state
health departments and the state Agriculture Department.

[No additional cases have been registered since this report, which
adds 4 more to the total in 2 western counties of Pennsylvania. The
mechanism of contamination of the bottled pasteurized milk is as yet
unreported but it is likely to be post-pasteurization. - Mod.LL]
