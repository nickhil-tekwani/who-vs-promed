Experts move against Ebola-like outbreak in Congo
--------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of hemorrhagic fever has been reported in the Ituri region of
northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, near the border with Uganda.
The Rome-based Catholic news agency MISNA said 6 people had died since late
November [2000.
But it is not yet clear if the fever is caused by Ebola virus, which causes
a heavy sweating fever, massive internal bleeding & usually leads to death
within 21 days.
The World Health Organization's country representative in Uganda, Oladapo
Walker, said tests would be carried out and that specialists had already
moved into the affected area.
"Samples have been sent to South Africa for testing and Medecins Sans
Frontieres (MSF) is on top of the situation in the area," he told Reuters
in the Ugandan capital Kampala.
Uganda's health ministry has told officials in the country's western
districts to be on alert for victims of the possible Ebola outbreak moving
across the border. "We have instituted active order surveillance,
intensified health education and stockpiled protective gear in the border
districts," said Francis Okware, the head of Uganda's Ebola task force.
An Ebola outbreak in the north Ugandan district of Gulu killed 162 people
between early September and late December [2000 but no new cases have been
reported since before Christmas.
Lutongo Paluku, a doctor working in Congo, told MISNA he found 5 people
suffering from a hemorrhagic illness in Ituri between 27 Nov 2000 & 10 Dec
2000, all of whom have died, and another 3 cases in nearby Bunia since May
[2000, one of whom has died. He said the victims had shown symptoms
similar to Ebola. Gulu lies about 100 miles (160 km) east of Bunia.

[This outbreak might also be due to Marburg virus, which has been active
recently in the area, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, relapsing fever,
yellow fever or one of the many other African hemorrhagic fevers. Lab
results from South Africa will be definitive. - Mod.JW
