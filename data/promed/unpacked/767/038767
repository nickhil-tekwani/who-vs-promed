Hospital officials warned on Thursday that a severe outbreak of dengue
could strike the city, with many recently admitted patients in the advanced
hemorrhagic stage of the disease. Most patients were in an advanced stage
of viral infection. In some cases, the patients were hemorrhaging when they
were admitted to the hospital.
A hospital spokesperson said she dismissed speculation that dengue was
becoming a more serious problem because of public ignorance about symptoms
of the disease. "People are now more conscientious while dealing with
dengue, mostly after experiencing a dengue fever outbreak in 1998. People
now rush for medical treatment even though it is just a light fever," she said.
Another spokesperson said five to six dengue fever patients were admitted
to his hospital every day. "When the outbreak was at its peak in 1998, the
number could reach 15 patients a day." He said there were 15,000 dengue
cases that year, with 133 fatalities. The city administration previously
warned of the possibility of a dengue fever outbreak this year as seven
people had died of the disease as of March 1. Data at the city's health
agency show there were 1,309 cases through March 1.
