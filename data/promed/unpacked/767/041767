Spotted fever identified in Adelaide
------------------------------------
A potentially fatal disease not previously seen in mainland Australia
has reportedly been identified in Adelaide's southern suburbs and
Fleurieu Peninsula. 4 people have been confirmed with the disease,
which may be linked to climate change or living close to native fauna
where there may be a greater risk of tick bite, the Sunday Mail
reported, 5 Jun 2005.
The disease, rickettsial spotted fever, causes headache, muscle ache,
lethargy and high fever. A telltale spotted rash usually appears on
the limbs and torso several days after the 1st symptoms, and victims
can become very sick, very quickly, with the possibility of death.
The 4 confirmed cases since 2001 -- unrelated women aged 65 and 44
and men aged 74 and 58 -- suffered fever, headache and muscle pain
for about a week then saw a rash appear. All responded quickly to
antibiotics and made a full recovery.
The infection is caused by the bacterium _Rickettsia honei_, found in
ticks that infest sleepy lizards and other reptiles. If the tick
bites a human, the bacterium can spread. Experts at Flinders Medical
Centre believe the cases now confirmed in recent patients may be "the
tip of the iceberg." They want GPs to be alert to the disease, as it
can be treated quickly and effectively with certain antibiotics.
FMC infectious disease physician Dr. John Dyer identified the disease
as spotted fever. Previous confirmed cases were only reported from
Flinders Island in Bass Strait, although there may also have been
cases in Tasmania. Molecular microbiologist Dr. Tania Sadlon is
developing a rapid test for the bacterium and has detected it in many
lizard ticks in SA.
FMC head of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Professor David
Gordon said it was important doctors knew the disease was now in the
community. "It is quite likely this illness has been in our community
for some time; it just has not been recognized," he said. "There are
probably many more cases that have not been diagnosed."
Prof. Gordon said the disease was rarely fatal, but people could
become quite sick, so those with apparent symptoms, such as high
fever, muscle ache and rash, should see their GP.

[Flinders Island is located in the Bass Strait between Victoria and
Tasmania. Adelaide is in South Australia, which is east of Victoria.
These cases, which are not well-described as to when they occurred,
appear to be the 1st recognized cases in South Australia and a new
focus for this infection. This focus was recently described in the
Medical Journal of Australia (Dyer JR, Einsiedel L, Ferguson PE, et
al. A new focus of _Rickettsia honei_ spotted fever in South
Australia. Med J Aust. 2005; 182:231-4). The infection is also known
as Thai tick typhus in Southeast Asia.
Flinders Island spotted fever was 1st reported in 1991, when 26 cases
were identified over 17 years in the population of about 1000 (1).
Like most rickettsioses, it is characterized by fever, headache,
myalgias, arthralgias, and a maculopapular rash. A majority also have
focal skin lesions. Serological studies placed the illness in the
spotted fever group. Genetic analysis of the isolated organism as
compared to other rickettsia led to its designation as _R. honei_
(2). _R. honei_ was subsequently found to be very closely related to
TT-118, a tick typhus organism isolated in Thailand as early as 1962
(3). _R. honei_ has also been isolated from cattle ticks _Amblyomma
cajennense_ in Texas, USA (3).
In Australia, _R. honei_ has been isolated from humans as well as
from _Aponomma hydrosauri_ ticks taken from various reptiles,
including blue-tongued lizards (_Tiliqua nigrolutea_), tiger snakes
(_Notechis ater humphreysi_), and copperhead snakes (_Austrelaps
superbus_) on Flinders Island (3). Vertical transmission via
transovarial spread seems to maintain the organism in the ticks
(4,5). In one study, 63 percent of 46 ticks were found to harbor _R.
honei_, but none of 17 reptiles did (4). Some of the infected ticks
were from the island of Tasmania itself.
