In the subject posting regarding Bovine
Tuberculosis the Moderator described the testing
of animals for bovine tuberculosis (TB) as
involving "2 injections in the neck region, and
those injections must be measured and accessed
for reaction at 72 hours post injection. ....Once
an animal is tested, it cannot be re-tested for a
minimum of 90 days."

Other readers may already have pointed out that
the procedures used to screen cattle herds for
bovine TB in North America are different from
those used in Europe and other countries. In
North America, herds are screened using a single
injection of bovine PPD tuberculin applied to the
caudal fold at the base of the tail. Any animal
that shows a response on this screening test is
then subjected to a comparative tuberculin test
applied in the neck region and/or to a gamma
interferon assay blood test. Also, the vast
majority of, if not all, regulatory jurisdiction
in North America allow tuberculin tests in cattle
to be repeated at intervals of not less than 60
days.

[Dr. Koller is quite correct. In the US we also
use the caudal fold at the base of the tail and
responders are then subjected to comparative
cervical tuberculin or to the gamma interferon
assay. And yes, it cannot be repeated for sooner
than 60 in bovines, 90 days in cervids. Â– Mod.TG]
