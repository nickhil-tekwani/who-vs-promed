Police rummaged through luggage and sprayed cars with disinfectant at
border crossings from Turkey and Romania on Tuesday [10 Jan 2006] as
neighbouring countries tried to stem the spread of deadly bird flu.
Flanked by Turkey and Romania on the Black Sea, Bulgaria said it had
put veterinarian and border officials on high alert. "We are
preparing as if for a war," Simeon Yotovski, director of the regional
veterinary office of Rousse on Bulgaria's Danube border with Romania.
"Inspectors are hand-checking the luggage of everyone entering
Bulgaria. All cars are being sprayed with disinfectant and any
poultry products are being confiscated and burnt."
Officials in Greece and Georgia, which also border Turkey, said they
were taking similar measures. Ukraine, which has reported outbreaks
among poultry in the Crimea region, said it had stepped up monitoring
at its Black Sea ports.
Most of the countries lie on the Pontic migratory route, by which
wild birds travel south from Scandinavia and Siberia to northern
Africa for the winter. Scientists say wild birds have carried the
virus to the Black Sea region from east Asia. Despite the spread of
human infections in Turkey, Bulgaria said the greatest risk came
from birds still moving south from the Danube delta, Europe's largest wetlands.
"For now, our expectation is that if bird flu appears, it would be
caused by the flight of migratory birds coming from the north around
the Black Sea," Agriculture Minister Nihat Kabil told reporters.
Following reports of unwillingness to report outbreaks in poultry in
other countries, Bulgaria said it would pay farmers twice the market
value of their domestic birds in the event they had to be culled.
Romania's agriculture ministry said it had intensified surveillance
on birds and domestic animals around affected areas and was
monitoring people entering and leaving the country.
Many countries bordering Turkey urged people to keep away from birds
and wash their hands to prevent infection. Officials in Armenia and
Britain asked travellers to avoid areas in the country where
outbreaks had occurred. "I don't think it would be advisable to
travel to the eastern parts of Turkey or to enter parts of known
infection," Professor Colin Blakemore, the chief of Britain's
Medical Research Council, told the BBC.
Iran has imposed tight controls on its border with Turkey, banning
one-day trips to Turkey from its Bazargan border area. It has also
joined the rest of Turkey's neighbours in banning its poultry
imports, raising concern among the public.

Snow and freezing temperatures in Turkey are hindering efforts to
halt a deadly outbreak of bird flu, the world animal health
organisation (OIE) said on Tuesday. "The OIE is particularly
concerned about the very bad weather conditions in eastern Turkey
that make any technical intervention very difficult and that also
favour a longer survival of the animal virus in the environment," the
OIE said in a statement.
The Paris-based OIE said poultry vaccination should be considered in
Turkey and urged the international community to support efforts to
halt the outbreak. It also called on Turkey's neighbours to
increase their defences against the disease. "Neighbouring countries
may also be susceptible to AI (Avian Influenza) outbreaks and should
therefore increase their levels of surveillance," it said.
The OIE's recommended response to outbreaks among birds involves
rapid detection, followed by quarantine measures, movement controls
and culling. Poultry vaccination is advised under certain conditions.
The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has already killed 3 children in
eastern Turkey, the 1st human deaths from bird flu outside China and
southeast Asia. The U.N. World Health Organisation said the victims
appeared to have caught the virus directly from infected birds, as
has been happening in southeast Asia, and not from other people. The
authorities have culled thousands of poultry around Dogubayazit, the
home village of the dead children in eastern Turkey, and said the
evidence there pointed to infection from diseased chickens.

The outbreak has cast a cloud over Turkish celebrations of the Muslim
Eid al-Adha festival, a major national holiday. Snow and freezing
temperatures in the east of the country are also hampering efforts to
tackle the virus and may be allowing it to survive longer.
The authorities have sent teams of veterinarians in protective white
body suits to a number of regions to cull poultry, seen as the best
method of checking the disease. The mayor of the eastern village of
Dogubayazit, home to the children who died, said many people were
hiding their poultry because they did not believe government promises
that they would be fully compensated. "Many lie to officials and when
vets go to a particular house the wife does not give them up," Rauf
Ulusoy told Reuters. "We can force them to hand over poultry under
the law, but we are not using that method right now. We ask kindly," he said.
Parts of suburbs of the capital Ankara and the business hub Istanbul
have been sealed off for the culling of poultry. Inhabitants leaving
the areas have been disinfected.

With all 14 confirmed avian flu cases in Turkey contracted from
infected birds, containing the outbreaks of the highly contagious
infection among fowl became the national priority on Tuesday. "All of
the cases confirmed by the laboratory are people who had close
contact with infected, sick or dead poultry. The major point now is
to control the outbreak in poultry as it is the source of infection
in humans," Guenael Rodier, a senior specialist for communicable
diseases with the World Health Organization (WHO), said from the
eastern Turkish city of Van.
The Turkish government said it was taking the threat of avian flu
very seriously and had already culled more than 300 000 birds, mainly
in the east of the country, where the first human infections were
reported last week. "We are still evaluating the situation but we are
serious about a regional or even national cull of all birds outside
commercial premises," Nihat Bakdil, Deputy Secretary of State in the
Ministry of Agriculture, told IRIN in the capital, Ankara.
Turkish authorities have started an urgent awareness-raising campaign
in an effort to get the message across via newspapers, television and
radio, urging the population to follow basic hygiene norms to avoid
the infection. Further long-term measures are being sought to stem
the killer disease. The agriculture ministry is expected to submit an
urgent proposal to parliament to ban the keeping of all backyard
poultry in the country.
Recep Akdag, the Turkish health minister visiting Van, where the 1st
human bird flu cases were reported over a week ago, said to the
Turkish Hurriyet newspaper on Tuesday: "Our people should definitely
abandon backyard poultry. From now on, the notion of backyard eggs
should be history." For many rural households in Turkey,
particularly in its eastern parts where poverty and a lack of
development remain major issues, backyard fowl are a key source of livelihood.
