The daily "Haaretz" newspaper published on 9 Feb 2006 an article on
Hepatotoxicosis in dogs. According to the item, 2 additional batches [of
dog food] are suspected and should not be used, namely DPA 1001 GA
11GDS1309 (blue bags) and DMD 120 7C 11GJLO240 (green bags). The
distributor, which earlier withdrew from the shelves the incriminated batch
DPA1001GA11GDS1309 (green bags), denies the possible involvement of the
additional batches.
Reportedly, at least 5 dogs that consumed the recalled batch (green bags)
have died during the recent weeks; 20 are currently hospitalized and
treated at the Teaching Hospital of the Koret School of Veterinary
Medicine, the Hebrew University.
It was reported by the Koret Veterinary Teaching Hospital at Beit-Dagan
that all dogs being cared for had consumed the same contaminated batch of
food and had similar clinical signs, particularly hemorrhagic enteritis,
emesis, and liver dysfunction. Prof Hylton Bark, the director of the
hospital, added that though the toxin could not yet be detected in the
affected dogs, clearly they showed the same symptoms as recently described
in about 100 dogs in the USA, attributed to the consumption of the same
product.
