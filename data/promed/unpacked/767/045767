Veterinary officers have called for emergency pet vaccination in the Ashanti Region following the death of 4 children this year [2013] from rabies at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. The children were aged between 5 and 6 years. The Director of the Veterinary Services in the region, Dr Kofi Quansah-Forson, warns more people are likely to die from the disease because the last mass vaccination campaign in the region happened a decade ago. Dr Quansah-Forson told Luv FM's Erastus Asare Donkor that last year [2012], 12 people also died of rabies infections in the region. "We believe these people would not have lost their lives if the government and stakeholders had supported or found money for the veterinary service to undertake a coordinated rabies vaccination throughout the region," he told Erastus.

Vaccination of pets is voluntary; hence only a few people undertake regular tests or vaccinate their pets regularly. Dr Quansah-Forson says that the bad attitude toward pet vaccination by pet owners holds a "hidden danger" that needs immediate action. Last year [2012], veterinary clinics recorded only 476 cases of dog bites, with 14 of the pets involved testing positive for rabies, Dr Quansah-Forson revealed. He said the upsurge of reported cases of dog bites at their offices is alarming. "Between January to August this year [2013], 210 people are on record to have been bitten by dogs in the region," he revealed. He observed that Ghana's efforts at controlling child mortality and control of emerging diseases is being threatened by the increasing deaths from rabies. "A death from rabies which is a preventable disease is unpardonable," he stressed. He recommended a mass vaccination campaign to end the trend.

Rabies is transmitted from animals to humans, and it is caused by a virus. It is known to be present in more than 150 countries and territories of all continents except Antarctica. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), about 60 000 people, mostly in Asia and Africa, die of rabies every year. Rabies virus infects domestic and wild animals and is spread to people through close contact with infected animals' saliva via bites or scratches. The main route of rabies transmission to humans is the bite of rabid dogs.

[Two people (in this instance adults) died from a rabies outbreak in the Asunafo North and Asunafo South Districts in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana between February and April this year (2013). At that time the Regional Director of Veterinary Services appealed to the general public to ensure their pets, especially dogs and cats, were vaccinated annually against the disease to avert any future occurrences. He advised people who are bitten by dogs or cats to rush to the nearest hospital for vaccination and careful examination to save their lives, and explained that the 2 people died because they reported to the hospital late.

Dr Gbeddy revealed at that time that the veterinary sponsored programmes by the Municipal and District Assemblies had stopped due to lack of funds and were no longer undertaking surveillance or monitoring in rural areas to vaccinate animals free of charge. He pointed out that stray dogs in the communities were dangerous and should be captured and killed under the assemblies' bylaws, and noted that people were dying because of non-enforcement of the bylaws.
