New outbreaks (16)
[For the respective detailed information on each of the new outbreaks covered in this follow-up report, please refer to the source URL.

The 16 outbreaks started between 1 and 25 Dec 2012 in 5 grazing beef cattle herds and 11 housed dairy cattle farms, located in the subdistricts Golan, Tsefat, and Kinneret, all in Hazafon (North) district. - Mod.AS]

Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 16
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 6189 / 125 / 2 / 31 / 0

Epidemiological comments: The disease continues to spread towards the south and west of the index outbreak. Lately, some dairy herds have been affected (small number of animals). Modified stamping out has been practiced in these herds (euthanasia of the symptomatic animals). It seems that in this season the vectors prefer warmer stables (dairy) than opened cooler and windy areas (beef).

Control measures
Measures applied: control of arthropods, quarantine, movement control inside the country, screening, dipping/spraying, modified stamping out

Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s):
Administrative division / Species / Total vaccinated / Details
Hazafon / Cattle / 44 136 / Sheep pox vaccine (Jovac)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Virology Laboratory, Kimron Veterinary Institute (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 11 Dec 2012 / Positive

[An interactive map, showing the 16 outbreaks described in the above report, is available at the source URL. For a map showing all LSD outbreaks accumulated since the start of the epizootic in 2012, see http://tinyurl.com/cgmq5zx.

During less than 5 months, the disease has spread from few foci recorded in the northern Golan, adjacent to the Syrian/Lebanese borders, now covering areas in 3 subdistricts within the Hazafon (Northern) district, since the Zefat and Kinneret subdistricts have been added to the infected zone. The number of dairy farms affected by LSD has been increasing since the beginning of the rainy season, in spite of decreasing temperatures (which, however, have not yet declined beyond 5-15 C). The disease is threatening to advance further within Hazafon district, into the subdistricts Jezreel and Acre, where numerous dairy operations are situated.

According to the figures provided in Israel's follow-up reports to the OIE, the number of vaccinated cattle (44 136) has remained unchanged since 19 Sep 2012. In view of the continuous spread of the disease and the risk of its becoming endemic, vaccinations in additional regions will have to be considered. It will be interesting to note if the efficacy of the applied (JOVAC sheep pox) vaccine in protecting Israel's highly susceptible dairy cattle has been experimentally or otherwise established.

So far, 55 outbreaks have been officially reported to the OIE. - Mod.AS]
