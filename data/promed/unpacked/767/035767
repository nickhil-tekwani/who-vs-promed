German dioxin incident: state of play and measures (13 Jan 2011)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Dioxin belongs to the group of toxic substances which are monitored in the
framework of several coordinated control programs in Germany. Minimization
strategies have led to a significant decrease of dioxin concentrations in
food and feed during the last years. Further information can be found on
<http://www.bvl.bund.de/cln_027/nn_518594/EN/01__Food/05__LM__Monitoring__en/LM__Monitoring__EN__node.html__nnn=true>.

More general information about food and feed safety, including the actual
dioxin incident are available from the Federal Institute for Risk
assessment, <http://www.bfr.bund.de>, the Federal Office for Consumer
Protection and Food Safety, <http://www.bvl.bund.de>, and the Federal
Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, <http://www.bmelv.de>.

Furthermore feed producers in Germany are legally obliged to monitor for
dioxin on their own initiative. This self checking of a compound feed
producer revealed analytical findings of dioxin on 21 Dec 2010; the
competent authority was informed on 22 Dec 2010. The 1st message in the
Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) issued on 27 Dec 2010 referred
to one consignment (26 tonnes) of contaminated fatty acids getting mixed
with 500 tonnes of vegetable feed fat.

The authorities started official tracing back and revealed as source
contaminated fat which was originally destined for technical purposes, but
illegally mixed with feed fat in one feed fat producing company in Germany.
By way of precaution, pending the outcome of further dioxin analyses, all
feed fat produced at this feed fat company from 11 Nov 2010 onwards was
considered as being possibly contaminated.

Therefore the authorities started tracing forward and identified all
compound feed producers which have been supplied with the contaminated feed
fat. It is assumed to contain a 2 to 10 per cent share of contaminated fat.
Analysis of compound feed produced with contaminated feed fat indicated a
contamination level of 1.1 to 1.5 ng WHO- PCDD/F-TEQ /kg product. (The EU
maximum level is 0.75 ng/kg product.)

Further detailed tracing forward led the authorities to about 4800
agricultural holdings being listed as possible customers of the potentially
contaminated compound feed. They are located in 5 of the 16 German Laender,
Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia being mainly concerned.
Consequently all these holdings were immediately blocked as a wide-scale
precautionary measure.

The authorities lift the ban only if it is proved that feed or products --
especially eggs and meat -- do not contain higher levels of dioxin than
permitted by EU law. The regulatory actions are based on individual risk
assessments comprising the analysis of reserve samples, of feeding stuffs
and of food as well as on the calculation of the dioxin levels of feed
batches already consumed. By these measures most of the bans could be
lifted in the meantime.

In any case, contaminated food products are withdrawn from the market.
Currently 490 agricultural holdings are still under restriction. They are
not allowed to put their animals and animal products on the market or to
export them. With respect to pork, up to now, critical dioxin levels were
detected on 2 of these holdings. Products (eggs and meat) from contaminated
animals are traced back and destroyed, to make sure that the food chain is
not getting affected.
