First record of barley yellow dwarf and cereal yellow dwarf viruses in Tunisia
-----------------------------------
KM Makkouk (<k.makkouk@cgiar.org>, Virology Laboratory, Germplasm Program,
ICARDA. PO Box 5466, Aleppo, Syria); A Najar (National Institute of
Agricultural Research (INRAT), Tunis, Tunisia); SG Kumari (Virology
Laboratory, Germplasm Program, ICARDA. PO Box 5466, Aleppo, Syria).
Accepted for publication 13/06/2001
A survey for barley yellow dwarf (BYDV) and cereal yellow dwarf viruses
(CYDV) was carried out during April 2001 covering 7 major cereal-growing
regions (Beja, Bizerte, Cap-Bon, Jendouba, Le Kef, Siliana, and Zaghouan)
of Tunisia. 1650 samples (466 barley, 765 durum wheat, and 419 bread wheat)
with yellowing, stunting, or striping were collected from 12 barley, 23
durum wheat, and 13 bread wheat fields. These samples were tested at the
Virology Laboratory, ICARDA, Aleppo, Syria, for the presence of 5 viruses
by the tissue-blot immunoassay (Makkouk and Comeau, 1994), using a battery
of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Specific rabbit polyclonal
antisera were used for BYDV-PAV (genus Luteovirus, family Luteoviridae),
BYDV-SGV and BYDV-RMV (family Luteoviridae); all provided by R. Lister,
Purdue University, USA (Webby and Lister, 1992; Webby et al, 1993). In
addition, 2 specific monoclonal antibodies for the detection of CYDV-RPV
(genus Polerovirus, family Luteoviridae) (ATCC PVAS-669) and BYDV-MAV
(genus Luteovirus, family Luteoviridae) (ATCC PVAS-673) were used.
Serological tests showed that [the 5 viruses were [present in all of the 7
regions surveyed. Among the viruses detected, BYDV-PAV was the commonest,
being detected in 377 cereal samples out of 1650 tested (22.8%), followed
by BYDV-SGV (17.2%), BYDV-RMV (5.5%), BYDV-MAV (1.1%), and CYDV-RPV (0.7%).
The occurrence of the 5 viruses was higher (75.3%) in barley than in wheat
(36%). Mixed infections of 2 or more viruses were found in all the regions
surveyed.
Even though BYDV-PAV [was identified earlier (Najar et al, 2000), this is
the first report on identification and relative occurrence of all barley
yellow dwarf and cereal yellow dwarf viruses in Tunisia.

[BYDV was first reported in 1951 in California in oats (_Avena sativa_),
barley (_Hordeum vulgare_), and wheat (_Triticum aestivum_). There are 6
cereal-infecting viruses in the Luteoviridae, 2 (BYDV-MAV and BYDV-PAV) in
the genus Luteovirus, and 1 (CYDV-RPV) in the genus Polerovirus. 3 other
viruses (BYDV-GPV, BYDV-RMV and BYDV-SGV) are unassigned species in the
family. Luteoviruses and Poleroviruses are transmitted by several aphid
vectors that exhibit specificity of transmission.
Cereal diseases caused by BYDV and CYDV are widely distributed and are
probably the most damaging viruses that infect cereals. Yield losses vary,
depending upon field conditions, cultivar, and climate, but can range up to
100 per cent crop loss, especially if plants are infected early in their
growth. Viral species are determined by vector specificity, serology,
genomic sequence, host range, and virulence. Disease management options
include use of resistant or tolerant cereal cultivars, planting as early as
possible to avoid vector populations, and use of specific insecticides.
An online abstract of Reference 2 above provides information on other
cereal viruses including barley stripe mosaic, barley yellow striate
mosaic, and wheat dwarf viruses in Tunisia.
