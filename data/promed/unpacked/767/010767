Outbreak of mumps in Toronto - Canada (Ontario)
-----------------------------------------------
Toronto Public Health reports 11 cases of mumps (10 confirmed and 1
probable) since 20 Jul 2011. The index case for this cluster travelled
from Vancouver (where a mumps outbreak that started in Whistler [see
ProMED-mail references below] has recently spread) to Toronto on 3 Jun
2011 and developed symptoms on 9 Jun 2011. Transmission was initially
confined to employees and patrons at the Toronto financial district
restaurant where the index case worked, but has now spread to other
sites. Currently, all confirmed cases have some link (work, meeting,
or other activities) to the downtown financial core of Toronto. A
small number of other cases linked to this outbreak have also been
reported from other health units within Ontario.

The median age of the 11 cases is 34 years, with a range of 24 to 47
years; 73 per cent of cases are male. One case had received 2 doses of
mumps-containing vaccine, 3 cases had received a single dose, and the
rest had an unknown vaccination history. Reports continue to be
received and investigated. Genotyping of all lab-confirmed cases is
pending.

Toronto Public Health's response has included: 1) a vaccine clinic for
employees of the restaurant, 2) 2 public health alerts to assist
clinicians with diagnosing mumps and infection prevention and control
measures for their office, 3) promotion of vaccine messages through
media outlets, and 4) the exclusion from work of susceptible employees
in a high risk setting (for example, health care workers) for the
period 12 to 26 days following their exposure.

One other confirmed case of mumps also travelled to Vancouver during
their period of acquisition and was reported before this outbreak.
There was no evidence of any further transmission from this case.

official update.

These observations indicate that, whereas the mumps virus component of
the MMR triple vaccine may be adequate to eliminate infection at the
community level, not all individuals may be protected against
re-exposure.

Recently SL Deeks and colleagues published "An assessment of mumps
vaccine effectiveness by dose during an outbreak in Canada" (CMAJ
2011; 183(9), June 14, http://www.cmaj.ca/content/183/9/1014. They
reported that vaccine effectiveness of one dose of the MMR vaccine
ranged from 49.2 per cent to 81.6 per cent, whereas vaccine
effectiveness of 2 doses ranged from 66.3 per cent to 88.0 per cent.
Assuming a vaccine effectiveness of 85 per cent for 2 doses of the
vaccine, vaccine coverage of 88.2 per cent and 98.0 per cent would be
needed to interrupt community transmission of mumps if the
corresponding reproductive values were 4 and 6.

Their estimates of vaccine effectiveness of one and 2 doses of
mumps-containing vaccine were consistent with the estimates that have
been reported in other outbreaks. Outbreaks occurring in Ontario and
elsewhere serve as a warning against complacency over vaccination
programmes.
