At least 11 kids have been sickened by _E. coli_ O157:H7 bacteria,
likely transmitted during field trips to the National Western Stock
Show in January 2009. There are 12 lab-confirmed cases and 8 others
are pending, according to Denver Public Health. Just one of the 12 is an adult.

So far, all confirmed and probable cases live in Front Range
counties, from Boulder to El Paso County, Denver Public Health
reports. The pattern of transmission suggests that some kids who went
to the stock show with their teachers contracted the bacteria, then
spread it at child-care, pre-school, or school settings.

Any child with diarrhea who attended the stock show should see a
doctor before returning to child-care, health officials said. And any
child with bloody diarrhea, whether or not he or she attended the
stock show, should see a doctor.

_E. coli_ O157:H7 infections can be very serious in young children
and in the worst cases lead to kidney failure.

Dr Chris Urbina, executive director of Denver Public Health, said
standards of cleanliness are set for stock shows and that the
National Western has always been good at complying. "Our people said
that there were these hand cleansers everywhere you looked at the
stock show," which ran 10 through 25 Jan 2009, Urbina said.

Children are allowed to pet animals at the stock show, and the mere
petting of animals whose hides are dirty is one way for the hand to
pick up the bacterium.

Investigators continue to talk to National Western officials and to
the children to better get a sense of how the bacteria was
transmitted, Urbina said. They'll ask sufferers what they ate, where
they went, what animals they petted, and so forth.

[Although a foodborne source is possible, this cluster of verotoxin
producing _E. coli_ is probably a petting zoo type outbreak.
