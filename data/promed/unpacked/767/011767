The State Health Secretariat of Rio Grande do Sul confirmed the 1st
death of the year [2009] due to a hantavirus [infection]. A man from
the city of Tatterdemalion contracted the disease and died this
Monday [16 Feb 2009]. A hantavirus [infection can cause] a disease,
caused [transmitted] by [virus in] air contaminated with urine and
feces of [virus infected] wild rodents, or even through its bite. The
symptoms are fever, headache and bodily pain, dry cough and shortness
of breath.

[Unfortunately, these reports in the popular press do not recognized
that there is a complex of different hantaviruses than can cause
human disease, leaving the reader with the impression that there is
just one involved in these cases. The suspected hantaviruses involved
in this and previously reported Brazilian cases last year (2008) are
not given in this or the previous reports. The ProMED-mail report of
cases in Brazil dated 23 Feb 2008 (ProMED-mail archive no.
20080223.07412) indicated that hantaviruses circulating in other
areas of Brazil (Mato Grosso) included: Laguna Negra, which has the
_Calomys callosus_ rodent host, and Castelo dos Sonhos which had
previously been found in Para state, but without a known host there.
Field research found that, in Mato Grosso, the rodent _Oligoryzomys
moojeni_ was the host of the Castelo dos Sonhos virus. A brief
description of other hantaviruses that occur in Brazil and their
rodent hosts is given in ProMED-mail archive no. 20080702.2020.

ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving further information about the
confirmation of the etiological agent involved in this case.
