2 more people have been admitted to hospital in the Indonesian capital on
suspicion of having contracted avian influenza virus.
"A 20 year old and a 12 month old were admitted separately in the early
hours of Wed 1 Mar 2006, both after the hospitals where they were being
treated suspected avian influenza," Sardikin Giriputro, the deputy chief of
Sulianti Saroso hospital, told AFP. This hospital is the country's main
center for the treatment of avian influenza, which has killed 20
Indonesians. The most recent fatality was confirmed last weekend.
Sardikin said 7 other patients were also being treated as suspected cases
at the hospital, after local tests cleared 2 more patients who were to be
discharged. Results of tests for the remainder were not yet in, he said. If
local tests return positive results for the H5N1 virus, the [samples] will
be sent abroad to a World Health Organisation-affiliated laboratory for
confirmation.
6 of Indonesia's 33 provinces where the virus has hit the most severely
have begun door-to-door checks on birds as authorities scurry to slow down
the escalating number of human cases here. Indonesia is offering farmers up
to 10 000 rupiah (1 USD) for each bird culled, but the sum has been
criticised for being too low, as the cheapest fresh chicken sold on the
market fetches around 15 000 rupiah. The compensation for birds such as
doves and quail has been set at just 2500 rupiah each. Although most of
Indonesia's human bird flu victims have come from Jakarta and its
surroundings, infected birds have been found in 26 provinces.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is concerned about a
suspected human case of H5N1 virus in Diyala governorate, some 65 km north
east of the capital. "This case is [has symptoms very similar to those] of
the 2 people killed by bird flu in northern Iraq last month, and we need to
urgently check this sample also because it's in an area far from the others
reported so far," said Naeema al-Gasser, WHO representative for Iraq.
Meanwhile, samples tested from 50 suspected patients in the northern city
of Sulaimaniyah and Missan governorate in the south were confirmed
negative, according to al-Gasser. The 2 fatal human cases of bird flu have
been reported so far in Raniyah, a village close to the Turkish border.
Those 2 deaths, of a 15 year old girl and her uncle, were both due to
contact with sick animals carrying the H5N1 virus, and were not transmitted
from one person to another.
The WHO official urged the government to compensate farmers for losses
incurred due to the mass culling of poultry. Since 15 Jan 2006, nearly 1.6
million birds have been killed by health officials in Sulaimaniyah and
Missan, with farmers expressing increasing discontent. "Most of the birds
killed were from small farms, whose owners depend on them for their daily
income," Al-Gasser said. "Urgent decisions should be taken to compensate
them to guarantee that they can continue to feed their families."
The northern Kurdish authorities quickly responded to the call for
compensation, recently adding another USD 3 million to the USD 5 million
initially allocated last week to reparations and preventive measures in
northern areas. Each farmer will receive a financial package based on the
value of birds lost.
"We have to spend from our local public funds because we haven't yet
received a response from the central government about the budget, and we
can't stop our programmes in Kurdistan," said Tahseen Nameek, deputy
minister of agriculture in the regional government. However, no such
initiative has been announced for farmers in the south.
The government in Baghdad responded by saying that the allocation of funds
was still under discussion, with a decision expected by Sunday. "We're
aware of the emergency situation, but a huge sum of money is required and
it isn't so easy to raise this quickly," said Ahmed Jalal, a senior
official in the Ministry of Health.

A woman has died of [suspected H5N1 avian influenza virus infection] in the
province around the town of Nassiriya in southern Iraq, the Iraqi
government said on Thu 2 Mar 2006. Further tests were being carried out in
Baghdad and Cairo, the government said.
Dr Ibtisam Aziz, a spokeswoman for the Higher Committee on Bird Flu in
Iraq, said that suspected cases in the Shula area of Baghdad are still
under medical care, with laboratory results yet to be received.
Other cases of infection from samples taken from 2 villages in Kefry, in
Dayala province, north east of Baghdad, have prompted the killing of
infected poultry and the sterilization of villages, Aziz said.
One other suspected patient in Dayala province was sent to the health
centre in Said Jabir village.
2 fatal cases of human bird flu -- in a teenage girl and her uncle in
February 2006 -- were previously confirmed in the northern province of
Sulaimaniya, close to the border with Turkey.

The 1st suspected avian influenza death in Pakistan has occurred at the
Doctor's Hospital, Johar Town, hospital sources told Daily Times on Tues
[28 Feb 2006].
The victim, his mother, and younger brother also allegedly died in a span
of 15 days, sources said, adding however that doctors at the hospital
concerned had not confirmed the patient's cause of death. The victim (a 27
year old man) had been attending his younger brother, said the victim's
family. He was brought from Gujranwala in serious condition 3 days ago and
was admitted to the Doctor's Hospital. He was put in a private room, but
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) by Dr Kamran Cheema
and Dr Sobia Qazi. He was kept in a separate room in the MICU and all
doctors and nurses concerned were handling the patient with gloves. Nobody
was allowed to meet the patient. There were also rumours that another
member of his family was being treated at Doctor's Hospital, sources told
Daily Times. The victim's family said Dr Cheema had told them that their
relative had died of the same virus his brother had died from. The family
took the victim's body back home, but left another family member at the
hospital [for further treatment].

[The occurrence of confirmed or suspected human cases of H5N1 avian
influenza has declined in some countries in East Asia, no doubt as a
consequence of improved surveillance and containment of disease in poultry.
No reports of new human cases of avian influenza have originated during the
past 3 months from Cambodia, Thailand (last date of onset 25 Nov 2005), or
Viet Nam (last date of onset 14 Nov 2005). No new cases have been reported
from Turkey since 5 Jan 2006. China and Indonesia, on the other hand, have
confirmed cases of human avian influenza as recently as 27 Feb 2006. Some
new countries with extensive outbreaks of disease in poultry, such as Egypt
and Nigeria, have yet to report cases of human disease. - Mod.CP]
