In an experiment designed to mimic events that could launch an influenza
pandemic, a synthetic influenza virus made by combining an H5N1 avian flu
virus with a human flu virus turned out to be no more contagious in an
animal model than the natural H5N1 virus, US scientists are reporting this
week. Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
made 2 hybrid viruses and infected ferrets with them, according to a report
to be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The
viruses failed to spread from infected ferrets to healthy ones in
neighboring cages. "We found that they [the viruses] were not able to
transmit efficiently," said CDC researcher Dr Jackie Katz, speaking at a
teleconference on 28 Jul 2006. "In fact, they were also not as able to
cause severe disease as the original H5N1 virus."
The deadly H5N1 virus has infected 232 people and killed 134 since late
2003, but it has not yet found a way to spread easily from person to
person. But scientists fear the virus could pick up that ability if it
combined, or reassorted, with a human flu virus, which could happen if
someone became infected with both types simultaneously. CDC set out to
create such a hybrid and test it in ferrets. The animals are considered
good models for flu virus research because their susceptibility to flu
viruses is similar to that of humans.
CDC officials cautioned against taking much comfort from the experimental
results. Although the synthetic hybrid didn't spread among the ferrets in
the experiments so far, that doesn't mean the scenario couldn't happen in
nature, they said. (Also, experts say the H5N1 virus could become
transmissible through accumulated small mutations, without reassortment.)
"These data do not mean that H5N1 cannot convert to be transmissible from
person to person; they mean it's probably not a simple process and more
than simple genetic exchanges are necessary," CDC director Dr Julie
Gerberding said at the teleconference.
The H5N1 virus used in the study was a strain collected in 1997, when the
pathogen first infected humans in Hong Kong. The human flu virus used in
the study was an H3N2 strain, which has been common in recent decades. The
research involved 4 steps, according to Katz. First, investigators assessed
whether the H3N2 and H5N1 viruses would spread in ferrets, whose cages were
arranged so that viruses could spread via respiratory droplets. The human
virus did spread efficiently, whereas the avian virus didn't, which
signaled that the ferrets were serving as good models for human infection,
Katz said. The next step was to generate reassortant viruses.
"We made 2 viruses that contained surface protein genes from the H5N1 virus
and internal genes from the human H3N2 virus," Katz said. "We found we
could make these viruses and that some of them were viable." Thirdly, the
scientists infected some ferrets with the hybrid viruses and waited to see
if they would spread to healthy ferrets. The hybrid viruses caused less
severe illness than the original H5N1 strain, and they failed to spread.
Finally, the investigators wanted to know if the hybrid viruses would
naturally mutate to become more transmissible if they were passed through
several ferrets in succession. So the researchers infected ferrets and,
after the ferrets showed symptoms, took nasal secretions and used them to
infect other ferrets, repeating this step 5 times. Further, the researchers
assessed whether the virus could spread more easily after all these
generations or "passages". "We found that the virus did not acquire any
additional capacity to transmit efficiently from infected ferrets to
healthy ferrets," Katz said.
Katz didn't explain why the CDC used a 1997 strain of H5N1 instead of a
more recent strain, but said more recent isolates will be used in further
experiments. Later versions of both H5N1 and H3N2 will be used to make
further hybrids for testing in ferrets, she said. Scientists have
identified a number of mutations in the H5N1 virus since 1997. "We did test
the more recent strains [of H5N1] for their ability to transmit, and like
the 1997 strains, they could not transmit efficiently from one animal to
the next," she said. "We need to continue to study this."
The CDC officials were asked whether reassortment "dumbs down" or weakens
the virus. Katz replied that the hybrids were less virulent than H5N1, but
cautioned that the results apply only to the 1997 strain. Gerberding
commented, "The pandemics of 1957 and 1968 were caused by reassortant
viruses. Those were not dumb viruses."
In answering other questions, Katz said some scientists believe the 1918
pandemic virus, unlike the 1957 and 1968 viruses, arose through slowly
accumulating mutations in an avian virus rather than through a reassortment
event. "We're looking at the approach of the 1957 and 1968 pandemics where
there was a more sudden change," she said.
The most important lesson of the research so far, according to Katz, is
"the knowledge that this process isn't simple, the procedure for the virus
to acquire the properties of transmissibility." She said the CDC also
created a hybrid that involved H3N2 virus surface proteins and H5N1
internal genes -- the reverse of the hybrid she first described -- and
"that was not sufficient for transmissibility either. That points to the
fact that it's a complex interaction of the surface genes and the internal
genes."
Gerberding warned that the findings shouldn't lead to complacency. "I'm not
reassured from the public health perspective," she said. "This virus is
still out there, it's still evolving, and influenza is always
unpredictable... So let's not use the word 'reassuring' with respect to
what might happen with H5N1." Because of the risk that the reassortant
viruses could spread, the research was done under stringent containment,
involving Biosafety Level 3 with extra precautions, Katz said.

[The following is the abstract of the paper by Taronna R Maines and 15
others, entitled "Lack of transmission of H5N1 avian-human reassortant
influenza viruses in a ferret model", which appeared in the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences USA, online version of 31 Jul 2006
[edited] <http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0605134103v1?etoc>.
"Avian influenza A H5N1 viruses continue to spread globally among birds,
resulting in occasional transmission of virus from infected poultry to
humans. Probable human-to-human transmission has been documented rarely,
but H5N1 viruses have not yet acquired the ability to transmit efficiently
among humans, an essential property of a pandemic virus. The pandemics of
1957 and 1968 were caused by avian-human reassortant influenza viruses that
had acquired human virus-like receptor binding properties. However, the
relative contribution of human internal protein genes or other molecular
changes to the efficient transmission of influenza viruses among humans
remains poorly understood. Here, we report on a comparative ferret model
that parallels the efficient transmission of H3N2 human viruses and the
poor transmission of H5N1 avian viruses in humans. In this model, an H3N2
reassortant virus with avian virus internal protein genes exhibited
efficient replication but inefficient transmission, whereas H5N1
reassortant viruses with 4 or 6 human virus internal protein genes
exhibited reduced replication and no transmission. These findings indicate
that the human virus H3N2 surface protein genes alone did not confer
efficient transmissibility and that acquisition of human virus internal
protein genes alone was insufficient for this 1997 H5N1 virus to develop
pandemic capabilities, even after serial passages in a mammalian host.
These results highlight the complexity of the genetic basis of influenza
virus transmissibility and suggest that H5N1 viruses may require further
adaptation to acquire this essential pandemic trait."
While this is a contrived and arbitrary experimental situation, it has
produced a significant result. Ferrets are highly susceptible to seasonal
human influenza A viruses and the result indicates that reassortment of
avian and human influenza viruses by itself is not sufficient to generate a
potentially pandemic virus. The genetic changes required to generate a
virus with pandemic potential remain largely undefined. - Mod.CP]
