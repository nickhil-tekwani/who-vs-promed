Biologists with NH [New Hampshire] Fish and Game are investigating the presence of 2 viruses that appear to be having an ugly effect on the local wild turkey population.

Ted Walski, a turkey biologist with NH Fish and Game, said biologists are looking into episodes where they believe wild turkeys in Newington may have been infected with the avian pox virus or the lymphoproliferative disease virus [LPDV].

Turkeys found last week were located near Fox Point Road in Newington, he said. Specimens from the dead turkeys have been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for further testing, he said.

"Not much is known about it," he said. "None of us know how long this may stay in the population."

Avian pox, which has been present in southern states for decades, causes turkeys to exhibit "lesions or develop wartlike, yellow, (pus-filled) protuberances around the neck/head area," according to NH Fish and Game. The growths can accumulate around the eyes and may also get into the throat, which causes the turkeys to have difficulty seeing and eating.

"The lesions block their eyes and go down their throat, so they can't see or eat the food they pick up off the ground," Walski said. "It also leaves them vulnerable to predators."

The LPDV virus, which has symptoms similar to avian pox, is relatively new in the Northeast, Walski said. The 1st case was reported in the United States in 2009. Unlike avian pox, however, LPDV often causes lumpy growths on the turkeys' feet.

Walski said both viruses are "bird specific," meaning they are generally only transmitted among the avian population. Both are typically spread by biting insects, but can also be passed by birds inhaling each other's dander, he said.

Walski said last year [2012], he recorded dead turkeys believed to have had the virus in 23 towns throughout the state.

Dover resident Jorden Cook contacted the Portsmouth Herald on Tuesday [10 Sep 2013] with pictures of a turkey in her back yard that appeared to have been afflicted with one of the viruses. Cook, a resident of Old Garrison Road, said she was looking out her kitchen window on Sunday [8 Sep 2013], when she noticed a turkey with the lesions she could only describe as "horrible" looking.

With her property located next to the Bellamy Wildlife Preserve, Cook said she is concerned that turkeys gathering on her lawn and eating from her feeder may be spreading the virus to one another. "We do get a lot of turkeys," she said.

Mark Ellingwood, wildlife division chief for NH Fish and Game, said any time turkeys are gathered together, it increases the chance of disease being passed on. "The close congregation of infected animals represents potential pathways for additional infection," he said. "This is a great opportunity to remind people [of] some of the perils of cordoning animals unnaturally around an artificial food source."

Ellingwood said his office get reports of turkeys with the symptoms periodically. He said residents who see the turkeys should not be alarmed.

*****"There's no known human implications regarding the virus," he said.

There are currently around 50 000 turkeys in the state, all of which are subject to periodic maladies or diseases, according to Ellingwood. "We're very interested in reports of it," he said.

[The lesions in the photo posted with the report (presumably from a case animal of this episode: http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=SO&Date=20130912&Category=NEWS&ArtNo=309120392&Ref=AR&MaxW=570&MaxH=370&border=0) look like lymphoproliferative disease (LPDV) rather than poxvirus. LPDV (Retroviridae), a previously exotic virus to the United States, has been identified in wild turkeys (_Meleagris gallopavo_) since 2009. Lymphoproliferative disease is a rare disease of turkeys that emerged in Europe and Israel. It is noteworthy that turkeys (_Meleagris_ spp.) are originally from North America. This emergence in the old world suggests that the virus jumped species and adapted to a new host in domestic turkeys in the old world, and then it was introduced to North America, where it spread to the wild turkey population.
