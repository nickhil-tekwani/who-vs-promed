A similar hepatitis B virus (HBV) outbreak occurred in 1997 in
Gujarat State, India, in the Mehasana district, which adjoins
Sabarkantha, the district experiencing the current outbreak (1). The
Mehasana outbreak involved a cluster of 15 cases of HBV infection,
with a case fatality rate of 46.7 percent (7/15 deaths). The median
age of cases was 35 years, and all cases were found negative for
markers of hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and
hepatitis E virus (HEV), although 3 cases were anti-hepatitis D virus
(HDV) positive, including 2 individuals that died. Through
epidemiological analysis, it was determined that the outbreak was
linked to the use of inadequately sterilized needles and syringes by
an unqualified medical practitioner. In order to better understand
the high mortality rate observed in both outbreaks, it is necessary
to investigate the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of the
outbreak HBV strains.

[ProMED-mail is indebted to Dr Osiowy for this informative response
to the request for information. History repeats itself and
surprisingly lessons were not learnt from the epidemiological
analysis of the earlier outbreak in the same region of the state of
Gujarat. We await the outcome of the investigation of the current
outbreak and in particular confirmation, or not, of the role of HDV
infection in affecting the severity of the transmitted disease.
