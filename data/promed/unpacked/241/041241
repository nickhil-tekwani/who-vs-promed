About 20 cows owned by villagers in Karisalpatti in Rediyarchathiran union in Dindigul district [Tamil Nadu state] have succumbed to a suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in the past week causing panic among the people, who are dependent on milch [milk] animals for their livelihood.

Dindigul district has about 30 000 cattle owned by its people and they are vaccinated free of cost twice a year by the department of animal husbandry.

A few days ago, S.A. of Sebestian Street in the village noticed his 2 cows looking sick, salivating at the mouth with blisters in the mouth and feet. The 2 animals died one after another, much to the family's disappointment. Similarly, L. who lives on the same street, lost 2 cows in the next 2 days. 3 animals owned by P. of North Street also succumbed one after another. This is in spite of the government having administered vaccines to the animals of this village a week ago.

J.A., a teacher, whose cow is breathing her last, says that he believes the vaccines were given a little late. "My aged mother is inconsolable now that my cow is sick and from the symptoms, we suspect the foot-and-mouth disease," he said. J.A. says that there are takers for the dead animals, ready at the doorstep as soon as the death is confirmed. "They offer us about Rs 3000 [about USD 56] for the cows we bought for Rs 40 000 [about USD 748]. But the heartbroken villagers are ready to give away the dead animals for nothing, on condition that the animals is taken far beyond the boundaries of the village to prevent the spread of the deadly disease," he said.

FMD is a highly contagious viral disease, requiring immediate action to quarantine the affected animals from the non-infected ones. It can spread through air and from humans when they handle the infected and healthy animals at the same time.

[The] husband of the Karisalpatti panchayat president Kulandai Terasu, said he believed that about 15 animals had died in the past week. Our village has about 400 cows, but now we have conducted 2 vaccination camps in the past week.

Chief veterinary doctor Ravichandran said that the death of so many animals was news to him and that only to the best of his knowledge only 2 calves had died. "But I will visit the village and find out," he said.

[Though FMD is endemic in India (including Tamil Nadu, where 15 outbreaks during 2011 were reported to the OIE), we find it appropriate to post the event for 2 main reasons:
1. Mortality of adult bovines due to FMD is rather exceptional. Generally, the disease is known to cause severe clinical signs and economical losses, but mortality rarely exceeds 10 percent. In young animals, mortality may reach much higher figures.
2. Reportedly, the affected animals went down in spite of earlier vaccination.

Information on the duration of the sickness prior to death, detailed timetable of the vaccination, the FMD virus serotypes included in the vaccine, and the identity of the causative pathogen, as well as results of the veterinary investigation, preferably to include PM findings and exclusion of other etiologies (including anthrax), is requested. - Mod.AS
