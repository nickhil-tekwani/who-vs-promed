The National Center for National Health announced the formation of a veterinary team to deal with news circulating about horses being exposed to respiratory diseases that lead to their death.

The center explained, through its Facebook page, that the Department of Veterinary Services has begun to assemble a team of veterinarians to visit the horse clubs and stables and begin the program of investigation to collect information and withdraw laboratory samples based on the reports received.

The center added that precautionary measures have been taken until the veterinary health situation is verified, including the temporary suspension of importation of horses and horse races and gatherings, until the epidemiological situation becomes clear and the veterinary team completes its work and assesses the health status of the equine herd.

The center called on the veterinarians who supervise clubs, stables, and clinics specialized in treating horses, horse breeders, and owners, to communicate and report any cases showing infectious symptoms.

[Respiratory diseases in horses are known to be caused by various pathogens. Several of them are included in WOAH's list, namely Equine rhinopneumonitis (infection with equid herpesvirus-1 and -4), equine influenza and equine viral arteritis. African Horse Sickness deserves to be included, in case its pulmonary form is suspected.

Other, non-listed infectious equine diseases may present respiratory signs as well. Equine rhinitis virus and Reovirus are ubiquitous viral respiratory pathogens.

ProMED would appreciate receiving any information on the event from knowledgeable sources in the area, including its geographical distribution, detailed clinical signs, duration of the clinical disease, morbidity and mortality rates, pathology findings, and, in particular, laboratory tests results. - Mod.AS
