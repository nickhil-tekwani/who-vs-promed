GAP Outlet, the discount arm of clothing retailer GAP Inc. has recalled 20
000 bottles of body lotion sold since 16 Aug 1999 because they may be
contaminated with _Burkholderia cepacia_, a bacterium that could pose a
health problem to infants and the elderly. The company said three types of
body lotion (sold as Om, Grass and Earth) are involved in the recall.
Although the bacterium should present no risk to a healthy person who uses
the products appropriately, immunocompromised persons could be at greater risk.
GAP said it has not received any customer reports of problems associated
with using the products, but was voluntarily recalling the lotion to limit
the risk of health problems. The three lotions, marketed in 18 ounce (510
gram) plastic bottles, are sold only at GAP Outlet's 114 stores, not GAP
brand stores. No other lotion is subject to the recall. The company said
customers should stop using the lotion and return it to any GAP Outlet
location for a full refund and a $10 gift card.

[_Burkholderia cepacia_ is a soil organism that is actually a complex of at
least 5 genomic variants that have been known for some time to frequently
colonize the respiratory tract of advanced stage cystic fibrosis patients.
Many clinicians have viewed colonization by _B. cepacia_ as predictive of
worsening disease course in these patients, although there is still some
controversy about the cause and effect relationship. It is clear that some
strains can cause life-threatening pneumonia in compromised persons.
Patients with neutropenia and cancer may also be at special risk.
Transposons carrying multiple antibiotic resistance markers are sometimes
present in _B. cepacia_ isolates, although we have no detailed
characterization of the strain(s) present as contaminants of the GAP body
lotions. - Mod.ES]
