The VP1 sequencing results of the recent foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus isolate from Daliyat Al-Karmel presents a higher than 99% similarity to the isolate from cattle in Tamra. The causative agent is O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2(QOM-15).

[The above information, which addresses ProMED-mail's RFI in 20190510.6462227, was circulated to district veterinary officers and shareholders on 15 May 2019; the date of its placing on the website is not available.

Most likely, the recent FMD event in free-ranging cattle in Daliyat-Al-Karmel/Isfia, reported to the OIE on 10 May 2019, is not a new introduction of the virus but presents the continuation of the event that had started in northern Israel on 5 Sep 2018. Tamra, mentioned in the above notification, is situated some 18 km (11 mi) from the current outbreak. The Tamra outbreak, involving calves in a free-ranging cattle herd, reportedly started 26 Jan 2019 and was resolved 17 Mar 2019. It was the 21st outbreak of the event. The current outbreak has become, in fact, the 22nd.

Israel's VSAH has recently reactivated the P3 laboratory of the Kimron Veterinary Institute at Beit-Dagan for the production of a limited quantity of a homologous vaccine against the circulating virus strain. - Mod.AS
