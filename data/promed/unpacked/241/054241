First animals are vaccinated against bluetongue
-----------------------------------------------
Cattle at Bixley Farms in Norfolk were today (1 May 2008) the 1st
animals in the country to be vaccinated against bluetongue serotype 8
[BTV-8] as over one million doses are delivered for animals in the
Protection Zone on the 1st day of the vaccine roll-out.

Under EU law, vaccination is only allowed in a Protection Zone and
Defra's (UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs)
vaccination roll-out plan sets out how the vaccine will be
distributed to ensure that those livestock most at risk are the 1st
to receive it.

Tim Cane, farm manager at Bixley Farms, comments: "bluetongue is a
particularly horrific disease and whether you are a smallholder with
a few animals or a farmer with a large commercial enterprise it's our
duty to ensure that as many sheep and cattle in the protection zone
as possible are vaccinated to help prevent the disease from
spreading."

Bluetongue -- don't hesitate, vaccinate: key considerations for
veterinary surgeons
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The veterinary profession is the corner stone of the bluetongue
vaccination programme with responsibility for vaccine delivery,
proper usage, and monitoring for efficacy. The vaccine is only
authorised for use inside Protection Zones (PZ).

The vaccine has provisional marketing authorisation and is classified
as a POM-V ["Prescription Only Medicine-Veterinarian"; according to
UK's Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2007, a veterinary medicinal
product classified as POM-V may only be supplied by a veterinary
surgeon or a pharmacist and must be supplied in accordance with a
prescription from a veterinary surgeon. - Mod.AS]

As such, the vaccine can only be prescribed to animals "under our
care" so you should
- satisfy yourself that your clients are competent to administer
vaccine, if appropriate;
- arrange any necessary visit(s) to check the livestock and premises
in order to satisfy the condition "under our care";
- ensure correct numbers of doses for numbers of stock.

Moving animals out of PZ
------------------------
Livestock keepers are allowed to administer the vaccine to their
animals. However, if the animals are vaccinated in order to be moved
out of a Protection Zone for the purposes of domestic or
intra-community trade, then a level of certification will be required.

Doses
-----
The vaccine is licensed for sheep and cattle. Vaccination will
consist of one dose in sheep and 2 doses in cattle given
approximately 3 weeks apart. Full protection is established 3 weeks
after the primary course.

Off-label use
-------------
If used in other ruminant species it should be administered under the
cascade system under the direct responsibility of a veterinary
surgeon. There will be no withdrawal periods if the vaccine is used
in goats.

This vaccine has not previously been used in the field. A clear line
of communication with farming clients is vital to report any
suspected lack of efficacy or other suspected adverse reactions
through the VMD's SARSS (Veterinary Medicines Directorate, Suspected
Adverse Reaction Surveillance Scheme).

Distribution and storage
------------------------
- the vaccine must be ordered responsibly. Obtaining the vaccine is
licensed and distribution of vaccine will be monitored; it is illegal
to order vaccine unless it is intended for immediate distribution to
animal keepers for immediate administration in the Protection Zone.
- your practice may find it useful to establish a list of clients and
the number of doses they need, preferably by County so that you can
ensure a fair and rapid delivery of vaccine as it becomes available.
- it is essential that the data sheet requirements for the storage
temperature be strictly adhered to at all times.

Massive vaccination on cattle began in northeastern France Fri 25 Apr
2008 with the Intervet vaccine (BTV-8). Farmers are officially not
permitted to vaccinate their own animals.

[The long-due BTV-8 vaccination is expected to commence soon also in
other severely affected European countries, such as Belgium,
Netherlands, and Luxembourg, where it is planned to cover their
entire territories, declared as Protection Zones (PZ). The situation
in other countries, such as the UK, Switzerland, the Czech Republic,
Denmark, Italy, and Spain is different, since only parts of their
territories have been declared PZ's where the vaccination is allowed.
It remains to see if vaccination, restricted to PZ's, will contribute
to the prevention of BTV-8 spreading to the other regions with
susceptible livestock.

For "The hows and whys of vaccination," go to

It will be useful to obtain detailed information on the safety and
efficacy tests, which the released inactivated BTV-8 vaccine has
undergone. - Mod.AS]
