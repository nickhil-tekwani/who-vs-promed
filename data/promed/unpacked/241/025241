Veterinary experts working for the European Commission have accused the
French authorities of not doing enough to halt the spread of BSE or "mad
cow disease" (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE).
The vets found traces of banned substances in feed-stuffs [wonder what the
substances were? and they criticized farmers for delays in reporting
suspected BSE cases. A commission spokesman stressed all systems have
failings and there was no suggestion from the commission that French beef
was unsafe.
But the French authorities will find these criticisms embarrassing in the
light of their refusal to allow imports of British beef, which is subject
to much more stringent controls.
European Commission vets issue regular reports on how countries are dealing
with the BSE crisis. This one suggests there are significant failings in
the French approach. In particular, it says notification of suspected new
cases of BSE by French farmers occurs only after a certain hesitation and,
in some cases, after a considerable delay. If the vets are right, there
must be at least a risk some BSE cases are being slaughtered for human
consumption.
There is also a risk of under-reporting of BSE, the report says, because
the French definitions of those animals which should be considered at risk
are too lax. In particular, the veterinary experts complain fallen stock is
not considered as suspect and is destroyed without the authorities being
notified.
They are also critical of the French controls on feed-stuffs. They suggest
some banned material is still being fed to cattle, in contravention of EU
rules.
