New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: A Coru√±a, Galicia
Date of start of the outbreak: 3 Jul 2019
Outbreak status: resolved on 10 Jul 2019
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 68 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 1.5 / 1.5 / 100 / 1.5
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: on [5 Jul 2019], the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Algete (National Reference Laboratory for TSEs, accredited under UNE-EN ISO/IEC 17025:2005 standard) received a nerve tissue sample suspected to be infected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) from the accredited Regional Laboratory for Animal Health in Lugo, Galicia (official regional laboratory), after a positive result was obtained through a HerdChek BSE-Scrapie Antigen Test Kit (Idexx Laboratories) rapid test. The National Reference Laboratory carried out the confirmation tests authorized according to EU Regulation no. 1148/2014. The selected combined tests were ELISA, carried out by the regional laboratory (HerdChek), and Prionics Check Western Blot, and positive results were obtained for both tests. Afterwards, tests for BSE strain discrimination were carried out through hybrid immunoblotting with antibodies against PrP, confirming atypical BSE (H type strain). The sample was taken within the national TSE surveillance program (sampling of dead or non-slaughtered for human consumption animals over 48 months old). The animal was a crossbred cow born [on 30 Jan 2001].

Control measures
Measures applied: traceability; official destruction of animals products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Central Veterinary Laboratory, Algete (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / Western blot / 10 Jul 2019 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

["Atypical BSE occurs rarely and spontaneously, typically in cattle that are 8 years old or older. There is no association of atypical BSE with contaminated feed or ingestion of infected materials. Instead, a spontaneous change in the prion proteins in older adult cattle causes atypical BSE. Because changes in prion proteins are sporadic and very rare, scientists do not fully understand what causes prions to change from normal to abnormal forms.

"Scientists are currently studying whether genetics or environmental factors may contribute to atypical BSE. As part of this research, scientists typically examine the offspring of animals diagnosed with atypical BSE and animals born in the same location at the same time as affected animals."

Cases of atypical BSE do not impact the official BSE risk status of a country, and, therefore, this detection will not change the negligible risk status of Spain. - Mod.CRD
