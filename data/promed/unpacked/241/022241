Cambodia: 3 more suspected human avian influenza cases
------------------------------------------------------
Three more people have been admitted to hospital in Cambodia with suspected
avian influenza 5 days after the country reported its 1st death from the
virus in a year, health officials said on Sat 25 Mar 2006.
The 3 -- one adult and 2 children -- are being treated for fever and
respiratory problems at a hospital in the capital Phnom Penh, said Ly
Sovann, head of the Health Ministry's Department of Infectious Diseases.
The suspected cases come from a village neighboring that of a 3 year old
girl who died on Tuesday [21 Mar 2006] after falling ill with the H5N1
strain of the virus. Five other people who had contact with the suspected
cases are also being tested, Ly Sovann said. It is unknown how the 3 might
have become infected with the H5N1 virus, Ly Sovann said.
Seven Cambodians thought to have caught bird flu after the girl died tested
negative for the virus, Ly Sovann said earlier. "All the 7 suspected
patients are negative ... all of them are better," he said. The 7, all from
the girl's village, fell ill with fever around the same time that the girl
died.
Officials with the health ministry and World Health Organization think the
toddler became infected after playing with sick chickens in Phum Prich
village in Kampong Speu province, 45 km (28 miles) west of the capital
Phnom Penh. Another 42 people from Phum Prich who came into contact with
the dead girl or the suspected cases have also tested negative for H5N1,
which has killed 5 people in Cambodia since 2003, Ly Sovann said.
Health officials are investigating the deaths of chickens and ducks in Phum
Prich, but an agriculture ministry official said on Sat 25 Mar 2006 that
there was no evidence yet the poultry died of H5N1 virus infection.
Cambodia's last outbreak of avian influenza in humans occurred in early
2005, while the virus has been found in ducks in eastern Kampong Cham
province twice since February 2006, triggering the slaughter of hundreds of
birds.
Thousands of birds smuggled in from neighboring Viet Nam, where 42 people
have died from bird flu since December 2004, have also been destroyed in
recent months. Most poultry in Cambodia is raised on small farms or in
backyards, making it difficult to prevent the spread of the virus.
