A total of 381 pigs from a hog farm in Yilan [Yunlin] County were culled after some of the pigs in the farm were confirmed to have contracted foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], according to county government officials on Sunday [28 Oct 2012].

The county's Animal and Plant Disease Center was notified on 23 Oct 2012 by a hog farm in Yuanshan Township that pigs at the farm have shown symptoms of FMD.

Samples collected from the farm showed that 144 out of a total of 888 pigs in the farm have tested positive for non-structural proteins, meaning they had contracted the disease before, according to the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine under the Council of Agriculture. Inspection officials are closely monitoring the situation at the farm.

Another nearby farm, with a total of 962 pigs, had 245 pigs test positive for foot-and-mouth disease, according to bureau officials.

The county's Animal and Plant Disease Center then culled a total 381 pigs from the 2nd farm that included the 245 that tested positive for the disease, bureau officials said.

The county's Animal and Plant Disease Center said it has sanitized both farms and all the farms within a 3-km radius of the 2 farms as well as vehicles used for transferring pigs.

As of now, the situation is under control as no other farms in the area have been found to have any signs of the disease, the center said.

Center officials also vaccinated all the animals in the farms against FMD, adding that it will closely monitor the situation.

[The outbreak, caused by FMDV serotype O, has been already duly reported to the OIE. The notification includes the following epidemiological comments:

"Two pig farms with suspected FMD cases were noted in I-Lan county by the local disease control center. Movement restrictions were conducted on these 2 pig farms; serum and swab samples were collected and sent to the national laboratory (Animal Health Research Institute). The laboratory results confirmed positive NSP antibody reaction in serum samples from 2 index farms. The pigs with lesions and others in the same pen in the farm of outbreak 2 were destroyed (total 381 head of pigs) according to the positive reaction of viral RNA product detected by RT-PCR. Virus isolation is underway. FMD vaccination and the cleaning and disinfection of the index farms were completed. The monitoring and epidemiological investigation of those surrounding farms that keep cloven-hoofed animals within a 3-km radius of the index farms had been completed. No clinical or epidemiological evidence of infection was found."
