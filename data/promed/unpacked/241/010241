Discovery of a hepatitis C-related virus in bats may reduce outbreaks
in humans
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viral hepatitis affects more than 500 million people worldwide and is
a cause of liver failure and liver cancer. While vaccines are
available for hepatitis A and B, this is not the case for hepatitis C,
which affects as much as 2 percent of the population in the US.
Scientists today are reporting discovery of a virus related to
hepatitis C in Asian bats, which may provide insights into the origins
of the hepatitis C virus and into the mechanisms by which infectious
diseases move from other species to humans. The full study findings
are published online in the publication PLoS Pathogens [The Abstract
and Authors' Summary are reproduced below. - Mod.CP]

Transmitted by blood transfusion or sexual intercourse, hepatitis C
[virus] is a common cause of liver failure. Viruses related to
hepatitis C, known as GB-viruses, have previously been found only in
primates. Now, using cutting-edge molecular techniques, an
international team of investigators has identified a GB-virus in
_Pteropus giganteus_ bats in Bangladesh. The work was completed at the
Center for Infection and Immunity (CII) at Columbia University's
Mailman School of Public Health, led by W Ian Lipkin, MD; the
International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research in Bangladesh; 454
Life Sciences, a Connecticut-based division of Roche Corporation; and
the Wildlife Trust in New York City. Using gene sequencing methods,
the investigators confirmed the viral genetic material in the serum of
five of 98 bats, and in the saliva of one, to be related to GB-virus A
and GB-virus C. Further analysis of the 2 identified strains,
tentatively named GBV-D, suggests that _P. giganteus_ bats are a
natural reservoir for this virus. According to the research team, the
fact that bat saliva can contain GBV-D nucleic acids provides a
biologically plausible mechanism for this agent to be transmitted from
infected bats to other hosts, including humans.

Bats are often important hosts for emerging infectious disease agents
with significant impact on human health including rabies virus,
ebolavirus, marburgvirus, hendravirus, nipahvirus, and SARS viruses.
Opportunities for transmission to humans are particularly prominent in
countries like Bangladesh, where people live in close association with
bats.

"This discovery underscores the importance of international programs
focused on microbe hunting in hot spots of emerging infectious
diseases," said Dr Ian Lipkin, John Snow Professor of Epidemiology and
director of the CII. "Finding this novel flavivirus in bats
significantly broadens the host range of GB-like agents and may
provide insights into the origins of hepatitis C virus," added Thomas
Briese, PhD, lead molecular biologist on the team and Mailman School
associate professor and associate director of CII.

"The Indian subcontinent and South Asia are areas where we are
ardently working to identify the next possible pandemic disease,"
stated Peter Daszak, President of Wildlife Trust. "Identification of
the natural reservoir of a virus, even if it may not directly infect
people, is critical to surveillance and reducing the risk of outbreaks
of infectious disease," noted Jonathan Epstein, associate vice
president of Conservation Medicine Programs at Wildlife Trust.

[The online PLoS Pathogens report referred to above is by Jonathan H
Epstein and 13 others and is entitled: "Identification of GBV-D, a
Novel GB-like Flavivirus from Old World Frugivorous Bats (_Pteropus
giganteus_) in Bangladesh." The full report is available at
<http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1000972>.

The Abstract reads:
"Bats are reservoirs for a wide range of zoonotic agents including
lyssa-, henipah-, SARS-like corona-, marburg-, ebola-, and
astroviruses. In an effort to survey for the presence of other
infectious agents, known and unknown, we screened sera from 16
_Pteropus giganteus_ bats from Faridpur, Bangladesh, using
high-throughput pyrosequencing. Sequence analyses indicated the
presence of a previously undescribed virus that has approximately 50
percent identity at the amino acid level to GB-virus A and C (GBV-A
and -C). Viral nucleic acid was present in 5 of 98 sera (5 percent)
from a single colony of free-ranging bats. Infection was not
associated with evidence of hepatitis or hepatic dysfunction.
Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this 1st GBV-like flavivirus
reported in bats constitutes a distinct species within the
_Flaviviridae_ family and is ancestral to the GBV-A and -C virus
clades."

The Authors' Summary reads:
"Bats are important reservoirs for emerging zoonotic viruses with
significant impact on human health including lyssaviruses,
filoviruses, henipahviruses and coronaviruses. Opportunities for
transmission to humans are particularly prominent in countries like
Bangladesh, where people live in close association with bats. Whereas
previous studies of bats have employed assays that test for known
pathogens, we present the 1st application of an unbiased molecular
approach to pathogen discovery in this reservoir for emerging zoonotic
disease. Unbiased pyrosequencing of serum from _Pteropus giganteus_
bats enabled identification of a novel flavivirus related to hepatitis
C and GB-viruses. Viral nucleic acid was present in 5 of 98 (5
percent) sera, and in the saliva of one animal. Sequence
identification of 2 strains of the virus, tentatively named GBV-D,
suggests _P. giganteus_ as a natural reservoir. Detection of viral
nucleic acid in saliva provides a plausible route for zoonotic
transmission. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that GBV-D is ancestral
to GBV-A and -C, and separate from the recently classified genus
_Hepacivirus_. Our findings provide new insight into the range of
known hosts for GB-like viruses and demonstrate the power of unbiased
sequencing to characterize the diversity of potentially zoonotic
pathogens carried by bats and other reservoirs."

In the current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)
classification the genus _Hepacivirus_ of the family _Flaviviridae_
consists of a single type species -- the human pathogen _ Hepatitis C
virus_. Additionally a group of related viruses GB-virus A and
GBA-like viruses is tentatively ranked as unassigned species. These
viruses have been detected in at least 6 species of New World monkeys,
but are not associated with hepatitis in these hosts. GB-virus B, a
virus of uncertain origin, can cause hepatitis in experimentally
infected monkeys. GB-virus C comprises a heterogenous group of viruses
of human origin transmitted by blood and blood products. The detection
and characterisation of GB-virus D in bats will precipitate a revision
of the taxonomy of the genus as well as extending knowledge of the
origin and transmission of hepatitis C type infection in humans.
