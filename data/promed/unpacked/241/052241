[1] Airborne transmission
Date: Sun 16 May 2021

A quiet revolution has permeated global health circles. Authorities have come to accept what many researchers have argued for over a year: The coronavirus can spread through the air.

That new acceptance, by the World Health Organization and the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, comes with concrete implications: Scientists are calling for ventilation systems to be overhauled like public water supplies were in the 1800s after fetid pipes were found to harbor cholera.

Cleaner indoor air won't just fight the pandemic, it will minimize the risk of catching flu and other respiratory infections that cost the U.S. more than USD 50 billion a year, researchers said in a study in the journal Science on [Fri 14 May 2021]. Avoiding these germs and their associated sickness and productivity losses would, therefore, offset the cost of upgrading ventilation and filtration in buildings.

"We are used to the fact that we have clean water coming from our taps," said Lidia Morawska, a distinguished professor in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, who led the study. Likewise, "we should expect clean, pollutant- and pathogen-free air" from indoor spaces, she said over Zoom.

The study's authors, comprising 39 scientists from 14 countries, are demanding universal recognition that infections can be prevented by improving indoor ventilation systems. They want the WHO to extend its indoor air quality guidelines to cover airborne pathogens, and for building ventilation standards to include higher airflow, filtration and disinfection rates, and monitors that enable the public to gauge the quality of the air they're breathing.

A "paradigm shift is needed on the scale that occurred when Chadwick's Sanitary Report in 1842 led the British government to encourage cities to organize clean water supplies and centralized sewage systems," they wrote. "No one takes responsibility for the air," Morawska said. "It's kind of accepted that the air could be of whatever quality -- containing viruses and pathogens."

SARS-CoV-2 multiplies in the respiratory tract, enabling it to spread in particles of varying sizes emitted from an infected person's nose and throat during breathing, speaking, singing, coughing and sneezing. The biggest particles, including visible spatters of spittle, fall fast, settling on the ground or nearby surfaces, whereas the tiniest -- aerosols invisible to the naked eye -- can be carried farther and stay aloft longer, depending on humidity, temperature and airflow.

It's these aerosol particles, which can linger for hours and travel indoors, that have have stoked controversy. "This cloud which stays around in the air, it may contain the virus."

What are the risks of Covid19's aerosol transmission? Professor Lidia Morawska explains.

Although airborne infections, like tuberculosis, measles and chickenpox are harder to trace than pathogens transmitted in tainted food and water, research over the past 16 months supports the role aerosols play in spreading the pandemic virus. That's led to official recommendations for public mask-wearing and other infection-control strategies. But, even those came after aerosol scientists lobbied for more-stringent measures to minimize risk.

Morawska and a colleague published an open letter backed by 239 scientists last July [2020] requesting authorities endorse additional precautions, such as increasing ventilation and avoiding recirculating potentially virus-laden air in buildings. WHO guidance has been amended at least twice since, though the Geneva-based organization maintains that the coronavirus spreads "mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, typically within 1 meter," or about 3 feet.

Morawska, who heads a WHO collaborating center on air quality and health, says that's an oversimplification. "There's nothing magic about this 1 meter," Morawska said. The closer to an infected person, the higher the concentration of infectious particles and the shorter the exposure time needed for infection to occur. "As you are moving away, the concentration decreases," she said. Infectious aerosols remain concentrated in the air longer in poorly ventilated, confined indoor spaces, according to Morawska.

Although a high density of people in such settings increases the number of people potentially exposed to an airborne infection, enclosed indoor areas that aren't crowded may also be hazardous -- a distinction Morawska says the WHO should make clearer. "The WHO, step by step, is modifying the language," she said.

Morawska, a Polish-born physicist who was previously a fellow of the International Atomic Energy Agency, can take credit for the WHO's changing stance, said Raina MacIntyre, professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. "Professor Morawska's contribution, on the background of world-leading expertise in aerosol science, made a real impact by forcing WHO's hand," MacIntyre said in an email.

The role of airborne transmission "has been denied for so long, partly because expert groups that advise government have not included engineers, aerosol scientists, occupational hygienists and multidisciplinary environmental health experts," MacIntyre wrote in The Conversation last week. "A false narrative dominated public discussion for over a year," she said. "This resulted in hygiene theater - scrubbing of hands and surfaces for little gain -- while the pandemic wreaked mass destruction on the world."

Some people working in infection prevention and control and related fields have stuck rigidly to beliefs that minimized aerosol transmission, despite evidence challenging their views because "they do not want to lose face," said Julian Tang, a clinical virologist and honorary associate professor in the department of respiratory sciences at England's University of Leicester. "We all have to adapt and progress as new data become available," Tang said. That's especially true in public health, where official policies and guidance based on "outdated and unsupported thinking and attitudes can cost lives," he said.

Morawska said she hopes the attention that the pandemic has drawn to face masks and the risks associated with inhaling someone else's exhaled breath will be a catalyst for cleaner indoor air. "If we don't do the things we are saying now, next time a pandemic comes, especially one caused by a respiratory pathogen, it will be the same," she said.

[3] NHS COVID-19 app
Date: Wed 12 May 2021

Ref. Wymant, C., Ferretti, L., Tsallis, D. et al. The epidemiological impact of the NHS COVID-19 App. Nature (2021). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03606-z

Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has seen digital contact tracing emerge around the world to help prevent spread of the disease. A mobile phone app records proximity events between app users, and when a user tests positive for COVID-19, their recent contacts can be notified instantly. Theoretical evidence has supported this new public health intervention (1-6), but its epidemiological impact has remained uncertain (7) . Here we investigated the impact of the NHS COVID-19 app for England and Wales, from its launch on 24 Sep 2020 through to the end of Dec 2020. It was used regularly by approximately 16.5 million users (28% of the total population), and sent approximately 1.7 million exposure notifications: 4.4 per index case consenting to contact tracing. We estimated that the fraction of app-notified individuals subsequently showing symptoms and testing positive (the secondary attack rate, SAR) was 6%, comparable to the SAR for manually traced close contacts. We estimated the number of cases averted by the app using 2 complementary approaches. Modelling based on the notifications and SAR gave 284 000 (108 000-- 450 000), and statistical comparison of matched neighbouring local authorities gave 594 000 (317 000--914 000). Roughly one case was averted for each case consenting to notification of their contacts. We estimated that for every percentage point increase in app users, the number of cases can be reduced by 0.8% (modelling) or 2.3% (statistical analysis). These findings provide evidence for continued development and deployment of such apps in populations that are awaiting full protection from vaccines.

Discussion
Our analysis suggests a large number of COVID-19 cases were averted by contact tracing via the NHS app, ranging from approximately 100 000 to 900 000 depending on methodological detail. The app is best understood as part of a system of non-pharmaceutical interventions, not in isolation (7). It is not a substitute for social distancing or face masks: control of the epidemic requires all available interventions to work together. Isolation and quarantine can only be effective when financially supported. All contact tracing requires case finding, and so is a follow up to effective, widespread and rapid testing. The specific role of digital tracing is to speed up tracing, and to reach more people per index case.

The surest ways to increase the effectiveness of the programme are to increase uptake, and to provide material support to individuals undergoing isolation and quarantine. Special efforts may be needed to reach underserved communities. That testing should be as fast as possible to help prevent transmission is well known. This could perhaps be facilitated by point-of-care antigen tests and integration of self-testing with the app, though this would need investigation to establish accuracy and usability. Widespread vaccination will eventually reduce the need for non-pharmaceutical interventions, but vaccination will unlikely have global reach within the coming months, during which time improved non-pharmaceutical interventions could still prevent many infections (24, 25). Smartphone use is already global, and thus privacy-preserving contact tracing apps should be further integrated into the public health toolkit.

[In the past 24 hours, India (281 860), Brazil (36 862), the USA (17 834), and Argentina (16 350), have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 9713 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 14 May 2021 to late 15 May 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (7 countries) include India, Brazil, the USA, Argentina, Colombia (15 093), France (13 948), Iran (11 291), and Turkey (10 512). A total of 41 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 20 of the 41 countries are from the European region, 6 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 14.4%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 4.2%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 23.1% decrease in daily reported cases and 5% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 500 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 163.70 million cumulative reported cases and over 3.39 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
