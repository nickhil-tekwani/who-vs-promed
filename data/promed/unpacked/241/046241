The Mobile County Health Department Confirmed [Fri 5 Sep 2014] a case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) [virus infection] in a human. The disease [virus] is spread through the interaction of mosquitoes and birds. Cases of humans beings infected are rare and health officials say the mortality rate is 33 per cent.

Mobile County Health officials said a 66-year-old Mobile County man has been hospitalized with a case of EEE [virus infection]. More common in horses, humans can be stricken if bitten by a mosquito carrying it. There is no cure or treatment for the disease. Doctors treat it symptomatically. "It's a swelling of the brain...an intense insult to the brain and it can result in a number of things including seizures and sometimes death," said Monica Knight, Director of the Bureau of Disease Control for the Mobile County Health Department.

EEE is one of the most severe mosquito-transmitted diseases in the country and county health officials are taking measures to monitor the situation and to eradicate infected [mosquito] populations. "We double and triple up on our mitigation activities. We spray more intensely. We spray more frequently so that we can hopefully abate the situation and not have anyone else exposed," Knight said.

In this case the person infected lives in Mobile County along Moffett Road. Officials have made personal visits to homes in the area to alert residents to the problem and advise them how to avoid being bitten. "They need to limit their outdoor activity during dusk and dawn which are the peak activity periods for mosquitoes," warned Director of Vector Services for the Mobile County Health Department, Jerry Folse. "They need to wear long sleeves, long pants, light colored, loose fitting clothing, wear repellents according to label directions, and also check around their property to make sure they don't have anything that will hold water and breed mosquitoes."

One of the ways the county monitors the spread of disease is through sentinel chickens. Right now they have 13 flocks spread out throughout the county. "The way it works is we have 4 chickens in a coop. We monitor 2 chickens one week, 2 chickens the next. We send the blood off for testing. We get the test results within the same week," Folse said. Those test flocks are placed strategically around the perimeter of the county and their locations are kept confidential. There are over 50 species of mosquitoes commonly found in our area [but only a small number of these species transmit EEE virus. - Mod.TY]

[The Gulf Coast area of the United States is endemic for EEE virus. Birds are the reservoir host, and the vector, the black-tailed mosquito _Culiseta melanura_, is the vector in swamps. Other species may be bridge vectors, carrying the virus out of swamp areas into adjoining localities, and transmitting the virus to humans and equine animals. Clinical cases in humans are very serious, with a case fatality rate of 33 per cent and significant neurological sequelae in survivors (see http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/). It is prudent to follow the recommendations above to avoid mosquito bites.

This is the 3rd ProMED-mail report of a human case in the USA this year (2014). It is odd that no mention is made concerning the results of the sentinel chicken program in the county, indicating whether or not some birds became infected before the human case occurred.
