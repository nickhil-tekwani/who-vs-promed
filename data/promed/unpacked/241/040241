Anthrax talks held
------------------
A group of Stanhope farmers met with DPI [Victoria Department of
Primary Industries] representatives last week to thrash out issues
over the recent anthrax outbreak in the district. Several farmers
have complained about potentially infected cattle being taken to the
Stanhope knackery [renderer] for destruction and also that the
department was not communicating as well as it should be with farmers
in the district.

Farmer Phil Serra hosted the Monday meeting of 6 farmers and said the
DPI had given a commitment that in future all anthrax-contaminated
stock, where practical, would be burnt on the farms where they died.
One infected cow was accidentally transported to the knackery where
it was kept on the back of a truck overnight and burnt the next day.
Dead calves from an infected property were also taken to the
knackery. Although anthrax cases are usually burnt where they died,
DPI said it was still possible that a small percentage of cases could
unintentionally end up at the knackery.

Mr Serra said farmers understood that undiagnosed cattle may end up
at the knackery, but they insisted that neighbouring farmers should
be notified when this happened. He said DPI gave them an assurance
this would happen. Farmers complained to DPI that DPI officers did
not deal with the knackery case until more than 12 hours after it
arrived. Mr Serra said they asked about having a vaccination zone
declared in the area after any outbreak requiring all cattle to be
vaccinated, but there was no commitment given to this. Mr Serra said
they were given an assurance that the Stanhope knackery trucks would
be progressively sealed to contain any fluids.

DPI animal standards manager Tony Britt, who attended the meeting,
said later [that] farmers were told that where possible, a carcase
affected by anthrax was incinerated as close as possible to where the
carcase was located when the diagnosis is made. Consistent with this
principle, during the recent incident, the carcase detected with
anthrax at the knackery was incinerated at the knackery. "The
preference of DPI is always to test a carcase for anthrax where the
animal died, and before the carcase is moved," Mr Britt said.

He said the meeting discussed issues relating to management of
anthrax cases. "DPI noted the importance of keeping people informed
during incidents, particularly those who live close to properties
affected by the disease."

Immediate neighbours to the knackery will be advised before carcases
are incinerated at the knackery, regardless of the reason for their
incineration. A DPI spokesperson said they were not planning to move
known infected cases to the knackery for destruction in future.

[We can all learn from this embarrassing series of events at the
Stanhope knackery:
(1) In an area where there is a history of anthrax, all unexpected
deaths should be promptly checked for anthrax at the farm/ranch
before the carcass is moved.
(2) Accidents will happen and anthrax cases will get missed and end
up for disposal at knackeries, which traditionally have been alert to
this risk.
(3) When you can, burn the carcasses where you find them -- don't
move them around unless you can be absolutely certain that there is
no fluid spillage. And
(4) warn the neighbours promptly so that they can vaccinate their
stiock. Any delay and you will be contributing to the lawyers pension
fund. - Mod.MHJ}
