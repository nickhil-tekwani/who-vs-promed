Epidemiology report published on H5N1 on Essex quarantine
---------------------------------------------------------
The epidemiology report on the case of highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) H5N1 in a quarantine facility in Essex has now been received from
the National Emergency Epidemiology Group and was published by DEFRA
(Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs) today.
The main findings of the report are:
1.Within the species documented as coming from Taiwan, only the Mesias were
infected with H5N1, and 53 out of 101 birds had died.
2.Infection with H5N1 was transmitted between the Mesias, but there is no
evidence of transmission to other species in the facility including the
sentinel birds.
The original identification of HPAI H5N1 on 21 Oct 2005 was made from a
pool of tissues derived from a Pionus Parrot (Surinam) and a Mesia
(Taiwan). It has not been possible to say whether the virus isolated came
from the parrot tissue or the mesia tissue or both. However, in the light
of the other evidence the balance of probabilities is that the source was
the Mesia sample. The H5N1 strain is most closely associated with a virus
isolated from ducks in China early in 2005. This is consistent with DEFRA's
working hypothesis of 23 Oct 2005 that the likeliest origin of the
infection was the birds from Taiwan.
The report sets out a reconciliation between the total numbers of birds
imported and their eventual fate based on the available evidence.
Investigations undertaken to date have not established any evidence of live
birds being removed from the facility during the period of quarantine.
Announcing the publication of the report, chief veterinary officer Debby
Reynolds said: "This report contains significant epidemiological findings
and helps to further our understanding of highly pathogenic avian
influenza. In particular, the apparent lack of transmission of H5N1 between
species in the facility will be of interest to the international community.
The available evidence points to the Mesias, which were documented as
imported from Taiwan, as the most likely source of the virus."
The facility had not been used since 9 Mar 2005. On 16 Sep 2005 a
consignment of 148 parrots (Caiques, Pionus, Macaws and Amazons)
[identified in the full report as: Black Headed Caique _Pionites
melanicephala_; Blue Headed Pionus _Pionus Menstruus_; 3 Macaw species --
Red Shoulder Macaw _Ara nobilis_, Blue & Gold Macaw _Ara ararauna_ & Green
winged macaw _Ara chloroptera_; 2 species of Amazons -- Yellow Headed
Amazon _Amazona ochrocephala_ & Orange Wing Amazon _Amazona amazonica_]
arrived from Surinam. On 28 Sep 2005, a consignment of 186 birds (Mynahs,
Mesias and Laughing Thrushes)[identified in the full report as Mynahs,
Mesias and Black Throat Laughing Thrush] documented as coming from Taiwan,
entered the facility. The 30-day quarantine period restarted with the
arrival of the birds from Taiwan.
A number of birds died within the quarantine period: these were either
submitted for testing, frozen or reported as incinerated. All remaining
live imported birds (234) and 4 sentinel chickens within the facility were
humanely destroyed on 21 Oct 2005. Essex County Council are continuing
their investigation into the events in the quarantine facility.
Margaret Beckett, secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs
announced a review of avian quarantine arrangements and procedures for
captive birds on 31 Oct 2005. The review will make recommendations on any
changes needed to policies or procedures in order to ensure that they are
as secure as possible.

[A full (9 page) copy of the report can be found at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2005//animalh/diseases/notifiable/disease/ai/index.htm>.
It includes, among other items, 2 tables with details on the numbers and
species of birds in each of the 2 discussed consignments, with dates of
fatalities, incinerations etc; a plan of the quarantine facility; and a
timeline of events.
The following points deserve attention:
1. The consignment from Taiwan arrived at Heathrow airport on 27 Sep 2005.
4 birds, dead on arrival, were not forwarded for examination. Details on a
veterinary inspection upon arrival are not provided, nor the flight route,
possible stopovers and/or contacts with other bird consignments under way.
Such scenarios, even if remote, should be excluded.
2. The said consignment arrived at the quarantine facility in Essex on 28
Sep 2005. According to this report the direct involvement of an OV
(Official Veterinarian), took place, throughout the period between
consignment's arrival in Essex and the 1st positive laboratory results (21
Oct 2005), on the following occasions: a visit on 29 Sep 2005; dead birds
brought by a keeper to the OV's practice on 14 Oct 2005 (arriving at lab on
18 Oct 2005); a visit on 20 Oct 2005.
Unfortunately, the report does not provide the scientific names of the
species included in the consignment from Taiwan. "Mesia" is vernacular for
the genus _Leiothrix_, of which there are 2 species: Silver-eared Mesia
(_Leiothrix argentauris_) and Red-billed Leiothrix (_Leiothrix lutea_).
It is of interest that Red-billed Leiothrix, smuggled by sea from mainland
China to Taiwan, were seized on 14 Oct 2005 by the Taiwanese authorities
and found infected with highly pathogenic H5N1. (see
<http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/174450/1/.html>).
The complexity and potential ramifications of such events are reflected by
the fact that the smuggled birds shared 96 per cent genetic homology with
the virus derived from yet another smuggled consignment of ducks in Kinmen
(just offshore of the Fujian province of China, but governed by Taiwan)
from China during the 2003 SARS period, and also shares 99 per cent
homology with the H5N1 virus currently circulating in Fujian (see
commentary in 20051022.3085).
The current UK (import) strain is, reportedly, similarly closely associated
with a virus isolated from ducks in China early in 2005. - Mod.AS]

Crucial treatment for a hospital employee exposed to Britain's 1st case of
avian influenza through his other job as a quarantine manager was delayed
by at least 3 days.
Officials at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)
appear not to have alerted local health authorities that the
quarantine/hospital employee urgently needed antiviral treatment. The
exposed man, who runs the quarantine centre where 2 infected parrots died,
approached senior staff at Southend Hospital after realising the potential
threat he posed of contracting and possibly passing on the disease. By
then, however, DEFRA had released an apparently false statement claiming
that all staff at the centre who came into contact with the birds which
were being held for a convicted tax fraudster, had received preventative
medication.
An inquiry has now been launched to discover how emergency plans were
ignored at a time when Sir Liam Donaldson, the government's chief medical
officer, was saying that 50 000 Britons could die if the virus entered the
human population. Oliver Letwin, the opposition environment spokesman,
said: "If true, this is yet another indication that the whole machinery is
not geared up to act with the speed and efficiency that would be absolutely
necessary to deal with a serious outbreak if one were to occur."
A spokesman for DEFRA said: "We have asked the State Veterinary Service to
undertake a thorough investigation of all the circumstances surrounding
this case. We can't prejudice that investigation by commenting on this issue."
The 1st parrot died on 16 Oct 2005 at the government-licensed site in
Ashingdon, Essex. DEFRA announced the following Friday that a case of bird
flu had been identified at a quarantine centre, but did not say where. It
stressed that the antiviral Tamiflu had already been given to staff "as a
precautionary measure". However, Southend Hospital said the exposed man was
only taken in for treatment the following day.
"He informed his managers at the hospital and he was taken to Broomfield
Hospital, near Chelmsford, which is the local distribution centre for
antivirals," said a spokesman. The exposed man's wife, who is a cleaning
supervisor at Southend Hospital, was also given the medication.
Under published DEFRA contingency plans, the local Primary Care Trust and
the Health Protection Agency should be notified as soon as a case of bird
flu is suspected or confirmed. Antivirals are to be administered as soon as
possible.

[There is no evidence to suggest that the quarantine manager/hospital
employee at the centre of this incident contracted avian influenza from the
infected birds (now thought to be finches from Taiwan) in his care. But
this episode does illustrate the formidable administrative challenges posed
by attempts to contain the spread of avian influenza in birds and its
spread to the human population in the event that a person-to-person
transmissible variant evolves. - Mod.CP]

On 14 Nov 2005, 3 more provinces reported bird flu outbreaks, bringing to
13 the number of provinces and cities hit by the epidemic.
The northern provinces of Bac Ninh and Hai Duong and the central province
of Quang Ngai discovered the disease on 14 Nov 2005, reported the
Veterinary Department under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development (MARD).
Meanwhile, after poultry stocks in An Hoa and Huong Dao villages in Tam
Duong district, Vinh Phuc province, tested positive to the disease, the
provincial veterinary department has immediately disinfected and isolated
the area.
In the northern province of Bac Giang, over 450 poultry head were found
dead in 7 farms on 13-14 Nov 2005, after the disease was temporarily
contained for some time. The entire poultry stocks of these farms were
immediately culled.
Amidst the spreading of bird flu, the National Steering Board for Bird Flu
Control is to set up another 9 delegations to inspect preventive and
control measures in those areas where the epidemic has broken out again,
said its Head Cao Duc Phat.

[4] China, mass poultry vaccination

China plans to vaccinate all 5 billion of its poultry against H5N1 bird
flu, amid news of 2 more outbreaks and continued uncertainty about human
cases in the country. The move will slow the spread of the virus and reduce
human exposure to it, but will also make any remaining virus hard to detect.
Jia Youling, China's chief veterinarian, told the official Chinese news
agency Xinhua on Tuesday that "China is trying to vaccinate all poultry
nationwide". He said the government would cover the costs.
At the moment China has 5.2 billion birds as livestock, Jia said, while
over the course of a year the nation produces 14 billion poultry. China is
the only country in Asia to practice widespread vaccination of poultry
against H5N1, but until now this has mainly been done by large-scale
producers, not by the millions of peasant farmers with backyard flocks.
[Indonesia is also officially applying mass vaccination of poultry in
commercial farms. - Mod.AS]
But after a year with only 2 reported outbreaks -- in far-flung Tibet and
Xinjiang -- China has now officially reported 6 outbreaks in poultry since
14 Oct 2005. These were across the country, in Inner Mongolia, Anhui,
Hunan, Liaoning and Hubei provinces. Then on Monday [14 Nov 2005] it
announced another in Anhui, and 2 in Xinjiang on Tuesday.
Officials have blamed outbreaks in Liaoning, where a woman is suspected of
contracting the disease, on the use of faulty or fake vaccines on poultry.
But it is known that the virus can persist and spread even in properly
vaccinated birds unless stringent precautions are taken. Some scientists
fear that bird flu in such poultry might undergo rapid mutation, as the
virus adapts to a resistant host with a different immune system from the
water birds it usually infects.
