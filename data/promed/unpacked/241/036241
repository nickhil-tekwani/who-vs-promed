Since May 2016, 9 confirmed cases of meningococcal disease among adult men have been reported in Southern California, including 1 death. This represents an increase above the typical number of reported cases. 6 of the cases are known to be caused by serogroup C, and an additional case is awaiting serogroup identification. 4 cases occurred among residents of LAC [Los Angeles County] (excluding Long Beach and Pasadena, which have their own health departments) with no associated deaths. The other 5 cases occurred in neighboring health jurisdictions. Most cases have occurred in the past 4 weeks. To date, public health investigation has not determined any common social linkages among LAC gay/MSM [men who have sex with men] cases with the other cases in the region. Based on these recent cases, LAC DPH [Department of Health] is reiterating its 2014 recommendation that gay/MSM who are HIV-positive or are at increased risk of IMD [invasive meningococcal disease] receive meningococcal vaccination (shown below). Additionally, on [22 Jun 2016], the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to recommend that all persons with HIV infection who are 2 months of age and older be routinely vaccinated with quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate (MCV4) vaccine, which protects against serogroup C, as well as serogroups A, W, and Y.

Table 1. Characteristics of IMD Cases: Los Angeles County, 2016
Year / Number Confirmed / Male / Female / Median Age / MSM / sg B / C / Y / W135 / Not Typed / Death
2016 / 9 / 6 / 3 / 36 (20-76) / 4 / 1 / 4 / 0 / 2 / 2 / 0
2015 / 12 / 7 / 5 / 48 (16-84) / 1 / 6 / 2 / 0 / 2 / 2 / 0

[In response to my query in the prior post on the outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in Southern California (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (CA) fatal, MSM, vaccination, RFI 20160626.4310203), as to what proportion of the 9 cases were men who have sex with men (MSM) or have HIV infection, what serotypes are involved, and whether molecular typing has been done on the current strains, an EpiCore member supplied the following from the report above:

According to the Los Angeles County (LAC) report above, since May 2016, 9 confirmed cases of meningococcal disease, including 1 death, among adult men have been reported in Southern California, which includes LAC plus at least 7 other counties; 6 of these cases are known to be caused by serogroup C. The Figure from the source URL shows 5 cases, although the text says only 4 cases, occurred in Los Angeles County (LAC) since May 1 2016, with no deaths. Also according to the LAC report above, in LAC since the beginning of the year [2016], there were 9 cases: 6 were male, 4 were MSM and 4 were serogroup C -- the Table, however, does not say if the 4 serogroup C cases were MSM.

Another anonymous EpiCore member pointed out that the LAC Department of Public Health reported in 2 Apr 2014 (http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/docs/MeningVaxRecsProvidersApril2014.pdf) that in the 1st 3 months of 2014 there was "a total of 8 IMD cases. Of these 8 cases, 4 cases were reported among MSM, including 3 men who were HIV‐positive. There have been 3 deaths, all occurring in MSM, 2 of whom were HIV‐positive."

Many thanks to the EpiCore members who supplied this information. - Mod.ML
