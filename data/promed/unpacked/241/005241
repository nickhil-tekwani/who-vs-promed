Isolates of Leishmania from patient infected in Iraq
----------------------------------
We would be interested in getting some isolates from Iraqi patients
with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) so that we can speciate them. We
reported VL due to _L. tropica_ in soldiers returning from Operation
Desert Storm and would like to follow up on this observation.

Leishmaniasis in Iraq
----------------
This report on leishmaniasis in Iraq [Leishmaniasis - Iraq: RFI
20030531.1331] is confusing and contains several mistakes. There is
no real outbreak of visceral leishmaniasis but an accumulation of
untreated cases. The transmission season is from May to October with
a major risk of transmission in September/October and, due to the
incubation time, cases are mainly detected from November to April.
Due to the pre-war situation and the lack of drugs during this
period, accumulated cases of transmission that occurred last year are
seen now. UNICEF and WHO have recently sent a large quantity of
drugs. _L. major_ and _L.tropica_ are the causes of zoonotic and
anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis, especially in central and
northern Iraq, but certainly not at the origin of visceral
leishmaniasis in Iraq.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Desjeux for his clarifying comments, which
raise doubt as to whether there is an increase in visceral
leishmaniasis in Iraq at all. Further information is requested, and
clinical data from physicians who treated cases are welcome. - Mod.EP]
