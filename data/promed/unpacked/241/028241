Livestock producers should consider changing their breeding programme to help mitigate the risk of contracting the Schmallenberg virus [SBV], scientists have advised. They said the disease had survived the winter and there was now a "real risk" of it spreading further north and across the border into Wales this coming breeding season.

"We have evidence that the virus is starting to circulate again now. I see no real barriers to it spreading quite quickly to a significant chunk of the country," Peter Mertens, disease expert at Surrey's Institute for Animal Health, told producers at the NFU's disease conference last week. Professor Mertens said a vaccine had been developed, but the licensing process could take a number of months so predicted it was unlikely to be available until December 2012. But he said farmers could reduce the damage from the midgeborne virus.

One of the measures farmers could take is to postpone tupping until after late autumn when temperatures drop, he said. "If the risk period of pregnancy occurs outside the midge season, there is a reduced chance of problems. "To transmit the virus, midges need 2 weeks to become infected and lay eggs. If you get high levels of frost, it kills the midges and re-starts the cycle," he explained.

The biggest risk period for foetal deformities in sheep is the 1st 25-60 days of pregnancy, while cattle have a longer and later risk period of between 62-173 days due to the increased gestation length. Professor Mertens admitted it was difficult for farmers to forecast the best breeding period, as weather conditions had become more unpredictable.

Prof Mertens said higher levels of malformation could be a result of grouped pregnancies and advised farmers to stagger pregnancy over a wider period to help spread the risk. During the last outbreak, less than one percent of farms were infected, with many only suffering from a low number of cases, he explained. There were one or 2 farms where it was higher than this, but this was due to synchronised pregnancies, where the whole farm was pregnant at the same time.

Prof Mertens said it was difficult to predict spread this time around, but weather would have a major effect on the spread of the disease in forthcoming months. "The weather is very important. It governs 1st of all when the midges arrive, how many we have got, and how rapidly the virus grows in the insects, and how it is spread." He said the geographical spread of the disease meant many farms would only be marginally protected.

Previously infected animals will have now built up antibodies against a 2nd attack, and the foetus will also be protected, but animals born after an outbreak could lose [maternal] protection and become susceptible later on in the year, he said.

Long term, he said there was a "good chance" the disease would burn itself out. "The UK is quite small, so I think we will get into a position -- providing the transmission rate is good -- where it will run out of things to infect." But Prof Mertens said producers could see the virus return at a later stage if this does happen. "In the UK, the turnover of livestock is quite quick at about 5 years. So once we have reached 100 per cent immunity, we are going to be back at square one, and the risk starts all over again."

However, it is hoped a vaccine will be available by next year [2013] to help combat the problem.

There is widespread concern that cases of the Schmallenberg virus (SBV) are being underreported by farmers. A European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) report, published in June [2012], said that mild clinical signs in adult animals were easily missed and as a result were going undetected.

The detection of SBV in the 8 affected European countries has largely been dependent on the detection of malformed newborns or still births, followed by the confirmation of the virus using scientific techniques. "However, estimates for the within-region force of the infection critically depend upon the level of under-ascertainment," the report read.

In northern Europe, the proportion of sheep holdings with confirmed SBV was 4 per cent a country and 7.6 per cent a region. But evidence from the Netherlands, France, and Germany showed the number of animals infected on a single farm had been as high as 70-100 per cent, the report revealed. This suggests disease incidence could also be higher in the UK.

Animal health expert Peter Mertens said: "It's very possible that on some of the farms where infection has occurred, the disease is likely to have gone unnoticed." He said this was because mild clinical signs such as fever, diarrhoea, and a drop in milk yield were more difficult to spot than birth defects. But he said it was "very important" for farmers to report such cases to help scientists build a more precise picture of the disease and predict a further spread.

Meanwhile, DEFRA is conducting sampling in counties not previously affected by SBV to discover how far the disease could have spread and is expected to publish the data on its website in due course.

The Institute of Virology and Immunoprophylaxis (IVI) has received, up to 12 Aug 2012, submissions from 67 farms in 18 different cantons related to notified abortions or foetal malformations. This included a total of 70 diagnosed animals: 33 cattle, 23 sheep, and 14 goats. So far, only one malformed calf tested positive for the Schmallenberg virus.

Acute cases in adult cattle with diarrhea and fever have recently been reported from 44 farms, 34 of which tested positive for SBV. The laboratory results have been based either on the detection of the virus or of specific antibodies.
