The illness that hospitalized a Snowville family of 5, killing 2, was not hantavirus as previously suspected, according to health officials.

Instead, it was a combination of 2 common and treatable illnesses, influenza type B and streptococcus Group A, that together claimed the lives of a woman and her 14-year-old daughter on 25 Apr 2014. Individually, neither the flu nor strep cause tremendous concern, but together they are "extremely, extremely rare and serious," New River Health District Director Molly O'Dell said. During a media teleconference on Wed 30 Apr 2014, O'Dell said both the flu and strep are circulating in the region, but there doesn't seem to be any threat to the community because it is so rare to become infected with both simultaneously.

The health department has not made an official cause of death finding -- that can come only from the medical examiner's office -- but health officials on the call talked about how the combination of flu and strep could be deadly. Doctors have not identified anyone else in the area who has been co-infected, O'Dell said.

No one in the family had received a flu shot, and all 5 members tested positive for the flu and showed signs of strep. It's impossible to know where they picked it up or whether they contracted both at the same time, O'Dell said. "A lot of times, what we'll say in medicine is just because you have one thing doesn't mean you can't have another, a 2nd thing," she said. "So if someone gets influenza, it certainly makes them more vulnerable to pick up bacterial infections."

The kind of co-infection that struck the family is so rare that it hasn't been studied by scientists, and only about 10 cases have ever been reported in all the medical literature that Tom Kerkering, Carilion's chief of infectious diseases, could find. "I've been doing infectious diseases for 35 years. This is the 1st time I've seen the combination," Kerkering said during the teleconference.

The family and Pulaski County's emergency services director previously suspected the family had contracted a hantavirus [infection], a rare and sometimes fatal virus passed to humans through rodent feces and urine. The women died about 2 weeks after they began cleaning out a mouse-infested mobile home that they planned to give to the family of a boyfriend who lives in a homeless shelter.

The rest of the family, the father, 2 younger children, and the boyfriend, were also hospitalized but recovered and were released.

[There is apparently no evidence that hantavirus was involved here, although the story is not inconsistent with the illness spread by aerosolization of virus in dried rodent urine.

To this moderator, the co-infection of influenza and streptococci is not at all rare. A discussion of the subject is found at:
Aebi T, Weisser M, Bucher E, et al: Co-infection of influenza B and streptococci causing severe pneumonia and septic shock in healthy women. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:308 doi:10.1186/1471-2334-10-308. - Mod.LL]

[Influenza virus infection is well known to predispose to secondary bacterial pneumonias and contribute to excess mortality observed during influenza epidemics. Some influenza epidemics have been more frequently complicated by secondary bacterial pneumonias than others. The majority of deaths in the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia (D.M. Morens, J.K. Taubenberger, A.S. Fauci. Predominant role of bacterial pneumonia as a cause of death in pandemic influenza: implications for pandemic influenza preparedness. J Infect Dis, 198 (2008), pp. 962-970).

Similarly, during the 1957-58 [H2N2] influenza pandemic, 70-80 percent of patients who died of influenza-related complications had bacterial pneumonia (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673658924048); whereas, severe or fatal cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza A were found to be less frequently complicated by bacterial infection (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971212000367).

_Streptococcus pneumoniae_ is usually the most common secondary bacterial pathogen to complicate influenza virus infection, although _Staphylococcus aureus_, Group A streptococci (GAS), and _Haemophilus influenzae_ have also been secondary bacterial pathogens. Reports of secondary bacterial infection with community-associated methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ strains have been increasing in recent years.

A synergistic relationship between influenza virus and bacteria has been demonstrated in animal models. For example, an otherwise nonlethal intranasal GAS infection when preceded by a nonlethal influenza A virus (IAV) infection was found to lead to lethal invasive GAS infections in 90 percent of mice (Okamoto S1, Kawabata S, Nakagawa I, et al. Influenza A virus-infected hosts boost an invasive type of _Streptococcus pyogenes_ infection in mice. J Virol. 2003 Apr;77(7):4104-12. Abstract available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12634369).
In this case, infection of lung alveolar epithelial cells by the influenza A virus resulted in attachment of GAS to influenza virus expressed on the alveolar cell surface and internalization of GAS.

Synergism has similarly been found in a mouse model for _S. pneumoniae_ (McCullers, JA, Rehg JE. Lethal synergism between influenza virus and _Streptococcus pneumoniae_: characterization of a mouse model and the role of platelet-activating factor receptor. J Infect Dis. 2002;186:341-350. Abstract available at: http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1086/341462?locale=en) and for _S. aureus_ (Lee M-H, Arrecubieta C, Martin FJ, et al. A postinfluenza model of _Staphylococcus aureus_ pneumonia. J Infect Dis. 2010; 201 (4): 508-515. Available at: http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/201/4/508.full).

The viral-bacterial interaction is likely complex and includes alterations of pulmonary physiology and host immune defenses, changes in expression of receptors to which bacteria adhere, and enhancement of the inflammatory process (McCullers JA. Insights into the Interaction between Influenza Virus and _Pneumococcus_. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 19(3): 571-582. Available at: http://cmr.asm.org/content/19/3/571.full.) - Mod.ML
