[Wednesday's] announcement of the decoding of the genomes of the most
dangerous malaria parasite, _Plasmodium falciparum_, and of the most
important mosquito which transmits it, _Anopheles gambiae_, signals a
turning point for global public health. "This is an extraordinary moment in
the history of science," said Carlos Morel, director of TDR, the Tropical
Disease Research program. "At last, the enormous power of modern technology
is penetrating the mysteries of an ancient disease, a disease which
continues to kill millions."
Malaria infects more than 300 million people every year, killing at least
one million of them. About 90 per cent of the deaths are in children under
5 years of age. And it's getting worse. Public health campaigns against
malaria have been stymied over the last decade as both the mosquito and the
parasite have evolved mechanisms to escape the limited, affordable
technologies available in the developing world. Drugs targeting the
parasite are losing their effectiveness. Today, resistance to choloroquine,
the cheapest and most widely used antimalarial, is common throughout
Africa. The next most effective but more expensive drug,
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), is also succumbing to resistance in highly
endemic areas of eastern and southern Africa.
The mosquito has proven just as wily a foe. _Anopheles gambiae_ is an
extremely efficient transmitter of the disease. Public health experts have
long called the mosquito the "most important insect in the world". _A.
gambiae_ has earned the epithet "malaria machine" because of its strong
preference for humans, and humans within its range can be bitten hundreds
of times a day. Elimination strategies, which have been successful in
industrialized countries, have stalled in the developing world, as cheap
insecticides are losing their potency to resistance and environmental
concerns have reduced their availability.
To open new research paths, TDR and its partners, including its co-sponsor
the World Health Organization, have pushed for over a decade to bring
genetics into the struggle against malaria. Seeds of this "molecular
entomology" were first planted in 1991 when scientists called to a TDR and
MacArthur Foundation meeting first proposed the then-unorthodox approach of
attacking malaria through genetics. In 2001, another TDR meeting, arranged
in collaboration with Institut Pasteur, launched the _A. gambiae_ genome
initiative. Now that work is done. The breakthroughs announced this week in
Nature <http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/mosquito/index.shtml> and
Science <http://www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/mosquito/index.shtml> open
an entirely new field to public health researchers.
With this new knowledge, malaria scientists will be able to pry out
information long hidden in the genomes which can be used to design new
insecticides, new repellants, and new drugs. "We now have the master plans
for man, plasmodium, and mosquito," says Morel. "This has opened a
completely new field of work for everyone. Now, anyone with a computer and
access to the internet will be able to look for targets for new drugs and
new insecticides."
The genetic codes themselves would be useless if there were not trained
researchers poised to exploit the information. Anticipating this day, TDR
has for the last 2 years been training over 100 scientists from Latin
America, Africa, and Asia in how to search the genomes, identify
vulnerabilities, and build new genetically-based drugs and insecticides.
Despite exuberance at these announcements, it is obvious from the pace of
developments following the decoding of the human genetic code that the
fruit of genomics takes a long time to mature. Still, for scientists who
have been stymied by the disease for years, the elucidation of the genomes
has electrified the field. "There is now information for everyone to work
24 hours a day to find solutions which can save millions of lives," says
TDR director Carlos Morel.

[The sequencing of _Plasmodium falciparum_ and _Anopheles gambiae_ is an
important milestone. The results provide important tools for drug
development, including providing further possibilities of developing drugs
or vaccines that can block the development of the parasite in the mosquito.
