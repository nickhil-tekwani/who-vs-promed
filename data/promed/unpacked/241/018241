The number of confirmed cryptosporidiosis cases jumped from 4 to 15 with
test results Delaware Health Department officials received over the
weekend. The health department has now provided crypto test kits to 138
people, up from 97 on Friday. Assistant Health Commissioner Nancy Shapiro
said Monday morning that more than 200 people have called the health
department about having diarrhea and other crypto symptoms.
Shapiro also said some crypto victims have had symptoms since mid-June and
visited physicians and emergency rooms for treatment. The health department
became aware of the outbreak July 27 and started issuing test kits and
health advisories then.
The 11 newly confirmed crypto victims range in age from 2 to 34, Shapiro
said. She said one little girl who has had crypto symptoms since mid-June
probably reinfected herself two or three times. She also said a couple of
victims have weakened immune systems, making them particularly vulnerable.
Crypto is caused by a protozoan parasite spread through human feces. Most
of the confirmed and suspected crypto victims were in contact with the
Olentangy Swim Association pool in Powell's Village Park. Operators of that
pool voluntarily shut it down for a week so the water could be tested and
treated with enhanced chlorine levels. It reopened Friday. Shapiro said
victims must get three consecutive negative test results before they are
considered free of the disease. She said some persons have felt better but
then experienced relapses. The health officials urge the following
precautions for those who have the disease or are in contact with victims:
Wash hands frequently, particularly after using the bathroom.
Avoid handling or preparing food. Infected food-service workers should not
work.
Sanitize diaper changing stations and other surfaces touched by small
children.
Do not swim for at least two weeks after symptoms abate.

Up to 137 individuals probably were sickened as a result of the
contamination of a swimming pool. State health officials confirmed that
samples from 11/17 ill individuals tested were positive for
_Cryptosporidium_. Age distribution [is 2-34 years. A filter test (55
gallons) following hyperchlorination was negative. Samples taken the day
the pool closed have not been tested yet.
Other measures taken: (from various reports). Day-care facilities in the
area (including adjoining Columbus and Franklin County) have been alerted
to take appropriate measures.

[Cryptosporidiosis is often a chronic infection and with no treatment some
people may be sick for days and weeks. It seems that the authorities have
been able to pinpoint the source of infection to a pool, but other
outbreaks have been waterborne, and the possibility still exists that the
primary source was drinking water back in June with the swimming pool being
contaminated afterwards. - Mod.EP
