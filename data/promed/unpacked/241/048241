A yellow fever [YF] outbreak in Sudan's Darfur region has killed 67 people so far, the United Nations health agency said today [7 Nov 2012], adding that the number of cases has more than doubled since the start of the epidemic last month [October 2012].

In a report, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the outbreak has now affected 17 localities in central, south, west, and north Darfur, with 194 cases reported -- a significant increase from the 84 initial cases reported at the start of the outbreak.

An estimated 200 000 cases of yellow fever, which is caused by a virus spread by mosquitoes, are recorded worldwide each year, with as many as 30 000 deaths reported, according to WHO. Patients experience jaundice, as well as other symptoms, such as fever and vomiting. There is no specific treatment for the disease and vaccination is the single most important measure for prevention.

In addition to monitoring the disease throughout Darfur, WHO said it is training more than 225 health workers in the region on disease surveillance, case management and infection prevention and control.

The health agency is also working with the Sudanese Ministry of Health to dispatch technical teams to help tame the outbreak by conducting investigations on new cases, meeting with local community leaders to raise awareness of the disease, and provide blood bank supplies as well as protective equipment to affected areas.

The report's recommendations also include strengthening disease surveillance in eastern Darfur, continuing laboratory testing of patients from newly affected localities, and finalizing a vaccination plan that identifies resources available as well as partners to implement it.

[The YF deaths have increased from 63 on 5 Nov 2012 to 67, 2 days later as reported above. The State Health Ministry of South Darfur indicated the urgent need for approximately 9 million doses of YF vaccine for the people in the affected area of Darfur. The report above indicates that the Ministry of Health is finalizing the YF vaccination plan, but does not indicate if the 9 million doses are on hand or have been ordered. Meanwhile, the outbreak is likely to continue unabated unless vector mosquito control can be quickly implemented while initiation of the vaccination campaign is awaited.

As Mod.JW pointed out in the previous ProMED-mail report of this outbreak (archive no. 20121106.1395260), individual immunity will be achieved 10 days after application of the vaccine, so speed in obtaining the vaccine and initiating the vaccination campaign is critical. The remoteness of some of the affected areas, coupled with insecurity of the general region will complicate control efforts.
