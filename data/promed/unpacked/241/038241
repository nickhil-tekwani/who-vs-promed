[Nagorno-Karabagh is a de facto independent republic, officially part of
the Republic of Azerbaijan. Its population is predominantly Christian, pigs
being a significant part of agriculture. This, similarly to its neighbour
Armenia, but in difference with predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan and Iran.

No clinical, epidemiological or PM observations of the affected animals are
