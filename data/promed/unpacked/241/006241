An aggressive tick that can transmit a disease causing fever and fatigue has an increased presence in Wisconsin, bug experts say. A person in north western Wisconsin has contracted a type of ehrlichiosis that is relatively new to the state, according to University of Wisconsin-Madison [UW-Madison] health officials. The illness is carried by lone star ticks, and although there's no formal effort to track the ticks in Wisconsin, about a dozen have been found in the state, said UW-Madison entomology professor Susan Paskewitz.

"It says to me there actually must be thousands and thousands of them out there," Paskewitz said. "I'm really suspicious now that we may have established populations that are capable of making it through some of our winters."

The ticks are abundant in Texas, the "Lone Star State", and other southern states, Paskewitz said. The female tick has a white spot on her back.

The Barron County resident sickened in May 2013 was Wisconsin's 3rd confirmed case of the type of ehrlichiosis associated with lone star ticks, according to the Department of Health Services. Other cases were reported in Chippewa County in 2008, and in Eau Claire County in 2011, the Wisconsin State Journal (http://bit.ly/17zknGT) reported.

Ehrlichiosis can cause fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, confusion and a rash, among other symptoms, and it can be treated with antimicrobial agents, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In about 2 per cent of cases, the disease is fatal. Symptoms generally appear 1 to 2 weeks after a tick bite.

[Although not specifically stated, the organism referred to is likely to be _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_, the cause of human monocytic ehrlichiosis. The organism is named after Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, the location of the 1st patient from whom the organism was isolated.

This is a moderation on ehrlichiosis by my colleague Mod.ML posted earlier this year (Ehrlichiosis - USA: (GA) blood transfusion, ex FL 20130405.1624168):

"Ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne zoonotic disease that is caused by rickettsia-like obligate intracellular bacteria.

"The following is mostly extracted from a CDC publication available at http://www.cdc.gov/ehrlichiosis/:

"Human ehrlichiosis is a disease caused by at least 3 different ehrlichial species in the United States: _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_, _Ehrlichia ewingii_, and a 3rd _Ehrlichia_ species provisionally called Ehrlichia muris-like (EML). _Ehrlichia_ are transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick. The lone star tick (_Amblyomma americanum_) is the primary vector of both _E. chaffeensis_ and _E. ewingii_ in the United States.

"Most cases of ehrlichiosis have been reported from the southern and south-central United States, corresponding to the geographic distribution of the lone star tick, _Amblyomma americanum_. The lone star tick is found throughout the eastern, southeastern and south-central states. The distribution, range and abundance of the lone star tick have increased over the past 20-30 years, and lone star ticks have been recorded in large numbers as far north as Maine and as far west as central Texas and Oklahoma (http://www.cdc.gov/stari/disease/).

"The tick bite is usually painless, and about half of the people who develop ehrlichiosis may not even remember being bitten by a tick. Typical symptoms include: fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. Rash occurs in up to 60 percent of children but less than 30 percent of adults. Usually, these symptoms occur within 1-2 weeks following a tick bite.

"Ehrlichiosis is diagnosed based on symptoms, clinical presentation, and later confirmed with specialized laboratory tests. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in whole blood is most sensitive in the 1st week of illness, and quickly decreases in sensitivity following the administration of appropriate antibiotics. During the 1st week of illness, a microscopic examination of blood smears may reveal morulae (microcolonies of ehrlichiae) in the cytoplasm of white blood cells in up to 20 percent of patients. Culture isolation of _Ehrlichia_ is only available at specialized laboratories.

"Antibodies to the _Ehrlichia_ are usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset. The gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of ehrlichiosis is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using _E. chaffeensis_ antigen, performed on paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant (4-fold) rise in antibody titers. The 1st sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the 1st week of symptoms, and the 2nd sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive.

"The severity of ehrlichiosis may depend in part on the immune status of the patient. Persons with compromised immunity caused by immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., corticosteroids, cancer chemotherapy, or long-term immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplant), HIV infection, or splenectomy appear to develop more severe disease and may also have higher case-fatality rates.

"The 1st line treatment for adults and children of all ages is doxycycline. Ehrlichiosis is a serious illness that can be fatal if not treated correctly, even in previously healthy people. Severe clinical presentations may include difficulty breathing, or bleeding disorders. The estimated case fatality rate (i.e., the proportion of persons who die as a result of their infection) is 1.8 percent. Patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication, while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics, prolonged hospitalization, or intensive care.

"_E. chaffeensis_ has been shown to survive for more than a week in refrigerated blood. Several instances of suspected _E. chaffeensis_ transmission through solid organ transplant have been investigated, although, to date, no cases [before this one] have been confirmed that can be attributed to this route of transmission.
