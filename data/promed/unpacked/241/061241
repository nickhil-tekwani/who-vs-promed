In the past one month, 7 more people have died of Rift Valley fever, bringing the toll to 26, a report from the Ministry of Health's Disease Surveillance and Response Unit says.

A total of 6 people died in Wajir, while one person succumbed in Marsabit. Some 24 cases were reported in Wajir and 2 in Marsabit.

Siaya County on Friday [22 Jun 2018] issued an alert after one person died from the mosquito-borne disease, which was confirmed by tests at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri).

"Tests for Ebola and Marburg virus were negative," Dr Omondi Owino, Siaya's chief officer for Health, said.

The Health Ministry report says males were the most affected, at 70 percent. The most affected age group is 21-30 years.

Based on enhanced surveillance of Rift Valley fever-like syndromes in humans and livestock, 6 counties have been identified as having the highest risk of an outbreak, including Tharaka-Nithi, Garissa, Tana River, Lamu, Garissa, Kajiado and Baringo.

Mombasa and Nairobi are on heightened alert due to the risk of imported human and animal cases.

The outbreak was 1st reported in Eldas Sub-County, Wajir, with a sample sent to Kemri testing positive for the virus on 7 Jun [2018].

The report said the outbreak was prevalent in insecurity-prone regions, and this might make it difficult to contain the virus. "The communities are hard to reach (due to their nomadic lifestyle) and they depend majorly on animal products and have difficulties in accessing alternative diets," the report said.

The ministry has formed a team of experts from government and non-governmental organisations to provide technical guidance to counties.

"Counties affected have been directed to send blood specimens to Kemri for confirmation while the ban on movement and slaughter of animals from the affected and at-risk counties is put in place," Dr Okunga said.

The ministry has provided 500 000 doses of RVF vaccine [for animals] to high-risk counties based on risk analysis, while indoor residual spraying and animal spraying with pyrethroids is being carried out at the epicentre.

However, vector surveillance and control for humans and animals in high-risk counties are yet to start. "This will start soon. We are going to ensure that the surveillance starts as soon as possible and investigation teams sent out to all high-risk counties to provide technical guidance before the outbreak," he said.

Rift Valley fever is a disease that mainly affects livestock while people are mainly infected as a result of handling sick animals, either slaughtering them or assisting animals while giving birth. The other mode of transmission from animals, which is relatively low, is by mosquitoes and bites from other insects. The disease causes abortion in animals.

Dr Okunga cautioned residents not to directly handle sick animals or slaughter them without consulting veterinary or public health officers.

Residents have also been encouraged to use mosquito [bed] nets.

"Anyone with a sick animal -- mainly sheep and cows -- must report to the nearest authorities immediately, and cases of abortions or loss of pregnancy in these animals must be reported too," he said.

[The RVF outbreak continues in both humans and animals. Contacting and informing the nomadic population across the broad area of the outbreak will be a challenge, as will administration of the vaccine to their animals. Mosquito vector surveillance should provide some real-time indications of the occurrence of the virus in the affected and nearby areas. Vector control, however, will be difficult. - Mod.TY

Following confirmation of a Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak in sheep on a farm in Jacobsdal area, Free State in May 2018 (NICD web alert, 22 May 2018), human and vector surveillance was conducted on the affected farm by the Provincial Department of Health and NICD. Mosquitoes collected on the affected farm tested negative for RVF virus, suggesting that active transmission had diminished due to decreased mosquito populations.

Farmworkers and residents, who had been involved in the handling of potentially contaminated animal tissues during the sheep outbreak, were interviewed and sampled for RVF testing at NICD. Of 10 persons sampled, 4 individuals were retrospectively confirmed to have been infected with RVF virus; 4 individuals were shown to have probably been infected with RVFV, pending further tests on follow-up blood samples for confirmation; 2 individuals were not infected with RVFV despite handling potentially contaminated tissues. Of these, 6 of the 8 cases reported having experienced mild symptoms (fever, muscle pain, headache) in the preceding month, while none developed a severe disease that necessitated hospitalization. Healthcare workers must be aware of RVF and be vigilant for patients who meet the case definition, and, in such instances, submit specimens to the NICD-NHLS for laboratory testing (Healthcare worker guidelines and Case Investigation Form).

[It is not surprising that there is evidence of RVF virus infection in farm workers, fortunately without severe disease, in the areas where the sheep were infected. In the 21 Jun 2018 report (see ProMED-mail archive no. Rift Valley fever - South Africa (02): animal, preventive vaccination 20180622.5870338), Peter Oberem, Afrivet farm CEO, is quoted as stating that 250 sheep died in May [2018] of Rift Valley fever on a farm in Jacobsdal in the Free State [also see ProMED-mail archive no. 20180517.5799859]. He continued: "...reported cases so late in the season -- it is already winter in the southern hemisphere -- is worrying. It's not because we can expect a full-blown epidemic right away, but cases now point to a very good chance of a serious outbreak in summer [2018]. The biggest mistake farmers can make is to be complacent in winter," says Oberem. - Mod.TY, citing the post of infected sheep by Mod.AS.
