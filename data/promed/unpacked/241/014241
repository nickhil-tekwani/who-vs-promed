"There has been renewed interest in the possibility of an association
between coronary heart disease and infection, specifically with _Chlamydia
pneumoniae_. This organism is now recognised as a common cause of
respiratory tract infection. Several investigators have documented as
association between coronary heart disease and the presence of high titres
of antibodies to _C. pneumoniae_. The organism has also been detected in
atherosclerotic plaques. Furthermore, it has been found that _C.
pneumoniae_ might be involved both in atherogenesis and in plaque
instability. We decided to test the hypothesis that treatment of patients
with unstable angina with an antibiotic with antichlamydial activity,
Roxithromycin, in addition to conventional therapy, would reduce subsequent
plaque instability and associated clinical events.
METHODS
Patients with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. Patients
were randomly assigned either Roxithromycin 150 mg orally twice a day
(n=102) or placebo orally twice a day (n=100). The treatment was for 30
days.
These findings show that roxithromycin therapy is associated wih a
significant reduction in the composite triple endpoint rates (p=0.018). In
addition, roxithromycin therapy resulted in non-significant reductions in
the rates of recurrent angina, myocardial infarction, and ischaemic death
from 5.4 %, 2.2 % and 2.2 % in the placebo group to 1.1 %, 0% and 0 % in
the roxithromycin group,respectively.
The results presented here support the hypothesis of a new mechanism for
plaque instability because patients treated with roxithromycin for a period
of 30 days showed a significant reduction in the occurrence of major
ischaemic events compared with the placebo group. Other pathogens such as
_Helicobacter pylori_ and cytomegalovirus have been associated with
coronary artery diseae, and are being investigated. In the present study,
treatment was randomly allocated independent of baseline _C. pneumoniae_
lgG titres and no differences were observed in baseline characteristics of
patients. Therefore the results observed may be seen as a consequence of
the modification of an intrinsic factor that influences the predisposition
of plaque rupture.
There are at least two possible explanations for the findings of the
present study. First, roxithromycin, through its antichlamydial activity,
may suppress the reactivation of chronic infection within the
atherosclerotic plaque. Secondly roxithromycin also has antiinflammatory
activity, this action may attenuate the persistent inflammation in the
plaque leading to a more stable state."
