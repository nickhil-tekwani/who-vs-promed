Last week 8 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or
"mouse fever" were reported in the Republic of Mariy El. Half of the
patients are residents of Ioshkar Ola. According to sources in
Rospotrebnadzor [Territorial Directorate of the Federal Service for
Surveillance in the Field of Consumer Rights' Protection and Human
Well-being] HFRS is contracted most often by gardeners.
The MariMedia Group (an international information service) commented
that an increase of HFRS at this time of year reflects also increased
migration of mice at the end of autumn to habitats closer to human
population. In addition, the number of people in the Republic of
Mariy El who contract HFRS disease each year is increasing, because
[rodent control has been neglected].

[In 2005, 168 people contracted HFRS in the Republic of Mariy El;
morbidity there exceeded the all-Russian morbidity rate almost 5-fold
and was 23.3 per 100 000 inhabitants. According to data for the
period up to 11 Oct 2006 (<http://www.regnum.ru/news/720354.html>) 92
cases of HFRS have already been registered in the Republic this year,
2006. An increase in HFRS morbidity frequently occurs in the autumn
when rodents move closer to [human] habitations. The level of HFRS
morbidity this year [2006] will reach last year's if cases continue
to occur at the rate observed in the past week. Insufficient rodent
control and an increase in the number of waste-dumps in woodland and
parks are encouraging an increase in rodents -- the reservoirs of HFRS virus.
The Republic of Mariy El is in the middle of the Volga Valley, and
occupies a territory of 23 200 sq. km., which is 0.13 percent of the
total area of the Russian Federation. It has a population of 766 200,
62 percent of whom are urban residents. It is located approximately
400 miles southeast of Moscow. - Mod.NP]

In April 2005, the regional Centres of State Sanitary and
Epidemiological Surveillance and Control (Gossanepidnadzora) were
split into 2 organizations -- the new regional centres for
surveillance -- Rospotrebnadzor, and the new Federal State Health
Institutions Centres of hygiene and epidemiology. Funding for both
organisations continues to come from the federal budget. The 2
organizations collaborate closely on outbreak investigations,
vaccination and infectious disease control. - Mod.CP]
[There appears to be an increase of cases of HFRS in Russia this year
over previous years. However, since the disease is endemic rather
than emerging, this thread is now cut. - Mod.JW]
