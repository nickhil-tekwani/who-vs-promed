[1] Cholera - Iraq (Najaf)
Date: Wed 13 Jun 2007

Iraq has reported 5 cases of cholera among children in the last 3
weeks, a worrying sign as summer sets in and the war leaves sewage
and sanitation systems a shambles. All of the cases were among
children younger than 12 in the southern city of Najaf and were
reported by medical officials on alert for signs of the potentially
lethal ailment, Claire Hajaj of the United Nations Children's Fund,
or UNICEF, said Tue 12 Jun 2007.
Although the number of cases so far is low, and none has been fatal,
the emergence of cholera this early in the year is ominous, Hajaj
said. Cholera outbreaks usually don't arise until July [2007], when
temperatures can soar above 120 deg F.
As the temperature rises, Iraq's chronic electricity shortages make
it difficult to operate pumps at sewage and drinking-water treatment
plants, creating a dangerous mix of desperate people and dirty water.
Already, the number of diarrhea cases, which can be a sign of
cholera, is twice the seasonal average, Hajaj said.
In the capital, Baghdad, alone, at least 135 000 residents depend on
water from tanker trucks. Tens of thousands of Iraqis bore holes into
the ground outside their houses and businesses and pump their own
ground water. The UN estimates that only 17 percent of Iraqi sewage
is being treated because of nonworking sewage treatment plants. Like
water treatment plants, they operate on electricity. Most sewage
pours into the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.

[2] Cholera, diarrhea - India (Karnataka)

With the monsoon playing truant and Bangalore's weather at its
unpredictable best, there has been a rise in cases of water-borne
diseases. Hospitals in the city are reporting an increased incidence
of gastroenteritis (GE) and the appearance of cholera.
According to Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) health
officials, 210 cases of GE were reported from the city limits till
the end of May 2007. "We have not seen any cholera cases in 2007.
Even if hospitals have reported stray cases, they may not have been
confirmed through bacteriology tests," said L.T. Gayathri, BBMP chief
health officer.
However, Victoria Hospital authorities have a different story to
tell. They have confirmed 5 cases of cholera that have been referred
to the Epidemic Diseases (Isolation) Hospital. There have, however,
been no cholera fatalities.
In M.S. Ramaiah Hospital, 10 cases of cholera were reported while in
the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health, 1 or 2 children with GE
are being treated every day. These cases were of a mild nature and
most often were treated as out-patients, M.L. Siddaraju, director of
the institute, said.

[3] Cholera - Somalia (Somaliland)
Date: Wed 6 Jun 2007

More than 600 cases of cholera, including 8 cholera-related deaths,
have been reported in the Togdheer region of Somaliland in the past 2
weeks. Save the Children UK is working quickly with the Ministry of
Health and other agencies to help contain the outbreak aiming to keep
death rates under 1 percent.
Save the Children UK's emergency health adviser, Elizabeth Berryman,
said: "Cholera is spreading fast leaving up to 70 000 people at risk.
Cholera spreads very quickly and can cause rapid, severe dehydration
which is very difficult to control. Children are particularly
vulnerable to dehydration and severe cases of cholera are difficult
to treat in children. Early treatment, surveillance and prevention
are crucial.
"If health systems in Africa were properly resourced with doctors,
nurses and a network of community health workers, and the correct
drugs stocked, cholera outbreaks would not escalate as fast as they
have done here. Access to health care has to be improved and fast if
we're to stop hundreds dying for diseases and infections that are
easy to cure."
Somaliland has been devastated in recent years by drought, floods and
local conflict. It has poor health infrastructure and sanitation and
is often neglected by international agencies and donors. Save the
Children has been running health programmes in Togdheer region for
the last 7 years.

Somaliland (from
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somaliland>) is a de facto independent
republic located in the Horn of Africa within the internationally
recognized borders of Somalia. On 18 May 1991, the people of
Somaliland declared independence from Somalia. However, it was not
recognized by any other country or international organization. It is
bordered by Ethiopia in the south and west, Djibouti in the
northwest, the Gulf of Aden in the north, and the autonomous region
Puntland in Somalia in the east. The capital of Somaliland is
Hargeisa. - Mod. LL]
