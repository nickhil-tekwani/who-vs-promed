Pertussis is continuing to spread across California, public health officials said Friday [30 May 2014], with the number of whooping cough cases in Sacramento County so far in 2014 nearly doubling what the county confirmed for the entire year in 2013. Among 3 other counties in the capital region, only Yolo County is seeing a similarly dramatic increase, though the number of cases confirmed there is far lower.

Statewide, the California Department of Public Health has counted 2649 pertussis -- or whooping cough -- cases from the start of 2014 through Tue 27 May 2014. In April alone, more than 800 people from Eureka to Escondido contracted the disease, said Dr Ron Chapman, the state's health officer. Infants are especially vulnerable to whooping cough, Chapman said, noting that before year's end, "the number of pertussis cases is likely to continue to increase."

Everyone, particularly those who are around babies -- such as parents, care providers, and healthcare workers -- should get the pertussis immunization. It's especially important for women who are pregnant to receive a pertussis vaccine booster during their 3rd trimester so the shot's immune properties are transferred to their babies. Newborns are not old enough to receive whooping cough immunizations until 2 months of age, after which boosters are given at 4 months and 6 months.

Health officials in Sacramento County confirmed 137 cases so far, compared with 70 cases total in all of last year [2013]. In 2010, the worst year in recent memory, the county saw 175 cases. In Yolo County, 14 cases have been counted in 2014, up from 4 in 2013. El Dorado County has reported only 2 cases so far this year, compared with last year's total of 4. And Placer County has confirmed 37 cases, less than half of the 85 cases reported in 2013.

So far in 2014, 2 infants have died of pertussis in California, 1 in Placer County and the other in Riverside County. One of the babies contracted the disease last year.

[It certainly appears that the current DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine) vaccination protocol (1) results in waning pertussis immunity, which creates a reservoir for _Bordetella pertussis_ that can infect infants less than one year of age, and particularly less than 6 months old, that are particularly at risk for morbidity and mortality. Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting the susceptible cohort.

A recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.

During the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.

In Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.

An additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of the health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and reported that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurs associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine, but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.
