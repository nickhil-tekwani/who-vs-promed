A total of 5 plague cases have been found in animals in south Santa Fe since November [2014], according to the [New Mexico] state Department of Health.

3 cats, 1 dog and 1 mouse were confirmed with the bacterial disease, all associated with residences along the Interstate 25 corridor between Cerrillos Road and Old Las Vegas Highway.

The disease is carried by fleas often found on rodents, but the fleas can transmit plague when they hop to a person or pet and bite it looking for a blood meal.

You also can catch plague through direct contact with diseased animals.

"We are seeing die-offs of rabbits, squirrels, pack rats and various rodents in several areas of New Mexico from both plague and tularemia," said Dr. Paul Ettestad, public health veterinarian, in a news release.

People are advised to prevent their pets from roaming, consider appropriate flea control, clean up areas such as wood and brush piles that attract rodents, have any sick pets promptly examined by a veterinarian, and see their own doctor about any suspicious illness.

Symptoms of plague in humans include sudden and severe fever, chills, headache and weakness, as well as painful lymph node swelling in the groin, armpit or neck.

In animals, plague can be signaled through fever, lethargy and loss of appetite, along with swelling under the jaw.

In 2014, 17 cases of plague were reported in dogs and cats in New Mexico and 2 cases were reported in humans, both of whom recovered. The previous year saw 4 human plague cases in New Mexico, with 1 person dying.

Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western USA. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Plague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague (1). Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.

Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially with cats, serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.

Veterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.

Another form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.

You should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home on a pet can also transmit disease to you, the owner or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas (2). Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.
