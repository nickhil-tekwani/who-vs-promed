The strain of avian influenza reported recently in ProMED-mail posting 20151130.3828711 was not HPAI but rather LPAI. This was determined through routine wild bird surveillance.

This virus poses no threat to human health. As with any avian influenza virus, the CFIA recommends adequate on-farm biosecurity measures to prevent introduction of the disease into domestic poultry. An ongoing surveillance program is in place in domestic poultry throughout Canada.
