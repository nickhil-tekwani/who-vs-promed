An outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), a viral infection transmitted
by mosquitos, was reported for the first time in New York City in early
September. Of the 11 serologically-confirmed cases, 3 have died. Another 80
cases are being investigated, of which approximately 10% are considered
probable cases of SLE, based on clinical criteria.
Of the 11 cases mentioned above, 9 were in older adults aged 58-87 years;
the other 2 were aged 38 and 15. The course of the illness in these younger
patients has been less severe.
As the laboratory-confirmed cases were in residents of Queens (8), Brooklyn
(1) and South Bronx (2), local authorities have undertaken vigorous
measures to control the mosquito population, by spraying the entire city
with malathion (by air) or resmethrine (on the ground). Active surveillance
for human cases and mosquitos continues.

[It is noteworthy that the Bronx is now mentioned as the residence of an
SLE case-patient. This is the third of the five NY City boroughs to have
at least one SLE case-patient. No mention is being made of SLE virus
infections that are not manifested as central nervous system illnesses.
There must be some, perhaps many. - Mod.CHC
