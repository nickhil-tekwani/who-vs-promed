A student at the University of New Brunswick [UNB] in Fredericton has "recently" been diagnosed with the measles, the university said in a statement [Mon 10 Apr 2017]. It is the 1st confirmed case of the highly contagious virus in the province since 2013 and is linked to a recent outbreak in Nova Scotia, according to health officials.

"The student in question was not a member of the residence community, is currently receiving treatment and is doing well," the university said in what it described as an "important public health notice."

Those known to have been in direct contact with the student have been notified, but as a precaution, university officials have released a list of dates, times, and locations where people may have come into contact with the affected student between 22 Mar and 30 Mar [2017].

We would ask that the UNB community refer to the information," and anyone who made contact should watch for measles symptoms until 20 Apr 2017, the statement said.

Early symptoms of the measles, which usually appear 8-12 days after infection, are similar to the common cold, including a cough, runny nose and sore eyes, followed by a fever and a red blotchy rash that spreads from the face down to the body.

"According to public health officials, the risk of contracting measles in this situation is low, but if you are experiencing symptoms ... we encourage you to contact public health," the notice said.

Most people are protected from the measles by being adequately vaccinated, Department of Health spokesperson Veronique Taylor said in an email.

Anyone born after 1970 who has not had the free 2-dose vaccine that protects against the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and has never had the measles is at risk.

Measles can be spread through the air via coughs or sneezes by an infected person, according to health officials.

It can also be spread by direct contact with infected secretions of the nose and throat through sharing food, drinks, cigarettes, or kissing someone who has the virus.

The virus can remain contagious on surfaces for up to 2 hours. A person can spread measles from 4 days before to 4 days after the rash develops.

Measles can cause ear infections and pneumonia. Swelling of the brain occurs in one child out of 1000 and can lead to seizures, deafness, mental retardation or death.

There is no specific treatment for the measles. Most people are sick for up to 10 days and then recover completely.

Anyone who has already had the measles is considered protected for life. Adults born before 1970 are considered immune.

The university said it is working with public health in its investigation and management of the case and will provide updates as they become available.

Over the past 5 years, Canada has seen an average of 10 cases of measles each year.

But Nova Scotia has had a recent outbreak, with at least 20 cases reported so far this year [2017], and Ontario has also recently reported some cases.

Almost all cases are linked to international travel or exposure to individuals who travelled abroad, said Taylor.

New Brunswick has had 2 reported cases of measles between 2002 and 2011, according to health officials.

Alberta Health Services [AHS] issued an alert on Tue [11 Apr 2017] due to a confirmed case of measles in Calgary.

"Unfortunately, we do not know how many people were exposed... and that's why we're asking people to self-identify," AHS spokesperson Shannon Evans said.

AHS will also be directly contacting additional people who were exposed.

"Other exposure settings were at the individual's place of work and a physician's office, but these other settings are not a risk to general public," Evans said.

Anyone exposed to measles is asked to monitor themselves for symptoms.

Symptoms of measles include: fever of 38.3 deg C [101 deg F] or higher; cough, runny nose, and/or red eyes; a red blotchy rash that appears 3 to 7 days after fever starts, beginning behind the ears and on the face and spreading down to the body and then to the arms and legs.

According to AHS records, this is the 1st case of measles in Calgary since 2014.

If you have young children who attend daycare, or even school-aged kids, you know that getting unexpected letters home can be scary. And, it usually means your child is going to get sick because a virus or some illness is going around.

So you could imagine one Staten Island mother's reaction when she received a letter from her son's daycare that a child had been diagnosed with measles.

"A child in our infant group has been diagnosed with the measles. Since this child has a sibling in one of the older groups, and all preschool groups have been together for special events, we are sending the notice home Center wide," the letter from the College of Staten Island Children's Center read.

The mother posted a photo of the letter to a popular Staten Island parent Facebook page, outraged that a sick child was allowed to attend school. The post has since been taken down.

She also wondered how the child contracted measles, since vaccinations are typically a requirement to attend school and many daycare centers in New York.

The post received dozens of comments from concerned parents.

"Upon report of a single child on [Fri 7 Apr 2017] whose pediatrician thought might have the measles, the Center followed DOH (Department of Health) protocols and sent a letter home to all parents. Although this case of the measles is not confirmed, the Center will require a doctor's note indicating that the child is medically cleared to return to the Center. This is the Center's policy with any contagious illness," said Ken Bach, spokesman for the College of Staten Island.

Prior to receiving the phone call, the child had not been at the Center since [Mon 3 Apr 2017] after the child developed a low-grade fever and was picked up shortly thereafter, Bach told the Advance.

Bach said that the Center follows all Department of Health and Mental Hygiene [DOHMH] requirements "to ensure the health of all children who stay in the Center."

"All children with the Center are required to be up to date with their immunizations. The Center permits both of the DOH exemptions, a religious exemption or a medical exemption. Should a child with an exemption for a specific disease be registered with the Center when a case of that disease is reported, that child will not be able to participate in the program for a minimum of 2 weeks," Bach said in a statement to the Advance.

The post created an uproar and re-ignited the ongoing vaccination debate.

In another post on the Facebook page, a parent stated her anger that some parents bring their sick children to school or do not pick them up when they are sick, letting them sit in the nurse's office or in class until the end of the day.

"Sometimes kids are contagious before they are outwardly sick...," stated one parent, arguing that, like the measles, children can be contagious for days before they show any symptoms.

Another parent said that there is no excuse for sending a sick child to school: "If your child is sick you should keep him or her home. It's unfair that because you may have work that my child gets your kid's germs. We should be considerate of people's lives but what about being considerate about getting other children sick?"

Other parents were more understanding. "Kids get germs from everywhere. Not everyone is lucky enough to be able to choose between work and staying home. I always had someone do it so it was easier for us but I do feel bad for people who have no choice," another woman posted on the comment thread.

Then, the vaccination debate began.

While it is a requirement for children who want to attend school and daycare centers in New York, there are a religious and medical exemptions to the vaccination mandate.

Additionally, children under the age of 1 are not required to receive the vaccination to attend.

In a shared space daycare that is occupied by infants who have not received the vaccination, who may have been exposed to the illness, and older children who have received the vaccination, contracting a disease is not difficult.

The DOHMH requires that pre-kindergarten students, including daycare, Head Start, and nursery school students receive at least 1 of the 2 doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in order to attend.

Kindergarten through 12th grade and college require both doses.

The vaccination schedule states that children get 2 doses of the MMR vaccination; the 1st dose is given between 12-15 months old and the 2nd dose is given between 4-6 years old, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) website.

As with any vaccination, the MMR poses some risk and side effects are possible.

The CDC says that fever occurs in 1 out of 6 cases; a mild rash occurs in 1 out of 20 and swollen glands in the cheek or neck in 1 out of 75 within 6-14 days of receiving the vaccine.

More uncommon reactions to the vaccine include seizure, in 1 out of 3000; temporary pain or stiffness in the joints, in 1 out of 4, and temporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder, in 1 out of 30 000 cases.

There are 14 laboratory-confirmed cases of measles in Bulgaria. The DNA analysis of Bulgaria's National Centre on Infectious and Parasitic Diseases showed on 31 Mar [2017], the virus is the same [as] the one reported in Romania.

Many measles cases have been reported in Italy, France, and Germany, where the infection is endemic. People who often travel to those countries should be monitored.

Health specialists advise bus and lorry drivers, who return from those countries to avoid close contact with many people in the period following their return in order to prevent dissemination of the diseases.

http://www.praguemonitor.com/2017/04/12/northern-moravia-has-unprecedented-38-cases-measles


A total of 38 cases of measles have been registered in the Moravian-Silesian [Moravskoslezský] Region, with the situation being the worst in Ostrava, regional sanitary officer Helena Sebakova has told CTK [Czech News Agency], adding that such incidence of the viral disease has been unprecedented in the past years.

One week ago there were 17 cases of the disease, she added.

Sebakova said 20 patients are children under 15 months who cannot be vaccinated because of their low age. The remaining 18 are adults, including 6 medical workers.

People who only got one vaccine [dose] in the past are also threatened with the disease, Sebakova said.

Daily Lidove noviny (LN) writes today that epidemiologists say if 95 percent of the population is vaccinated, the spread of the virus stops.

Vaccinologist Roman Prymula told LN that the Czech Republic has about the above share of vaccinated people.

"Since the resistance of certain groups of inhabitants to vaccination is growing, the disease my spread, however," he said.

Prymula said it is not clear where the virus came to the Ostrava vicinity from. In the past about 2 cases of the infection appeared in the Czech Republic annually. They were brought from abroad, he added.

The Infectious Diseases Hospital "Victor Babes" in Craiova [Dolj county) has been placed under quarantine after the number of patients hospitalized with measles and scarlet fever increased.

Visitor access to the hospital has been restricted.

Last week [week of 3 Apr 2017], a girl aged 1 1/2, who had been diagnosed with measles, died at this medical unit, according to sources in the hospital, cited by local News.ro.

The number of patients with measles is almost 50, according to the hospital medical director Constantin Ecobici. The quarantine measure was introduced last week, as an attempt to reduce the number of visitors at the hospital, he explained.

Alexandru Rafila, the personal advisor of the health minister, yesterday [11 Apr 2017] said that a 1 1/2-year-old child and a 17-year old woman died because of measles, and that the number of deaths caused by the measles epidemic in Romania has reached 21.

World Health Organization asks Romania and other countries to take action against measles outbreak (http://www.romania-insider.com/asks-romania-endemic-countries-take-action-measles-outbreak/).
