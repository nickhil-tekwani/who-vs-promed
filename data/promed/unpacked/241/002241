Discussion in Cayo and at particular meetings indicate a big concern for
the health of the reef as well. When there are 1000+ passengers per ship
flushing all their sewage into the sea over the course of a week, and
multiply that by several dozen ships each month, it would really have a
serious impact in the area. Does anyone know how the trash and sewage
disposal is handled? I've seen the beaches along the coast of Mexico,
and it's obvious that there is a major problem with trash washing
up...is it from the ships?

There are some quite famous video tapes been shown on television in
Miami, of the kitchen staff of cruise ships dumping garbage, waste,
plastics, oils and all kinds of stuff off the ship at night. They have
to do every day, even with compactors on board. They don't take their
waste back to port, they dump at sea. Some big cruise ships paid
multi-million dollar fines. But it takes a passenger on board with a
video camera, or night time surveillance from airplanes to catch them
dumping.

A few years ago I could not find scientific studies demonstrating the
transmission of disease to humans by swimming or bathing in the sea.
There was a very illustrative Article(Shuval, H.I. - The Case for
Microbial Standards for Bathing Beaches, in International Discharge of
Sewage from Sea Outfalls Symposium. Oxford: Pergamon Press, 1975 pp.
95-101) that estimated the amount of sea water accidentally swallowed
and that could be crossed with the concentration of pathogenic
microorganisms necessary for sickness. Of course that source of
contamination is reasonable, but it is very hard to isolate it from
eating sea food or getting upper respiratory tract infections during
summer vacations at the beach. Otherwise, This polemic issue must not
shadow the meaning of fighting for high quality water patterns.
