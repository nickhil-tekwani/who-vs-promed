At least 10 children have died from Measles and over 100 have been admitted in South Sudan's Payinjiar county, an area health official disclosed.

Stephen Gatliah Kuay, a county health supervisor, said on [Wed 25 Oct 2017] that 7 of the 10 children died before reaching the area health facility.

He described as "worrying" the situation in the area, stressing that lack of enough health kits makes it hard to treat children affected.

"I would like to request United Nations agencies like the UN Children Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization if they can support us through our health partners like IRC [International Rescue Committee] and UNIDO [United Nations International Development Organization]," Kuay told Sudan Tribune.

He said those below 5 years are at great risk of getting the disease, adding that the spread of Measles is fast in the community.

Measles, or rubeola, is a viral infection of the respiratory system. Measles is a very contagious disease that can spread through contact with infected mucus and saliva.

Measles is a leading cause of death in children. Of the 114 900 global deaths related to measles in 2014, the majority were under the age of 5, World Health Organization (WHO) said.

Somalia and the World Health Organization (WHO) have conducted a series of trainings to enhance national capacity in early outbreak detection and response for measles ahead of a nationwide measles vaccination campaign in November [2017].

WHO said the trainings aim to enhance measles surveillance and laboratory confirmation, improve measles case management during seasonal outbreaks and achieve the minimum routine measles vaccination coverage of 95 percent.

"Based on this national vision, public health professionals in Somalia are being updated on the measles case-based surveillance process," said Ghulam Popal, WHO Representative in Somalia, in a statement on [Thu 26 Oct 2017].

The Horn of Africa nation is currently facing its worst measles outbreak in 4 years, with almost 19 000 suspected cases reported as of [Tue 24 Oct 2017].

More than 80 percent of those affected by the outbreak are children under 10. Minimum routine measles vaccination coverage is only 60 percent.

In early 2017, WHO and partners, in collaboration with national health authorities, vaccinated almost 600 000 children aged 6 months -- 5 years for measles in hard-to-reach and hotspot areas across the country.

"Despite these efforts, the transmission of measles continues, compounded by the ongoing pre-famine situation, continued mass displacement, and undernourished children living in unhygienic conditions," WHO said.

The UN health agency said a nationwide campaign is planned for November to stop transmission of the disease, targeting 4.2 million children.

It said the campaign will also intensify efforts to strengthen routine immunization and reach unvaccinated children to boost their immunity.

A World Health Organisation, cluster consultant in Gombe State, Raymond Dankoli, has said the state recorded 15 deaths out of a total of 864 suspected cases of measles from January this year [2017] till date.

Mr. Dankoli disclosed this during a meeting with journalists on [Thu 2 Nov 2017] in Gombe. The meeting was organised by the Gombe State Primary Health Care Development Agency as part of a sensitisation campaign ahead of the 2017 Measles Campaign Vaccination scheduled for 30 Nov -- 15 Dec [2017].

He said that the state recorded the outbreak across 7 local government areas with Gombe Local Government Area having the highest number of cases pegged at 107.

"Unlike similar exercises held in 2015 which failed to record the desired outcome, the agency having learned from the past, is poised to conduct a successful exercise this time around with a view to attaining 95 percent coverage", he said.

Mr. Dankoli added that already, the agency has taken proactive steps in response to the disease outbreak by making available drugs for treating the disease, with trained staff carrying out surveillance activities.

The consultant said this year's [2017] vaccination exercise will target children from 9 -- 59 months, adding that every child is expected to receive treatment irrespective of the child's immunisation status.

Also speaking, the deputy director, immunisation, Gombe State Primary Health Care Development Agency, Musa Kuna, said that following the poor turnout during the last measles vaccination exercise in 2015, the agency "has pursued aggressively an advocacy and dialogue to find out why communities are refusing vaccination."

Mr. Kuna urged parents to retain vaccination cards to be issued during the exercise which would be used for the purpose of surveys.

The HSE has been notified of 2 confirmed cases of measles in north Dublin city.

An outbreak control team was convened to investigate and control the spread of the potentially serious illness. The source of measles wasn't immediately identified.

An alert has been sent to all hospital emergency departments and GPs in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. All people identified as contacts of the 2 measles cases are being notified and advised of the risk by public health officials.

"The best protection against measles is to be fully vaccinated with 2 doses of the MMR (Measles-Mumps-Rubella) vaccine," a HSE spokesperson said.

"If you have symptoms suggestive of measles you should stay at home, not go to school or work and phone your GP and explain that you may have measles."

People who have not been fully vaccinated with MMR vaccine or have not had measles in the past are at high risk of getting measles if exposed.

Those most at risk are those who are not fully vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine such as babies younger than 12 months who are too young to be vaccinated, and those with weakened immune systems.

Dr Deirdre Mulholland, Director of Public Health said: "Measles can be a serious illness and is highly contagious. The best protection is to be fully vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine."

Measles symptoms include a high fever, red eyes and a red rash that starts on head and spread down the body. This normally starts a few days after onset of illness. The rash consists of flat red or brown blotches, which can flow into each other. It lasts about 4 --7 days.

The time between exposure to measles and developing the rash is usually 14 days (range 7 -- 21 days). People are infectious from 4 days before rash starts until 4 days after.

Christmas events have been cancelled at a school hit by a measles outbreak, in a bid to control the spread of the disease which has seen up to 32 cases in the county.

The outbreak which began in September [2017] has seen 22 children contract measles at Wynstones Steiner Waldorf School in Brookethorpe.

Children of all ages have been affected at the school which takes children from age 3 -- 18, although half of the cases of measles have been among the children in the kindergarten aged 3 -- 6.

In their letter to parents, school managers wrote: "The school has been in regular contact with Public Health England (PHE) as we strive to support our families and pupils as best we can.

"We have decided to take the advice of PHE to protect the whole school community, as well as the local community, and will sadly be cancelling forthcoming large gatherings. We are tremendously disappointed ... - more.
