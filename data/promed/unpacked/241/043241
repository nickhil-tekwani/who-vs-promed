Officials at the Health Unit and Hogarth Riverview Manor located at 300 Lillie Street North have declared an outbreak of a respiratory illness on the Rose (6 North) and Tulip (6 South) Resident Home Areas.

All admissions, transfers, discharges and social activities have been canceled until further notice. Visitors are restricted to family members and caregivers only, so please call the facility for more information.

The Health Unit is urging people to refrain from visiting hospitals and long-term care facilities when feeling unwell to avoid spreading infections to those most vulnerable: young infants and children, the elderly and those with other chronic illnesses.

The Health Unit reminds the public that they can prevent getting and spreading infections by:
- Getting a seasonal flu shot from the Health Unit or local health care provider.
- Washing hands often for at least 15 seconds with soap and warm water or by using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
- Covering coughs/sneezes with the upper sleeve if no tissue is available.
- Putting all used tissues in the garbage right away.
- Staying at home if sick to avoid spreading infections to others.

[Another unit of the same long-term care facility at Thunder Bay mentioned in the above report declared a respiratory illness outbreak in early 2018 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/hogarth-riverview-outbreak-1.4537265. This led to cancellation of all admissions, transfers, discharges and social activities with restriction on incoming visitors.

The threat of emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic influenza, makes early detection of health events critical for effective control and intervention of such outbreaks. By using alternative, electronic data sources, there is a potential role for real-time syndromic surveillance systems (based on patient complaints at referral hospitals and tele reports) to detect outbreaks of respiratory disease before conventional diagnosis and laboratory-based surveillance identifies them https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2687041/.

Any updates on the underlying pathogen, epidemiological data on the affected population, and their clinical profile would be appreciated. The occurrence of a respiratory outbreak in the same facility within a 6-month period raises concerns about infection prevention and control measures in place as well. - Mod.UBA
