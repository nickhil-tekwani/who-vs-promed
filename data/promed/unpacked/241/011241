Fear of discovering brucellosis among their cattle is so strong that
if a cow aborts, some ranchers have been known to follow the
so-called Winchester Code of the West: shoot, shovel and shut up.
Once a cow or bull officially tests positive for the disease,
however, state and federal regulations kick in. Then the rancher is
left with 2 choices; one is bad, the other awful.
Early Monday, Jim and Sandy Morgan, who had 7 cows from their ranch
south of Bridger test positive for brucellosis in May 2007, picked
the bad choice.
Sandy Morgan and her mother, Connie Malcolm of Emigrant, stoically
worked the corrals, helping 5 Montana Department of Livestock brand
inspectors sort, herd and load the cows -- cattle from her
grandfather's genetic lines -- into double-decker cattle trucks to be
hauled to slaughter in South Dakota.
"It's devastating," Sandy Morgan said. "You're OK as long as you
pretend they're going to summer grass."
The awful choice would have been for the Morgans to refuse the USD
423 000 federal livestock officials offered for their nearly 600
cows, bulls and calves. Then the entire state of Montana would lose
its brucellosis-free status and producers would have to spend
millions to vaccinate and test cattle before shipping.
Brucellosis causes domestic cows to abort their calves. It is also
found in elk and bison. The feds have an unbendable rule: Once
brucellosis is found in a herd, that herd must be slaughtered.
Acting State Veterinarian Jeanne Rankin said she is breathing freer
for now. "It's a difficult decision, and nobody is happy," Rankin
said. "We need to protect the 2.4 million cattle in Montana and the
livelihood of these other ranchers."
Yet Montana remains under a brucellosis cloud. If one more cow tests
positive in the next 2 years, the state will lose its brucellosis-free
status.
Under the midday sun Monday [16 Jul 2007], the thermometer stuck at
103 F outside; 6 cattle trucks were lined up to ship the 284 cows and
16 bulls from Morgan's herd to Cimpl Packing in Yankton, South Dakota.
The 284 calves from the herd will be shipped today [17 Jul 2007]
from the ranch to Modesto, California, where they will be made into
veal. Rankin said the calves needed to go to another facility because
they weigh less and need different equipment at the packing plant than
adult cattle. Starting at 7 am Monday [16 Jul 2007], the calves were
weighed, and the numbered tag on each cow and bull was marked off on
the official federal list to make sure no animal was missing.
By 11 a.m., Sandy and Jim and the state officials were herding the
confused cows up the cattle chute into the trailer of the 1st truck.
The 1st 6 were cows that had tested positive for brucellosis, bearing
a big "B" brand on the left side of their necks. The 7th positive cow
was euthanized in Iowa in May 2007. The rest of the herd tested
negative, but they may have been exposed to the highly contagious
disease.
After crunching the numbers, the Morgans decided not to keep the
calves and fatten them for fall shipping. After the calves were
weighed Monday [16 Jul 2007], Jim and his wife's father, Bruce
Malcolm, watched an online video auction where similar weight calves
were selling for USD 1.45 a pound. The federal Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service, a division of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, offered the Morgans 85 cents a pound. "So
we're USD 56 000 short just on our calves," he said.
Dr. Ray Randall of Bridger Veterinary Clinic said the Morgan's calves
wouldn't have brought top price because they may have been exposed to
brucellosis. He said the Morgans may have a financial argument to
make, but the alternative of rejecting the buyout was unacceptable.
"If other ranchers had had to go through all the testing, they would
be mad at the state and mad at the feds and mad at the Morgans," he
said. "There'd be a lot of plain mad."
Jim Morgan called Dr. Lennis Knight, an APHIS vet in Helena, Monday
[16 Jul 2007] about the price difference on the calves, and he said
Knight promised to try to help. Knight did not return telephone calls
Monday [16 Jul 2007].
Rankin said it is the cattle industry's turn now. "We appreciate the
sacrifice of the Morgans and the Hergenriders, and we want the
industry to step up to the plate to restock their cattle, if
necessary," she said. Karen Hergenrider of Belfry grazed some cattle
with the Morgan herd and also was bought out by APHIS.
Since the Morgan herd was tested on 16 May 2007, the state has tested
more than 2700 head of cattle, mainly in the Bridger and Emigrant
areas. Herds that contacted the Morgan cattle will be retested this
fall.

Yellowstone National Park is located mostly in the state of Wyoming,
but also extends into Montana and Idaho.
Although Montana has done the epidemiology of tracing for this herd,
the possible loss of their coveted free state status remains at risk
for the next 2 years. So although there is an initial sigh of relief,
they will still be hoping not to find another case. - Mod.TG]
