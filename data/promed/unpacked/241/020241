Chinese rules stymie flu scientist
----------------------------------
A leading Hong Kong virologist researching the deadly H5N1 strain of avian
influenza told The Scientist this week that new regulations from China's
Ministry of Agriculture will prevent him investigating the virus.
"They are trying to stop me, trying to stop my investigation," said Guan
Yi, a University of Hong Kong researcher whose group published a paper in
Nature today (6 Jul 2005) describing the latest sequence data isolated from
dead geese near Qinghai Lake in western China.
Guan works at the University of Hong Kong's department of microbiology, and
also runs the Joint Influenza Research Center at Shantou University, in the
southern Chinese province of Guangdong.
It's that 2nd lab, a collaborative institute between Guangdong and Hong
Kong, that Guan is concerned about. He says its work will be stymied by new
rules concerning the collection, storage, and research of serum samples
from dead birds. The rules, first announced on 31 May 2005, but published
via the Internet on Tuesday [5 Jul 2005], imply that permission must be
granted for scientists to collect and research H5N1 samples, and that
isolates must be checked by the Ministry of Agriculture before further
research can be conducted.
On 16 Jun 2005, an urgent bulletin on the official Chinese Veterinary Drug
Information Net summarized the new rules. The notice also warned
researchers: "It has been discovered that a number of laboratories,
academic units, and institutes are carrying out research on deadly
pathogens without proper safety measures... To enforce the rules, the
[Ministry of Agriculture] will regulate and investigate research and
testing without permission, to stop unauthorized work."[see 20050616.1703].
"God help me," Guan said, sounding exasperated, "they are trying to close
everyone's lab." He said he believes the new rules are an excuse for
authorities to exert tighter control over the dissemination of lab results,
and are not aimed at protecting the wider population from bird flu
outbreaks that have dotted the country in recent months.
He said the regulations will mean that the Animal Influenza Laboratory of
Ministry of Agriculture in Harbin will become the primary lab sanctioned to
carry out diagnostics on avian flu.
"I have the safest BL3 lab in Asia.... Shipping the samples to Harbin after
I tell them it is an H5 virus is ridiculous," said Guan, adding that he
already shares all his findings and data with the Ministry of Agriculture
and the World Health Organization.
Guan said that only 2 labs in addition to Harbin have the permission needed
for continued research on H5N1: the South China Agricultural University,
and Yangzhou University Agricultural College.
In [the journal] Nature, Guan's group reports the results of sequencing H5
strains from the Qinghai Lake, a nature reserve in western China, where at
least 6000 migratory birds have died. Their findings point to a single
introduction of the virus, and show the likely source to be domestic
poultry from Guangdong Province.
Unauthorized Chinese language Web sites and blogs have circulated rumors
about bird flu illness in humans close to Qinghai Lake, but the reports
have been dismissed by China's central government. The World Health
Organization has also not received any confirmations of recent human cases
in China.
However, the new rules may also make it hard for farmers, scientists,
reporters, and officials to communicate suspected outbreaks. Rule number 4
of the new act states that no other entity except for the Veterinary Bureau
within the Ministry of Agriculture can disseminate information on animal
diseases. The final rule warns that "legal action will be taken against a
person who defies these laws."
The Chinese Ministry of Health, plus 6 other ministries including the
Ministry of Science and Technology Authority, Education Authority, and
Health Authority were signatories to the rules. But Guan said he believes
the main advocate for the rules is Jia Youling, a Ministry of Agriculture
spokesman and director general of the Veterinary Bureau. Jia could not be
reached for comment.

Nature's article on bird flu questioned
---------------------------------------
Jia Youling, director general of the Veterinary Bureau of the Chinese
Ministry of Agriculture, said here Friday [8 Jul 2005] an article on bird
flu carried in the renowned journal Nature [see 20050707.1922] made the
wrong conclusion.
The article, written by researchers of the Shantou University and the
University of Hong Kong, said the virus causing the bird flu outbreak in
northwest China's Qinghai Province may come from southern China, according
to their study on samples collected in Qinghai Lake.
None of the article's writers have been to Qinghai Lake to collect samples,
and the migratory birds in Qinghai Lake, which fly to China from the west,
will not pass the southern and eastern parts of China, so the article's
conclusion lacks credibility, said Jia.
No bird flu has broken out in southern China since [the beginning of] this
year, and the writers' laboratory lacks the basic conditions for biological
safety, he added.
The writers did not apply government approval for carrying out such bird
flu virus research, Jia said.

[Regarding the presence of H5N1 in southern China, subscribers are referred
to Wan XF et al (2005): Genetic characterization of H5N1 avian influenza
viruses isolated in southern China during the 2003-04 avian influenza
outbreaks. Arch Virol. 150(6):1257-66.
China has recently demonstrated the first -- though modest -- signs of
willingness to improve transparency in relation to animal (and human)
health. Hopefully, the current steps do not herald a return to the old
unfortunate tendency towards covertness. - Mod.AS]
