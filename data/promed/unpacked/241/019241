New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Margrethe Kog, Tonder, West [South Denmark]
Date of start of the outbreak: 7 Nov 2011
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Affected animals
Species: wild species
Susceptible: --
Cases: 1
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 0
Affected population: _E. multilocularis_ was detected in a fox (_Vulpes vulpes_) on 17 Apr 2012. The samples were collected from the fox on 7 Nov 2011.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments: On 17 Apr 2012, _E. multilocularis_ was detected in a fox (_Vulpes vulpes_) collected in connection with the Danish surveillance programme for _E. multilocularis_ in wildlife. The surveillance programme was initiated in the autumn 2011 and so far almost 300 foxes and more than 80 raccoon dogs (_Nyctereutes procyonoides_) have been examined. This surveillance programme is a targeted surveillance programme where the high-risk subpopulation is sampled.
_Echinococcus_ has previously been detected in 2000, where _E. multilocularis_ was detected in 3 out of 1040 foxes examined in a research project.
_E. multilocularis_ is therefore assumed to be present in Denmark, but at a very low prevalence.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Institute (national laboratory)
Species: wild species
Test: microscopic examination of larvae [foxes harbor the adult cestode, not larvae. - Mod.PMB]
Test date: 17 Apr 2012
Result: positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The metacestode (larval) form of _E. multilocularis_ causes alveolar hydatidosis in humans. The natural intermediate hosts are rodents and the definitive hosts (where adults are found) are wild canids like foxes. Domestic dogs and cats can become infected and act as a definitive host if they eat infected wild rodents. Alveolar echinococcosis has been reported in parts of central Europe, much of Russia, the Central Asian republics, and western China; the northwestern portion of Canada and western Alaska. A picture of an adult form of _E. multilocularis_ can be seen at http://www.antropozoonosi.it/Malattie/echinococcosi/Echinococcus_multilocularis_adult.jpg.
