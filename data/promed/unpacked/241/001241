Perm Region: Brucellosis detected in sheep
------------------------------------------
A focus of brucellosis among sheep has been detected in the
Chastinskiy district of the Perm region. The dangerous disease was
introduced by 25 infected sheep which were moved into the district in
June, 2004 from the Orenburg region.
The regional veterinary service has serologically identified 15
brucellosis-positive sheep.
The movement of the sheep was carried out without the permission of
the district state veterinary service, and the animals did not go
through the prescribed quarantine period. Consequently, the sheep
were resold, reaching 6 farms in 3 villages: Babka, Shabury and
Solomaty. All infected sheep and their contacts will be destroyed,
without further use of meat, skins or offal. Disinfection and
deratization [yes, it does mean getting rid of rats - PG] is planned for
the infected premises. People who had contact with the infected
animals will be put under medical follow-up and tested serologically.
Those engaged with animal vaccination will be protected by
vaccination, reports "New region".
According to physicians, the brucellosis bacteria, extremely
dangerous to humans, may be spread by aerosol. Earlier, the territory
of the Perm area was considered relatively safe in relation to
brucellosis infection in animals. In other regions of the country,
between 400 and 700 human patients are diagnosed annually. The
disease causes severe clinical signs, often becoming chronic,
resulting in physical disability.
Among the recommended preventive measures are thorough cooking of
meat and precautions when handling suspect animals and their products
[thermal treatment of milk and milk products is of prime importance,
not to be neglected. - Mod.AS]. Personnel involved with suspect
animals should be vaccinated.

[This information probably relates to _Brucella melitensis_, which is
endemic in several parts of the Russian Federation. Vaccination of
humans against brucellosis has been practiced in Russia (and
previously the Soviet Union) for several decades. The need to
vaccinate personnel engaged with vaccination of animals is the
outcome of their potential exposure to the live vaccines.
