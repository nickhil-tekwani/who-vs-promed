Wishaw Sports Centre closed its doors last week after the bug, which
can cause the potentially fatal Legionnaires' disease, was found.
Leisure bosses were left with no option but to shut down the busy
facility after the bacteria were detected in the plumbing system on
Wednesday evening [25 May 2011]. _Legionella_ was picked up on shower
heads and taps in the centre's dry side changing areas during routine
testing -- which happens once a month -- and on advice from the Health
and Safety Executive the building was immediately shut.

Fitness fans were forced elsewhere all day Thursday [26 May 2011] as
a "comprehensive cleaning process" of the centre's water system was
undertaken and the centre opened again on Friday [27 May 2011].
Legionnaires' disease is a potentially fatal form of pneumonia caused
by the bacterium _Legionella pneumophila_ and carries the same
symptoms as a normal flu.

When the Wishaw Press went to print yesterday (Tuesday 31 May 2011),
there had been no cases of Legionnaires' disease in the area. The
advice given by Wishaw Sports Centre to members calling last week was
to check with your local GP if you are feeling unwell.

A spokesman for North Lanarkshire Leisure said: "As part of our
routine testing and prevention programme, we discovered a small number
of elevated _Legionella_ readings in the dry side area of the sports
centre.

"We work closely with the Health and Safety Executive at all times
and as soon as we became aware of the situation, we agreed to
voluntarily close the centre yesterday evening (Wed 25 May 2011) for
further investigation and treatment of the areas concerned. Where
possible we notified our customers and apologised to them for any
inconvenience caused. Their health and safety and that of our staff is
our prime concern."

The Health and Safety Executive were staying tight-lipped when
quizzed last week, saying: "North Lanarkshire Leisure are cooperating
with the Health and Safety Executive in a health investigation."

A member of staff at Wishaw Sports Centre has been confirmed to have
Legionnaires' disease. The unnamed employee was hospitalised as news
of the discovery of _Legionella_ in the plumbing system at the popular
North Lanarkshire Leisure facility broke last week.

However, the employee's condition is thought to be in no way
connected to the _Legionella_ outbreak at Wishaw Sports Centre,
according to council sources. Instead, the member of staff is said to
have caught the more severe strain of the disease that has affected 9
people in the Glasgow outbreak of Legionnaires' that has occurred
during the last month.

A milder strain of the _Legionella_ bacteria that causes the
potentially deadly disease was discovered during routine tests in
showerheads and taps in the dry side changing rooms at Wishaw Sports
Centre a fortnight ago [25 May 2011]. A spokesman for North
Lanarkshire Leisure -- awaiting results of an investigation -- was
tightlipped when quizzed by the Wishaw Press this week, saying:
"Investigations are ongoing and on the advice of the Health and Safety
Executive the centre is open to the public."

Wishaw Sports Centre was closed immediately on the Wednesday evening
[25 May 2011] when the bacteria were detected. It remained shut all
day Thursday as its water system was put through a "comprehensive
cleaning process". The centre reopened on the Friday [27 May 2011]. As
yet there have been no reports of anyone being diagnosed with
Legionnaires' disease as a result of the _Legionella_ discovered
within the sports centre.

A spokesperson conceded that the staff member at Wishaw Sports Centre
did not contract the bug from work, and has fallen victim to the
recent Legionnaires' disease outbreak in Glasgow. In the last month,
the disease has affected 9 people living within the Greater Glasgow
and Clyde, and Lanarkshire health board areas. 3 people have died from
the disease.

Legionnaires' is a form of pneumonia and carries the same symptoms as
a normal flu. The advice is that if you experience any symptoms then
you should contact your GP.

[The isolation of _Legionella_ from the plumbing system at the Wishaw
Sports Centre in North Lanarkshire, Scotland was said to be the result
of routine monthly testing, and not the result of an outbreak
investigation; both news releases above state that there were no cases
of Legionnaires' disease as a result of the _Legionella_ discovered
within the sports centre. However, the 2nd news release fails to say
why the employee of the Wishaw Sports Centre is thought to have
acquired his illness as a result of the Glasgow outbreak of
Legionnaires' disease and not as a result of exposure at the sports
center.

According to a prior ProMED-mail post (Legionellosis, fatal - UK:
(Scotland) 20110514.1472), there were 7 confirmed cases of
Legionnaires' disease, including 3 deaths, in Greater Glasgow,
Scotland. The 2nd news release above says there are 9 cases who live
within the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and Lanarkshire health board
areas. The additional patient mentioned above may be the 10th case in
that outbreak.

We still do not know if there is a link between the cases, and we do
not know if there is a species of _Legionella_ common among the
Glasgow cases or if so, if there is a common genotype among the
isolates of the organism. The predominance of one genotype in patient
specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Frequently,
however, this is difficult in legionellosis outbreaks because the
diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease is made only on the basis of
urinary _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology,
rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory
tract specimens, in which case genotyping of clinical isolates is, of
course, not possible.

The Wishaw Sports Centre in North Lanarkshire is southeast of the
City of Glasgow

North Lanarkshire contains much of Glasgow's suburbs and commuter
towns and villages (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Lanarkshire).
Greater Glasgow, which consists of all localities that are physically
attached to the city of Glasgow, had a population of 1 199 629 at the
2001 census (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Glasgow). NHS
Greater Glasgow and Clyde is a National Health Service board in West
Central Scotland, created from the amalgamation of NHS Greater Glasgow
and part of NHS Argyll and Clyde. It is the largest health board in
the United Kingdom
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_Greater_Glasgow_and_Clyde).
