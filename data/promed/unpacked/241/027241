Fresno County's health department on Friday [17 Sep 2021] announced the 1st case of Saint Louis Encephalitis in the county this year [2021]. It's also the 1st in the state.

The mosquito-borne illness is similar to West Nile because it affects the central nervous system.

It can feel like the flu because symptoms include aches, pains and fever.

Health officials say they are most concerned about the elderly and young kids because it can cause more serious complications.

The community is urged to avoid mosquito bites as much as possible by eliminating standing water - and avoid being outdoors at dusk.

The person who was sick with the virus was treated at a Valley hospital and is expected to be okay.

[The USA CDC reports that most people infected with SLE virus have no apparent illness (https://www.cdc.gov/sle/). The 1% who become ill develop fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. Severe neuroinvasive disease (often involving encephalitis) occurs more commonly in older adults, as was the 1st case in 2020 (see St. Louis encephalitis virus - USA (02): (CA) fatal 20200905.7749005). Rarely, long-term disability or death can result. Unfortunately, there are no vaccines or medications available for human use. Avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available. - Mod.TY
