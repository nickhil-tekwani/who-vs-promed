Chikungunya is fast spreading in the Kuruwita-Erathna area
[Sabaragamuwa province], according to reports. Provincial director of
health Dr Kapila Kannangara said that nearly 150 patients were found
with chikungunya in the area.

He said it was confirmed that the chikungunya virus was present in
the blood samples that had been sent to the Colombo Medical Research
Institute for testing.

He added that steps were being taken to control the disease and the
public was advised to clean the places where mosquitoes could breed.

[Although this is the 1st report of locally transmitted chikungunya
virus in 2008 in Sri Lanka, transmission has been going on there as
indicated by a chikungunya case imported to Hong Kong from Sri Lanka
in January 2008 (see ProMED-mail no. 20080201.0398).
