This is a follow-up report on the suspected case of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in a 31-year-old veterinarian (ProMED-mail archive number 20181006.6074497, published 6 Oct 2018) who had dissected a WNV-positive owl (ProMED-mail archive number 20180914.6029586, published 14 Sep 2018) at a bird clinic in Bavaria, Germany.

We received another serum sample for examination, which the patient had drawn from himself (and since stored frozen at minus 20 deg C) 10 days after the presumed time of infection, which was 3 weeks earlier than the post-acute phase sample reported positive for WNV antibodies in our 1st posting. When the earlier sample was recovered, the clinical symptoms of the 1st episode of fever were decreasing but still present. As already reported, the patient had a history of past vaccinations against tick-borne encephalitis (TBE; during childhood) and yellow fever (YF) virus (in 2012).

We now examined the 2 serum samples in parallel and could show IgM seroconversion to WNV, along with a significant increase in IgG antibody titres against WNV and other flaviviruses between the 2 specimens. Although no IgM antibodies against WNV were detectable in the 1st serum sample by use of an indirect immunofluorescence assay, the sample recovered later showed the presence of IgM antibodies against WNV with a titre of 1:80. No IgM antibodies against dengue (DEN) virus, TBE virus, YF virus and Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus were present in either of the 2 sera. The 1st serum sample showed IgG antibody titres against WNV of 1:10 and against TBE, YF, JE and DEN viruses of 1:40, 1:10,

[ProMED thanks Dr. Zange for the confirmatory report on the human case of WNV from Bavaria, Germany.

Although molecular methods such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are very sensitive and can be used for laboratory diagnosis, the performance of these techniques may be limited for the confirmation of cases of neuroinvasive disease associated with WNV because of the low-level, transient viremia present at clinical presentation. Furthermore, the clinical presentation of fever and rash is not unique to WNV and may be observed with other viruses, such as dengue, chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis. Developing testing algorithms in accordance with local disease epidemiology can be helpful in using laboratory and treatment resources optimally.

WNV-specific IgM antibodies are usually detectable 3 to 8 days after onset of illness and persist for 30 to 90 days, although longer persistence has been documented. Therefore, positive IgM antibodies occasionally may reflect a past infection. If serum is collected within 8 days of illness onset, the absence of detectable virus-specific IgM does not rule out the diagnosis of WNV infection, and the test may need to be repeated on a later sample.

The presence of WNV-specific IgM in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides good evidence of recent infection but may also result from cross-reactive antibodies after infection with other flaviviruses or from nonspecific reactivity. CSF is the preferred sample to collect because antibody in the CSF confirms the virus has infected the nervous system. Antibody in the serum only could simply reflect recent coincidental asymptomatic WNV infection (https://www.paho.org/hq/dmdocuments/2016/WNV-Detection-and-Laboratory-Diagnosis-Dec-2016.pdf).

WNV IgG antibodies generally are detected shortly after IgM antibodies and persist for many years following a symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. Therefore, the presence of IgG antibodies alone is evidence only of previous infection, and clinically compatible cases with the presence of IgG, but not IgM, should be evaluated for other etiologic agents.

Plaque-reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) performed in reference laboratories, including some state public health laboratories and CDC, can help determine the specific infecting flavivirus. PRNTs can also confirm acute infection by demonstrating a 4-fold or greater change in WNV-specific neutralizing antibody titre between acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples collected 2 to 3 weeks apart (https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/healthcareproviders/healthCareProviders-Diagnostic.html). - Mod.UBA

[2] Corsica, France

The 1st human case of West Nile virus in Corsica, France has been reported. The person visited the island on holiday and then moved there from Alpes-Maritimes. In addition, 2 horses were reported with the virus in Upper Corsica. The regional health agency (ARS) renews its message of prevention against mosquito bites: "Fight against breeding sites (eliminate stagnant water), [and] use repellents recommended by pharmacists."

Vigilance against mosquito bites is more necessary than ever, as the ARS of Corsica confirms that a person on holiday on the island is currently being treated for West Nile fever, a virus transmitted by the _Culex_ mosquito (the most common, which stings morning, noon and night).

No information has been issued on the patient's current state of health. "We know that this is a person who came on holiday [to] Corsica around [17-18 Sep 2018] and then moved on the island from the Alpes-Maritimes. [As the incubation time of the disease] is between 3 and 15 days, it is very likely that [the person] was bitten by a mosquito in Paca, where there are currently 22 confirmed human cases. The person then developed the symptoms here in Corsica. [I] cannot say that the person was not infected on the island," says Joseph Magnavacca, the director of public health and medico-social at the ARS of Corsica. Therefore, the probability that the virus is autochthonous exists but cannot be verified.

West Nile virus affects the nervous system, but "in most cases, the human infection of West Nile is asymptomatic," i.e., the patient has no symptoms or a mild flulike condition (fever, pain, headache), explains Dr. Anne-Marie McKenzie, doctor of watch and health safety at the ARS of Corsica. "[Thus, the infection often passes unnoticed, but in some rare cases, as for this holidaymaker, the infection is much more serious and affects the nervous system]."

Known by epidemiologists since the 1960s, this virus is transmitted to mosquitoes by migratory birds in sub-Saharan Africa. The insect that stings the infected bird then transmits the disease to the horse (a relatively frequent case and is subject to epidemiological surveillance; as noted above, 2 horses have recently developed the disease in Upper Corsica) or, more rarely, to humans.

But since this summer [2018], the Mediterranean region has been hit by increased numbers of human cases. In addition to the 22 confirmed cases in Paca, 1300 infected persons were recently reported in Europe. A total of 3 persons died this summer in the Ferrara region of Italy from West Nile fever. "This year, we are actually seeing a much earlier and more severe circulation of the virus throughout the Mediterranean," says Dr. McKenzie.

But the good news is that unlike other arboviroses, such as chikungunya, dengue or Zika, humans and horses are "accidental hosts." "The latter are epidemiological dead ends," says the doctor of the ARS, "that is to say that they cannot transmit the virus. A mosquito that would bite an infected person cannot carry the virus and infect another person, which significantly reduces the chain of contamination."

To limit the risk of an epidemic, the ARS renews its message of prevention: "The only thing to do is to protect oneself from mosquitoes. We must be vigilant, prevent [the mosquitoes] from proliferating by fighting against their roosting and using repellents."

[Potentially serious illnesses that can be confused with West Nile virus infection include the following:

- Other viruses can also cause meningitis or encephalitis, including herpes simplex encephalitis, varicella-zoster encephalitis, Dengue fever, Powassan virus infection, St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, or encephalitis due to an enterovirus.
- Several tickborne diseases can produce illnesses that may be indistinguishable from West Nile infections, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, and ehrlichiosis.
- Bacterial meningitis with pneumococcus or meningococcus can look just like any other meningitis, including meningitis caused by West Nile virus.

Many of these infections require treatment with specific antibiotics. For this reason, it is critical to make a precise diagnosis whenever somebody has a serious illness that might (or might not) turn out to be due to West Nile virus. - Mod.UBA
