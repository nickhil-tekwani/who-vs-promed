HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS & ANAL CANCER - DENMARK, SWEDEN

Boston news media have reported that this week's New England Journal of
Medicine (337:1350-1358) includes a report from Morten Frisch et al.
entitled "Sexually Transmitted Infection as a Cause of Anal Cancer."
The authors noted that the incidence of anal cancer has increased in recent
decades, especially among females. They collected data from patients and
controls in Denmark and Sweden via telephone interviews with anal cancer
patients (324 women and 93 men diagnosed between 1991 and 1994) and
compared the results to those from 534 controls with adenocarcinoma of the
rectum and 554 healthy population controls. For women, the authors report
an association between higher numbers of heterosexual partners (p<0.001),
and the risk was further increased for women who reported being receptive
for anal intercourse prior to the age of 30 years. A similar trend was
observed for men (p<0.05) and especially for those reporting homosexual
contacts (p<0.001).
Anal cancer tissues and rectal adenocarcinomas were tested for the presence
of human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA using the polymerase chain reaction to
amplify the number of copies. HPV DNA was detected in 84% of anal cancer
tissues, while none of the rectal adenocarcinoma samples were positive. The
authors conclude that this provides strong evidence that a sexually
transmitted infection by HPV (especially HPV-16 from PCR studies), causes
anal cancer, and that much of this disease may be preventable.
