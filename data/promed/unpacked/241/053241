CLASSICAL SWINE FEVER IN SPAIN: Zoning
---------------------------------------
See also: 29 Jun 2001, 22 Jun 2001, 15 Jun 2001
Translation of information received on 27 Jun 2001 from Dr. Ignacio Sanchez
Esteban, Deputy Director General of Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, Madrid:
The Standing Veterinary Committee (SVC) of the European Union, which met on
22 Jun 2001, issued a favorable opinion on the draft Decision concerning
certain protection measures against classical swine fever in Spain in
derogation of Decision 2001/457/EC.
This Decision prohibits the export of live pigs, as well as porcine
embryos, ova and semen, from the Catalan provinces of Tarragona, Lerida and
Girona, from the Valencian province of Castellon de la Plana and from the
veterinary districts of Binefar, Fraga and Tamarite de Litera, in the
province of Huesca. This measure will remain in force until at least 15
July 2001. The remainder of Spanish territory is free from restrictions on
the movement of live pigs and porcine embryos, ova and semen, as the SVC
considers that there is no risk of the disease spreading, either within
Spain or to other Member States, due to the wider use of zoning measures to
deal with the classical swine fever outbreak in Spain.
