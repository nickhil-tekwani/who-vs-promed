[4] Norway (Troms and Finnmark): white-tailed eagle, HPAI H5
Date: Fri 23 Dec 2022

https://wahis.woah.org/#/in-review/4795


The event started on 14 Dec 2022. A total of one outbreak (submitted) has been reported to date [24 Dec 2022]. HPAI H5 was confirmed in a white-tailed eagle in Tromso, Troms and Finnmark.

Epidemiological comments: According to the Norwegian Veterinary Laboratory, the test was only weakly positive for HPAI H5, and because of the small amount of virus, the result from subtyping for neuraminidase would be uncertain. The laboratory will likely not follow up with more tests, the sample will end up as H5. Since Norway has not reported other events without a NA type, Norway considers this strain as a new strain in the country.

Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
