As cases of SARS continue to decline, areas that have brought the
disease under control, often at great cost, are now seeking ways to
protect these hard-won gains against the hazards of imported cases.
Because even a single new case could spark another outbreak, it is
important for national authorities to remain vigilant even as current
numbers of probable cases are diminishing.
Officials from Singapore and Malaysia met today at Woodlands, a
Singapore border checkpoint, to strengthen cross-border efforts aimed
at containing the spread of SARS. Officials from both countries
agreed that travellers detected with fever at the land checkpoint
would be isolated and subsequently sent back to their point of
embarkation. The Singaporean and Malaysian delegations agreed to
update each other on health screening measures introduced at land,
air, and sea checkpoints. Singapore has also announced that it will
continue all current pre-departure screening measures until the
regional SARS situation improves.
In addition, since the start of the SARS outbreak, when it became
apparent that travel could spread the disease globally, WHO has
collaborated with non-governmental organizations such as the
International Air Transport Association and the International Civil
Aviation Organization to promote the adoption of measures aimed at
preventing the spread of SARS via air travel.
Singapore's Changi International Airport will soon become the world's
first airport to implement new measures to guard against the spread
of SARS, in accordance with procedures set out by the International
Civil Aviation Organization. Changi was chosen as the test case
partly due to Singapore's rapid response to SARS; it was the first
airport to introduce thermal scanners to screen passengers for
fevers. Since then, Singapore has also provided such scanners on loan
to Toronto for use in that city's airport exit screening.
If Changi is determined to take all the necessary steps in accordance
with the International Civil Aviation Organization guidelines, which
are in turn based on WHO recommendations, the airport will receive a
certificate. The global aviation body is readying a scheme to
evaluate how well airports enforce anti-SARS measures, which include
specific procedures for screening passengers and airport workers. The
measures also include distributing SARS information to passengers and
guidance on handling suspected cases already on board aircraft and at
their destinations.

On 31 May 2003, WHO removed Singapore from the list of countries with
recent local transmission of SARS. As a scientist who had been
involved since the beginning of the SARS outbreak in Singapore and
who is still part of the current investigation, I wish to comment on
2 points that were brought up in ProMED-mail dated Fri 30 May 2003,
entitled "SARS-worldwide (126)."
(1) Singapore used its military forces to assist in contact tracing
and enforcement of home quarantine. In addition to the above,
Singapore also used military-related Research Institutes to assist in
the investigation of the SARS epidemic and to provide diagnostic
testing for SARS clinical samples. In mid-March 2003, the Defense
Medical Research Institute (DMRI) commenced the SARS investigation
together with the Virology Unit from the Singapore General Hospital.
Another military-related Research Institute which came on later in
the outbreak investigation was the DSO National Laboratories
[information on the DSO laboratories can be found at the following
URL <http://www.dso.org.sg/>. It is a not-for-profit research and
development organization that works with the military in Singapore].
(2) Management of the outbreak benefited from support from
high-quality laboratory services. The Virology Unit of the Singapore
General Hospital [SGH] is our front-line national laboratory,
providing virological testing for a wide range of pathogens. However,
in the situation of the SARS outbreak in Singapore, a number of other
laboratories formed these "high-quality laboratory services"
mentioned in point 2.
In mid-March 2003, right from the beginning, and before the
etiological finding that the unusual atypical pneumonia was caused by
SARS, DMRI was already working alongside the Virology Unit of SGH.
Although DMRI was not an official member of the WHO laboratory
network, information was released by WHO through the Virology Unit of
SGH. The results from DMRI were fed back to the WHO in the same
manner. On 24 Mar 2003, WHO released the CDC primers for [the
SARS-associated] coronavirus, and 3 days later we used the primers to
obtain a positive PCR reaction from a primary contact of the first
index case. DNA sequencing revealed 100 percent match with the
nucleotide sequence from the Bangkok index case. By then, positive
PCR reactions and Coronavirus-like sequences using the Germany
primers BNIoutS2 and BNIoutAs were also obtained. Up to this point in
the SARS investigations, we had a lot of assistance and advice from
Christian Drosten, Germany, and Leo Poon, HongKong, on the various
aspects of PCR reactions.
The findings were presented in the WHO meeting on SARS Etiology and
Diagnosis: Current Status and Future Development, on 16 Apr 2003 in
Geneva. The Virology unit in SGH also attempted to isolate the SARS
virus in a range of cell lines including Vero cells provided by DMRI
while waiting for the shipment of Vero E6 to arrive from CDC,
Atlanta. These were the isolates that were used for sequencing of the
complete virus genomes (The Lancet, published online May 2003).
Like all other scientists involved in the SARS investigation, DMRI
also explored the possibility of co-infection with a metapneumovirus
and found no evidence whatsoever for it. By then the SARS epidemic
had become a crisis not only in Singapore, but worldwide. Colleagues
from the Infectious Disease group in DMRI stopped all research work
immediately. Initial attempts to sequence the virus from infected
Vero cell cultures were also put aside as the group reorganised
itself into a full-scale diagnostic laboratory to fulfill our
nation's needs.
On 26 Apr 2003, the Singapore SARS Clinical Consortium was officially
formed. The first objective of the consortium was to ensure that
healthcare and research laboratories in Singapore could undertake
diagnostic testing of the SARS clinical samples. By then, the volume
of clinical samples submitted for SARS testing had exceeded the
capacity of the laboratories then involved. Various laboratories in
Singapore were drawn into the consortium; these were from the 3
hospitals -- National University Hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital,
and of course, Virology Unit in SGH; and from 5 Research Institutes,
DMRI, DSO National Laboratories (who also reorganised into a
diagnostic laboratory), Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (who
assisted the diagnostic setup in Tan Tock Seng Hospital), Singapore
Genomic Institute (who took over the sequencing of virus genomes),
and the National Environment Agency (who prepared the virus antigens
for serological testing).
However, we must not forget the contribution from non-members of the
SARS consortium. They include the clinicians and nurses who risk
infection to collect the best clinical specimens; our special courier
service involved in the logistics of sample distribution; and lastly
our colleagues from the National University of Singapore, who
assisted during the early days of the investigation with Electron
Microscopy (Electron Microscopy unit), and optimisation of the PCR
primers for diagnostic testing (Department of Microbiology). Together
with members of the SARS Consortium, they contributed to the
'high-quality laboratory services'.

[A] Taiwan from Japan Today 7 Jun 2003
<http://www.japantoday.com/e/?content=news&cat=7&id=262355>

A hospital in Taipei on Friday reported 6 new cases of SARS, raising
concerns of a new outbreak after a 3-day lull, the Health Ministry
said. The infection, involving 3 patients and 3 health workers,
occurred at Taipei Municipal Yang Ming Hospital, health officials
said. Officials said the hospital closed its emergency service Friday
night for disinfection and put 54 hospital workers on quarantine for
14 days.
[B] Canada from Canadian Broadcasting Company 6 Jun 2003
<http://www.cbc.ca/cp/world/030606/w060668.html>
Toronto's effort to contain the disease was dealt a frightening blow
Friday with news that a medical resident came down with SARS just
hours after working on an obstetrics ward where he helped deliver a
set of twins and had contact with 3 other babies. The case raises
questions about the safety of quarantine rules, because the resident
began displaying symptoms 12 days after being exposed to the virus --
not the internationally accepted incubation period of 10 days.
5 women who had close contact with the resident have been sent home
to go into quarantine. 4 have given birth to a total of 5 babies.
They have been instructed to keep their newborns with them and to
isolate themselves from other family members. In addition, 20 other
women who were on the ward have been sent home and told to monitor
their health, and about 100 staff members have been affected: 50 are
going into quarantine and another 50 are under surveillance.
[C] Thailand ex Taiwan from Canadian Broadcasting Company 6 Jun 2003
<http://www.cbc.ca/cp/world/030606/w060668.html>
In Thailand, a 38-year-old woman was diagnosed with SARS after
returning from Taiwan where she worked as a labourer. She was
admitted to a Thai hospital 29 May 2003 with a cough, sore throat,
fever, and aches. Another 19 people who came in contact with the
woman are under the care of public health officials, but none has
shown any symptoms of SARS, the health ministry said.

ProMED-mail
<promed@promedmail.org>
[As of 6 Jun 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 8404 probable
cases of SARS with 779 deaths reported from 29 countries. In the
past 24 hours there have been 9 new reports of probable cases of
which 4 were reported from Canada, 2 were reported from Hong Kong,
and 1 each were reported from China, Taiwan, and the United States.
Newswire reports suggest there may be a new cluster in Taiwan at a
hospital not previously reported to have had cases. Other news items
relate to a physician who may have SARS with an incubation period of
12 days (in Canada) and a possible newly imported case in Thailand
from Taiwan. The latter case is a reminder of the need to maintain a
high index of suspicion for the possibility of imported cases. As
for the former, we await more details from official sources. -
