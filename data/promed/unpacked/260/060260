Humans may have been contaminated by a bovine disease
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 8 people are suspected of contamination with a bovine
disease in the city of West Figueiropolis [Mato Grosso]. According to
TV Centro America, in Araputanga [MT] there were an additional 25
cases of contamination reported. A person infected with the disease
does not have any risk of dying. The symptoms usually appear 12 days
after contamination [infection]. Apart from the lesions that are
caused by contact with the animal (infected animal), the infected
person suffers from strong headaches, body pains and high fever during 3 days.

There is serious concern about fighting an outbreak of bovine variola
[vaccinia] because the disease can be transmitted person to person.
Bovine variola [vaccinia] is transmitted between cattle farms by the
introduction of sick animals into the herd and through the action of
milking these sick cows and then doing the same at other farms.
Unlike FMD [foot and mouth disease] where animals are slaughtered,
cattle with bovine variola [vaccinia] are treated symptomatically
with antibiotics.

"If there isn't control, there is no way to prevent the disease as it
spreads easily. An infected person can infect others, in addition to
the affected animal," said Jociane Quixabeira, the veterinarian from
Indea. She is a member of the technical committee responsible for
disease outbreaks in the State.

[The vaccinia virus used in the eradication of human smallpox can
naturally spread in some domestic animals (e.g., cattle and
laboratory rabbits). Vaccinia virus was transmitted by milkers to
cattle and in reverse from infected cattle to milkers during the
period when vaccinia virus was employed in the eradication of
smallpox. The current situation in South America is unique in that a
self-sustaining zoonotic disease has emerged mainly in cattle in
Brazil, and several genetically distinct strains of vaccinia virus
have emerged. Outbreaks of bovine vaccinia virus disease caused by
circulation of these vaccinia virus strains have been a common
occurrence in Brazil in the recent years, becoming an important
emergent zoonosis. Some of these strains have acquired separate
identities (e.g., Passatempo virus), but they are all thought to be
derived from the Brazilian smallpox vaccine strain (VV-IOC) used over
20 years ago.

It is clear from that above report that exposure to vaccinia virus
infected cattle remains a problem in some parts of Brazil and an
information campaign may be required to raise awarness of the disease
and to reduce exposure of humans to infection.

Grosso in the centre of the country.

For the non-virologist, the genus _Orthopoxvirus_ comprises 8
distinct virus species: _Camelpox virus_, _Cowpox virus_,
_Ectromelia virus_, _Monkeypox virus_, _Raccoonpox virus_, _Taterapox
virus_, _Vacciniavirus_ and _Volepox virus_, plus the eradicated
_Variola (smallpox) virus_. The virus species responsible for this
outbreak is _Vaccinia virus_, not _Cowpox virus_, which is a rodent
poxvirus not previously isolated outside Europe. - Mod.CP]
