The first case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)-like lesions in
German ostriches occurred in 1986 and the last of the 3 cases in 1989, but
no published report appeared until 1991 (abstract and comment Vet Rec 1991;
Sep 21: 254). References to this condition in ostriches were frequently
cited in reviews of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) --
(for example: Bradley & Matthews. Res Sci tech Off Int Epizoot 1992; 11(2):
605-34; Hart. J Med Microbiol 1995; 42: 153-5; Schreuder. Vet Quart 1994;
16(3): 174-81.
No fresh or frozen brain tissue was available for SAF analysis. The lesions
were described as encephalopathy. The figures in Schoon et al (Tierarztl
Prax 1991; 19: 263) show variable sized intraneuronal (perikarya) vacuoles
and vacuoles in the neuropil (brain background). Some are large and single,
others are smaller and multiple. There appears to be little, if any,
gliosis associated with the lesions. The authors comment that the lesion is
compared to the TSEs in the context of differential diagnosis. As I
understand the ProMED-mail postings, the fixed tissues were stained for
mammalian (BSE) PrP and found to be negative. But as that test has probably
not been validated for ostriches, I would be loathe to overinterpret it. We
know that PrP morphology, and therefore immunostaining specificity, is to
some extent host species-specific.
Following Evans' postulates on association of causation (Yale J Biol Med
1976; 49: 175-95), is there any possible epidemiological association of
ostriches and BSE? Potentially yes. It was/still is (depending upon
country) permissible to feed ruminant-derived meat and bone meal to certain
classes of livestock, such as poultry, as a protein supplement. Ratites
[flightless birds such as ostriches and kiwis. Mod.SH are fed proprietary
ratite (poultry) feeds or, in some cases, given feeds formulated for turkey
or broiler chickens. Commercially harvested ratites are usually 6-9 months
of age, but adults are kept for many years. The German cases were elderly
adults from a zoo, and had been fed a varied omnivorous diet including some
meat scraps. The first German ostrich case had a serious arteriosclerosis
lesion which would probably have compromised the circulation.
Has there been adequate surveillance of ostriches with nervous signs in the
United Kingdom, and ratites elsewhere, to know if a condition such as this
could be out there somewhere? If so, where is it? What is it? To my
knowledge, a TSE-like disease has not been transmitted to nor described in
domestic fowl. Poultry inoculated with BSE-derived material were not
affected with a TSE-like encephalopathy (Cawthorne Vet Rec 1997; Aug 23: 203).
In the recent neurotrophic virulent Newcastle disease outbreak in NSW,
Australia, we did not examine the brains of any ratites, but we did examine
the brains of thousands of other birds, mainly young broilers. We saw no
lesions in any of these birds which resembled those in the German ostriches.
We have examined the brains of a few ostriches, however, and in one (aged 4
months, suffering from fading ostrich chick syndrome) we observed a few
intraneuronal vacuoles in one brain stem nucleus. The vacuoles were not
found on reblocking of the tissue. It is best described as an intraneuronal
vacuolation rather than spongiform encephalopathy, as the latter has a lot
more sensitivity in this day and age.
Australia is free of TSEs, but one case of feline spongiform encephalopathy
has been reported from Western Australia, in a cheetah imported from the UK.
The characteristic lesions of TSE are vacuolation of the grey matter
neuropil, vacuolation of neuronal perikarya, neuronal degeneration and
loss, and associated gliosis. However, vacuolation of neuronal perikarya is
not restricted to the TSEs. Intracytoplasmic vacuoles in the neurons of the
red nucleus in cattle and goats are common in normal animals and therefore
also in those showing any nervous clinical disorder as well as those with
BSE. A similar situation probably pertains to other species, including
avians and possibly ostriches.
Fine neuronal vacuolation occurs in ischaemia due to swelling of the
mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, and also in acute injury from
viruses, toxic and metabolic derangements (Summers, et al. Veterinary
Neuropathology, Mosby 1994; Jubb and Huxtable. The Nervous System. In: Jubb
et al. Pathology of Domestic Animals, 4th ed, vol 1, Academic Press). A
review of incidental lesions in sheep [Hooper Aust Vet J 1999; 77: 398
describes non-scrapie-associated vacuolation. Storage diseases can result
in vacuolation of neurons.
Therefore, adequate normal brains need to be examined from any
species/age/nutritional status etc. before too many conclusions or comments
are made. For examples, see neuronal vacuoles in raccoons [Hamir et al. Vet
Path 1997; 34: 250, neuronal vacuoles in woodchuck [Pierce et al. J
Wildlife Dis 1990; 26: 62, artefacts [Garman. Toxicol Pathol 1990; 18:
149. 'Idiopathic' neuronal degeneration and vacuolation have been recorded
in avian species such as the eagle owl (Randall and Reece, Color Atlas of
Avian Histopathology, Mosby Wolfe 1996), but no morphologically similar
lesions were observed in the cases reported by Hartley and Reece (Aust Vet
Pract 1997; 27(2): 91-6).
NOTE: We presented a paper (Reece et al 2000, A wander through birds'
brains. Proceedings Annual Meeting Aust Soc Vet Path) which included more
than 100 transparencies. These have been burnt into a CD and we are in the
final stages of completing the footnotes. This includes a figure of the
ostrich neuronal vacuolation.
