The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today [Mon 20 Nov 2017] received notification of an additional human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in Guangxi from the National Health and Family Planning Commission, and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

The case was a 33 year old man from Guiyang. He developed symptoms on [7 Nov 2017] and was hospitalised on [Sun 12 Nov 2017]. He is now in a critical condition. The patient had contact with live poultry and exposure to live poultry markets before the onset of symptoms.

"Based on the seasonal pattern of avian influenza viruses, their activity in the mainland is expected to increase in winter. The public should avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings and should not visit live poultry markets and farms to prevent avian influenza," a spokesman for the CHP said.

From 2014 to date [Mon 20 Nov 2017], 17 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by the mainland health authorities. "All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong," the spokesman said.

Travellers to mainland China or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.

Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

While local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments. The CHP's Port Health Office conducts health surveillance measures at all boundary control points. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up.

The display of posters and broadcasting of health messages in departure and arrival halls as health education for travellers is under way. The travel industry and other stakeholders are regularly updated on the latest information.

The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below if handling poultry:
- avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;
- when buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;
- eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;
- wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and
- wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.

The public may visit the CHP's pages for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly avian influenza report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook page and the YouTube channel.

[According to WHO, which continues to closely monitor the avian influenza A(H5N6) virus and other zoonotic influenza events through its Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), so far the overall public health risk associated with the avian influenza A(H5N6) virus has not changed.

Even though avian influenza A(H5N6) viruses have caused severe infection in humans, most human infections with the virus seem to be sporadic with no ongoing human-to-human transmission. However the specific risk associated with the virus strains infecting the reported cases will be assessed when the viruses are received and characterized in the GISRS laboratories.

The risk of international disease spread is considered to be low at this point in time. WHO continues to assess the epidemiological situation and conduct further risk assessment based on the latest information, http://www.who.int/csr/don/07-december-2016-ah5n6-china/en/. - Mod.UBA
