Rabies outbreak in Energodar city
---------------------------------
Basements of apartments in Energodar city are being disinfested from
rats and mice. By the end of the month veterinarians should have
vaccinated all domestic animals against rabies. The reason for these
measures is the result of capture of a rat by taxi drivers. One of
the taxi drivers was attacked by a rat that appeared on on the street
outside an apartment block. The rat was killed and brought for
investigation. Subsequently it was confirmed that the rat had rabies.
The taxi driver [who was attacked] will be getting anti-rabies shots,
while 2 neighborhoods will be under quarantine.

According to Valentina Stulova, the head of the veterinary
department, these measures are being undertaken to prevent the spread
of rabies. However it is not considered an emergency situation. These
measures are standard practice and there is no threat for the
population. However it is quite rare to have rabid rats in this
region since usually rabies is associated with feral and abandoned
dogs. One case of rabies in a bat has been recorded in this region.
Nonetheless strict surveillance will be maintained for 2 months.

[Rabid rats attacking people is rare in this region. Fortunately
prompt action has prevented further human exposure. According to OIE
there were 8 cases of rabies in Russia in 2007. - Mod.NR]

[Rabies is rarely reported in rats, and rodents are these animals are
unlikely to the primary source of this outbreak. In a city
environment rabies-infected dogs and cats are more likely to be the
primary source of the infection. The city of Energodar is in the
Ukraine and can be located in the interactive map at:

[At first it is difficult to perceive how a rat would acquire a
rabies infection. If attacked by another rabid mammal the rat would
come off 2nd, i.e dead , even if it did not acquire an overwhelming
infection resulting in a rapid death. Being bitten by another rat
does not solve the question either. This leaves us with the
possibility it found a moribund rabid bat and ate it, just as cats do
and with the same result. It would be interesting to know if the
Ukraine authorities have attempted to type the rat virus and thus
identify a possible source in this unusual case. - Mod. MHJ]
