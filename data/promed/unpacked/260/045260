National public health officials in Finland are monitoring the situation following local reports of _Yersinia_ outbreaks. 2 outbreaks of _Y. enterocolitica_ serotype O:3 have been reported to the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) in recent weeks from the South Savo and Helsinki-Uusimaa regions. Another suspected outbreak has been recorded in the Pirkanmaa region but patient samples have not been serotyped. People fell sick between early and mid-February 2022.

A total of 39 cases were noted in all of Finland in February 2022, which is less than the 55 infections in February 2021. In February 2022, 5 cases of _Y. enterocolitica_ from South Savo were reported to the Infectious Diseases Register, which is run by THL, while from 2019 to 2021 there were no illnesses at the same time. THL does not routinely monitor the occurrence of _Yersinia_ infections, and strains isolated from patients are not routinely submitted to the agency's reference laboratory for typing.

Local food safety authorities report suspected foodborne outbreaks to the National Registry for Food and Waterborne Outbreaks, maintained by the Finnish Food Authority (Ruokavirasto) and THL. THL asked hospital and regional agencies to monitor the local situation and report suspected foodborne outbreaks. The agency also requested clinical laboratories to submit patient isolates related to outbreaks so they can be typed and to include _Y. enterocolitica_ serotype and biotype information, if available. Between 1995 and 2018, 13 344 _Y. enterocolitica_ cases were reported in Finland with an annual variation of 414 to 876 infections.

[The source or sources of the clusters of _Y. enterocolitica_ and whether the different clusters are related are not stated.

The 2 species of _Yersinia_ associated with foodborne disease are _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and _Y. enterocolitica_. The latter species can be associated with abdominal pain as a hallmark symptom. As a mesenteric lymphadenitis, yersiniosis can mimic appendicitis but may also cause infections of other sites, such as wounds, joints, and the urinary tract.

As noted in the FDA "Bad Bug Book" (https://bit.ly/3pmDJN1): "Strains of _Y. enterocolitica_ can be found in meats (pork, beef, lamb, etc.), oysters, fish, and raw milk. The exact cause of the food contamination is unknown. However, the prevalence of this organism in soil, water, and animals, such as beavers, pigs, and squirrels, offers ample opportunities for it to enter our food supply. Poor sanitation and improper sterilization techniques by food handlers, including improper storage, cannot be overlooked as contributing to contamination."

In addition, some strains of these organisms can be associated with blood transfusion-associated illnesses due to an ability to grow at refrigerator temperatures. - Mod.LL
