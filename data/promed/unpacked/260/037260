A report submitted today [7 Oct 2019] by Dr. Zohar Geva reveals an outbreak of turkey (viral) meningoencephalitis (TME) in a turkey flock in southern Israel. According to the report, there are probably additional TME outbreaks that remain unreported. An attempt to trace TME events in the field has revealed a considerable number of clinically suspected cases, unreported and not lab-investigated for confirmation.

Although viral TME is included in Israel's official list of animal diseases [registered as "Meningoencephalitis meleagridis"], on top of the prescribed notification as spelled out in the Animal Diseases Ordinance, 1985, there are professional and epidemiologic considerations justifying full diagnosis and data collection. If there is indeed underreporting, we all lose.

In addition, unfortunately the Kimron Veterinary Institute has discontinued for the past several months the supply of TM antigen, required for serological tests, to the regional poultry health laboratories. Such tests are required for diagnosis and vaccination status monitoring.

[Turkey meningoencephalitis (TME), a neuroparalytic disease of turkeys that, under field conditions, affected birds older than 10 weeks, was 1st described in Israel in 1960 (1).

A live-attenuated vaccine against TME was developed in 1975 and has remained in use in Israel to present with satisfactory results (2). The disease in Israel presents a seasonal pattern; several arthropods have been suggested as its vectors (3).

During 1978, a similar disease, affecting turkeys, was observed in South Africa, shown to be caused by an identical flavivirus (4).

In 2014, an Israeli-Spanish paper addressed the identity between the Bagaza virus (BAGV) and TME (5). The study presented a phylogenetic comparison of BAGV and TME virus (ITV) with other complete sequences of flaviviruses in the Ntaya serogroup, concluding that "BAGV and ITV are the same virus species".

BAGV was initially isolated in 1966 from mosquitoes in Bagaza, Central African Republic and later from mosquitoes in other Western African countries, as well as in India, where serological evidence suggested its ability to infect humans, although its pathogenicity is still uncertain. Until 2009, BAGV/TME was restricted to Africa, India and Israel, but in 2010 it emerged for the 1st time in Europe, causing an outbreak in game birds in southern Spain with high mortality rates in partridges and pheasants.
