Infectious salmon anaemia virus (HPR-deleted or HPR0 genotypes) (Infection with), Norway
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 27 Nov 2014 from Dre Kristina Landsverk, Chief Veterinary Officer, Norwegian Food Safety Authority, Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Brumunddal, Norway

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 24 Nov 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 24 Nov 2014
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: infectious salmon anemia virus
Serotype: HPR-deleted
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (basic), laboratory (advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 (2014/8): Finnstein 11353, Torsken, Midt Troms, Troms
Date of start of the outbreak: 24 Nov 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Water type: salt water
Population type: wild
Production system: semi-open
Total animals affected:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / 2 (scale 0 to 5) / 2 (scale 0 to 5) / 1 158 549 / 2530 / 142 817 / 0
Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / 0.24 percent / 0.22 percent / 89.40 percent / 12.55 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: The ISA virus at Finnstein-11353 is verified as a deleted, virulent variant based on sequence analysis of ISAV HPR (segment 6). From an epidemiological point of view, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority considers the ISA outbreak at Finnstein-11353 likely to be a 1st occurrence. Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) was present at another location in Troms region in March 2014 as well. The previous outbreak occurred at a distance of about 250 km [about 155 miles], and these ISA cases seem to be 2 separate outbreaks without any epidemiological correlation although both of them belong to the same administrative region. The Norwegian Veterinary Institute use genotyping to determine whether ISA outbreaks are an occurrence or a reoccurrence. Genotyping based on the complete ISAV segment 6 and further epidemiological studies are required to determine if this is an isolated outbreak. This work is ongoing at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; official destruction of clinically diseased aquatic animals; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals.

Measures to be applied: zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); emergency harvest; tracing forward; tracing back; surveillance outside containment and/or buffer zone; official destruction of aquatic animal products; surveillance within containment and/or buffer zone.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
Norwegian Veterinary Institute (regional reference laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / histopathological examination / 24 Nov 2014 / positive
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / immunohistochemical test / 24 Nov 2014 / positive
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / real-time PCR / 24 Nov 2014 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Infectious salmon anaemia is now referred to as infectious salmon anaemia virus (HPR-deleted or HPR0 genotypes) (infection with): http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/oie-listed-diseases-2014/.

This is the 1st time that the serotype of the virus (in this case the HPR-deleted strain) can be included in an OIE immediate notification report.

Infection with infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) means infection with highly polymorphic region (HPR)-deleted ISAV or HPR0 ISAV (with a non-deleted HPR) of the genus _Isavirus_ of the family Orthomyxoviridae.

Infection with HPR-deleted ISAV may cause infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) in Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), which is a generalised and lethal condition characterised by severe anaemia, and variable haemorrhages and necrosis in several organs. The disease course is prolonged with low daily mortality (0.05-0.1 percent) typically only in a few cages. Cumulative mortality may become very high for a period lasting several months if nothing is done to limit disease dissemination.

Detection of HPR0 ISAV has never been associated with ISA in Atlantic salmon. This virus genotype replicates transiently and has mainly been localised to the gills. A link between non-pathogenic HPR0 ISAV and pathogenic HPR-deleted ISAV, with some outbreaks potentially occurring as a result of the emergence of HPR-deleted ISAV from HPR0 ISAV has been suggested.

For the above and additional background information including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2014, Chapter 2.3.5, Infection with Infectious Salmon Anaemia, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.3.05_ISA.pdf
(NB: version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2014).

The comments made under the "Epidemiological comments" section are noteworthy because they highlight the importance of using genotyping to distinguish viral strains. For this report, the Norwegian authorities were able to use the tool to determine that this case was not related to the case reported in March 2014 even though the events occurred in the same administrative division. As the OIE Aquatic Manual indicates, "Sequence analysis of various gene segments has revealed differences between isolates both within and between defined geographical areas" (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.3.05_ISA.pdf). - Mod.CRD
