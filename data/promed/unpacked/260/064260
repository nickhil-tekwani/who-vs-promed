The NSW [New South Wales, Australia] Food Authority is advising consumers who are most vulnerable to listeria infection -- such as older persons, and people who have weakened immune systems due to illness or pregnancy -- to avoid eating rockmelon [also called cantaloupe] after a recent spike in listeriosis cases in elderly people has been linked to the fruit. As a precaution, consumers [particularly those who are elderly, pregnant or immune compromised] who may have rockmelon already in their home are advised to discard it.

Listeria is found widely in the environment and rarely causes serious illness in the general population but for vulnerable people, such as those who are over 70, pregnant, or have diabetes, cancer or suppressed immune systems, it can be extremely serious or even life threatening.

All states and territories are working together to investigate the outbreak and to date they have identified 10 cases in elderly patients in NSW (6), Victoria (1) and Queensland (3) with onset of illness notification dates between [17 Jan and 9 Feb 2018]. All 10 cases consumed rockmelon prior to their illness.

The outbreak has been linked to a grower in Nericon NSW. The company voluntarily ceased production on [Fri 23 Feb 2018], shortly after being notified of a potential link to illness and is working proactively with the authority to further investigate how any contamination could have occurred in order to get back into production as soon as possible. Any affected product is being removed from the supply chain, so consumers can be assured rockmelons currently available on shelves are not implicated in this outbreak.

Listeriosis starts with flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea, and sometimes diarrhoea. The symptoms can take a few days or even up to 6 weeks to appear after eating contaminated produce. People at risk should consult their local doctor as early as possible should symptoms appear.

The NSW Food Authority and NSW Health will continue to work with other jurisdictions to monitor the situation.

The 6 NSW cases linked to consumption of rockmelon form only a portion of the increased listeriosis cases in NSW so far this year, with 15 people affected, mainly elderly with underlying health conditions. Vulnerable people are reminded to avoid all foods that pose a risk of listeriosis, including: pre-cut melons such as rockmelon or watermelon; pre-packed cold salads including coleslaw and fresh fruit salad; pre-cooked cold chicken, cold delicatessen meats, pâté; raw seafood, uncooked smoked seafood (such as smoked salmon); unpasteurised milk or milk products, soft cheeses (for example brie, camembert, ricotta or blue-vein); [and] sprouted seeds or raw mushrooms.

The NSW Food Authority and NSW Health are continuing investigations into other possible sources of the remaining recent listeriosis cases.

[The melon with sweet orange flesh and a rough skin, known as a cantaloupe in the USA, is called a rockmelon in much of Australia. The melons can become contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, anywhere along the chain of food production: planting, harvesting, packing, distribution, preparation and serving. All ten people in the current listeriosis outbreak in Australia ate rockmelon before they fell sick and state and territory health departments were able to pinpoint the source to a farm in Nericon, near the city of Griffith, in the New South Wales (NSW) Riverina district (http://theconversation.com/what-is-listeria-and-how-does-it-spread-in-rockmelons-92651).

A large multistate outbreak of listeriosis in the USA in 2011 that involved a total of 147 patients -- with 33 deaths attributed to listeriosis -- in 28 states was linked to whole cantaloupes grown at a farm in the US state of Colorado. _L. monocytogenes_ outbreak subtypes were isolated from difficult-to-clean equipment at a packing facility. It was suspected that a dump truck used to take deformed melons to a cattle farm could have brought listeria to this packing facility (http://blog.consumerbell.com/2011/10/19/consumer-recall-safety-fda-announces-investigation-results-from-listeria-contaminated-cantaloupe/). Farm animals can carry listeria in their intestinal tract and shed _L. monocytogenes_ in the feces. Their manure can then contaminate soil and run-off from a cattle farm. We are not told in the news report above how rockmelons in the current outbreak in Australia became contaminated.

Riverina is an agricultural region of south western NSW, Australia. A map of Australia showing the location of Nericon can be found at https://www.whereis.com/nsw/nericon-2680.
