Study notes postpartum depression in new moms early in pandemic
---------------------------------------------------------------
More than a third of new mothers early in the COVID-19 pandemic had symptoms of postpartum (after-birth) depression -- nearly triple pre-pandemic levels -- and 1 in 5 had major depressive symptoms, with symptoms for both disorders higher in women who fed their babies formula, according to a study yesterday [14 Mar 2022] in BMC Research Notes.

Researchers from the University of Michigan (U-M) School of Nursing analyzed survey data from 670 postpartum women who completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and answered other questions from February through July 2020. The team also collected demographic data that included neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, infant gestational age, and baby feeding methods.

Of the participants, 38% (256 women) screened positive for postpartum depression (score ≥ 10 or admitted to thoughts of self-harm) and 21.8% (146) screened positive for major depressive symptoms (score ≥ 13 or had self-harm thoughts). In total, 51 respondents (7.6%) said they had thoughts of self-harm.

Respondents who fed their infants formula had 92% greater odds of screening positive for postpartum depression and were 73% more likely to screen positive for major depressive symptoms compared to those who breastfed or bottle-fed with their own human milk.

The researchers also found that moms of NICU babies had 74% greater odds of screening positive for postpartum depression, and moms worried about contracting COVID-19 had 71% greater odds.

Before COVID, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 1 in 8 women experienced postpartum depression, and about 5% to 7% experienced major depressive symptoms, 1st author Clayton Shuman, PhD, MSN, RN, U-M assistant professor of nursing, said in a U-M news release.

Of the self-harm findings, Shuman said, "This is very concerning given that prior to the pandemic, Dr. Lindsay Admon and colleagues from U-M found the rate of suicidality among prenatal and postpartum patients is on the rise in the U.S."

Conclusions. "Postpartum mental health is an important but relatively overlooked outcome in the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic sequelae such as face mask mandates, fear of infection, NICU visitor restrictions, and social isolation may have helped to slow infection rates, but they may also have contributed to worse postpartum mental outcomes. More research is needed to understand how and why pandemic sequelae are associated with peripartum mental health outcomes. Health systems must ensure adequate infrastructure to support the diverse needs of peripartum patients, including educational (e.g. childbirth, breastfeeding, parenting) and psychosocial (e.g. screening and management of mental health conditions and social determinants of health) services during distracting situations like pandemics, especially as COVID-19 continues to threaten public health."

Severe COVID-19 tied to long-term depression, anxiety
-----------------------------------------------------
A new observational follow-up study in 6 European countries published in The Lancet Public Health links severe COVID-19 to long-term depression and anxiety.

University of Iceland at Reykjavik researchers led the study, which analyzed symptoms of depression, anxiety, COVID-related stress, and poor sleep quality among 247 249 adults, 4% of whom were diagnosed as having COVID-19 from 27 Mar 2020-13 Aug 2021.

Participants, who were followed up for as long as 16 months (average, 5.7), lived in Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, or the United Kingdom. Most severely ill COVID-19 patients recuperated at home, but some spent time in a hospital.

Relative to uninfected participants, COVID-19 survivors had a higher prevalence of symptoms of depression (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.18, or 18% higher) and poor sleep quality (1.13) but not anxiety (0.97) or COVID-related distress (1.05).

The prevalence of depression and COVID-related distress lessened over time, but COVID-19 survivors who weren't bedridden during their illness were at consistently lower risk of depression (PR, 0.83) and anxiety (0.77) than their uninfected peers. COVID-19 survivors bedridden for more than 7 days (22.3% of infected patients), however, were at persistently higher risk for depression (PR, 1.61) and anxiety (1.43) than uninfected participants throughout the study period.

"Severe acute COVID-19 illness -- indicated by extended time bedridden -- is associated with long-term mental morbidity among recovering individuals in the general population," the researchers wrote. "These findings call for increased vigilance of adverse mental health development among patients with a severe acute disease phase of COVID-19."

Time spent bedridden key factor
-------------------------------
Many pandemic-related factors could have contributed to worsened mental health, the researchers said. Examples include fear of having infected others, media coverage of the long-term effects of infection, severe COVID-19 and related inflammatory processes, and personal vulnerability to mental illness.

In a Lancet press release, lead author Ingibjorg Magnusdottir, MSc, of the University of Iceland, said that the long-term physical effects of long COVID may mean limited social contact and may cause a sense of helplessness.

"Equally, inflammatory responses among patients with a severe diagnosis may contribute to more persistent mental health symptoms," she said. "In contrast, the fact that individuals with a mild COVID-19 infection can return to normal lives sooner and only experience a benign infection likely contributes to the lower risk of negative mental health effects we observed."

The researchers said that continued clinical vigilance with survivors of severe COVID-19 and follow-up beyond the first year of symptoms are warranted.

Senior author Unnur Anna Valdimarsdottir, PhD, of the University of Iceland, said, "Our research is among the first to explore mental health symptoms after a serious COVID-19 illness in the general population up to 16 months after diagnosis.

"It suggests that mental health effects aren't equal for all COVID-19 patients and that time spent bedridden is a key factor in determining the severity of the impacts on mental health."

Lancet press release: https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/946200

The authors claim this "study is the first to report disease severity as an important modifier of long-term mental health among individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis in the general population across 6 countries....

The existing literature suggests that the elevated relative risks of mental morbidities are not limited to COVID-19 but have also been reported after other previous pandemic infections."

Summary
• First study to look at long-term mental health implications for patients who were bedridden for over 7 days following a diagnosis of COVID-19, based on data from 6 countries.
• Overall, most mental health symptoms among recovering COVID-19 patients subsided within 2 months after diagnosis. But patients who were bedridden for 7 days or more were more likely to experience depression and anxiety over the 16-month study period.
• Researchers investigated symptom-prevalence of depression, anxiety, COVID-19 related distress, and poor sleep quality among people with and without a diagnosis.
• Patients with mild COVID-19 disease were less likely to have depression and anxiety than those never diagnosed. - Mod.LK]

[3] China: tipping point
Date: Tue 15 March 2022
Source: Medriva [abridged, edited]
https://medriva.com/china-at-a-covid-tipping-point/


China at a COVID Tipping Point
------------------------------
... As of today, mainland China has city-wide COVID-19 lockdowns in effect in:
• Shenzhen (12.5 million)
• Dongguan (10.5 million)
• Langfang (5.5 million)
• Whole-province-wide lockdown in Jilin (24 million),
• Partial-lockdown restriction in Shanghai (26 million)
• And in Xian (13 million)

Altogether, there's currently over 50 million residents of major cities under strict, stay at home, lockdown, plus almost 40 million more in partial lockdown, plus additional smaller medium cities also in varying degrees of lockdown. Thus, well over 90 million people in China have their daily activities restricted because of the new COVID surge. As result, China's stock market so far this week has seen some of the largest drops in recent memory...

So what is causing it?
----------------------
Most of the China and HK surges are BA2. BA2, while a subvariant of omicron, is very different from BA1 original omicron, and it has shown superior fitness to old BA1 in multiple countries, with a 80-90% transmission advantage per week based on BA2 growth in the US. Notably, in England, cases are surging across every age group, and both cases and hospitalizations are surging, as BA2 is now over 50% dominant. Moreover, BA2 is showing 25-30% higher secondary attack rates both within household and non-household settings, according to UK data. That bodes poorly as it shows faster transmission of BA2.

We have to assume China knows all this, as its health officials generally know more than they reveal. They've begun to build extra surge hospitals recently too -- in Jilin, one 6000-bed isolation center is being constructed 24 hours a day, with goal to complete it in just 6 days! China has also recently approved rapid antigen testing. They had resisted for over 26 months. Something is very different now. Indeed, Shenzhen health official Lin Hancheng warned that this BA2 strain is "highly contagious, spreads quickly and has a high degree of concealment", which can lead to widespread community transmission if control measures are not strengthened soon. This "high concealment" statement has never been used during the 2 year pandemic before and likely suggests something about BA2 that Chinese officials have realized. We should take it seriously.

The outbreak is still early in China, but the surge is near vertical so far -- and that bodes very poorly. The fact that it's simultaneously happening with lockdowns in multiple cities at once shows an urgency that we haven't seen before. Furthermore, China isn't alone in this mess. South Korea is also seeing an epic surge -- now surpassing all-time pandemic highs. And as expected, South Korea also has surging BA2 levels, now 31% of all variants detected in the country and rising fast. If South Korea also follows HK's fate, then that may also be horrible for the global crisis.

Meanwhile, Western European leaders have naively believed that they are immune to BA2 after their recent omicron wave. They are wrong -- there is some sobering news for those leaders who claim 'COVID is over' -- they are delusional as cases are soaring across Europe again, this time dominated mostly by BA2 plus with added relaxation of mitigations. Let's always learn from what's happening elsewhere, because #CovidIsNotOver.

As you can see [from a map available at the source URL], cases are rising everywhere in China. It's not just in northeast Jilin or south near Shenzhen. So far, 23 of the 31 mainland provinces reported confirmed, symptomatic cases over the past week. Including asymptomatic cases, there were almost 10 000 new cases. Worse, more than half of mainland China's age 80+ population is not fully vaccinated with at least 2 shots. This could spell tremendous doom if COVID spreads like wildfire, given the overwhelmingly higher risk of death in the elderly.

I'm now confident that BA2 definitely deserves its own distinct Greek letter, separate from the omicron family. BA1 and BA2 are more different from each other than delta is from the original Wuhan 1.0 strain. And the infectiousness and attack rates don't lie -- BA2 is worse by leaps and bounds. The WHO needs to act to reclassify BA2 as a new distinct variant of concern. And China needs to act even faster to increase vaccinations as well as mitigations, and the rest of the world needs to wake up that they are not immune from BA2 despite a recent BA1 wave.

Bottomline
----------
I believe China is now teetering at the edge between barely containing the BA2 wave of COVID-19 and completely losing control like it has in Hong Kong -- which we know could spell horrible condition outcomes and huge economic difficulties and disruption to the most critical manufacturing and export centers of the world. Thus, this bodes extremely poorly for the rest of the global supply chain crisis and economic stability. And it could even spill over into the Russian-Ukraine driven inflation crisis. What happens in China over the coming weeks will affect the world. COVID is not over -- with the world acting slowly only further endangering the world.

While we will cover how China got here, I want to first explore where this is going based on what we know about the predominant BA2 variant and how bad this could get:
• As China is reinstating measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus in several cities amid a spike in infections, China is desperately trying to avoid the fate of Hong Kong -- HK deaths are surging so high they are approaching NYC in spring 2020.
• Furthermore, experts say HK's deaths have not even peaked yet. Moreover, cases may not come down for quite a while to low levels until May [2022] or even June [2022].
• All while HK is running out of morgue space and hospitals continue to be overrun. Hong Kong was once as strict on COVID-19 as mainland China was.
• Yet somehow it partly gave up and lost control. Compared to 44 other high income countries -- HK's mortality rate is now highest in the world.
• If HK is a country, its COVID-19 death rate per capita would be 5x higher than the next highest country.
• If this hits Shanghai and other major Chinese industrial cities, supply chains worldwide will suffer.

Mainland China has already begun to divert flights away from Shanghai and began partial lockdown this week, with schools either closing or going to remote learning. Moreover, shipping vessels have even stopped departing from Shanghai as a port! This is damn serious -- Shanghai is one of the largest ports in the entire world! Along with the lockdown in Shenzhen and adjacent Dongguan, China's disruption could mean that the world's supply chain might completely melt down for a period. Already, Apple supplier FoxConn has announced it is suspending all its factories in Shenzhen, among countless other critical technical and industrial factories. While temporary suspensions and brief lockdowns have occurred before, the potential scale of this BA2 wave is massive, and like HK experts warn, could be very long and extensive.

Covid-19 (40) - China: resurgence, increase in cases despite confinement measures
https://elcomercio.pe/mundo/asia/omicron-coronavirus-china-registra-mas-de-5000-nuevos-casos-de-covid-19-un-record-desde-hace-dos-anos-noticia/
English: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/15/china-covid-cases-more-than-double-in-growing-outbreak

China has reported more than 5000 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, more than double the number reported on Monday [14 Mar 2022] and the highest daily count since the pandemic began more than 2 years ago.

The northeastern province of Jilin, the worst-hit area, accounted for more than 3000 cases, the National Health Commission said.

No new deaths have been reported, but cases have been reported in more than a dozen provinces and major cities including Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen.

[Ref: Syed Hassan Ahmed, Summaiyya Waseem, Taha Gul Shaikh. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated-tinnitus: a review. Annals of Medicine and Surgery Volume 75, March 2022, 103293. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2022.103293]

Highlights
• The COVID-19 global vaccination program has significantly reduced hospitalization and deaths due to infection.
• According to VAERS, 12 247 cases of coronavirus post-vaccination tinnitus have been reported
till 14 Sep 2021.
• This review highlights the potential mechanism, diagnosis and management of COVID-19
vaccine-associated tinnitus.
• Corticosteroids were the first-line treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-associated
tinnitus.

Abstract
--------
The global vaccination drive against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is being pursued at a historic pace. Unexpected adverse effects have been reported following vaccination, including thrombotic thrombocytopenia and myocarditis, amongst others. More recently, some cases of tinnitus are reported post-vaccination. According to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), 12 247 cases of coronavirus post-vaccination tinnitus have been reported till 14 Sep 2021. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review evaluating any otologic manifestation following vaccine administration and aims to evaluate the potential pathophysiology, clinical approach, and treatment. Although the incidence is infrequent, there is a need to understand the precise mechanisms and treatment for vaccine-associated-tinnitus.

[Data by country, area, or territory for 16 Mar 2022 can be accessed at https://bit.ly/3Jyqbbu.

- The Americas region reported 6.7% of cases and 12.0% of deaths (USA reported an adjustment of -2094 with 412 new deaths in the past 24 hours) during the past 24 hours having reported more than 149.18 million cases, second to the European region as the most severely affected region. The USA reported 71 241 cases followed by Brazil and Chile. An additional 4 countries reported more than 1000 cases (Argentina, Canada, Martinique and Uruguay) in the past 24 hours. Additionally, Cuba reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases. Mexico, Bolivia and Ecuador, among others, did not report any cases in the last 24 hours.

- The European region reported 49.1% of cases and 64.1% of deaths over the last 24 hours, as the most affected region, with cumulative cases exceeding 189.96 million. Some countries reporting few or no cases in the last 24 hours or longer include Belgium (12 cases), Portugal, and Tajikistan, among others. A total of 36 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours, 2 countries reported more than 100 000 cases, 11 reported more than 10 000, 19 reported over 1000 cases, and 4 countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 0.45% of daily case numbers and 4.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 21.46 million cases. Iran (3223) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by Bahrain. Iraq and Lebanon reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases over the last 24 hours. Jordan, Egypt, and Sudan, among others, did not report any cases over the last 24 hours.

- The African region reported 0.17% of daily cases and 0.29% of total deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.50 million cases. South Africa (1648), reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by Zimbabwe and Benin. Most of the remaining countries reported below 100 or 50 cases. A total of 20 countries did not report any cases over the last 24 hours. The low reported numbers may not be a true reflection of the prevalent COVID-19 situation in the region as vaccine coverage remains low.

- The Western Pacific region reported 41.1% of daily case numbers and 19.7% of deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 34.57 million cases. South Korea (362 338), reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by Vietnam, Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, China, and Brunei. Japan and Philippines, among others, did not report any cases over the last 24 hours.

- The South East Asia region reported 2.4% of the daily newly reported cases and 11.5% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 56.58 million cases. Thailand (23 945) reported the highest number of cases followed by India (2876), Bhutan (681), and Nepal (61). The remaining countries did not report any cases over the last 24 hours.
