Boar meat kills man
-------------------
A man died and his wife remained in an intensive-care unit yesterday after
they ate undercooked boar meat earlier this month [May 2005]. A 43-year-old
man died while receiving treatment at a local hospital and his 27-year-old
wife is in a respirator. 2 neighbours who shared the food were also
hospitalised, but their conditions were not serious. Dr Pongthep Pirawit,
who treated the 4 patients, said they all suffered trichinosis [also called
trichinellosis. - Mod.JW], brought on by the undercooked boar meat.
Trichinosis is infestation of trichina larvae, which are transmitted by
eating inadequately cooked meat, especially pork. Larvae migrate from the
victim's intestinal tract to the muscles, where they become cysts.
Dr Pongthep warned people to eat only well-cooked food, saying that
trichinosis could be fatal, as in this case. The patient and other local
residents hunted and killed a boar on 13 May 2005. They then shared the
meat, some of which was only partly cooked. "3 days later, we had difficulty
breathing, felt dizzy and vomited all the time. [They] were rushed to a
hospital," he said.
