Sigatoka attacks Pomeroon farmers
---------------------------------
Farmers living in the Lower Pomeroon area are complaining of being
severely affected by the black and yellow sigatoka on both the
plantain and banana crops.

The disease is said to resist known pesticides. A farmer said, "All
of the farmers are affected by this disease." He said that other
farmers have lost huge acreages of their crop and are extremely
frustrated.

Another farmer has lost 20 acres [8 ha] of both plantains and bananas
to the yellow sigatoka, which is the most prevalent. He said that he
and other farmers in the Lower Pomeroom area have been affected since
last year [2010]. "All of my plantain and banana plants have been
destroyed."

A team from the National Agricultural Research Institute visited
earlier in January [2011] and distributed pesticides. The team even
sprayed the damaged crop, but the problem remains. The pesticides were
not effective and the agricultural officers have not revisited.

The disease is also prevalent in the North West District and Supenaam
area.

[Black sigatoka (BS), also known as black leaf streak, is caused by
the fungus _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_, which affects only species and
hybrids of _Musa_. Worldwide, BS is one of the most devastating leaf
diseases of bananas and seriously affects plant vigour.

The related species _M. musicola_ causes yellow sigatoka (YS). YS
occurs in most banana growing areas and was first reported from Java
in 1902, long before BS appeared in Fiji in 1963. In areas where both
sigatoka pathogens are present, it is often difficult to distinguish
between them under field conditions and laboratory analysis may be
needed for a clear diagnosis.

Symptoms and epidemiology are similar for YS and BS. YS symptoms
appear mainly on older leaves and, therefore, less damage is caused to
photosynthetic tissue than by BS. There are more cultivars of banana
and plantain with degrees of resistance to YS than to BS. YS is more
adapted to cooler temperatures and is often dominant at higher
altitudes. The pathogens are spread by water, wind, and with plant
material, including suckers, and can cause yield losses of up to 50
percent. Fruit produced on diseased plants can ripen prematurely
during commercial shipment causing further losses. Disease management
includes frequent applications of fungicides, phytosanitary measures,
and cultural practices.

Both YS and BS have been causing serious crop losses in the Caribbean
and continue to spread there mainly by windborne spores. In 2009, a
new disease of banana was reported in Guyana, which was subsequently
diagnosed as YS and/or BS (see ProMED-mail posts listed below). The
claim in the report above that the disease is resistant to known
pesticides may indicate the possible emergence of a new pathogen
strain.
