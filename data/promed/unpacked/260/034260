Summary
------
What is already known about the topic?
Community and close contact exposures contribute to the spread of COVID-19.

What is added by this report?
Findings from a case-control investigation of symptomatic outpatients from 11 US health care facilities found that close contact with persons with known COVID-19 or going to locations that offer on-site eating and drinking options were associated with COVID-19 positivity. Adults with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results were approximately twice as likely to have reported dining at a restaurant than were those with negative SARS-CoV-2 test results.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Eating and drinking on-site at locations that offer such options might be important risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Efforts to reduce possible exposures where mask use and social distancing are difficult to maintain, such as when eating and drinking, should be considered to protect customers, employees, and communities.

---
To assess community and close contact exposures associated with COVID-19, exposures reported by case-patients (154) were compared with exposures reported by control-participants (160). Case-patients were symptomatic adults (persons aged 18 years and older) with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Control-participants were symptomatic outpatient adults from the same health care facilities who had negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. Close contact with a person with known COVID-19 was more commonly reported among case-patients (42%) than among control-participants (14%). Case-patients were more likely to have reported dining at a restaurant (any area designated by the restaurant, including indoor, patio, and outdoor seating) in the 2 weeks preceding illness onset than were control-participants (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5-3.8). Restricting the analysis to participants without known close contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19, case-patients were more likely to report dining at a restaurant (aOR = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.9-4.3) or going to a bar/coffee shop (aOR = 3.9; 95% CI = 1.5-10.1) than were control-participants. Exposures and activities where mask use and social distancing are difficult to maintain, including going to places that offer on-site eating or drinking, might be important risk factors for acquiring COVID-19. As communities reopen, efforts to reduce possible exposures at locations that offer on-site eating and drinking options should be considered to protect customers, employees, and communities.

Approximately one-half of all participants reported shopping and visiting others inside a home (in groups of 10 or fewer persons) on 1 or more day during the 14 days preceding symptom onset. No significant differences were observed in the bivariate analysis between case-patients and control-participants in shopping; gatherings with 10 or fewer persons in a home; going to an office setting; going to a salon; gatherings with more than 10 persons in a home; going to a gym; using public transportation; going to a bar/coffee shop; or attending church/religious gathering. However, case-patients were more likely to have reported dining at a restaurant (aOR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.5-3.8) in the 2 weeks before illness onset than were control-participants (see Figure at source URL). Further, when the analysis was restricted to the 225 participants who did not report recent close contact with a person with known COVID-19, case-patients were more likely than were control-participants to have reported dining at a restaurant (aOR = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.9-4.3) or going to a bar/coffee shop (aOR = 3.9; 95% CI = 1.5-10.1). Among 107 participants who reported dining at a restaurant and 21 participants who reported going to a bar/coffee shop, case-patients were less likely to report observing almost all patrons at the restaurant adhering to recommendations such as wearing a mask or social distancing (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively)

Reports of exposures in restaurants have been linked to air circulation (7; see source URL for reference). Direction, ventilation, and intensity of airflow might affect virus transmission, even if social distancing measures and mask use are implemented according to current guidance. Masks cannot be effectively worn while eating and drinking, whereas shopping and numerous other indoor activities do not preclude mask use.

[While the authors discuss limitations of the study that may have influenced these results, when one walks by many of the outdoor eating and drinking establishments, one observes the majority of individuals removing their masks before being served and many speaking loudly, which helps further the spread of possible virus load if the speaker is asymptomatic or presymptomatic. The data are clearly there to support the need for mask use and social distancing. These are serious challenges to slowing down transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. - Mod.MPP]

Abstract
--------
Objective: To determine the rates of asymptomatic viral carriage and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in healthcare workers.

Design: A cross-sectional study of asymptomatic healthcare workers undertaken on 24/25 Apr 2020.

Setting: University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT), UK.

Participants: 545 asymptomatic healthcare workers were recruited while at work. Participants were invited to participate via the UHBFT social media. Exclusion criteria included current symptoms consistent with COVID-19. No potential participants were excluded.

Intervention: Participants volunteered a nasopharyngeal swab and a venous blood sample that were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies, respectively. Results were interpreted in the context of prior illnesses and the hospital departments in which participants worked.

Main outcome measure: Proportion of participants demonstrating infection and positive SARS-CoV-2 serology.

Results: The point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 viral carriage was 2.4% (n = 13/545). The overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 24.4% (n = 126/516). Participants who reported prior symptomatic illness had higher seroprevalence (37.5% vs 17.1%, chi-squared = 21.1034, p less than 0.0001) and quantitatively greater antibody responses than those who had remained asymptomatic. Seroprevalence was greatest among those working in housekeeping (34.5%), acute medicine (33.3%) and general internal medicine (30.3%), with lower rates observed in participants working in intensive care (14.8%). BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) ethnicity was associated with a significantly increased risk of seropositivity (OR: 1.92, 95% CI 1.14-3.23, p = 0.01). Working on the intensive care unit was associated with a significantly lower risk of seropositivity compared with working in other areas of the hospital (OR: 0.28, 95% CI 0.09-0.78, p = 0.02).

Conclusions and relevance: We identify differences in the occupational risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 between hospital departments and confirm asymptomatic seroconversion occurs in healthcare workers. Further investigation of these observations is required to inform future infection control and occupational health practices.

[Healthcare workers are always at high risk of exposure for pathogens in hospital and clinic settings. This is especially true early in outbreaks before it is clear what is happening, but even well into the outbreak when respiratory pathogens are involved. It was found in this study that there was a differential risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure within the hospital environment, with intensive care unit infection being lower than housekeeping, acute medicine, and general internal medicine. "The reasons underlying this are likely to be multifactorial: in accordance with national guidelines, intensive care units were designated high-risk environments and the use of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) including filtered face piece (class 3) respirators mandated. In contrast, fluid-resistant surgical masks were recommended in other clinical areas. The contribution of enhanced PPE in protecting staff from infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be studied further, including the availability of training, space and supervision to use PPE effectively. Differential occupational exposure to severe respiratory viruses was previously observed during the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak."

The study also found ethnic disparities in the Black, Asian and minority ethnic healthcare workers. It could not be determined whether "increased risk of seropositivity arises from a greater risk of exposure to the virus, or a greater risk of infection if exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus." This is important to study further because of the poorer outcome following infection of these same groups.

As has been demonstrated in other studies, "antibody responses were, on average, significantly greater in individuals with prior symptomatic illness compared with those who remained asymptomatic. Further studies must determine the neutralising capacity of antibody responses associated with different severities of disease, the titres at which neutralising antibodies provide protection against infection and the duration of that protection." These last points are extremely important in evaluating vaccine efficacy.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory for 11 Sep 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesSept11%20(1)_1599871018.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 38.2% of daily case numbers and 60.2% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 14.4 million cases. Brazil and the USA remain dominant, followed by Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Mexico.

- The European region reported 16.8% of daily case numbers and 7.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 4.7 million. Countries not reporting to WHO today (11 Sep 2020) include Israel and Belgium. The dominant country is Spain, followed by France, Russia, Ukraine, the UK, Turkey, Germany, Kazakhstan, Romania, Italy and the Czech Republic.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.4% of daily case numbers and 5.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2 million cases. Iraq remains the dominant country, followed by Iran, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon.

- The African region reported 1.8% of daily case numbers and 2.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.1 million cases. South Africa is again the dominant country, followed by Ethiopia, Ghana, Algeria, Nigeria, Uganda, and Cameroon.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.7% of daily case numbers and 1.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.53 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 36.0% of the daily newly reported cases and 22.5% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 5.1 million cases. India continues to dominate followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Nepal.

Europe, while experiencing resurgences in many countries related to loosening restrictions and the summer vacation period, is overshadowed by the major transmission ongoing in South East Asia, specifically India, with record-breaking daily case reports.

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India now in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (97 654), followed by the USA (48 084) and Brazil (44 215) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.4%) and 58.1% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 6722 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (10-11 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Spain (22 554), Argentina (11 507), France (9406), Colombia (7424), Mexico (5935), and Russia (5504), and 31 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. Five of the top 10 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the Americas region. Spain reported the 4th highest daily cases globally, breaking all its prior records.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 15.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 27.4%.

Impression: Cases are increasing globally, with Europe showing major increasing transmission. - Mod.MPP]
