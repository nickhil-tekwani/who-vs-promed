South Africa's national lottery is claiming an unlikely victim:
vultures. Local people, convinced these birds' superb eyesight gives
them the gift to see the future, are eating vulture meat to acquire
the power of clairvoyance. And they are not alone. In neighbouring
Zimbabwe, voters fearful of supporting the losing side in recent
elections ate vulture meat, mainly heads, talons, eyes and hearts,
believing this would enable them to pick the winning party. Then
there has been the rise of traditional medicines, for which vulture
parts are highly valued, as well as soaring cases of poisoning and
shooting [them] by starving farmers in East and West Africa.
In addition, in south Asia over the past 5 years, the use of the
painkiller diclofenac in cattle has wiped out 3 species of vulture
and reduced the remaining 2 species to a few dozen pairs of breeding
birds. The drug, it was discovered recently, destroys the birds' kidneys.
In short, the vulture -- the ultimate scavenger, forever associated
with pitiless opportunism -- has been sent spiralling towards
extinction, say ornithologists. "There has been an almost total
collapse in numbers in many parts of the world," said Guy Rondeau, of
Afrique Nature International.
The consequence of this dramatic decline is not merely an issue that
should concern wildlife enthusiasts. Vultures' ability to pinpoint
[dead animals] as they circle hundreds of feet in the air, combined
with their power to strip carcasses clean of their flesh in minutes,
mean they are vital in limiting the spread of diseases in livestock.
This problem has reached the level of a major ecological issue in
Asia, as ornithologist Mark Anderson, based in South Africa, points
out. "In India the cow is sacred and cannot be eaten. So it was
traditionally left to vultures to eat their corpses. Without
vultures, packs of feral dogs have taken over." "These packs are
'destroying livestock and wildlife, harassing people and sometimes
spreading rabies and other diseases," added Chris Bowden, a vulture
expert with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
In addition, the Parsees of India, who leave their dead on 'towers of
silence' to be picked clean by vultures, have had to develop
alternatives. In Mumbai, one group bought 6 'solar concentrators' --
mirrors -- to cremate corpses using sun power. In many countries
vultures are venerated. The ancient Egyptians worshipped the vulture,
while shamans in hunter-gatherer tribes attributed the powers of
clairvoyance to them. Many countries, including Mali, have vultures
as their national emblem, although the bird has all but disappeared
from its skies.
"Vultures have completely deserted the colonies on the cliffs around
our village," said Diomande, a hunter from the Bafing region of
southwest Mali. "We don't see any today. We think they are angry at
the way we treat the land."
A measure of this loss is provided by recent surveys which indicate
that vulture numbers have dropped by 95 per cent in West Africa. "It
also appears there has been a similar, drastic reduction in East
Africa," added Anderson.
The exact causes of the disappearance of the vulture in Africa are
unclear. In Asia, diclofenac was responsible, but that is not the
case in Africa -- it is hardly used there. There seems to be a number
of causes. The need for vulture flesh to satisfy markets for
traditional medicines, their links with clairvoyance, hunting, and
deliberate poisoning are probably all involved. The result has been
plummeting numbers of a species that may look unpleasant but which
has some heart-warming qualities: vultures mate for life while
mothers and fathers share nest duties.
There is one encouraging piece of news. Vultures have started to
prosper in Europe. Conservation programmes in Spain and France have
been so successful that wild vultures have been spotted even in the
Netherlands and Scandinavia. The vulture may be dying out in Asia and
Africa, but it could soon appear in Britain, it seems.
