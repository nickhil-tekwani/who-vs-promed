The Colorado Department of Agriculture [CDA] has confirmed more cases of vesicular stomatitis (VSV) in La Plata, Larimer, and Weld counties. The Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Fort Collins has been activated through the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) to receive and test samples for VSV suspect horses.

The total count of premises under quarantine for VSV by county is 2 in La Plata County, 5 in Larimer County, and 8 in Weld County. None of the animals in quarantine have yet been released. CDA's Animal Health division is updating this information with the latest data on its CDA VSV website: <colorado.gov/aganimals/vesicular-stomatitis-virus-vsv>.

"Horse and livestock owners should check with their veterinarian prior to traveling to another state," said Colorado state veterinarian Dr Keith Roehr. "Many states have imposed import requirements for animals coming from VSV-affected states."

The 1st case of VSV in Colorado was reported on 3 Jul 2019 in Weld County by a field veterinarian from the State Veterinarian's Office at the Colorado Department of Agriculture. An incursion of VSV-infected insect vectors is the likely source of infection. There are no USDA-approved vaccines for VSV.

Vesicular stomatitis background
-------------------------------
Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle and occasionally swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and alpacas. The transmission process of VSV is not completely understood but includes insect vectors such as black flies, sand flies, and biting midges.

The incubation period ranges from 2-8 days. Clinical signs include vesicles, erosions, and sloughing of the skin on the muzzle, tongue, ears, teats, and coronary bands. Often excessive salivation is the 1st sign of disease, along with a reluctance to eat or drink. Lameness and weight loss may follow.

Humans may become infected when handling affected animals, but this is a rare event. To avoid human exposure, individuals should use personal protective measures when handling affected animals.

Tips for livestock owners
-------------------------
- Strict fly control is an important factor to inhibit the transmission of the disease.
- Avoid transferring feeding equipment, cleaning tools, or healthcare equipment from other herds.
- Colorado veterinarians and livestock owners should contact the state of destination when moving livestock interstate to ensure that all import requirements are met. Contact information for all state veterinarian offices is listed here.
- Colorado fairs, livestock exhibitions, and rodeos may institute new entry requirements based on the extent and severity of the current VS outbreak. Certificates of veterinary inspection (CVIs or health certificates) issued 2-5 days prior to an event can be beneficial in reducing risks. Be sure to stay informed of any new livestock event requirements.

Any vesicular disease of livestock is reportable to the State Veterinarian's Office in Colorado.

Vesicular stomatitis (VSV) in Texas situational update

Since the 1st case of VSV was confirmed in equine on a Kinney County premises, the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) has received reports of 8 new confirmed cases of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).

Texas VSV confirmations since 24 Jun 2019:
- 3 new VSV-infected equine premises have been confirmed in Coleman County
- 1 new VSV-infected equine premises has been confirmed in Kerr County
- 1 new VSV-infected equine premises has been confirmed in Taylor County
- 2 new VSV-infected equine premises have been confirmed in Tom Green County
- 1 new VSV-infected equine premises has been confirmed in Val Verde County.

The newly confirmed premises are under quarantine by the TAHC. Affected horses will be monitored by regulatory and authorized veterinarians until premises are eligible for quarantine release 14 days after clinical VSV signs are observed.

To date, 10 premises in 6 Texas counties have been confirmed with VSV. Currently affected counties include Coleman, Kerr, Kinney, Taylor, Tom Green, and Val Verde counties. Of the 10 premises, one has been released.

TAHC will send out VSV updates every Friday, and all cases will be reported to the Equine Disease Communication Center.

What veterinarians need to know:
- Several states are imposing enhanced entry requirements on Texas livestock due to the VSV cases. For information, contact the state of destination. For a list of state animal health offices visit https://www.usaha.org/upload/Federal%20and%20State%20Health/STATE_ANIMAL_HEALTH_OFFICIALS%20-%20Copy%201.pdf.
- If you suspect your client's horse has VSV, contact your TAHC region office at <www.tahc.texas.gov/agency/contact.html> for paperwork and procedures.

What equine and cattle owners need to know:
- VSV is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle.
- In the past decade, the southwestern and western United States have experienced a number of VSV outbreaks. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways.
- VSV normally has an incubation period of 2-8 days before the infected animal develops blisters that swell and burst, leaving painful sores. The virus can be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or by blood-feeding insects.
- If VSV is confirmed, infected animals are quarantined for 14 days after clinical signs of lesions are observed. This short-term quarantine helps prevent the movement of animals and the spread of the disease to other premises, fairs, or markets.

Strategies for preventing VSV:
Even with the best defensive measures, VSV could infect a herd. However, these tips may help protect livestock:
1. Control biting flies.
2. Keep equine animals stalled or under a roof at night to reduce exposure to flies.
3. Keep stalls clean.
4. Feed and water stock from their individual buckets.
5. Don't visit a ranch that's under quarantine for VSV. Wait until the animals have healed.

["Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease caused by 2 distinct serotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus: New Jersey and Indiana. Vesiculation, ulceration, and erosion of the oral and nasal mucosa and epithelial surface of the tongue, coronary bands, and teats are typically seen in clinical cases, along with crusting lesions of the muzzle, ventral abdomen, and sheath. Clinical disease has been seen in cattle, horses, and pigs and very rarely in sheep, goats, and llamas. Serologic evidence of exposure has been found in many species, including cervids, nonhuman primates, rodents, birds, dogs, antelope, and bats.

"Vesicular stomatitis is seen sporadically in the USA. Outbreaks historically occurred in all regions of the country but since the 1980s have been limited to western states and occur seasonally, usually May through October. Outbreaks occurred in the USA in 1995, 1997, 1998, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, and 2012. The largest outbreak in the past decade occurred in 2005 and affected 9 states.

"Vesicular stomatitis viruses are endemic in South America, Central America, and parts of Mexico but have not been seen naturally outside the Western hemisphere. The virus can be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals with clinical disease (those with lesions) or by blood-feeding insects. In the southwestern USA, black flies (Simuliidae) are the most likely biologic insect vector. In endemic areas, sand flies (_Lutzomyia_) are proven biologic vectors. Other insects may act as mechanical vectors.

"Exposure to insects that carry the virus is often associated with nearby moving water sources such as creeks or rivers or irrigation of pastures. Experimental studies have shown that feeding of infected insects on mucosal surfaces and non-haired areas of the body were more often associated with development of lesions at those sites than if insects fed on haired areas of the body. The prevalence of clinical cases in a herd is generally low (10-20%), but seroprevalence within the herd may approach 100%. Viremia has not been detected in livestock species that exhibit clinical signs of vesicular stomatitis, although experimental studies have shown transmission of virus, presumably via lymphatics, between co-feeding black flies on cattle.

"Virus is routinely isolated from active lesions in affected animals, and these lesions serve as a source of virus spread by direct contact and contamination of shared feed and water stations. Many vertebrate species have serologic evidence of exposure and may serve as reservoirs of infection. No definitive reservoir or amplifying host of vesicular stomatitis viruses in the USA has been identified.

"No specific treatment is available or warranted. Cachexia [physical wasting and malnutrition usually associated with chronic disease] can be avoided by providing softened feeds. Cleansing lesions with mild antiseptics may help avoid secondary bacterial infections. Management factors suggested to reduce risk of exposure to the virus include limiting time on pasture during insect season, providing shelters or barns during insect-feeding times, and implementing other procedures that reduce animal contact with insects, such as application of insecticides. This should include application to the inner surface of the pinna, where black flies feed. If livestock need to be kept on pasture during outbreaks of vesicular stomatitis, then keeping them pastured away from moving surface water (such as streams, irrigation canals, or rivers) may reduce the risk of exposure to _Vesiculovirus_. Affected animals should be isolated, and movement of other animals from the affected premises restricted. Vesicular stomatitis is a reportable disease in most areas, including the USA, so state and federal animal health officials must be notified when it is suspected. Commercially produced vaccines are not available in the USA, but vaccines for livestock are available in some Latin American countries" (https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/vesicular-stomatitis/overview-of-vesicular-stomatitis).

Use appropriate fly and mosquito sprays intended for horses to help your animal avoid these biting insects.

As a reminder, if you are traveling, consult your veterinarian, who may contact the state of destination to see whether their import requirements have changed due to VSV now being found in the United States. Many states are requiring additional statements being added to the export certificate of veterinary inspection (CVI or ICVI), and some states are requiring permit numbers. - Mod.TG]
