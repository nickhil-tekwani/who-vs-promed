The OIE (Office International de Epizooties) Representation for Asia and
the Pacific office in Tokyo published Regional Epidemiology Yearbook in
1995 by country/territory and by disease.
The Yearbook already posted in 1992, 1993 and 1994.
The OIE Representation for Asia and the Pacific office was established
in Tokyo in February 1992 and new activities started in Asia and the
Pacific under the OIE/Japan Trust Fund Programme. One of the activities
is to gather animal disease information covering 10 List A diseases and
26 List B diseases. Information gathered from member countries of
OIE and territories in the region are published in the following two
publications:
a) OIE Quarterly Epidemiology Report
b) OIE Regional Epidemiology Yearbook.
These publications issued on a quarterly or an annual basis are distributed
to the countries and territories in this region only, and so far data are not
included in monthly or annual reports issued by OIE Headquarters.
Please feel free to contact me for any further information through
the E-mail (chujo@niah.affrc.go.jp).
