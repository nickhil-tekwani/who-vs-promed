Bangladesh: Nipah Virus Outbreaks from Jan to Apr 2004
----------------------------------------------
On 17 Jan 2004, a 9-year-old child from Kazipara village was brought to the
emergency room of Goalanda health complex in Rajbari district, Bangladesh.
The patient had a 3-day history of fever and worsening neurological signs.
He died within 15 minutes of admission. Between 17 and 21 Jan 2004, 6
additional children (aged between 2 and 15 years) and a 28-year-old woman
(mother of the youngest child) also died with the same symptoms. All
patients came from the neighboring Kazipara and Juran Molla Para villages
and lived in 2 groups of houses located within 1 km of each other. On 21
Jan 2004, Goalanda health authorities triggered the alert and sent a report
to the central level. On 22 Jan 2004, a joint investigation mission with
the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of the
Ministry of Health, the Centre for Health and Population Research (ICDDRB),
and the WHO country office was dispatched to Goalanda to verify the rumors
and to collect samples for laboratory diagnosis.
Between 22 and 27 Jan 2004, the investigation team was able to confirm the
outbreak and to provide a 1st description of the epidemic. Blood samples
obtained from several patients were sent to the Special Pathogen Branch
(SPB) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta,
USA. On 4 Feb 2004, SPB-CDC detected IgM antibodies against Nipah virus in
the serum of 5 patients. The laboratory investigations included ELISA tests
for IgG and IgM antibodies, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
to detect the viral genome, and viral isolation. CDC was able to culture
the virus from 2 of the patients. Viral RNA was amplified to show that a
Nipah virus -- with about a 95 percent homology with that isolated during
the Malaysian outbreak in 1999 -- was the cause of the outbreak.
Surveillance
------------
In light of the findings of previous epidemic investigations and of the
clinical presentation of the first 8 confirmed Bangladeshi cases, 3
categories were employed for case definition: (1) suspect, (2) probable,
and (3) laboratory-confirmed. In addition, when samples were collected from
probable and suspect cases, they were reclassified as "non-cases" if they
were negative for Nipah virus IgM antibodies. Routine epidemiological
surveillance was reinforced by an active suspect-encephalitis
case-notification system -- implemented in Faridpur, Manikgonj, and Rajbari
districts -- surrounding the outbreak epicenter. Surveillance was also
reinforced by IEDCR across the entire territory.
Epidemiology
------------
Descriptive epidemiology was undertaken based on the case definition. A
case of Nipah virus infection was any probable or laboratory-confirmed
case. As at 23 Feb 2004, 23 Nipah cases -- including 11
laboratory-confirmed cases -- had been identified in 6 districts (Faridpur,
Golpagonj, Manikgonj, Joypurat, Naogaon, Rajbari). 17 of the 23 cases died
(case-fatality rate of 74 percent). In all the affected districts, cases
were clustered geographically and in time. The 1st identified case
developed the 1st symptoms of the disease on 11 Jan 2004. Most of the
detected cases occurred between 12 and 25 Jan 2004 (for 20 out of 23 cases)
suggesting a common source of contamination. [Figure 1 (not shown here)
illustrates the weekly distribution of cases (survivors and deaths) of
Nipah virus infection in 6 districts of Bangladesh as of 23 Feb 2004. -

The main focus, with 12 Nipah cases, was identified in Goalanda, Rajbari
district, where an in-depth investigation was undertaken. Of the 12 cases,
9 were male (75 percent) and aged under 19 years. The investigation failed
to establish any link between these cases and sick pigs -- or other types
of sick mammals -- as was observed during the Malaysian Nipah outbreak.
Conversely, it was noted in Goalanda that young boys collected and ate
fruits in the trees before dawn. This observation gave rise to the
hypothesis that contamination could have occurred while eating the same
fruits that fruit bats (_Pteropodidae_) fed on during the night.
Several epidemiological studies were conducted by the investigation team in
Goalanda. These included a case-control study to identify risk factors for
infection, a seroprevalence study to assess the spread of the infection
(antibody detection) in the general population, and a follow-up of
convalescent cases to assess antibody kinetics and duration of viral
shedding. Fieldwork has been completed, and data analysis has begun.
Clinical description
---------------------
Most of the identified cases were transferred to the Dhaka Medical College
Hospital and the Dhaka Shishu Hospital where definitive case management was
organized. Among 11 patients with laboratory-confirmed Nipah virus
infection, the most commonly reported signs and symptoms included fever
(11/11), headache (4/11), vomiting (5/11), dizziness (5/11), altered
consciousness or total or partial loss of consciousness (11/11), coma
(9/11), focal neurological signs (3/11), disorientation/hallucination
(4/11), seizure (8/11), respiratory distress (6/11) and cough/cold (3/11).
Ecological studies
------------------
Ecological studies were conducted to establish the source of human
infection and identify the natural reservoir of Nipah virus in Bangladesh.
The team focused its work in the Goalanda area and sampled domestic,
peridomestic and wild animals living in or around the affected villages. It
prioritized taxa associated with previous Nipah virus outbreaks in Malaysia
(i.e. Megachiropteran bats and pigs). Laboratory investigations are
currently under way at SPB-CDC, although preliminary results confirm that
several _Pteropus_ flying foxes have evidence of Nipah virus infection.
Social mobilization and health education
------------------
The Ministry of Health and the WHO team relayed all relevant information to
the press on a regular basis thereby keeping the public regularly informed
about the evolution of the situation and of investigations. Given the
results of the epidemiological investigation, it was proposed that several
health education messages be prepared to improve hygiene while eating
fruits (washing, peeling, cooking fruits before eating them, and
hand-washing at home) in order to break the primary infection and
transmission of the disease. The support of medical anthropologists and
experts in social mobilization will be needed to prepare these messages.
Cluster of Nipah Cases in Faridpur District, Mar - Apr 2004
-----------------
On 19 Apr 2004, the Bangladesh Ministry of Health reported one cluster of
30 Nipah cases, including 18 deaths from 13 Mar to 14 Apr in Faridpur
district. Laboratory testing, performed by CDC, confirmed Nipah virus
infection in 16 of the cases.
The outbreak was investigated by a team comprising experts from the IEDCR,
ICDDRB and the WHO country office. All cases lived in Guha Laksmipur
village or were in contact with a spiritual leader living in this village
who was himself a case. Direct contact with ill patients is suspected to
have played a role in the transmission of the disease and the spread of
this outbreak.
The team organized infection-control and safe clinical-management workshops
for local medical staff in different health care settings of the Faridpur
district. Investigations are continuing.
Conclusion
----------
After Meherpur (2001) and Naogaon (2003), Bangladesh faces again an
epidemic of Nipah. As in 2001 and 2003, few cases were identified, but this
time suspect cases are more widely spread throughout the country. Until
studies have been completed, and control and prevention measures discussed,
the investigation team has proposed the following short-term recommendations:
1. Creation of a task force for Nipah outbreaks using a multidisciplinary
approach.
2. Creation of special funds for outbreak response and to support families
and hospitals.
3. Institution of urgent measures to prevent nosocomial infection in all
hospitals of the country (patient isolation, injection safety, safe waste
disposal, etc.).
4. Preparation of prevention messages recommending hand-washing after
taking care of sick relatives and washing fruit, and peeling or cooking it,
before eating.
Recommendations also included medium-term activities such as strengthening
outbreak detection and investigation capacity, strengthening basic
laboratory support, transferring Nipah laboratory diagnosis capacity to
Bangladesh, and conducting further studies on the ecology of _Pteropodidae_
in Bangladesh.
An international workshop focusing on case-management, and a scientific
meeting on Nipah virus and Hendra virus, are planned to be held in Dhaka in
2004 in collaboration with experts from Australia, Malaysia, Thailand and
United States.
