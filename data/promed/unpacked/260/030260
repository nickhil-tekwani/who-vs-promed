DENVILLE, N.J.
A 32-year-old New Jersey man is close to dying of rabies after being bitten
by a bat, the first case of human rabies in the state in 25 years, doctors
said Thursday [The individual has now died. - Mod.PC.
Of 35 cases of human rabies diagnosed in the United States since 1980, 20
-- including the New Jersey man -- have been linked to bats. Less than one
percent of bats carry the rabies virus, [health official Allegra said.
New Jersey public health veterinarian Dr. Faye Sorhage said the victim, who
lives in an old house in a rural area, had handled two bats in July.
Sorhage said bat droppings in the house indicated there could have been
about 200 bats there at any one time.
The man claimed he was not bitten by the bats, but the doctors said that a
victim could be bitten without realizing it. "Their teeth are like little
pins and you might not realize you have been bitten, especially if you are
wearing gloves like this patient was at the time," Allegra said.
