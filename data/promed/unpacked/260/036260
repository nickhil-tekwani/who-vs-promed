In 2008, Russia continued to record an increasing incidence of zoonotic and
natural-focus infectious diseases. [In Russia, "natural-focus" refers to an
ecological niche in nature favoring the circulation of a disease among
wildlife. - Mod.JW]

Anthrax
-------
Incidence of anthrax [among humans] in comparison with the 1st 11
months of 2007 has increased 7.7 times: 23 cases of anthrax for the
1st 11 months of 2008, versus only 3 cases for the same period of 2007.

[The problem with Russia and anthrax is that if there are any
veterinary statistics or investigations, they are never published. We
only see the results of investigations following human infections, so
by definition it is always under-reported and probably significantly
under-observed. From the reports listed at the end of this post you
can see that that there were outbreaks in Astrakhan, Bashkortostan,
Buryatia, and Volgograd. ? Mod.MHJ]

Brucellosis
-----------
Incidence of primary brucellosis increased 46.9 per cent. From January
through November of 2008, 386 patients have been recorded, compared to
264 cases in the same period of 2007.

[According to Russia's report to the OIE for the first six months of
2008, both _Brucella abortus_ and _B. melitensis_ have been
circulating in animals (namely large and small ruminants), while _B.
suis_ was absent (but recorded during 2007). No information is yet
available for the rest of the year. It may be assumed that most
outbreaks in animals are caused by _B. melitensis_, which is rather
widespread in the Caucasus and south Russia but present also in other
regions. Though small ruminants (sheep and goats) are the main
reservoire of _B. melitensis_, the bacterium may infect other
ruminants, including cattle. ? Mod.AS]

Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome
-------------------------------------
The number of HFRS cases increased 1.7 times: for the 1st 11 months of
2008 it was 5.65 per 100 000 inhabitants, whereas for the same
period of 2007 it was 3.29 per 100 000.

[These rates would be meaningful if they were given for the population
at risk. Most of Russia is not at risk for this infection. ? Mod.JW]

Rabies
------
The number of rabies cases [among humans] increased from 5 cases for
the 1st 11 months of 2007 to 15 in 2008.

[This increase is not statistically significant. It is an
extraordinarily low number for a country with a population the size of
Russia (2007 estimate 141.4 million). Perhaps they are very
successful in applying post-bite vaccination. ? Mod.JW]

Trichinellosis
--------------
In 2008, morbidity due to trichinosis doubled: 312 cases in 2008 against
155 in 2007 for the 1st 11 months.

[There are two situations concerning trichinella: the most common
concerns consumption of undercooked wildlife, where trichinella is
widespread in carnivores like bears. This is primarily a health
education problem
and probably stable. The other problem concerns infections in domestic pigs
and wildlife meat sold as pork. This has been reported from Poland and
Latvia but not from Russia, at least not through ProMED. Our
prediction is that the trichinella situation is quite stable and the
increase in reports is due to
increased interest rather than a real increase. ? Mod.EP]
