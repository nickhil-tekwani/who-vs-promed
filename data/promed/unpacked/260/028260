During February and September 2003, the incidence and distribution of
viruses infecting grapevine (_Vitis vinifera_) in Iran was determined. 238
symptomatic and 1314 asymptomatic leaf samples were collected from 56
different vineyards from 10 Iranian provinces and tested by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the presence of Grapevine fanleaf nepovirus
(GFLV), Grapevine fleck virus (GFkV), Grapevine vitivirus A (GVA), Arabis
mosaic nepovirus (ArMV), Grapevine leafroll associated closterovirus-3
(GLRaV-3), Raspberry ringspot comovirus (RpRSV) and Tobacco ringspot
nepovirus (TRSV).
Viruses were found in almost all Iranian vineyards examined. Virus
incidence in decreasing order was: GFLV (11.1 percent), GFkV (8.6 percent),
GVA (8.4 percent), ArMV (6.6 percent), GLRaV-3 (6.4 percent), RpRSV (2.8
percent) and TRSV (0.35 percent). GFLV, either alone or in mixed infection
in 11.1 percent of the samples collected nationwide, was the most prevalent
virus. In addition, 25 (20 percent) of 125 symptomatic leaf samples from
the Orumeyeh district were infected by Tomato ringspot virus.
Viruses other than GFLV and GVA are reported from grapevine for the 1st
time in Iran

[More than 50 different viruses and viroids are known to infect grapevines
worldwide, and undoubtedly many unknown ones that have yet to be detected.
Evolution of new viruses is a constant threat to grapevine producers and
their spread by man.
The following information relates to each of the viruses in this post.
Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV):
GFLV causes a degenerative disease that is considered to be the most
serious grapevine virus disease. Affected vines are smaller than healthy
vines, and they show progressive decline. Fruit quality is poor and yield
losses range up to 80 percent. Moreover, the productive life of vineyards
are shortened and winter hardiness is decreased. GVLF is transmitted by the
nematodes _Xiphinema index_ and _X. italiae_. Natural hosts are _Vitis
vinifera_, _V. rupestris_ and many other _Vitis_ spp. and interspecific
hybrids. Symptom expression includes systemic green or yellow mosaic, ring
and line patterns and flecks, leaf and nodal malformation. GFLV is probably
distributed worldwide (in all areas where _Vitis vinifera_ and American
hybrid rootstocks are grown)
Grapevine leafroll-associated virus (GLRaV):
GLRaV is probably the most wide-spread virus disease of grapevines
world-wide. There are currently 9 different viruses associated with
leafroll, but Grapevine leafroll-associated viruses (GLRaV) 1 and 3 are
most commonly found. In the U.S. national grapevine survey conducted in
1994-1995, GLRaV-1 was present in 1.0 percent of samples tested, whereas
GLRaV-3 was present in 10.5 percent of samples tested. Since then Grapevine
leafroll-associated viruses 2, 4 and 5 have been detected in imported
grapevines. Yields of GLRaV-infected vines have reduced yields, and are
increasingly sensitivity to environmental stress. Delayed maturity of
grapes may result in a reduction of 10-70 percent in growth and yield, a
25-50 percent reduction in sugar content, and poorly coloured fruit. Long
distance spread of GLRaV depends upon movement of infected planting
material. Several mealybug and soft scale insect species have been shown to
transmit leafroll-associated viruses under experimental conditions. Rapid
leafroll spread has been reported in European vineyards having significant
insect vector populations. In California, a very low rate of natural spread
within vineyards has been observed. The common grape mealybug
(_Pseudococcus maritimus_), which occurs in the Okanagan valley of British
Columbia, is a vector of GLRaV-3.
The etiology of GLRaV disease is not well established, but several
filamentous viral particles have been associated with it, including 7
serologically unrelated closterovirus-like particles referred to as
grapevine leafroll associated viruses 1 to 7 (GLRaV 1 to 7). Grapevine
leafroll has also been associated with grapevine virus A (GVA), a
trichovirus included in the rugose wood complex. 4 mealybug species
(_Pseudococcus longispinus_, _Planococcus ficus_, _Planococcus citri_, and
_Pseudococcus affinis_are known. ) The only _Pseudococcidae_ reported to
transmit GLRaV-3 are _Planococcus ficus_ and _Pseudococcus longispinus_,
but the scale insect _Pulvinaria vitis_ may also be a vector. Several
reports on field transmission of grapevine leafroll disease have confirmed
the role of mealybugs as vectors of GVA and GLRaV- 3; although, in other
studies, no vectors were identified .
Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV):
ArMV induces leaf mottling and flecking, stunting and leaf deformation
including enations. Many infections are latent and plants are symptomless.
Symptoms vary greatly by variety, rootstock and environment conditions.
Yield losses of up to 50 percent may occur through reduced growth, dieback
and severe fruit drop. Long-distance spread occurs primarily by movement
of infected propagative material. ArMV virus is transmitted by the nematode
_Xiphinema diversicaudatum_, which is present in permanent pasture and
woodland sites in Europe and parts of the U.S., in scattered locations in
Canada, and in Australia. It also infects many other herbaceous and woody
hosts such as raspberry, strawberry, rhubarb, cherry, peach, and plums.
Raspberry ringspot virus (RpRSV):
RpRSV is transmitted by the nematodes _Longidorus elongatus_ and _L.
macrosoma_. The virus is transmitted by mechanical inoculation, by infected
seed and by pollen to the seed. RpRSV spreads in the Eurasian region and
the Mediterranean region; Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, the former
Czechoslovakia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey,
the UK, the USA, the former USSR, the former Yugoslavia. Found, but with no
evidence of spread, in Denmark. Control of this disease includes pre-plant
soil fumigation of vineyard sites to kill the dagger nematode vector. If
diseased vines are present in an established vineyard, all infected vines
will need to be identified and removed. The soil should then be tilled for
one growing season. Fumigate late-summer or autumn soil prior to replanting
with certified virus-tested clean stock. See MSU Extension Bulletin E-806
"Vineyard Preparation for Nematode and Virus Disease Control" and the
Michigan Fruit Management Guide, (Extension Bulletin E-154) for further
recommendations concerning control by soil fumigation.
Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV)
Of the many diseases caused by TRSV, bud blight of soybean is the most
severe and causes the greatest losses. Yields may be reduced by 25 to 100
percent. TRSV is the type member of the nepovirus group of plant viruses
and is related to arabis mosaic virus, grapevine fanleaf virus, tomato
black ring virus, and tomato ringspot virus. Several strains of TRSV
naturally infect soybean. TRSV is easily sap-transmissible. Nymphs of
_Thrips tabaci_ transmit it to soybean at a low level of efficiency. The
dagger nematode _Xiphinema americanum_ also is a vector, but its efficiency
in transmitting the virus to soybean is low. Nematode transmission of TRSV
to plant roots may be of no significance, because the infection generally
remains confined to the roots. Seed transmission is the most important mode
of long-range dissemination and carry-over from season to season.
Disease management involves planting a few soybean cultivars with
resistance to a some TRSV strains. One genotype (PI 407287) of the annual
ancestor of soybean (_Glycine soja_) is resistant to the virus. Other
resistant USDA plant introductions are 92713 and 154194. Virus-free
soybean seeds should be used in commercial fields, and it may be desirable
to avoid fields infested with dagger nematodes or treat them with an
appropriate nematicide, if feasible.
