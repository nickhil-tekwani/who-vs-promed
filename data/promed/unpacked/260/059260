HEAD LICE, SYSTEMIC MANIFESTATIONS: REQUEST FOR INFO
****************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Michael Fraze <mfraze@ibm.net>

My niece (28y/o F P0G0 in generally good health) acquired head lice from
my children who picked them up in grade school and subsequently
developed generalized lymphadenopathy, malaise, and perhaps fever w/mild
joint pain. The signs and symptoms had a cyclic course with general
shrinkage of all nodes though they remained firm and swollen to some
degree after 4-5 months. She has been seen by an Family Practitioner and an
Oncologist.
Lymphoma and other serious oncological conditions have been ruled out
and no infectious agent was identified. She recently was re-exposed to
head lice and her nodes apparently have again swollen though w/o
fatigue, malaise, or joint pain. Are there known systemic syndromes
associated with head lice infestations? I've looked in the standard
sources and can find no reference.
