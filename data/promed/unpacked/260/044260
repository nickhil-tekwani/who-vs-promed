Eighth Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection in New Jersey in 2001
----------------------------------------
The New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services today reported that
blood samples drawn from a 75 year-old Harrison (Hudson County) woman
reveal she was exposed to the West Nile virus (WNV) this summer. She is
currently in a good state of health and has returned to work. The woman,
who has a cardiac condition, was admitted in mid-August to West Hudson
Hospital with symptoms that included fever, nausea and a headache. She
regularly spent a great deal of time outdoors, and had traveled to the West
Coast and the Jersey Shore just prior to her hospitalization. Preliminary
infectious disease tests on the patient were negative. She was transferred
to St. Michael's Hospital in Newark for additional testing related to her
heart condition. Her health subsequently improved and she was discharged in
late August. Blood tests at a private lab, and in mid-September at the DHSS
lab, showed the patient had been exposed to WNV, but were inconclusive as
to whether the patient was infected this season or in a previous year. More
comprehensive tests conducted at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) confirmed late last week that the infection was from this
season.

"Because the patient did not have either meningitis or encephalitis, and
because blood samples tested in our lab were compatible with an infection
before this year, we could not say with confidence that her illness was due
to acute West Nile virus infection," said Assistant Commissioner and State
Epidemiologist Eddy Bresnitz, MD. "The additional tests conducted by the
CDC revealed an increase in antibody production from the initial to a
convalescent serum that is consistent with a more recent infection." Based
on the date of her onset of symptoms, the patient was most likely bitten by
an infected mosquito in late-July or early August. Since then, mosquito
control activities, colder weather and shorter days have reduced the risk
of further WNV transmission this year.

Confirmation of this case brings to 8 the number of New Jersey residents
detected with WNV this season. In addition to people, the virus has also
been found in 1071 crows, 322 mosquito pools and in 24 horses this year. In
2000, testing confirmed the presence of WNV in 6 state residents and
numerous birds, mosquitoes and horses.
