Ebola Situation Report - 1 Apr 2015
-----------------------------------
Summary
-------
A total of 82 new confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in the week to 29 Mar 2015, a slight increase compared with 79 cases the previous week. Case incidence in Guinea increased to 57, compared with 45 the previous week. This offset a 4th consecutive weekly fall in case incidence in Sierra Leone, which reported 25 confirmed cases. Liberia reported no confirmed cases over the same period.

In addition to an increase in case incidence in Guinea, the geographic area of transmission also increased. A total of 7 Guinean prefectures reported at least 1 confirmed case in the week to 29 Mar 2015, compared with 3 the previous week. 2 of the 7 prefectures that reported a new confirmed case, Fria and Siguiri, did so for the 1st time in over 50 days. Siguiri, which borders Mali, is the 1st prefecture outside the western area of Guinea to report a confirmed case for over 30 days.

In Sierra Leone, cases were reported from 5 northern and western districts around and including the capital Freetown, which reported 10 new confirmed cases. The neighbouring districts of Bombali (1 case), Kambia (5 cases), Port Loko (6 cases) and Western Rural (3 cases) also reported cases.

Response indicators for Guinea present a mixed picture. Of 35 confirmed deaths from EVD in the week to 29 Mar 2015 15 (43 per cent) were identified post-mortem in the community, compared with 10 of 37 (27 per cent) the previous week. This increase may be attributable to improved access to communities in Forecariah prefecture. The proportion of confirmed cases that arose among registered contacts increased from 38 per cent in the week to 15 Mar 2015 to 53 per cent in week to 22 Mar 2015. A total of 20 unsafe burials were reported in the week to 29 Mar 2015, compared with 26 the previous week.

A 45-day state of health emergency has been declared in the Guinean prefectures of Forecariah, Coyah, Dubreka, Boffa, and Kindia. The capital, Conakry, will also be subject to emergency measures, which include the restriction of movement in areas of transmission, the temporary closure and quarantine of private hospitals and clinics where EVD cases have been detected, and limitation of burial participation to close relatives only. All corpses will be tested for EVD during the 45-day emergency period.

The last confirmed case in Liberia passed away on 27 Mar 2015. Investigations are ongoing to establish the origin of infection. A total of 185 contacts associated with the case are being monitored twice a day. Heightened vigilance is being maintained throughout the country. In the week to 29 Mar 2015, 278 laboratory samples were tested for EVD, with no confirmed cases.

In the week to 29 Mar 2015, 67 per cent of confirmed cases in Sierra Leone came from registered contacts, compared with 84 per cent the previous week. There was one report of an unsafe burial over the same period. The proportion of confirmed deaths from EVD that were identified in the community increased slightly, from 7 of 56 (13 per cent) in the previous week to 8 of 52 (15 per cent) in the week to 29 Mar 2015. Heightened surveillance is being maintained: over 100 suspected cases were reported in the week to 29 Mar 2015, compared with 57 the previous week. The majority of suspected cases (52) were reported during the final 2 days of the 3-day stay-at-home.

There were 8 new health worker infections in the week to 29 Mar 2015: 7 in Guinea, and 1 in Sierra Leone. This brings the total number of health worker infections reported across the 3 most-affected countries since the start of the outbreak to 861, with 495 deaths.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
--------------------------------------------------
There have been a total of 25 178 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (table 1), with over 10 000 reported deaths (outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 57 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea, 0 in Liberia, and 25 in Sierra Leone in the 7 days to 29 Mar 2015.

The total number of confirmed and probable cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), people aged 15 to 44 are approximately 3 times more likely to be affected. People aged 45 and over are 3 to 5 times more likely to be affected than are children.

A total of 861 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 495 reported deaths (table 5).

[According to a report seen by Reuters, 1 of the 3 Ebola cases died in the community, 2 in the capital Conakry, 1 each in the towns of Dubreka and Forecariah. The local population in Conakry refused to hand over 2 other suspected cases, despite the intervention of local authorities. Families in the town of Coyah, 50 km (31 miles) from Conakry, had refused to follow contacts of an Ebola case. Authorities also said 12 Ebola contacts had slipped away from the Conakry suburb of Matoto for the eastern town of Siguiri near the Malian border. Approximately 50 people remain hospitalized in Ebola treatment units.

Fria is the site of Friguia, the only alumina smelter in the Guinea, which produced approximately 630 000 tonnes (694 456.126 US tons, 630 000 000 kg) of alumina a year until it was closed by Russian aluminum giant RUSAL in 2012.]

30 Mar 2015: Liberia Ebola survivors complain about lack of support
http://www.voanews.com/content/liberian-ebola-survivors-complain-about-lack-of-support/2699455.html
[As the number of Ebola cases is diminishing, the challenges are shifting in West Africa. Foremost, there needs to a focus on maintaining practices that prevent further infection, but also Ebola survivors need support. Ebola survivors face economic, psychological, and physical problems. The international and local communities must come together to help these individuals. - Mod.LK]

The remaining hotspots include the districts of Bombali and Kambia, and parts of Freetown (notably Elk Street, Leicester Road and Upper Kamara Town). Because of the number of suspected cases, confirmed-case numbers from this weekend are expected to rise slightly. In Liberia, at least 2 people, including the original (recently deceased) patient's student daughter, are in isolation for intense monitoring. 80 additional people are being quarantined at home. A suspected case has also been reported in Clara Town, Monrovia.]

http://www.ibtimes.com/ebola-update-us-patient-under-monitoring-suffers-cardiac-arrest-while-jogging-1863078
[1 of the 5 American aid workers being monitored in Nebraska for exposure to Ebola experienced cardiac arrest while jogging Sat [28 Mar 2015] and needed CPR (only chest compressions, not mouth-to-mouth resuscitation) from a bystander. Patient is in stable condition. The 5 health-care workers have been staying at the Nebraska Medical Center's campus for the past 2 weeks while they were being monitored. Wilson said that for most of that time the individuals remained in their rooms, but they had recently been allowed to venture out. See below -- they have now been released.]

30 Mar 2015: Reforming Liberia's Mining Sector Post-Ebola
http://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2015/03/30/reforming-liberias-mining-sector-post-ebola
[A recent study by the Sustainable Development Institute (SDI) reveals that Liberia earned too little from its mining operations long before Ebola coincided with the steep slump in iron ore prices in August 2014. With iron ore figures at their lowest since 2009 -- largely due to decreased demand for steel in China -- Liberia would benefit by diversifying its economy while holding mining companies accountable]

http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/666521-ebola-scare-shows-problems-in-computer-programs.html
[According to an article published in the British scientific journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, flaws in computer modeling led to apocalyptic forecasts of how Ebola virus would spread in West Africa. Many of the models were off-the-shelf software that failed to take into account complexities and uncertainties in the way the disease spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia]

31 Mar 2015: How many Americans could get Ebola? Study provides estimates
https://news.yahoo.com/many-americans-could-ebola-study-provides-estimates-152021215.html
[The aim of this study, which was to identify how many cases might need to be treated at any one time [in the United States] during an Ebola outbreak, was requested by policy makers as a way to plan for possible future US Ebola cases. Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate, under 2014 conditions, there could be as many as 14 US Ebola cases per month, and as few as 1 case per month. If each infected person stayed about 15 days in treatment, the average number of hospitals beds needed to treat US Ebola patients at any point in time could be as high as 7 and as low as 1. If Ebola cases arrived in clusters, the number of hospital beds needed could be higher, around 13 beds at any one time. The highest number of Ebola patients being treated simultaneously in the United States last year was 4. Travelers or health care workers with Ebola who didn't know they were infected before they traveled back to the US could infect as few as 0 and as many as 2 other people in the US, before or during their hospitalization.]
