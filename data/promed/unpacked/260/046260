["Infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN) is a serious viral disease of salmonid fish.

"Clinical infections are most common in young fish, particularly fry and juveniles. Infectious hematopoietic necrosis can have a major economic impact on farms that rear young rainbow trout or salmon; the cumulative mortality rates on these farms can reach 90-95 percent. Occasional epizootics have also been reported in wild salmon.

"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis is endemic in fish hatcheries and wild fish in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. Affected provinces and states include British Columbia, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California. Outbreaks have been reported in Minnesota, West Virginia, South Dakota, and Colorado. IHN is also endemic in continental Europe and Japan. In addition, outbreaks have been reported in Korea, Iran, and parts of China.
