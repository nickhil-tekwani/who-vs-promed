INFLUENZA, CANINE - USA (PENNSYLVANIA): CORRECTION

I believe that this latest posting on ProMed taken from the byline
<http://www.poconorecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070801/NEWS/708010338>
is incorrect in that a course of antibiotics will NOT "cure" canine
influenza in about a week. Canine influenza is a viral infection.
While antibiotics may prevent or cure a secondary bacterial
infection, antibiotics will not treat the true new strain of canine
influenza. This is an important distinction and the articles and
postings should be corrected.

[Mea culpa! Unfortunately Ms. Baker is correct. Antibiotics will not
cure an influenza infection. They will only reduce the chances, which
can be significant, of secondary bacterial infections. Distracted by
a doctor's appointment, which is no excuse, I didn't catch that error
and it got posted. I apologize to the members. - Mod.MHJ]
