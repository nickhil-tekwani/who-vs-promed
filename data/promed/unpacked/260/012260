Governor issues anthrax alert for Reno
--------------------------------------
LAS VEGAS -- State health officials are analyzing a letter addressed to
a Reno business that has tested presumptively positive for anthrax, a
spokesman for Gov. Kenny Guinn's office said. Additional testing to
confirm the presence of anthrax is expected to be completed by Saturday.
Guinn said that the state's emergency management system worked well in
getting the letter sealed, and that the employees at the company where
the letter was sent followed recommended emergency procedures. Guinn's
press secretary, Greg Bortolin, didn't immediately identify the company
that received the letter.
Guinn is advising all Nevadans that letters without return addresses,
empty envelopes and powdery substances should raise suspicions. These
kinds of items should be placed in a sealed bag or container and handed
over to authorities. Anyone coming in contact with these types of mail
should wash their hands and contact local public health officials. "This
is a national issue that involves law enforcement at all levels," Guinn
said. "The FBI has kept me well informed as these situations have
evolved."

Postal Service Issues Warning
-----------------------------
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Postal officials are urging people to be wary of
suspicious and unexpected mail following the discovery of a case of
anthrax in New York, possibly transmitted by mail. "We're advising
everybody to be cautious, particularly our employees," Postmaster
General John E. Potter said. "Obviously we have a heightened sense of
awareness."
Attorney General John Ashcroft said the FBI has begun a criminal
investigation of the case at the NBC television network.
Potter stressed that it has not been confirmed that the disease was
spread through the mail. But Ashcroft said a letter postmarked 25 Sep 2001
"may have transmitted the anthrax."
The case in New York follows 3 others [one case and 2 documented exposures]
in Florida, 2 of which involved mail [handlers]. Postal inspectors
regularly investigate threats of germs being sent through the mail, but if
confirmed, these would be the first documented cases of such an illness
occurring, the post office said. "We take this very, very seriously. We're
working closely with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to bring
back that sense of normalcy to America so that people have trust in the
mail," the postmaster general said.
Kenneth W. Newman, deputy chief inspector of investigations for the
Postal Inspection Service urged people to be cautious if they receive
suspicious mail. Characteristics postal inspectors say should trigger
suspicion include parcels that are unexpected or from someone
unfamiliar; are addressed to someone no longer with your organization;
have no return address, or have one that can't be verified; are of
unusual weight, given their size, or are lopsided or oddly shaped; are
marked with endorsements, such as "Personal" or "Confidential;" have
protruding wires, strange odors or stains, or show a city or state in
the postmark that doesn't match the return address.
In such cases, he said:
-- Do not try to open the parcel.
-- Isolate the parcel.
-- Evacuate the immediate area.
-- Call a postal inspector to report that you've received a parcel in
the mail that may contain biological or chemical substances. Potter said
people could also call local police, which cooperate with the postal
service.
"We handle 680 million pieces of mail a day. Obviously there are going
to be some pieces of mail that will draw concern," Potter said. Potter
said postal employees receive regular training in dealing with
potentially dangerous items. The American Postal Workers Union and
National Association of Letter Carriers said the agency had issued an
advisory to workers urging caution and advising the proper steps to take
with suspicious items.
During 1999 and 2000, the were approximately 178 anthrax threats
received at courthouses, abortion clinics, churches, schools and post
offices, the agency reported. So far this year there have been about 60
such threats or hoaxes. "We are investigating every incident where
somebody has a concern or suspicion about a piece of mail," Potter said
in a telephone interview. The postmaster general said he was concerned
that the increased attention to this threat "will cause others to follow
suit and that we may have some hoaxes out there. We need it to be
reinforced that we are going to do everything we can to track down the
source if there's a hoax and prosecute," he said.

[I have been asked to describe what a cutaneous anthrax lesion is like.
These are usually on the fingers, hands or forearms, but occasionally on
the face or lateral side of the eye -- i.e. where people have cuts or
insect bites &/or scratch themselves. The organism gains entry via these
minor abrasions and cuts. While it can take 2-4 days to develop I have
known it take 7-10 days before it appears. The area around the initial
infected area is inflamed, hot, and typically has small circling
vesicles or 'blisters'. What is absolutely typical is that the inflamed
lesion is painless. Later it ulcerates to be a round area, frequently
the size of a quarter, say 1.3 cms diameter, and with a blackened floor to
the ulcer. The affected person will have a raised temperature and feels
definitely ill or groggy. The inflamed area can become extensive.
Response to treatment is usually rapid. The lesion is so typical that it
can be identified from the circular scar years later.
The most dangerous cutaneous lesions are oropharyngeal because of the
real risk of asphyxiation and tracheotomy is usually called for in these
circumstances. In spite of the sometimes terrifying swelling and
inflammation (see any textbook for extreme examples) healing is usually
complete with little or no permanent damage.
My colleague Benyamin Cherkasskiy in Moscow tells me that he has had
only modest success, around 30%, in recovering organisms from cutaneous
lesions. However, the Russians utilise an anthracin skin test for
diagnosis, though I suspect it is more useful in retrodiagnoses. - Mod.MHJ]
