As it was stated in ProMED-mail, an outbreak of FMD affecting two premises
in the
county of Porto Murtinho, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, had been
detected by local veterinary authorities last February. Epithelium samples
were collected and sent to the Animal Support Laboratory at Recife,
Pernambuco, where FMD virus type "O1" was isolated.
The state of Mato Grosso do Sul in fact, is included in a large region at
the south of the continent where no FMD cases has been detected during the
last years. Chile and Uruguay are countries recognized by the OIE as free of
FMD without vaccination (Chile last case 1987, Uruguay 1990); Argentina and
Paraguay are also recognized by the OIE as countries free of FMD but with
vaccination (Argentina last case 1994, Paraguay 1994).
As for the southern states of Brazil, some of them in process to be
recognized by OIE: Rio Grande do Sul last case was in December 1993 as well
Santa Catarina; Parana in May 1995 and Goias in August 1995.
Mato Grosso do Sul last previous report of FMD was in December 1994.
At the northern part of the continent there is also another region with no
FMD cases since a long time comprising the state of Roraima, Brazil, since
January 1995 and the neighbor countries of French Guayana since 1953, Guyana
since 1978 and Suriname that was never affected.
In Colombia, the northwest of Choco department is a known FMD free area part
of the Darien buffer zone.
