A Hong Kong laboratory recognised by the World Health Organisation
has confirmed 4 more human bird flu cases in Indonesia, including 2
deaths, a senior Indonesian Health Ministry official said on Sat [4
Feb 2006]. Hariadi Wibisono, the Ministry's Director of Control of
Animal-borne Diseases, said that this raised Indonesia's total
confirmed human bird flu cases to 23. "There are now 23 confirmed
cases in Indonesia. Of these, 16 have died," Wibisono told Reuters.
Turkey and Iraq in January 2006 became the latest countries outside
Asia to report human cases of the H5N1 strain of avian flu. While it
mostly affects birds, avian influenza has infected 161 people and
killed 86 of them since 2003, according to the World Health Organization.
Wibisono said the newly confirmed Indonesian deaths were of a
22-year-old male chicken seller from Jakarta who died late in January
and a 15-year-old boy who died in the West Java city of Bandung this week.
Those still alive included a 5-year-old girl from around the town of
Indramayu in West Java province and a 5-year-old boy from the
province of Lampung on the island of Sumatra. The girl came from an
area near where 2 Indonesian children from the same family died of
bird flu in January, Wibisono said. The girl was unrelated to them.
The boy was an older case in which initial tests had proven
inconclusive, he added. Most Indonesian cases have shown the victims
had contact with dead chickens.
The highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus has
affected birds in 2/3 of the provinces in Indonesia, an archipelago
of about 17 000 islands and 220 million people. The country has
millions of chickens and ducks, many in the yards of rural or urban
homes, making it likely that more humans will become infected with the virus.
