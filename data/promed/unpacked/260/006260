A case of Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA) has been diagnosed in M端lligen, canton Aargau; this is the 1st case of EIA in Switzerland since 1991. EIA is notifiable for horses and other solipeds like donkeys and mules. The cantonal veterinary service has declared the Birrfeld area as a restricted zone for the said. The disease does not affect humans and other animal species.

So far, there is no evidence that the disease has spread beyond M端lligen.

Infected animals, such as the one in M端lligen, must be killed. The remaining horses kept in the stable are placed under quarantine and should be strictly watched as required by the cantonal veterinary service.

The disease is transmitted by arthropods; all horses and other solipeds kept in the restricted area may be left in the open if they have been previously protected by effective insecticides.

According to the Animal Disease Regulation, a restricted area of one km [approx. 0.62 miles] around the contaminated horse farm should be implemented. Therefore, the cantonal veterinary service has declared the entire Birrfeld area to the restricted area [map included; see source url].

Within the said zone, all trade and traffic with horses is prohibited for 90 days. Horses and other solipeds should enter or leave the restricted area only with the written authorization of the cantonal veterinary service. Exhibitions, tournaments and similar events are prohibited in the restricted area until the cantonal veterinary service repeals the restricted area; presumably, after expiry of the statutory period of 90 days.

Not affected by the measure is the transport of horses across the highway.

[Switzerland has become the 3rd European country involved in the EIA event which reportedly started in Germany on 2 Jan 2017 and in the Netherlands on 28 Jun 2017.

According to the following update of the transboundary event (summarized), published by the German web-site "wir-sind-vet" ("we are vets"), so far 15 horses have been officially confirmed as EIA-infected, of which 13 in Germany, one in the Netherlands and one in Switzerland. Most if not all the involved animals are polo horses; M端lligen is located in the Canton of Aargau, home to one of the 10 Swiss poloclubs. Officially the reference to the polo sport is not confirmed, but the restricted area includes the address of the club. No evidence for direct connection between the Dutch case and Germany could be found so far; the horse from the Poloclub Vreeland (Utrecht / 63 horses) was never in Germany according to Bob Rademakers, secretary of the Dutch polo association. According to the daily Bildzeitung, the horses infected in Hamburg were all from the same stable in Argentina and came to Germany 5 years ago. Even horses tested positive in other countries would come from that Argentine barn. This has been confirmed by a spokesman for the Altona district in Hamburg.

According to "wir-sind-vet", the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI - National Reference Laboratory for EIA) has also confirmed the connection with the polo sport. The track to Argentina, however, is not officially communicated by the FLI. The above and additional information, including a map of the German locations where positive horses have been detected, is available at http://www.wir-sind-tierarzt.de/2017/07/equine-infektioese-anaemie-ausbrueche/. (Thanks to communicator SZ for providing the link).

Some of the above cited data are still in need of authoritative confirmation.

Subscribers are reminded about the lifelong, persisting infection in EIA-affected horses, which could be subclinical; hence, the term "outbreak" should not be regarded always as indicative of a new, fresh EIA case. Though apparently a "rolling event", detection of new cases/affected countries does not necessarily reflect a sequential order of infection. - Mod.AS
