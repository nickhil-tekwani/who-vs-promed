2004/146 Results of the 2003/2004 surveys on Pepino mosaic potexvirus done
in United Kingdom
Official surveys for Pepino mosaic potexvirus (PepMV - EPPO Alert List)
were done in United Kingdom from 1 Aug 2003 to 31 Jul 2004. Inspections
were made at premises involved in the production of tomato plants and
fruit, as well as on tomato fruit, seed and other material moving in trade.
Samples were tested by ELISA.
Premises involved in the production of tomato plants:
36 premises were visited (6 were propagators registered for plant
passporting and 30 were premises producing or selling tomato plants for
retail only). 65 inspections were made, 8 samples were submitted -- all
were negative. All samples were taken from propagators authorised for plant
passporting.
Premises involved in the production of tomato fruit:
63 premises were visited, 133 inspections were made and 58 samples were
taken. 22 were positive from 6 premises (England and Wales). 5 outbreaks of
PepMV were confirmed on nurseries during the reporting period where
statutory action was taken.
Fruit moving in trade:
42 premises were visited and 243 inspections were made. 40 samples of
imported fruit were tested, of which 36 were positive. The origin of the
positive samples was: Spain (mainland: 14; Canary Isles: 19), Netherlands (3).
Seeds:
5 premises were visited. 2 were from propagators, all 25 samples were
negative. 2 were from growers, from whom 7 samples were taken and 1 sample
originating from the Netherlands tested positive.
The situation of PepMV in United Kingdom can be described as follows:
Present, 5 outbreaks were detected in 2003/2004 only in tomatoes grown for
fruit production, under official control.

[PepMV is extremely contagious, and disease management requires strict
adherence to phytosanitary measures. The high incidence of PepMV infection
in fruits originating in Spain, the Canary Islands and the Netherlands is
cause for concern, because international trade of infected fruits can
spread the virus to other jurisdictions. - Mod.DH]
