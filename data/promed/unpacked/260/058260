Kenyans are now living in fear after a strange disease broke out in Tharaka Nithi County, claiming 5 lives in a matter of months. According to information from health officials, the rare and strange disease known as kala-azar has so far infected 33 individuals over the last few months. This has put the county on a high alert, taking necessary steps to contain the outbreak.

Kala-azar, scientifically referred to as visceral leishmaniasis (VL), is characterized by irregular bouts of fever and anemia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), kala-azar is also characterised by weight loss and enlargement of the spleen and liver.

The disease is caused by parasites and transmitted through the bites of infected female sand flies. The infection rates vary from person to person. People with HIV have a high chance of going full-blown once infested by the disease. The disease is mainly attracted by poor hygienic conditions, malnutrition, and environmental changes. However, the disease is treatable and curable once detected in its early stages.

[ProMED thanks Dr Orabi for alerting us to this outbreak. A review of leishmaniasis including in Kenya by J Alvar and colleagues (1) states: "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) seems to have been imported in Kenya by soldiers returning from southern Ethiopia after the Second World War. The disease spread with epidemic resurgences in different foci during the years that followed. Since 1980, the number of reported cases increased considerably and expanded into new areas.

"Risk factors for VL have been studied and a good correlation was established between the proximity of houses or temporary settlements to termite hills and the risk of transmission. Having a low socioeconomic status and treating livestock with insecticide were also identified as risk factors for VL. Sleeping near animals, owning a mosquito net, and knowing about VL symptoms were associated with a reduced risk of VL. Transmission is believed to be mainly anthroponotic."

According to this review, visceral leishmaniasis is new to Tharaka Nithi County.
