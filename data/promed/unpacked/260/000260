Fears that contagious bee disease has spread
--------------------------------------------
The contagious bee disease American foul brood (AFB) has now surfaced
beyond the so called "capensis line", raising fears it could have
spread from Cape honey bees to the African honey bee. The "capensis
line" is a management barrier intended to keep the Cape honey bee
_Apis mellifera capensis_ separate from the African variety _Apis
mellifera scutellata_. It runs approximately from Port Elizabeth
through Cradock and up to about the Gariep (Orange) River. The
Department of Agriculture has meanwhile begged for the co-operation
of all bee farmers and stakeholders, although a management plan to
deal with the disease has not yet been finalised.

The bacteria -- deadly to bee colonies -- were found in 4 out of 24
tested bulk honey samples north of the line, Department of
Agriculture spokeswoman Priscilla Sehoole said yesterday [28 Jul
2009]. Whether or not the disease had breached the line in bee
colonies themselves would only be revealed in test samples. But these
continue to trickle in slowly, now 2 weeks over deadline and too late
to show the spread of disease before pollination season.

Bee farmers are already moving thousands of colonies throughout the
province to provide pollination services to deciduous fruit and onion
seed farmers.

According to 258 test results so far, 30 percent of hives south of
the capensis line are infected in Bonnievale, Cape Town, Ceres,
Durbanville, Fish Hoek, Grabouw, Hermanus, Maitland, Milnerton,
Montagu, Oudtshoorn, Paarl, Stellenbosch, Uniondale, Vredendal,
Wellington, and Worcester. "It is feared that more areas could test
positive as the delimiting survey continues in the next 3 weeks," Sehoole said.

She said a biosecurity protocol and AFB management plan had still not
been finalised, but it had been prioritised. "More than ever, full
co-operation of all stakeholders is required in order to control the
spread. The government cannot do this alone." Her comments followed a
meeting between the department, scientists, and representatives in
the bee industry at the weekend [25-26 Jul 2009]. Speaking to the
Cape Times last week, visiting New Zealand Bee Keepers' Association
vice-president Neil Farrer said until bee keepers and government
agencies worked together, "it's a state of floundering."

New Zealand, which has had the disease since 1870, currently holds
AFB's spread at around one percent. Bee keepers there are required by
law to report the disease within one week of finding it.

Agricultural Research Council bee researcher Mike Allsopp was not
available for comment, but in a working "AFB Road Map" being
circulated in the industry, he said little was known about how the
disease would affect the industry. "We do not know if 1 percent, 5
percent, 50 percent, or 99 percent of colonies infected with AFB will
die from it... And we know nothing about the effect on the _Apis
mellifera scutellata_ population, commercial and wild."

[According to Wikipedia: "American foul brood (AFB), caused by the
spore-forming _Paenibacillus larvae_ ssp. _larvae_ (formerly
classified as _Bacillus larvae_), is the most widespread and
destructive of the bee brood diseases. _Paenibacillus larvae_ is a
rod-shaped bacterium, which is visible only under a high power
microscope. Larvae up to 3 days old become infected by ingesting
spores that are present in their food. Young larvae less than 24
hours old are most susceptible to infection. Spores germinate in the
gut of the larva and the vegetative form of the bacteria begins to
grow, taking its nourishment from the larva. Spores will not
germinate in larvae over 3 days old. Infected larvae normally die
after their cell is sealed. The vegetative form of the bacterium will
die but not before it produces many millions of spores. Each dead
larva may contain as many as 100 million spores. This disease only
affects the bee larvae but is highly infectious and deadly to bee
brood. Infected larvae darken and die."
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diseases_of_the_honey_bee#American_foulbrood_.28AFB.29>)

According to my apiarist friend Jose Villa "AFB is a well documented
bacterial disease and can be very destructive. It is pretty much a
non-issue if beekeepers use antibiotics OR hygienic bees. In the days
before antibiotics it was THE main problem of beekeepers and probably
the primary justification for state inspection services."
