The World Health Organization (WHO) reported an additional 629 monkeypox cases in the past 6 weeks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

Also reported are 6 additional monkeypox fatalities.

Since the beginning of the year [2021] through 8 Aug [2021], 2523 cases have been reported with 66 deaths.

In 2020, a total of 6257 suspected cases including 229 deaths (CFR 3.7%) were reported in 133 health zones from 17 out of 26 provinces in the country.

Monkeypox, a rare zoonosis that occurs sporadically in forested areas of Central and West Africa, is an orthopoxvirus that can cause fatal illness.

The disease manifestations are similar to human smallpox (eradicated since 1980), however human monkeypox is less severe. The disease is self-limiting with symptoms usually resolving within 14-21 days. Treatment is supportive.

The virus is transmitted through direct contact with blood, bodily fluids and cutaneous/mucosal lesions of an infected animal (monkeys, chimpanzees, rats, squirrels, dormice, striped mice, and other rodents). Secondary human-to-human transmission is limited but can occur via exposure to respiratory droplets, contact with infected persons or contaminated materials.

[Monkeypox (MPX) virus transmission continues to be active in DR Congo this year (2021). Case numbers have increased from 1515 with 49 deaths on 16 May 2021 to 2523 with 66 deaths as of 8 Aug 2021. It is not clear how many of the reported cases above are laboratory confirmed. One wonders if many of the reported suspected cases that have not been laboratory confirmed may be chickenpox, caused by varicella-zoster virus. There is no specific information about the circumstances under which these cases acquired their infection. However, as the report above mentions, contact with infected carrier rodents or other wild mammals may be the source of MPX virus transmission. - Mod.TY
