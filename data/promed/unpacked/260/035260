A national outbreak of a disease that has already killed about 7 percent of the country's baby pigs is expected to drive the price of pork up in coming months, said Sam Hines, executive vice president of Michigan Pork Producers.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [PEDV], detected here on an Allegan County farm last summer [2013], was 1st discovered in the United States in April 2013. The disease is deadly to newborn piglets but does not affect the safety of pork nor is it a human health concern, said Jennifer Holton, director of communications for the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD).

PEDV is not a disease farmers are required to report, but as of 9 Apr 2014, agriculture officials knew of 93 farms in Michigan affected by the disease, she said.

It's a major economic concern for Michigan's swine industry," she said, and MDARD is working with farmers and veterinarians to try to reduce its spread and impact. Unfortunately, though, "there is very little you can do," Hines said.

"Researchers have said it is one of the most contagious they have ever seen," Hines said. One scientist trying to determine how dilute a solution could infect pigs expressed it this way, Hines said: "If you cut the eraser off a pencil and put that much (virus) in 26 000 gallons of water, it would still infect animals. The bottom line is it is an extremely infectious virus."

At this point, scientists are not sure how the virus is spread, nor is a vaccine available to prevent the disease.

Older pigs contract it but get over it, Hines said, and some farmers have turned to purposely exposing their healthy sows to others that have the disease prior to farrowing to help build natural immunity, he said. "It's about the only option right now," to prevent piglets from the severe diarrhea that dehydrates young pigs to the point that they are unable to recover, he said.

Nationwide, agriculture officials estimate that more than 6 million piglets -- 6-7 percent of this year's [2014] pig crop -- have died. As of last week, the disease had been found in 28 states.

Hines said the national pork board has put forward USD 1.7 million in emergency research to develop a possible vaccine; an appropriation of USD 30 million in federal money has been set aside, though not yet approved, for research and study, Hines said. "It's so new to this country, they haven't done a lot of work yet," he said.

Hines said the virus has been genetically sequenced and matches a virus in China. The US herd is extremely vulnerable to the disease because pigs here have never been exposed to it before.

Because the US does not import hogs or meat from China, it is believed the virus probably was brought here on a feed ingredient of some sort, Hines said.

Although the impact on consumer prices will be most slightly later in the summer [2014], when this crop of hogs is set to go to market, prices are already at record highs, he said.

In spite of the increasing price of pork, consumer demand remains high, Hines said, possibly because beef prices remain high in the wake of droughts that reduced the size of the nation's beef herd.

"Beef cattle numbers are the lowest they have been since the 1950s," he said. "People don't have a lot of alternative choices at the meat case. The highest pork prices will likely be coming down the road, he said, with the bulk of the losses from December [2014] through March [2015]. "We haven't seen the full impact yet. I would guess retail prices will escalate 10-15 percent on average," he said.

[This virus causes a nasty disease, and, sadly, as this article points out, there is no vaccine, and work on this virus seems limited.
