Information received on 30 Nov 2010 from Mr Tritsadee
Chaosuancharoen, Deputy Director General, Department of Livestock
Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Bangkok, Thailand

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Start date 6 Nov 2010
Date of 1st confirmation of the event 21 Nov 2010
Report date 30 Nov 2010
Date submitted to OIE 30 Nov 2010
Reason for notification: Unexpected increase in morbidity or
mortality of a listed disease

Summary description: An increase in the morbidity/mortality has been
observed in the area of Amphur Ban-Ra-Kam (Phitsanulok province), and
PRRS is suspected based on clinical signs. After the Department of
Livestock Development was notified, an investigation team was sent to
the area and immediately launched disease control measures in order
to contain the disease. In total, 660 out of about 2970 pigs from 90
small pig holders in the province were infected. The clinical
presentation of the disease varies among herds but, in general, the
clinical signs are: fever, anorexia, lethargy, cutaneous hyperemia,
dyspnea and reproductive failure. The production system that has been
affected is mainly the backyard sector with low biosecurity. Samples
were collected and sent to the Lower Northern Laboratory of
Veterinary Research and Development Centre for further confirmation.
The source of infection is still under investigation and will be
summarized to understand the possible origin of!
the disease in order to implement appropriate control and
prevention measures.

Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection Under investigation
by veterinary authorities

Epidemiological comments: Clinical signs according to the PRRS case
definition have been detected. It is characterized by reproductive
failure and respiratory distress, which can affect all age groups of
pigs. Surveillance is carried out in and outside the area of the
infected farms. A public awareness campaign has been launched to
provide information, education and communication to all target
audiences in order to educate farmers about PRRS and encourage them
to enhance their biosecurity level by applying basic principles.

Increased Distribution
The areas and species that have recently become affected by the
disease: PHITSANULOK Swine

Disease Impact

Increased Incidence PHITSANULOK Swine 3.33 to over 37.78 percent
Increased Morbidity PHITSANULOK Swine 10 to over 24 percent
Increased Mortality PHITSANULOK Swine 5 to over 22 percent

Control measures
Measures applied - Quarantine; Movement control inside the country;
Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); No vaccination
Treatment of affected animals (Supportive treatment of sick animals.
PRRS is a viral disease, so there is no specific treatment.
Supportive measures can reduce losses from co-infection. They include
the use of antibiotics and supplements such as vitamins and
electrolytes to increase the immunity of sick pigs.)

Measures to be applied - Screening; Zoning

Laboratory name and type: Lower Northern Laboratory of Veterinary
Research and Development Centre (Local laboratory)
Species Swine
Test polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Test date
Result Pending

Future Reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The Thai Animal Health Authorities are to be commended on acting on
clinical signs of disease in a rapid, efficient manner. It is
certainly prudent to do so, because of their familiarity with the
disease and the increasing trend of PPRS outbreaks.

The OIE WAHID database indicates that no outbreaks were recorded from
the beginning of 2005 to middle of 2007. For the last 6 months of
2007, 16 outbreaks were recorded. In 2008, only 18 outbreaks were
recorded, but afterwards, an increasing trend in the number of
outbreaks can be pretty easily observed, with 35 outbreaks in 2009
and 69 outbreaks in 2010 to date. Given this type of increasing
incidence situation, surveillance and public education campaigns are
certainly 2 commendable tactics in attempting to control the disease,
especially when backyard flocks are involved.

Unfortunately in Asia, China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea have also
experienced high levels of outbreaks over the past several years. For
details, please see the excellent information available in the OIE
WAHID database. Other countries like Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia have
also recently had problems. - Mod.PC]
