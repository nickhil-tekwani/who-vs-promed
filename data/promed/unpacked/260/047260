Monkeys provide malaria reservoir for human disease in Southeast Asia
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Monkeys infected with an emerging malaria strain are providing a
reservoir for human disease in Southeast Asia, according to research
published today [8 Apr 2011]. The Wellcome Trust funded study confirms
that the species has not yet adapted to humans and that monkeys are
the main source of infection.

There are 5 species of malaria parasite that are known to cause
disease in humans, of which _Plasmodium knowlesi_ is the most recently
identified. Previously thought to only infect monkeys, researchers
have shown that human _P. knowlesi_ infections are widely distributed
in Southeast Asia and that it is a significant cause of malaria in
Malaysian Borneo.

Until now, it was not clear whether the infection is transmitted from
person to person, or is passed over from infected monkeys.
Researchers led by Professor Balbir Singh at the Malaria Research
Centre, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, collaborating with Sarawak State
Health Department, St George's University of London and the London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, examined blood samples from
108 wild macaques from different locations around the Sarawak division
of Malaysian Borneo.

Their results reveal that 78 percent were infected with the _P.
knowlesi_ species of malaria parasite, and many were infected with one
or more of 4 other species of monkey malaria parasites that have not
yet been found in humans. By comparing the molecular identity of the
parasites from monkeys and those isolated from patients with knowlesi
malaria, the team were able to build a picture of the evolutionary
history of the parasite and its preferred host.

Their analysis reveals that transmission of the knowlesi species is
more common amongst wild monkeys than from monkeys to humans, and that
monkeys remain the dominant host. "Our findings strongly indicate that
_P. knowlesi_ is a zoonosis in this area, that is to say it is passed
by mosquitoes from infected monkeys to humans, with monkeys acting as
a reservoir host," explains Professor Singh.

"However, with deforestation threatening the monkeys' habitat and
increases in the human population, it's easy to see how this species
of malaria could switch to humans as the preferred host. This would
also hamper current efforts aimed at eliminating malaria."

Based on the molecular data, the researchers estimate that the
knowlesi malaria species evolved from its ancestral species between 98
000 and 478 000 years ago. This predates human settlement in the area,
meaning that monkeys are mostly likely to have been the initial host
for the parasite when the species 1st emerged. This estimate also
indicates that the species is as old as, or older than, the 2 most
common human malaria parasites, _P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_. The
study is published today in the journal PLoS Pathogens.

2011.

The authors surveyed 108 wild monkeys and found most were infected
with malaria parasites, including _P. knowlesi_. The study found that
the number of _P. knowlesi_ genotypes per infection was much higher in
monkeys than humans, some genotypes were shared between the 2 hosts
and no major types were associated exclusively with either host.

Over the past few years scattered reports of human _P. knowlesi_
infections have appeared from Indonesia (Borneo) Malaysia (Borneo),
Thailand, Viet Nam and the Philippines.

The present paper shows that human _P. knowlesi_ infection is in fact
a zoonosis and is widespread throughout Southeast Asia. - Mod.EP]
