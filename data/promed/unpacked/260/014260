GIDEON lists the following taxa as human pathogens transmitted by dog bite:
Bergeyella zoohelcum
Bisgaard's taxon 16
CDC groups NO-1, EF-4a, EF-4b
Capnocytophaga canimorsus
Capnocytophaga cynodegmi
Neisseria canis
Pasteurella canis
Pasteurella dagmatis
Pasteurella pneumotrophica
Pasteurella stomatis
Psychrobacter immobilis
Streptococcus group L
The concurrent epizootic among pigs raises the possibility that dog bites
may be serving as a vehicle for a pig pathogen. The list of potential human
pathogens carried by pigs is extensive, and includes _Erysipelothrix
rhusopathiae_, Pseudomonads (and _Burkhoderia_ species), and variety of
anaerobic bacteria which may cause severe systemic and soft tissue infection.

A one week incubation period for humans, even for a head bite, would be
unusually short for rabies. 3 to 8 weeks would be much more common. There
have been reports of incubation periods over a year post rabies exposure.

It is not that unusual to see a rather long delay from bite to first
symptoms of rabies. Cases have been reported to present many months after a
bite. If the cases fit the clinical presentation, these cases should be
evaluated for rabies. We certainly need much more information about these
cases.

This might well be Rabies. I seem to remember a case from KwaZulu-Natal many
years back, when the human victim died a month or two after the bite. It all
depends where the virus enters a nerve tract (i.e. the bite-to-brain
distance).

[The original report could be read two ways - as above on the normal
interval between dog bite and onset of rabid symptoms, or that the patients
had not died within a week or so of the onset of symptoms, which might have
started very soon after the dog bites - thanks to translation & journalistic
errors. With three dead and 51 hospitalised there should be an adequacy of
autopsy and laboratory results to confirm this either way. If we could get
an update from any members in Indonesia, it would be appreciated. - Mod.MHJ
