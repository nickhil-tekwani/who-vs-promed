[The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Mongolia is available at
<http://healthmap.org/r/00di>.

This report from OIE only indicates migratory swans. Previous reports,
kindly forwarded by Martin Gilbert (ProMED ref. (39) below), have
indicated that the birds involved are a total number of 121 wild birds
that died, including 107 great crested grebe, 3 bar-headed geese, and
11 brown-headed gulls. Furthermore, it has been documented by Diann
Prosser (ProMED ref. (40) below), and other investigators, that
bar-heeded geese have followed a similar migratory route through China
to central Mongolia in recent years.

The full details are informative and can be found in the references
below. This kind of pattern recognition is key if we are going to
develop smart epidemiologic intelligence, which provides a
comprehensive picture of the changing dynamics of influenza not only
in wild birds but all species. - Mod.PC]
