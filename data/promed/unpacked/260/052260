At least 5 cases of Q fever have been detected in the Baltzola caves by the Health Department of the Basque Government since last December [2020]. Climbers use the interior of these cavities to train throughout the year. The outbreak of this disease forced closure on Friday [30 Apr 2021] of this natural space located in Dima and a popular destination for families and hikers on festive days such as Easter [4 Apr 2021].

The mayor of the town, Josu Gorospe, told DEIA yesterday [30 Apr 2021], that "on Friday morning we received an email from the Health Department of the Basque Government telling us to close the caves due to the appearance of Q fever cases." For this reason, signs have been placed at the 2 entrances to this karst complex, from the Indusi area and from the San Lorenzo hermitage.

This disease is an infection by a germ called _Coxiella burnetii_ that is found in some animals, usually cows, sheep, or goats. This organism is usually spread by the wind and inhaled reaching the lungs. Acute infection is characterized in humans by fever, headache, and muscle pain, accompanied by lung infection and liver involvement.

According to the mayor, "At first, it was not known what the affected climbers had until this [Q] fever was diagnosed and that it could originate from the place where they train." For decades the Baltzola caves have been a training area for dozens of climbers, who have covered their walls and roof with anchors for their vertical and horizontal routes.

The Public Health Directorate is investigating the exact cause of the outbreak, but the mayor told this newspaper yesterday [30 Apr 2021] that "it is possible that it may have come from the animals that roam free in the area and take refuge in the caves where they defecate and leave remains."

While trying to find out exactly what happened, "the area will remain closed until further notice", said the mayor. He also said that "it is possible that the whole place will have to be disinfected", and it will have to be determined whose responsibility it is. When cases of Q fever were detected years ago in several employees of the Artigas Mechanical Biological Treatment (TMB) plant, it was the company that carried out the disinfection. The last 2 cases in the plant were detected last March [2021] [see ProMED-mail post Q fever - Spain: (PV) recurrent, waste treatment facility, RFI 20210327.8273195].

A young woman from Biscay who is fond of climbing, visited the Baltzola caves last weekend [24-25 Apr 2021], although it is not one of the areas she usually frequents. "There were a lot of people climbing and many, many visitors," she recalls. The news of the infections has taken her completely by surprise. "We didn't hear anything from the others we had gone with and nobody warned us that something like this had happened. We were going in and crawling through the caves and no one warned us of any danger. There were no signs and, in fact, it was full of people," she explained.

"Although the cases have been among climbers, anyone can be infected if, as it seems, it is transmitted through the air. The only difference is that we do have more direct contact with the surfaces with our hands," she said, still stunned by what happened.

A video showing people "bouldering" in the Baltzola caves in the Basque region of Spain can be seen at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6Ok3yHhyLs. Bouldering is a type of free climbing performed on small rock formations that doesn't require a rope or harness because you only climb up to 12-15 feet (3-5 m) and use "bouldering mats" on the ground to prevent injuries from falls (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering). Bouldering has been used to train for roped climbs and mountaineering, although it is a sport in its own right. The Baltzola caves are 31 km (19 mi) southeast of the city of Bilbao. The location of Baltzola can be found on a map at https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Bilbao,+Biscay,+Spain/Cuevas+de+Baltzola,+Baltzola+Auzoa,+1,+48141,+Bizkaia,+Spain.

ProMED recently posted an outbreak of Q fever at the Mechanical Biological Treatment Plant (TMB), a waste treatment facility also in the Basque region, in 2018 and recently in March 2021. TMB, located in a mountainous area on the western outskirts of Bilbao, reportedly handled at the time the urban waste from the city of Bilbao. TMP was also the site of a prior Q fever outbreak in 2014. (See ProMED posts Q fever - Spain: (PV) waste treatment facility 20180411.5739737 and Q fever - Spain: (PV) recurrent, waste treatment facility, RFI 20210327.8273195). Previous Q fever outbreaks at this facility were said to have forced interruption of activity at the facility for several months to empty the pit and the tunnels to eradicate the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_, the cause of Q fever.

_C. burnetii_ is an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Q fever is attributed to a small-cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. Q fever is a zoonosis. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), myocarditis, and central nervous system involvement. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage.

Q fever is distributed worldwide, with the exception of New Zealand. Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats and for laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures and working with _C. burnetii_-infected animals (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88923/). Sporadic cases occur in people living in urban areas that are downwind from farms or abattoirs where the organisms have become aerosolized. Occasional cases follow contact with farm animals or after contact with infected pets such as dogs and cats.

Q fever is diagnosed predominantly in northern Spain, especially in the Basque Country and Navarre provinces, supposedly because of the greater cattle-raising activities in these areas (Maurin M, Raoult D: Q Fever. Clin Microbiol Rev. 1999; 12(4): 518-553; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88923/). A large number of cases have been also diagnosed in the Madrid area. Q fever most often presents as pneumonia in the Basque region in northern Spain, where Q fever is said to be the 2nd most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, whereas hepatitis is predominant in Andalusia in southern Spain. Most cases occur between March and July, corresponding to the peak in the lambing season.

The sources of _C. burnetii_ for the cases at the TMB and now in the Baltzola caves are not specified in the news report above. Perhaps disturbance of soil contaminated with _C. burnetii_ by infected cattle, sheep, or goats in this Q fever-endemic region of Spain is at fault. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Because of the presence of bats in caves, cave exploration is also a known risk factor for histoplasmosis, which is sometimes known as "cave fever" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10403317). Physicians should be aware of the association between histoplasmosis and caving when caring for individuals who develop an acute febrile respiratory illness after cave exploration (http://tinyurl.com/yxjust7x). Another febrile disease that has also acquired the name "cave fever" is tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF). See ProMED posts Tick-borne relapsing fever - Israel: spelunkers, tourists 20180422.5761531 and Tick-borne relapsing fever - USA: (TX) cave workers, 2017 20180420.5759542.

Bilbao is located 16 km (10 mi) south of the Bay of Biscay. With a population of 345 141 residents as of 2015, it is the largest city in northern Spain; the Bilbao metropolitan area has about 1 million residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbao). - Mod.ML
