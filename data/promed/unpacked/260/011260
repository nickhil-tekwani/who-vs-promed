Dengue Fever Hits 6 Areas in Singapore
---------------------------------------------------
6 areas in Singapore have been identified to have dengue fever.
Each area has had 2 or more cases within 150 metres, occurring
within a 2-week period.

Dengue cases reached a peak last year [2003]. A total of 4772
people fell ill with the disease -- the highest number since 1998.

On Saturday, the National Environment Agency (NEA) came up
with a plan to bolster its 700-strong Dengue Prevention Volunteer
Group. By the end of 2005, 2000 primary school children will have
been trained by the NEA to identify mosquito breeding areas.
Called Mozzie Busters, the youngsters will help keep an eye out for
stagnant water in their homes and neighbourhoods.

With 6 people dying last year [2003] from the disease and 4644
people hospitalised, urgent prevention work is needed to stop
mosquitoes from breeding, particularly in households. During 2003,
796 households were found breeding mosquitoes, a jump of over
50 percent compared to 2001.

Homeowners were issued warning letters after they were found
breeding mosquitos, and 451 households were slapped with a fine
after they failed to get rid of the breeding areas. Another 5349
households were also warned for having environments conducive
to breeding mosquitos. The NEA says 56 out of every 1000 landed
properties inspected were found with mosquitoes.

The 6 clusters with outbreaks of dengue fever are Cornwall
Gardens and the Holland area, Marine Terrace and Marine
Crescent, Hougang Avenues 8 and 10, Simei Street 3, Thomson
Ridge and Sawnage Road, in the Tanjong Katong area.

Dengue spreads in Trincomalee town, Sri Lanka
------------------------------------------------------------
The North East Provincial health department Friday launched an
Emergency awareness campaign in Trincomalee to educate the
residents of the eastern port town against the spread of dengue
fever, after medical officials detected 11 suspected positive cases
in recent days, sources said. One death had taken place in the
heart of Trincomalee town, said a health official.

Health officials sought the assistance of students in a house-to-
house campaign to educate the residents to keep their houses and
premises clean and to destroy all discarded coconut shells, tyres,
empty tins and bottles, which are considered breeding grounds for
mosquitoes.

17 dead, thousands sickened by dengue in Jakarta
----------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of dengue fever has killed 17 people in the Indonesian
capital and infected thousands more, health officials said Monday.

As of Monday, health officials in Jakarta said 2518 people in the
capital had been hospitalized for the mosquito-borne disease --
twice the number hospitalized in 2003. Health officials attributed
the rise to heavy rains in recent weeks, and the failure to rid the
capital of stagnant water and other breeding spots for mosquitos.
With a population of 11 million, Jakarta's crowded conditions and
poor sanitation are also a contributing factor in any outbreak.

The World Health Organization estimates that dengue fever infects
nearly 100 million people worldwide each year, and about 5 percent
die.

Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's Department of Health
confirmed Friday an imported case of dengue fever and urged the
public to guard against the disease. The new case is the 7th
reported case in Hong Kong in 2004. All of the reported cases are
imported, said the department.

A 27-year-old man developed fever and headache on 31 Jan
2004, after he traveled to southeast Asian countries on 10 Jan
2004. He returned to Hong Kong on 3 Feb 2004. He has since
recovered and been discharged from Hong Kong's Prince of
Wales Hospital.

The department said it is essential that the public stay alert to the
threat of dengue fever and help in the reduction of mosquito
breeding.

Hundreds of people across north Queensland and the Torres Strait
have contracted Dengue Fever in recent months. 200 people have
been infected in the latest outbreak on Thursday Island, and now,
for the first time in 100 years, the 1st death has been reported
from the fever's complications.

But of greatest concern to health authorities are 3 cases of the
potentially fatal dengue haemorrhagic fever [DHF]. 2 women from
Yam Island in the Torres Strait survived their recent ordeal with
dengue haemorrhagic fever, but a female relative living on
Thursday Island died.

At present, the only method of preventing dengue is to control
mosquitoes carrying the virus, so extensive education campaigns
encourage north Queenslanders to get rid of containers of water
around their homes where mosquitos can breed.

In 2003 health authorities reported 7397 cases of dengue & 111 of
DHF. So far in 2004, there have been 3 more deaths.

In El Progreso, in the Sula valley [capital, San Pedro Sula], Jose
Lino Chong, chief of Health Area 2, said there were 2 deaths from
DHF there in 2003, and 25 cases of dengue were seen there in
January 2004, some of them suspected of being DHF.

In 2001 there was no dengue in the area, in 2002 there was one
case, but from Sep-Dec 2003 there were 1741 cases, including 16
with laboratory confirmation of DHF, one of them fatal, in a 12-year-
old boy.

[Since DHF usually occurs as a result of a 2nd infection with a
different serotype of dengue, the travel history of the 12-year-old
boy would be of interest. - Mod.JW]
