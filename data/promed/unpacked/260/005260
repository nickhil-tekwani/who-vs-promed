The Federal Ministry of Health in recent times has informed WHO of an outbreak of chikungunya that has affected eastern states. To date, a total of 13 430 suspected cases were reported from the country, primarily from Kassala and Red Sea state. Samples have been tested both by PCR and by serology. A number of samples have also been tested positive for dengue fever.

Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease. It can be easily be mistaken for other arboviral diseases such as dengue or Zika virus, since they share many clinical symptoms and are transmitted by a common vector, the _Aedes_ mosquito. Chikungunya is a self-limiting disease and has a low mortality rate. Treatment is mostly symptomatic. However, chronic, debilitating disease, such as prolonged joint pain, may occur in the aftermath of infections as a residual effect. Therefore, detection and diagnosis of chikungunya is challenging but critical at early stage of infection.

In the beginning, the current outbreak of chikungunya was concentrated in one state (Red Sea) of Sudan but has since spread to a 2nd state (Kassala), which is now worst affected amongst the 2 states. Kassala state has reported a majority of the infections (over 12 000 cases) so far, and cases continue to evolve (see the graph).

The fact that the current outbreak shows mixed infections of both chikungunya and dengue fever and the fact that often the clinical symptoms of both these infections overlap, it is critical to use a standardized and a more sensitive case definition for detecting all suspected cases which might otherwise remain unreported or undiagnosed. Although there is no specific treatment for chikungunya, standardized treatments need to be applied for dengue fever, as severe dengue fever cases may present with hemorrhagic manifestations as well as "shock syndrome," which might need treatment with blood platelets and fluid replacement therapy.

The Federal Ministry of Health is leading the response activities with the support from WHO and other partners. Owing to frequent population movement and also due to the fact that the vectors are established in Sudan (the country has reported repeated outbreaks from dengue in the past), there are heightened risks that the outbreak may also spread to other states.

The key public health measures that should be rapidly scaled up to contain the outbreak and stop the transmission include aggressive vector control such as emptying and cleaning water containers, limited but targeted spraying, and risk communication to reduce the risk of infection at the source. At the same time, surveillance systems should be enhanced throughout the country to early detect spread of the infection to other states.

[The above report indicates that this is a mixed dengue/chikungunya virus outbreak, although the proportion of each or the occurrence of dual infections are not mentioned.

Interestingly, a 28 Aug 2018 WHO report of an outbreak of febrile disease with some hemorrhage stated that there were 55 suspected virus hemorrhagic fever cases including 10 deaths (CFR 18.2 percent) reported since 24 Dec 2015. The most common case symptoms included unexplained bleeding (epistaxis), fever, fatigue, vomiting, and jaundice. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission. Mixed vector-borne viral hemorrhagic fever [VHF] was suspected. A total of 38 blood samples were initially obtained from suspected cases and shipped for testing. Test results (PCR, PRNT, ELISA) from WHO CC laboratories in Uganda (UVRI), South Africa (NICD) and Senegal (IPD) were negative for Ebola, Marburg, CCHF, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, Zika, West Nile, and Arenaviruses; 5 samples tested positive for o'nyong-nyong virus by PRNT; 3 samples were IgM positive for chikungunya; and one was IgM positive for dengue at NICD. (http://www.who.int/hac/crises/ssd/south-sudan-epi-28august2016.pdf?ua=1). There is no indication in the current report above of whether tests were done for o'nyong-nyong virus infections. The call for vigorous vector control measures and increased surveillance is prudent. - Mod.TY
