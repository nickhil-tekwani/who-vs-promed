Ebola virus disease outbreak -- Democratic Republic of the Congo
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Epidemiological situation
-------------------------
Between 2 and 9 Sep 2014, there have been 31 more cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), increasing the cumulative number of cases to 62 (14 confirmed, 26 probable, and 22 probable) [sic. "22 suspect"?]. In total, 35 deaths have been reported (9 confirmed and 26 probable). No deaths have been reported among suspected cases. 9 health care workers have been diagnosed with EVD, including 7 deaths. All the cases have been localized in Jeera county. The affected villages are Watsi Kengo, Lokolia, Boende, and Boende Muke. Currently, 9 cases have been hospitalized: 4 in Lokolia; 2 in Watsikengo; 2 in Boende; and 1 in Boende Moke. A total of 386 contacts have been listed and 239 contacts have been followed-up. All cases and contacts are linked to the initial index case reported to the World Health Organization on 26 Aug 2014.

Response activities
----------------
During a regional meeting between the Ministry of Health of DRC and the Southern African Development Community on the management and prevention of EVD transmission, the following measures were recommended: standardization of the interventions for the prevention of EVD and enhancement of sanitary border control without impeding international traffic.

Under the leadership of the Government, the international community is providing strong logistical support and sending experts, equipment, food, and transportation means to the field.

A team of national and international specialists have been deployed to work with the local response teams. Patients are being treated in temporary isolation units in Watsi Kengo, Lokolia, Boende, and Boende Muke. A mobile laboratory from the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) has been installed in Lokolia and is currently functional. Two laboratory epidemiologists from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have arrived in DRC to support the INRB field team.

Contact tracing activities are being carried out by an assigned team with supervision from of a medical epidemiologist and a community worker, and when required, psychologists visit and dialogue with communities. Ongoing sensitization activities to mobilize community leaders are being implemented.

Data reported in the Disease Outbreak News are based on official information reported by the Ministry of Health. These numbers are subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and availability of laboratory results.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD. (Contacts do not include properly-protected health-care workers and laboratory staff.)

[2] ECDC update
Date: Tue 9 Sep 2014

Ebola outbreak in DR Congo: A distinctly different event from the ongoing West Africa outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As of 4 Sep 2014, 72 cases including 48 deaths have been reported within an evolving outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Equateur province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), since the beginning of August 2014, states an ECDC rapid risk assessment issued today [9 Sep 2014].

The Ebola viral strain isolated from this outbreak is distinctly different from the strain isolated in the ongoing West Africa outbreak, and there is no epidemiological evidence linking the 2 events.

The epidemiological features of the DRC outbreak are consistent with previous outbreaks of Ebola virus disease in DRC, including in areas close to Equateur province.

The Equateur province is a remote area and not a tourist destination, hence it is unlikely that travellers from the EU will be exposed and become infected in the outbreak area. It is also unlikely that people residing in the outbreak area will travel to the EU while incubating the virus.

Intense media attention and professional communications to healthcare providers regarding the West African outbreak mean the EU public health community and health services are highly aware of and prepared for the possibility of patients presenting with Ebola virus disease in Europe.

ECDC is monitoring the development of this outbreak closely.

Outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Equateur province, Democratic Republic of the Congo -- 9 Sep 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Main conclusions
----------------
An outbreak of Ebola virus disease has been evolving in the Equateur province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) since the beginning of August 2014. As of 4 Sep 2014, 72 cases had been reported, including 48 deaths. The epidemiological features of this outbreak are consistent with previous outbreaks of Ebola virus disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus. The viral strain isolated from this outbreak is distinctly different from the strain isolated in the ongoing West Africa outbreak. There is no epidemiological evidence linking the 2 events.

As the incubation period can be up to 3 weeks, it is likely that additional cases will be identified in the affected zone during the coming weeks. However, control measures currently being implemented with the support of international partners are expected to prevent further spread of the disease. Given that the affected area is remote and not a tourist destination, it is unlikely that travellers from the EU will be exposed and become infected in the outbreak area. It is also unlikely that people residing in the outbreak area will travel to the EU while incubating the virus and develop the disease upon arrival. Risk mitigation measures for this outbreak are the same as for the ongoing outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa.

[3] MSF treatment centers
Date: Tue 9 Sep 2014
Source: Medecins Sans Frontieres [edited]
http://www.msf.org/article/drc-msf-opens-ebola-treatment-centres-lakolia-and-boende


Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has opened 2 treatment centers in response to the Ebola epidemic raging in Boende health zone, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The 1st is a 40-bed facility in Lokolia, the epicenter of the epidemic, and the 2nd is a 10-bed facility in Boende.

Logistical constraints and community education present the main challenges in the field. MSF now has nearly 40 staff members on site, divided between Boende and Lokolia, and has already sent 41 tons of supplies and equipment.

Community education
-------------------
Educating communities is critical to helping people understand how to prevent the disease and what to do in the event of a suspected case. "There are very few cases in Boende, so some people still think this is a fabrication and that Ebola does not exist," says Dr Papys Lame, a member of MSF's emergency pool in DRC. He arrived in the field when the warning was first sounded. "It's different in Lokolia. People have lost many friends and relatives. They know that the disease is there and they are more receptive to information. Some families have lost four or five people. One man lost his wife and then his sister-in-law. Next, one of his children became ill and died. The following day, another one of his children died."

MSF has opened a treatment center in Lokolia, where 6 patients are hospitalized; some are awaiting laboratory confirmation of a diagnosis. 2 patients are receiving treatment at the Boende facility. The education activities focus primarily on helping the community understand the importance of treatment.

Logistical challenges
---------------------
The 2 centers that have been established meet all standards intended to prevent transmission of the epidemic. "Setting up these centers was quite challenging, particularly in terms of transporting equipment and supplies," says Julien Binet, the project's logistics manager. "Once on site, you need time to plan everything out. After the center is operational, you can't make many changes, so preparation is critical."

Dr Lame emphasizes the challenges of working in the midst of an equatorial forest. "There are major logistical constraints," he says. "The road between Boende and Lokolia is pretty good. We transported several speedboats to use to cross the Lomela River. However, the road between Lokolia and Watsikengo is very bad. We managed to get the bridges repaired but the vehicles were still unable to cross. We had to be very creative. For now, we have 2 patients who are doing better. We think they have entered the convalescent phase. It's a glimmer of hope for the teams and the community."

[The WHO is reporting a total of 62 confirmed/probable/suspected EVD cases and 35 deaths as of 9 Sep 2014. This represents 3 more cases and 3 more deaths than our last update on 8 Sep 2014.

The ECDC summary presents slightly higher numbers in each category and the cause of the discrepancy is not clear. The ECDC summary notes distinct strain differences between the DRC Ebola strain and that from West Africa, but we have yet to see a published sequence from DRC, or details of the extent or nature of the differences. The source of this virological information is not clear to me and ProMED-mail would welcome authoritative information.

MSF has once again shown leadership in developing treatment centers and education activities in this remote region, despite major logistical challenges. - Mod.LM
