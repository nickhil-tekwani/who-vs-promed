53 people have received MMR [Measles, Mumps and Rubella] vaccinations
at Newcastle Emlyn Comprehensive School as investigations continue
into 15 cases of measles in Carmarthenshire and Cardiff. Hywel Dda
NHS Trust vaccinated 40 pupils and 13 staff who had not previously
received MMR injections. Trust staff were also able to identify a
number of other children who had already received the vaccination.

The National Public Health Service [NPHS] for Wales is continuing to
investigate the outbreak that has led to 13 cases of measles being
reported among staff and pupils at Newcastle Emlyn Comprehensive
School and 2 connected cases in Cardiff. A further probable case in a
child in Newcastle Emlyn is being investigated.

Dr Mac Walapu, Consultant in Communicable Disease Control for the
NPHS, said: "This vaccination session should substantially reduce the
risk of transmission of measles within the school. This is an
excellent example of the school, parents, NHS staff and partner
agencies responding positively to a challenge, and our thanks are due
to all of them. We are continuing to remind parents across Wales that
the only protection against measles is the MMR vaccination, and we
urge them to arrange for their children to receive the full 2-dose
course of the vaccination if they have not yet been immunized. Any
upsurge in measles cases is of concern to us, as this is a
potentially serious disease that can be fatal or can have permanent
consequences such as brain damage. Parents are reminded that if they
think their child may have measles, they must see their family GP for
diagnosis."

Measles is highly contagious and is generally spread from person to
person by coughs and sneezes. Early symptoms include a high
temperature, cough and conjunctivitis (painful, red eyes), and a red,
blotchy rash that appears approximately 3 days later, usually
beginning on the face and spreading down over the rest of the body.
Any child who develops symptoms of measles should not attend school
for 5 days after the start of the rash.

[The above report is another example of the consequence of incomplete
uptake of the triple MMR vaccine in the United Kingdom. Recently, the
Health Protection Agency (Report, Vol. 2, No. 25
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/archives/2008/news2508.htm> reported in an
update to the end of May 2008 that: "For the 4th consecutive month,
cases of confirmed measles in London continued to rise, exceeding the
peak observed in August 2007. In contrast, the number of cases in the
rest of England and Wales, which also increased in early 2008, has
remained steady during May 2008. The total number of confirmed
measles cases in England and Wales to the end of May 2008 was now 461.

The 1st death from acute measles infection since 2006 was reported. A
17-year-old with underlying congenital immunodeficiency was admitted
to hospital with respiratory distress and pneumonia on 20 Apr 2008
following contact with a case of measles. The patient deteriorated
and was transferred to ITU a week later with respiratory failure, but
subsequently died (5 weeks later). Serum samples and nasopharyngeal
aspirates taken at various times have confirmed that the patient had
infection with a strain identical to the measles strain
(MVs/Enfield.GBR/14.07 genotype D4) that has now been circulating in
the UK for over a year.

The majority of recent cases in London are linked to an outbreak in a
secondary school that has spread to neighboring schools and nurseries
and is the source for clusters in Cornwall and in South Yorkshire.
Due to almost 10 years of sub-optimal MMR vaccination coverage across
the UK, the number of children susceptible to measles is now
sufficient to support the continuous spread of measles. Health
services should exploit all possible opportunities to offer MMR
vaccine(s) to children of any age who have not received 2 doses.
Greater awareness of the increasing measles incidence by health
professionals and the public is essential to control the spread of infection."
