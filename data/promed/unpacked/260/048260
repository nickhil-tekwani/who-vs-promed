Jeddah: the novel coronavirus situation is reassuring and thankfully does not represent an epidemic - 9 Apr 2014

His excellency the minister of health Dr Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al-Rabiah, informs that the novel coronavirus [MERS-CoV ] situation is reassuring and that the number of cases in Jeddah is no different from the rest of the regions of the Kingdom.

He explained that the Ministry has noticed a limited increase in the number of cases of MERS-CoV during the past few weeks with the emergence of 11 cases in Jeddah, but the number of cases in general is still low and does not represent an epidemic according to World Health Organization standards and scientific committees.

The minister called on all citizens and residents not to be deceived by rumors or unreliable information in social and other media. Information from official sources, represented by the Ministry of Health or the Ministry's website or the Ministry spokesman will provide all information and developments in this regard.

The minister called on everyone to follow instructions issued by the Ministry and taking care to stay away from suspected cases, wearing a mask and washing hands when socializing with anyone with respiratory symptoms, and following tips published by the Ministry.

He concluded his address by saying that the MERS-CoV is still a mystery in the world and there is no confirmed information about modes of transmission. There is no vaccine or cure.

[According to the Saudi MOH website, there have been 179 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 67 deaths since the virus was first identified in 2012. This represents an increase of 4 cases since the last report yesterday, 7 Apr 2014. If this moderator's tally is correct, this will raise the global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to 223 cases including 90 deaths.

The newly reported cases in this update are from Riyadh, and not from Jeddah where there has been a barrage of media reports related to nosocomial transmission of the MERS-CoV (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (25): Saudi Arabia, UAE, RFI 20140408.2390003 for more details on the 11 cases recently reported in Jeddah).
