Beijing health authorities are telling the public not to panic
following the capital's 1st death this year [2010] caused by
hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD). An infant was the 1st fatality in
Beijing this year, reported Beijing Youth Daily.

The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Health said 582 HFMD cases were
reported last week [week of 5 Apr 2010], a 36.62 percent increase
from the week before last [week of 29 Mar 2010]. And the Ministry of
Health added on Tuesday [13 Apr 2010] that 94 people had died
nationwide of the disease, as of 11 Apr 2010.

But the bureau also pointed out that looking at the overall picture
was important. There were 2250 reported cases this year [2010] in
Beijing by Wednesday [13 Apr 2010], a drop of 15.54 percent from the
same period last year [2009].

"When we say there is no need to panic, it does not mean we should
not be cautious. HFMD is now approaching its peak infection rate,
which we predict will be between May and July," said Ma Yanming,
deputy director of the bureau. The health bureau launched a "2010
Beijing HFMD monitoring program" on Tuesday [13 Apr 2010] to tighten
prevention against the disease. Primary schools and kindergartens in
Beijing are being asked to be on the alert. The monitoring program
states that if a serious case or one that results in death appears in
any class, or 2 cases occur within one week in a single class, the
school should suspend classes for at least 10 days. "Morning
check-ups", which refer to a temperature test on children as they
enter school, have also been implemented by most kindergartens and
primary schools, Ma said.

Sterilization of toys, classrooms, and tableware are being emphasized
in kindergartens. "We understand parents' concerns, but there is no
need to worry," said Wang Yanli, school physician at Xiaoguanbeili
primary school in Chaoyang district. "Since cases of death are
usually caused by serious complications, such as encephalitis
(swelling of the brain), a good physical constitution and sound
immune system will serve as the best form of protection for children."

[Overall the 2010 outbreak of HFMD may be no worse than in the
previous year. It will be interesting to see if the measures to
control the outbreak at the level of entry of children to
kindergarten and primary schools will help to contain the spread of
infection. The "morning check-up" temperature screening is an
interesting innovation.
