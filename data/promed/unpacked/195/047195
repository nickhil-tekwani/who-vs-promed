[On 7 Oct 2001, ProMED-mail posted an article on a suspected case of
human rabies in Costa Rica -- see ref. above. In today's La Nacion, a
leading newspaper in San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica, there was an
article describing reaction to the occurrence of 2 cases of rabies in
humans in Costa Rica.
The 2 cases involved a 9-year-old boy and a 69-year-old woman who were
presumably infected by a cat in Ciudad Neily, south of San Jose. The
cases were not initially recognized as due to rabies. The last cases
of rabies in humans identified in Costa Rica were in 1970, with the
last documented outbreak (with 11 human deaths) occurring in 1968.
The article also describes as a primary fault the lack of
consideration of rabies as a diagnosis in animals, with a resultant
lack of attention to the need for post-exposure prophylaxis. A recent
example was an inability to get a cow's brain tested for rabies -- in
spite of the recent diagnosis of the 2 human cases.
The general sense is that there has been a feeling of complacency that
rabies had been eradicated in the country. The Ministry of Health and
the Social Security agency are about to embark on a campaign to
educate medical personnel not to rule out the possibility of rabies as
a diagnosis when there are compatible symptoms in a patient.
