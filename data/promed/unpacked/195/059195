Schistosomiasis is hyper-endemic in the d'Amoron'i Mania region, with
12 469 patients treated last year [2007] out of a population of about
25 000. The report indicates that neurological problems were common
and responded to treatment. In all, 1/3rd of the villages in the
region were considered hyper-endemic and received mass treatment.

The 2nd most affected district is Manandriana, with 3930 treated
cases, followed by Fandriana with 3892, Ambositra and
Ambatofinandrahana with 3758 and 1069 cases, but the numbers of
patients seeking treatment are increasing.

Local health authorities have intensified surveillance using
serological testing in the hyper-endemic area, followed by mass
treatment. Health authorities had a plan to reduce the number of
cases by 25 percent in 2006, but the target was not achieved, and the
prevalence of infection is again increasing.

[Infection with _Schistosoma_ is endemic in Madagascar. The present
increase in prevalence seems to be related to a failure of the
control program for the area, with the infection moving towards
pre-control levels. _Schistosoma mansoni_ and _S. haemoatorbium_ have
a complex life cycle involving a fresh water snail as intermediate
host but no animal reservoir. Eggs are excreted in the urine by
humans infected with _S. haematobium_ and in feces if infected by _S.
mansoni_. Lack of proper sanitary conditions and sewage handling,
lack of snail control, and insufficient diagnosis and treatment of
infected cases may all contribute to the emergence of the infection
following a failed control program. - Mod.EP]
