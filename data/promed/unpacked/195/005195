New scare as chicken disease prompts EU ban on exports
------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of a bird disease that can wipe out entire flocks was
confirmed by the Government last night [15 Jul 2005], fueling a new
scare in the countryside.
A case of Newcastle disease [NCD] in Surrey led to an immediate ban
on all exports of live birds, hatching eggs, meat and eggs outside
the European Union.
The disease is as damaging to the poultry industry as foot-and-mouth
is to livestock. It is almost always fatal to birds, and can cause
conjunctivitis in adults and children in contact with infected
animals.
The banned exports are worth GBP 114 million [appx USD 200 million] a
year, and mainly consist of the export of cheaper cuts such as
chicken, turkey and duck wings and feet to the Far East.
There was concern last night [15 Jul 2005] that the European
Commission might also decide to ban these exports to the continent.
This would be a blow to industry, because this EU market is worth
more than GBP 300 million [USD 525 million] a year.
It was also unclear whether the ban would affect ready meals and any
other food products that contain poultry, pheasant or egg.
A spokeswoman for the Food and Drink Federation said: "We are seeking
urgent clarification, but it may depend on the European Commission."
The flock of 9000 pheasants on a farm that rears game birds for
shooting near West Horsley and Reigate is to be slaughtered this
weekend in the 1st case in the country for 8 years.
Government vets imposed a one-mile exclusion zone around the infected
farm to halt spread of the disease.
The affected chicks are just 2 weeks old and were imported from
France 2 weeks ago. Debbie Reynolds, the Government's Chief
Veterinary Officer, is now urgently checking whether any other
consignments of pheasants are in Britain. The French immediately
stopped further exports of pheasants to Britain.
Vets are still investigating whether the chicks were infected when
they arrived in Britain or if they contracted the disease here. No
further details of the farm at the center of the alert were
disclosed. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs said the information was not appropriate at this stage.
Vets are also tracing the truck driver who imported the chicks to
find out where other infected birds may have been taken. There are no
chicken farms in the immediate vicinity, though one of the main
poultry production areas of England is in the adjacent county of Kent.
Although most breeding and egg-laying birds are routinely vaccinated
against the disease, most chickens reared for meat are not. Peter
Bradnock, chief executive of the British Poultry Council, said: "We
suspect the threat is confined to southern England, and farmers will
already be getting their birds vaccinated."
Vets are to start culling the birds today [16 Jul 2005]. A spokesman
for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs insisted
that the method would be humane. Ms. Reynolds insisted this was not
"avian flu."
Anyone who keeps poultry or game birds is being urged to arrange for
them to be vaccinated as soon as possible, because the virus can
spread virulently in wildlife.
It can affect turkeys, chickens, geese, ducks, pheasants, guinea fowl
and other wild and captive birds as well as ostriches, emus and rhea.
Farmers and gamekeepers are reminded that the disease is notifiable
and that they should look out for symptoms such as depression, lack
of appetite, breathing difficulties, coughing, sneezing and diarrhea.
It is spread mainly through the feces of infected birds or
contaminated feed, water, equipment, premises and even human clothing.
Newcastle disease was 1st known in Britain in the 1930s, and there
have been 7 outbreaks since then, the last in 1997. The most recent
outbreaks have been in California in 2003 and Denmark in 2002.

[There are ample examples, from various countries, of NCD being
introduced by imported live pheasants, one of the oldest records
relating to the 1st epizootic in Switzerland in 1942.
The incubation period for NCD after natural exposure varies from 2 to
15 days. Hence, the pheasant day-old-chicks could, theoretically and
practically, have arrived infected in the UK, manifesting clinical
signs a fortnight later.
It might have been tempting to attribute the outbreak to their
getting infected in France, but the British Veterinary Services have
opted to take a cautious approach, refraining from jumping to
conclusions before a thorough epidemiological investigation is
accomplished, in cooperation with their French
colleagues/counterparts. While doing so, they are applying the
necessary, prescribed measures to eradicate the outbreak and prevent
further spread, an exemplary approach which deserves appreciation.
Let us patiently wait for the results of the investigation, including
lab-backed data on the causal virus strain and its genetic
relationship to continental and wildlife strains. France's last
reported outbreak of NCD occurred in December 1999.
