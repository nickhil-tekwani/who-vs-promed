Kazakhstan quarantines 4 districts hit by anthrax epidemic
-----------------------------------------------------------

ALMA-ATA, August 10 (Itar-Tass) - Kazakhstan quarantined 4 areas where an
epidemic of anthrax broke out. Some 30 people have been hospitalized in the
past two weeks, the republic's emergencies agency told Itar-Tass on Thursday.
Agency personnel said special sanitary checkpoints reinforced by police
patrols control in- and outgoing traffic in the dangerous area. However,
medics acknowledge low effectiveness of these preventive measures because
cattle breeders and sellers do not ship meat through main roads. The number
of people complaining of anthrax symptoms in the area has been growing,
medics said.

[To have 30 people hospitalized would suggest that some 300 livestock had
been butchered. The second paragraph would indicate a large "informal"
market in inadequately inspected meat. -Mod.MHJ
