New Human Coronavirus Identified
--------------------------------
Dutch scientists have announced they had identified a previously unknown
coronavirus that causes respiratory disease and is likely to have spread
around the world. The virus is only the 4th coronavirus to be found in
nearly 4 decades and could explain many cases of respiratory illness that
leave doctors baffled. Named HCoV-NL63, the virus causes symptoms similar
to a bad cold and does not unleash the pneumonia characterised by severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, which killed some 800 people
and infected 8000 in the 2002-03 epidemic. Young children and people whose
immune system has been compromised by HIV or other diseases are more at
risk although not apparently fatally so.
In a study published online by the journal Nature Medicine [see reference
below], the University of Amsterdam team report on their detective work,
launched after a 7-month-old girl was to admitted to their hospital in
April 2003 with bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the lower airways. Tests
for common cold viruses, influenza virus, and other well-known
[respiratory] viruses all proved negative.
"At first, we were worried that the child may have caught the virus from an
animal because she had been to the zoo the previous weekend," said the
research supervisor, Ben Berkhout, an expert in human retrovirology. [Then
using RT-PCR screening the Dutch team obtained a couple of fragments that
looked like coronavirus genome fragments but not identical to one of the
known human coronaviruses]. Closer examination of its genetic code showed
it shares about 2/3 of its nucleotides with the 3 established coronavirus
human coronaviruses. In other words, it was an independent member of the
coronavirus family that had never been spotted before.
The team then tested stored samples taken from other admissions and found
that another 7 patients with respiratory problems -- 7 percent of
admissions -- had been infected by the same virus. 4 of the 7 were children
less than 12 months old and 3 were adults. 2 of the adults had an impaired
immune system -- one had had a bone-marrow transplant and the other had AIDS.
These findings suggested that: "This novel coronavirus is already
widespread in the population," said Lia van der Hoek. "It is causing
perhaps the symptoms of common colds, but in the younger individuals it is
causing more severe respiratory problems," Mr Berkhout said. "About 20 to
50 percent of respiratory problems do not have a [known] viral cause, so we
now can fill in a significant fraction of those unknowns." Dr Berkhout
admitted it was "surprising" that this virus had never been found before,
but part of the problem was the lack of tools to detect new agents easily.
In general, coronaviruses are usually transmitted by airborne droplets
breathed in from someone in proximity who, for instance, sneezes or coughs.

[The paper referred to in this report is published in the current online
edition of Nature Medicine: "Identification of a new human coronavirus, by
Lia van der Hoek, Krzysztof Pyrc, Maarten F Jebbink, Wilma Vermeulen-Oost,
Ron J M Berkhout, Katja C Wolthers, Pauline M E Wertheim-van Dillen, Jos
Kaandorp, Joke Spaargaren, Ben Berkhout University of Amsterdam."
The unexpected identification by virologists in Amsterdam of a novel human
coronavirus predominantly associated with relatively mild upper respiratory
tract disease and more specific lower respiratory tract disease
(bronchiolitis) in infants comes not long after the equally surprising
identification of another novel global human respiratory pathogen (human
metapneumovirus) by virologists in Rotterdam, and is another remarkable
"first" for Dutch virologists. The new coronavirus has been designated
HCoV-NL63 and is clearly different from the 3 known human coronavirus
species -- _Human coronavirus 229E_, _Humman coronavirus OC43_, and the
_SARS coronavirus_. These human coronaviruses (together with other
mammalian coronaviruses) belong to 3 phylogenetically distinct clusters of
species within the genus _Coronavirus_ of the family _Coronaviridae_. The
precise evolutionary relationship of this new human coronavirus to the
established members of the family has yet to be determined. - Mod.CP]
