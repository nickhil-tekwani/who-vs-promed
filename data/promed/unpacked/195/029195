Foot and mouth disease strikes fear in breeders
------------------------------------------------
Livestock breeders here are worried because foot and mouth disease
(FMD) has resurfaced and killed more than 20 cattle in the past 2
months. In January 2009, 15 cases were reported in Panching while
another 13 cows died of FMD in Kampung Paya Pinang here last month.

"For the 1st time, my cattle have died of the disease," said Wan
Lijah Wan Said, 65, who has been rearing cattle in Kampung Paya
Pinang for 30 years. After the animals were infected, Wan Lijah said,
they became too weak to eat or drink. She lost 10 cows to the disease
in just 4 days. "Their saliva stinks and their feet are covered with
ulcers," she said, adding that efforts by the Veterinary Services
Department to save the animals had failed.

Her neighbour, Hawa Yunus, 59, said she also faced the same problem.
She said many breeders did not inform the authorities about the
disease as they wanted to sell their sick animals. "These
irresponsible breeders are the main culprits that have made it
difficult to control the disease."

State Veterinary Services Department director Datuk Dr. Azhar Idris
confirmed that more than 20 cattle had died of FMD in the past 2 months.

FMD, serotypes O and A, is endemic in Peninsular Malaysia; most of
the cases are caused by serotype O. The island states of Sabah and
Sarawak are FMD-free.

Official confirmation of the above reported outbreaks and details of
the serotype(s) involved are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
