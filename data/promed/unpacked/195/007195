[2] Dengue virus in blood donors
Date: Fri 19 Jun 2015
Source: Healio, Infectious Disease News [edited]
http://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/emerging-diseases/news/online/%7Bd35ece09-2400-430e-a32f-ab720e736f6e%7D/denv-in-endemic-regions-spreading-through-blood-transfusions


DENV in endemic regions spreading through blood transfusions
------------------------------------------------------------
The report is taken from
Sabino EC, et al: J Infect Dis. 2015;doi:10.1093/infdis/jiv326.
Levi JE. J Infect Dis. 2015;doi:10.1093/infdis/jiv322.

Transmissions of dengue virus through blood transfusions may be ongoing in endemic regions of the world during epidemic periods, according to recent findings.

"This is the largest study of [transfusion transmission (TT)] dengue to date," the researchers wrote. "Our findings confirm that during seasonal epidemics substantial proportions of asymptomatic donors with infection are donating blood and recipients are receiving RNA-positive blood components."

In the linked donor-recipient study, researchers evaluated 39 134 blood donors recruited from Brazilian blood centers at a general hospital and a cardiovascular hospital. From February to June 2012, researchers collected extra plasma from each donor and identified the recipients of this blood daily. Recipients gave blood samples between 3 and 21 days after transfusion, and pretransfusion recipient blood also was retrieved and frozen. Transcription-mediated amplification was used to retrospectively test the samples for dengue virus (DENV). Chart reviews were conducted to evaluate patient symptoms. Recipients were classified as cases or controls, based on RNA positivity for DENV or if they had received transfusions from donors positive for DENV RNA.

The researchers found that DENV-4 viremia was detected in 0.51 per cent of the donor samples from Rio de Janeiro and 0.8 per cent of those from Recife. There were 6536 blood components transfused to 657 enrolled recipients from whom a post-transfusion sample could be obtained. Of these, 0.64 per cent donation units transfused to 34 recipients were DENV RNA-positive.

16 of the RNA-positive units transfused to 16 recipients were valid for estimating the TT rate. [of these,] 10 cases were considered nontransmissions, 5 were probable TT, and one was possible TT. An estimated TT rate of 37.5 per cent (95 per cent CI, 15.2-64.6 per cent) was determined, and this rate was greater than the 0.93 per cent (95 per cent CI, 0.11-3.34 per cent) viremia rate in nonexposed recipients (P less than .0001). Chart review revealed no significant differences in symptoms or mortality between cases vs. controls.

According to the researchers, during peak epidemic periods, roughly 1-2 per cent of blood donations may be RNA-positive for dengue.

In a related editorial, Jose Eduardo Levi, PhD, of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil, described potential countermeasures to the spread of dengue through transfusion.

"Emerging and re-emerging viruses continue to threaten the blood supply," Levi wrote. "Clearly, the current approach of 'a new test for each new agent' results in increasing the already high cost and complexity of blood screening. [However,] 2 extremely promising alternatives for this dilemma are methods that would inactivate all virus nucleic acids in blood and unbiased sequencing of donor cell-free plasma nucleic acids, revealing the whole human genome in addition to the microbial diversity."

[These reports raise serious concerns about safety of the blood supply in areas of the world where dengue virus is endemic. Potentially, thousands of asymptomatic blood donors may be involved each year. The cost of additional screening tests and procedures would place additional financial strain on health services, especially in developing countries.
