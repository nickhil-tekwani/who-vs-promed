Persistent red tide causes massive fish kill, lingers in Gulf and Lower
Laguna Madre
-----------------------------------------------
Thousands of dead fish recently lined Boca Chica Beach from the mouth of
the Rio Grande to the jetties some 7 miles to the north. Texas Parks and
Wildlife biologists estimate that more than 100 000 fish perished because
of the persistent red tide that has lingered along the lower Texas coast
for 3 weeks.
Red tide is a naturally occurring, higher-than-normal concentration of the
microscopic algae, _Karenia brevis_. The organism produces a toxin that
affects the central nervous system of fish and paralyzes them causing them
to be unable to breathe. Red tide derives its name from the brownish red
sheen prolific blooms color the water.
More than a dozen red tides have occurred along Texas beaches in the past
70 years, and the majority have been in the past 2 decades. This most
recent outbreak in South Texas was 1st detected at Boca Chica several weeks
ago, when approximately 39 000 small forage fish, primarily Gulf menhaden,
washed up on the shoreline.
However, as Texas Parks and Wildlife technician Billy Euler examined the
kill at Boca Chica, he noticed a startling difference from the initial fish
mortalities.
"We are still seeing a lot of menhaden, mullet and scaled sardines, but now
we are starting to see some bigger fish: redfish, trout, flounder, snook
and even a few red snapper."
While game fish such as trout and redfish were scattered throughout the
mass of dead fish, the most alarming causalities were dozens of large
snook, many in the 30-inch-plus category.
Gulf menhaden made up the majority of the kill, as 31 000 were estimated to
have died along with 26 000 scaled sardines, 26 000 mullet and 9000 hard
head catfish. Very few red fish washed up, but there were more than 1000
trout counted and some 700 snook.
Snook have been rebounding along the lower Texas coast, and there is
concern over finding so many dead. This is believed to be peak spawning
time for snook along the surf zone, and that may help account for the
number of mature fish that died. Virtually all snook greater than 30 inches
in length are females, and many that perished represented prime brood fish.
Patchy areas of red tide have also entered the Lower Laguna Madre and been
detected along the beach and offshore as far north as the Port Mansfield
jetties. There also has been a significant fish kill reported on the beach
near the Port Mansfield jetties.
"Some of the water samples that were recently analyzed from the bay showed
cell counts that were about twice the level of what they were last week
[final week September 2004], more than 2500 cells per milliliter," said
Randy Blankinship, Lower Laguna Madre ecosystem leader for the Texas Parks
and Wildlife. "That is definitely strong enough to kill fish."
Blankinship added that the current concentration of red tide remains well
below cell counts from the extensive bloom along the lower coast a decade ago.
"Back in 1996, we saw blooms that had counts as high as 35 000 cells per
milliliter," he said.
Although extensive fish kills have not occurred along the beaches of the
town of South Padre Island, many beach goers have suffered from respiratory
problems, coughing, sneezing and itchy eyes. The bloom releases an
irritating aerosol when concentrated in rough surf, and that bothers many
people, particularly those with asthma.
"We have had some very heavy aerosol," said Cameron County Marine Extension
agent Tony Reisinger. "As a matter of fact, it was so thick on the 22nd [22
Sep 2005] that we could actually taste the brevetoxin. It had a chemical
taste to it when we were very close to the surf. Surfers were reporting
nausea, and some of them had to leave the water."
Fresh-caught fish, crabs and shrimp in red tide waters are safe to eat, but
oysters should be avoided.
"The health department has issued a closure for the harvest of oysters,
clams and mollusks for the Lower Laguna Madre," Blankinship said.
Oysters and other shellfish can accumulate red tide toxins in their
tissues. People that eat them may become seriously ill with neurotoxic
shellfish poisoning. Once a red tide appears to be over, toxins can remain
in the oysters for many weeks. The Texas Department of Health will closely
monitor the current bloom before reopening the season for oyster and
shellfish harvesting.
Scientists do not fully understand what causes red tides to proliferate,
but they know they have been around for a long time.
"The earliest reports that we know of were when Spanish explorers were
crossing the Gulf in 1530; they noted water discoloration, and they
experienced the aerosol effects of red tide," said Reisinger.
Red tide always is believed to be present offshore, and currents are
thought to play a crucial role in transporting it to coastal waters where
it may intensify. Florida and Texas seem particularly susceptible to bouts
of the toxic bloom.
"This is a naturally occurring organism that is always out there, and when
conditions are right, it does proliferate," said Reisinger.
"We do not know exactly what kicks it off," Blankinship noted. "We know it
is related to light intensity, temperature, salinity and the presence of
nutrients that fuel the plant's growth." He explained that Texas Parks and
Wildlife is currently engaged in a cooperative study with the University of
Texas at Port Aransas to study the causes of the red tide and what might be
learned to mitigate its impact on coastal fisheries.
Over the past few decades, harmful algal blooms have increased throughout
the world's coastal waters. In the United States, only a few regions were
previously affected, but now virtually every coastal state has reported
major blooms.
A number of factors are thought to be possible causes for this trend,
including both natural dispersal and human-related phenomena, such as
enhanced nutrient loading associated with coastal development, global
climate change and species introductions via ship's ballast water.
Texas' 1st recorded red tide occurred in 1935 and affected waters from Port
Aransas to Mexico. It was 20 years before the next episode at Galveston and
nearly another 2 decades before a bloom was reported off Brownsville. In
1986, a red tide bloom killed an estimated 22 million fish from Galveston
to the Rio Grande, and then a series of blooms occurred in 1987, 1990-91,
1993-97 and 2000.
"It is difficult to say what this current bloom is going to do,"
Blankinship said. "Some of our previous blooms have percolated along at a
relatively low level for quite a while and then suddenly started blooming
more heavily, usually when conditions got very calm and still and hot, much
like we are experiencing now. Then we had more intense blooms; in some
cases, we had massive fish kills, but once the fronts came through, it
started to dissipate."
