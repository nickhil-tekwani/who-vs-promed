11 people in southern Tajikistan have been hospitalized with suspected anthrax
----------------------------------------------------------------------
According to the Veterinary Service of the Ministry of Agriculture of
Tajikistan, an outbreak was registered in the village Maydapata in
Farkhor district of Khatlon oblast (200 km [124 mi] south of
Dushanbe). Of the hospitalized [presumably human - Mod.MHJ] cases 4
have been confirmed as [cutaneous] anthrax.

Up to 150 000 people live in the Farkhor district, according to
unofficial data.

"Currently a team of veterinarians is working in the area," the
Veterinary Service announced. Anthrax was diagnosed in 30 cows, out
of the 300 under observation.

[Tajikistan is a scattered country with a challenged infrastructure
and not unlike more advanced countries what they report is frequently
limited by what the diagnostic laboratories receive. Thus a blood
swab from a dead sheep gets reported as "one ovine outbreak with one
case" as no other information was supplied with the sample. The
reality? Who knows? Anyone visiting the OIE WAHID website will see
this repeated for country after country. So while the Tajik numbers
of bovine and small ruminant outbreaks indicate sporadicity, for
example there were only 10 livestock outbreaks reported to OIE for
2008, the human case numbers indicate a more severe problem though
recently the numbers have halved indicating a possible improvement;
that is, 2000 (338 human cases); 2001 (157); 2002 (163); 2003 (126);
2004 (113); 2005 (50); 2006 (33); 2007 (45); 2008 (45).
