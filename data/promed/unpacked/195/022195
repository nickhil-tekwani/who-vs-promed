An outbreak of hemorrhagic fever with nephritic syndrome in the Orenburg
region of Russia [north of Volgograd] has resulted in 1 death and "tens of
others" hospitalized. The most serious focus of the outbreak has been in
Kuvandyk district, with more than 160 persons infected, 22 of which are
children and adolescents.
The fever is caused by a [hanta]virus carried by [wild] rodents which
invade homes and hide in foodstuffs and kitchen crockery. Epidemiologists
in the country have been recording an "unprecedented" and "massive" spread
of mice, as climatic conditions favoring their propagation prevailed in the
region.
A medical emergency zone has been declared for Kuvandyk town and the entire
region as health and epidemiology centers pursue a program of rodent control.
[HFRS is caused by Hantaan virus and has a case fatality rate of around 7%
in China and Korea, where it causes more than 100 000 cases a year. The
disease in Russia and Europe, where it is known as nephropathia epidemica,
is generally milder, and is caused by Puumala virus, a different hantavirus
with a different species of wild rodent as reservoir. Which virus is
responsible for the Kuvandyk outbreak will, hopefully, be known after lab
tests are completed - Mod.JW]
