The National Zoonosis Director, Ministry of Health, Freddy Lison,
reported the detection of a new [to the region] human disease which is
transmitted by the dog to sheep and goats called 'hydatid cyst'.

The high number of cases with liver problems reported at the hospital
in Tupiza, Potosi Department, led the authorities to discover a new
zoonotic disease in that region but they do not discard its presence
in other areas of the country.

Lison explained that the disease is spread from dog feces that
contaminate sheep and goat feed, and in turn, [the hydatid cyst] is
passed to humans through the consumption of the viscera of these
animals. The parasite lodges in the liver and lungs of man to complete
the damaging process.

He noted that the disease was discovered thanks to the intervention of
physicians from Uruguay who, with the help of portable ultrasound
equipment, tested 400 people, of which 17 were positive. Samples of
dog feces was also investigated with the copro-antigen test, which
resulted positive, proving that dogs transmit the disease to sheep and
goats and then to humans."

Hepatic hydatid cyst is a relatively common disease in Bolivia, which
may be associated with pulmonary cysts and, less frequently, in
kidneys, bones, brain, muscles, spleen, eyes, etc. Its symptoms are
comparable to slow-growing tumors and depends on the location and size
of hydatid cyst. Diagnosis is usually made incidentally during imaging
tests.

Given the seriousness of the situation, another ultrasound machine
will be acquired with assistance of the Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO), to carry out tests in the entire country.

Lison reported that Health Minister Nila Heredia will travel today [24
Sep 2010] to the southern region of the country to develop actions to
try to prevent the spread of the disease.

[In South America, _Echinococcus granulosus_ occurs in most countries,
but highest prevalences are observed in parts of Argentina, Bolivia,
Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay where the parasite causes significant
public health problems (WHO/OIE Manual on Echinococcosis in Humans and
Animals: a Public Health Problem of Global Concern from 2001;
<http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2001/929044522X.pdf>).

It is unclear what "attack rate" means in the article above. They
mention that 400 ultrasounds were done, of which 17 were positive for
hydatid disease -- what is not clear is whether the denominator (400)
was in theoretically healthy individuals or in individuals with
hepatic cystic disease. If the former, then they have documented a
baseline rate of approximately 4 per hundred... (4 percent) of the
population -- a rather high figure.

Another interesting point is whether it is _E. granulosus_ or _E.
vogeli_, which has been described in humans in South America
(D'Alessandro A and Rausch RL: New Aspects of Neotropical Polycystic
(_Echinococcus vogeli_) and Unicystic (_Echinococcus oligarthrus_)
Echinococcosis. Clin Microbiol Rev 2008; 21(2): 380-401;
<http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/21/2/380>).

It is probably not true that humans are infected by consuming raw meat
with _Echinococcus_ cysts as stated in the article. Rather, humans
like other mammals, are infected by eggs shed into the environment by
infected dogs and other canines. - Mods.EP/MPP]

[Other sources say that 204 people were tested and 19 were positive,
most with hepatic cysts. 180 dogs were tested and 37 were found to be
carriers of the disease, see

welcome.
