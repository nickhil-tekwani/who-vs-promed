Turtles and other reptiles are reservoirs of _Salmonella_ and have
long been a recognized source of salmonellosis in humans (1). Small
turtles have posed a particular danger to young children because
these turtles might not be perceived as health hazards and can be
handled like toys. Salmonellosis in children can be severe and can
result in hospitalization and occasionally in death (2). The
association between _Salmonella_ infection in children and exposure
to turtles led to a 1975 law prohibiting the sale or distribution of
small turtles (i.e., those with a carapace of less than 4 inches in
length) in the USA (3). That prohibition led to a substantial decline
in human salmonellosis cases associated with turtles (4). However,
because the prohibition is not fully enforced and contains exceptions
(e.g., sales for educational purposes), human turtle-associated cases
continue to occur. This report describes several recent cases of
turtle-associated salmonellosis reported to CDC by state and local
health departments since September 2006, including a fatal case in an
infant. These cases illustrate that small turtles remain a source of
human _Salmonella_ infections. Although ongoing public education
measures aimed at preventing reptile-acquired salmonellosis are
helpful, prohibiting the sale of small turtles likely remains the
most effective public health action to prevent turtle-associated salmonellosis.
_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Pomona Infections - Multiple States
-----------------------------------------------
On 20 Feb 2007, a female infant aged 3 weeks with a one day history
of poor feeding and lethargy was evaluated in an emergency department
at a Florida hospital. The patient was transferred immediately to a
tertiary care pediatric hospital; on arrival, she was febrile and in
septic shock. Antibiotics were administered. She died on 1 Mar 2007.
Cultures of cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples yielded
_Salmonella_ serotype Pomona.
The parents of the patient were interviewed by the Florida Department
of Health. A family friend had purchased a small turtle with a
carapace of 1.25 inches from a flea market in north central Florida
in mid-November 2006. The turtle was purchased as a pet and given to
the patient's family in late January 2007. After the death of the
infant, laboratory testing of the turtle and its environment was
performed by the Florida Bureau of Laboratories. A fecal sample from
the turtle yielded _S._ Pomona. The _S._ Pomona isolates from the
patient and the turtle were indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE).
A total of 19 other _S._ Pomona isolates from 19 patients in 11
states (Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada,
New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Texas) with a
PFGE pattern closely related to the isolate from the Florida patient
and turtle were submitted to PulseNet (National Molecular Subtyping
Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance), with isolation dates
ranging from 2 Oct 2006 to 23 Apr 2007. To determine whether these
cases of _S._ Pomona infection were associated with turtle exposure,
CDC staff coordinated an investigation with state and city health
departments, which conducted interviews with patients or their
parents or guardians. The median age of patients was 3 years (range:
2 months-59 years). Illness onsets occurred during 30 Sep 2006-23 Apr
2007. Of the 15 interviewed patients, 12 (80 percent) had direct or
indirect contact with a turtle within 7 days before illness onset.
Among those 12 patients, 9 (75 percent) had turtles as household
pets. The duration of turtle ownership before illness onset ranged
from less than one month to approximately 5 years. Among the 6
patients for whom purchase information was available, all had
purchased small turtles as pets from flea markets or pet shops.
Carapace size at time of purchase was not reported. No common vendor
was identified.
Salmonella I 4,[5],12:i:- Infections - Ohio and Tennessee
-----------------------------------------------
Ohio: In September 2006, a previously healthy boy aged 8 years had
onset of bloody diarrhea with cramping, headache, vomiting, and fever
of 101.0 F (38.3 C). The Ohio Department of Health Laboratory
isolated _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- from a stool specimen. The
patient recovered at home after 3 days. No family member reported a
similar illness while the patient was ill. However, the next month,
the patient's brother, aged 12 years, had onset of bloody diarrhea; a
stool specimen yielded Salmonella I 4,[5],12:i:-.
Two weeks before the 1st patient became ill, the family had purchased
3 red-eared slider turtles as pets, each with a carapace of less than
4 inches, at a flea market in southeastern Kentucky. The Ohio
Department of Agriculture Laboratory isolated _Salmonella_ from the
coelomic contents of the turtles and a water sample from the turtles'
aquarium. The isolates were serotyped at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory; the turtle
isolates were _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:-, _S._ Litchfield, and _S._
Infantis, and the water sample isolate was _S._ Infantis. The
_Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- isolates from the patients and turtles
were indistinguishable by PFGE performed at the Ohio Department of
Health Laboratory.
Tennessee: In September 2006, a previously healthy woman aged 45
years was hospitalized with diarrhea, chills, fever of 102.8 F (39.3
C), abdominal cramps, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting of 24
hours' duration. The patient was treated with antibiotics and
intravenous fluids and released after 3 days. A stool specimen
yielded _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:-. The patient became ill less than
2 weeks after her son, aged 7 years, received 2 small red-eared
slider turtles, both with carapaces of less than 2 inches, as a gift
from family friends who had purchased them in Florida from an unknown
vendor. The child also had onset of diarrhea shortly after receiving
the turtles, but no specimens were collected during his illness.
County health officials visited the patient's home and collected a
stool specimen from the child, an external surface swab from both
turtles, and a water sample from the aquarium. Specimens from the
child and turtles yielded _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- isolates, which
were indistinguishable from the mother's isolate based on PFGE
performed at the Tennessee Department of Health Laboratory. The
aquarium water sample yielded _S._ Pomona.

MMWR Editorial Note:
Salmonellosis remains a major public health problem in the USA, with
an estimated 1.4 million nontyphoidal human infections occurring
annually, resulting in approximately 15 000 hospitalizations and 400
deaths (5). Reptiles are a well-established source of human
salmonellosis; a study conducted during 1996-1997 attributed an
estimated 6 percent of all human, laboratory-confirmed, sporadic
salmonellosis in the USA (and 11 percent of infections among persons
aged less than 21 years) to contact with reptiles and amphibians (6).
The epidemiologic and laboratory findings from the investigations
described in this report demonstrate that turtles were the likely
source of infection in these human salmonellosis cases. Exposure to
turtles was associated with salmonellosis, and identical PFGE strains
were isolated from samples from patients and their turtles in 3
separate instances. Nontyphoidal human salmonellosis in the USA is
common and usually sporadic; therefore, many cases of
turtle-associated human salmonellosis likely occur without detection
or without a recognized link to exposure to turtles.
Despite a federal law prohibiting the sale or distribution of small
turtles as pets, such sales still occur. Salmonella can be
transmitted to humans by direct or indirect contact with a turtle or
its feces. No reliable methods are available to guarantee that a
turtle is free of the organism. Most turtles are colonized with
_Salmonella_ and shed the bacteria intermittently in their feces.
Certain techniques to eliminate _Salmonella_ from turtles have been
unsuccessful and have resulted in _Salmonella_ isolates with
increased antibiotic resistance (7). In addition, turtles not
shedding _Salmonella_ species under normal circumstances have been
shown to actively shed the bacteria when stressed (8). Moreover,
water in turtle bowls or aquariums can amplify any _Salmonella_ shed
by turtles. For these reasons, all turtles, regardless of carapace
size, should be handled as though they are infected.
In 1980, CDC estimated that the 1975 federal prohibition of the sale
of small turtles in the United States had prevented an estimated 100
000 cases of turtle-associated salmonellosis in children aged 1-9
years in 1976 (4). These additional cases might have resulted in
approximately 1500 hospitalizations and 40 deaths that year (4-6).
Reductions in human illnesses associated with turtle-associated
_Salmonella_ strains were observed in other countries when similar
small turtle sale prohibitions were enacted (9,10). When Sweden
joined the European Union in 1996 and sale prohibitions were
repealed, the number of human salmonellosis cases from
reptile-associated _Salmonella_ strains increased substantially, with
children being most affected (9).
The recent cases of turtle-associated human salmonellosis described
in this report emphasize the need for improved prevention measures.
Public education aimed at preventing reptile-acquired _Salmonella_
infections is ongoing in the United States. After identification of
the cluster of _S._ Pomona infections and the fatal case in the
infant described in this report, the FDA issued a consumer advisory
update, available at
<http://www.fda.gov/consumer/updates/turtles042307.html>, emphasizing
the risks for salmonellosis associated with small pet turtles.
Consumers were reminded of recommendations for reducing the risk for
Salmonella infection from all reptiles, which include washing hands
with soap and water after handling reptiles or their cages and
keeping reptiles out of food-preparation areas. CDC has published
similar recommendations, available
at <http://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/spotlight_an_turtles.htm>. Such
education measures are helpful, but prohibiting the sale of small
turtles likely remains the most effective public health action to
prevent turtle-associated salmonellosis.

[This CDC posting is one related to the legal principle of _res ipso
liquitor_, that is, the thing speaks for itself. Clearly, turtles
cannot be considered _Salmonella_-free and should not be brought in
as pets. Since, however, truth has a half-life of no more than 6
months, additional periodic reminders are needed. - Mod.LL]
