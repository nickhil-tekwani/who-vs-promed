Pet owners have been warned to keep their dogs away from the lake at Calderstones Park following the discovery of toxic algae. Blue-green algae, which is potentially poisonous, has been detected in the water at the South Liverpool park. The council is warning people and pets to stay away and has imposed a ban on fishing.

A notice states: "Please keep off the lake. Be advised that you must avoid any contact with the water, and do not allow pets to drink from the lake. The Environment Agency have informed us that a water sample taken from Calderstones Park Lake for analysis has confirmed the presence of a bloom of the potentially toxic blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) in the water. Liverpool City Council apologizes for any inconvenience; however, as blue-green algae can cause a health risk, we have no other recourse than to stop all activity on the lake including fishing until otherwise advised."

Toxin-producing blooms can kill domestic pets as well as wild animals and farm livestock. If people swallow any water infected with blue-green algae, it can cause rashes and illness including eye irritation, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever and muscle and joint pain.

Lib Dem leader Cllr Richard Kemp has also issued a warning over the matter. He tweeted: "If you go to Calderstones Park stay away from the lake. There is an outbreak of blue-green algae which is [harmful] to people and pets." A Liverpool charity for blind and visually impaired men and women is also warning owners to keep their dogs away from harmful water.

Guide Dogs, based in Knotty Ash, is warning their clients about the toxic algae and its potential health risks to dogs. Engagement officer Penny Williams, said: "Our clients especially need to be informed about the potentially life threatening toxic algae. There is a sign in the park, but visually impaired men and women will struggle to see this, so it's very important they get to know so they can keep their dogs away from the water."

A spokesperson for the council said: "There was a routine test by the environment agency which found blue algae. As a precaution, we have advised people to stay away, and no fishing is allowed. We are monitoring the situation."

[There are a number of very toxic blue-green algae or cyanobacteria. The toxin may be present even if the algae are not, and likewise the algae may be present but the toxin may not be. However, safety for humans and animals means avoiding bodies of water with any blue-green algae.

Athletes and many non-athletic swimmers will ingest some water despite their best efforts to avoid it. However, just swimming in water that looks like pea-green soup does not sound appealing or healthy.

"There are a number of blue-green algae, many of which are toxic, frequently resulting in rapid death for animals. Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are a group of photosynthetic bacteria that many people refer to as "pond scum." Blue-green algae are most often blue-green in color, but can also be blue, green, reddish-purple, or brown. Blue-green algae generally grow in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams when the water is warm and enriched with nutrients like phosphorus or nitrogen.

When environmental conditions are just right, blue-green algae can grow very quickly. Most species are buoyant and will float to the surface, where they form scum layers or floating mats. When this happens, we call this a "blue-green algae bloom." Blue-green algae blooms generally occur between mid-June and late September, although in rare instances, blooms have been observed in winter, even under the ice.

Many different species of blue-green algae occur, but the most commonly detected include _Anabaena_ sp, _Aphanizomenon_ sp, _Microcystis_ sp, and _Planktothrix_ sp. It is not always the same species that blooms in a given water body, and the dominant species can change over the course of the season.

Blue-green algal toxins are naturally produced chemical compounds that sometimes are produced inside the cells of certain species of blue-green algae. These chemicals are not produced all of the time, and there is no easy way to tell when blue-green algae are producing them and when they are not. When the cells are broken open, the toxins may be released. Sometimes this occurs when the cells die off naturally and they break open as they sink and decay in a lake or pond. Cells may also be broken open when the water is treated with chemicals meant to kill algae, and when cells are swallowed and mixed with digestive acids in the stomachs of people or animals.

Typical clinical signs in dogs exposed to blue-green algae include seizures, vomiting, and/or diarrhea after contact with surface water. Although the water appears clear, if a "bloom" is just starting, it may be difficult to see any sheen, an early indication of blue-green algae formation. Some forms of blue-green algae may start forming slightly below the surface, and may not be visible, but are just as toxic.

One toxic alga frequently involved in illness and deaths is _Microcystis aeruginosa_, a single-celled blue green alga, or cyanobacterium, that occurs naturally in surface waters. Microcystis can proliferate to form dense blooms and mats under certain conditions. Many variants of these cyanobacteria produce multiple toxins, including the potent liver toxin microcystin. When microcystis die, their cells break open, releasing the toxin microcystin into the water. Ingestion of water or algal cells containing microcystin has produced adverse effects in fish, dogs, cats, livestock, and humans. Sometimes the mats and the sheen of the organisms are visible on the surface of the water, if it is a pond. In larger bodies of water, such as large lakes, it may be more difficult or impossible to see the sheen or the mat of accumulation.

People swimming in dense microcystis blooms have experienced irritation such as skin rashes, burns, and blistering of the mouth. Ingestion or inhalation of water containing dense bloom material may cause vomiting, nausea, headaches, diarrhea, pneumonia, and fever. Ingestion of significant levels of the toxin microcystin can cause liver damage and dysfunction in humans and animals. No deaths from ingestion of microcystins have been reported in humans in the US; however, Brazil has reported human deaths. Dogs, wildlife, and livestock have died following exposure to this toxin.

Microcystis blooms typically thrive in warm, turbid, and slow-moving waters. The blooms with the highest biomass occur in waters that are high in nitrogen or phosphorus (eutrophic waters). Microcystis also requires sufficient light intensity to conduct photosynthesis, which results in blooms.

The commonest route of exposure to microcystin is drinking water, followed by recreational exposures and food supplements. Typical water treatment processes do not fully remove microcystin that might be present in drinking water supplies stored in reservoirs. Swimming and playing in water that contains, or recently contained, microcystis blooms is another common exposure route. Children have the highest risk of exposure since they tend to unintentionally ingest water while swimming. Microcystin can move through the aquatic food web, exposing fish and shellfish, as well as the people who consume them. Microcystin does not remain in edible fish and shellfish tissues for more than a few weeks. However, people who frequently consume sport fish caught from a water body that supports microcystis blooms have a higher risk of exposure. Dogs can ingest large amounts of microcystis cells when they clean their coats after playing in water. Livestock, wildlife, and dogs are exposed through drinking water containing microcystis or through ingesting algal mats.
