Ebola Virus Antibody Detected in Kenyan Monkeys
-----------------------------------------------
NAIROBI: Barely a fortnight after medical authorities ruled out the
presence of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Kenya, scientists now say the
country is home to primates carrying the Ebola virus. Dr. Walter Ochieng, a
scientist working with the Centre for Viral Research at the Kenya Medical
Research Institute (KEMRI), has said that [signs of Ebola virus were
recently [detected in some monkeys in the Kakamega and Mount Elgon forests
of western Kenya. Ochieng told the Kenya Medical Association Annual
Conference that virologists at KEMRI had stumbled on antibodies in [random
samples collected from monkeys in the 2 forests.
More research should be done on the subject, Ochieng said, though he was
"unhappy" that, despite the availability of competent researchers, vital
scientific studies were hampered by lack of funds. Though researchers have
yet to establish how animal viral diseases like Ebola spread to humans,
Ochieng said effective preventive and curative measures would be put in
place only when the mode of transmission was discovered.
A fortnight ago a female recruit at the Kenya Police Academy at Nyeri in
central Kenya succumbed to a high fever, headache, and bleeding through all
body openings, symptoms of Ebola [and other hemorrhagic fevers. Her death,
and the hospitalization of another recruit at the same academy exhibiting
similar symptoms, sent shock-waves throughout the country as medical
specialists grappled with the problem. Health authorities later ruled out
Ebola hemorrhagic fever as the cause of death, explaining that [the female
patient had died from a blood disorder-related ailment, while the other
trainee had been diagnosed as suffering from typhoid fever. In late 2000,
an Ebola outbreak in neighboring Uganda caused panic and forced Kenyan
authorities to send screening teams to all border posts between the 2
countries. A number of Kenyans who attended funerals of their relatives in
Uganda were quarantined for over a week at Busia border point.

[Ebola virus is a negative-stranded RNA virus classified together with
Marburg virus in the family _Filoviridae_. All known filoviruses appear to
be highly pathogenic for non-human primates. Outbreaks of filovirus disease
have occurred in Europe and North America in monkeys imported from Africa
and the Philippines, sometimes with spread of infection to humans. Contact
with the tissues of dead non-human primates was a source of infection for
humans on at least 2 occasions in Africa.
Nevertheless, the lethality of the viruses for non-human primates suggests
that, like humans, non-human primates are incidental victims of infection
and are not true reservoir hosts. The source of filoviruses in nature
remains unknown, but in some instances, bats roosted in buildings or a cave
visited or frequented by people who subsequently were found to have primary
cases of infection in outbreaks of disease in Africa; one patient was
bitten or stung by what is presumed to have been an arthropod 7 days before
coming down with Marburg disease. For further discussion of this subject

Diseases, vol. 2, no. 2, Oct-Dec, 1996
