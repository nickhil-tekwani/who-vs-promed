EVA outbreak in New Mexico wrapup
---------------------------------
An outbreak of equine viral arteritis (EVA) occurred on a Quarter
Horse breeding farm in New Mexico in June 2006 and the ensuing
dissemination of infection to farms both within and outside the state
raises significant issues and conclusions. These issues include the
management and veterinary procedures employed by the Quarter Horse
industry to maximize reproductive performance by extensive use of
artificial insemination and embryo transfer, which contributed to the
spread of EVA.
When an infectious disease outbreak occurs, it is imperative that a
prompt and accurate diagnosis is obtained. Preventive measures can
then be immediately implemented to restrict the spread of infection
and mitigate serious disease and economic losses.
Accepting that EVA has now become established within the Quarter
Horse population, it will be necessary to introduce a preventive
program of vaccination accompanied by appropriate monitoring to
determine the extent of this infection within the population.
In early June, the farm owner, a veterinarian, became concerned that
mares previously identified as pregnant were, upon re-examination,
found to be "empty". By 16 Jun 2006, the increasing number of losses
prompted the owner to seek advice as to the possible cause.
Sera and semen samples were submitted to the Maxwell H Gluck Equine
Research Center at the University of Kentucky. The Gluck Center made
the recommendation, which was accepted, that shipment of semen from
stallions on the farm be halted. On 23 Jun 2006, results revealed
very high antibody titers to equine arteritis virus in the majority
of the sera, and by 26 Jun, the virus had been isolated from the
semen of 2 stallions. These findings provided very strong
circumstantial evidence of recent exposure to the virus, which was
later confirmed by examination of paired sera from individual animals.
The owner promptly informed clients that had recently received semen
from the infected stallions as well as those who had moved the many
donor and recipient mares on and off the farm. The state veterinarian
for New Mexico was informed, and the farm was placed under
quarantine, prohibiting movement of animals. Following extensive
communication and submission of numerous samples to the Gluck Center
by farms that had recently received semen or mares from the index
farm, it was confirmed that equine arteritis virus infection had
become widely disseminated to farms both within the state and in 6
other states.
With considerable historical information provided by the index farm,
it was determined that infection was most likely introduced in late
May 2006, with 4 stallions becoming infected in early June, 3 of
which began to "shed" virus in their semen.
Serological examination of over 200 animals on the farm confirmed an
extremely high prevalence of infection, with every mare, foal, and
stallion on the farm found seropositive. One third of the yearling
colts were also positive, with the yearling fillies being
serologically negative.
Despite the high level of exposure, the reported clinical signs were
minimal. A few animals were reported to have fevers, dependent limb
edema, and mild respiratory signs, with the majority of animals
experiencing sub-clinical infection. However, the number of pregnant
mares losing their pregnancies during early gestation was very high.
The initial spread of infection was considered to have been through
aerosol transmission from direct contact with animals in the acute
stage of infection. This transmission was compounded by the high
concentration of animals on the premise. Secondarily, it was thought
to be spread by venereal transmission once stallions became semen
"shedders" and carriers of equine arteritis virus.
Vaccination of non-exposed yearlings using the modified live vaccine
ARVAC (Fort Dodge Animal Health) was undertaken on the farm, and
other animals considered at risk on other farms involved in the
disease occurrence also were vaccinated. Because of previous low
demand, limited supplies of vaccine were available within the United
States, and these supplies were quickly used up, creating an
immediate lack of vaccine availability. The supplier, Fort Dodge, has
undertaken to manufacture a large batch of vaccine, which was
scheduled to be available in October, in time to initiate a
vaccination program prior to the onset of the 2007 breeding season.
Over the last 2 years, there has been increasing evidence of equine
arteritis virus infection within the Quarter Horse population when
compared to the results of the National Animal Health Monitoring
Survey (NAHMS) published in 1998. That survey indicated that the
prevalence of infection within the breed was as low as 0.5 percent.
At a meeting of Quarter Horse breeders, owners, trainers, and
veterinarians held at Ruidoso Downs in New Mexico on 17 Aug 2006,
coinciding with the annual sales, the feasibility of embarking on a
vaccination program of stallions and possibly mares was addressed.
Currently this proposal is under consideration. If there is agreement
on a policy of vaccination, this policy will need to be implemented
prior to the commencement of the 2007 breeding season.

[Equine viral arteritis (EVA) is a contagious viral disease of equids
caused by equine arteritis virus (EAV), an RNA virus that is
classified in the family Arteriviridae. The virus is found in horse
populations in many countries worldwide. EVA is included in the List
B of the OIE, which are diseases of economic significance which
should be reported annually from endemic countries, or as an
emergency notification when recognized for the first time in a
country; such is the current case in Argentina. The disease has been
reported to the OIE, in the past, from Europe, Africa, North America,
Australia and New Zealand, but not (yet?) from Asia and South
America. EVA cannot be differentiated clinically from a number of
other respiratory and systemic equine diseases. While
laboratory-confirmed outbreaks of EVA have been infrequently reported
in the past, the incidence of the disease appears to be on the
increase.
Although many cases of EAV infection are subclinical, certain virus
strains can cause disease of varying severity characterized
principally by fever, depression, anorexia, dependent oedema,
especially of the limbs, scrotum and prepuce in the stallion,
conjunctivitis, an urticarial-type skin reaction, abortion and,
rarely, a fulminating pneumonia or pneumo-enteritis in young foals.
Apart from mortality in young foals, the case-fatality rate in
outbreaks of EVA is very low. Affected horses almost invariably make
complete clinical recoveries. A long-term carrier state can occur in
a high percentage of infected stallions, but not in mares or
nonbreeding horses.
There is considerable evidence that short- and long-term carrier
stallions shed EAV constantly in the semen but not in respiratory
secretions or urine. International movements of horses, as well as
their semen, is liable to testing and certification which are
specified in chapter 2.5.10.1 of the International Animal Health Code
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/A_00085.htm>. According to OIE's
Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines, stallions
should first be serologically tested. Virus isolation should be
attempted from the semen of stallions that are positive for
antibodies to EVA and that do not have a satisfactory history of
vaccination against EVA. - Mod.AS
The 2 most important routes of transmission of the virus are
respiratory via the acutely infected horse and venereal via the acute
or chronically infected stallion. Aerosol transmission is the
principal means of spread of infection among horses closely
congregated such as at racetracks, shows, and sales. Venereal
transmission by an infected stallion is frequently responsible for
dissemination of the virus on breeding farms. Indirect spread of the
virus through contact with contaminated fomites (such as shanks,
twitches, apparel, and personnel) is of minor significance during
outbreaks. Congenital infection of foals due to exposure of mares
late in gestation has been infrequently recorded.
A significant percentage of stallions become carriers after exposure
to the virus. These stallions transmit the virus venereally and play
a major role in maintaining infection in horse populations from year
to year. Attempts to establish the carrier state in mares, geldings,
and sexually immature colts have been unsuccessful.
No specific antiviral treatment is available. Symptomatic treatment
(antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and diuretics) is indicated. Good
nursing and rest with a gradual return to normal activity are
desirable. There is no known medical means of eliminating the carrier
state in the stallion.
EVA can be prevented and controlled by sound management practices and
selective use of a commercial, modified live virus vaccine. While the
vaccine is both safe and immunogenic for stallions and non-pregnant
mares, it is not recommended for use in pregnant mares, or in foals
less than 6 weeks old.
Prevention and control programs are aimed at curtailing dissemination
of the infection. This minimizes the risk of virus-related abortions
and helps prevent development of the carrier state in stallions. -
