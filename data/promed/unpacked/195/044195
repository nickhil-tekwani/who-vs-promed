In your report of 23 Jan 2010, you incorrectly report the presence of
enzootic bovine leukosis in the United Kingdom.

I wish to clarify that, in the case you report, serological screening
carried out on young cattle by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency
gave positive results. These tests, along with others carried out in
a subsequent investigation of these animals did not reveal the
presence of active infection. Positive results were only obtained
using serological tests for antibody. We conclude that the animals in
question acquired antibody passively, after being fed a colostrum
substitute imported from Canada. To stress, there is no evidence of
active infection with EBL virus in these or any other cattle in Great
Britain. For further information on this case, please see Lysons
(2010) Vet Rec. Jan 16; 166 (3): 88. [See item 2].

We would like to report on the findings of our investigations of a
number of cases where feeding young calves a colostrum substitute
imported from Canada resulted in positive enzootic bovine leukosis
(EBL) serology results in these animals.

Bovine leukosis virus (BLV) is the cause of EBL in cattle. EBL is a
notifiable disease, and the UK is currently classified as officially
EBL-free by the European Union.

Routine serological screening of calves on 3 different UK farms,
destined for artificial insemination centres or export, revealed the
presence of antibodies to BLV. Our investigations indicated that
these antibodies were not the result of infection with BLV but that
they were passively acquired from an imported colostrum substitute
with the trade name Calf's Choice Total, which has been marketed in
the UK as a supplementary source of colostrum for neonatal calves.
Calf's Choice Total is manufactured in Canada (where EBL is endemic)
by the Saskatoon Colostrum Company and is distributed in the UK by
Alta UK. An information sheet provided with the product states that
it is made from natural bovine colostrum and contains antibodies to a
wide variety of common infectious organisms, including BLV. The
information sheet also states that calves fed the product on day one
of age may show a positive result if their blood is tested for these
antibodies.

We have not identified any direct animal health risk associated with
the use of this product. The product has been imported using a health
certificate under the Animal By-Products Regulations, which requires
the colostrum to be heat treated in a way that will readily
inactivate BLV. There is no evidence that the product contains viable
BLV, and therefore our current investigations indicate there is not
an infection risk. However, the use of this product, or equivalent
products from countries where EBL is endemic, does have implications
for surveillance for EBL and for individual farms, because any
positive result to a serological test for EBL triggers disease
control restrictions and investigations under the relevant
legislation. Thorough investigation of herd status in these cases is
essential to allow us to continue to demonstrate national freedom
from EBL. Although every effort is taken to ensure that disease
control restrictions are proportionate, they are likely to prove !
inconvenient for affected premises, with the possibility of
consequential financial loss. Initially, the whole herd will be
placed under movement restrictions, although this may subsequently be
reduced to the epidemiological groups containing the seropositive
animals. Such restrictions may however continue for several months
while antibody levels are monitored.

We request that colleagues in cattle practice bring this matter to
the attention of their clients, particularly those clients producing
calves likely to be subjected to routine serological screening for
EBL, such as calves destined for an artificial insemination centre or export.

This posting raises a number of questions.
- At what age were the calves tested? Has it been confirmed that they
have picked up infection or could it be passive immunity (from the
colostrums substitute) [as apparent from the above items 1 and 2, the
latter, namely passive immunity, is the correct one. - Mod.AS].
- If the colostrum substitute has been confirmed to be the source,
what measures have been applied to stop further spread?
- What are the demands on herds/cows that deliver milk for the
production of Calf's Choice? Are they tested free from EBL, or are
other measures applied to inactivate any live viruses in the product?
- How does the producer respond? Do they have an explanation on how
this could happen?

[Several of Prof Lindberg's queries, sent to ProMED-mail before the
receipt of item 1 from the VLA, are addressed in Dr Lysson's letter
to the Vet Rec (item 2). We are grateful to Dr Drew, VLA, for drawing
our attention to the said letter and are particularly indebted for
his firsthand information, which has allowed us herewith to clarify
that the case should not be regarded as an EBL outbreak but as
detection of BLV antibodies.

The whole scenario and the sanitary and trade implications of the
laboratory test results upon the involved farms are adequately
explained in the Vet Rec letter. It will be interesting to note if
the product involved or other colostrum-derived preparations from
EBL-infected countries have been certified for use in other EU-member
countries declared free of EBL.

The distributor included in its web-page
<http://www.altagenetics.com/UK/CCT/> the following relevant comment:
"The bottom line: nothing beats feeding good quality maternal
colostrum, but in cases where quality is poor or unknown, or if
there's a disease issue (i.e.: Staph. aureus, Johne's, BLV, or
Leptospira), then use Rite Start Complete" (see Colostrum FAQ PDF at Q&A).

Subscribers are referred to the VLA web-page addressing EBL at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/vla/diseases/dis_ebl.htm>, where Q8. "How is
the disease confirmed?", says: "

Laboratory tests on blood, milk and tissues are required to confirm
the disease. Most commonly, diagnosis is based on serology, by
looking for antibody to the virus in the blood of the animal.
Antibodies can be detected 3-16 weeks after infection. Tests include
agar gel immunodiffusion test (AGIDT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Calves under 6
months can be serologically positive due to persistence of maternal
antibodies." - Mod.AS]
