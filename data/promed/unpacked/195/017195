[In view of the continued spread of ASF in Southern Russia and
conflicting media reports about the ASF situation in the Caucasus,
where the epizootic started in 2007, we obtained the following update
on the situation in Georgia and Armenia from a reliable source. - Mod.AS]

African swine fever: update on the situation in Georgia and Armenia
--------------------------------------------
Georgia:

The last official case (not internationally reported) occurred on 11
Mar 2008 in backyard pigs in the village Lelian (Tianeti district;
North to Tbilisi).

During 2008, 16 outbreaks were identified, many of them through
clinical symptoms only. During 2009 (till 24 Mar 2009), 37 suspected
cases were investigated, but all were lab negative.

According to the official data, 4 percent of the Georgian pig
population died because of the infection (drop from about 517 700 to
497 000 animals, thus more than 20 000 head died because of the
infection). Stamping out has not really been applied due to the
absence of compensation and personnel. Eventually, no stamping out of
animals has been registered. (In Georgia, there are less than 2
public vets per region). These are estimates, and it is not known
which statistical techniques have been applied to obtain them.

Armenia:

The last case in domestic pigs was reported on 5 May 2008 in the
village Arcvanik, province Kapan, region Syunik.

The last case in wild boars was reported on 5 Jun 2008 in the
Shikahog Natural Preserve (relatively close to the Iranian border).

Analyzing the National Compensation data base, the following
information could be obtained in reference to domestic pigs:

During 2007, 111 outbreaks were reported from 7 regions, where 5975
pigs were reportedly infected and 12 501 culled.

During 2008, 29 outbreaks were reported from 8 regions, with 225 dead
animals and 518 culled individuals.

According to MoA official data, the Armenian pig population decreased
by about 45 percent from 156 000 (2006) to 86 500 (1 Jan 2008), and
it reached the lowest size compared to the previous 5 years.

Backyard pigs still constitute, at present, the backbone structure of
the pig sector in Armenia. About 80 percent of the pigs are in
backyards, with an average number of 70 pigs/village.

[OIE's summary of Armenia's 6 reports on ASF, including a map, is
available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6051>.

On 26 Feb 2008, Armenia submitted a final report declaring that the
disease had resolved on 30 Dec 2007. However, as indicated in the
above report, an outbreak occurred on 5 May 2008 in the village of
Arcvanik. In its annual report for 2008, no ASF outbreaks are
reported; this is in contrast to the above information on 29
outbreaks in 8 regions during 2008. This discrepancy is in need of
clarification.

There is also disagreement between the quantitative information from
Georgia, included in the above report, and the media. For example,
the Russian "Last24.info" reported on 21 Jan 2009 that the number of
domestic pigs killed by ASF in Georgia had reached 65 000 (see
<http://last24.info/read/2009/01/20/5/4098>, in Russian).

Firsthand, official updates from both countries will be a good
service to transparency.

Upon the invitation of the Georgian government, acting in line with a
recommendation of a joint FAO/EC/OIE (UN Food and Agriculture
Organization/European Commission/World Organization for Animal
Health) assessment mission in June 2007, an assistance mission from
SDC (Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation) took place between
1-14 Jul 2007 in Georgia (see 20070920.3131).

The following recommendations were made to the government of Georgia:

- to establish a national task force for the strategic lead of the
ASF control plan;
- to establish geographically "disease-free zones" (short term),
enlargement of these disease-free zones by strict control measures in
the intermediate zones (mid term), and to eradicate ASF from Georgia
(long term);
- to prohibit free-roaming pigs and to confine pigs;
- to restrict the movement of pig products (fresh pork and meat
products) in infected zones and intermediate zones;
- to compensate for killed pigs, but with a defined system;
- to implement a system of disease investigation and epidemio-surveillance;
- to improve the national communication strategy;
- to engage veterinarians in the border inspection service;
- to improve waste management.

The complete [SDC] mission report can be downloaded at
<http://www.safoso.ch/activities/ongoing_activities/index.html>.

What should worry neighboring countries and, apparently, also Europe
is the fact that the disease continues its spread. A follow-up of the
implementation of the above recommendations in Georgia, as well as
application of similar measures in the other territories that have
become infected since 2007 -- particularly south Russian provinces --
deserve to be prioritized. - Mod.AS]
