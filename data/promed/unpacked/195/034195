Warning over eating unopened ackees
-----------------------------------
The Ministry of Health is warning members of the public against eating
unfit and unopened ackees. The Ministry's surveillance unit has detected 35
cases of ackee poisoning from 1 Dec 2010 to 12 Jan 2011

Minister Rudyard Spencer has ordered the Outbreak Response Team to improve
both public education and the capacity of the surveillance system at the
Ministry's head office. Spencer said that special attention should be paid
to ensure that householders use only fit and well opened ackees.

Ackees should also be properly cleaned by removing the seed and the pink or
reddish membrane, then washed before cooking to prevent possible poisoning
especially because of the high levels of toxins that may be contained in
the unripe fruit. Ackees should be cooked by themselves while other foods,
including salted fish, should be cooked separately.

"It cannot be said too often that ackee should be allowed to open naturally
and fully on the tree before it is picked and eaten or sold. They should
not be opened by force, or by using a knife or any other implement. The
water that is used to boil the ackee should be discarded immediately and
should not be ingested or reused for cooking other foods such as ground
provisions and rice," said Spencer.

If not properly ripened, ackee contains high levels of a toxin called
hypoglycin which can potentially lead to death if consumed. Symptoms of
ackee poisoning include vomiting, stomach cramps/abdominal pain, dizziness,
diarrhoea and sweating. If persons are experiencing these symptoms they
should seek medical attention immediately and should have a sweet drink
while on their way to the health centre or hospital.

All incidents of ackee poisoning have been from ackees cooked at home.
There has been no incident involving tinned ackees. For more information
members of the public may contact the Ministry of Health or their nearest
health centre.

[Improperly prepared ackee fruit (_Blighia sapida_), almost a staple in
Jamaica, is responsible for an illness known as "Jamaican vomiting
sickness" or "Jamaican vomiting sickness syndrome" and either term is known
as JVS. The name is indicative of what a victim experiences, severe
vomiting and profound hypoglycemia.

The ackee fruit is one that becomes edible when it is ripe and bursts open
revealing its seeds. The yellowish aril, the fleshy part surrounding the
black seeds is the edible portion. At the time of ripeness or harvest the
fruit is a brilliant red or red-orange color. In order to consume the
fruit, there must be no red in the meat of the fruit to be consumed. The
red peel contains high levels of hypoglycin A and hypoglycin B.

Fatalities have resulted from improper preparation and consumption of this
fruit. Fatalities are believed to occur more often in those who forcibly
open the fruit before it is fully ripe, have included some of the outer
covering of the fruit, are malnourished, or used the water from the cooked
fruit for some other consumption purposes.

Two toxic water-soluble substances can be extracted from the fruit. The 1st
toxin, hypoglycin A, is L-(alpha)-amino-(beta) -[methylene
cyclopropyl]propionic acid. Hypoglycin B is a (gamma) -L-glutamyl
derivative of hypoglycin A and is less toxic than hypoglycin A. Hypoglycin
A, but not hypoglycin B, can be found in the aril of the fruit. The unripe
fruit has a much higher concentration of hypoglycin A (approximately 20
times) than that of the ripe aril. Both components are found in the seeds.
Therefore, the seeds and the membrane at the base of the seed mantle are
always poisonous.

Hypoglycin A, which is now simply called hypoglycin, is metabolized by
means of transamination and oxidative decarboxylation to methylene
cyclopropyl acetic acid (MCPA). MCPA forms nonmetabolizable carnitine and
coenzyme A (CoA) esters, thereby depressing tissue levels of these
cofactors and making them less available for other biochemical reactions.
Hypoglycemia results because both CoA and carnitine are necessary cofactors
for long-chain fatty acid oxidation and because oxidation is a requisite
for active gluconeogenesis.

MCPA also inhibits the dehydrogenation of several acyl-CoA dehydrogenases,
including butyryl CoA, glutaryl CoA, and isovaleryl CoA. As a result of the
inhibition of butyryl CoA dehydrogenase, the oxidation of long-chain fatty
acids stops at the level of hexanoyl CoA and butyryl CoA. This effect leads
to the decreased production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and
acetyl CoA.

Because NADH and acetyl CoA are required as a cofactor of
3-phosphoglyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase and as an activator of
pyruvate carboxylase, respectively, their diminished concentration
contributes to the inhibition of gluconeogenesis. The inhibition of
glutaryl CoA dehydrogenase results in the accumulation of glutaryl CoA,
which could inhibit transmitochondrial malate transport, a rate-limiting
step in the early phase of gluconeogenesis, and consequently suppress
gluconeogenesis. Altered levels of circulating insulin do not cause
hypoglycemia associated with hypoglycin action.

Jamaican vomiting sickness is characterized by a sudden onset of vomiting
that is preceded by generalized epigastric discomfort starting 2-6 hours
after the ingestion of a meal containing ackee. Once the sickness begins,
symptom progression is rapid. Patients experience pronounced sweating,
tachypnea, tachycardia, headache, and generalized weakness. After a period
of prostration, which may last as long as 18 hours, a 2nd bout of vomiting
may occur. Unless treatment is given, this episode is usually followed by
convulsions, coma, and death.

Tonic-clonic convulsions occur in 25 per cent of the patients. Seizures
occur in 85 per cent of all fatal cases. Fatty degeneration of the liver
similar to Reye syndrome also occurs. The average time to death is 12.5
hours. Symptoms of the disease do not include fever or diarrhea.

Treatment may need to be aggressive depending upon the degree of
dehydration, hypoglycemia, delirium, and seizures present.
