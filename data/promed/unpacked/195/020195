Stump Acres Dairy has stopped giving away raw milk after some
customers became sick and were diagnosed with salmonella this month
[July 2007]. This marks the 3rd time in 2007 that the North Codorus
Township dairy has stopped selling or giving away raw milk because of
customers becoming ill.
Consumers who got raw milk from the dairy in July 2007 experienced
gastrointestinal illness and have been diagnosed with salmonella,
according to a news release from the Pennsylvania Department of
Agriculture and the Pennsylvania Department of Health. A recent
laboratory test result confirmed the presence of _Salmonella_ in raw
milk at the dairy, the news release states.
The Department of Health is advising customers to discard any raw
milk or any products made with the raw milk that came from the dairy.
The agriculture and health departments have asked the dairy to halt
sales of the raw milk, the news release states. Raw milk is milk that
has not been pasteurized or homogenized.
Terry Stump, the son of the dairy owner, said Stump Acres hasn't sold
raw milk for about 2 months. However, the dairy has given it away to
people who ask for it. "We will not be giving it away," Stump said.
"Nobody wants to see anybody getting sick." He said the dairy plans
to sell some cows to see whether that helps with the problem.

[The serotype of the organism is not reported, but serotype
Typhimurium had previously been associated with milk from this dairy

This paragraph is adapted from ProMED-mail post E. coli O157,
unpasteurized milk, 2005 - USA (WA) 20070302.0741:
"Raw milk is a well-documented cause of enteric infections and was
1st recognized as such about 100 years ago. Pathogens that infect
humans, including _Salmonella_, are shed in the feces of cows and can
contaminate milk during the milking process. Using standard hygiene
practices during milking (such as washing hands, keeping equipment
clean, and keeping the milking area separated from other areas) can
reduce but not eliminate the risk for milk contamination.
Pasteurization decreases the number of pathogenic organisms, prevents
transmission of pathogens, and has been determined to improve the
safety of raw milk more than other measure, including certification
of raw milk. Because raw milk certification has failed to prevent
many raw milk-associated infections in the past, consumers should not
assume that certified raw milk is free of pathogens. To prevent
salmonella and other infections, consumers should not drink raw milk."
This statement is true whether the consumer has purchased the
product, been given it free or partially owns the cow.
Among the pathogens contaminating unpasteurized (or raw) milk are:
Zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_,
_Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria
monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species,
_Coxiella burnetii_, _E. coli_ O157:H7 and even the rabies virus;
Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_
Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ species,
_Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from
_Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A.
People who consume unpasteurized milk and milk products might believe
that these products taste better, provide greater nutrition than
pasteurized products, and/or decrease the risk for various medical
conditions (1), but the benefits of consuming unpasteurized milk and
milk products have never been validated scientifically (2).
Just as it is with the transfusion of human blood, ingestion of
unpasteurized milk is a hazard that can result in illness severe
enough to be fatal.
