An Illinois health spokesperson told The Packer [newspaper] today that
fresh produce was the likely culprit sickening at least 71 people with
_Salmonella_ who ate at Subway Restaurants in 22 different counties.
But no one's really talking. That Spongebob cone of silence is working
a lot better for the produce industry than it is for BP [British
Petroleum, a reference to the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico].

As of this morning, there were 71 confirmed cases of _Salmonella_
serotype Hvittingfoss affecting people from 2 to 88 years old. Melaney
Arnold, communications manager for the Illinois Department of Public
Health told The Packer 26 people have been hospitalized, and 7 were
still in the hospital as of today.

Subway restaurants in 22 Illinois counties removed lettuce, green
peppers, red onions and tomatoes from restaurants during the period in
which people who got sick reported eating at a Subway -- 11 May to 25
May 2010, according to the department -- and replaced them with new
product, according to a Subway news release.

[The news release above states vaguely that "fresh produce was the
likely culprit" for this outbreak due to _Salmonella_, serotype
Hvittingfoss, but fails to detail what these products were or what the
evidence was on which this was based (e.g., items eaten by infected
versus uninfected people or growth of _Salmonella_, serotype
Hvittingfoss, from suspected food items).

According to the prior ProMED post (archive no. 20100609.1932), the
restaurant chain had removed the salad vegetables mentioned from the
restaurants early on, presumably having guessed these food items may
have been the sources. The news release above confirms that the total
number of cases increased from the previously reported 60 to 71.
