WHO response
-------------
Following the confirmation of new cases and deaths in new areas in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, WHO and its partners continue to provide the necessary technical expertise to the Ministries of Health to stop community and health facility transmission of the virus. A high-level WHO mission was conducted in Guinea to assess the overall response to EVD and propose a strategic approach to control the outbreak. Among other actions, this includes high-level advocacy with the governments of the 3 affected countries to enhance coordination and communication at all national, provincial, and district levels.

WHO is also closely supporting the Ministries of Health in addressing community resistance that is emerging in some areas; deploying additional experts in the various specialties (epidemiology, social mobilization, case management, and logistics among others); and enhancing cross-border collaboration. The next cross-border meeting between the 3 countries is planned for 23 Jun 2014.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.

This update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office.

[The fact that so many of the contacts have completed their 21-day observation period without falling ill indicates that their contact was not close enough to be dangerous. After this epidemic has ended, it would be important for future reference to test a sample of known contacts for evidence of sub-clinical infection and gather epidemiological information on the details of their contact. - Mod.JW]

The Health Officer of Lofa County, Dr. Aaron Kollie, has reported a fresh outbreak of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Foya district in northern Lofa County. Dr. Kollie told reporters in a telephone interview from Voinjama Monday [16 Jun 2014] that 3 new cases of EVD were recorded in Foya district over the past few days. He said one of the 3 cases has been confirmed, while the other 2, which have been classified as suspected cases, are undergoing laboratory tests.

Dr. Kollie pointed out that the 2 suspected cases have been quarantined under the watchful eyes of health practitioners of Foya district, while the positive EVD patient is on supportive treatment at the Burma Health Center in Foya. He attributed the fresh outbreak of the EVD in the county to cross-border movements between Liberia and Sierra Leone, where there is presently an outbreak of the virus, as well as Guinea, from where the earlier cases are reported to have emanated.

According to Director Esiah, 6 cases have been confirmed to be EVD, while the remaining 3 are all suspected cases awaiting laboratory confirmation. The dead victim, a 45-year-old [woman] is said to have traveled from Sierra Leone to seek treatment at the Tellewoyan Memorial Hospital in Voinjama City, where she subsequently died. The other victims have been quarantined.

[Yet another cross-border transmission; this epidemic is extremely difficult to contain given free cross-border movement, which is impractical to try to stop. - Mod.JW]

[4] Sierra Leone: Kailahun

Health and Sanitation Minister Miatta Kargbo has described the outbreak of the killer Ebola virus disease (EVD) as another war that calls for the attention of every Sierra Leonean including Parliamentarians. Presenting the current status of the outbreak in the Well of Parliament, Madam Kargbo reiterated the commitment of the government and partners to contain the disease, describing the situation as a natural war that needs the moral support and responsibility of all well-meaning citizens of Sierra Leone.

The number of cases tested since March 2014 was slated at 193, confirmed cases 83, 20 deaths [CFR 10 percent. - Mod.JW] and 10 survivors as of 16 Jun 2014.

The Minister lauded the sacrifices made by health professionals, pointing out that in the process of saving the lives of other people, some passed away, a tragedy the Minister described as pathetic in the course of saving lives.

She denied claims of health workers abandoning their duty stations and enumerated instances where her staff worked under threat and crisis they could not stand due to community resistance in giving the necessary cooperation in managing the situation for referrals and treatment.

Commenting on the Kailahun situation, Madam Kargbo said: "Before now, Kailahun had 14 Surveillance Officers, but with the current trend, 300 volunteers have been recruited, bringing the number to 314 to enhance effective surveillance systems." Apart from the sensitization of Parliamentarians in the wake of the EVD outbreak in Guinea, Religious Leaders, Tribal Heads in the Western Area, [Motor] Bike Riders, the Motor Drivers Union, Traders, Paramount Chiefs and Media Practitioners have been sensitized and given orientation to help create the necessary awareness and education on the prevention of the disease.

The Minister spoke on the closure of schools in Kailahun and the risk of children contacting the disease, pointing out that the continuity of schooling is a risk, whilst the closure is a life-saving intervention.

Some of the challenges and lessons learnt, the Minister said, include negative press reports that could be disastrous, strong resistance from communities, escapees from treatment and observation units, total support for nationwide awareness raising campaigns, and the resources for health promotion and logistics for case management.

The Parliamentarians described some utterances in some radio stations and newspapers as disastrous to the fight to contain the disease and reiterated their total commitment and willingness to collaborate with the Ministry, its partners and Inter-Ministerial Committee to make the necessary impact.

The Parliamentarians in their contributions lauded the Ministry for the hard work since the outbreak in Guinea, and pledged to go to their various constituencies to sensitize their people. They call on all and sundry to put aside partisan, regionalism noting that the current crisis is a core task for Sierra Leoneans.

[5] Sierra Leone: misinformation

The regional treasurer of the Sierra Leone Commercial Motor Bike Riders Union eastern region, Mohamed Sheriff, said [on 16 Jun 2014] that one of the ways of transferring ebolavirus is through the exchange of helmets by passengers and called on the authorities to stop the use of helmets at the moment, since the virus can be transferred through body contact [see comment below].

<promed@promedmail.org>

[Transmission could only occur if blood or vomit had contaminated the helmet. Banning their use is likely to add more deaths from head injuries in accidents than a ban could ever prevent from EVD.

There seem to be some conflicting figures for cases and deaths in these reports, but as WHO reminds us, this is an evolving situation in which numbers are subject to revision.

The misinformation reported above shows that there is still some way to go to inform the public of risk behaviors leading to transmission. - Mod.JW
