A novel begomovirus with distinct genomic and phenotypic features infects
tomato in Bangladesh
M. N. Maruthi <m.n.maruthi@gre.ac.uk>, Natural Resources Institute, University
of Greenwich, Central Avenue, Chatham Maritime, Kent ME4 4TB, UK; A. R. Rekha
(as for Maruthi);S. N. Alam, Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute,
Joydebpur, Gazipur, Bangladesh; K. A. Kader (as Alam); A. Cork (as for
Maruthi); and J.Colvin (as for Maruthi) Accepted for publication 10 May 2005.

In Bangladesh tomato is cultivated over ca. 40 000 acres annually. Tomato leaf
curl virus disease (ToLCVD) normally reduces tomato production significantly,
often causing up to 100 percent yield loss. Diseased tomato plants were
collected from Joydebpur, Bangladesh, in September 2003, because they
exhibited unusually mild ToLCVD symptoms of yellowing and leaf curling. In
addition, "mosaic-like" symptoms developed on the older leaves of the
susceptible tomato variety "Moneymaker", which is atypical for leaf curl-
inducing viruses.
Total DNA was extracted from leaves with symptoms and putative viral genomes
were amplified by PCR using degenerate primers specific to DNA-A and -B and
DNA-beta molecules. Sequences generated from the amplicons were either used to
design virus-specific primers or to obtain directly complete viral sequences.
A previously undescribed monopartite begomovirus, designated Tomato leaf curl
Joydebpur virus-Mild (ToLCJV-Mld), was found associated with these mild
symptoms. Based on DNA-A sequences (2761 nucleotides, EMBL Accession No.
AJ875159), ToLCJV-Mld was most similar to Pepper leaf curl Bangladesh virus
(AF314531) at 87.1 percent nt [nucleotide] identity. ToLCJV-Mld satellite DNA-
molecule (1366 nt, AJ966244) shared highest (59.0 percent) nt identity with a
molecule isolated from ToLCVD in India (AY438558). No DNA-B component was
detected.
The number and arrangement of ToLCJV-Mld DNA-A open reading frames (ORFs) was
identical to monopartite begomoviruses, except that an additional ORF of 849
nt (282 amino acids) was predicted to occur on the complementary strand
between nt positions 1139 and 291 encompassing the entire length of the coat
protein gene. The association of a DNA-beta molecule with begomoviruses is
known to cause severe symptoms, but to our knowledge this is the 1st report
where it was associated with mild symptoms. ToLCJV-Mld DNA-A shared 86.0
percent and 74.4 percent nt identities with the previously reported Tomato
leaf curl Bangladesh virus (AF188481) and Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus-
Severe [Jessore] (AJ875157), respectively.
These results confirm the occurrence of at least 3 begomovirus species in
tomato in Bangladesh.

[Plant virologists continue to report new begomoviruses, and new ones will
undoubtedly emerge. The combination of high temperatures, presence of high
populations of whiteflies, and suitable natural host plants apparently results
in a mix that is conducive to generating new begomovirus strains in the
region. The most significant aspect of this piece is the interaction between
Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV-[cowpea strain]) and its DNA
satellite (beta). Plants infected by MYMIV satellite DNA-beta express more
severe symptoms compared to those inoculated with MYMIV alone. Similar
results have been reported for other DNA-beta molecules and viruses. The
begomovirus-satellite disease complexes are associated with economically
important diseases and have been isolated from vegetable and fiber crops,
ornamental plants, and weeds throughout Africa and Asia. Their widespread
distribution and diversity, coupled to the global movement of plant material
and the dissemination of the whitefly vector, suggests that these disease
complexes pose a serious threat to tropical and sub-tropical agro-ecosystems
worldwide.
Disease management of ToLCV and other begomoviruses depends on preventing
movement of _Bemisia tabaci_ [Bt] -infected plants (e.g. tomato transplants)
to virus-free areas, where the virus can become established. Various control
options include removal of infected plants (roguing, removal, or burial of
infected crop residues) and intercropping in combination with chemical
insecticides and use of available resistant cultivars. Use of plastic UV-
absorbing screening material to exclude Bt is another method. Genetic
resistance to begomoviruses has been reported in some wild _Lycopersicon_
species such as _L. hirsutum_ and _L. peruvianum_ which might be transferred
to tomato. In Pakistan, resistance to leaf curl virus has been incorporated
into tomato and chili cultivars. - Mod.DH
