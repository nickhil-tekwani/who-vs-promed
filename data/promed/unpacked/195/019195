A member of the Majlis Health Committee, Alireza Marandi, has said
that the true number of [pandemic 2009 influenza] H1N1 patients in
Iran is higher than those claimed by the Health Ministry. [Pandemic]
H1N1 is spreading rapidly in the country, and the figures for the
number of confirmed cases of swine flu are limited to patients
hospitalized with critical conditions, Marandi told the Mehr News
Agency on Saturday [14 Nov 2009]. "A large number of those with H1N1
virus [infection] do not go to physicians and are not included in the
official reports, and therefore are unaccounted for," he added.

"H1N1 will last for at least the next 2 years in Iran," Marandi, a
former Health Minister, pointed out. He further added, "The outbreak
of swine flu is not limited to Iran; it is a global issue." "Closing
schools out of the fear of the spread of influenza cannot be
considered a wise option," Marandi suggested. "We can close a class
temporarily if influenza breaks out in the same class."

Official figures released by the Health Ministry have put the
confirmed cases of [pandemic?] H1N1 virus at around 3000, with 58
confirmed deaths. 25 schoolchildren in Tehran suburbs have contracted
H1N1, of whom 16 have been hospitalized, Tehran's education
department public relations officer Ali Soleimani announced on
Saturday [14 Nov 2009]. Soleminai also that said since last week,
around 253 classrooms in Tehran's suburban schools had been closed
temporarily to limit the spread of H1N1 virus.

Iran's Health Ministry said that [pandemic 2009] influenza A/H1N1 has
claimed the lives of 58 people across the country, as the national
tally of infections passes 2660, local satellite Press TV reported on
Thursday [12 Nov 2009]. "More Iranians died last week from [pandemic]
A/H1N1 influenza virus infection, raising the number of
A/H1N1-related deaths in the country to 58," said the director of the
Health Ministry's Center for Disease Control Mohammad-Mehdi Gouya.

Iran's Ministry of Education officials have closed many schools
around the country amid rising fears of a [pandemic] H1N1 flu
epidemic. On Tuesday [10 Nov 2009], officials closed more than 100
schools in Iran's northwestern province of Zanjan, the report said.

On 3 Nov 2009, Iran's Parliament's Health Commission spokesman
Mohammadreza Rezaei Kuchi confirmed that the virus's death toll had
reached 22 across the country.

[It is clear from this and other recent reports that pandemic (H1N1)
2009 influenza virus infection is now widespread throughout the
Middle East, and efforts to contain the spread of infection have been
ineffectual.
