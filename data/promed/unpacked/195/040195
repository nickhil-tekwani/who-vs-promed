It has been conveyed to us that a rising number of meningococcal meningitis
serogroup A cases is being reported in Moscow. Apparently, the Moscow City
Central Epidemiological Station has noted 25 cases between 1 Aug and 30 Sep
2003, while from 1 to 20 Oct, 22 cases were diagnosed. Laboratory reports
show the meningococcal A strain as the cause of illness in 90 percent of
cases.
268 cases were reported during 2003 so far, which is a 150 percent increase
over 2002. Local health authorities expect a further rise in the number of
cases during the next 3 months due to the cold weather and are urging the
population, especially children, to be vaccinated.
Can anyone confirm the above statistics? Given the large denominator, do
these numbers actually warrant calling this an outbreak? Do we have
historic epidemiological statistics on this in Gideon?

City to Vaccinate 400 000 Children for Meningitis
-------------------------------------------------
Bacterial meningitis has killed 9 children in Moscow so far during the fall
of 2003, and city health authorities have ordered a mass vaccination
campaign to try to prevent an outbreak of the disease. About 400 000
children aged 1-1/2 to 8 years are to be vaccinated and the city has
already allocated the necessary funds, said Nikolai Filatov, head of the
city health inspectorate.
So far this year, 251 Muscovites, most of whom are children, have been hit
by meningitis and 22 have died, including 9 children, Filatov said. The
numbers of cases and fatalities are only slightly higher than in previous
years, but many were registered at the end of the summer and in early fall,
which are normally considered disease-free seasons, said Tatyana
Chernyshova, head of the meningitis laboratory at the Health Ministry's
Gabrichevsky Epidemiology and Microbiology Research Institute. The 9
children all died in September 2003, she said.
Adding to the worry, about 70 percent of the cases have been caused by type
A bacteria, and it was type A bacteria that caused outbreaks of meningitis
in Moscow in the 1980s. Chernyshova said her laboratory is trying to
determine whether the current bacteria in the city are identical to the
bacteria that caused the outbreaks 20 years ago.
"There is no reason to panic yet, but we decided to be on the safe side and
vaccinate before the seasonal increase in the number of cases," Chernyshova
said.
Chernyshova said children in Moscow will get shots of a Russian-made
vaccine, which is almost 1/10 the cost of one manufactured in France. The
Health Ministry's stocks of the vaccine are sufficient, but in the case of
a major outbreak, health authorities might encounter trouble, since the
Russian vaccine is produced in small quantities, she said.

Some background on meningococcal disease in the Russian Federation
---------------------------------------------------
Large epidemics of serogroup A meningococcal disease occurred in Moscow in
1931 and 1940.
In 1968, a serogroup A epidemic was reported in Lipezk.
An outbreak of group A meningococcal meningitis (188 cases) was reported
from Moscow during Jan to Apr 1996 -- primarily affecting the Vietnamese
community [see ProMED refs. below]. As a result, hundreds of thousands of
Muscovites were immunized with A polysaccharide vaccine.
