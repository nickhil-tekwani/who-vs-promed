Over 60 people have died in the last 4 years due to the kala-azar disease [visceral leishmaniasis] in Ngomeni, Mwingi North sub-county, MCA [Member of County Assembly] Eliud Mutati has said. Mutati said the deadly disease is caused by the _Leishmania_ parasites spread by sandfly bites and usually affects the spleen, liver, and bone marrow.

He said the sandflies are found in camel grazing areas and when the desert animals invade parts of Ngomeni that border the Tana River in search of pasture, the flies then bite the residents.

However, despite the area being so vulnerable to sandfly bites, the MCA said dispensaries are not equipped with the required medicine. Treatment in private facilities is very expensive and most residents cannot afford it, hence most of them end up dead. "We plead with the county government to equip our dispensaries and evict camels from our peoples' farms for peace to prevail," the MCA said.

[A recent review of the epidemiology of leishmaniasis in Kenya (Ouma FF, Mulambalah CS. Persistence and changing distribution of leishmaniasis in Kenya require a paradigm shift. J Parasitol Res. 2021; 9989581; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9989581) conclude: "Leishmaniases are emerging and reemerging persistent infections in remote rural settings in Kenya. The adopted intervention strategies have not been effective over the years, and this has led to disease spread to formerly nonendemic areas of Kenya. The diseases spread have been further enhanced by population growth and movement, environmental and climate changes, and social conflicts."
