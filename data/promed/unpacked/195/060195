Rural outbreak of anthrax
-------------------------
On 14 Apr 2010 in Sierras Bayas, county of Olavarria, Buenos Aires
province, a cow died suddenly with a bloody extravasation from its mouth,
vagina, and anus. It was in a herd of some 100 animals. The affected animal
and the herd had not been vaccinated against anthrax. Laboratorio Azul
confirmed the presence of _Bacillus anthracis_ and it was sensitive to the
following antibiotics: penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin,
florfenicol, and tilmicosin. The carcass was disposed of in the standard
fashion, covered with lime and a heavy duty plastic sheet, weighed down on
the margins.

[Our thanks to Ramon for this report. Although there is a provincial policy
for annual vaccination, their estancieros, like our ranchers, sometimes
believe that they can get away with not vaccinating. An expensive decision
in an enzootic area as the Sterne vaccine is the cheapest vaccine in the
world and very effective. And the community pays as it stretches out the
eradication process. To get rid of this disease one merely has to stop
recontaminating the soil with fresh spores through new cases. The spores
already there will die and on the whole fairly quickly. The good news is
that such outbreaks target specific areas that must continue to be
persuaded to annually vaccinate for the next 5-10 years.
