Japan's Bird Flu Fight to Cost 104.8 Million Yen by March
---------------------------------------------------
Japan will have spent 104.8 million yen (USD 951 427) by 31 Mar 2004
on emergency measures to eradicate avian influenza, which has broken
out in 3 locations in the country, said Sadakazu Tanigaki, Japan's
finance minister.
The government will subsidize the building of windowless coops to
prevent wild birds and mice from infecting chickens, and maintain its
policy of halting imports of poultry from countries where the disease
is spreading, the government said in a release. It will also check
for dirt on the shoes of travelers returning to Japan from countries
including Thailand, China, and Viet Nam.
The most recent outbreak of the disease, discovered on a farm in
Kyoto last week, prompted calls from opposition politicians for
tighter regulation of shipments of birds and eggs and the need to
more quickly implement detection measures.
The farmer in Kyoto didn't immediately report a sudden increase in
dead chickens, and continued deliveries to food processing plants and
other customers.
The government plans to distribute screening kits to farmers who have
any doubts about the health of their chickens. Tests will also be
carried out on samples of dead or captured crows with appropriate
measures applied after the tests, the release said.
