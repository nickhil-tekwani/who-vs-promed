Madagascar: 8 deaths due to food poisoning with sardinella

This deadly fish consumed during the rainy season has killed 8 people in northern Madagascar, with 32 people admitted to Antsiranana Hospital.

The consumption of sardinella, a kind of large sardine has killed 8 people in Antsiranana in the north of the Big Island. This fish, which feeds on toxic algae during the rainy season, becomes deadly. In total, 8 people lost their lives and 32 others are still admitted to the hospital.

The patients suffer from nausea, headaches and very violent diarrhea. Among the victims was a 6-year-old child.

Problem of sardinella being sold to the markets

As a result of this deadly food poisoning, city officials went to the markets to confiscate the sardinella still waiting on the counters, waiting to be sold. The seized products were immediately buried near the city of Antsiranana, reports RFI.

For its part, the Malagasy State has also taken its responsibilities by taking care of the people who have been poisoned.

Open inquiry

Nearly 23 other fish species are also suspected to be toxic during the rainy season. Researchers in tropical medicine in the Indian Ocean have explained that toxins are found in the skin, flesh and viscera of these animals.

City officials continue the raids to ensure traders have destroyed all their stock of infected fish. An investigation is also under way, but the police have not yet registered a complaint.

[The article does not tell us enough about the clinical signs the victims demonstrated. However, historically, the Sardinia sp has most often been found to have Saxitoixn as the toxic agent in its tissues.

Most often the harmful algal bloom produces saxitoxin. Saxitoxin is one of the toxins produced in what is known as paralytic shellfish poisoning.

Saxitoxin is a very potent inhibitor of voltage-gated sodium channels, but specifically the Navs channels responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in nerve and muscle cells.

The algae is consumed by the fish where the toxin is then consumed by humans. - Mod.TG]
