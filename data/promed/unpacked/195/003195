The New York state Department of Health has confirmed a case of Powasssan virus [infection] in Dutchess County. The rare tick-borne disease is the county's 1st case this year [2017].

The state Health Department confirmed the case this week [week of Sun 15 Oct 2017] and was reporting it to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [Fri 20 Oct 2017]. The case in Dutchess is the 4th in the state in 2017; the 3 other cases were in Saratoga County over the summer. Bryon Backenson is Deputy Director of the Bureau of Communicable Disease Control with DOH and underscores that Powassan is extremely rare.

"We usually don't try and publicize a single case of disease, but one of the reasons that we're trying to do it now is because there is a tick risk," Backenson says. "There's always a tick risk in October and November. It's something that people don't necessarily realize." He says the adult ticks are out now and stay out until it grows consistently cold.

[Powassan virus is endemic in New York state and cases occur there sporadically. The tick vector is the deer tick, _Ixodes scapularis_. As noted in a comment in an earlier post, the remarkable thing about POWV transmission by the deer tick is the remarkably short feeding time required to transmit the virus. The rapid transmission of this virus by its vector is discussed in: Hermance ME, Thangamani S. Powassan Virus. An emerging arbovirus of public health concern in North America. Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2017; 17(7); doi: 10.1089/vbz.2017.2110. [Epub ahead of print] http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/vbz.2017.2110: "The duration of _Ixodes scapularis_, the deer tick, attachment required for successful transmission of Powassan virus to a host was found to be as little as 15 min by Ebel and Kramer (Ebel GD, Kramer LD. Short report: duration of tick attachment required for transmission of Powassan virus by deer ticks. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2004; 71(3): 268-71; https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8332784_Short_report_Duration_of_tick_attachment_required_for_transmission_of_Powassan_virus_by_deer_ticks) in 2004. This Ô¨Ånding was particularly striking because unlike other tickborne pathogens (_Borrelia burgdorferi_, _Babesia microti_, and _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_), very little time between tick attachment and virus transmission is needed. The risk of transmission will continue until seasonal freezing temperatures occur and ticks become inactive.
