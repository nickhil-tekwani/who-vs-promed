O Hotz de Baar commented on Fri, 29 Aug 1997 that the discrepancy between
reported and expected cases of BSE in Europe was utterly predictable due to
the unscientific practice of slaughtering whole herds where a case was
found (in the case of Germany, whole breeds).
This point was queried by the PROMED moderator who felt that herd
depopulation is a well recognized disease control option, and therefore
could not be called "unscientific".
Some PROMED subscribers may not know that the issue of surveillance and
control systems for BSE was widely discussed during the electronic
conference on the Surveillance for the Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathies (TSEs) of Livestock which we in the New Zealand Ministry
of Agriculture ran for the month of May 1997.
One of the threads of discussion during our conference was the effect that
different control policies have on the reporting of BSE. Several postings
suggested that control measures have a significant effect on surveillance
for BSE.
In summary, the argument goes like this:
Where a single case of BSE results in the slaughter of an entire herd,
there is a very strong incentive for the stock-owner to insure that a
suspect case of BSE never comes to the attention of the authorities. After
all, cattle die of many different causes, and a good stockman can detect
the early signs of BSE while they are still very subtle.
Picture yourself in the position of the owner of a much-loved and
highly-valued herd. Perhaps these are prize-winning stud animals, in a
herd first established by your father or grandfather. You notice a cow
showing signs of BSE. You immediately report your suspicions to the
authorities, right?
Really? So you can see your life's work destroyed?
Adding to the pressure to cover up a case of BSE is the knowledge that this
is NOT a contagious disease. It is a good chance that there will only ever
be the one case. So, there is little scientific rationale for whole of
herd slaughter.
For those PROMED members who are not aware, the proceedings of the
electronic conference can be found on the Ministry of Agriculture's
homepage on the web at the following address:

[Thanks very much for sharpening the argument. I queried the previous
posting because I wanted to point out that a choice of disease control
tactics is, in the end, a choice among control tactics depending on
biological, economic, social and political factors. I was concerned that
the use of the word unscientific would be equated with irrational. The
unfortunate truth is that a disease control tactic may have little
scientific backing from a biological perspective but in fact have enormous
economic or political advantages that would make it the best choice in a
particular situation.
However, I did not want to suggest that this was necessarily appropriate
for BSE and herd depopulation and so I really appreciate your comments.
Furthermore, your scenario points out why it may be so difficult to obtain
good surveillance data when there is a powerful incentive to NOT report a
disease. Thanks - Mod. pc
