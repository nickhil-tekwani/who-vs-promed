Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments
On 23 Feb 2017, the Central Veterinary Laboratory at Algete (National Reference Laboratory for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies accredited under UNE-EN ISO/IEC 17025:2005 for all TSE diagnostic tests) received a bovine brainstem sample from the regional accredited animal health laboratory of Castilla y Leon (official regional laboratory) after a positive result was obtained through the Bio-Rad TeSeE SAP rapid test. The National Reference Laboratory undertook the confirmatory tests authorized according to Regulation (EU) No. 1148/2014. The selected tests associated were Idex HerdChek BSE/Scrapie Antigen Test Kit and Western blot (Prionics). Following confirmation of BSE, the National Reference Laboratory went on with tests to discriminate the BSE strains by immunoblotting with results for atypical BSE type L on 1 Mar 2017. The sample was taken within the national TSE surveillance program (sampling of dead or non-slaughtered animals for human consumption over 48 months old). The animal was a crossbred female born on 12 Jan 2003.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, disinfection / disinfestations, traceability, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, modified stamping out, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: official destruction of animal products

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Central Veterinary Laboratory, Algete (National laboratory)/
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / electroimmunotransfer blot assay (EITB) / 1 Mar 2017 / Positive
Cattle / Western blot / 27 Feb 2017/ Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

"Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a fatal neurological disease of adult cattle that was first recognized in Great Britain (GB) and that has been identified in classical (C-type BSE) and atypical forms. Both C-type BSE and atypical forms have been detected in cattle indigenous to most European countries, the Americas, and Asia and the Pacific. BSE is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), or prion disease.

"The C-type BSE epizootic resulted from oral exposure to prions in the ruminant-derived protein of meat-and-bone meal and milk replacers included in animal feedstuffs. As a result of control measures, C-type BSE epizootics are in decline.

"Experimental transmissibility of all forms of BSE to cattle has been demonstrated. The C-type BSE agent is also believed to be the common source, via dietary routes, of TSEs in other ruminant species and felidae. There is evidence of a causal link between the C-type BSE agent and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (VCJD) in humans. Recommendations for handling BSE-infected material assume that BSE is a zoonosis and manipulations with potentially contaminated material must be performed at an appropriate biosafety and containment level determined by biorisk analysis.

"Little is known about the clinical presentation of naturally occurring atypical BSE as most of these cases were detected by active surveillance of fallen stock or apparently healthy cattle, and correlation of laboratory diagnostic data with clinical histories is lacking. An interesting common feature is that cases of atypical BSE were almost exclusively detected in cattle older than 8 years. Data from experimental intracerebral inoculation of cattle suggest that the clinical signs in H- and L-type BSE may include those observed in C-type BSE, but dullness and difficulty in rising are also prominent features of the clinical presentation in these animals.

"So far, approximately 100 atypical BSE cases have been recognized that differ in their molecular profiles by Western immunoblotting from C-type BSE. Bioassay data support the hypothesis that these strains are biologically distinct from C-type BSE. The 2 atypical forms are operationally defined as BASE (bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy) or L-type, and H-type BSE based on the lower or higher mass respectively of the unglycosylated PrPSc fragment in Western immunoblots compared to C-type BSE". - Mod.CRD
