The Missouri Department of Agriculture's Division of Animal Health
confirmed positive test results for equine infectious anemia (EIA) in
2 horses earlier this month [January 2011] in northeastern Missouri.

Department officials have tested 696 other horses, including those
located nearby and any that may have been in contact with the infected
animals. No further positive cases have been identified.

On 5 Jan 2011, a Belgian horse in rural Pike County tested positive
for EIA. The animal was immediately quarantined, and humanely
euthanized following additional testing in mid-January. A 2nd horse on
the farm also tested positive for EIA on 7 Jan 2011. That horse was
humanely euthanized, as well.

"Although this disease does not affect humans, it is a disease that
can have a devastating impact on our equine industry," said director
of agriculture Dr Jon Hagler. "We will continue to closely monitor the
situation and remind horse owners to schedule regular Coggins tests
with their veterinarian to screen for this disease."

EIA is a contagious viral disease most commonly transmitted through
horse flies, deer flies, mosquitoes and gnats. The disease is found in
all equine species, including horses, ponies, donkeys, and mules, but
does not affect humans. There are no known vaccines available to
prevent or protect from this disease.

Individuals with questions or concerns about the safety of their
livestock following these actions are encouraged to contact the
Department with their questions at (573) 751-3377.

[The United States Department of Agriculture has thoughtfully provided
educational material to owners, to state authorities, and to all of
us. There is an educational brochure on EIA at the USDA Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service page at
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_diseases/eia/downloads/eia-1996.pdf>.

Equine infectious anemia (EIA) affects Equidae and is caused by an
equid-specific lentivirus in the retrovirus family, equine infectious
anemia virus (EIAV). Although the majority of persistent infections
appear to have minimal clinical consequences, EIA may be seen in
epizootic form with high morbidity and mortality. Infection can be
accurately diagnosed with laboratory tests. Because there are no
effective and safe vaccines, many countries have established control
programs based on serologic testing.

EIA is a blood borne infection; the virus can be found free in the
plasma or cell-associated. Infection with EIAV appears to persist for
life and, in nature, blood-feeding insects initiate most infections by
mechanical transfer of infective blood between horses in close
proximity. Tabanids, horseflies, and deer flies appear to be the most
efficient vectors because the pain of their bite initiates host
defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in additional
host-seeking behavior. As EIAV has not been shown to multiply in
insects, infected equids appear to be the only reservoir of the virus.
Iatrogenic transmission has a high epizootic potential that can be
avoided by standard precautions, such as, disposal or decontamination
of needles and equipment between horses.

Exposed equids generally support viral replication for days to weeks
before antibodies to EIAV can be detected. The incubation period
ranges from 10 to 45 days or more, usually lasting 21-42 days after
natural transmission. Peak viremia often occurs during a febrile
episode before the horse becomes test-positive. These acute signs
often go unrecognized in horses on pasture and may be accompanied by a
mild reduction in platelet counts and transient inappetence. Often,
infection is noted only after routine surveillance testing for EIA or
when the horse develops recurring clinical bouts of fever accompanied
by marked platelet reductions, petechial hemorrhages, anemia,
depression, weight loss, cachexia, and dependent edema (hallmarks of
the chronic form of EIA). EIAV infection can therefore present as an
inapparent infection or as an acute or chronic disease. The clinical
manifestations are determined in part by the viral strain and dose,
and the genetic makeup and status of the immune system of the equid.
For example, strains of EIAV adapted by rapid serial passage in horses
can kill horses within 14 days of infection but may have no clinical
effect on donkeys. Likewise, strains that produce no or mild clinical
disease in adults have killed immunologically immature fetuses or
immunodeficient foals. Frequently, EIAV enters a herd and is
transmitted silently until the chronic form of the disease is noted.
By that time, a high percentage of the herd can be infected.

Clinical diagnosis should be confirmed by serology. The agar gel
immunodiffusion (AGID, Coggins) test is internationally accepted;
antigen sources include cell culture-propagated virus and recombinant
proteins. ELISA tests for detection of antibody against EIAV antigens
are accepted in many countries and aid in the practical diagnosis of
EIAV infection. The ELISA tests can be done in minutes (compared with
1-2 days for AGID test results) and used under field conditions. In
all cases, positive ELISA tests should be confirmed by AGID before
regulatory actions are taken because of the higher rate of false
positive results. When combined, ELISA and AGID testing afford the
highest level of sensitivity and specificity.

No specific treatment or vaccine is available. As EIAV-infected equids
present the only known source of infection, antibody-positive animals
should be kept at a safe distance (around 200 m) from other equids.
The only recognized exception to this rule is the progeny of
test-positive mares, which may possess maternal antibodies to EIAV. In
the majority of cases, passive antibody against EIAV wanes to negative
on AGID tests by 6-8 months of age.

The risk associated with maintaining EIAV-infected breeding stock
varies. Field studies have indicated excellent success in raising
test-negative foals from inapparent carriers of EIAV. The risks of
infection in utero increase dramatically if clinical signs of EIA are
seen in the mare prior to parturition. Unfortunately, it is not
possible to accurately determine the risk posed by any EIAV-infected
equid. As EIAV persists in each infected equid for life, most
regulatory agencies assume all EIAV-positive equids pose the same high
risk.

Most states have some type of regulatory program as well as
surveillance requiring testing prior to changing ownership.
