LegionnairesÂ’ disease in Europe, 1997
Twenty-four member countries of the European working group for _Legionella_
infections (EWGLI) contributed data to the 1997 European dataset. The data
were obtained through completion of a set of reporting forms which have
been used annually since 1993. The forms consist of 7 tables which collate
data from the participating countries in a standardized way. The same 24
countries contributed data in both 1996 and 1997.
The aggregated data show a total of 1 360 cases of legionnaires' disease in
1997. This was 203 fewer cases than were reported in 1996, but 105 more
than in 1995. However, if the cases associated with the large community
outbreak in Spain in 1996 are considered separately, the overall trends are
upwards since 1995. Ten countries reported more cases in 1997 than in 1996,
9 reported less and 5 the same number in both years. Five countries
reported more than 100 cases each (Denmark, England and Wales, France,
Germany (area) and Spain)...
Conclusion
The coordinating centre is grateful to all the collaborators for providing
more and better information to the scheme each year. In 1995,
epidemiological information was available on about 50% of the European
dataset. In 1996 this increased to 60%, and in 1997 it was nearly 70% of
the dataset. The value of the epidemiology is reflected in the higher
proportion of deaths reported, the number of clusters detected and the
reported increase in cases associated with travel.
Outbreaks linked to community-acquired infection continued to be
underrepresented in the European dataset. Only England reported them in
1997. However, it is assumed that other European countries with towns and
cities that include industrial and commercial areas must also have had
similar outbreaks, since poorly maintained cooling towers and
air-conditioning systems are internationally recognized sources of
community-acquired _Legionella_ infection. Travel-associated infections on
the other hand were reported by several countries, and highlight the
emphasis within Europe in following up cases which may have a detrimental
effect on local tourist economies.
>From the total dataset in 1997, the proportion of cases which were linked
to travel was 22%. These cases were included in the European surveillance
scheme for travel-associated legionnaires' disease which was established in
1987. The scheme, which has been coordinated from London since 1993 and
supported by funds from the European Commission, has been highly successful
in meeting its objectives of detecting clusters and outbreaks of
travel-associated infection. This funding continues until January 2000.
