There are fears of complications after last year's [2007] outbreak. A
health alert has been declared in Paraguay in a bid to stop a new
outbreak of dengue fever.

Health workers have detected some 150 suspected cases of the
mosquito-borne disease so far this year [2008].

A senior Paraguayan official said there was concern that neighbouring
Brazil had also seen a recent rise in dengue and some dozen cases of
yellow fever.

Last year [2007], 17 people died from dengue fever in Paraguay, and
the authorities were criticised for not acting sooner. "Dengue is
defeated in the streets. We can fight the mosquitoes, chiefly by
getting rid of stagnant pools of water," said Paraguayan President
Nicanor Duarte as the health alert was declared.

His government was accused of missing warning signs in January a year
ago [2007] and failing to tackle the disease properly. A total of
some 27 000 cases were registered during 2007, 17 of them fatal.

The Paraguayan Health Minister, Oscar Martinez, said the latest
suspected cases were being analysed. "We have 11 confirmed cases
after the initial tests, and so we will wait a fortnight to carry out
a 2nd test to confirm whether it is dengue," he told the BBC. "We're
asking people to support us and help us get rid of places where
mosquitoes can breed," he said.

Officials say their concern is that people who were infected last
year [2007] might be more susceptible to more serious forms of the
disease. There is a much greater risk of dengue haemorrhagic fever or
dengue shock syndrome when a person has immunity to one of the other
types of dengue virus as a result of previous infection.

There were 41 neurological dengue cases [that] were recorded in the
country last year [2007], according to the figures published by the
Ministry of Health and released yesterday [29 Jan 2007] in Brazilia.
Sao Paulo state, which registered the largest dengue epidemic in its
history, led with the largest number of notifications [neurologic
dengue cases], with 9, followed by Para (6), Piaui (6) e Parana (4),
Alagoas (3), Maranhao (2) and Rio Grande do Norte (2). One case each
was registered in Amazonas, Amapa, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Bahia,
Espirito Santo, Minas, Rio de Janeiro and Mato Grosso do Sul.

[The classification of "neurologic dengue" does not exist; dengue can
have neurologic complications, such as encephalitis and peripheral
neuropathies. This report of neurological complications is nothing
exceptional, since there is the increase in dengue cases in Brazil,
complications will be more visible. - Mod.LJS, trans. Mod.TY]

<http://www.oge.sld.pe/boletines/2008/02.pdf>


In the 2nd epidemiological week [SE 2; 2nd week of January 2008], the
country-wide notification of classic dengue cases was 254, of which 6
have been confirmed by the [Direccion General de Epidemiologia,
Ministerio de Salud (DIRESA) -- in English: Office of the Director of
Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health] Madre de Dios laboratories.
[Of these], 78 percent are from DIRESA Loreto (55 percent) and
Ucayali (23 percent) [regions]. Up to SE 02, 11 health directorates
have [provided] notification of locally acquired dengue cases. There
has been a continuous Dengue outbreak in the Loreto DIRESA during the
1st 2 weeks of 2008. Jaen and Madre de Dios, having been in an
epidemic [situation] during the 1st week [of January 2008], have had
a reduction [in the number of] cases. Until now, there have been no
cases of DHF.

Up to the 2nd epidemiological week, 33 districts have [given]
notification of dengue cases. The districts reporting 52 percent of
the cases in the country are: Belem, Iquitos, San Juan Bautista and
Punchana of the Loreto DIRESA.

[The report goes on to give a detailed breakdown of dengue cases by
district within the DIRESAs. - Mod.TY]

A rapid evaluation of _Aedes_ [dengue virus vector mosquito]
infestation in December 2007 gave indices of 15 percent and 6.7
percent in these 2 districts. [It is not clear from this report
whether these indices are percentages of houses/buildings infested
with _Aedes_, as seems likely, or the proportion of suitable
containers having larvae or pupae. - Mod.TY]

[4] New Caledonia
Date: Fri 1 Feb 2008

Health authorities in New Caledonia are considering the current
health situation as a pre-epidemic stage with regards to the
hemorrhagic, mosquito-transmitted dengue fever, with 15 new cases
detected since the beginning of this month [January 2008] here in the
capital Noumea and its immediate suburbs.

Authorities say the January [2008] figures, provided by the
Noumea-based Institut Pasteur, are of particular concern, since the
whole figure for 2007 was 47 cases reported.

Most of the new reported cases were detected in the Greater Noumea
area, especially in the suburban town of Dumbea, New Caledonia's
health and social department pointed out.

The alarm comes as New Caledonia and its greater region are facing
severe weather conditions characterized by high humidity and heavy
rains, which are triggering factors for mosquito-borne diseases such
as dengue fever, malaria, typhoid, dysentery or leptospirosis.

New Caledonia's health and prevention department has for the past few
weeks stepped up its prevention and awareness campaign against the
potentially deadly virus, mainly because of the heavy rains and the
hot and humid conditions currently affecting New Caledonia.

Health authorities are therefore considering that, at present, even
though there is no epidemic as yet, the health risk for dengue fever
is at a maximum.

As part of the prevention campaign, Noumea's health and hygiene
services have also deployed since the beginning of this month
[February 2008] a team of a dozen of officers, whose main task is to
visit house and property owners and convince them to clean any
potential mosquito breeding site, such as still water contained in
old tires and plant pots or any bushy area on their compound that
could also become a nest for mosquito larvae.

Cebu City has the highest fatality rate of DHF, as health officials
prepare to set up a plan along with other stakeholders for the
simultaneous nationwide launching of the intensified campaign drive
against dengue set next month [February 2008]. Department of Health
(DOH-7) Regional Director Dr. Susana Madarieta, during the Kapihan sa
PIA this morning [31 Jan 2008] on dengue updates, said that out of
the total 6640 recorded dengue cases in Central Visayas last year
[2007], 148 of the victims died of the disease, constituting a 2.2
percent mortality rate.

Out of the top 10 areas in the region that have a high incidence of
dengue cases, 7 of these areas belong to Cebu Province, Madarieta said.

Cebu City tops the list of areas with a high incidence rate of
dengue, with over 1600 cases, followed by Tagbilaran City, while the
3rd spot is Mandaue City with 355 cases and 14 recorded deaths, it is reported.

Other areas in Cebu having a high incidence of dengue include
Minglanilla, Talisay City, San Fernando, City of Naga and Toledo
City, while the other 3 areas are in Bohol and included Dauis and Jagna.

DOH-7 Chief on Communicable Diseases Dr. Jocelyn Abellana revealed
that most of the victims were as young as 4-months-old with the
oldest at 68-years-old, while the majority belonged to the lower
socio-economic class, as the dengue virus [and dengue virus vector
_Aedes_ mosquitoes. - Mod.TY] thrives more in densely populated areas.

Madarieta also admitted that Region 7 ranks 3rd on the most number of
morbidity cases of dengue next to the National Capital Region and Region 3.

From 2006-2007, the number of dengue cases ballooned to 109 percent
higher than the previous year, as there were only 3172 cases of
dengue recorded in 2006, with 76 deaths, although the mortality rate
was then 2.4 percent, Madarieta further said.

Because of the rising incidence of dengue cases in the country, the
DOH has stepped up an intensified campaign drive against dengue with
a simultaneous nationwide launching scheduled on 21 Feb [2008], which
will be a whole-year round advocacy.

Madarieta said that previously, they only launched the dengue
advocacy drive during the start of the rainy season, but with the
growing incidence of dengue cases, the intensified advocacy will be a
whole-year round campaign.

The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the carrier of the dengue virus, is a
daytime vector that thrives in clean stagnant water, and health
officials once again stressed the importance of cleaning one's
surroundings and destroying the possible breeding sites of the
dengue-carrier vector. Madarieta added that they will seek the
involvement of other stakeholders in the community, such as the local
government units, religious sector and the barangay captains to help
the government in its whole-year campaign drive against dengue.
