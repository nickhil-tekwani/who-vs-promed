A recently discovered virus known to infect ruminants in parts of Europe might infect horses, as well: Researchers have just identified antibodies to the Schmallenberg virus, transmitted by flying insects, in 10 Iranian horses.

They are the 1st horses worldwide to test positive for these antibodies, the scientists said.

In screening for antibodies in cattle, sheep, and goats, as well as in horses, the researchers discovered, unexpectedly, that members of the equine species tested positive along with the other species, said Mehdi Rasekh, DVM, DVSc, an assistant professor of large animal internal medicine at the University of Zabol Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, in Iran.

"The results surprised us because the positive response was expected in ruminants but detecting antibodies against Schmallenberg virus in horses was a new finding in the world," Rasekh said.

Scientists discovered the Schmallenberg virus in 2011 in Germany and The Netherlands, where it infected cattle, sheep, and goats, he said. Those infections generally led to fever, fetal malformations, and abortion.

Like African horse sickness (AHS) and bluetongue virus, Schmallenberg virus is transmitted by biting midges. With climate change and greater human and animal movement, these tiny winged insects are crossing borders and bringing with them an increased disease risk.

Concerned about the spread of midge-borne diseases into neighboring Turkey, Rasekh and his fellow researchers conducted a serological survey of at-risk species in Iran. They conducted blood tests on a random population of three species of ruminants as well as on 200 randomly selected horses.

They weren't surprised to find positive results in the cattle, sheep, and goats, given Turkey's close proximity with its seropositive population, Rasekh said. However, as many as 5 percent of the tested horses also had positive results.

"Of course, this means new challenges for the equine industry," he said.

None of the horses showed clinical signs, however. It's possible that the disease had already run its course by the time the horses were tested, and the antibodies were still present in the system, Rasekh explained. It's also possible that horses just don't show clinical disease despite infection.

There's also a possibility that the ELISA test is giving false positives, he added. "We cannot completely rely on serologic tests to confirm the disease in horses," he said. "More reliable tests (like a PCR test) are needed to show the virus or its residues, like the virus genome, to confirm the disease in horses."

The study, "Detection of Schmallenberg virus antibody in equine population of Northern and Northeast of Iran," was published in Veterinary World.

Rasekh M, Sarani A, Hashemi SH: Detection of Schmallenberg virus antibody in equine population of Northern and North-East of Iran, Vet World. 2018; 11(1): 30-33. doi: 10.14202/vetworld.2018.30-33; available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5813508/.

Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is a newly emerging RNA virus belonging to Simbu serogroup of _Peribunyaviridae_ genus from the Peribunyaviridae family and like as other diseases that caused by Simbu serogroup viruses can induce congenital malformations, stillbirth, severe arthrogryposis, torticollis, brachygnathia [short lower jaw], hydrocephaly, ataxia, paralysis, muscle atrophy, joint malformations, scoliosis, behavioral abnormalities, and blindness in fetuses and neonates, especially in ruminants. These malformations have been designated arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly syndrome.

SBV was first detected in November 2011, in Germany from samples collected in summer/autumn 2011 from diseased dairy cattle exhibiting fever and reduced milk yield. Similar clinical signs (including diarrhea) were detected in dairy cows in the Netherlands where the presence of SBV was also confirmed in December 2011.

Congenital malformations were initially reported in 2012 in newborn lambs in the Netherlands, and SBV was detected in, and isolated from, the brain tissue. Further spread of SBV to many other countries in continental Europe, the British Isles, the Mediterranean Basin, and Turkey was reported, indicating that SBV was circulating widely across this region in 2012. In the following years, it was detected in new and previously affected countries, affecting ruminants.

According to OIE's 'technical factsheet' addressing SBV (last updated June 2017), the virus has been confirmed by PCR or virus isolation in the following species: Cattle, sheep, goats, bison, roe deer, Mouflon, and (a single case of a PCR-positive) dog. The animals above are thus regarded susceptible to SBV infection potentially causing the syndrome of congenital malformations.

According to the said OIE factsheet, the tests applied for serological evidence of past SBV infection are: ELISA (commercial kits available), indirect immunofluorescence and neutralization test.

SBV has been confirmed, by serology only, in the following species: red deer, sika deer, fallow deer, alpacas, wild boar, and various further wild ruminants and some zoo animals.

The factsheet states, "Serological results (ELISA) for index cases should be confirmed by neutralisation tests (NT)." It will be interesting to note if/when NT confirmation is obtained for the described serological tests in horses.

The technical factsheet is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Our_scientific_expertise/docs/pdf/A_Schmallenberg_virus.pdf. - Mod.AS
