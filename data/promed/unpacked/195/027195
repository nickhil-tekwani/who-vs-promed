France on Saturday [25 Feb 2006] confirmed the presence of the deadly H5N1
strain of bird flu at a farm in the east of the country where thousands of
turkeys had died.
The outbreak was discovered on Thursday at the farm with 11 000 turkeys in
the Ain department, where 2 cases of H5N1 had already been confirmed in
wild ducks.
Laboratory tests by Afssa, France's national agency for nutritional safety,
showed that the virus found at the turkey farm was 99 per cent homologous
with that found in one of the ducks, the Agriculture Ministry said in a
statement. An investigation was under way to establish how the farm became
contaminated with the virus, the ministry added.
"What worries us, and this is why we have reacted immediately, is that the
farm is within the protection zone that we set up for the first duck," farm
minister Dominique Bussereau told French television on Friday, when the
authorities were testing for the virus [see comment]. Poultry sales in
France are already down by about 30 per cent.
The industry received another blow on Friday when Japan's embassy in Paris
said Tokyo had imposed a temporary ban on imports of French poultry
products after bird flu was found at the turkey farm.
"In France they have found a farm-raised fowl contaminated with the virus.
It's Japan's policy to ban poultry imports from countries hit by bird flu,"
an embassy spokesman said, adding that the ban was temporary and would take
effect immediately.
The deadly virus is highly contagious among poultry and can spread through
an entire flock within hours. It remains difficult for humans to catch but
has killed more than 90 people worldwide. Experts say cooked poultry meat
is safe to eat.
The virus has spread from Asia to Africa, and experts fear poultry in more
regions around the world could soon be infected.
Local sources said about 80 per cent of the turkeys at the French farm, in
a region famous for the quality of its chickens, had died. The remaining
birds were culled.
French prime minister Dominique de Villepin has announced an aid package
for the sector worth 52 million euros. He travelled to Lyon on Friday,
where authorities held a bird flu simulation exercise focused on the
potential arrival of infected people on a plane from a bird flu-hit region.
France has permission from the EU for a limited vaccination programme in
geese and ducks in 3 departments in the west of the country believed to be
at risk from migratory birds.
Bussereau said 2 of the departments had decided to opt for the confinement
of fowl rather than vaccination.

[2] France, domestic fowl (turkeys)

The spread of the H5N1 strain of bird flu made a worrying new advance
yesterday with a probable outbreak in a large turkey farm in eastern France.
More than 11 000 turkeys were slaughtered at the battery farm near
Versailleux in Ain after a form of H5 bird flu began to spread rapidly
through the flocks. Tests were continuing last night to decide whether or
not the birds were infected with the H5N1 strain but this seemed highly
likely. [Already confirmed, as reported in item 1 above].
The farm, in the Bresse region, not far from the Swiss border, is close to
lakes where 2 wild ducks have died from the virulent form of avian flu in
recent days. 7 new cases of H5N1 among dead swans [species?!] in the same
area were confirmed yesterday.[An official notification is anticipated].
One of the worrying aspects of the outbreak -- the 1st in a poultry farm in
Europe -- is that the afflicted turkeys were kept permanently under cover.
Veterinary officials said that they must have been infected indirectly
through wild bird droppings brought into the poultry houses, on bedding
straw or on boots.
The Bresse region is one of the chief poultry-rearing areas of France, the
largest producer and exporter of poultry in Europe. Poultry sales have
fallen by 30 per cent in France in recent weeks. French government
officials were at pains yesterday to point out that poultry was safe to eat
and there was no immediate reason to fear an outbreak of the disease among
humans. The owners of the turkey farm, M. and Mme Daniel Clair, and their
children and workers, have been placed under quarantine at home and a
surveillance zone has been set up covering 1/3 of the departement of Ain.
The disease -- which has killed 90 people in Asia -- can only spread to
humans through extensive contact with an infected bird. Fears of a
worldwide avian influenza pandemic which might kill millions are based on
the possibility that the deadly virus might eventually mutate in contact
with a human strain of flu. This is regarded as [possible] but not
inevitable. However, the sense of crisis and foreboding in France was
increased by the fact that -- by coincidence -- yesterday was the day
selected for a human bird flu "simulation exercise" in the city of Lyons,
70 miles from the turkey outbreak in Bresse.
The prime minister, Dominique de Villepin, was in Lyons for the exercise,
in which 2 "infected passengers" arrived at the airport from Asia and were
immediately placed in an isolation ward in a local hospital. Anti-flu
injections were then tested on volunteers.
Asked how avian flu could have infected turkeys which are kept indoors, M.
Villepin said: "We are studying very carefully what happened on this farm.
Depending on what we find, we may have to strengthen our security
recommendations."
Meanwhile Bernard Vallat, France's former chief vet -- now director general
of the World Organisation for Animal Health -- warned yesterday that the
H5N1 virus was now so endemic in migratory wildfowl that is was certain to
spread to almost every country in the world. The only possible exceptions,
he said, were Australia and New Zealand.
This contradicts British predictions in recent days that avian flu is
unlikely to come to the UK. Yesterday Slovakia confirmed its 1st cases of
H5N1 in 2 dead birds, while Germany announced the deadly strain had been
detected in wild birds in 2 more states.
M. Vallat also criticised the European Union for accepting French and Dutch
demands that poultry farmers should be allowed to vaccinate their birds,
which might mask the presence of the disease and make it harder to control

wild ducks were found dead on 13 Feb 2006;

investigation confirmed the infection by H5N1 (for France's official
notification, go to <http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_30.HTM#Sec17>).
As demonstrated in the past, and more recently during the H7N7 outbreak in
the Netherlands in 2003, the virus can spread by various means, including
mechanical, such as vehicles, utensils, people who may carry the virus on
their clothing or footwear, etc.
Dutch investigators also examined the possible role of pigs in the
epidemiology of H7N7. They concluded that swine in mixed herds with
infected poultry are at risk for introduction of avian influenza, subtype
H7N7, while swine in mixed herds with no infected poultry or swine in herds
with no poultry at all are at no significant risk for that subtype.
However, the possible contact between swine and infected wild birds was not
covered.
Obviously, other subtypes might have different characteristics. - Mod.AS]

[3] Cambodia, ducks, H5N1 return suspected

The deadly H5N1 bird flu virus has returned to Cambodia, found in dead
ducks near the border with Vietnam, a senior official government said on
Friday [24 Feb 2006].
"The dead ducks were found near a lake where wild birds live and test
results showed it is the H5N1 bird flu virus," Yim Vanthon, the number 2 at
the Agriculture Ministry, told Reuters.
The virus has killed 4 people in Cambodia since it first arrived in late
2003 and its reappearance was the first in months in a region experts
believed could generate a mutated virus which might trigger a global human
pandemic.
There had been no reports of new human infections since 3 ducks were found
dead 2 weeks ago in the Kampong Seim district of the eastern province of
Kampong Cham, about 50 miles (80 km) east of Phnom Penh, Yim Vanthon said.
The flock of more than 200 ducks had been culled and the government had
banned the movement of 10 000 ducks being raised near the 12 square km (4.6
square mile) lake, home to water fowl believed capable of spreading the
virus without falling ill.
The government of impoverished Cambodia was trying to persuade other duck
raisers in the area to kill their birds but could not afford to pay them to
do it, Yim Vanthon said. "Farmers are complaining about culling their
poultry without compensation. This is another problem for us," he said.
The reappearance was a jolt towards the end of the cool season, a time in
which the H5N1 virus seems to thrive best in this region, which had passed
without incident even as the virus spread rapidly to the Middle East,
Europe, Africa and now India.
Vietnam, the worst-hit country where the virus has killed 42 people, has
had no outbreaks since November 2005. Thailand, where 14 people have died
of bird flu, has gone 107 days without a reported fresh case.
Both countries have enlisted armies of volunteers to spread the word about
bird flu throughout countrysides where backyard chickens are the norm and
to act as an early detection system.
Vietnam inoculated its vast poultry flock before the cool season began,
worried that a virus which has killed 92 of the 170 people known to have
been infected might flare up again.
But the experts worry especially about Cambodia, still recovering from 3
decades of civil war and the Khmer Rouge, under whose radical
back-to-the-land rule an estimated 1.7 million people were killed, or died
of starvation and disease. Its veterinary service is rudimentary and its
people poor, many of them dependent on poultry for protein.
The main fear of the experts is that the virus will mutate into a form
which can move easily between people, which now it cannot. Almost all of
the known human cases have been people in close contact with infected fowl.

dates back to 24 Mar 2005 (see

[4] Hong Kong, wild birds

Health authorities in Hong Kong confirmed that 3 more birds had died from
the H5N1 strain of bird flu and said tests were under way on another
suspected case.
This brings to 13 the number of birds in the southern Chinese territory
known to have caught the bird flu strain that has claimed at least 90,
mostly Asian, human lives since late 2003 and has now spread to Africa and
Europe.
Preliminary tests on a 14th bird, a house crow found on Thursday [23 Feb
2006] in Shek Kip Mei in the Kowloon area, indicated a suspected case of H5
avian influenza, a spokesman from the Agriculture, Fisheries and
Conservation Department said.
The latest birds confirmed with H5N1 were a dead large-billed crow [_Corvus
macrorhynchos_; picture at
<http://www.avesphoto.com/website/pictures/CROJUN-1.jpg>] found in Kowloon
on Saturday and a munia [species?!] and a white-backed munia [_Lonchura
striata_, picture at <http://www.hkbws.org.hk/graphic/munia.html>]
discovered separately on Hong Kong island on Sunday.
10 birds had previously tested positive for the deadly strain, including 2
magpies found dead last week in the densely populated urban districts of
Mongkok and neighbouring Sham Shui Po. A law banning chickens and ducks as
pets came into force in Hong Kong on 13 Feb 2006 as the government stepped
up efforts to suppress a brewing bird flu outbreak.
Agriculture department staff have been searching homes in villages
throughout the territory's rural areas in what was expected to be a 6-week
programme to clear Hong Kong of an estimated 9000 chickens and 3500 ducks
kept in homes.
Hong Kong was the scene of the world's 1st reported major bird flu outbreak
among humans in 1997, when 6 people died of the then-unknown scourge. As
the virus was quickly traced to chickens and ducks, the outbreak prompted
the government to slaughter all the city's 1.5 million poultry.

We are grateful to Preben Willeberg for pointing out an error in
ProMED-mail's posting 20060224.0600, "Avian influenza - worldwide (30):
Europe, Asia, Africa". The error occurred in the section [4] FAO update,
worldwide", extracts from FAO-AIDE update, Avian Influenza situation, 23
Feb 2006, no.39.

The text included the following passage:
"Latest information on avian influenza
--------------------------------------
Many countries discovered HPAI H5N1 virus in their territories over the
past 2 weeks: Austria, Azerbaijan, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany,
Hungary, India, Italy, Greece, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria and Slovenia. In
addition, Bulgaria and Slovenia declared the presence of H5. In Romania,
the H5N1 virus moved from the Danube Delta area to the south, and was
reported in an area near the border to Serbia and Bulgaria."
We have been informed by the FAO that the inclusion of Denmark in the said
list was erroneous.
We are glad to bring this inforamtion to our subscribers: Denmark is not
included in the list of countries infected by HPAI H5N1 virus.
