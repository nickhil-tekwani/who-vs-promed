We report about West Nile virus (WNV) infections
in a symptomatic traveller returning from Israel
and in her asymptomatic travel companion.
Knowledge of the current epidemiological
situation in Israel from where WNV cases were
reported recently enabled a rapid diagnosis. The
described cases serve as a reminder for
physicians to consider WNV in the diagnosis of
patients returning from areas with potential circulation of the virus.

At the end of July 2010, a Dutch woman in her
early 30s presented to our 1st aid department
with fever, retro-orbital headache and a macular
rash. The day before she had returned from a
10-day holiday to Israel where she noticed
several mosquito bites during a camping trip at
the Sea of Galilee. There was no history of tick
bites. 5 days before presentation, she had
suddenly fallen ill with extreme fatigue,
myalgia, fever and an increasingly severe
headache. Movement of the eyes had been painful.
The next day she had developed a burning
sensation of the skin that was followed by a skin
eruption. The rash started on the trunk and spread to arms and legs.

Upon presentation in the 1st aid department she
did not appear ill. Body temperature was 36.4°C
[97.5 F]. There was a generalised macular rash,
sparing hands and feet, and no petechiae or
eschars were present. Neurological examination
revealed no abnormalities. Potential infection
with West-Nile virus was suspected because of the
clinical picture and recent reports of West Nile virus cases in Israel.

Laboratory examination showed a leukopenia of
1.8x109/L with a predominance of large granular
lymphocytes; thrombocyte count was 92x109/L.
Infection with Epstein Barr virus,
cytomegalovirus, dengue virus, enterovirus and
parechovirus was excluded by serology and antigen
test or PCR. A lumbar punction was not performed
due to missing neurological symptoms. West Nile
virus RNA could not be detected in the EDTA
plasma sample taken on day 5 after onset of
disease by a TaqMan reverse transcriptase-PCR
assay, using a probe for the WN3NC. However, in
a 2nd blood sample obtained 15 days later,
seroconversion for both serum IgG and IgM
antibodies against West Nile virus was detected
with an indirect qualitative enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Focus Diagnostics,
Cypress, California). This assay uses antibody
capture technique for the detection of IgM antibodies.

Once the diagnosis was confirmed, serology was
performed in the patients travel companion who
reported having had similar complaints, but who
had already recovered by the time he returned to
the Netherlands. The laboratory results showed
that he was seropositive for WNV IgG and IgM.
Recovery was uneventful in both patients.

West-Nile virus is endemic in Israel. The largest
recent outbreak in humans in Israel occurred in
the year 2000 with more than 400 reported cases.
Recently, 12 cases of West Nile fever have been
reported, centered around the Tel Aviv area.
_Culex perexiguus_, _Cx. pipiens_, and _Aedes
caspius_ are the vectors of West Nile virus in
Israel where most cases of West Nile fever occur
between August and October. The seasonal
occurrence of human cases reaches a peak one month after the mosquito peak.
