Khartoum's Al-Sudani daily newspaper reported Tuesday [23 Oct 2012] that 6 people died of and 10 others are infected with unknown fever in various areas in Sudan's South Darfur state.

"Unknown fever appeared in various areas of the state and infected 16 people on Saturday and Sunday [20-21 Oct 2012], and 6 of them died," the paper quoted Hassan Mohamed Abul-Hassan, a local official in the state, as saying.

"As soon as we received reports on the cases, we have contacted the federal Ministry of Health," he said, noting that medical teams have been sent to these areas to investigate the cause of the fever and provide treatment for the infected people.

The local official further said that samples have been taken from the infected people and sent to Khartoum but that the test results have not come out yet.

[In the absence of additional information on the clinical presentation of the cases other than fatalities from a febrile illness it is hazardous to attempt to speculate a differential diagnosis at this time. The range of possible diagnoses includes diseases of viral, bacterial, and parasitic origin. With the current ongoing outbreaks of Marburg virus disease in Uganda and Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it is tempting to consider a viral hemorrhagic fever as the etiology of a fatal febrile disease outbreak in Sudan, but not casting the diagnostic net further at this point seems potentially hazardous at best.

Earlier this month (October 2012), ProMED-mail carried a report of an undiagnosed fatal illness outbreak occurring in Zalingei, Central Darfur state. In that report, the description was "most of the victims of the unknown fever are Arab nomads and gold excavation workers. ...the patients suffer from headaches, vomiting, and fatigue". A similar report on that same outbreak carried a few days later on ReliefWeb mentioned there were 7 deaths, and attributed them to poor access to good health care and medications in the region. There was mention of specimens having been sent to Khartoum for testing as well. (http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/seven-die-unknown-fever).

Searching maps for locations, the 1st report above refers to deaths occurring "in various areas of the state [South Darfur]." The earlier report refers to the deaths occurring in the "area of Korley, south of Zalingei." Looking at a March 2012 map of Sudan available on Relief Web (http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/sudan.pdf) and looking at a map showing the location of Zalingei, the capital of Central Darfur state http://www.myweather2.com/City-Town/Sudan/ZalingeiInDarfur/map.aspx, one sees the proximity of the states, it is tempting to wonder whether the 2 outbreak reports might be related events, as the descriptions on both news reports seem similar. Again, this may well be a hazardous speculation as transportation is significantly challenged in these areas.

We await more information from knowledgeable sources in the region.
