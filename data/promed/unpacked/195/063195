Dracunculiasis:
Sudan accounted for 33% of the world's cases in 1994, 50% in 1995 and 78%
in 1996. Most cases are reported from Bahr El-Ghazal and Central states
(Ethiopian and Central African Republic borders), with peak rates during
April to November. 2,447 cases were identified in 180 villages during
1992; 2,984 (249 villages) in 1993; 53,271 (779 villages) in 1994 (35.8%
from West and North Bahr Al-Ghazal and 26.1% from Eastern Equatoria);
64,608 (1,932 villages) in 1995; 118,578 (5,466 villages, 5,353 of these in
the south) in 1996 - 77.6% of the world's total.

Onchocerciasis:
The disease is common in the southern and eastern regions, Bahr el Ghazal,
Blue Nile, Darfur, Kassala and the Upper Nile. Prevalence rates [Sudan
overall, I presume - Mod.ES of approximately 2% are reported (10% to 40%
in the southern region).
