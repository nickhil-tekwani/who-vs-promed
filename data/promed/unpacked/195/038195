Displaced people in a camp near Nyala, South Darfur, complained again about the outbreak of malaria among the camp residents. Because of a lack of medicines, prices soar in the pharmacies.

A Sheikh in the camp told Radio Dabanga that "not a single home in the camp is free of someone infected with malaria." He explained that the ill and their families are directed by the health centres to buy their medicines from the pharmacies, because they are running short.

"The majority of the displaced people have no money to buy medicines," he said, appealing to the authorities and humanitarian organisations to provide medicines to the camp.

In the beginning of November [2015], the Sheikh reported that the number of mortality cases was on the rise because of malaria and overpriced medicines.

[Malaria is endemic in the area, which is well known. The present crisis is due to lack of appropriate drugs for treatment and lack of prevention, primarily distribution of insecticide impregnated bed nets. Thus, the malaria crisis in the refugee camps is caused by lack of resources both from national authorities and international organizations. ProMED-mail reported earlier (2014, see below) that outdated and counterfeit medicines were circulating in the camps, but now it seems that there are no drugs at all. Circulation of counterfeit and outdated medicine is also a symptom of failure of national authorities to control the drugs circulating in the country. - Mod.EP
