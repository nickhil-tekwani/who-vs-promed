Democratic Republic of Congo declared a yellow fever epidemic in 3 provinces including the capital Kinshasa on Monday [29 Jun 2016] after confirming 67 cases of the disease, with another 1000 suspected cases being monitored.

Health Minister Felix Kabange said that 7 of the proven cases were autochthonous, while 58 were imported from Angola, where the outbreak began [and continues - Mod.TY].

A further 2 cases came from remote forested areas not linked to the current outbreak. Five people in total have died, Kabange added. [This appears to be an unusually low number of fatalities for 67 confirmed cases. One would expect 3 times that number of deaths. - Mods LM and TY].

"I declare today [20 Jun 2016] a localized epidemic of yellow fever in the provinces of Kinshasa, Kongo Central and Kwango," Kabange told a news conference.

Kinshasa is the main concern for global healthcare officials, because it has a densely packed population of more than 12 million and poor health infrastructure.

Yellow fever is transmitted by the same mosquitoes that spread the Zika and dengue viruses, although it is a much more serious disease. The "yellow" in the name refers to the jaundice that affects some patients.

The global stockpile of yellow fever vaccines has already been depleted twice this year [2016] to immunize people in Angola, Uganda and Congo. It currently stands at 6 million doses, but this may not be enough if there are simultaneous outbreaks in multiple highly populated areas.

Almost 18 million doses have been distributed for emergency vaccination campaigns so far in the 3 African countries. The current method for making vaccines, using chicken eggs, takes a year.

World Health Organization advisers have recommended using 1/5th of the standard dose of yellow fever vaccine in the event of a global shortage, enough to immunize temporarily but not to give lifelong immunity.

Manufacturers of the vaccine include the Institut Pasteur, government factories in Brazil and Russia, and French drug maker Sanofi.

Congo's outbreak, since January [2015], comes at a time when political tensions linked to an upcoming presidential election and an economic crisis caused by a commodity slump are already putting a huge strain on the country's stability.

[The numbers of laboratory-confirmed yellow fever (YF) cases have increased from 57 on 8 Jun 2016 to 67 cases in 2 weeks. The occurrence of 1000 additional suspected cases is of serious concern. The region bordering Angola needs to have active surveillance and vaccination because of the human cross-border movement from Angola, where active YF virus transmission continues. Of particular concern is evidence of local transmission in Kinshasa, where conditions would make it extremely difficult to stop an outbreak, assuming that adequate vaccine supplies were available, which is questionable. - Mod.TY
