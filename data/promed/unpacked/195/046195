"During the last phase of the vaccination campaign organised at Gouro (near the Libyan border) on 11 to 15 Dec 2012, unusual reactions were noted," Health Minister Mamouth Nahor NGawara told AFP.

The health ministry sent the children to 2 hospitals in the capital NDjamena and then flew 7 of them to Tunisia "for further exams and more specialised care," N'Gawara added, saying that "their state of health is not worrying." Some of the children began to moan shortly after receiving their meningitis shot and then went into convulsions, said a former lawmaker from Gouro, Ahmat Saleh Bodoumi. International experts have been in the country since 9 Jan 2013 to investigate, the health ministry said in a statement.

Meningitis outbreaks are frequent in the poor, landlocked Sahel country. "During the past 15 years, Chad has recorded more than 50 000 cases of meningitis with more than 5000 deaths," N'Gawara said.

[Numerous cases of meningococcal meningitis are reported in the sub-Saharan African region known as the "meningitis belt" each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June
(http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx). A map of the African bacterial meningitis belt can be found at http://www.medic8.com/images/map4-9.gif. Chad is located in the middle of this "meningitis belt." Epidemics of meningitis in the African "meningitis belt" are mostly associated with the meningococcus. Mass immunization programs with meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine are recommended as a control measure in meningococcal outbreaks. Therefore, the adverse reactions, namely "seizures" in this case, after a "meningitis shot" reported above presumably occurred after receipt of a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine, although this is not specified as such in the news release.

There are 2 kinds of meningococcal vaccine: 1) Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV) and 2) Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV). Adverse events after meningococcal vaccination consist primarily of local reactions, such as redness or pain, at the site of administration in as many as half the people who get meningococcal vaccines, and occur more commonly after MCV than after MPSV (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm#mening). A small percentage of people who receive the vaccine develop a low-grade fever.

A more serious condition, Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) occurring up to one month after vaccine administration has been reported after administration of quadrivalent MCV. As of 15 Feb 2008, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has received 26 confirmed case reports of GBS within 6 weeks of receipt of the quadrivalent MCV Menactra out of more than 15 million doses of this vaccine being given.

In some children, having a fever can bring on a seizure. Febrile seizures can occur when a child has a fever from any cause, be it an infection or a febrile reaction to a vaccination. Febrile seizures usually last a minute or 2. They are most common with fevers reaching 102 deg F (38.9 deg C) or higher but can also occur at lower temperatures or when a fever is going back down. About 2-5 percent of young children will have at least one febrile seizure. Most febrile seizures occur in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. Such events have been reported to occur at a very low level following vaccines, most notably following measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) and the whole cell pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, (DTP) vaccine, which is no longer used in the United States.

Only one report of a seizure-like reaction after administration of a meningococcal vaccine could be found on a brief survey on the Internet (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/05vol31/dr3111b-eng.php). In this report, the "seizure" occurred soon after receipt of meningococcal quadrivalent polysaccharide vaccine and was attributed to a "pseudoseizure conversion reaction."

Chad is a poor, landlocked country in central Africa. It is bordered by Libya to the north, Sudan to the east, the Central African Republic to the south, Cameroon and Nigeria to the south west, and Niger to the west. N'Djamena is the national capital of Chad. Gouro is a subprefecture in the Ennedi region (one of the 22 regions of Chad), located northeastern Chad (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chad_07_region_locator_map_2008-02.svg).

[The description of the event following the receipt of vaccine in the above newswire as "moan shortly after receiving their meningitis shot and then went into convulsions" is curious. As mentioned above, febrile seizures have been reported following receipt of vaccine, but the time frame tends to be within hours to 2 weeks following vaccination. More frequently, immediate type reactions to exposure to antigens tend to be allergic reactions, with the more serious presentation being an anaphylactic event. Other possibilities that might explain what occurred include the possibility of a contaminant introduced into the vaccine vial (locally or at the manufacturer) or the use of a different adjuvant or higher than usual concentration of adjuvant, which has been associated with an increased incidence of local as well as febrile reactions.

Of note, according to a WHO report, Chad and other African countries have recently been incorporating a new meningococcal A conjugate vaccine as part of their meningitis vaccination program activities. (available at: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/)

ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information from knowledgeable sources on results of the investigations into the above mentioned vaccine associated adverse events, including information on the timeline from receipt of vaccine to event, as well as a description of the events that occurred and the numbers of affected children, ages of affected children and geographic locations of the events (all affected children were from same or different health facilities). In addition, more information on the actual vaccine used in the vaccination program (?conjugated) would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
