Date of confirmation of the event: 23 May 2018
Reason for notification: first occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: low pathogenic avian influenza [LPAI] virus
Serotype: H5
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Arlov, Arlov, Burlov, Skane Lan
Date of start of the outbreak: 23 May 2018
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 8600 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: A detection of LPAI has been done in a breeding farm of pheasants for restocking of game. There have not been clinical signs of disease among the animals. The pheasants were tested in accordance with the Swedish surveillance programme for avian influenza in poultry by routine sampling of blood samples.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 0 / 0 / - / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: All necessary measures according to EU-Directive 2005/94 are/will be applied including the euthanising and destruction of all birds, cleaning and disinfection of all the premises. A restricted zone of 1 km [approx. 0.6 mi] around the holding is established.

Control measures
Measures applied: zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability; official destruction of animal products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; stamping out; disinfection

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Institute (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / virus sequencing / 23 May 2018 / Positive
Birds / real-time PCR / 23 May 2018/ Positive

Future reporting

[The active surveillance program in Sweden shows its effectiveness in detecting AI virus and the importance of such early detection to allow proper preventive and response measures to be implemented.

Avian influenza viruses are divided by subtypes, based on 2 proteins found in the viruses: a hemagglutinin, or "H" protein, and a neuraminidase, or "N" protein. There are 16 H types and 9 N types yielding a total 144 possible combinations.

The H5 and H7 subtypes are of particular concern, given the ability of these 2 H-types to mutate from low pathogenic to highly pathogenic strains. These 2 H-types have been known to cause serious disease and mortality in domestic poultry http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/fact-sheet/eng/1356193731667/1356193918453.

"Most AI virus strains are low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) and typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.

"To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions in the farm. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough cleaning and disinfection, the area must be clear of organic material."https://goo.gl/cZSuAZ. - Mod.CRD
