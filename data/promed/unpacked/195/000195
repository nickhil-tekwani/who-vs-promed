An outbreak of _Escherichia coli_ at a nursery in Scotland has led to 28 cases of the infection in the East Lothian area. Church Road Pear Tree Nursery in Haddington has been closed as health authorities investigate the outbreak, which has led to some people being admitted to hospital. Most cases are said to be mild, with those in hospital in a stable condition. Another nursery in the town, called Meadowpark Pear Tree, has also been closed as a precaution after people connected with it reported symptoms of the infection.

What is _E. coli_ and why is it dangerous?
------------------------------------------------
- Infections can occur after coming into contact with the feces of humans or animals, or by eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water.
- Symptoms include bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, and vomiting.
- In rare cases, sufferers can develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This is a condition in which there is an abnormal destruction of blood platelets and red blood cells.
- No treatment currently exists to treat these infections. They usually disappear within a week, but medical professionals recommend resting and drinking fluids to help prevent dehydration and fatigue.

NHS Lothian has said a specific source is yet to be identified, but that advanced microbiological testing is being carried out to identify the strain of the infection and any links. So far, cases have been confined to the nursery, households of the children, and their close contacts.

Dr Richard Othieno, chairman of the Incident Management Team, said: "We know that this will be an anxious time for many of those who are directly affected by the infection. We have written to parents and carers of the children affected and to staff at the nursery to provide the most up-to-date information and ongoing health advice. NHS Lothian has a robust surveillance system in place to identify _E. coli_ cases which helped us to identify these cases early and put in place essential control measures to prevent further spread. This outbreak reinforces the importance of washing hands regularly, particularly before eating or preparing food, and after going to the toilet. We continue to provide support to the nursery and those parents and care givers who have been directly affected. We have encouraged parents to keep their children away from other children and those at higher risk until their negative results have been received."

The NHS states: "Anyone who has had an _E. coli_ O157 infection should stay away from work or school until they have been completely free of symptoms for 48 hours. Most people are no longer infectious after about a week, although some people, particularly children, may carry _E. coli_ O157 for several months after they have got better."

[The end of post suggests that the strain of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ involved is the prototype one, O157:H7.

Enteric infections including EHEC can spread easily in the childcare setting. Infections with _E. coli_ that produce Shiga toxin, the prototypic strain being O157:H7, can result in bloody, usually non-febrile, diarrhea that may progress to kidney failure and breakdown of red blood cells related to the toxin's effect on the kidney. The use of antibacterials in the early stages of the infection can increase the risk of complications, especially hemolytic uremic syndrome.

Evaluation of asymptomatic children in the setting of an EHEC outbreak in the daycare setting can be an important part of control:

Abstract
--------
"Objectives
Control measures for enteric outbreaks in childcare settings frequently include screening by stool cultures from symptomatic children only. We present evidence from an investigation of _Escherichia coli_ (_E. coli_) O157:H7 in a daycare in Waterloo, Ontario, to support implementation of a mandatory screening policy for all children during an outbreak.

"Methods
In addition to routine outbreak control measures employed by the health unit, stool samples from all children and staff were collected, with positive _E. coli_ cultures typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We conducted a cohort study, using data from the environmental investigation and questionnaires administered to parents and staff, to look for risk factors for infection and to survey parent/staff knowledge regarding appropriate management of diarrhea.

"Results
Overall, 11 _E. coli_ O157:H7 cases were identified (7 lab confirmed); 9 were children. No common source of infection was identified. Factors identified as possibly contributing to person-to-person transmission within the daycare included: i) the underreporting and possible attendance of symptomatic children despite alerting parents to the outbreak and requirements to keep symptomatic children at home, ii) possible transmission from an asymptomatic infected child, and iii) inconsistent understanding among parents and staff regarding diarrhea and appropriate management of a child with diarrhea.

"Discussion/conclusion
This investigation reveals that in childcare settings, _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak screening policies based on reported symptoms only may be insufficient. We recommend that such policies be amended to include the collection of at least one stool culture from all children in attendance, regardless of symptom history."
