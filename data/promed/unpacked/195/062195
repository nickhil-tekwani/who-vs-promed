I would like to report a large epidemic situation in the southwest of
France involving _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7.

9 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome and cases of bloody diarrhea
have been hospitalized in different hospitals of this region during
the month of October 2005. The Institut National de Veille Sanitaire
(InVS) has identified O157:H7 in 2 cases. It was then found that each
child had eaten steaks [actually steak hache, chopped steak - Mod.LL]
bought in many LeClerc supermarkets in this region. All of the meat
came from the same producer, Chantegrill. The epidemiological
investigation identified 3 batches of frozen minced beef, which have
been recalled. A national alert in the media has warned the
population about the situation.

[ProMED thanks Yves-Marie Ducrot, a medical student, for alerting us
to this cluster.

Based on my rough translation of the above source document in French,
this ongoing outbreak was 1st recognized on 25 Oct 2005, when InVS
was informed by a pediatrician from the hospital complex of Pau and a
pediatrician from the hospital complex of Bordeaux of 5 cases of
hemolytic uremic syndrome in children residing in the Pyrenees
Atlantiques and the Moors areas of southwest France.

_E. coli_ O157:H7 is found throughout the world and is certainly
known in France, as this reference -- Duffell E, Espie E, Nichols T,
et al: Investigation of an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157 infections
associated with a trip to France of schoolchildren from Somerset,
