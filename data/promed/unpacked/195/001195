Banff on alert after disease found in elk Saskatchewan cases the 1st in Canada
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Banff National Park officials are keeping close
tabs on the local elk population after the 1st
cases of chronic wasting disease [CWD] in wild
elk showed up in Saskatchewan. Deer in Alberta
and Saskatchewan have tested positive for the
disease -- a fatal brain illness of mule deer,
white-tailed deer and elk. But officials in
Saskatchewan report this is the 1st time it has
been found in wild elk in Canada.

Jesse Whittington, wildlife specialist for Banff
National Park, said CWD is one of the most
important diseases that Parks Canada monitors
for, and has been doing so for several years now.
"It's definitely on our radar. It's been along
the eastern boundary of Alberta for the last
couple of years, so we've known there was a
possibility it could show up in elk," he said.
"Chronic wasting disease has the potential to
have large effects on our wildlife populations,
so we continually test for this disease."

Whittington said Parks collects the brain stems
from all dead elk, deer, and moose they find in
the park and send the samples to veterinarians at
the Calgary Zoo for testing. "To date, we do not
have chronic wasting disease in Banff National
Park but given the risks associated with the
disease we will continue to monitor for it," said Whittington.

Chronic wasting disease is caused by an abnormal
protein molecule and is closely related to
scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform
encephalopathy in cattle and Creutzfeld-Jakobs
disease in humans. A fatal neurological disease
that can affect deer, elk and moose, the illness
develops slowly, taking close to 2 years or
longer for the animal to show signs of the disease.

The infection can remain unnoticed in the wild
for many years, but eventually infected deer and
elk cannot maintain body condition and slowly
waste away. Excessive salivation, tiredness, poor
co-ordination, trembling and drooping head and
ears are common signs of infection in advanced stages.

The disease has been present in the white-tailed
deer population in Saskatchewan since 2005. In
the U.S., it has been found in wild elk where elk
and mule deer overlap in ranges, but this is the
1st case in wild elk in Saskatchewan.

In early April 2008, 2 elk were found dead west
of Nipawin, in Saskatchewan's east-central
region. Both tested positive for chronic wasting
disease. It was believed they were in the early
stages of the disease and did not actually die
from it. The elk were females, aged 1-1/2 and
3-1/2 years old. The younger animal suffered
trauma consistent with being struck by a vehicle.
Only the head from the older animal was submitted
and therefore cause of death could not be determined conclusively.

[CWD is a transboundary disease as it is no
respecter of boundaries, whether they are
provinces or fences. If captive elk have had the
disease, it is likely at some point it will be
passed to wild cervids. Speculation is it may be
passed through urine which may explain its
transmission from captive to wild animals. - Mod.TG]
