Virus kills thousands of fish
-----------------------------
More than 5 tons of rainbow trout were destroyed at a fish farm following
confirmation of the virus [that causes] pancreatic necrosis.
Department of Agriculture scientists believe the virus may have been
brought to the province with a consignment of fish from Britain, where the
disease is endemic. Scientists say the disease has no implications for
human health.
Tests are being carried out on wild stocks of trout and salmon in
neighbouring rivers and lakes. However, anglers fear that the virus may
have already spread to wild stocks of fish in Lough Neagh. Newell McCreight
of the Ulster Anglers Federation said the virus posed a threat to salmon
and trout fisheries.
"The site where this occurred is in the upper reaches of the Sixmilewater,
which flows into Lough Neagh, so there is a real danger this could spread
and be harmful to indigenous fish stocks," he said.
Northern Ireland has been free of the virus since the last outbreak in
1996, and the Department of Agriculture has imposed movement restrictions
on the fish farm where the virus was found.
It can also be carried by fish showing no symptoms of the disease and the
virus can be transmitted through infected eggs, fish-to-fish contact,
infected water, equipment, or carrier fish.
The first sign of infectious pancreatic necrosis is fish swimming
erratically on their side in a spiral motion. They eventually die and fall
to the bottom. Mortality can be high, claiming between 30 and 40 percent of
infected stocks. Juvenile fish are particularly vulnerable.
The department said its policy was to ensure the province maintained its
high health status and remained free from serious fish diseases.
It is understood that part of the consignment of fish has been returned to
Britain, while the remaining fish have been destroyed.
However, Mr McCreight said the outbreak called into question the
importation of fish.
"If it is a question of fish eggs or juvenile fish being brought in from
the mainland, then I think that is an issue that needs to be looked at
seriously."

[The following information on Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis (IPN) is
derived from chapter 2.2.3. of OIE's Diagnostic Manual for Aquatic Animal
Diseases - 2000, where further information on its diagnostic procedures and
an extensive reference list can be found:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/A_00020.htm>
IPN is a highly contagious viral disease of young fish of salmonid species
held under intensive rearing conditions. The disease most
characteristically occurs in rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_), brook
trout (_Salvelinus fontinalis_), brown trout (_Salmo trutta_), Atlantic
salmon (_Salmo salar_), and several Pacific salmon species (_Oncorhynchus
spp._). Susceptibility generally decreases with age, with resistance to
clinical disease in salmonid fish usually being reached at about 1500
degree-days (value obtained by multiplying the age in days by the average
temperature in degrees centigrade during the lifespan), except for Atlantic
salmon smolts, which can suffer from disease shortly after transfer from
fresh water to seawater. The first sign of an outbreak in salmonid fry is
frequently a sudden and usually progressive increase in daily mortality,
particularly in the faster growing individuals. Clinical signs include
darkening pigmentation, a pronounced distended abdomen, and a
corkscrewing/spiral swimming motion. Cumulative mortalities may vary from
less than 10 percent to more than 90 percent depending on a combination of
several factors, such as virus strain and quantity, host, and environment.
The disease is transmitted both horizontally via the water route and
vertically via the egg. Surface disinfection of eggs is not entirely
effective in preventing vertical transmission.
The disease has a wide geographical distribution, occurring in most, if not
all, major salmonid-farming countries of North and South America, Europe,
and Asia. - Mod.AS]
