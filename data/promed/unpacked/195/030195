Further Comment on Possible Treatment of Smallpox by Elevated Temperature
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. William Baine in his proposal for treatment of smallpox by temperature
control stated the following: "The ceiling temperature of smallpox virus
[_Variola virus_ on chick allantoic membrane is 37.5-38.5 degrees Celsius.
The seasonal occurrence of smallpox...was highest during winter and early
spring." Is it possible that variola virus is a temperature sensitive virus
at clinically safe levels of fever? Smallpox is a febrile illness, but
would maintaining skin temperature (in addition to core temperature) at 39
to 40 degrees C be a useful adjunct to other therapy? [See ProMED-mail post
Smallpox, bioterrorism response plan - USA (03) 20011130.2913
Drs. Fenner and Henderson address this very issue in their book (1). What
they say is the following: "As outlined in Chapter 2, determination of the
ceiling temperature of viral replication is a useful laboratory method of
distinguishing between certain orthopoxviruses and between variola major
and certain strains of variola minor virus. In animal models, body
temperature has a dramatic effect on the severity of the leporipoxvirus
disease, mysomatosis (Marshall, 1959), and mice housed at 2 degrees C are
about 100 times more susceptible to mousepox than those maintained at 20
degrees C (Roberts, 1964)."
"There is no evidence that raised body temperature affected the progress of
variola major; severe cases (flat-type and haemorrhagic-type smallpox) were
often associated with higher temperatures than those found in ordinary-type
smallpox. However, Dumbell & Wells (1982), comparing variola major and
alastrim (variola minor) viruses, found that many fewer virions of alastrim
(variola minor) virus (which had the lower ceiling temperature) than of
variola major virus were released from infected cells when the temperature
was raised. The decreased dissemination of virus could act in concert with
developing immunity to reduce the severity of variola minor."

A Similar Comment and a Useful Reference
----------------------------------------
I also lack any clinical experience with smallpox, but I've been reading
"Smallpox and its Eradication" by Fenner, Henderson, Arita, Jezek and
Ladnyi, published by WHO in 1988 (and available full-text through the WHO
website). [The link to this publication is
<http://www.who.int/emc/diseases/smallpox/Smallpoxeradication.html> -
Mod.CP.
These authors give some information that may bear on the question of
temperature sensitivity of variola virus. In tables 2.3 and 2.9, (pgs 87
and 113, respectively) "ceiling temperatures" are listed as an aid to
distinguishing various orthopoxviruses in the laboratory: variola 37.5-38.5
degrees C, vaccinia 41 degrees C, monkeypox 39 degrees C and cowpox 40
degrees C. Elsewhere in the text, it is made clear that the virus can
withstand these temperatures for a time, which greatly facilitated the
acquisition of adequate samples from suspect cases in tropical climates.
More to the point, on pg 164, it is stated: "There is no evidence that
raised body temperature affected the progress of variola major; severe
cases (flat-type and haemorrhagic-type smallpox) were often associated with
higher temperatures than those found in ordinary-type smallpox."
However, Dumbell & Wells (1982), comparing variola major and alastrim
(variola minor) viruses, found that: "Many fewer virions of alastrim
(variola minor) virus (which had a lower ceiling temperature) than of
variola major virus were released from infected cells when the temperature
was raised. The decreased dissemination of virus could act in concert with
developing immunity to reduce the severity of variola major."
Perhaps there are more recent investigations that relate to this question
(any virologists care to comment?), but I commend this book to all for an
excellent historic (and heroic) perspective.

Treatment of Syphilis by Induction of Fever
-------------------------------------------
In the pre-antibiotic era was one of the treatments for syphilis not
deliberate infection with malaria, with the deliberate intent of inducing
treponemicidal fever?
Are there not some senior clinicians who recall this?

[These 3 comments add additional information, but do not resolve the
question about whether elevated temperatures would help with smallpox
infections. The role of fever in the resolution of infections remains a
subject for debate. - Mod.CP
