Cases of African swine fever [ASF] have been reported in the Rostock district (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania). Following the reported death of several pigs in a fattening farm, the State Office for Agriculture, Food Safety and Fisheries examined initial samples. A PCR test led to the suspicion that the animals were infected with the ASF virus. Further investigations by the Friedrich Loeffler Institute [FLI] have now confirmed the suspicion, as reported by the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL).

Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has become Germany's 3rd federal state affected by ASF. Previously affected federal states are Brandenburg and Saxony; almost 2700 cases of ASF have been detected there by now, most of them in wild boars.

How the animal disease entered the fattening farm is currently unknown. The FLI will now also investigate the route of the pathogen's entry into the herd. The responsible authority onsite must now order that all animals in the herd are killed and harmlessly disposed of.

[The federal state Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania borders Poland, similarly to the 2 federal states affected earlier. However, the included Rostock district in its north does not share a border with Poland (see map at <tinyurl.com/6af93ne4> and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany).

This is a concerning northwestern leap of African swine fever [ASF] in Germany, a country that has, so far, been rather successful in its efforts to prevent ASF introduction into domestic pig farms (save one event; see ProMED post 20210721.8535569).

Further epidemiological information is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
