Lassa fever infection in Ghanaian troops serving in Sierra Leone
-----------------------------------------------------------------
ACCRA: A Ghanaian soldier [on peace-keeping duties in Sierra Leone
disclosed that 4 soldiers have been evacuated home as a result of
contracting Lassa fever. [He complained about the relatively poor
conditions and facilities available for Ghanaian troops. Some of his
colleagues, he said, have suffered from malnourishment as a result of an
over-reliance on gari [made from the manioc or cassava. He said Zambian
and Indian troops on similar missions in Sierra Leone enjoyed better
facilities. [Since Lassa fever virus is endemic in rodents in West Africa,
Ghanaian troops may have been at greater risk of infection than their
colleagues in the peace-keeping force. - Mod.CP
The soldier said that [although some Ghanaian soldiers infected with the
disease [had been evacuated to Ghana for further treatment, Lassa fever
treatment is available in Sierra Leone. He was not aware that the disease
had claimed the lives of any Ghanaian soldier serving in Sierra Leone. He
disclosed that an advance party of personnel of the Medical Corps have left
for Sierra Leone to take care of the health of troops serving there.

[ProMED-mail reported on the outbreak of Lassa fever in Sierra Leone last
year. This press report does not mention the dates of onset of illness
among Ghanaian soldiers in Sierra Leone. These cases may have occurred last
year or they may be more recent and indicative of a new outbreak.
Clarification would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP
