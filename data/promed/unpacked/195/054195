NEW DELHI, April 6.

According to top officials of the South-East Asia Regional Office of WHO,
incidents of [the Eurasian form of] Hantavirus infection, which causes
haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (kidney disease) [HFRS], have
already been reported from Myanmar and Sri Lanka, and antibody studies have
suggested that there (is) a wide circulation of the virus in India,
Indonesia and Thailand.
[Can WHO/SEARO or anyone else give references for these studies --
especially those in Mynmar & Sri Lanka? - Mod.JW]
