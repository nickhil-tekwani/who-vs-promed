[China: Newcastle Disease Virus Isolated from Outbreaks of Disease in Geese
--------------------------------------------------
Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an important avian pathogen, is considered
now to be sufficiently unique among paramyxoviruses to merit designation as
a single virus species, _Newcastle disease virus_ representative of a new
genus _Avulavirus_ in the subfamily _Paramyxovirinae_ of the family
_Paramyxoviridae_. All NDV isolates are categorized as 3 pathotypes
depending on the severity of disease caused, i.e., velogenic, mesogenic,
and lentogenic. The velogenic strains are highly pathogenic for chicken
and other fowl including pigeon. Generally, NDV strains are infectious for
waterfowl, such as geese and ducks, without causing overt clinical
symptoms. Waterfowl have shown strong resistance to NDV infections and they
act only as asymptomatic carriers of the virus.
For some time outbreaks of disease have been observed in geese in China
characterised by high incidence and mortality rates. In 1999 a virus was
isolated from one such outbreak in geese at a farm in Shanghai, where the
incidence and mortality rate of the disease in adult geese were 50-70
percent and 10-20 percent, respectively. The mortality rate in young geese
under 15 days of age was 100 percent. The virus isolate, designated as
SF02, was shown to be the causal agent of the disease outbreak.
Now Jian Zou, Songhua Shan, Nengtao Yao and Zuxun Gong have confirmed by
genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis that this virus is a novel
strain of the paramyxovirus Newcastle disease virus exhibiting a unique
host range and pathogenicity. A paper describing characterization of this
virus gas now been published under the title: "Complete Genome Sequence And
Biological Characterizations Of A Novel Goose Paramyxovirus-SF02 Isolated
In China" in Virus Genes 30:1, 13ï¿½21, 2005. At present 8 distinct genotypes
of NDV are recognised and sequence analysis placed the SF02 isolate in the
genotype VIIa group. Although clearly a member of the species _Newcastle
disease virus_, the SF02 virus is distinctive in its high pathogenicity for
waterfowl such as geese and ducks, unlike other NDV strains that are
pathogenic mainly for chicken and pigeons. The cleavage site of the F
protein of SF02 has the RRQKR amino acid sequence characteristic of
velogenic strains of NDV, but the determinant(s) of the altered
pathogenicity of the SF02 strain remain(s) to be established.
The genome of the SF02 strain shares 83 percent identity with the La Sota
vaccine strain of NDV, and it is possible that disease in geese may be
controllable by vaccination. - Mod.CP]
