The Nuristan Provincial Reconstruction Team [PRT] is fighting an outbreak
of rabies in the province's Titin Valley that has claimed the lives of 4
Afghan citizens, but they are not going at it alone. The PRT is getting
help from the Iowa National Guard's 734th Agri-Business Development Team,
which provided 300 doses of rabies vaccine. The vaccine will be used to
inoculate dogs in the area and will help avoid the slaughter of Titon
Valley's canines.

"We were going to have to go to the villages in the valley, and if we saw
any suspicious animals, we were basically going to have to put them down,"
said United States Navy Lt. Kyle N Burditt, a physician's assistant with
the PRT from Dodge City, Kansas. "We were going to end up killing a lot of
animals that wouldn't have to die if we didn't have this vaccine."

US Army Maj. Loren Adams from New Liberty, Iowa is the 734th ADT's
veterinary officer. One of his areas of expertise is veterinary public
health, and he provided technical advice to the Nuristan PRT, which does
not have a veterinarian on staff. According to Adams, vaccinating animal
populations is the only effective way to bring a rabies outbreak like the
one in Nuristan's Titon Valley under control. "It's really important that
we vaccinate the dogs," Adams said. "You can't kill your way out of a
rabies problem. There's just no way to kill them all, so vaccinating the
animals is really the way to go."

"We are trying to push out the vaccine to the local villages as soon as we
can, so we can quell those outbreaks and stop any more people from dying of
rabies in our area," Burditt said.

[One hopes that the 300 doses of rabies vaccine is sufficient to cover at
least 70 per cent of the dog population in the area. No mention is made of
the availability of post exposure treatment for people bitten by dogs.
There have been 2 previous reports of human rabies in Afghanistan posted on
ProMED-mail. The one in 1999 was particularly serious, with reports of
rabid dogs roaming parts of Kabul and 90 fatal cases in the month of May
1999 alone.
