Foot-and-mouth case reported in Taoyuan County
----------------------------------------------
A case of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) was discovered late last month
[August 2009] in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County, the agency in
charge of animal health reported Saturday [5 Sep 2009]. According to
the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine under
the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA), it received
information of the case on 25 Aug 2009, after a laboratory test
revealed the presence of FMD.

Bureau officials collected the test sample from a wholesale pork
market during a routine inspection, the bureau noted, and said it
reported the case to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) on
Friday after confirming that it had not affected other pigs [See
comment].

The bureau said that upon learning of the case, it immediately asked
the county's animal health authorities to take necessary measures at
the farm from where the pork originated to contain a possible spread
of the FMD virus. The tests included an on-the-spot health examination
of the pigs and getting samples for tests that all eventually proved
negative. At the same time, anti-FMD shots were given to pigs being
raised on 3 nearby farms as a preventive measure, the bureau explained.

Results later showed that all pigs being reared on farms in the
neighborhood are healthy. To stave off a fresh outbreak of the
epidemic in Taiwan, animal health authorities resumed vaccinations of
pigs aged 12-14 weeks -- which are vulnerable to FMD -- beginning
early last month.

Before the resumption of vaccinations, only sporadic FMD cases had
been reported from different regions to the bureau over the past 12
months, but the bureau decided to re-impose the practice in an effort
to make Taiwan an FMD-free country recognized by the OIE.

Until late last year, 90 percent of the pigs on 12 000 farms around
the country had stopped receiving FMD vaccinations, moving Taiwan
toward the zero-injection rate required by the OIE, COA officials
noted. With the inoculation measure back in place, the officials said
it will now take Taiwan several more years to achieve its goal of
becoming recognized as a country free from FMD.

Taiwan had been listed by the OIE as an FMD free member where
vaccinations are practiced until February 2009, when 2 FMD cases were
reported in Yunlin and Changhua counties. An OIE member must be free
of FMD and must not have vaccinated any pigs against the disease for a
period of at least 12 months to be declared FMD free.

FMD 1st broke out in Taiwan in 1997 after the virus was brought into
the country by pigs smuggled in from China. The bureau was forced to
mandate the vaccination of all pigs to curtail the spread of the
epidemic in Taiwan from that year onward.

Taiwan now raises only about 6.4 million pigs a year, mainly for local
consumption. The number represents a marked fall from the 12 million
pigs raised in the country at the industry's peak, when 7 million were
exported to Japan annually.
