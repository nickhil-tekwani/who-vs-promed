[The data reproduced below confirm the continuing waning of the outbreak of
West Nile virus infection in Canada. During the past 6 days there have been
only 6 new probable or confirmed cases of human infection, a single
confirmed dead bird, and no new equine cases or positive mosquito pools.
Hence the posting of the Canadian West Nile virus updates will cease. Any
new significant events (e.g. human deaths, extension of range, etc., will
be posted individually. - Mod.CP]

West Nile Virus Surveillance Data as of Mon 10 Nov 2003
-------------------------------------------------------
Human - cumulative data
-----------------------
As of Mon 10 Nov 2003 there has been a total of 1306 probable or confirmed
cases of human infection in Canada and ten deaths (an increase of 6 cases
and no deaths since Tue 4 Nov 2003). Saskatchewan remains the most severely
affected province with 767 probable or confirmed cases and 6 deaths
followed by Alberta with 269 confirmed cases and no deaths.
Province/No. probable cases/No. confirmed cases/No. of deaths/
Nova Scotia / 0 / 2* / 0 /
New Brunswick / 1* / 0 / 0 /
Quebec / 3 / 14 / 0 /
Ontario / 0 / 89* / 2** /
Manitoba / 106 / 35/ 2 /
Saskatchewan / 729 / 38 / 6 /
Alberta / 0 / 269 / 0
British Columbia 7* / 12* / 0 /
Yukon 1* / 0 / 0 /
Total 847 / 459 / 10
*Linked to travel outside of province
** 2 probable cases; death due to other causes
[The probable cases in British Columbia, New Brunswick and Yukon, and the
confirmed cases in Nova Scotia are considered to be travel-related and not
indigenous. The 2 fatal cases and one of the probable cases in Ontario are
considered to be travel-related and not indigenous cases.
In 2002, there were 416 probable or confirmed cases of human West Nile
virus infection in Canada and 21 deaths attributed to the virus. All the
deaths and most of the cases occurred in Ontario and Quebec, in contrast to
the situation in 2003 when few cases have been reported from Ontario and
Quebec, and overall considerably fewer fatalities. - Mod.CP]
Equines - cumulative data
-------------------------
As of Mon 10 Nov 2003, 445 presumptive or confirmed equine cases have been
reported; Nova Scotia (1), Quebec (8), Ontario (41), Manitoba (53),
Saskatchewan (162), Alberta (180).
[Since the previous update of Tue 4 Nov 2003, the number of presumptive or
confirmed equine cases of West Nile virus infection remains unchanged.
There have been no reports of new equine cases of West Nile virus infection
during the past 26 days. - Mod.CP]
Mosquitoes - cumulative data
----------------------------
As of Mon 10 Nov 2003, 578 pools of mosquitoes have tested positive; Quebec
(88), Ontario (134), Manitoba (290), Saskatchewan (35), Alberta (31).
[Since Tue 4 Nov 2003 the number of West Nile virus-positive mosquito pools
is unchanged. In contrast to the data for other animals, the greatest
number of West Nile virus-positive mosquito pools was recorded in the
province of Manitoba (50.2 percent), whereas relatively few were found in
Saskatchewan (6.1 percent) and Alberta (5.4 percent). There have been no
extensions of range. - Mod.CP]
Wild Birds - cumulative data
----------------------------
As of Mon 10 Nov 2003, the following test results by province have been
reported:
Province/ No. submitted for testing/ No.tested/ No. confirmed positive /
Newfoundland and Labrador/ 69 / 64/ 0 /
Prince Edward Island/ 273 / 254 / 0 /
Nova Scotia/ 967 / 909 / 17 /
New Brunswick/ 887/ 820 / 6 /
Quebec/ 2711 / 2576 / 846 /
Ontario*/ 1717/ 1484 / 242 /
Manitoba/ 924 / 826 / 133 /
Saskatchewan/ 1193 / 953 / 157 /
Alberta/ 1499 / 1482 / 232 /
British Columbia/ 1942 / 1913 / 0/
Yukon/ 14 / 13/ 0 /
Northwest Territories/ 23/ 21 / 0 /
Nunavut/ 3/ 3 / 0 /
*Note that in the Ontario count; after the 4th confirmed positive bird,
no further testing is carried out and the birds are listed as presumed
positive.
[The totals for Canada for 2003 so far are 12 222 birds submitted for
testing, 11 318 birds tested, and 1633 confirmed West Nile virus-positive.
In addition there were 3770 sightings of dead birds. This represents since
Tue 4 Nov 2003 an increase of 15 birds tested (a continuing decline) and 1
more bird confirmed West Nile virus-positive (compared with 296, 90, 11, 9,
and 4 in the 5 preceding weeks).
Overall these figures, indicating a further reduction in new human cases
and virus-positive wild birds, together with the absence of new equine
cases and mosquito pools, signify the imminent end of the outbreak,
coincident with the onset of colder weather. - Mod.CP]
