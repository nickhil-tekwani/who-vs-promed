The HCDCP [Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention] inform a laboratory confirmed case of infection with MERS-coronavirus [MERS-CoV] in a 69-year-old patient, a Greek resident of Saudi Arabia, who is hospitalized in stable condition.

The clinical picture of the patient was reviewed after arriving in our country on [17 Apr 2014] from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, because of prolonged fever for which [the patient] was [evaluated] at the district hospital. Due compatible clinical and epidemiological history of the patient was tested and found positive in 2 consecutive molecular tests in the Greek Pasteur Institute.

The HCDCP has taken all necessary actions to track and monitor the contacts of the patient both during the voyage to Athens, in cooperation with the Civil Aviation Authority, the Aerougeionomeio [?] and the airline, and during his stay in Greece in collaboration with the hospital inpatient [service], where they have done the necessary actions. All measures to prevent and control spread of the disease to safeguard public health in accordance with the guidelines of HCDCP, the European CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) have already been implemented. The patient with actions of the National Health Operations Centre (CERECO) is transferred to a special unit of respiratory diseases.

As already mentioned in our previous update (press release [3 Jun 2013]), the MERS-CoV is a new member of the family of coronaviruses, which in 2012 was recognized as pathogenic for humans. The coronaviruses include both viruses that cause the common cold, and that cause the syndrome SARS. This new virus has no direct relationship with any of the other known coronaviruses, but disease is accompanied by significant mortality.

Up through [17 Apr 2014], the WHO has announced there have been a total of 243 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV including 93 deaths. The most recent WHO information included information on 17 Apr 2014 concerning a traveler from Jeddah to Malaysia.

The Greek case is the 10th case of infection with MERS-CoV diagnosed in Europe (in 5 different European countries: United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy).

Up through today [17 Apr 2014], confirmed cases of the disease have presented with mainly acute respiratory infection with fever, cough, and dyspnea, it is of critical importance to highlight the need for the application of strict rules of infection control to prevent the spread of infection in the hospital environment.

The precautionary measures recommended for protection against MERS-CoV are those applicable to other viral respiratory infections, namely to avoid close contact with people who show symptoms of the disease (coughing, sneezing) and have recently traveled to areas at risk (Arabian Peninsula). It highlights the search prompt medical evaluation in travelers returning from the Arabian Peninsula and exhibit similar symptoms within 14 days of their arrival.

The HCDCP is constantly vigilant regarding any further incidents detection in hospitals in the country. Under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and the EU obligations of the country HCDCP has been updated through the Early Warning System (EWRS), the European CDC (ECDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO) about the incident and the steps taken in our country.

The HCDCP informs that in accordance with international epidemiological data and because they have taken in our country all appropriate public health measures, spread of the disease is not expected and there is no reason for concern for the general population.

[As stated in the above press release, this case represents the 10th case of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection diagnosed in Europe, with earlier cases having been confirmed in the United Kingdom (4), France (2), Germany (2) and Italy (1). All cases in Europe to date can be traced back to an association with infection in the Middle East (in the UK there were 2 cases that were contacts of someone who had been infected in the Middle East, and in France there was one case that was a contact of someone who had been infected in the Middle East.

We await further information on results of the epidemiologic investigation surrounding this case, including possible high risk exposures (other laboratory confirmed cases or possible exposure to animals such as camels), as well as results of contact tracing. Additional clinical information would also be appreciated as the report above just mentions a prolonged febrile illness.

MOH: Confirmation of 7 new MERS-CoV infections in Jeddah
--------------------------------------------------------
In the context of the work of epidemiological investigation and ongoing follow-up carried out by the Ministry of Health for the MERS-CoV, the MOH announces the registration of 7 new cases of the virus in Jeddah.

The 1st is a 64-year-old male resident who died.

The 2nd is a 44-year-old male resident who also died.

The 3rd is a 62-year-old citizen and the 4th is a 47-year-old citizen, both of whom are being treated in intensive care.

The 5th is a 52-year-old male citizen in stable condition.

The 6th and 7th are both 54 years old, and both are working in the health field, and both are asymptomatic.

170 samples have been checked during this period (since the last mention) and all were negative except the 7 mentioned above.

[The above reports of 7 new laboratory confirmed cases including 2 deaths brings the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia to 231 including 76 deaths. Of note, 2 of the newly confirmed cases are asymptomatic healthcare workers, 1 is in stable condition, 2 are seriously ill being treated in intensive care, and 2 died.

At present there have been a total of 50 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported from Jeddah since mid-March 2014, of whom 9 (18 percent) have died, 8 (16 percent) are seriously ill in intensive care, 12 (24 percent) are in stable condition, 1 (2 percent) was reported as "recovered" and 20 (40 percent) were asymptomatic (presumably diagnosed as part of contact tracing). 18 (36 percent) of the MERS-CoV infected individuals in this outbreak are in health care workers.

12 new MERS-CoV cases discovered by Abu Dhabi health authority
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Health Authority - Abu Dhabi (HAAD) has discovered 12 new cases of MERS-CoV, state news agency WAM reported last night [19 Apr 2014].

The latest cases tested positive for MERS-CoV during routine screenings and are all in hospital isolation.

They will not cause any risk to the public or other patients and are expected to clear the virus within 10-14 days with no treatment needed, said the WAM report.

The Ministry of Health (MoH) and HAAD are dealing with the situation with full transparency to ensure the public is aware of the developments.

HAAD confirmed that the current situation is not a public-health concern.

The authority, together with the MoH, has taken all necessary measures according to international standards and recommendations from the World Health Organisation (WHO).

The MoH stated that WHO confirmed the virus was not a concern for public health at the moment and the current situation does not require a travel ban to any country in the world, screenings at different ports, or any restrictions on trade.

Saudi Arabia yesterday [19 Apr 2014] reported 2 more MERS-CoV deaths, bringing the death toll to 76 since the virus appeared in the country in September 2012, reported WAM.

[4] Global overview - ECDC 17 Apr 2014
Date: Thu 17 Apr 2014
Source: ECDC Communicable Disease Threats Report (CDTR) [edited]
http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/communicable-disease-threats-report-19-april-2014.pdf


Since April 2012, 275 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 98 deaths, of acute respiratory disease caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have been reported by national health authorities. To date, all cases have either occurred in the Middle East, have had direct links to a primary case infected in the Middle East, or have returned from this area. The source of the virus remains unknown but the pattern of transmission points towards an animal reservoir in the Middle East, from which humans sporadically become infected through zoonotic transmission. Human-to-human transmission to close contacts and in hospital settings has occurred, but there is no evidence of sustained transmission among humans. MERS-CoV is genetically distinct from the coronavirus that caused the SARS outbreak.

Since the previous CDTR, 44 new cases have been reported in the Middle East. 30 cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia including 5 deaths and 14 cases, including one death, from the United Arab Emirates. In addition, the Philippines reported one case in a person recently returned from the United Arab Emirates. Malaysia also reported a case that later died, in a traveller recently returned from Saudi Arabia.

[Since the ECDC report was published on 18 Apr 2014 there have been additional cases reported from Saudi Arabia as well as the UAE and Greece, with the total number of laboratory confirmed cases approaching 300. With the major increase in reports of contact associated cases of MERS-CoV infection, the numbers are growing significantly as the case fatality rate (CFR) is dropping (see section [2] above showing the CFR in the Jeddah outbreak is 18 percent, with 40 percent of the reported MERS-CoV infected individuals found to be asymptomatic infections).

There has been additional media and social media chatter telling of individuals identified as suspected cases travelling from the Middle East to other countries, as well as an Arabic language media report mentioning a suspected case in Jordan, pending confirmation (http://www.jordanzad.com/index.php?page=article&id=156730, in Arabic). Clearly there is now a heightened awareness for MERS-CoV with the marked increase in reported laboratory confirmations in the past few weeks (and days). Perhaps the silver lining of this cloud will be an increase in epidemiologic investigations including case control studies to further define risk factors for disease transmission and the as yet elusive "proof" of the animal reservoir that serves as the nidus of infection for the species jump of this virus to human infections. - Mod.MPP]
