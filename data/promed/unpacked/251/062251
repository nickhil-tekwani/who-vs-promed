Greece Demands Salmonella Outbreak Probe
--------------------------
Premier Costas Simitis demanded Sat, 9 Aug 2003 that Olympic organizers
investigate a salmonella outbreak that infected the entire German rowing
team. 62 team members were infected, forcing the squad to withdraw from an
Olympic test event.
"The Athens 2004 organizing committee realizes the seriousness of the
issue," Marton Simitsek, an organizing committee executive director, said
at a news conference after the World Junior Rowing Championships. The
Health Ministry on Saturday said laboratory reports confirmed the salmonella.
The hotel housing the 80-member German team recently was cited for 13
"problematic situations" at its restaurant, the ministry said. Public
health inspectors were examining the hotel, the ministry added.
State-run TV reported that Simitis made his demand in a phone call to chief
2004 organizer Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki. The Development Ministry said
it was temporarily suspending the hotel's operating license.
"Although the specific incident could be characterized as an isolated one,
the state and Athens 2004 will take all necessary measures so such
an incident will not be repeated," Simitsek said.

[This outbreak demonstrates the danger of an entire athletic team eating at
the same restaurant. It would be interesting to know how many other cases
outside the rowing team were found. It is somewhat reminiscent of the
outbreak of hepatitis A affecting almost the entire Holy Cross University
football (American) team several decades ago. The outbreak was linked to a
contaminated water fountain on the practice field. - Mod.LL]
