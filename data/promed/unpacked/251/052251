[2] Nasal skin necrosis
Date: Tue 29 Sep 2015

Jaime R. Torres, Leopoldo G. Cordova, Victor Saravia, Joanne Arvelaez, Julio S. Castro. Nasal Skin Necrosis: An unexpected new finding in severe chikungunya fever.

Abstract
In Venezuela, 3 adult patients with virologically confirmed chikungunya fever, who developed extensive acute nasal skin necrosis early in the course of a life-threatening illness characterized by shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, are discussed. One patient survived and fully recovered. Nasal necrosis has not previously been associated with the disease.

[3] Virus in saliva
Date: Thu 8 Oct 2015
Source: PLoS ONE 10(10): e0139481. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139481 [edited]


Gardner J, Rudd PA, Prow NA, Belarbi E, Roques P, Larcher T, et al. Infectious chikungunya virus in the saliva of mice, monkeys and humans. PLoS ONE 10(10): e0139481. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139481

Abstract
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging, ordinarily mosquito-transmitted, alphavirus that occasionally produces hemorrhagic manifestations, such as nose bleed and bleeding gums, in human patients. Interferon response factor 3 and 7 deficient (IRF3/7-/-) mice, which are deficient for interferon alpha/Beta responses, reliably develop hemorrhagic manifestations after CHIKV infection. Here we show that infectious virus was present in the oral cavity of CHIKV infected IRF3/7-/- mice, likely due to hemorrhagic lesions in the olfactory epithelium that allow egress of infected blood into the nasal, and subsequently, oral cavities. In addition, IRF3/7-/- mice were more susceptible to infection with CHIKV via intranasal and oral routes, with IRF3/7-/- mice also able to transmit virus mouse-to-mouse without an arthropod vector. Cynomolgus macaques often show bleeding gums after CHIKV infection, and analysis of saliva from several infected monkeys also revealed the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus. Furthermore, saliva samples collected from several acute CHIKV patients with hemorrhagic manifestations were found to contain viral RNA and infectious virus. Oral fluids can, therefore, be infectious during acute CHIKV infections, likely due to hemorrhagic manifestations in the oral/nasal cavities.

Background (summarized)
Although the primary disease manifestations of CHIKV infections in humans are acute fever and rash and acute and chronic polyarthralgia/polyarthritis, hemorrhagic manifestations are occasionally seen (in around 2-4 percent of patients) in both infected children and adults. Clinical signs of hemorrhage in CHIKV patients include purpura (bruising), hematemesis (vomiting blood), melena (pathognomonic of upper gastrointestinal bleeding), epistaxis (nose bleed), petechiae (small red or purple spots on the skin), hematuria (blood in urine), and gingivorrhagia (bleeding gums). The latter was reported in around one percent of adults; however, in CHIKV-infected dental patients, an Indian study showed the incidence can be much higher (over 50 per cent).

Discussion (summarized)
To our knowledge, this study represents the 1st report showing that oral fluids/saliva from CHIKV infected animals and humans can contain infectious CHIKV. The presence of infectious virus in oral fluids of IRF3/7-/- mice was associated with high viraemia and overt hemorrhagic lesions in the nasal cavities. In cynomolgus monkeys, CHIKV was isolated from saliva on or near the peak viraemia, with gingival bleeding noted previously in 50 percent of infected animals. The presence of infectious CHIKV in the saliva of several acute human patients with hemorrhagic manifestations provides further support for the contention that CHIKV in saliva is associated with hemorrhagic lesions in the nasal/oral cavities during the viraemic period. The safety implications of infectious saliva are perhaps most relevant for dentistry. Bites from CHIKV infected individuals with hemorrhagic manifestations might also be considered potentially infectious; however, for mice, this appears to be restricted to mice deficient in IFNalpha/Beta responses [6], with saliva from wild-type mice testing negative.

One might, nevertheless, speculate that individuals with a diminished capacity to mount IFNalpha/Beta responses might be at increased risk of infection via mucosal surfaces. Such individuals include the elderly, neonates, HIV patients, asthmatics and perhaps diabetics.

Although the studies herein are hardly exhaustive, the lack of mouse-to-mouse transmission via aerosol is perhaps not surprising. Aerosol transmission of CHIKV has not been formally reported in the publically available literature. Suspected aerosol infections have been reported for CHIKV in humans; however, the circumstances were not described.

[The epidemiological significance of CHIK virus in saliva or nasal secretions is not clear. The hundreds of instances of imported cases of CHIK virus into countries where vector mosquitoes are not present have not resulted in documented instances of ongoing transmission in the absence of those vectors (excluding transfusion of blood products). Risk of aerosol transmission apparently is low. This moderator knows firsthand of an example of a case of apparent aerosol transmission in a research laboratory 50 years ago, before negative pressure laminar flow hoods became available. - Mod.TY]
