There have been 14 confirmed cases of viral meningitis in Perry
County in less than a month. Usually, experts say doctors only report
a couple of cases a year.
Viral meningitis is the less serious form of meningitis. Health
experts say it can be spread in a variety of ways: through water,
through saliva, mucus or fecal matter of an infected person. Right
now, they have not isolated a common cause among the 14 cases and say
they are working on it. In the meantime, they hope you wash your
hands frequently, don't eat or drink after one another [i.e. don't
share food and drink], and avoid swallowing water from pools, creeks
or lakes.
A mother in Perryville said her 8-year-old son was one of the 14
infected, and she immediately took him to their family doctor when he
began feeling nauseous and started vomiting. "They did a spinal tap
on him to draw out the spinal fluid and see what kind of meningitis
he had, and turns out, he had viral meningitis," she said. Her son
was treated at a Cape Girardeau hospital and is doing fine now, but
she was very worried while he was ill. "You always think of the worst
when you hear the word meningitis," she said. Her son is now back
home safe and sound.
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Perry County Memorial Hospital said
patients have been canceling their appointments for fear of
contracting the virus. She said to keep in mind that the virus is not
airborne, so please do keep your scheduled appointment.

[Meningitis is an illness in which there is inflammation of the
tissues that cover the brain and spinal cord. Viral or "aseptic"
meningitis, which is the most common type, is caused by an infection
with one of several types of viruses. In the United States, there are
between 25 000 and 50 000 hospitalizations due to viral meningitis
each year. The more common symptoms of meningitis are fever, severe
headache, stiff neck, bright lights hurting the eyes, drowsiness or
confusion, and nausea and vomiting. In babies, the symptoms may
include fever, fretfulness or irritability, difficulty in awakening
the baby, or the baby refuses to eat.
Viral meningitis is serious but rarely fatal in persons with normal
immune systems. Usually, the symptoms last from 7 to 10 days, and the
patient recovers completely. Bacterial meningitis, on the other hand,
can be very serious and result in disability or death if not treated
promptly. Often, the symptoms of viral meningitis and bacterial
meningitis are the same. For this reason, healthcare specialists
advise that whenever there is suspicion of meningitis in a child, a
doctor should be consulted without delay.
Many different viruses can cause meningitis. About 90 percent of
cases of viral meningitis are caused by enteroviruses, such as
coxsackieviruses and echoviruses. But herpesviruses and mumps virus
can also cause viral meningitis. There is no specific treatment for
viral meningitis other than supportive care. Enteroviruses are
transmitted by contact predominantly through direct contact with
respiratory and other secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal
mucus) of an infected person. The incubation period for enteroviruses
is usually between 3 and 7 days. Frequent and thorough hand washing
is the best protection from infection.
Outbreaks of viral meningitis are frequently indicative of fecal
contamination of food products, deficiencies in the supply of clean
drinking water or the inadequate treatment and disposal of sewage. In
the case of the Missouri outbreak, the source of the infection has
not been established so far.
