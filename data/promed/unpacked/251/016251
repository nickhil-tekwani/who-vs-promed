Test results of a dead deer in Westmont Borough were released Friday [12
Oct 2007] and confirmed that it died of epizootic hemorrhagic disease,
commonly called EHD, said Walter Cottrell, the state game commission's
wildlife veterinarian.

In late September 2007, the game commission said that a deer died of EHD in
the Seward and St Clair Township area of Westmoreland County, a few miles
to the west of the Johnstown suburb of Westmont.

There have been no other reports of sick deer or deer that have died from
the disease in Cambria County, Cottrell said. In Somerset, Franklin and
Washington counties, EHD has been found in cattle, but no mortalities were
reported in those cases. There have been no reports of EHD in deer in the
wild in Somerset or Franklin counties, he said. Cottrell said other
counties in which EHD has been confirmed in wild deer are Allegheny,
Beaver, and Greene.

On 11 Oct 2007, the state Agriculture Department said it had confirmed EHD
in farmed deer in Franklin County. Cottrell said EHD is a common but
sporadic disease in white-tailed deer populations of the United States and
is contracted by the bite of insects called "biting midges".

EHD cannot be contracted by humans, Cottrell said.
