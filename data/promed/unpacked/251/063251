In a follow-up on the measles outbreak in Madagascar, the outbreak case count has risen to 28 747 since early October [2018]. The vast majority of the outbreak cases have been reported in children. Of this total, 80 fatalities have been reported.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 55% of cases are either unvaccinated or of unknown vaccination status.

A total of 70% of health districts in all 22 regions in Madagascar have been affected. The health district of Antananarivo-Renivohitra is the most affected. While officials say the situation is improving, the risk of the outbreak spreading to the few remaining unaffected regions of the country remains.

Although the 1st phase of the reactive vaccination campaign progressed well (25 health districts from [14-18 Jan 2019], targeting 1.48 million children), there is still a shortage of vaccines and funds for response in those districts at risk, and funding gaps need to be filled for phases 2 and 3 of the campaign, planned for February through April 2019.

In addition, communication to prevent anti-vaccine rumors needs to be strengthened.

[The measles outbreak that has hit Madagascar since October 2018 continues to spread to children in a number of areas. There are now over 28 000 cases with 80 deaths. This might be the worst measles outbreak in the history of the country. The WHO report shows that Madagascar has had a history of big outbreaks of measles in 2003 and 2004.

Despite the fact that there is a vaccine for measles, outbreaks continue to hit several countries in the world, including Africa, causing the deaths of children. In African countries, the vaccine is part of children's vaccination schedules given at 9 months of age, with a booster at 14 months of age. Earlier reports showed that Madagascar had not yet introduced the 2nd dose of measles-rubella vaccines into the national immunization program. Aside from that, the coverage of the vaccination is only 58%, making some children vulnerable to the infection http://outbreaknewstoday.com/madagascar-measles-outbreak-tops-3000-since-october-46542/.

Some parents/guardians refuse to take their children for vaccination because there is a misconception that the measles vaccine causes other diseases, including autism. Other people also refuse to take their children for this particular vaccination for religious reasons. More needs to be done to make parents/guardians have confidence in vaccination.

In countries where there have been outbreaks of measles, health authorities have embarked on a vaccination campaign to reach out to those who might have missed it when they were young and even those who might have taken it. This might be the way to go for the health authorities in Madagascar. - Mod.YA
