[1] COVID-19 and Tuberculosis
Date: 15 Aug 2020

SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The 1st COVID-19 case was detected 10 Mar 2020 in Turkey, and as of 18 May 2020, 148 067 cases have been identified, and 4096 citizens have died.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a worldwide public health concern; incidence of tuberculosis (per 100 000 people) in Turkey was reported at 14.1 in 2018. During the pandemic, COVID-19 has been the main concern in every clinic, and as we discuss here, overlapping respiratory diseases may result in delaying diagnosis and treatment.

Methodology: There were 4605 respiratory samples examined between 23 Mar and 18 May 2020 for COVID-19 and 185 samples for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ in our laboratory. The Xpert Ultra assay was performed for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis; SARS-CoV-2 RNA was determined by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis in combined nasopharyngeal and deep oropharyngeal swabs of suspected cases of COVID-19.

Results: Both of SARS-CoV-2 and _M. tuberculosis_ tests were requested on clinical and radiological grounds in 30 patients. Here, we discuss 2 patients who were both COVID-19 and TB positive. One patient already diagnosed with tuberculosis became COVID-19 positive during hospitalization, and another patient suspected and treated for COVID-19 received a final diagnosis of pulmonary TB and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection.

Conclusions: We want to emphasize that while considering COVID-19 primarily during these pandemic days, we should not forget one of the "great imitators," tuberculosis, within differential diagnoses.

[2] COVID-19 Compared to Other Pandemic Diseases
Date: 15 Aug 2020

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/publication/32792043


In December 2019, the 1st cases of a new contagious disease were diagnosed in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China. Within a short period of time, the outbreak developed exponentially into a pandemic that infected millions of people, with a global death toll of more than 500 000 during its 1st 6 months. Eventually, the novel disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the new virus was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Similar to all known pandemics throughout history, COVID-19 has been accompanied by a large degree of fear, anxiety, uncertainty, and economic disaster worldwide. Despite multiple publications and increasing knowledge regarding the biological secrets of SARS-CoV-2, as of the writing of this paper, there is neither an approved vaccine nor medication to prevent infection or cure for this highly infectious disease.

Past pandemics were caused by a wide range of microbes, primarily viruses, but also bacteria. Characteristically, a significant proportion of them originated in different animal species (zoonoses). Since an understanding of the microbial cause of these diseases was unveiled relatively late in human history, past pandemics were often attributed to strange causes including punishment from God, demonic activity, or volatile unspecified substances. Although a high case fatality ratio was common to all pandemic diseases, some striking clinical characteristics of each disease allowed contemporaneous people to clinically diagnose the infection despite null microbiological information.

In comparison to past pandemics, SARS-CoV-2 has tricky and complex mechanisms that have facilitated its rapid and catastrophic spread worldwide.

[Most of the pandemics in the 20th and 21st centuries have either been caused by an influenza virus or a coronavirus. The 2003 SARS coronavirus pandemic had a much smaller impact than this current coronavirus pandemic and killed fewer than 1000 people.

The scale of the COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented with global impact on health systems, economies and continuity of life as we knew it previously. While on one hand, there are a lot of hard learned lessons, there have also been excellent examples of resilience, and dedicated efforts by health care, public health professionals and the community.

The current COVID-19 pandemic seems unlikely to be over any time soon, with various scenarios for the future estimating either several overlapping outbreaks or another ferocious wave later in 2020.

Historical evidence from influenza pandemics which occurred in the past century shows us that pandemics tend to come in waves over the 1st 2-5 years as the population immunity builds-up (naturally or through vaccination), and then the number of infected cases tends to decrease. This observation is the most likely trajectory for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. What should sound a note of caution for the world is that the 2nd wave of influenza pandemics by H1N1 (Spanish flu) and H3N2 in 1968 were also much more severe than the 1st one, potentially because the virus underwent mutations that increased its virulence.

The near future will require a transition to a new normal in which a combination of physical distancing, enhanced testing, quarantine, and contact tracing will be needed for a long time. - Mod.UBA]

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is beginning. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, face masks, hand washing and large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mod.UBA]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 15 Aug 2020.

Highlights
----------
- The International Narcotics Control Board, World Health Organization, and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime have released a statement calling on governments to ensure that the procurement and supply of controlled medicines in countries meet the needs of patients, both those who have COVID-19 and those who require internationally controlled medicines for other medical conditions.
- While several countries in the Americas have implemented innovative strategies to boost immunization programmes during the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about risk of exposure, as well as challenges accessing services during lockdown, have led to a reduction in vaccination coverage. This was shown in a series of surveys carried out by the WHO Regional Office for the Americas.
- Africa is marking 6 months since the 1st cases of COVID-19 were detected on the continent. Cases have been gradually increasing, with South Africa bearing the brunt of the crisis, with over half a million cases and 11 000 deaths.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 55.0% of the global newly reported cases and 77.6% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 11.2 million cases. Brazil reported 37.1% (60 091) of new cases, followed by USA 32.6% (52 799), Colombia 7.0% (11 286), Peru 5.8% (9441), Argentina 4.6% (7498), Mexico 4.5% (7371), and Chile 1.3% (2077).

- The European region reported 9.9% of the global newly reported cases and 3.6% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Spain reported 18.7% (5479) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Russia 17.2% (5061), France 9.1% (2667), Ukraine 6.3% (1847), Israel 0% (0), the UK 4.9% (1440), Romania 4.8% (1415), Germany 4.8% (1415), Kazakhstan 4.3% (1267), Turkey 4.2% (1226), Poland 2.8% (832), Uzbekistan 2.3% (690), and Netherlands 2.1% (636). While Russia's proportional representation has fallen, its daily absolute count of newly confirmed cases is basically stable; it's the increased reporting from other countries that causes the decrease in representation of Russia.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.5% of the global newly reported cases and 3.6% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 30.0% (4013) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 18.6% (2501), Saudi Arabia 10.3% (1383), Morocco 9.3% (1306), Kuwait 9.7% (699), Pakistan 5.6% (747), Palestinian Authority 3.9% (531), Lebanon 2.5% (334), Bahrain 2.4% (326), Libya 2.1% (277), and Qatar 1.8% (251). Cases are continuing to increase in Iraq and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a relative surge mode.

- The African region reported 3.6% of the global newly reported cases and 3.8% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 58.2% (6275) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ethiopia 9.6% (1038), Kenya 5.4% (580), Algeria 4.4% (477), Zambia 3.3% (358), Nigeria 3.1% (329), Ghana 2.0% (216), Cameroon 0% (0), Namibia 1.7% (182), Gabon 1.4% (148), Senegal 1.2% (132), and Madagascar 1.1% (121).

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.8% of the global newly reported cases and 0.44% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 73.8% (6134) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 16.4% (1360), Australia 4.6% (385), South Korea 1.9% (166) and Singapore 1.0% (83), China 0.84% (70). The Philippines, Japan, and Australia continue to have elevated transmission, and Viet Nam continues to report cases in the wake of the Da Nang outbreak, 19 reported in the past 24 hours.

- The South East Asia region reported 24.0% of the global newly reported cases and 10.8% of globally reported deaths. India reported 92.0% (65 002) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 3.9% (2766), Indonesia 3.2% (2307) and Nepal 0.84% (594). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries with resurgences associated with lifting of restrictions.

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (63 986), followed by USA (53 523), and Brazil (38 937) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (52.9%). There were 5170 deaths reported in the past 24 hours (14 Aug 2020).

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by USA, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Russia, South Africa and Philippines. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 4351 to 63 986. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Iraq, France, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Iran, Ukraine, Morrocco, Chile, and Saudi Arabia; their range of reported new cases is 1413 to 4293.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is virtually no change in average number of daily reported cases (an increase of 0.45%), and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is decreased by 4.4%. The key question still remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether these figures reflect reporting artifact seen surrounding weekends. Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (I haven't changed my mind! -- I feel like a broken record here...).

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; however, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing or case reporting. For example, the USA reported data suggest a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases (see section [3E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 2 weeks the positivity rate has been stable at 9%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html). The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily case counts, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). India also drives the next most affected region -- South East Asia -- with persistent high daily case reports. - Mods.UBA/MPP]
