An outbreak of oyster herpesvirus has been confirmed at the shellfish farm in the River Blackwater Estuary, Essex.

On 1 Aug 2012, Fish Health Inspectors from the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) examined stock from a shellfish farm in the River Blackwater Estuary, Essex following reports of high levels of mortality in Pacific (rock) oysters, _Crassostrea gigas_.

Samples taken from the affected site were confirmed as positive for oyster herpesvirus (OsHV-1 uvar), and a containment area has been declared in the River Blackwater Estuary, Essex and the River Colne Estuary, Essex.

In accordance with provisions under the Aquatic Animal Health (England and Wales) Regulations 2009, movements of shellfish out of the containment area in the River Blackwater Estuary and the River Colne Estuary have been restricted, following the confirmation of oyster herpesvirus (OsHV-1 uvar).

Cefas, acting on behalf of Defra, has issued a confirmed designation prohibiting the movement of Pacific oysters from the containment area and applying additional control measures [details at the source URL].

OsHV-1 uvar affects Pacific oysters and can result in high rates of shellfish mortalities. OsHV-1 uvar is an emerging disease that has been associated with high levels of mortality in Pacific oysters in France, Jersey and some bays in the Republic of Ireland. There are no implications for human health.

Any suspicion of the presence of OsHV-1 in Pacific oysters should be immediately reported to Cefas in Weymouth.
