The following data on the global distribution of trichinosis and its status
in the United States were abstracted from the GIDEON software program:
Trichinosis - species distribution:
- It is estimated that 11 million are infested worldwide. Most infections
are due to _Trichinella spiralis_ (T1). Trichinosis accounted for 1.5% of
all food-related outbreaks in Europe during 1991 to 1992.
- _T. nativa_ (T2) is found in arctic regions, and transmitted by horse
and bear.
- _T. britovi_ (T3) occurs in temperate zones, and is acquired from horses
and boar.

- _T. pseudospiralis_ occurs in the Nearctic and Oceania, and is found in
birds and omnivores. Rare human cases have been reported.

- _T. nelsoni_ (T7) is found in the tropics, and is acquired from wart hogs.
Trichinosis in the United States:
- 2,773 cases were reported during 1944 to 1953; 2,252 during 1954 to 1963;
1,273 during 1964 to 1973; 1,351 during 1974 to 1983. An average of 57
cases were reported annually during 1982 to 1986 (5 fatal cases during this
period).

- In 1990, Iowa accounted for over 60% of reported cases; 38 of 62 cases
reported in 1991 were reported from Wisconsin; 41 cases were reported in
1992 (28 of these from Alaska); 16 in 1993; 32 in 1994; 29 in 1995 (59%
from Idaho and Iowa); 11 in 1996; 3 first half of 1997.
- 128 food-related outbreaks were registered during 1973 to 1987.
- 23 fatal cases were reported during 1961 to 1970; 1 (in 1989) during 1986
to 1995.
- Pork accounts for 61% of cases and bear meat 33%. Cougar jerky was
implicated in 10 cases in Idaho in 1995.
- 21% of Alaskan lynx (_Felis lynx_) are infested with _Trichinella nativa_.
