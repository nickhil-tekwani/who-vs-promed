Human death in Indonesia now linked to sick chickens
------------------------------------------------------
An Indonesian child who died of bird flu last weekend [8 Jul 2007]
[see: Avian influenza, human (109): Indonesia, WHO 20070711.2217]
appears to have caught the virus from dead or sick chickens in the
area carrying the disease, a Health Ministry official said on
Saturday [14 Jul 2007].
Contact with infected fowl is the most common way for humans to
contract the H5N1 virus, but medical experts had initially struggled
to pinpoint the source of the infection in this case. It is always a
concern when the cause of a human infection cannot be traced as it
makes infection control more difficult.
"She [previously reported as "he" by the Indonesian Health Ministry
and the World Health Organisation (WHO)] had indirect contact with
dead chickens near her school," Joko Suyono, an official at the
Ministry's bird flu centre, said by telephone. The victim, from the
city of Cilegon in Banten province, had initially been identified as
a 6-year-old boy, but Suyono said this was due to a mix up between
the hospital where she was treated and a laboratory.
The official said that tests on dead chickens found near the girl's
school showed they were infected with bird flu. "We cannot know
whether she touched sick chickens or not because she died. But we
know surrounding her school the virus is endemic (in fowl)," he added.
Suyono said tests for the virus on people who may have had contact
with the girl had proved negative and also said the findings in this
case ruled out the possibility of the virus being transmitted between
humans. "So far, there have been no human-to-human cases in
Indonesia," he said.
Bird flu is endemic in bird [poultry] populations in most parts of
Indonesia, where millions of backyard chickens live in close
proximity with humans. Indonesia has had 81 confirmed human deaths
from bird flu, the most of any country in the world. According to WHO
data, globally there have been 192 human deaths out of 318 cases of
the disease.

[An earlier Reuters report
(<http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=JAK4320>
forwarded by Mary Marshall stated the following.
A spokeswoman at the Jakarta hospital where the boy [i.e., now girl]
was treated said that along with some chickens dying near the boy's
school there were also water fowl in the school area. "There are a
lot of water fowl roaming near the boy's school although they
probably didn't get into the school," said Tuty Hendrarwardati, a
spokeswoman for the Sulianti Saroso hospital. The boy, who had been
suffering from fever before visiting relatives in the city of Bandung
on 25 Jun 2007, had also been to the zoo, she said. Researchers in
Thailand detected H5N1 antibodies in 50 tigers at a zoo in 2004 --
proving that they were infected -- although they found no evidence of
the virus in any of its zookeepers. "He stayed in his relatives'
house near Bandung zoo and visited it (the zoo) as well," she added.
The boy was later admitted to hospital in Tangerang, west of the
capital, before being sent to Sulianti Saroso hospital on 5 Jul 2007,
she added.
On the available evidence it is unsafe at present to draw any
conclusion about the source of infection in this case, particularly
in view of the confusion in the reporting of the sex of the victim.
It can be concluded, however, with reasonable certainty that the
virus was not contracted by person-to-person transmission. - Mod.CP]
