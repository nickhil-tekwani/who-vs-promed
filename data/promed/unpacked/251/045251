Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) (genus _Tospovirus_, family
_Bunyaviridae_) has become endemic in several parts of the world.
Between 2000 and 2004, the virus was reported from several states in
the United States, and the most recent report was from Georgia (2).
In South America, IYSV was 1st reported from Brazil (3).
Symptoms indicative of IYSV infection (1), such as diamond-shaped and
irregular chlorotic and necrotic lesions, were observed during 2004
and 2005 in onion fields in Colina and Tiltil (Chacabuco Province)
and Rengo (Cachapoal Province) located in central Chile. In the
sampled fields, as much as 50 percent of the crop showed symptoms. In
all 3 locations, the crop was destined for bulb production, and the
cultivar was a long-day Valenciana-type.
Approximately 50 and 5 ha in Chacabuco and Cachapoal provinces,
respectively, were surveyed. Symptomatic plants were collected and
tested in the laboratory for confirmation of IYSV infection. A
commercially available IYSV-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay kit was used (Adgen Limited, Ayr, Scotland, UK) that confirmed
the samples were infected with IYSV.
Total nucleic acids were extracted, and, using primers flanking the
nucleoprotein (NP) gene of IYSV, reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction was used to verify virus identity. Primer sequences
were 5'-TAA AAC AAA CAT TCA AAC AA-3' and 5'-CTC TTA AAC ACA TTT AAC
AAG CAC-3'.
The resulting 1.2-kb DNA amplicons from 5 samples were cloned and
sequenced (GenBank Accession No. DQ150107). Nucleotide sequence
comparisons with known IYSV NP gene sequences showed 95 to 98 percent
identity, confirming the virus as IYSV.
The presence of IYSV in Brazil, and now in Chile, indicates its
potential to become established in onion crops in the region.

[IYSV is transmitted by the Onion thrips (_Thrips tabaci_), but does
not appear to be transmitted by the Western flower thrips
(_Frankliniella occidentalis_). It mainly infects onion, garlic,
leek, lisianthus and iris (it was 1st isolated from iris, hence the
name Iris yellow spot virus). There is no evidence of it being
seedborne. The industry is concerned about the potential impact of
IYSV in Washington state, particularly because it has been recorded
as present in Colorado, Arizona, Utah and California.
IYSV-infected onions cannot be cured. Infected plants should be
removed and destroyed, along with cull piles and volunteers.
Maintaining good cultural management practices will help to reduce
stress on the plants, thus lessening the disease's effect. Other
management practices include maintaining good soil fertility and
adequate irrigation supplemented with good management of thrips and
weeds. Onion thrips are best managed with chemical insecticides.
Although no cultivars are known to be resistant to IYSV, research has
shown that cultivars vary in their susceptibility to both the virus
and the thrips vector.
