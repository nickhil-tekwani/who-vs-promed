The health office of this town is awaiting the blood test results of the 55 residents who had symptoms of chikungunya [virus infection], an insectborne virus that is transmitted to humans by virus-carrying _Aedes_ mosquitoes.

Municipal health officer Dr Emmanuel Obania said they conducted blood tests for the 55 people residing in the villages of Marikaban, San Juan, Pobalcion 13, 14, and 15, and brought the samples to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) to determine whether they had chikungunya [virus infection], which can possibly lead to death [see Mod. comment below].

Obania said they declared an outbreak after a number of people showing symptoms of chikungunya [virus infection] were brought to different hospitals since January [2013].

[The statement that chikungunya virus infection can possibly lead to death is misleading. Mortality is very rare, whereas morbidity in an outbreak can be extremely high.

The above report does not mention clinical signs or the basis on which the diagnosis was made, in contrast to, say, dengue virus infection. Acute arthralgia with rash is typical of chikungunya virus infections, and the joint pain may persist for weeks or months after the acute phase has ended.

The Philippines have had sporadic chikungunya outbreaks over the past 12 months.
