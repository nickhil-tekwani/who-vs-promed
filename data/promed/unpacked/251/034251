Analysis lags on Hungarian sludge leak
--------------------------------------
Report stirs controversy as it reveals unexpected levels of toxic heavy metals.

A week after around one million cubic metres of red sludge escaped from a
Hungarian alumina factory, an analysis commissioned by the environmental
group Greenpeace has revealed that more than 50 tonnes of arsenic may have
been released as a result of the spill. The sludge, a by-product of alumina
(aluminium oxide) production, has killed at least 7 people and contaminated
several thousand hectares of land north of Hungary's Lake Balaton on 4 Oct
2010, which escaped contamination. The village of Kolontar and 2 smaller
villages may have to be abandoned completely, and scientists predict that
the environment will take years to recover.

The Greenpeace analysis, by Austria's Federal Environment Agency in Vienna,
examined the heavy metal content of mud samples collected by campaigners
last Tuesday [5 Oct 2010].

In addition to containing almost twice as much arsenic (110 milligrams per
kilogram dry mass) as expected for the red mud resulting from aluminium
oxide production, the concentrations of mercury and chromium are also
relatively high, says chemist Herwig Schuster, chief Greenpeace campaigner
for Central and Eastern Europe. "Because arsenic is readily soluble we
might be in for a major groundwater problem," he adds.

Work in progress
----------------
The study has met with scepticism from Hungarian chemists, partly because
bauxite, the ore from which most aluminium oxide (and ultimately aluminium)
is derived, contains neither mercury nor much arsenic. However, Greenpeace
says that the findings have been confirmed by an independent laboratory in
Hungary. The Hungarian government's own figures -- based on samples taken
by scientists last week [week of 4 Oct 2010] at 2 sites in the area -- are
yet to be published.

"It's hard to say what needs to be done as long as we don't know exactly
which and how much toxic substances have been released," says Gergely
Simon, an environmental chemist for the Hungarian arm of the Clean Air
Action Group. He has asked the Hungarian home office to reveal all of the
information collected so far on the mud's chemical composition.

Janos Szepvolgyi, director of the Hungarian Academy of Science's Institute
of Materials and Environmental Chemistry in Budapest, is heading up the
government effort to analyse soil and water in the area. "All life is
dead," he says. "A 2 to 5 centimetre [0.8-2 in] thick layer of caustic mud
is covering the soil. The mud needs to be physically collected and removed
-- this will take a long time."

On the basis of a preliminary analysis, Janos Szepvolgyi says, "We know
that the mud contains some 2 per cent titanium and 0.5 per cent vanadium
oxide. But the real problem is dissolved heavy metals, which might enter
surface waters and will be taken up by plants."

But preliminary analysis of their samples, he adds, suggests that the
content of dissolved arsenic and chromium is manageable. The most
contaminated surface water flows are a small creek called Torma and the
Marcal river. The Raba river, a tributary of the Danube, is less affected,
and contamination in the Danube is almost negligible, says Szepvolgyi.

But he stresses that the findings are preliminary, and that the water
quality of all creeks and rivers in the area must be checked regularly.

The analysis, which includes the results of a laboratory analysis of
samples taken on Friday [8 Oct 2010] by scientists at the Academy's
Research Institute for Soils Science and Agricultural Chemistry in
Budapest, will be released later this week, says Szepvolgyi.

Water hazard
------------
Schuster says that Greenpeace's figures suggest that the drinking water
supplies of at least 100 000 people could be affected by potentially toxic
levels, including inhabitants of the city of Gyor downstream of the
contaminated rivers. Exactly how fast and far the contamination will spread
depends on the permeability of local soils -- which scientists have not yet
assessed.

The Greenpeace findings are surprising, says Tamas Weiszburg, a
mineralogist at the Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest, who was not
involved in either analysis.

Although small amounts of arsenic in bauxite sludge might have accumulated
over time, "If that [Greenpeace] sample is representative there is no
question that industrial wastes have been mixed in the basin," says Weiszburg.

Greenpeace also suspects that the leaked basin may have contained toxic
waste besides the sludge from aluminium oxide production.

"Environmental standards for old plants in Hungary are lagging far behind
the European rules for newly built production facilities," says Schuster.
"We don't even know in which year the dam was built and how often it was
modified."

Meanwhile, the Hungarian government has warned that there is a real danger
of a 2nd toxic spill from the same site. Another dam on the site looks
weak, and if it breaks several hundred thousand tonnes of sludge could
flood the surrounding land and rivers.

The government said last week [week of 4 Oct 20100] that it will have
experts from the Geological Institute of Hungary in Budapest re-assess the
safety of 3 more storage sites that together hold about 50 million tonnes
of red mud. Some 30 million tonnes are held at Ajka, 12 million tonnes at
Almasfuzito, and 8 million tones at Mosonmagyarovar. The Almasfuzito and
the Mosonmagyarovar are situated in the immediate vicinity of the river Danube.

[The spill is a terrible tragedy and clearly there are some toxic issues
that surround this sludge. How much of what substance seems to be a huge
question. There has been the assumption through all of these reports that
the sludge is homogenous and I have been wondering as I read these various
reports, articles, and emails if that is necessarily the case. It seems
various groups and scientists are reporting a variety of heavy metals with
a wide range of concentrations. One report has suggested radioactivity.

While it is a tragedy and it has caused damage to homes and villages, the
situation still needs reputable scientists to perform analysis on exactly
what is in the sludge, how much of those substances are in the sludge, and
what valence state or chemical is precisely involved. - Mod.TG
