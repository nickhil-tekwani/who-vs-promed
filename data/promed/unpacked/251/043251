The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) has received 215 reports of tickborne encephalitis in Switzerland since the beginning of the year [2020]. This is more than twice as many as last year [2019], when 97 cases were reported. Ticks are known to be most prevalent during the summer months. It is likely that favourable weather conditions, coupled with social distancing rules, have prompted many to venture into forests, the FOPH says by way of explanation. It is also possible that semi-confinement measures have prevented some people from being vaccinated.

The estimated number of consultations in June [2020] for a tick bite has surpassed the number logged in 2018, a record year. All cantons except Geneva and Ticino have been affected.

The FOPH points out that the vaccine is a good counter-measure to tickborne meningoencephalitis (TBE). It is recommended for adults and children, generally from the age of 6 who are staying in a high-risk area. A free smartphone tick app developed by the Zurich University of Applied Sciences provides users with useful maps and tips on how to minimise the risk of being bitten by ticks.

[This is shaping up to be an active year for tickborne encephalitis (TBE) cases in Switzerland. The Swiss government has a proactive TBE vaccination program, and the office repeated the call above for anybody who may be exposed to ticks -- for example walkers, especially in forests -- to be vaccinated. The optimum time for vaccination is in winter so that walkers and hikers are protected once the good weather and riskiest period (from April to October) rolls around.

As cited earlier, according to government information, the most widespread TBE vector tick species in Switzerland is the wood tick (_Ixodes ricinus_, commonly known as the castor bean tick or sheep tick). It prefers deciduous woods with abundant undergrowth, the edge of the forest, and forest paths and waits on low-growing plants until a warm-blooded host (a person or animal) brushes against the plant.

In a previous comment in 2017 concerning TBE in Switzerland, Dr Ivo M Foppa indicated that the incidence of TBE in Switzerland has increased markedly, roughly about 50%, since 2000. The reason for the increase in TBE incidence in Central/Western/Northern Europe is unknown.

TBE is a viral infection caused by one of 3 TBE virus subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ixodes ticks. - Mod.TY
