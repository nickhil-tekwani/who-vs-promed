Encephalitis has claimed the lives of 8 children in Bihar in the past month, with 2 of them succumbing to the disease on Thursday [30 May 2013], an official said. Encephalitis causes high fever, irritation, and swelling of the brain. An official said: "2 more children have died in Champaran district."

The 1st encephalitis-related death in the state this year [2013] was reported in the last week of April [2013] in Muzaffarpur, about 70 km [43 mi] from [Patna]. Last year [2012], the disease killed nearly 240 children in Muzaffarpur and Gaya districts.

[The report above provides no indication of the etiological agent responsible for these encephalitis cases. Encephalitis cases have begun to increase in north eastern India. Encephalitis cases normally increase during the monsoon season. So far this year (2013), acute encephalitis (AES) has claimed lives and affected over 100 people even before the onset of the usual disease season.

Interestingly, cases of encephalitis have occurred this year (2013) in several locations in eastern India. At the beginning of April a ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20130402.1615081) stated: "Encephalitis cases have already been reported from Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal in India this year [2013], totalling 228 cases and 49 fatalities up to 19 Mar 2013. Of those cases, 7, all from West Bengal, were classified as Japanese encephalitis [virus infections]. There have also been cases in neighboring Bangladesh this year (2013)."
