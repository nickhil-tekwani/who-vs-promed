[As can be seen from the mortality statistics showing a 100 percent case fatality rate (of those that become cases, 100 percent died) and an almost 90 percent mortality rate on the farm (out of 9194 susceptible animals on the 2 farms, 8218 swine got sick and died), African swine fever can have devastating impact, especially when a new strain is introduced to susceptible animals. It is truly a major cause of loss in Africa and control and prevention has an impact on the economic health of a region and therefore on the well being of the citizens in the area. Let's hope this outbreak can be controlled by the field epidemiology unit sent to investigate before there is further spread. - Mod.PC
