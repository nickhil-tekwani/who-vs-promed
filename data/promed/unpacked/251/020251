The Management of Rospotrebnadzor in Bashkortostan reports that
anthrax cases have been confirmed and that as of 1 Sep 2008, the
number of registered cases of anthrax are 11 persons. All of them are
now in hospital.

Since August 2008, 30 specialists have been investigating samples of
soil and water collected in Yanaul and the Yanaulsky district. Work
will be continued up to 10 Sep 2008. Analyses are being carried out
in the trial laboratory in the Centre of Hygiene & Epidemiology of
Bashkortostan. Samples are being analyzed.

172.5 kg of meat have been taken away from the population and
destroyed. Anti-epidemic, preventive and treatment measures are underway.

There is an outbreak of anthrax in the Privolzhsky Federal District
of Russia. The number of people exposed to contaminated meat has
reached up to 241 persons. Clinical anthrax has been confirmed in 11
humans. The outbreak was reported in the villages of Ural, Andreevka
and Yamandy of the Yanaulsky district [of Bashkortostan - Mod.NP].

A 46-year-old woman, the owner of a sick horse, slaughtered the
animal and distributed (sold and shared) meat among relatives,
neighbours and inhabitants of the above mentioned villages. She
remains healthy, but her son, who took part in the slaughter, fell ill.

Part of this meat was taken to Kazan [the capital of Tatarstan -
Mod.NP] by a student of the local university. _Bacillus anthracis_
was revealed in this meat, which had been kept in a refrigerator in
the university hostel.

All exposed persons are under medical supervision. Quarantine has
been established in these villages, and preventive measures are being
carried out. Physicians fear that the meat could have been
distributed in other regions also. These 3 villages are located close
to the town of Yanaul, through which the railway Kazan-Moscow passes.

Specialists say that horses could have contracted the infection
through grazing near or on the animal anthrax burial sites located
near the village of Ural.

[To quote my Russian colleague from post 20051018.3040: "The total
area of the Republic of Bashkortostan is 143 000 sq. km (0.8 percent
of the common area of Russia). The capital of Bashkortostan is the
city of Ufa. Bashkortostan occupies the largest part of Southern
Ural, and adjoining it are plains. In the north, Bashkortostan
borders the Perm and Sverdlovsk regions; in the east, the Chelyabinsk
region; in the southeast, the south and southwest, the Orenburg
region; in the west, the Republic of Tatarstan; and in the northwest,
the Udmurt Republic" (i.e. it is in Central Russia).

Unfortunately, there are multiple places in this republic named Ural,
Andreevka and Yamandy, as well as Yanaul. - Mod.MHJ]
