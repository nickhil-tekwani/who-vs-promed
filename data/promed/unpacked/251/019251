Hong Kong health officials (Centre for Health Protection-CHP) report investigating a local case of measles infection.

The case involves a 6-year-old girl who developed fever and sore throat on 2 and 3 Aug 2022, and developed rash and conjunctivitis on 5 and 6 Aug 2022. She was taken to a private pediatrician on 3 Aug 2022 and to Hong Kong Baptist Hospital (HKBH) on 5 and 6 Aug 2022 for medical attention. She was admitted to HKBH for treatment on 7 Aug 2022. She is in stable condition and was discharged on 8 Aug 2022.

Her blood sample tested positive for immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to the measles virus upon laboratory testing. The patient has received measles vaccinations. She had no travel history during the incubation period and the communicable period.

According to information provided by family members of the patient, she did not have contact with measles patients during the incubation period. Her home contacts have remained asymptomatic so far and have been put under medical surveillance.

Upon notification of the case, the CHP immediately commenced epidemiological investigations and conducted relevant contact tracing. Investigations are ongoing.

A spokesman for the Department of Health said, "Measles is a highly infectious disease caused by the measles virus. It can be transmitted by airborne droplets or direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of infected persons, and, less commonly, by articles soiled with nose and throat secretions. A patient can pass the disease to other persons from 4 days before to 4 days after the appearance of a skin rash."

The spokesman advised, "The incubation period (the period from infection to appearance of illness) of measles ranges from 7 to 21 days. Symptoms of measles include fever, skin rash, cough, runny nose, and red eyes. If symptoms arise, members of the public should wear surgical masks, stop going to work or school and avoid going to crowded places. They should also avoid contact with non-immune persons, especially persons with weakened immunity, pregnant women, and children younger than 1. Those suspected to have been infected are advised to seek medical attention as early as possible and reveal relevant contact history of measles to healthcare professionals."

The spokesman reminded, "Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles. Those who have not received 2 doses of measles-containing vaccines, with unknown vaccination history or with unknown immunity against measles are urged to consult their doctor for advice on vaccination."

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the measles outbreak that started on 13 Dec 2021 in Liberia, continues with an increasing trend.

A total of 5923 suspected cases have been reported, including 5528 confirmed cases (93.3%) as of 20 Jul 2022.

A total of 71 deaths were recorded, yielding a case fatality rate of 1.2% among all suspected cases.

As of 20 Jul 2022, the outbreak remains active in all the 15 counties in Liberia.

Of the 5528 confirmed cases, a total of 2474 (44.8%) were known to be vaccinated against measles. However, 2439 (44.1%) had not been vaccinated, 531 (9.6%) had unknown vaccination status, and 85 (1.5%) cases were under 9 months of age and therefore vaccination was not yet required.

The 2nd phase of the nationwide measles vaccination campaigns in all 15 counties is being conducted.

The measles outbreak in Liberia has been escalating since March 2022. Since then, weekly reported cases have been far higher than in the previous 4 years, making the ongoing outbreak to be the most severe measles outbreak of the past 5 years

A measles outbreak has killed 80 children in Zimbabwe since April [2022], the ministry of health has said, blaming church sect gatherings for the surge.

In a statement seen by Reuters on Sunday [14 Aug 2022], the ministry said the outbreak had now spread nationwide, with a case fatality rate of 6.9%.

Health Secretary Jasper Chimedza said that as of Thursday [11 Aug 2022], 1036 suspected cases and 125 confirmed cases had been reported since the outbreak, with Manicaland in eastern Zimbabwe accounting for most infections.

"The ministry of health and child care wishes to inform the public that the ongoing outbreak of measles which was first reported on [10 Apr 2022] has since spread nationwide following church gatherings," Chimedza said in a statement.

"These gatherings which were attended by people from different provinces of the country with unknown vaccination status led to the spread of measles to previously unaffected areas."

Manicaland, the 2nd-most populous province, had 356 cases and 45 deaths, Chimedza said.

Most reported cases are among children aged between 6 months and 15 from religious sects who are not vaccinated against measles due to religious beliefs, he added.

Bishop Andby Makuru, leader of Johanne Masowe apostolic sect, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In Zimbabwe, some apostolic church sects forbid their followers from taking vaccinations or any medical treatment. The churches attract millions of followers with their promises to heal illnesses and deliver people from poverty.

With a low vaccination rate and in some cases, no record keeping, the government has resolved to start a mass vaccination campaign in areas where the outbreak was recorded.

The measles outbreak is expected to strain an ailing health sector already blighted by lack of medication and intermittent strikes by health workers.

The most effective measles prevention is vaccination. The healthcare personnel and the government must convince the people who are resistant to vaccination of its importance. The best approach may be to talk to the church elders. - Mod.LK]

[4] Afghanistan: measles plus other infectious diseases

A recent World Health Organization (WHO) report states that Afghanistan is facing multiple disease outbreaks, including acute watery diarrhea (AWD), measles, Congo fever [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever], dengue fever, and COVID-19.

The WHO report states that there has been a substantial rise in acute watery diarrhea (AWD) cases nationwide.

More than 19 050 cases of AWD are confirmed in various provinces across Afghanistan, especially Kabul, Paktia, Khost, Paktika, Jawzjan Ghazni, Kandahar, and Zabul provinces.

Despite a decline in occurrences, all provinces are still reporting instances of measles, according to the report noting total cases of 64 654 throughout Afghanistan.

Congo fever, or scientifically Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), is also spread in different zones of Afghanistan particularly in 13 provinces in southern, south-eastern, eastern, and central regions, with 229 confirmed cases, with 6 associated deaths.

According to the report, the province of Nangarhar experienced a spike in new dengue fever cases in July 2022.

To respond to epidemics, medical emergencies, and natural disasters threatening Afghanistan in July 2022, WHO continues to mobilize resources and build up its capacities.

A 5.1 aftershock struck the south-eastern provinces of Khost and Paktika on 18 Jul 2022, in addition to the 5.9 magnitude earthquake that struck on 22 Jun 2022, injuring more than 361 000 people and claiming 1036 lives.

Furthermore, there were more casualties due to flash flooding in July [2022]. Additionally, hundreds of homes were destroyed, as well as roads and bridges in areas affected by the earthquake on 22 Jun 2022.

According to headlines in the New York Times in February 2022, "Afghanistan's healthcare system is collapsing under stress. Hospitals and clinics are struggling to hold up amid a cash shortage and a vast surge of malnutrition and disease. By one estimate, 90 percent may close in the next few months. The World Health Organization has said that outbreaks of diarrhea, measles, dengue fever, malaria and COVID-19 threaten to overwhelm overburdened hospitals."

The situation is dire. Adding to the suffering is the lack of food, clean water, and electricity. - Mod.LK]
