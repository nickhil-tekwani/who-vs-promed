Bovine viral diarrhea - Australia
---------------------------------
We read with interest the recent ProMED-mail posting (20090106.0051)
on bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD), referring to the current situation
in Australia.

Concerning the situation in Australia, the virus (BVDV) is endemic,
with records of its presence going back many decades. There is no
increased incidence of neonatal loss attributed to this or any other
cause in the country. However, the launch of an inactivated vaccine
against BVDV in Australia in the last few years has resulted in a
campaign which aims to increase awareness among farmers and
veterinarians of the importance of disease induced by BVDV -- this
might have prompted the recent ProMED posting.

We would also like to clarify that the spectrum of acute disease
attributable to the causative virus, can range from inapparent to
severe, but, contrary to the impression sometimes given in some
publications, is not associated solely with viruses of genotype 2.
Nevertheless, type 2 viruses have caused significant outbreaks in a
number of countries over the last decade and have prompted attention
from a disease control perspective because immunity to type 1 viruses
may not always protect against viruses of the type 2 genotype.
Analysis of a large number of representative isolates of BVDV from
Australia over the last 30 years has shown the vast majority to be of
genotype 1c. Unlike most countries, in Australia, viruses of genotype
2 have not been detected.

[ProMED-mail posting 20090106.0051 included the following
media-derived information: "Bovine viral diarrhea has been going
through herds of cattle in Australia over the last year (2008) with
the most serious results. There have been calving rate losses of up
to 40 percent in recorded herds of cattle."

Subsequently, ProMED-mail's following request for information
followed: "The BVD situation in Australia is, most likely, similar to
the situation in other cattle breeding countries. In view of the
above newswire, it will be interesting to obtain more information on
the cases observed there during 2008".

We are most grateful for the authoritative response, provided by Drs
Drew and Kirkland who are the heads of 2 OIE reference laboratories
for BVD: respectively, the Virology Department, VLA Weybridge, UK and
the Virology Laboratory, Elizabeth Macarthur Agriculture Institute
(EMAI), Camden, NSW, Australia. (The 3rd OIE ref lab for BVD is in Canada).

It is indeed relieving to note from them that, in fact, "there is no
increased incidence of neonatal loss attributed to this or any other
cause in the country."
