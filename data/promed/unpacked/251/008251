[We can assume that most of the cases & deaths were in children, and
according to the figures given, JE vaccination is unfortunately only
reaching very few of them. Given that every year Nepal has epidemics due
to multiple infections, we would be interested to know how many cases were
laboratory confirmed. - Mod.JW
