Hepatitis E is spreading rapidly in the Almas area of Ashiri Darra in Upper Dir, and over 60 patients have been diagnosed with the disease during the last one month. Those diagnosed with hepatitis E also include women and children. The local people have expressed grave concern over the outbreak of the epidemic and called upon the government to send health teams to the area to stop the disease from further spreading.

The area people said hepatitis E has affected almost every home in the area, and most of the patients are women. They said the area residents have stopped the use of water available from pipelines, and they are now using water from streams, but still the disease is spreading rapidly.

A local person said while talking to TNN that 5 members of his family have been infected. He said he has no idea how and from what source the disease is spreading so quickly. He said most people in Almas are poor and cannot afford expensive treatment. He said an infected patient needs to be shifted to Timergara, where the treatment cost ranges from INR 10 000 [USD 139] to INR 15 000 [USD 209]. He called upon the government to take immediate steps to stop the spread of disease in the area.

Regional Health Centre (RHC) Incharge Dr Riazullah said hepatitis spreads from polluted water and stool of infected patients. He said the water of the whole area is polluted due to lack of a proper sewerage system, and as a result, the disease is spreading quickly. He advised the area people to use boiled water for consumption.

Hepatitis E is a virus infection that infects a patient's liver, causing it to swell up. According to WebMD, a leading health information website, hepatitis E doesn't usually lead to long-term illness or liver damage like some other forms of hepatitis. However, it can be dangerous for pregnant women or anyone with weak immune systems, including the elderly or people who are ill.

Hepatitis E is more common in areas with poor handwashing habits and lack of clean water. Main symptoms include fever, low appetite, belly pain, skin rash, joint pain, and yellowish skin or eyes. An infected patient must consume more water, eat healthy foods, and rest.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, whereas genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Acute epidemic hepatitis E is attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. - Mod.LL
