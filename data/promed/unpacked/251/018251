[JH] is urging dog owners to be mindful of the dangers of algae in Canterbury rivers after losing her beloved chocolate Labrador (Tucker). Tucker died within 2 hours of swimming at the Waimakariri River this month [January 2022].

[JH], who lives in West Melton, said the gregarious, energetic 11-month-old was swimming and fetching sticks, while his more placid sister Tess mostly looked on from the riverbank.

[JH]'s partner [PF] had taken the pair to the river, about 2 km [1.2 mi] upstream of the popular Willows spot, which has a dog park. But within half an hour after arriving home, Tucker had diarrhoea and was suffering seizures.

As [JH] and [PF] drove him to a vet in Christchurch, Tucker became unresponsive. He was pronounced dead on arrival.

A necropsy was not conducted, and the cause of death is not confirmed; however, the vet suspected poisoning from cyanobacteria.

[JH] said while [PF] had noticed areas of brown algae -- which they commonly saw on rivers whenever they took their dogs swimming -- he had not seen any cyanobacteria, also called blue-green algae or toxic algae, at the site. This type of algae is a well-known toxin to dogs. It appears in rivers as thick dark brown or black mats having a slimy or velvety texture and musty smell.

[JH] suspected the cyanobacteria may have been in unseen quantities in the water and accidentally swallowed by Tucker. [JH] believed the low river levels at the time probably enhanced concentrations.

[JH] wanted to share her story to warn other dog owners. [JH] and [PF] would not be taking Tess to the rivers again in summer.

"I would hate for somebody else to go through it; it's absolutely horrific," [JH] said. "Tucker was like the life of the family. He was a talker, very playful, lots of people in the community knew him."

The Waimakariri River was not subject to a health warning or advisory note for cyanobacteria at the time.

Environment Canterbury science team leader surface-water scientist Shirley Hayward said river health warnings were issued based on human health, not dog health.

"We've monitored multiple sites across the Waimakariri River. All sites show low levels of cyanobacteria, well below guideline values for human health associated with swimming," Hayward said. "It is important for dog owners to know how to identify potentially toxic cyanobacteria in rivers, to prevent their dogs from getting sick."

Community and Public Health has issued a health warning for the Selwyn River, from Whitecliffs Domain down past Glentunnel camping ground, due to moderate to high cyanobacteria cover in the area. There are also warning at the Rakahuri/Ashley River at the Rangiora-Loburn Bridge and Whakatipu/Twizel River at picnic area upstream of State Highway 8.

After Sunday's [30 Jan 2022] fire at the Sutton Tools manufacturing plant in Kaiapoi, a warning about toxic oil has been issued for the Cam/Ruataniwha River. Oil has been detected in the Kaiapoi and Waimakariri rivers downstream of where it meets the sea.

Freshwater scientist Susie Wood told Radio New Zealand she estimated there had been more than 200 dog deaths across the country in the last 10 years from dogs eating or licking algal mats in rivers. She said climate change and nutrients and sediments entering rivers were contributing factors to growing algae levels.

Canterbury Medical Officer of Health Dr Cheryl Brunton said there were 2 cases of cyanotoxin poisoning in humans reported to the Canterbury District Health Board in the last 5 years.

Late last year [2021], a child developed a skin rash after playing in water at Chamberlains Ford on the Selwyn River. The 1st case was in 2020 and involved an individual who presented with tingling hands and feet and stomach cramps after exposure.

[The cyanobacteria group of algae is often very toxic, and there are a number of algaes producing toxins. They can range in color from brown to red, green, blue, or a blue-green color. However, they can all be toxic, and it only takes a tiny amount to produce clinical signs and even death.

_Phormidium_ is a type of cyanobacteria (algae) that is widespread throughout lakes and rivers around New Zealand, including those with very good water quality. It looks like a dark brown leathery mat and is typically found on rocks in stony riverbeds. Blooms increase normally during summer when the river and stream flows are low.

With increased growth, the algae can start to produce cyanotoxins, which can be toxic to dogs, livestock, and people.

The algae mats can come loose and settle on riverbanks and shallow areas where animals are more likely to consume it. Dogs are attracted to its musty smell; it can be fatal to them if eaten. If animals display signs like lethargy, muscle tremors, fast breathing, twitching, paralysis, or convulsions, contact a vet immediately.

You can also be at risk from illness if you come into contact or drink the water from rivers with high concentrations of the algae in it.

Reactions to the cyanobacteria can include stomach and intestinal illness, trouble breathing, skin irritation, and neurotoxic reactions like numbness and tingling.

Always check areas in waterways where people and animals frequently go, and if you think you're having a reaction, contact a doctor.

Some location data of toxic algaes may be found on this site: https://www.gw.govt.nz/your-region/news/archive/2022/01. Additional information of toxic algae locations may be found on this site: https://www.orc.govt.nz/managing-our-environment/water/toxic-algae-sightings.

If there's a large amount of algae, don't drink or make contact with the water, and keep animals away. Do not let your pet drink it or swim in it or even walk in it. They can lick it off of their feet or legs and develop problems.
