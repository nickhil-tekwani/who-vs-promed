California animal health officials have confirmed another equine case of West Nile virus (WNV). So far this year [2018], there have been 11 confirmed cases of WNV in California horses.

"On 2 Nov 2018, a 1 year old grade mare in Sacramento County with unknown vaccination history and displaying neurologic signs was confirmed positive for West Nile virus," the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) said in a statement on its website. "The mare was euthanized due to severity of clinical signs."

According to the CDFA,
- the positive horses were located in Amador, Kern, Merced (2), Placer, Sacramento (3), San Joaquin, Shasta, and Stanislaus counties;
- 5 horses were unvaccinated, 3 had an unknown vaccine history, and 3 were vaccinated; and
- 6 horses died or were euthanized, and 5 horses are alive.

"(The) CDFA urges horse owners to consult their veterinarian concerning a WNV vaccination program to ensure maximum protection of their horses," the agency said. In 2017 there were 21 confirmed cases of WNV in California horses, according to USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service data.

About WNV
West Nile virus is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Not all infected horses show clinical signs, but those that do can exhibit the following:
- flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed;
- fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation (twitching);
- hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- occasional drowsiness;
- propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control);
- spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
- asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia (incoordination).

West Nile virus infection has no cure; however, some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40%.

Studies have shown that vaccines can be effective WNV-prevention tools. Horses vaccinated in past years need an annual booster shot, but veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually -- one in the spring and another in the fall -- in areas with prolonged mosquito seasons. In contrast, previously unvaccinated horses require a 2-shot vaccination series in a 3-6 week period. Full immunity takes several weeks to achieve.

In addition to vaccinations, owners should work to reduce mosquito population and breeding areas and limit horses' mosquito exposure by
- removing stagnant water sources;
- dumping, cleaning, and refilling water buckets and troughs regularly;
- keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times (typically early in the morning and evening); and
- applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

The state veterinarian has announced 5 new cases of horses sickened by West Nile virus (WNV) in east Tennessee. Two horses in Washington County recently tested positive for WNV. Bradley, Cumberland, and Sullivan counties are reporting one case in each county. Horses with WNV cannot directly infect people.

Mosquitoes and other biting insects are responsible for transmission of WNV. Clinical signs in horses may include fever, weakness, loss of appetite, or convulsions. The illness can cause lasting effects and, in some cases, can be fatal.

"Even though it is starting to feel like fall, mosquitoborne illnesses remain a health threat for horses in Tennessee," state veterinarian Dr Charles Hatcher said. "Horse owners should take preventative measures to protect their livestock year-round. The vaccine for WNV is extremely effective. Your veterinarian can help you decide the best vaccination plan for your horse."

Other tips include the following:
- never share needles, dental, or surgical equipment among different animals;
- eliminate standing-water sources where insects may gather and breed;
- manage manure and disposal; and
- apply fly sprays and insect repellants as needed.

[Owners should not get complacent about carefully observing their animals for signs of illness. Most of us are ready for mosquito season to end, but, in fact, mosquitoes are still out there. They still carry disease and can cause difficulty to you and your animals.

Vaccination is very effective and very protective. Please vaccinate your horses. - Mod.TG
