Food Chemical News published today the following explanation for the
Maryland outbreak [of salmonellosis that sickened nearly 750 people and
killed at least one.
Apparently the remaining raw ham tested positive for Salmonella, which is
not surprising considering USDA estimates that at least 6% of all hogs in
the country are so infected. This meat was then improperly prepared.
Food handlers packed the hams too tightly in cooking pots, creating uneven
cooking conditions, and only took the internal temperatures for a dozen or
so. The hams were then packed too tightly into freezers, not allowing
proper circulation of cool air, and thereby breeding the bacteria. Finally
a single slicer was used to cut the meat and since it was not sanitized
between hams the bacteria was easily spread. The resulting outbreak struck
more than 50% of the participants in the dinner. The single confirmed
death associated with the outbreak was an 81-year-old woman residing in the
country.

[Once again it is clear that it takes a cascade of mistakes in order to
create an outbreak of food-borne disease. I bet a holiday dinner that
there were also some mistakes on the farm and/or slaughterhouse. - Mod.PC
