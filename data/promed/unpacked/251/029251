Democratic Republic of Congo has sent its health minister and a team of experts to the remote northern Equateur province after several people died there from a disease with Ebola-like symptoms, a local official and a professor said on Wednesday [20 Aug 2014].

It was not immediately clear if there was any connection with Ebola [virus infections]. An epidemic of that disease has killed more than 1200 people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.

"An illness is spreading in Boende but we don't know the origin," said Michel Wangi, a spokesman for the governor's office. "The government has sent a team of experts from the INRB (National Institute of Biomedical Research) this morning led by the health minister (Felix) Kabange Numbi and acting governor Sebastian Impeto."

A professor accompanying the delegation in the presidential plane confirmed that they were en route this morning to find out "the exact nature of the illness that caused the Boende deaths".

An Equateur resident who asked not to be named said that around 10 people had died, including 4 health care workers, after suffering from fever, diarrhoea and bleeding from the ears and nostrils - all symptoms of the deadly Ebola virus [infection]

Highly-contagious, Ebola can kill up to 90 per cent of its victims [The case fatality rate in the current West African outbreak is 55 per cent. Mod. TY] . There is no known vaccine and the few forms of treatment that exist are experimental.

Congo does not share a border with any of the countries affected by the virus in West Africa. But the country has seen several outbreaks since the 1st case was detected near the Ebola River in northern Congo in 1976.

An unspecified number of people have recently died with Ebola-like symptoms in the northern province of Equateur in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the virus was discovered in 1976, according to Reuters. The deaths have not been connected to the outbreak in West Africa, located about 2000 miles [3200 km] away and the epicenter of the worsening Ebola crisis.

The DRC has sent its health minister and a team of experts to Equateur to investigate the deaths in the province of 7.5 million. The Ebola virus first identified there in 1976 is the most deadly of the 5 strains of Ebola [virus] and was known as the Zaire ebolavirus prior to 2010. It was the same strain of the virus that is currently ravaging Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.

About 318 cases were reported and 280 people died during the 1976 outbreak. The DRC has experienced 6 outbreaks of Ebola since then, mostly recently in 2012 when 36 people died in Equateur's neighboring province, Orientale. The Ebola virus has killed 768 people in the DRC since it was discovered.

Experts believe Ebola made its way into the human population through the consumption of bush meat, or the meat from the variety of animals found in the African wilderness. The primary host of the virus is believed to be forest bats, which are popularly stewed, smoked and roasted in rural West and Central Africa.

[The clinical picture described for these cases is compatible with Ebola virus disease. As the above reports indicate, Ebola virus is endemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC] and there have been sporadic outbreaks there over the past nearly 40 years. There was an unconfirmed but suspect outbreak of Ebola-like disease in neighboring Orientale province last month (July, 2014; see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140721.2624831). This current DRC outbreak is quite distant from the West African outbreak, and there is no evidence that the 2 are related, especially since the DRC Equateur outbreak is reported to be in an isolated location. It is unguent to confirm (or discard) Ebola virus as the etiological cause of the disease occurring there. These types of outbreaks can get out of control quite quickly. ProMED would appreciate receiving further information about additional cases and results of laboratory tests.

There is a map in the 2nd report showing the location of Equateur province. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of the DRC can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2708860,194. - Mod. TY]
