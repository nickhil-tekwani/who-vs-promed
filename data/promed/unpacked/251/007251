Local leaders are now calling on government to embark on a mass vaccination in northern Uganda to control the spread of hepatitis B, which has become endemic in northern Uganda and has wreaked havoc in many families, forcing children out of school.

A resident of Pebuka in Alebtong district are among those for whom the disease has had far-reaching impact. Seven of his children tested positive for hepatitis B, and this has put a financial and emotional strain on the family.

[With a scenario of 7 children found to be HBV-infected, it is extremely likely that all of them where infected neonatally from a HBeAg positive, HBV-infected mother. Interruption of the vertical transmission of HBV, which usually occurs from a maternal-neonatal transfusion from breakdown of the placenta, requires hyper-immune HBV globulin at birth and immediate vaccination for HBV. - Mod.LL
