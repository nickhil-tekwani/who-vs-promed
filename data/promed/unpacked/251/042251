[1] Nigeria (Adamawa): IDP camps
Date: Thu 15 Jan 2015

The Adamawa Government has on [Thu 15 Jan 2014] confirmed the outbreak of measles in some Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps in the state. Mr Haruna Furo, the Executive Secretary, Adamawa State Emergency Management Agency, confirmed the development to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Yola. Furo, however, said that there was no dead recorded. "There is outbreak of measles not just in the IDPs camps, but also within the community," said the scribe.

He listed the affected camps as the NYSC Camp at Bajabure, Girei, and Malkohi camps in Girei and Yola North local government areas, respectively. He attributed the outbreak to the daily mass movement and influx of new IDPs from Borno and the Cameroon mountains into the various camps across the state. "Not minding the fact that some of these Internally Displaced Persons came across the borders where they were into hiding for quite sometimes escaping from insurgent attacks. "Some came down from top of mountains between Nigeria and Cameroun borders where they had been trapped for 2 to 3 weeks; so these type of ailments are bound to be with them," Furo said.

He assured that the cases were not beyond the medical team in the camps and that they were working hard round the camps as well as the host communities to curtail the spread of the disease. According to Furo, routine immunisation days were being conducted by the primary healthcare workers, state Ministry of Health, NEMA [National Emergency Management Agency], Red Cross, and some other agencies for victims in the camps.

"We have competent medical teams that are attending to all the cases," Furo said. According to him, the agency was yet to ascertain the exact number of the affected persons.

Another measles case has been reported in Mitchell [Davison County] and the Department of Health is warning residents to make sure their immunizations are up to date and to watch for rash and other symptoms. As with previous cases, the individual was unvaccinated and a member of the same extended family group. The time periods and locations where other community members may have been exposed to the case are the Avera Queen of Peace Hospital waiting room from 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. on [7 Jan 2015] and the Casey's General Store on 1st and Main from 2 to 4:30 p.m. on [10 Jan 2015]. The department is working directly with the individual's workplace to identify any contacts. This latest case brings the total number of cases in the outbreak to 13, with 9 Mitchell area residents and 4 out-of-state residents.

"Please make sure your immunizations are up to date. If you were potentially exposed to this case and become ill, don't just assume it's flu, it could be measles," said Dr Lon Kightlinger, state epidemiologist for the department. "Call ahead to your doctor and tell them you may have been exposed to measles." Measles is a highly contagious airborne viral disease transmitted from one person to another by direct contact or droplet spread. It is a serious illness that causes permanent brain damage in one in every 1000 patients and is fatal in 3 out of every 1000 patients.

The best protection against the disease is the measles vaccine (MMR; measles, mumps, rubella). For full protection, 2 doses of the vaccine are recommended, the 1st at 12 months of age and a 2nd dose by age 4. 2 doses of the MMR vaccine are required for students entering schools in South Dakota. MMR vaccination is also required for children entering child care and for college entry.

The recent measles outbreak [in Sonora, California] has grown to 19 people. As previously reported, State health officials linked the outbreak to people who visited Disneyland or Disney California Adventure between 15 and 20 Dec 2015.

Tuolumne County's Health Officer Dr Todd Stolp has this concern, "The issue relevant to Tuolumne County is that we do have one of the lower rates of completed vaccination for children. Because of that, we encourage people to update their vaccinations, especially children for measles, mumps, and rubella, as well as other childhood vaccines."

State health officials confirm only one of the current patients had been fully vaccinated against the virus. Of the 19 measles cases, 16 are in California, 2 are in Utah, and 1 is in Colorado. Dr Stolp says symptoms include a rash starting on the face, high fever, and discharge from the eyes. In 2000, measles was declared cleared as an epidemic disease, but clusters of outbreaks continue due to people traveling, according to Dr Stolp.

The measles outbreak happened at a vulnerable place and at a bad moment. Disneyland was filled with holiday tourists from around the world the week before Christmas [17-20 Dec 2014] when someone with measles spread the disease. With its packed walkways, long lines, and enclosed spaces, the theme park offered prime conditions for measles to spread and travel as visitors returned home. Since then, at least 26 patients have been identified in California, Utah, Colorado, and Washington state, and there are probably more out there. Health officials said the outbreak was the worst in California in 15 years, in part because it occurred not in a small, insular community but at a crossroads of the world.

"Disneyland -- this is the ideal scenario. This is sort of the perfect storm," said Dr James Cherry, a UCLA expert on pediatric infectious diseases. "People go to Disneyland, and they went from all different counties and all different states." Quelling the outbreak has taken on special urgency as measles cases have increased dramatically in the last year and as child immunizations have dropped. This decline has come amid fears of some parents that the vaccines can cause autism, a theory that has been discredited by numerous scientific reports.

A "significant number" of the Disneyland patients involved people who were not immunized, said Dr James Watt, who heads the California Department of Public Health's division of communicable disease control. The Disneyland cases come months after another measles outbreak involving travelers returning from the Philippines. Dr Gil Chavez, the state's epidemiologist, said in that case, many of the patients "had not been immunized, either because their parents had declined childhood immunization for them or because they were too young."

The problem is now spreading as those who visited Disneyland between 17 and 20 Dec 2014 have gotten on planes and returned home to far-flung places. In Grays Harbor County, southwest of Seattle, an unvaccinated young woman was diagnosed with measles. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and nearby Snohomish County are also on alert after an unvaccinated California woman in her 20s flew to see family while contagious.

Utah officials have tracked down more than 380 people who could have come in contact with 2 vacationers who got the measles and asked many of them to quarantine themselves at home for 21 days. In Colorado, one older adult became infectious after returning to the Colorado Springs area; it was the 1st case in the state's El Paso County since 1992.

Disneyland measles outbreak spreads to 22 cases statewide. Officials in California and the nation are scrambling to get ahead of the outbreak, mapping out scenarios and identifying public locations where contagious people have been. Those places include a Ralphs grocery store in San Clemente, a Starbucks in Laguna Beach, and the Morongo Casino Resort & Spa in Cabazon. Long Beach investigators interviewed the city's lone measles patient and put out a public alert for unvaccinated people who went to Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Stater Bros., or Total Wellness Club on East Spring Street in the late morning of [3 Jan 2015]. Controlling measles is difficult, because the patient is infectious as soon as coughing and sneezing begins but before the telltale rash appears -- first on the head, then spreading to the rest of the body. Patients can be 4 four days before the rash appears and 4 days after, said John Holguin, epidemiology program supervisor for Long Beach. Other symptoms include fever, redness of eyes, and runny nose. Those affected in the Disneyland outbreak range in age from 7 months to 57 years.

It has been the worst year for measles, both nationwide and in California, since domestic transmission of measles was eliminated in 2000. There were at least 644 cases of measles nationally in 2014, up from 189 in 2013. In California, there were 70 cases last year [2014], up from 18 the previous year. Since 2000, US cases of measles have arrived from travelers from other parts of the world where measles is a problem, such as Europe and Southeast Asia. Eventually the disease transmission is snuffed out by vaccinated people. But experts warn that declining vaccination rates are starting to pose a big risk. For many years until 2006, about 95 percent of California's kindergartners were fully vaccinated for measles. That number has dropped to 92.6 percent -- low enough to be dangerous. California kindergartners are required to get vaccines but can get a medical or "personal belief" exemption.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known and can be especially severe in babies, toddlers and adults. For every 1000 children who get measles, one or 2 will die from it, and one will get brain swelling so severe it can lead to convulsions and leave the child deaf or mentally retarded, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Offit recalled the 1988-91 national measles epidemic. In California, there were about 75 deaths, most involving babies and children under the age of 5. Philadelphia saw 9 children die in February 1991 in an outbreak centered on churches whose members didn't vaccinate their children. In Ohio last March [2014], an unvaccinated Amish humanitarian aid worker came back from the Philippines with the measles, causing an outbreak that infected more than 380 people. The disease was stopped only by a robust campaign by health officials to administer 12 000 vaccination doses in the predominantly Amish community. That was the largest outbreak of measles in the US in the last 15 years, said CDC measles expert Paul Gastanaduy. "It's tricky with measles. You have to get ahead of the outbreak," he said. "The way to stop it is to try to anticipate as much as possible who's going to be susceptible and vaccinate them as quickly as possible." But the challenge with the Disneyland outbreak, he said, was the sheer number of people who visited from so many different places. "It becomes a distinct outbreak from a single community," he said. "How big and severe it will be, it's hard to say."

In addition to the 3 other states, there are now 22 measles cases in California related to the Disneyland outbreak, in the counties of Alameda (3), Los Angeles (3), Orange (9), Riverside (2), San Bernardino (2), San Diego (2) and Ventura (1). At least 6 people have been hospitalized.

Disneyland said it is fully cooperating with health authorities.

Date: Thu 15 Jan 2015

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/disneyland-measles-case-count-up-to-33-73717/


The measles outbreak linked to visiting 2 California Disney theme parks, Disneyland and Disney California Adventure Park, has grown to 33 cases in 4 states, according to numbers from the respective health departments. The majority of the current outbreak has been seen in California residents as that number is now 29. The breakdown by jurisdiction is as follows: Alameda (3), Los Angeles (5), Long Beach (2), Orange (10), Pasadena (1), Riverside (2), San Bernardino (2), San Diego (3) and Ventura (1). In addition, 2 cases have been reported in Utah and one each in Colorado and Washington. In El Paso County, Colorado, health authorities say they have identified nearly 300 people who may have been exposed to a patient with measles in Colorado Springs in early January [2015].

Of the more than 250 people contacted to date, El Paso County Public Health has identified a small number of individuals (fewer than 10 people) with high exposure and who do not have proof of immunity. Because of their lack of immunity, these people are at the highest risk of developing the disease and transmitting it to others. As a precaution, Public Health has arranged for these individuals to remain at home for a quarantine period of 21 days after their last exposure to the patient. All individuals are cooperating and have agreed to stay home and be monitored.

Experts say that places like Disneyland, where millions visit annually, are the ideal place to get a measles outbreak started. "This is the ideal scenario," said pediatric infectious diseases expert James Cherry. People go to Disneyland "from all different counties and all different states." The measles virus is transmitted by respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing, and is so contagious that 90 percent of people in close contact with an infectious person will get the disease if they're not immunized. Symptoms of measles include a fever of 101 deg F [38.3 deg C] or higher, cough, runny nose, and a rash that spreads to cover he body. The rash usually occurs within 2 weeks of exposure. 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine (MMR vaccine) are more than 99 percent effective in preventing measles.

[6] USA (California): update
Date: Sat 17 Jan 2 015

Evidence suggests that the latest measles outbreak has spread beyond people who visited Disneyland between 17 and 20 Dec 2014. The measles outbreak centered in California is rapidly expanding, with officials now confirming 51 cases of the illness -- nearly double the number reported [Tue 13 Jan 2015] -- and warning that more people will probably fall sick with the highly contagious virus. Officials said there was now evidence that the measles outbreak had spread beyond people who visited Disneyland between 17 and 20 Dec 2014 and begun infecting people in the broader community.

It is the beginning of a scenario experts have feared. Health officials generally hope a measles outbreak can be contained within a manageable group of people and eventually extinguished by keeping the ill at home or in a hospital room until they recover, with the outbreak eventually being stopped by the broader community of vaccinated people. But kindergarten measles vaccination rates have been falling almost every year since 2002 in California, and the virus now appears to be spreading.

Hardest hit has been Orange County, home to Disneyland. On Friday night [16 Jan 2015], county health officials said there were 6 new cases of measles diagnosed among people who did not visit Disneyland before Christmas. State officials said there were 2 more such cases in Ventura County, and one in Alameda County. In a statement, Orange County health officials said "the identification of 6 measles cases with acquisition from unknown community contacts indicates exposure to measles is more widespread throughout the county." They added: "The Health Care Agency expects that the measles outbreak will continue to spread." The Orange County health officer, Eric Handler, warned that students not vaccinated for measles may be excluded from attending school or day-care to prevent further spread of disease. A person who may have been contagious with measles was at Huntington Beach High School on [7-8 Jan 2015].

There are now 16 confirmed cases in Orange County. San Diego County has 10 and Los Angeles County has 8, followed by Alameda County with 4, Ventura with 3, and Riverside and San Bernardino, both with 2, for a total of 45 measles cases in California. The 6 other confirmed cases are residents of Colorado (1), Utah (2), Washington state (2), and Mexico (1), a 22-month-old unvaccinated girl who visited Disneyland between [16 and 18 Dec 2014]. Officials have said many of those ill were not vaccinated for measles. In the San Diego County cases alone, 9 of the 10 who fell ill had not had the measles-preventing shot.

For more than a decade, measles has been considered eliminated from the United States and the rest of the Western Hemisphere, meaning domestic transmission of the disease does not occur here. Measles has still been a problem when brought in by travelers from Western Europe and Southeast Asia, but the disease has been eventually extinguished by a ring of vaccinated people. But health officials have long expressed fears that progress against measles was threatened by a growing anti-vaccination movement in the United States, based on parents' fears that the measles vaccine causes autism -- a theory that has been thoroughly discredited by numerous scientific studies. Health officials say the measles vaccine is very safe.

"The greatest threat to the US vaccination program may now come from parents' hesitancy to vaccinate their children. Although this so-called vaccine hesitancy has not become as widespread in the United States as it appears to have become in Europe, it is increasing," Dr Mark Grabowsky, a health official with the United Nations, wrote last year [2014] in the Journal of the American Medical Association-Pediatrics. "Many measles outbreaks can be traced to people refusing to be vaccinated; a recent large measles outbreak was attributable to a church advocating the refusal of measles vaccination." A [Los Angeles] Times analysis published last September [2014] reported that the rise in vaccine exemptions among kindergartners because of parents' personal beliefs was most prominent in wealthy coastal and mountain communities, such as southern Orange County and the Santa Monica and Malibu areas. Health officials are urging people suspected of having measles to first call their health provider before going to a clinic, enabling caregivers to make special preparations so patients don't risk infecting others in the waiting room. An urgent care clinic in the San Diego suburb of La Mesa was forced to shut down on Wednesday when five people arrived with the telltale rash.

Officials said that the best prevention is inoculation; the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963 in the United States. In California, 2 doses are required for children entering kindergarten, but parents can obtain a waiver for a child by submitting a "personal belief exemption." Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known and can be especially severe in babies, toddlers, and pregnant women, and other adults as well. Especially vulnerable are infants less than 12 months of age, who are too young to get their 1st dose of the vaccine, known as MMR for measles, mumps and rubella. For every 1000 children who get the measles, one or 2 will die from it, and one will get brain swelling so severe it can lead to convulsions and leave the child deaf or mentally impaired, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. A 1988-91 measles outbreak caused about 75 deaths in California alone, most involving babies and children under age 5.

[The preceding press reports originating in California are representative of the alarm caused by this incident and the general unawareness of many American citizens that a dangerous childhood disease could originate and spread from such a benign and unthreatening source as a Disneyland theme park. Unlike other outbreaks of measles in recent years, this Disneyland outbreak has the potential to rapidly affect unvaccinated children resident in many communities remote from initial site of infection. On the positive side, this incident may persuade the minority of Americans with unvaccinated children to change their attitude. Paradoxically the attenuated measles virus vaccine is one of the safest, if not the safest vaccine currently available for any human disease. - Mod.CP]

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/philippines-measles-death-toll-hits-110-in-2014/


The Philippines was hit hard by measles virus infection in 2014. The number of fatalities due to measles on the archipelago reached at least 110, according to the latest World Health Organization update. The report states that there were 57 564 suspected cases of measles, including 21 403 confirmed cases reported in the Philippines from 1 Jan through 20 Dec 2014. The World Health Organization and the Philippines Department of Health are working to control the outbreak, including conducting vaccination campaigns.

Measles is a highly contagious airborne viral disease transmitted from one person to another by direct contact or droplet spread. The most important clinical predictors are the following features: generalized maculopapular rash, usually lasting three or more days, and fever (at least 38 deg C [100.4 deg F], if measured) present at the time of rash onset, and cough or coryza [irritation and inflammation of the mucous membrane inside the nose], or conjunctivitis. Measles is transmitted by airborne droplets and direct contact with discharges from respiratory mucous membranes of infected persons and less commonly by articles freshly soiled with nose and throat secretions. Measles is highly infectious and can persist in the environment for at least 30 minutes.

The incubation period is variable and averages 10 days (range: 7-18 days) from exposure to the onset of fever, with an average of 14 days from exposure to the onset of rash. The infectious period of patients with measles is 5 days before, to 4 days after, the appearance of the rash. It is a serious illness that causes permanent brain damage in one in every 1000 patients and is fatal in 3 out of every 1000 patients.
