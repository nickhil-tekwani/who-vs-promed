A new infection of the deadly H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus among
domestic fowls has been discovered in Egypt, the official news agency
MENA reported Saturday.
The Health Ministry said that new infection was discovered in Luxor,
some 680 km south of Cairo. Tests on domestic birds at the city's
Najaa al-Abayda Lab turned up positive for the H5N1 virus, said the
ministry's spokesman Abdel-Rahman Shahin.
The area has been quarantined and the birds were being culled, he said.
On 30 Oct 2006, an Egyptian woman died of bird flu virus and became
the country's 7th fatal human case of the disease.
Egypt reported the 1st human bird flu case 18 Mar 2006. Since then, it
has detected 14 human cases with the last case reported on 18 May. Of
the 14, 6 died while the rest recovered.

[The woman who died on 30 Oct 2006, allegedly after slaughtering and
handling domestic poultry, was from the town of Samanoud in the
governorate of Al Gharbiyah, which lies in the Nile Delta, more than
700 km north of Luxor, the location of the current outbreak in
poultry. We might be observing the top of an H5N1 iceberg, mainly
affecting small-holder farms concentrated in Egypt's countryside along
its lifeline, the Nile. The structure of this industry, namely a huge
number of small holdings, is the background to the unfortunate
situation when humans, sometimes, are sentinels of bird infection.
According to Egypt's official government's bird-flu web-site, at
<http://birdflu.sis.gov.eg/html/flu01001.htm>:
"H5N1 virus has been identified in 21 governorates since its initial
introduction earlier this year, namely in Cairo, Giza, Qalyubiya,
Daqahliya, Alexandria, Beni Sueif, Qena, Beheira, Menoufiya, Kafr
el-Sheikh, Gharbiya, Menya, Damietta, Sharqiya, Fayyoum, Sohag, Luxor
City, Ismailia, Aswan and Asiut."

Shandong Province, east China, has reinstated round-the-clock bird flu
monitoring to prevent possible outbreaks as more and more migratory
birds fly over the province on their way further south.
Li Zhanpeng, head of the provincial wildlife protection center, said
that all 153 monitoring stations in the province were ordered to
report on a daily basis.
Local people were also called on to report deaths of wild birds to the
provincial wildlife protection center. Its telephone hot line number
is 0531-8855-7707, Li said.
Wild birds migrate through 8 routes around the world, 3 of which
traverse China. Migratory birds flying from East Asia to Australia
pass Shandong Province.
China has reported 9 outbreaks of bird flu in poultry this year, in
northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, north China's Shanxi
Province and Inner Mongolia, east China's Anhui Province, southwestern
Guizhou and Sichuan provinces and the central province of Hunan. [An

Since 2003 China has reported 21 human infections of bird flu which
have caused 14 deaths. Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO)
has recorded 256 human infections including 151 deaths as of 16 Oct
2006.
