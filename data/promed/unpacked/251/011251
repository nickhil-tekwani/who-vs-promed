Cholera outbreak in central Nigeria kills 17, perhaps over 50 deaths
--------------------------------------------------------------------
At least 17 people have died following an outbreak of cholera in the
central Nigerian state of Benue, health officials said on Tue 19 Apr 2005.
Residents said the death toll was much higher, adding that an average of 6
people had died each day of the infection in some parts of the farming
state in the past 10 days.
Health commissioner Michael Iduma said at least 10 people died in the state
capital Makurdi in the last 2 weeks after they were admitted to hospital
for vomiting and diarrhea.
7 others had died earlier in 2 separate districts. Cases of the deadly
disease in Africa's most populous nation, where the majority live on less
than a dollar a day, have been on the rise since late 2004 when the WHO
said 126 people had died of the infection. "The hospitals I visited
yesterday have a record of 10 deaths, but some people may have died at home
without their deaths being recorded," Iduma said.
Residents say more than 50 people, including children, have died in the
past week of cholera in Makurdi, located on the banks of River Benue, the
source of drinking water for many. In Mar 2005, at least 51 people died in
the south western state of Edo following an outbreak of cholera, an
intestinal infection spread by contaminated food and water.

Cholera downs dozens in Sao Tome
--------------------------------
3 people have died in a cholera outbreak in the West African island nation
of Sao Tome and Principe, and 74 have been taken ill since the end of last
week, officials said on Tue, 19 Apr 2005.
"It is a high rate for the health system of this island" of 140 000
inhabitants, said Dr Gilberto Frota, a health ministry official in the Agua
Grande district. The epidemic has been confined to the area of the Sao Tome
hospital, the most important on the archipelago, where safe drinking water
is scarce.
"The government will take all necessary steps to avoid the illness
spreading to other districts," Alberto Santos, minister of trade, said,
standing in for the absent health minister.
Sao Tome, a former Portuguese colony, which hopes to benefit from future
oil revenues, at present depends on outside aid for 80 per cent of its income.

43 students hit by food poisoning
---------------------------------
43 primary school pupils were rushed to the RIPAS Hospital yesterday, Tue,
19 Apr 2005, after suffering from alleged food poisoning shortly after
recess at about 10 am.
According to the headmistress of the school, the pupils from primary 2, 3
and 4 of Dato Marsal Primary School in Kg. Perpindahan Lambak Kanan
experienced vomiting and diarrhea. "However, 33 pupils were later
discharged while the other 10 were hospitalised at Ward 3 of the hospital.
4 ambulances were rushed to the school," she said.
The headmistress added that the food and drink supplied to the school on
that day included packet drinks and cake rolls. The school canteen also
sells food and drinks that are permitted by the Ministry of Education.
There are also vendors selling food outside the school compound.
"We are yet to determine the source of the food poisoning. After performing
the midday prayer, the students undertaking the integrated school session
from morning until afternoon were told to go back early at noon," the
headmistress added. The headmistress also told the Bulletin packet drinks
supplied to the school had valid expiration dates on them. As a result of
the incident, all schoolteachers were told to stay back and had to skip
their lunch. The Public Relations Unit of the Ministry of Education, when
contacted, confirmed receiving the report.
In a statement, the Public Relations Unit of the Ministry of Education
said, "The headmistress has alerted the relevant departments and sections
at the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health. All parents were
notified immediately by the school authorities. An immediate investigation
is currently being carried out by the Ministry of Education with the
cooperation of the Health Division of the Ministry of Health."
The statement added that samples of food consumed by the pupils have been
sent to the RIPAS Hospital to ascertain the cause of the alleged food
poisoning.
