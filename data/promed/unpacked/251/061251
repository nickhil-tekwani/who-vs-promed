Some 13 people have been infected with cholera in Iran, Disease
Management Center director Hossein Masoumi Asl was quoted as saying by
iribnews.ir. He said the necessary precautions are being taken, and in
general, their condition is satisfactory.

He said the infection cases mainly were revealed in the Iranian
provinces of Sistan-Baluchistan, Fars, Khuzestan, and Hormuzgan.
Doctors took samples from relatives of ill persons, but no infection
was found.

The country has been recording cases of cholera infection for nearly
45 years, he said. The number of such cases was 15 in 2010. Asl said
cholera has not spread throughout the country.

A sudden outbreak of cholera in south eastern Afghanistan has killed
at least 14 people and infected dozens more, local media reported. The
Pajhwok Afghan News (PAN) agency reported that the epidemic in
southern Zabul province broke out earlier this week, infecting at
least 84 people. 14 of them have died, according to deputy governor
Mohammad Jan Rasulyar.

Few details about the outbreak in the remote area were immediately
available, but a spokesperson for the NATO-led International Security
Assistance Force (ISAF) said it airlifted several locals in relation
to the outbreak.

"ISAF did air transport 5 local nationals with dehydration symptoms,"
the spokesperson said. "It has not been confirmed if they are infected
with cholera. The [Ministry of Health] has the lead in this matter."

At least 29 people have been killed in an outbreak of cholera in the
western Bolobo region of the Democratic Republic of Congo since the
end of May 2011, health authorities said on Wednesday 15 Jun 2011.

The fatalities formed part of a total of 483 cholera cases which have
been registered in Bolobo since 31 May 2011, said Delly Mangombo, the
chief medical officer for the region in Bandundu province.

"Bolobo has an ongoing problem with its drinking water," Mangombo
told AFP. "The whole population gets its water from the river (Congo)
and whenever there is low water of the river, there is always
diarrhea," he said, adding that it was the 5th major outbreak in the
region in 50 years.

A team from the Belgian branch of Medecins Sans Frontiers
(MSF/Doctors Without Borders) is currently in the city of Bolobo to
help local medical teams cope with the outbreak, Mangombo said.

The United Nations says flooding around the Cote d'Ivoire's
commercial capital [Abidjan] is threatening at least 27 646 people,
and dozens of cholera cases have been reported.

The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said
on Tuesday [21 Jun 2011] that UN, Red Cross, and government officials
are trying to find ways to relocate people from flooded homes in a
dozen communities around Abidjan.

Spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs said there is enormous need for new
shelter and other items as her agency prepares to help up to 10 000
families, while authorities look for longer-term solutions.

Byrs, speaking in Geneva, said the country's health officials had
confirmed 42 cases of cholera in the Koumassi district, including 10
cases in the past week [week ending 19 Jun 2011].
