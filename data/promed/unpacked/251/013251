Request for further information
We had several phone calls from persons in China with the question about an
outbreak of a rat transmitted disease (plague?) which has affected a
university campus and the officials recommend a series of vaccinations.
Unfortunately I am not informed about the precise location of this possible
outbreak.
Is there any verified information of such an epidemic?

[We have been unable to find any reports of an unusual illness in
China. Perhaps one of our subscribers in China might be able to enlighten
us if there have been any reports of a rat transmitted disease or other
unusual outbreak currently ongoing in China. Information on who is
affected, the symptoms and disease diagnosis if know, where the outbreak is
occurring, would be very much appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
