Notice to readers: nosocomial _Burkholderia cepacia_ infections
associated with exposure to sublingual probes; Texas, 2004
----------------------------------------------------------
_Burkholderia cepacia_ (formerly known as _Pseudomonas cepacia_), a
Gram-negative rod, is attributed to nosocomial infections among
intensive care unit patients and associated with use of contaminated
equipment and solutions (1-4).
In August 2004, the Texas Department of Health received reports of
positive cultures for _B. cepacia_ from respiratory samples of 13
intensive care unit patients receiving mechanical ventilation at a
hospital in Texas during April - August 2004. None of the patients
had cystic fibrosis, a condition commonly associated with _B.
cepacia_.
Initial investigation by the hospital's infection-control team
revealed that nearly all of the patients had been exposed to a
sublingual probe indicated for use for monitoring tissue carbon
dioxide levels. The probe, an SLS-1 Sublingual Sensor, is part of the
Nellcor(r) CapnoProbe(tm) Sublingual System (model N-80 monitor), an
FDA-regulated medical device (Nellcor, Pleasanton, California). Each
probe is packaged in a metal canister filled with a buffered saline
solution and sealed in a foil envelope labeled as nonsterile. Each
disposable sensor is used only once.
Cultures of the buffered saline solution from at least 2 lots of
unopened probes yielded _B. cepacia_ and other bacilli. _B. cepacia_
isolates from some patients, and from unopened sensor canisters, were
indistinguishable by pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis at the
Texas Department of Health laboratory. Investigations into other
reports of _B. cepacia_, and other Gram-negative bacilli that might
be associated with use of the probes, is ongoing at hospitals in
Texas and California. The manufacturer has issued a voluntary recall
of all SLS-1 Sublingual Sensors.
Clinicians should be aware that patients exposed to these probes
might have been exposed to various organisms, including _B. cepacia_.
Recovery of _B. cepacia_, or of Gram negative rods that might be
related to the use of a sublingual carbon dioxide sensor, should be
reported to state health departments and the CDC's Division of
Healthcare Quality and Promotion, telephone 800-893-0485.
Health-care facilities are encouraged to report, through the voluntary
MedWatch reporting program, any events not reported under the mandatory
process. Additional information is available at
<http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdr/index.html>
or by telephone: 800-FDA-1088.
Users of this probe should return any existing inventory of unused SLS-1
Sublingual Senors by contacting Nellcor's Technical Services department,
telephone 800-635-5267, option 3.

Nellcor announces voluntary recall of all Capnoprobe(tm) sublingual sensors
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nellcor, part of Mallinckrodt, a Tyco Healthcare company, initiated a
voluntary recall of the CapnoProbe Sublingual Sensor. The sensor is
a non-invasive single-use device that is placed under the patient's
tongue to measure the carbon dioxide level in the tissue. The recall
was initiated following hospital reports of infections and the
finding of _Burkholderia cepacia_, a pathogenic bacterium, in the
buffered saline solution in which the probes are packaged. _B.
cepacia_ is an opportunistic pathogen in compromised individuals,
particularly those with cystic fibrosis or chronic granulomatous
disease. Symptoms include high fever, bacteremia, rapid progression
to severe necrotizing pneumonia, and death. Other potentially
pathogenic bacteria may also be present.
Nellcor tested inventory samples of the CapnoProbe sensor, after a
hospital recently alerted the company to a rise in infections
stemming from _B. cepacia_ 1st observed by the hospital among a group
of pediatric patients since April 2004. Reports from the hospital
indicated that CapnoProbe was used during the course of treatments on
11 of 13 patients infected. 2 of the infected patients have since
died, one from heart failure and one from pneumonia.
According to testing conducted by the Texas Department of Health, _B.
cepacia_ was detected from both the CapnoProbe device and the patient
isolates. It has not been confirmed whether the infection was
responsible for the patients' deaths.
"We are actively investigating, and committed to taking whatever
measures are necessary, to ensure the safety of our products and the
patients who use them," said David Sell, Nellcor president. "We are
committed to determine the root cause of this matter and resolving it
quickly."
Nellcor has shipped approximately 5600 sensors since launching the
product in the United States in January 2003, and the device is
currently in limited use nationwide in 60 healthcare centers. The
company is working closely with healthcare providers to recover the
product.
Earlier this week [1st week of September 2004], Nellcor contacted
every healthcare provider, by phone and facsimile, that had received
the affected product, providing information outlining the recall
process, and notifying them to cease use of the product and return
any inventory to Nellcor. The company has discontinued manufacturing
the product until the root cause of the contamination has been
determined and corrected. Clinicians, patients, or consumers with
inquiries should contact the Nellcor technical services department at
1-800-635-5267, option 3.

[_B. cepacia_ is a nonfermentative, aerobic, Gram-negative bacillus,
formerly classified as _Pseudomonas_. Unlike _Pseudomonas
aeruginosa_, _B. cepacia_ is an organism of low virulence with
limited ability to cause infection in humans.
_B. cepacia_ survives and multiplies in aqueous hospital
environments, where it may persist for long periods even in distilled
water and in certain antiseptic solutions such as quaternary
ammonium salts. It is often susceptible to trimethoprim plus
sulfamethoxazole, cefepime, meropenem, or imipenem, and has varying
susceptibility to fluoroquinolones.
The source of the contaminated saline is not clear at this point. - Mod.LL]
