IDEXX Laboratories announced today [14 Feb 2011] that infection with
the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus was confirmed in a 6-year-old cat in
Wisconsin. The cat's owner had recently been ill with flu-like
symptoms prior to the cat's illness. The cat developed severe
respiratory illness; despite aggressive treatment, the cat
deteriorated and was euthanized. A 2nd cat in the household also
developed severe respiratory disease and was euthanized due to failure
to respond to treatment; although samples from that cat were negative
for the virus, 2009 H1N1 influenza remains the presumptive cause of
illness and death in the 2nd cat. For more information read the IDEXX
industry alert at

[Until now, the last confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza infection in a pet
was reported in January 2010. These new cases serve as a reminder that
the virus is still circulating in the population and is still capable
of infecting people and pets.

The AVMA has updated their 2009 H1N1 resources, all of which are
available on the AVMA website.

The most important messages for clients at this time are not to panic
and to have any ill pets examined by a veterinarian, especially if
someone in the household has recently been ill with flu-like symptoms.
To date, all of the infected pets were infected by ill people, and
there is no evidence that ill pets have transmitted the virus to
people or other animals. Emphasize the importance of proper hygiene
and sanitation to prevent spread of the virus. Based on the currently
available information, ferret and cat owners should be especially
cautious. - Mod.TG
