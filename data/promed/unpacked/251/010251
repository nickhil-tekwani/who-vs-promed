A new outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] has been found at a privately held farm in a village in Russia's Primorsk[y] region near the border with China, Russia's agriculture watchdog [Rosselkhoznadzor] said on Friday [20 Sep 2019].

The virus -- which is highly contagious among pigs but not dangerous to humans -- has been detected in several areas in the region in recent months [see comment].

China has reported [157] outbreaks of the incurable disease since it was 1st found in the country in August last year [2018].

[Since 30 Jul 2019, 30 ASF outbreaks in domestic pigs have been reported from Russia's Far East, bordering China's Heilongjiang province; links to all relevant OIE reports from Russia and a map showing the 30 accumulated outbreaks in the Far East as of 12 Sep 2019 is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=31280 (please zoom in to the required resolution).

Russia's most recent follow-up report, no. 6, addressed 5 new outbreaks; one of them, dated 6 Sep 2019, related to a backyard holding including 2 pigs, of which one died and the other one was culled. This holding is located in the village of Zharikovo, Primorskiy Kray, the same province named in the above new (media) report.

Heilongjiang province has been reported as ASF infected since Aug 2018; notably, one of the events in this province, in December 2018, involved farmed wild boars in pasture (ProMED-mail archive no. 20181204.6179428). It would be interesting to note if surveillance in wild boar in this region, on either side of the Russian-Chinese border, has been applied.

Rosselkhoznadzor reported yesterday (19 Sep 2019): "ASF virus genome detected in sausage from China" (in Russian, http://fsvps.ru/fsvps/news/31959.html). The incident involved a Chinese citizen who "tried to smuggle infected pig products (carbonated meat sausage from lean meat)" at the checkpoint of the Zabaykalsk MAPP. The products were found ASF positive by PCR. The date of the incident is not given. - Mod.AS
