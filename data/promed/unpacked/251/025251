The mysterious outbreak of the new skin disease in Pernambuco [previously reported in ProMED-PORT. - Mod.SH] has affected more and more people. This Thursday [25 Nov 2021], 5 other cities in the state (Cabo de Santo Agostinho, Igaraso [Igarassu], Ipojuca, Itabisuma [Itapissuma], and Nazari da Mata) have reported cases of residents with symptoms such as itching and skin lesions. In total, 11 municipalities are affected by the disease, representing about 300 cases, according to city councils. In Recife, the first cases were recorded in early October [2021].

Symptoms include itching, bump-shaped lesions, and redness. The cause of the disease is not yet known, but investigations have been carried out by the city council and the health department of Pernambuco to find out the cause of the outbreak.

After a technical note was sent last Friday [19 Nov 2021] to the health services that all cases of skin diseases with their own symptoms should be reported for disease action mapping, SES-PE [Secretaria de Saúde de Pernambuco - Pernambuco state public health department], with the support of city halls, has sought to find the cause of the outbreak.

According to the department, the investigation was carried out by the technical team of SES-PE itself, from the Central Laboratory of Pernambuco (Lacen-PE) and other specialists. So far, the cause of the disease is unknown, but hypotheses include scabies, viral infections (dengue, Zika virus, chikungunya), allergic reactions and even environmental imbalances.

Cases were investigated in clinical, epidemiological and laboratory investigations, as reported on [19 Nov 2021] by the executive secretary of health surveillance, Marcela Abath, in a meeting with the State Department of Health and the Agio Magalhaes Institute. At a press conference on Thursday [25 Nov 2021], health minister Andre Longo confirmed that biopsies had been carried out in order to find out the cause of the disease.

[This increasing outbreak of itchy skin rashes that started in early October 2021 now involves about 300 patients in 11 cities in the north east Brazilian state of Pernambuco; 5 of the cities mentioned in the news report above are within about a 60 km (37 mi) radius of the city of Recife (population, 4 million), the capital and largest city in Pernambuco (population, 9.6 million in 2020) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernambuco):
- Cabo de Santo Agostinho (pop., about 200 000) is 35 km (22 mi) south of Recife;
- Igarassu (pop., about 118 000) is 32 km (20 mi) north of Recife;
- Ipojuca (pop., almost 100 000) is 57 km (35 mi) south of Recife;
- Itapissuma (pop., about 27 000) is integrated within the Recife metropolitan area; and
- Nazaré da Mata (pop., about 32 000) is 62 km northwest of Recife.

The following is a machine translation from the Portuguese of Mod.RNA's moderator comment (abridged) concerning this outbreak in Pernambuco on ProMED-PORT Exanthematic disease - Brazil (PE), outbreak, unknown cause (Archive Number: 20211122.8699816), at https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8699816:

"Generally speaking, the patients present with a skin rash, without fever and apparently without other clinical manifestations (there are no joint, ocular, respiratory or gastrointestinal signs/symptoms). The illness has a benign evolution, without the need for hospitalization, but it is important to collect information about time-person-place:
- What are the dates of symptoms in the first and last case?
- Are other signs/symptoms present/absent?
- What are the spatial and temporal distributions of the cases?
- Are there clusters of cases in home, school and/or occupational settings?
- Is there a history of environmental exposures (water, vegetation, insecticides, mists, other products or chemical substances...) in common?
- Were there any contacts with other arthropods, caterpillars?
- In addition to dengue, Zika and chikungunya, which other viruses were investigated? Enterovirus? Parvovirus? Other flaviviruses? Alphavirus?"

Dr Rodrigo Angerami (Mod.RNA) in his moderator comment raises the issue of skin reactions to caterpillars. Several species of moth caterpillars are covered in tiny barbed hairs, which are coated with a toxin that causes a dermatitis-type rash. In contact with human skin, they can cause pain, rashes, itching, burning, swelling, and blistering. For some caterpillars, the hairs are shed and become airborne, wafted along air currents. If inhaled, the hairs can cause asthma. See https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/IN014, https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/IN014, https://www.livescience.com/browntail-moth-caterpillar.html, and https://www.poison.org/articles/caterpillar-stings.

One example is the browntail moth caterpillar, which "has tiny poisonous hairs that cause dermatitis similar to poison ivy on sensitive individuals. People may develop dermatitis from direct contact with the caterpillar or indirectly from contact with airborne hairs. The hairs become airborne from either being dislodged from living or dead caterpillar or they come from cast skins which the caterpillar molts. Most people affected by the hairs develop a localized rash that will last for a few hours up to several days but on some sensitive individuals the rash can be severe and last for several weeks. The rash results from both a chemical reaction to a toxin in the hairs and a physical irritation as the barbed hairs become embedded in the skin. Respiratory distress from inhaling the hairs can be serious. (https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/vector-borne/browntail-moth/index.shtml).

Outbreaks of reactions to moth caterpillars in Brazil (Santa Catarina State) have been reported by ProMED in the past (see alsos in 1996 below). More information from knowledgeable sources on this current outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
