An anthrax-infected man has died in University Hospital in Marrakech, Morocco. A medical source has stated that the person with anthrax, who was undergoing treatment at the Ibn Tufail Marrakech hospital campus, died on Saturday evening [4 May 2013; The initial report of this case was on 29 Apr 2013 in Al Ahdath Al Maghribia, but we were unable to access the original report. - Mod.MHJ].

The deceased had been transferred to Ibn Tufail [hospital] isolation facility days before because he was in serious condition, having been diagnosed with the disease (anthrax), which is transmitted from animals to humans, and to prevent him from receiving any visits due to fear of transmission to other people [This is unnecessary, because though anthrax is infectious, it is very rarely contagious. - Mod.MHJ].

The deceased manifested symptoms of the disease following the death of a cow in a stable on the farm [in the Qalaat Sraghna region. - Mod.MHJ]. At the request of the deceased, the cow's liver was extracted to make sure of the cause of death before the burial. Shortly after this, he (the deceased) started to show symptoms of the disease, which advanced progressively and necessitated his transfer to hospital.

The doctor at the University Hospital in Marrakech [Ibn Tufail] said that the patient, aged 34 years, was relocated from outside Marrakech to the hospital too late to save him from the effects of the bacteria, as he had suffered significant damage to internal organs, and it was too difficult to treat them.

A medical source said, on condition of anonymity, that this case is not the 1st of its kind recorded in the territory outside Marrakech and that anthrax had already caused the deaths of 12 people in the same region within the past year.

The current medical information about the disease, known by other names such as Altfhamih fever, malignant edema, and navy wool disease, is an occupational disease transmitted to workers in the leather and wool industries, and veterinarians and farm workers who come into contact with animals carrying the bacteria that cause the disease.

The skin becomes infected through contact with tissues of infected animals (cattle, sheep, goats, horses, pigs) which have died because of the disease, or through touching contaminated hair, wool or leather. The bacteria can infect the lungs when spores or contaminated dust are inhaled, or the gastrointestinal system by the eating of contaminated meat. The disease spreads between herbivores through contaminated soil and food.

[There is a very important leather and wool preparation and dyeing industry in Marrakech. Moroccan leather is world famous. But anthrax is considered an occupational disease by people working in the Moroccan wool and hide industries.

From the official OIE statistics, this is nominally a sporadic disease of low frequency in cattle and sheep/goats in Morocco: from 2006 to 2012, there were just 0 to 5 cattle outbreaks with 3 to 16 cases, and in 2008 and 2009, just 3 outbreaks, with 16 goats affected in Centre Sud in 2009 and 17 sheep in Est in that same year. Human cases were only reported in 2007 (27, with 7 deaths) and 2009 (8 cases). The comment of 12 deaths in "the past year" makes one suspect that the official statistics may be deficient. The OIE statistics had no human cases during 2010 through 2012. Maybe it should be considered enzootic in Morocco.

The earlier report stated: "The patient had symptoms including fever, pustules and skin ulcerations in different body areas. He was transferred to a number of hospitals and finally to the Ibn Towfeil's University Hospital Intensive Care Unit. It was reported that the patient contracted the disease from an unvaccinated [cow]. The problem for the worker started when cows started dying on the farm and were culled. The cow's body was burned. The cattle and other animals on the farm were moved to an unknown destination. Cattle were also reported to have died in other parts of the region" (Al Ahdath Al Maghribia, 29 Apr 2013). Extracting the liver from an anthrax carcass would present an extreme exposure. Usually, a cotton swab dipped in the animal's blood is perfectly adequate for any diagnostic laboratory.
