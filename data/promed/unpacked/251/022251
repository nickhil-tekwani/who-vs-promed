Strangles has been reported at 2 facilities in Georgia by an attending veterinarian. One facility, located in Crawford County, has reported 3 horses affected, with 10 exposed. Clinical signs include nasal discharge, coughing, and swollen legs.

The 2nd facility, located in Lowndes County, has reported one horse affected and 16 exposed. Clinical signs include nasal discharge, fever, being off feed, and lethargy. Both facilities are under quarantine.

["Strangles is caused by bacterial infection with _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _equi_ (referred to as _S. equi_). The bacteria typically infect the upper airway and lymph nodes of the head and neck.

The hallmark clinical signs of infection are fever (temperature over 101.5 F [38 C]), nasal discharge, and enlarged submandibular lymph nodes (in the space between the lower jaw bones), which ultimately abscess. This is a highly contagious bacterial infection, generally treated by antibiotics and rest. Therefore, isolation of those barns is appropriate to contain the disease, as is close attention to the animal's temperature.

Antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Most authors agree that initiation of antibiotic therapy after abscess formation may provide temporary clinical improvement in fever and depression, but ultimately prolongs the course of disease by delaying maturation of abscesses. Antibiotic therapy is indicated in cases with dyspnea, dysphagia, prolonged high fever, and severe lethargy/anorexia (loss of appetite). Administration of penicillin during the early stage of infection (up to 24 hours after onset of fever) will usually abort abscess formation. The disadvantage of early antimicrobial treatment is failure to mount a protective immune response, rendering horses highly susceptible to infection after cessation of therapy. If antimicrobial therapy is indicated, procaine penicillin (22 000 IU/kg, intramuscular injection, twice a day) is the antibiotic of choice."
