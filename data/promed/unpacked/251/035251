Three dogs have died after drinking water from Lake Champlain which lies
between western Vermont and eastern up-state New York. The water was laden
with blue-green algae. State epidemiologist in both states are testing
algae samples to determine the toxin. Necropsies are scheduled. The lake
has been particularly warm and low this year and there is also suggestion
that algae blooms are more common when there is significant nutrient
run-off from fertilizer and manure.

Lake Water Alert Given - (LAKE CHAMPLAIN) -- State health authorities are
warning pet owners to keep their animals from drinking water from Lake
Champlain. The warning comes after the death of 3 seemingly healthy dogs
over the past few days. Officials say the deaths may be the result of a
toxic substance and they are concerned that it could be blue-green algae
found in the lake water. Officials also say they have absolutely no
evidence of any human illness caused by the algae.

[Many species of cyanobacteria produce populations that are toxic to humans
and animals. Blue-green pond scums have been linked to the poisoning of
cattle and dogs, and occasionally people. It is therefore not recommended
that wild populations be gathered and eaten without some knowledge of the
organisms involved. Some species of cyanobacteria appear to be non toxic
and are harvested as a food source. Cyanobacteria may cause other problems
as well; a species of _Lyngbya_ is responsible for one of the skin
irritations commonly known as "swimmer's itch."
It seems the health authorities would recommend people and animals avoid
further exposure to that area of the lake. Lake Champlain is a very large
and historic body of fresh water. It is possible the deaths took place on
one area of the lake. Nevertheless, people should keep their pets out of
the water and swimming in that area is unwise. - Mod.TG]
