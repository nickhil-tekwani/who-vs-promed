Health scare in Gauteng
-----------------------
3 people have died following cases of an infectious disease in
Johannesburg, the Health Department said on Sunday [5 Oct 2008].

"We are on high alert following the confirmation of 3 cases of an
unknown highly infectious disease which has since led to 3 deaths,"
said the department in a statement.

According to the department the 1st patient was a female from Zambia
who was critically ill when she arrived on [12 Sep 2008] in South
Africa. She was treated for tick-bite fever and other potential
infections at Morningside Medi-Clinic. "2 days later she died. Blood
samples were taken and the results
were not conclusive of any particular disease including the viral
haemorrhagic fevers."

Flu-like symptoms
-----------------
The 2nd patient was a Zambian male paramedic who had accompanied the
1st patient. He was admitted on [27 Sep 2008] at the same facility
with flu-like
symptoms and treated for a variety of infections. "His condition
initially improved, but later deteriorated on Wednesday, [1 Oct 2008]
and he died the following day [2 Oct 2008]."

Investigations for viral haemorrhagic fever and other formidable
infectious diseases were conducted and the results came out negative.

A nurse at Morningside Medi-Clinic who came into contact with the 1st
patient became ill with flu-like symptoms and was subsequently
admitted to Sir Albert Robinson hospital in the West-Rand on Wednesday
[1 Oct 2008]. "Her condition deteriorated on Saturday [4 Oct 2008]
and she passed away today (on Sunday [5 Oct 2008]). Viral haemorrhagic
fever and other formidable infectious diseases were negative."

Healthcare workers monitored
----------------------------
According to the department, systems were in place to follow up on
everyone with whom the deceased had had contact.

Healthcare workers and family members were being monitored for raised
temperatures and flu-like symptoms for a period of 21 days.

"Steve Biko Academic and Charlotte Maxeke Academic hospitals are on
high alert and ready to handle any cases related to this situation."

Members of the community with travel history to Zambia during the
last month and who suffer from raised temperatures or flu-like
symptoms are requested to report to the nearest health facility for a
medical examination or contact Dr Chika Asomugha on 082 330 1490.

[From the above description of the illness, it is difficult to develop
a narrow differential diagnosis -- a disease that is a febrile disease
with flu-like symptoms that is apparently highly fatal, occurring in
Africa has one immediately thinking about the possibility of a viral
hemorrhagic fever (even though hemorrhagic symptoms were not
specifically mentioned in the newswire). As one of the world's top
reference laboratories for viral hemorrhagic fevers is located in
South Africa, the information that testing for the known hemorrhagic
fevers gave negative results means one can comfortably remove the
known hemorrhagic fevers from the differential diagnosis list.

From the above description of the dates of onset, it appears the
disease has an incubation period of between 2 and 4 weeks. The mode
of transmission is not clear (respiratory vs contact with bodily
fluids).

One might suspect that it is contact with bodily fluids, [because if
respiratory] one might have expected to see more cases by now (with 3
generations of cases most likely described in the above newswire).
However, on reviewing ProMED-mail archives, in November 2007 there was
an outbreak of presumed pneumonic plague in Southern Zambia. Borrowing
from ProMED-mail Mod.LL's comment at that time, "Patients with primary
pneumonic plague generate large quantities of infectious aerosols that
pose a significant risk to close contacts. CDC (US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention) guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters
(6.5 feet) as being at greatest risk and do not consider the organism
likely to be carried through air ducts or vents." (see ProMED-mail
posting Undiagnosed deaths - Zambia (02): pneumonic plague susp.
20071130.3862). Of note is that the incubation period for plague is 1
to 14 days, possibly shorter than noted in the above given dates of
onset of the 3 cases.

A review of all ProMED-mail prior postings on events in Zambia
revealed the overwhelming number of reports were related to
veterinary outbreaks (such as foot & mouth disease, contagious bovine
pleurpneumonia and swine fever), the next most common reports were of
zoonotic diseases affecting both human and animal health (anthrax,
rabies, plague), and next, person to person or food and waterborne
transmitted diseases (measles, cholera, diarrhea). There was one
scare of a possible hemorrhagic fever outbreak but it was ruled out as
attributable to 3 different diseases -- schistosomiasis, gum disease
and pneumonia. (see prior ProMED-mail posting Re: Ebola - Zambia?
19950626.0458).

ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate receiving more information on
these cases from knowledgeable sources in the region.

outbreaks of anthrax, cholera and diarrhea.]
