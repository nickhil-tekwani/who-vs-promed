Japanese encephalitis [JE] which broke out for the 1st time in
Nalbari district has so far claimed one life at Barkuriha village
under Barbhag Revenue circle. The deceased was aged about 74. He was
admitted to Gauhati Medical College Hospital (GMCH) with high fever
where he was diagnosed with Japanese encephalitis. One more patient
from the village is undergoing treatment at the hospital.

The surfacing of his fatal disease has created panic among the people
of these areas. The people have alleged that the District Health
Department has taken no serious steps to combat it. The district
malaria department sprayed DDT only among 4 families. The district
malaria officer opined that as the area is not included in the action
plan for spraying DDT, they have no right to spray DDT without the
permission of the higher authority. On the other hand the district
health department, though, sent a bugging vehicle to the affected
village but it miserably failed to discharge smoke due to some
mechanical defect. Even, the deputy commissioner of Nalbari who is
the president of district health society or the joint director of
health services is yet to visit the affected village, which is
situated only 8 km [5 mi] away from Nalbari town.

The panic stricken villagers on Sunday [1 Aug 2010] organised an
awareness meeting at Barkuriha LP school inviting health and malaria
officials. The awareness meeting presided over by Dr Biren Deka was
addressed among others by Dr Kamal Dev Goswami, health officer of
Kamarkuchi PHC [primary health care], Dr Gokul Patowary, IDS [India
Development Service], Nalbari, Dipak Tamuli, district malaria
officer, Rajib Sarma, media expert NRHM [National Rural Health
Mission], and Ashok Kalita, panchayat [village assembly] president.

The panicky villagers demanded the health department to immediately
administer Japanese encephalitis [virus] vaccine in the village. They
also demanded the district administration to shift the piggery farm,
the source of this virus, to a areas away from inhabited places.

[This report does not indicate if these JE virus cases were
laboratory confirmed or were presumptive diagnoses. Pigs are
amplifying hosts of JE virus and would have to be relocated well
beyond the flight range of the _Culex_ mosquito vectors to avoid
transmission to humans in the affected village. Wild birds are the
reservoir hosts of the virus. This report raises again the conflict
relating to use of DDT insecticide for vector control. The _Culex_
vectors of JE virus are abundant and widely distributed, making their
control with insecticides difficult logistically and costly.
