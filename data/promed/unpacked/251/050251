Foot-and-mouth disease, Uganda
------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 25 Jul 2014 from Dr Nicholas Kauta, Commissioner, Department of Livestock Health and Entomology, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, Entebbe, Uganda

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 13 May 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 7 Jul 2014
Report date: 25 Jul 2014
Reason for notification: Unexpected increase in morbidity or mortality of a listed disease
Summary description: The disease is spreading rapidly to many districts in an area that was not previously reporting foot-and-mouth disease.
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Foot-and-mouth disease virus
Serotype: O
This event pertains to the whole country

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive; introduction of new live animals; legal movement of animals; illegal movement of animals; contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering
Epidemiological comment: This observed change in pattern and epidemiology of the foot and mouth disease virus has coincided with increased cattle movement and climatic stress that has resulted into scarcity of pastures. Treatment of secondary bacterial infections with antibiotics.

Increased distribution
District / Species
Moroto / Cattle
Kumi / Cattle
Kaabong / Cattle

Disease impact
Increased / District / Species / Change
Incidence / Moroto / Cattle / 0.01 percent to 6 percent
Incidence / Kumi / Cattle / 0.03 percent to 6.2 percent
Incidence / Kaabong / Cattle / 0.01 percent to 7.2 percent
Morbidity / Moroto / Cattle / 0.02 percent to 60 percent
Morbidity / Kumi / Cattle / 0.01 percent to 67 percent
Morbidity / Kaabong / Cattle / 0.03 percent to 56 percent

Control measures
Measures applied: Stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; no treatment of affected animals; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s):
Administrative division / Species / Total vaccinated / Details
Kumi / Cattle / 10 000 / Trivalent vaccine (SAT 1, 2 and O)
Moroto / Cattle / 13 000 / Trivalent vaccine (SAT 1, 2 and O)
Kaabong / Cattle / 8000 / Trivalent vaccine (SAT 1, 2 and O)

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Animal Disease Diagnostics and Epidemiology Center (NADDEC), Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (national laboratory) / Cattle / antigen (Ag) detection (ELISA) / 7 Jul 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Information found in their annual report (January to December 2012) submitted to the OIE shows that Uganda reported 2 outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the eastern region (Kapchorwa and Amuria districts), where serotype O was identified; see http://tinyurl.com/oo66a22 (Note: go to Section 3 of the report named "Detailed quantitative information for OIE-listed diseases/infections present" to see detailed information on these outbreaks).

These recently reported outbreaks are located in eastern Uganda (Kumi district) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Region,_Uganda) and in northern Uganda (Kaabong and Moroto districts) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Region,_Uganda).

The following information was obtained from a presentation by Dr. Chrisostom Ayebazibwe, Eastern Africa Region Laboratory Network FMD Uganda focal person, August 2013. The complete presentation is available at http://tinyurl.com/m2xe64q.

According this presentation, "FMD has been reported in Uganda since 1953, and 6 out of the known 7 serotypes have been encountered over time, including A, O, C, SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3. Type O is dominant." In addition, he points out that the illegal movement of animals is the most incriminated factor associated with the spread of the disease; that while government policy for FMD control is quarantine and vaccination, the effectiveness of this policy is affected by the delayed vaccination response following an FMD outbreak (the average reactive time is 7.5 weeks); that existing vaccines are very expensive (about USD 1.20 per dose), and that a minimum of 5 million doses is required annually for preventive vaccination of multiple livestock species.

(Note: The increased observed incidence may likely be attributed to poor vaccination coverage and/or delayed response times.)

In his presentation, Dr Ayebazibwe also identified the following actions that would help control FMD in Uganda:
- Stakeholder sensitization
- Conduct regular and effective vaccination programmes based on the local knowledge of FMD occurrence
- Support national surveillance and laboratory investigations to clearly zone infected and high-risk areas
- Increase staff in the districts
- Provide the districts with the needed resources to collect samples and report FMD on time or to conduct vaccinations
- Have emergency preparedness capacity, information sharing and networking, particularly at the borders with neighboring countries, including Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan
- Implement regional coordination and harmonization of control efforts
- Conduct more research on the epidemiology of FMD -- circulating serotypes, effectiveness of vaccines, role of wildlife and small ruminants

This presentation contains a map of Uganda showing the relative occurrence of FMD outbreaks in Uganda during 2013. - Mod.CRD
