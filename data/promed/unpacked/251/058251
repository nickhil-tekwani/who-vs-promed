Follow-up report of the Swedish anthrax case in Orebro
------------------------------------------------------
A whole genome sequencing of the anthrax isolate from the dead cow showed a very high similarity to the isolates from the 2011 outbreak in the same area.

It was only 3 base pairs that differed in the 5.4 million base pair genome, and although the anthrax genome is known to be very stable, it strongly indicates that the case in 2013 is linked to the outbreak in 2011 when more than 20 animals died of anthrax.

A 5-year vaccination plan [was] undertaken for all animals grazing on the 2011 infected pasture. The now dead cow was up until her death still outdoors on a non-vaccination pasture approximately 1 kilometer [0.6 mile] outside the vaccination area. Investigations into the source of infection have excluded transmission by water since the pasture is upstream from the wetland area infected in 2011. No wild boars are frequenting the land, but roe deer and birds are present.

Vaccination of the remaining 54 animals in contact with the dead cow was carried out on Friday, 1 Nov 2013. No signs of illness have been reported from the group so far.

[Our thanks to Marianne for this informative update on this recent singular case in Sweden.

Over the years I have noted an unfortunate but not infrequent aspect to outbreaks that gather attention. The neighboring farmers will lean on their fences or watch from the road as the outbreak is dealt with, and ignore the odd dead cow on their own property for whatever good or bad reason. In this Orebro incident it could have been because being "1 kilometer" outside where all the vaccination activity was going on, it was not presumed to be "anthrax." Time catches up with these overlooked events, as it may well have done this time. This is why I advise that vaccination response programmes should reach out a minimum of 5 km (about 3 miles) from all known affected farms and for 3-5 years at least. The cost is trivial and the benefits significant.
