A 49-year-old woman has been diagnosed with plague, the 4th case in
La Plata County in 2006, health officials announced Mon, 25 Sep 2006.
The 4 cases -- all caused by fleas brought in by family pets, health
officials suspect -- equal an annual record for the entire state.
Nationally, 10 to 15 cases of plague occur in humans every year. New
Mexico has already seen 7 this year, resulting in 2 deaths. The most
recent case struck in the Grandview area, said Joe Fowler, regional
epidemiologist for Southwest Colorado.
So far in 2006, 13 rodents and cats in southwest Colorado have tested
positive for plague. Cats become infected from flea bites or by
direct contact with infected rodents. Plague-infected cats generally
have a history of roaming freely in rural areas, the San Juan Basin
Health Department said in a news release.
Plague reappeared in Colorado residents in 2004 after a 3-year
absence. 3 cases were reported in 2004, none in La Plata County. In
2005, 2 of the 3 cases in the state were found in La Plata County.
Plague season in southwest Colorado extends through October. Health
officials recommend taking steps against fleas to reduce the chances
of contracting the disease.
"People need to realize it really does happen to normal people around
southwest Colorado," Fowler said.

[_Yersinia pestis_ infection in humans continue to be reported in the
southern USA with more cases recognized this year. Although not
stated, the case was probably one of the bubonic variety. The
finding of cases in animals in Colorado as early as Feb 2006 was an
indicator that more human cases might be diagnosed in 2006. La Plata
county is found in the southwestern part of the state on the
following map:
