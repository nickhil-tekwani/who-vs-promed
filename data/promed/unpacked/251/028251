Salmon disease outbreak feared
------------------------------
The Scottish Executive is investigating a suspected case of infectious
salmon anaemia (ISA) in a fish farm in South Uist, the 1st case for 5 years.
The Executive said the presence of ISA is suspected at Marine Harvest's Loch
Sheilavaig salmon farm. Fish health inspectors are investigating, and
statutory restrictions are in place controlling the movement into and out of
the farm of all fish.
A spokesman for the Executive's environment and rural affairs department
said that Marine Harvest is taking action to minimise risk and ensure the
health of its fish.
An outbreak of ISA in Scotland in 1998-99 is said to have cost the salmon-
farming industry 37 million GBP [70 million USD] and almost 200 jobs. The
industry employs about 6000, mainly in the Highlands and Islands.

[Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) is an infectious disease of Atlantic salmon
(_Salmo salar_) caused by an orthomyxo-like virus. Initially reported in
Norway in the mid-1980s, ISA has to date been reported in Canada (New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia), the United Kingdom (Scotland and the Shetland
Islands), the Faroe Islands, and USA (Maine), and the causal virus has been
isolated from samples from Coho salmon from Chile and from rainbow trout in
Ireland. The disease has been recorded in Norway earlier in 2004.
ISA is one of the 16 notifiable fish diseases listed by the OIE; further
details may be found in chapter 2.1.9. of OIE's manual of Diagnostic Tests
for Aquatic Animals, <http://oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/A_00026.htm>. -
