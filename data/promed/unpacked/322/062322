Early childhood education and care (ECEC) services in Far North Queensland have been asked to be on the alert for cases of a serious respiratory illness after 378 confirmed cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have been detected since 1 Jan 2021, compared with 88 for the whole of 2019 and 70 in 2020.

The spike in cases follows a recent warning from authorities about a rise in hand-foot-mouth disease, another illness easily spread in ECEC services, and has left health authorities "questioning whether lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic have fallen by the wayside."

More than 70 per cent of the confirmed RSV cases have been in children under 10 years of age. The virus generally causes a minor cold-like illness in older children and adults, but in younger children, it's a common cause of bronchiolitis.

Dr Neil Archer, Cairns Hospital clinical director of paediatrics, said it's particularly serious for babies under 3 months of age or in children who have other medical issues.

Symptoms include a runny nose, cough, fever, sore throat, and headache. In infants, the above symptoms may be present along with not feeding as well, or breathing more quickly or with more effort.

Someone who has RSV is normally infectious from when they start to show symptoms to 7-10 days after symptoms develop.

ECEC services "have been singled out as the main place of transmission," with good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette important measures to prevent the spread, Dr Archer said, including washing hands regularly with soap and water after touching surfaces or after coughing or sneezing and covering the mouth and nose with an elbow when sneezing.

Parents should be especially mindful of not sending children to ECEC services if they are unwell, to reduce the risk of further transmission.

Cairns and Hinterland Hospital and Health Services executive director of medical services, Dr Don Mackie, said the RSV outbreaks had led to record amounts of presentations at the hospital's Emergency Department in recent weeks.

"Since the start of January [2021], we have had 182 RSV presentations to the ED [Emergency Department], compared to just 33 for the whole of 2020 and 27 for the whole of 2019," he said.

"We have been able to cope with the increased demand in the short term, but we are still asking for Far North Queenslanders to be mindful of the pressure on local health services."

[For a possible explanation for the surge in cases in 2021, see https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/why-did-rsv-see-a-summer-surge-in-australia-this-y (abridged, edited) which proposes that COVID lockdown and personal protective measures led to a decrease in cases in 2020. Cases remained low due to continued border closures, important in reducing transmission from arriving overseas travellers. Once COVID-19 restrictions were reduced, RSV surged. Reduced immunity in the population also may be playing a role in the rapid increase in cases.

"Why did RSV see a summer surge in Australia this year? RSV is a common winter illness in children, but 2020 was different.

"Winter typically brings a surge in respiratory viral infections, when we see many children running around with runny noses and phlegmy coughs.

"But the 2020 Australian winter was very different. Public health measures in place to control the spread of COVID-19 saw a major shift in the typical seasonal pattern of other respiratory viruses.

"This has perhaps been most notable with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a very common cause of hospitalisation in young children over winter months in many parts of the world, including Australia.

"But following an abnormal winter that saw a significant drop in rates of RSV -- we found there were 98% fewer winter cases in Western Australian children -- paediatric hospitals around Australia have seen unexpectedly large numbers of children presenting with RSV over summer.

"So, what is RSV, and why are these changing trends important?

"A winter lurgy
--------------
"RSV typically circulates during winter in temperate climates, much like influenza.

"It's the major cause of lung infections in children, commonly causing bronchiolitis. Symptoms of RSV include a runny nose, cough, reduced feeding and fever. Complications include wheezing and difficulty breathing, which can develop into pneumonia.

"Severe cases occasionally lead to death, predominantly in very young infants.

"Almost all children have had an RSV infection by age 2, but infants in their 1st year of life are more likely to experience severe infections requiring hospitalisation, because their airways are smaller. Babies have also not built up immunity to RSV from previous years (we call this being RSV-naïve).

"RSV is spread through respiratory secretions, when an infected person sneezes or coughs. In this way it's similar to COVID-19. But in contrast to the coronavirus, children are more vulnerable to RSV infection than adults. As a result, RSV is readily spread among children, especially at day care, kindergarten and school.

"How is RSV treated?
-------------------
"Most children will recover without needing specialist care in hospital, and children with mild infection can be treated with rest at home.

"However, many children, particularly young infants, those born prematurely, and children with underlying health issues, are admitted to paediatric wards with severe RSV every year.

"Treatment for RSV is focused on helping children with their breathing (for example, giving them oxygen) and feeding (for example, administering fluids through a drip).

"There's no licensed vaccine for RSV, but the World Health Organization considers this a priority, and a number of vaccines are currently in development.

"What happened to RSV in 2020?
-----------------------------
"The stay-at-home orders across Australia from late March 2020, and the implementation of quarantine for international arrivals, coincided with the start of the usual RSV and influenza season in Australia.

"With these measures in place, RSV and influenza cases dropped dramatically and remained very low throughout winter.

"In Western Australia, despite a relaxation of COVID-related restrictions, including schools reopening from May 2020, there was still a dramatic reduction in RSV cases through winter. This suggests border closures were important in reducing transmission from arriving overseas travellers. RSV cases remained low until late spring, when a large surge was observed in New South Wales and Western Australia.

"The speed and magnitude of this increase was greater than the usual winter peak of RSV.

"More recently, other states including Victoria and Queensland have seen a similar unseasonal rise in RSV cases.

"It's likely reductions in COVID-19 restrictions have opened the door for increased RSV spread.

""Reduced immunity to RSV may also have contributed through both an increase in the number of RSV-naïve children and possibly waning RSV immunity in older children related to the delayed season.

Studies seeking to understand exactly why we've seen a rise in RSV cases are ongoing.

"Why might the Australian surge be important elsewhere?
------------------------------------------------------
"Australia's experience may carry important lessons for Northern Hemisphere countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, which saw similar reductions in RSV cases during their winter.

"Relaxing of COVID restrictions, which is beginning in many Northern Hemisphere countries now, may provide an opportunity for the rapid spread of RSV. Our experience should serve as a warning for paediatric hospitals in the Northern Hemisphere to ensure adequate staffing and available resources to meet the possible increased need.

"Our RSV experience may also be applicable to influenza, which still remains at very low levels globally.

"Reduced immunity to influenza due to the skipped 2020 season may result in a very severe season when influenza returns. Seasonal influenza vaccines could be particularly important in 2021 to protect against a possible large resurgence."
