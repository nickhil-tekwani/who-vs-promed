Health authorities say far north Queensland is heading for a record
number of imported cases of dengue fever.

There are 2 active outbreaks -- one in the Cairns CBD [central
business district] and another at Mount Sheridan, just south of the city.

Tropical Regional Services spokesman Brad McCulloch says he is
concerned about the high number of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes
breeding in some Cairns suburbs. The mosquito is responsible for
carrying dengue fever [virus].

"We're tracking for a record number of imports this year [2010] --
we've had, I believe, 27 imports already this year," he said. "Our
annual record for a year is 28 and obviously we've still got a few
months of 2010 left. We are seeing an increased number of imported
cases of dengue as [it] becomes more and more prevalent across the
tropical world. Obviously having a high base number of mosquitoes
present in the community provides an opportunity then for those
imported cases to go on and infect other people," [McCulloch said].

[This report is confusing. It indicates that there are 2 active
outbreaks, yet the health official is quoted as being concerned about
imported cases with out comment about ongoing local transmission. If
there are locally acquired cases, it would be of interest to know
when the outbreak began and how many cases have occurred.

The [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced 3 new cases
of indigenous dengue fever Monday [16 Aug 2010], 2 of which were
contracted from the original patient, who, according to CDC
officials, is a 41-year-old female living in Tainan County's Guanmiao
Township, who [was] confirmed as a type 1 dengue [virus] patient.

According to the CDC, there have been 15 cases of indigenous dengue
fever since March [2010], and CDC deputy director-general Chou
Chih-hao said the peak season for the disease this year might begin
earlier than usual.

CDC officials urged the public to clean up mosquito breeding sites
around their residences as the most effective means of preventing
transmission of the disease

Negros Occidental [Western Visayas] governor Alfredo Maranon Jr told
the chief executives of 8 towns and cities whose number of dengue
cases is already within the outbreak level to take drastic measures
to address the problem.

Dr Ernell Tumimbang, officer-in-charge of the Provincial Health
Office (PHO), identified the "dengue hotspot" barangays [barrio, the
smallest administrative division in the Philippines]. Dengue cases in
these areas have been steadily increasing for the past 4 weeks,
Tumimbang noted. The latest records at the PHO showed that 20
Negrenses died of dengue while the number of cases went up to 2872
for the period of January to 7 Aug this year [2010], compared to only
671 cases with 13 recorded fatalities during the same period last year [2009].

The number of dengue fever cases in Da Nang City this year [2010] has
increased 7.17 times against the same period last year [2009], to
1377 cases including one death, according to the city Preventive Health Centre.

The Da Nang City People's Committee has ordered departments, sectors
and localities to take measures to prevent the spread of the disease.

Gia Lai Province has had 1100 cases of dengue fever this year [2010],
and the disease has increased rapidly since May [2010]. The
provincial Preventive Health Centre, in cooperation with the Tay
Nguyen Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, has conducted an
inspection and found that 37.8 percent of local households have mosquitoes.

[The newswire above reports dengue outbreaks in the central city of
Da Nang and the central highland province of Gia Lai. Although the
newswire reports the number of dengue fever (DF) cases in Da Nang
city in 2010 to be much higher than the same period in 2009, no
monthly data for 2010 are reported, so it is difficult to know if the
dengue outbreak in Da Nang in 2010 is still increasing. There are
also no reported data to make a comparison regarding number of dengue
fever cases in Gia Lai during 2010 with the same period in 2009.

The newswire also reports the results of a recent inspection, which
found that 37.77 percent of local households have mosquitoes.
However, it does not report the types of mosquitoes identified.

The most recently updated report from the Viet Nam Ministry of Health
(available in Vietnamese at <http://bit.ly/8XoM8s>) reported a
decrease in the number of DF and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases
in the whole country compared with the same period in 2009.

According to the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific
(WHO/WPRO) report, available at
<http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/mvp/data/dengue/>, there were a total
of 105 370 cases and 87 deaths from DF/DHF reported in Viet Nam during 2009.

Mosquito-borne dengue fever has killed 36 people in Laos this year
[2010], the worst epidemic in at least 5 years, the World Health
Organization (WHO) said Friday [20 Aug 2010]. "It's a big epidemic
year for dengue here," WHO epidemiologist Hannah Lewis told AFP from
Laos. She said that in the last 5 years the highest annual number of
reported deaths was 22, with about 10 to 15 deaths the norm.

However, Lewis said there appeared to be no particular cause for the
increase, and that dengue epidemics were cyclical. The last severe
epidemic in Laos was 7 years ago, she said, adding that "many other
countries in the region also have this same pattern." The communist
government has been taking appropriate measures, including
prevention, fumigation, education and clinical training, she said.

Laos, with about 7 million people, is one of Asia's poorest nations.

The number of dengue cases is highest in the last 6 years. Delhi on
Saturday [21 Aug 2010] recorded the highest single-day incidence of
dengue this season with 36 more patients testing positive for the
disease, taking the total cases to 384. According to statistics
released by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the number of cases
till this time in 2009 was only 3. The figure was 55 and 12 in the
same periods in 2008 and 2007 respectively.

[The 21 Aug 2010 edition of ProKerala News
<http://www.prokerala.com/news/articles/a161008.html> said that up to
Saturday (21 Aug 2010), the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) said
that 384 dengue cases had been reported. However, the figures quoted
by the capital's private hospitals present a vastly different
picture. MCD Medical Officer NK Yadav is quoted as saying they only
take into account the cases tested for dengue using the IgM capture
ELISA test. "Private hospitals generally don't conduct this test as
it is expensive, so we don't take into account their cases," he
added. This policy doubtless leads to significant underreporting of
dengue cases and deaths. It does, however avoid including false
positives in the dengue case totals. The 19 Aug 2010 edition of News
One India
<http://news.oneindia.in/2010/08/19/dengue-hits-new-delhi-4000-cases-reported.html>
indicated that there were 4000 dengue cases reported in Delhi,
especially in Jamia and Okhla, the worst hit region in the capital.

Over 2000 suspected cases of dengue fever have been reported in
Shabwa governorate, 474 km [295 mi] east of the capital Sana'a, a
source from the health office in the governorate told local press on
Sunday [15 Aug 2010]. The source said that one of the cases had
passed away, while 309 out of 2200 suspected cases were confirmed
positive. Many Yemeni governorates are witnessing the spread of this
epidemic including Taiz, Aden, Abyan, Lahj, and Shabwa, according to
a June 2010 report issued by the ministry.

Marshes resulting from rain and the leakage of sewage are the main
causes for the spread of mosquitoes that are transmitting the
epidemic, according to the heath official. [_Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes, the dengue virus vectors, do not breed in marshes or in
sewage The rains likely produced clean water catchments in which the
dengue virus vector mosquitoes were reproducing, as mentioned below
in this report. - Mod.TY]

In July [2010], the government reported that dengue fever had claimed
the lives of 12 people in Hadramout and 1142 were infected with the
disease [virus]. A Saudi medical team visited Hadramout in June
[2010] and said the lack of modern testing equipment complicated
diagnostic efforts.

Dengue fever is transmitted by mosquitoes and education campaigns
should highlight the danger of stagnant water, open containers of
liquid, and standing rainfall in areas where mosquitoes breed.

[8] Japan ex Benin

We have recently confirmed one case of dengue fever in a traveler
returning from the Republic of Benin, where the disease has not been
reported since 2006 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20080825.2646).

The patient was a previously healthy 28-year-old Japanese female who
left Japan on 23 July [2010] and visited Cotonou, Dassa-Zoume,
Parakou, Natitingou, and Porto-Novo in the Republic of Benin between
24 Jul-3 Aug 2010. She arrived back in Japan on 4 Aug 2010 and
noticed sudden fever on the next day after her returning. The
associated symptoms were headache, diarrhea, bilateral myalgia of her
thighs, and bilateral arthralgia over her knees, shoulders, and
elbows. Physical examinations were normal except mild bilateral
tenderness over her thighs and knees. A rapid dengue NS1
immune-chromatographic test (SD BIOLINE, Korea) was positive. So she
was admitted to our hospital for close observation. Follow-up
laboratory data showed the lowest platelet count of 48000/uL. She was
discharged without any residual symptoms after a 6-day hospitalization.

Dengue virus type 3 was detected by real-time PCR and isolated by
cell culture. Anti-dengue IgG and IgM antibodies were negative on the
day of onset and became positive 8 days after onset.

This case suggests that endemic areas of dengue virus type 3 are
expanding in West Africa as a previous report of dengue virus type 3
detected in Cote d'Ivoire (Emerg Infect Dis. 2009 Nov; 15(11): 1871-2.)

Chief public health inspector for the [Portland] parish, Caram

mosquito-borne disease because laboratory tests had not yet been
completed. Ramtulla said more time was needed for the medical
laboratory to accurately diagnose the 6 cases. "We at the Ministry of
Health have intensified our programmes to deal with the dengue virus
and all areas where the suspected cases have derived from will be treated."

The Ministry of Health announced on Thursday [18 Aug 2010] that 9 new
people might be infected with dengue type 4 virus, bringing to 12 the
number of suspected cases in Roraima. Up to now, 3 cases of the
disease have been confirmed, all in the capital, Boa Vista. The
Secretariat of Health Surveillance added that 2 tests, RT-PCR and
isolation in C3/36 cells, are needed to confirm the dengue virus 4 genome.

The spread of dengue virus type 4 in Brazil brings with it the
likelihood of a "major epidemic" in the country, according to the
coordinator of the National Dengue Control of Ministry of Health,
Giovanini Coelho, since the vast majority of the population never had
contact with this virus and therefore has not developed immunity to it.
