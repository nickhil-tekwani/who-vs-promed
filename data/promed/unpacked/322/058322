Extensively drug-resistant _Salmonella_ Typhi infections among US residents without international travel
------------------------------------------------
Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is providing
1. information on extensively drug-resistant (XDR) _Salmonella_ Typhi (Typhi) infections among US residents without international travel, and
2. treatment recommendations for XDR Typhi infection.

Background
Typhoid fever is a systemic illness caused by the bacterium _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi (Typhi). Most people in the US diagnosed with typhoid fever acquired it during international travel, but some acquired it in the US. The disease is treated with antibiotics; without appropriate antibiotic treatment, 12-30% of people with typhoid fever will die.

Typhi is transmitted through contaminated food and water and person-to-person contact. CDC recommends vaccination for people traveling to places where typhoid fever is common. Because typhoid fever vaccines are not 100% effective, travelers should always practice safe eating and drinking habits to help prevent infection.

In 2016, a large outbreak of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Typhi infections began in Sindh province, Pakistan [1]. XDR Typhi strains are resistant to antibiotics generally recommended to treat typhoid fever, including ampicillin, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Isolates from patients linked to the outbreak in Pakistan are susceptible to carbapenems and azithromycin. Infections among travelers to or from Pakistan have been reported globally, including in the US.

As of 14 Jan 2021, CDC has received 71 reports of XDR Typhi infection in the US, with specimens obtained from 9 Feb 2018 through 16 Nov 2020. Among 67 patients with known travel history, 58 (87%) had traveled to Pakistan in the 30 days before illness began (Figure).

Nine (13%) patients from 6 states (NY [3], CA [2], IL, MD, NJ, and TX) reported that they had not traveled to Pakistan or any other country. Specimens from these 9 patients were obtained from 7 Nov 2019 through 7 Oct 2020, with 8 obtained in 2020. Susceptibility testing of these specimens showed the same resistance pattern described in Pakistan. CDC has not identified linkages among these patients or a common source of infection.

Case reporting of US Typhi infections for 2020 is not yet complete. To date, 17 states have reported Typhi cases for 2020 compared with 39 states for 2019. Among 11 patients without international travel in 2020, 8 patients were infected with XDR Typhi, one patient was infected with non-XDR Typhi, and susceptibility testing is pending for 2 others.

Before the outbreak in Pakistan, no case of ceftriaxone-resistant Typhi infection had been identified in the US [2]. An unrelated cluster of ceftriaxone-resistant Typhi infections linked to Iraq has been reported in the US and the UK [2].

Clinicians should consider empiric treatment with a carbapenem, azithromycin, or both agents for suspected typhoid fever in patients who did not travel out of the US and for those who traveled to Pakistan or Iraq. Ceftriaxone remains an appropriate empiric treatment option for patients who traveled to countries other than Pakistan and Iraq. Clinicians should adjust treatment based on results of susceptibility testing.

This investigation is ongoing.

A large, ongoing typhoid fever outbreak caused by XDR _Salmonella_ Typhi began in Hyderabad (Sindh province), Pakistan, in November 2016 and has spread to most provinces throughout the country (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/xdr-typhoid-fever-pakistan). Cases of XDR typhoid fever caused by this strain have been reported in residents of the USA as well as other countries (e.g., Canada, the UK, Denmark, and Australia), after returning from travel to Pakistan (See ProMED see alsos below). This XDR strain of _Salmonella_ Typhi is resistant to most antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone) that are used to treat typhoid fever, but it remains susceptible to azithromycin and carbapenems. An unrelated outbreak of ceftriaxone-resistant Typhi infections linked to Iraq has been reported in the USA.

Since February 2018, 71 cases of XDR Typhi, with an antibiotic resistance pattern identical to that described in strains in Pakistan, have been reported in the USA. Most of the USA XDR Typhi cases had traveled to Pakistan in the 30 days before their illness began; however, since November 2019, 9 (13%) XDR Typhi cases from 6 states reported no international travel. CDC has identified no epidemiologic linkages among these cases, but no genotyping data is given in the report. More data on the sources for these cases is anticipated from the ongoing outbreak investigation.

Azithromycin has been shown to be effective for uncomplicated typhoid fever (https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/44/2/243/861087 and http://www.atmph.org/article.asp?issn=1755-6783;year=2017;volume=10;issue=1;spage=205;epage=210;aulast=Nair). Because XDR Typhi cases, without a history of international travel to Pakistan or any other country, are now being reported in the USA, the CDC is now recommending azithromycin for empiric therapy of all patients with suspected uncomplicated typhoid fever, and carbapenems for severe or complicated typhoid fever. Treatment regimens can be adjusted when culture and sensitivity results become available.

The majority of cases of typhoid fever in North America are associated with travel, particularly travel to South Asia. Those visiting friends or relatives are at a greater risk of travel-associated typhoid fever than tourists or business travelers (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/43/9/1185/425822). Studies have found travelers visiting friends and relatives accounted for 66% of typhoid fever cases in the United States (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/184464) and 94% of cases in Quebec (https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/18/6/373/1806353).

Travelers to places where typhoid fever is endemic, such as South Asia, should protect themselves against typhoid fever by getting a typhoid fever vaccination and taking extra care to follow safe food and water guidelines, even when visiting friends and family. - Mod.ML
