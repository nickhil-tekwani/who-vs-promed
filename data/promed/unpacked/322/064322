In order to complete your information about the surveillance of
communicable diseases in Europe, I would like to inform you that
a European multicenter network of surveillance of Influenza already
exists : European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (www.eiss.org)
You can find further publication in Snacken R, Manuguerra JC, Taylor
P. European Influenza Surveillance Scheme on the Internet. Meth
Inform Med 1998, 37: 266-70. Herewith the abstract:

In 1995, The European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS) was created
with the participation of eight networks from seven countries. The
main objectives were to continue the previous CARE Telematics Network
and to adapt the project to the Internet environment as well as to
improve substantially the quality of the surveillance according to new
epidemiological requirements. Clinical and virological data from the
general population and hospitals are collected in an interactive real
time database which can then be used for data entry, queries and
consultations. Research programmes have been undertaken in various
fields such as standardisation of clinical data and comparability
between countries. Validation and security processes guarantee the
quality assurance as well as regular assessment by the steering
committee. Two additional countries will participate during the next
influenza season (1997-98). This will represent an early warning
system for a population of approximately 264 million inhabitants.
Other publications are in preparation.
This completes the list mentioned (IDS, the EuroTB programme,
ENTER-NET, and EWGLI (European Working Group on Legionella
Infections).
