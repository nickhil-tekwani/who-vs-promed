Horse disease found in Michigan
-------------------------------
Michigan animal health officials announced the 1st case of eastern equine encephalitis in a 3-year-old horse just across the Michigan-Indiana border.

According to Indiana's Board of Animal Health, horse owners in Indiana should be aware of the disease.

Indiana had no reported cases of EEE last year [2021]. However, the disease can pop any time, any place.

"Horses are not the only ones at risk of eastern equine encephalitis," according to a BOAH statement. "Like the more common West Nile virus, EEE can infect people and cannot be directly transmitted from infected horses to other horses or humans."

Signs of EEE include listlessness, high fever, head pressing, seizures and coma. Horses that develop it rarely survive. Contact a veterinarian if any of these signs are noticed.

The virus is maintained in the bird population and is transmitted by mosquitoes breeding in freshwater wetlands.

Prevention
----------
Preventing EEE infection in horses involves 2 main steps: vaccinating and minimizing exposure to mosquitoes.

Horse owners should work with their veterinarian to determine a regimen which includes selecting the best vaccine product given in a timely way.

Vaccinations are generally administered in the spring for season-long protection. Combination products will prevent several mosquito-borne viruses in a single dose.

Prevention is also accomplished by reducing exposure to mosquito bites.

Prevention tips:
• Eliminate sources of standing water where the pests breed -- even small amounts of water in old tires, clogged gutters, puddles, or stagnant water troughs can harbor insects.
• Keep livestock confined indoors with good ventilation during peak flight hours, from dusk to dawn.
• If using an insect repellent, select a product labeled for use on that species.

History of EEE in Indiana
-------------------------
In 2020, EEE infections were detected in 4 horses in LaGrange, Kosciusko and LaPorte Counties. One human case of EEE occurred in a LaPorte County resident in 2020.

In 2019, EEE infection was detected in 14 horses in Elkhart and LaGrange Counties. The infected horses were either not vaccinated or overdue on vaccination.

One fatal human case of EEE occurred in Elkhart County in 2019, and 10 human cases occurred in southern Michigan, 6 of which were fatal.

Two more horses test positive for EEE in Indiana
------------------------------------------------
On 30 Sep 2022, The Indiana State Board of Animal Health confirmed the 2nd and 3rd Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE)-positive horses in Northeast Indiana in 2022.

An unvaccinated 15-year-old mare in LaGrange County tested positive for EEE. She began showing signs on 23 Sep 2022 and presented initially with a 104-degree [40 deg C] fever but responded to treatment. Within 24 hours, however, she was down and did not have normal reflexes and was subsequently euthanized.

An unvaccinated 14-year-old mare in Kosciusko County tested positive for EEE, as well. She became ataxic (incoordinated) on 22 Sep 2022 and progressed to recumbency (down and unable to rise). She is since deceased.

Northern Indiana residents warned about mosquito-borne virus
------------------------------------------------------------
The mosquito-borne eastern equine encephalitis virus was detected in multiple northern Indiana counties, with 4 horses testing positive for the virus.

Health officials are warning northern Indiana residents to take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes after detecting a rare and potentially deadly mosquito-borne virus in the region.

State public health and animal health officials issued the warning Thursday [6 Oct 2022] after determining the eastern equine encephalitis virus was active in multiple northern Indiana counties, with 4 horses testing positive for the virus.

State veterinarian Dr. Bret Marsh said the virus "is a serious threat to both horses and people in northern Indiana" until the 1st hard freeze of the fall season occurs.

As of Tuesday [4 Oct 2022], the Indiana State Board of Animal Health said 2 horses in LaGrange County and 1 horse in Kosciusko County have tested positive for the virus.

No human cases of the virus disease or mosquitoes infected with the virus have been reported in Indiana this year [2022]. But officials said that because northern Indiana contains suitable habitat for mosquitoes that can transmit the virus "humans and horses in all northern Indiana counties are potentially at risk."

Residents were urged to avoid being outdoors when mosquitoes are present and take other steps, including eliminating breeding grounds for the insects.

While rare, the virus can cause serious illness and has a fatality rate of around 33% or higher, and many people who recover may still experience long-term complications, officials said. Symptoms of the virus disease include chills, fever, body aches and joint pain.

State Veterinarian Statement on Eastern Equine Encephalitis-Positive Eaton County Horse
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today [26 Sep 2022], State Veterinarian Nora Wineland, DVM, released the following statement due to the discovery of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) in a 2-year-old Paint cross gelding from Eaton County. This is the 1st case of EEE in Eaton County this year [2022].

"On 8 Sep 2022 the gelding became ill with neurologic signs -- including leaning, wobbling, and stiffness/trying not to move. The horse was unvaccinated against EEE and was humanely euthanized due to the severity of his condition.

This case shows the virus is present in the area's mosquitoes and highlights the need to take precautions. Protect animals against mosquitoes by placing livestock in a barn under fans during peak mosquito activity (from dusk to dawn), eliminating standing water on one's property, using an insect repellant on animals that is approved for the species, and contacting a veterinarian to vaccinate horses against EEE and other mosquito-borne diseases.

Also, please contact a veterinarian if a horse shows signs of the illness: mild fever and stumbling, which can progress to being down and struggling to stand."

EEE is a viral disease transmitted through the bites of mosquitoes to both animals and people; it is typically seen in late summer to early fall each year in Michigan. The disease is not spread by horse-to-horse or horse-to-human contact. Overall, the mosquitoes carrying EEE will remain alive and active until there has been at least 1 hard freeze where the temperatures fall below 28 degrees Fahrenheit [-2.2 deg C].

EEE is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the U.S. with a 90% fatality rate among horses becoming ill and a 33% fatality rate among humans who become ill.

For 2022, the gelding is Michigan's 3rd case of EEE in a domestic animal; the other cases occurred in Roscommon and St. Joseph counties. Also, there are currently no reported cases of EEE in humans.

EEE 101
-------
Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the Eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include:
- Avoid mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn.
- Look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol).
- Apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite.
- Mosquito-proof homes: Fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.
- Protect your horses: Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the U.S. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year [2022] to vaccinate your horses.
- Use approved insect repellents to protect horses.
- If possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
- Eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly.

Stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance), or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis_ st israelensis [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

[Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) is a mosquito-borne disease. It is preventable in equids (including donkeys and mules) with a vaccination. Unfortunately, the vaccine's protection against EEE has been shown to wane somewhat quickly requiring revaccination approximately every 3 months in areas where EEE is known to be.

The vaccine usually comes in combination of eastern and western equine encephalitis (EEE, WEE), tetanus and West Nile virus (WNV). There are also combinations with Equine Influenza (EI), and some with Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE). Your specific location may determine your best vaccine. Be sure to check with your veterinarian. Rabies is also a recommended vaccine for horses. But the key is repeat vaccine every 3-4 months especially for EEE. - Mod.TG
