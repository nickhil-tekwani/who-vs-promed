Thirteen people who ate chicken doner kebab in a restaurant in the YÄ±l District of Karabuk went to Karabuk University Training and Research Hospital and Safranbolu State Hospital with complaints of nausea, pain, and diarrhea. It was learned that the health status of the patients who were treated with the suspicion of food poisoning was good. On the other hand, it was reported that the teams of the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture and Forestry took samples from the chicken doner kebab in the restaurant for examination.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for this post.

The etiology of the presumed foodborne illness here is not stated. With presumed undercooked chicken as the vehicle, salmonellosis or campylobacteriosis are potential causes.

"Doner kebab is a type of kebab, made of meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie. Seasoned meat stacked in the shape of an inverted cone is turned slowly on the rotisserie, next to a vertical cooking element. The operator uses a knife to slice thin shavings from the outer layer of the meat as it cooks." - Mod.LL
