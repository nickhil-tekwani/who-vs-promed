MENINGOCOCCAL MENINGITIS, REPORTING (02)
========================================

As one of those `state health department' types referred to, I want to echo
Charlie's comment. [Which was, "Certainly these occurrences should be taken
seriously but one would assume that such outbreaks are reported to local and
state public health authorities and that they are investigated and treated
(the episode as well as the individuals). When you hear of such occurrences
or even rumors of such occurrences, rather than contact ProMED-mail, contact
your state or local health department, university health center, or other
appropriate organizations." -- Mod CHC]
Indeed, meningococcal disease does occur sporadically in school-aged kids,
from elementary on up and unfortunately, it occasionally (to often) results
in a death. This is guaranteed to stir the worst fears in the population in
general and parents in particular. It doesn't help that the media often use
such a tragedy to sell more newspapers.
The local and state health departments have (too much) experience in dealing
with this situation, and we have developed good methods to identify and
prophylax the folks who need it. If we get good reporting, we can get
prophylaxis started within 24 hours of the report.
The bottom line is that Charlie's advice to contact the Public Health
department in your area is right on. They should have the knowledge and the
resources to provide good information and advice in such cases.
