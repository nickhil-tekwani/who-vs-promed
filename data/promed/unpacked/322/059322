Officials at Clemson Livestock Poultry Health (CLPH) have confirmed the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) received positive test results for West Nile virus (WNV) in an unvaccinated 13-year-old Quarter Horse mare in Clarendon County.

This case marks South Carolina's 7th case of West Nile virus in an equine in 2021.

WNV transmission occurs when infected mosquitoes feed on animals, as well as humans, after having fed on infected birds.

Clinical signs of WNV in horses include:
- Mild anorexia and depression
- Fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation;
- Hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- Changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- Occasional drowsiness;
- Propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control);
- Spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
- Asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia.

West Nile virus has no cure; however, some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40%. The American Association of Equine Practitioners includes WNV as one of the core diseases all horses should be vaccinated against at least annually.

[A vaccine is available for horses. The WNV vaccine is often combined with eastern (EEE) and western equine encephalitis (WEE), and tetanus. One vaccine to help prevent potentially deadly consequences for your horses is something every horse owner should be vaccinating with. Please consult your veterinarian regarding getting your horse vaccinated. Also please remember to use mosquito/fly spray approved for use on horses. Some components of sprays not specifically approved for horses can cause serious problems.

Please pay attention when a health department has a news release regarding mosquito trapping or birds with WNV or EEE. These are early warning signs to vaccinate your horses.

Remember to empty any standing water from old tires, potted plants, catch basins, or other locations that can hold even a small amount of water. These are perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

Unfortunately, until affected locations receive a killing or hard frost, the mosquitoes carrying these viruses will continue to cause problems in our equine friends. - Mod.TG
