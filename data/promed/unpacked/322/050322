In some of the drier parts of inland Australia (quite removed by distance from Bairnesdale in Victoria), there is a wild legume (_Indigofera_ spp.) containing the toxin indospicine. This plant tends to be more abundant during the wetter seasons in the desert country and/or is a more preferred food of some herbivores at these times.

This toxin can accumulate in the offal and musculature of monogastric herbivores (e.g., horses). If said meat from such animals finds its way into pet food and forms a substantial proportion of the pets' diet, it causes a non-responsive acute hepatitis.

Indospicine in the diet of equines also causes chronic liver disease and a hepatic encephalopathy condition commonly referred to as "walk-about" disease (not to be confused with the condition of similar cause arising from consumption of hepatotoxic _Crotolaria_ spp. by horses in the wetter tropics and sub-tropics). Affected horses compulsively pace or walk, initially causing dumping of the toes of the hooves (especially rear) and progressive loss of coordination with progression to head pressing and, ultimately, death. Feral horses (of which there are sizeable numbers scattered over the drier inland areas of Australia) and domesticated horses showing early signs of walk-about disease are more likely to find their way to knackeries.

This condition was researched and established in Alice Springs by Dept of Primary Industries and Fisheries and a local private veterinary clinic (in collaboration with CSIRO, Long Pocket Research Station in Brisbane, Qld.) in the early-mid 1980s after a run of very good seasons in the central Australian deserts, and seasonal occurrence of acute, non-responsive, fatal hepatitis affecting pet dogs.

"Abstract
Indospicine is a natural toxin occurring only in _Indigofera_ plant species, including the Australian native species _I. linnaei_. These perennial legumes are resistant to drought and palatable to grazing livestock including cattle. Indospicine accumulates in the tissues (including muscle) of animals grazing _Indigofera_, and these residues persist for several months after exposure. Dogs are particularly sensitive to indospicine with reports in past decades of hepatotoxicosis and mortalities in dogs after dietary exposure to indospicine-contaminated horse and camel meat.

"The risk for human consumption is not known, and the current study was undertaken to assess indospicine levels in cattle going to slaughter from divergent regions of Western Australia, and to predict the likelihood of significant residues being present. Muscle and corresponding liver samples from 776 cattle originating from the Kimberley and Pilbara regions in the tropical north of the state, where _I. linnaei_ is prevalent, and 640 cattle from the South West and South Coast regions in the temperate southwest of the state, where the plant is not known to occur, were collected at abattoirs over 4 seasons in 2015-2017. Indospicine levels were measured by LC-MS/MS and ranged from below detection to 3.63 mg/kg. No indospicine residues were detected in any of the animals originating from the South West and South Coast regions. Prevalence of indospicine residues in cattle from the Kimberley region was as high as 33% in spring and 91% in autumn, with positive animals being present in most consignments and on most properties. The average prevalence of indospicine residues from the Kimberley and Pilbara regions throughout the survey period was 63%.

"Risk best-fit probability distributions showed 95th percentile (P95) indospicine concentrations of 0.54 mg/kg for muscle and 0.77 mg/kg for liver in cattle originating from the Kimberley and Pilbara regions during the survey period. When considered with average Australian meat consumption data, the estimated consumer exposure from this P95 muscle was 0.32 micrograms indospicine/kg bw/day, which compared favourably with our calculated provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI) of 1.3 micrograms indospicine/kg bw/day. However canine exposure is of potential concern, with active working dog exposure calculated to exceed this PTDI by a factor of 25, based on a P95 indospicine concentration of 0.54 mg/kg in muscle."

ProMED thanks Dr. Thomson for pointing out that indospicine is certainly a likely explanation of the situation. Likewise, it seems probable that some of the wild animals (kangaroo, for example) may have similar affects from this plant. Some pet food companies use kangaroo and other wild animals in their source meat. The previous posting did not confirm which type of animal(s) meat was used in the processing of the food under investigation. - Mod.TG
