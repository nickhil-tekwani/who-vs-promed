--------------------------------------------------------
SANTOS: The Regional Directorate of Health (DIR-19) confirmed on Mon 20 May
2002 the first case of dengue virus type 3 in Santos, Sao Paulo state. This
type of dengue is considered more dangerous because it easily develops into
hemorrhagic dengue.

Thailand: increased DHF in Nakhon Ratchasima Province
-----------------------------------------------------
Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in the north eastern province of Nakhon
Ratchasima is spreading. Dr Samrerng Yaengkrathok, the Nakhon Ratchasima
Public Health Office chief, said [that] since the middle of last year 823
people from all districts of this province [had contracted] DHF and 6 had
died. This year's number of patients was thrice that of last year,
especially during the second half of the year, and among children aged 10
to 14 years.
Dr Samrerng said Dan Khun Thod district had the largest number of patients
(139), followed by Muang, Phimai, Pak Chong, and Kham Thale So districts.

Australia: dengue virus type 4 detected for first time in North Queensland
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Far Northerners are being urged to be even more vigilant against the threat
of mosquitoes after an outbreak of a second strain [serotype] of dengue
fever this week. Tropical Public Health Unit medical entomologist Scott
Ritchie said a young woman at Smithfield, just north of Cairns, contracted
[dengue virus type 4] infection; the first time that this strain [serotype]
had been detected in North Queensland. This incident follows an outbreak of
[dengue virus type 2] in Kuranda early in April when 18 people were infected.
Dr Ritchie said that: "There are four different types of dengue virus and
[although they are] closely related, if [a person is infected by] one type
of dengue virus, [and subsequently is infected by] another type, [the
second episode may be more serious than the first]. From 1997 to 1999,
almost 500 Far Northerners contracted [dengue virus type 3] and in
Townsville last month there was a small outbreak of [dengue virus type 1]
infection.
Dr Ritchie stated that the Smithfield woman contracted dengue from an
acquaintance who had visited South East Asia. She was not admitted to
hospital, although in serious cases dengue fever can be fatal. Dr Ritchie
said the unit's Dengue Action and Response Team had inspected and treated
areas at Smithfield and Kewarra Beach, where the infected woman spent some
time. "They have conducted spraying inside houses with a synthetic
pyrethrin insecticide and they checked the yards for breeding sites and
treated these," he said. "That's the only case we know of right now (but)
one case can lead to many and there's still a chance there can be other
cases we don't know about." Dr Ritchie urged people to clean up breeding
sites around their homes. "We're trying to keep dengue from developing to
[an] explosive epidemic, which is what happened in Townsville in 1992 and
to some extent what happened in Cairns in 1998," he said. "This mosquito
likes to go into houses -- it's like a cockroach mosquito. "It's the
mosquito that bites you on the ankles in the house."
