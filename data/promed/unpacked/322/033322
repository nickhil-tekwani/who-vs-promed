Virus claims soldier: Infection came from Afghanistan tick bite
---------------------------------------------------------------
A United States Army soldier from Covington County, Alabama, died
Wednesday [16 Sep 2009] in Landstuhl, Germany, after succumbing to a
virus he contracted from a tick [bite] while serving in Afghanistan.

The 22-year-old sergeant from River Falls, Alabama, was stationed
close to Afghanistan's capital of Kabul when the tick bit him, said a
relative in Andalusia. "As far as we know, he was bitten by a tick
that carried a virus," said his relative, who has been in contact with
the soldier's family in Germany. "It put him into a coma for 5 days
and they had him on a dialysis machine. He had a heart attack and
passed away Wednesday morning [16 Sep 2009] at (approximately 8:30
p.m. Tuesday night, Alabama time)."

His relative said doctors determined the soldier contracted the rare
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus, which has been recorded
in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. According to the World Health
Organization's (WHO) Factfile, the mortality rate for the CCHF virus
is 30 percent [see
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/index.html>
and comment below. - Mod.CP]

The soldier's relative said that he may have been the 1st U.S. soldier
to contract the virus in Afghanistan. "We have heard that he was going
out into the countryside with some goat herdsmen, and he picked it up
there."

The virus has a 3-week incubation period, and then once it comes out
of incubation, it starts to attack. [According to the WHO Web site:
Following infection via tick bite, the incubation period is usually
one to 3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. The incubation period
following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually 5 to 6
days, with a documented maximum of 13 days. - Mod.CP]. The soldier
started hemorrhaging on Sunday [13 Sep 2009], and the doctors gave him
2 units of packed red-blood cells and platelets.

"Tuesday, they gave him another dose of platelets, and administered a
feeding tube. By that point, we were told his [probability of
survival] had dropped from 50 percent to 5 percent. I was talking to
his sister (on Wed 16 Sep 2009) and the doctors were going to take him
for a CAT scan, but the heart attack hit before they could do that."

The deceased soldier 1st enlisted in the U.S. Army more than 4 years
ago in Montgomery. He was assigned to Fort Lewis in Pierce County,
Washington, and became a member of the 5th Stryker Brigade Combat
Team, 2nd Infantry Division, which was sent to Afghanistan in July
[2009]. He had recently re-enlisted with the U.S. Army for 6 more
years, and his late father had also served in the military. "He had
come home for a visit in August," his relative said. "The military was
his life. The only thing he wanted to do was go into service. He was
very honored to serve his country."

The relative said funeral arrangements have not been finalized, and
the immediate family is still in Germany. The body will undergo an
autopsy in Atlanta, Georgia, prior to a funeral.

[The geographical distribution of CCHF, like that of its tick vector,
is widespread. Evidence of CCHF virus has been found in Africa, Asia,
the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Health care workers in endemic
areas should be aware of the illness and the correct infection control
procedures to protect themselves and their patients from the risk of
nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infection. Humans who become infected
with CCHF acquire the virus from direct contact with blood or other
infected tissues from livestock during this time, or they may become
infected from a tick bite. The majority of cases have occurred in
those involved with the livestock industry, such as agricultural
workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.

According to the WHO Web site, general supportive therapy is the
mainstay of patient management in CCHF. Intensive monitoring to guide
volume and blood component replacement is required. The antiviral drug
ribavirin has been used in treatment of established CCHF infection
with apparent benefit. Both oral and intravenous formulations seem to
be effective. The value of immune plasma from recovered patients for
therapeutic purposes has not been demonstrated, although it has been
employed on several occasions. No vaccine is currently available, but
as this incident indicates there is an urgent need for development of
a prophylactic vaccine. - Mod.CP]

[CCHF virus infection was originally reported from a 1944 outbreak
affecting 200 Soviet military who were assisting peasants in the
war-devastated Crimean peninsula of the Ukraine. Only about 5000 cases
of CCHF virus infection have been recorded since then in the
literature, and given the relatively small number of people at risk
for contracting the disease, large-scale development and production of
a vaccine to modern regulatory standards seems unlikely. Ref: Ergonul
