Haemorrhagic fever kills more than 100
-----------------------------------
More than 100 people have died in a remote part of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, the result of a suspected haemorrhagic fever
epidemic, local health officials said today.
People began dying of the suspected fever 2 weeks ago near Mweka, an
area in the province of Kasai Occidental, said Jean-Constatin Kanow,
the chief medical inspector for the province. "We began by suspecting
typhoid fever, but now we believe it's haemorrhagic fever," said Kanow.
The DRC has in the past seen large outbreaks of Marburg and Ebola,
both haemorrhagic fevers caused by viruses that in severe cases attack
the central nervous system and cause bleeding from the eyes, ears and
other parts of the body.
The deaths began following the funeral of 2 village chiefs. "Everyone
that attended those funerals is now dead," said the medical inspector.
According to Kanow, haemorrhagic fever is transmitted by contact
with an infected person.
In all, 4 villages are affected and 217 people have come down with the
illness.
Of the 103 recorded deaths, 100 were adults and 3 were children, said Kanow.

The small number of children could be explained by the fact that
children normally take no part in nursing the sick, nor in touching
the bodies of the dead when preparing them for burial, so do not come
into close contact with infectious material. - Mod.JW]
