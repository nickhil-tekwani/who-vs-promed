Two Students Bit By Rabies-Infected Bats
-----------------------------------------
Rabies-infected bats bit 2 [fourth-grade] students in the Goose Creek
Independent School District, prompting the school district to issue a
warning letter to 900 parents. The students at Highlands Elementary found
free tail bats, carried the bats onto the school bus, and played with them.
Other children found and handled another bat 4 days later. A private
company confirmed the bats carried the rabies virus disease after finding
[other] bats in the attic of the elementary school.
School district spokeswoman Kathy Clausen said [that] parents should be
aware of the rabies danger. "Rabies is a fatal disease if a person catches
it," Clausen said. "However, if they have the shots there is no risk at
all. Parents need to be sure whether their children have touched or not
touched a bat. If they have touched it, then they need to get in contact
with us quickly so they can get shots for their children."
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports [that] a bat
bite victim can be bitten and not feel it. Rabies can also transmitted if a
person's broken skin comes into contact with the saliva of a
rabies-infected animal.

Rabid Skunks Found in West Houston
----------------------------------
After 3 rabid skunks have been found near Westheimer and Highway 6 in the
past few weeks, local health officials have reminded residents to ensure
their pets have current rabies immunizations. Animal control officers with
the Houston Department of Health and Human Services (HDHHS) picked up the
skunks after reports of suspicious daytime behavior. Subsequent testing
revealed rabies. These are the first cases of rabies in skunks in Houston
since 1993.
State law and local ordinance require all dogs and cats to be immunized
annually for rabies. In Houston, dogs and cats are also required to be
licensed with the HDHHS Bureau of Animal Regulation and Care (BARC). Rabies
immunization of companion dogs and cats creates a barrier of immunity to
humans from the disease.
HDHHS animal control officers have conducted a door-to-door education
campaign in the affected area and conducted a sweep operation to remove
stray dogs and cats. Anyone observing strange daytime behavior in skunks,
raccoons or bats should call BARC (713-238-9600). An animal control officer
will respond and attempt to remove the animal. Parents should remind
children to avoid wild animals and never to touch a wild animal even though
it may seem tame. Sick animals, such as those with rabies, may appear
docile or they may be aggressive.
Skunks are nocturnal animals and are not normally seen during the day.
Skunks are less active during the cooler winter months and more active when
the weather warms up.
