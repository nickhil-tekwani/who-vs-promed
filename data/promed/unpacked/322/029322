Ross River virus, a painful illness that can persist for years, is
looming as a health threat due to weather conditions that have been
ideal for mosquitoes that transmit the disease.
State health authorities warn it could be a big year for Ross River
virus with 53 cases reported in January and more expected in coming
weeks. There were only 2 cases in January 2005 and 2 in 2004. The
infection rate is now the highest since January 2001 when there were 56 cases.
Hot spots are along the Murray River towns of Mildura and Echuca,
where locals and visitors are advised to wear protective clothing and
apply mosquito repellents, particularly at dusk.
Ross River virus is spread by mosquitoes and can cause arthritis of
the joints as well as rashes.
[A female sufferer] wrote in an email to a support group: "My
symptoms include painful joints, muscle cramping and muscle pain,
painful tendons, tiredness, fatigue and depression."
Other victims complained about symptoms lasting for years. [The same
patient] wrote: "I contracted RRV in '93 after holidaying in
Yarrawonga. I have been suffering from the side effects ever since."
Victoria's health chief, Dr Robert Hall, said there was no vaccine
against Ross River virus and in many people painful symptoms
persisted for years.
"Mosquito breeding is occurring, bites are occurring and transmission
is occurring," Dr Hall said. "Given the kind of weather we've had, I
think this will continue. Preventing mosquito bites is important.
Mosquitoes tend to bite at dusk so people out and about should use
mosquito repellents, long-sleeved clothing and long pants."
He said rain, humidity and heat were favourable conditions for
mosquito breeding.
The Department of Human Services funds rural councils in at-risk
areas to monitor Ross River virus and other diseases and to spray larvae.
Dr Hall confirmed the Victorian Arbovirus Task Force, set up to
advise on control of mosquito-borne diseases, had been disbanded. He
said the department had a "continuing program" of assisting councils
and carried out surveillance.
The warnings of a rise in Ross River infections come 2 years after
Victoria's mosquito management was criticized by a Department of
Sustainability and Environment report, which said partnerships
between the state and councils should be reviewed and strengthened.
During the 20 years of the department's program the Ross River and
Barmah Forest viruses had become endemic, the report noted.
It recommended that helicopters be used in Victoria to spread
larvicides, but Dr Hall questioned the cost and accuracy of
helicopters in smaller breeding areas where ground-based approaches
were preferable.
The department's report also said there had been little research into
the environmental impact of chemical or biological treatments,
particularly on coastal salt marshes, many of which were of national
and international significance.
"Research on the impacts of control materials on fish species for
both freshwater and marine environments is also lacking", the report
said. Furthermore, Victoria lacked a formal approach to residential
and tourist developments along waterways, many of which were breeding
areas for mosquitoes.
