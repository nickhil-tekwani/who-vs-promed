Outbreak location: Pok Fu Lam, Southern District, Hong Kong
Date of start of the outbreak: 18 Mar 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Dogs / - / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: 2 dogs kept in the same household as a confirmed COVID-19 patient. One dog tested positive. Both animals did not show any relevant clinical signs.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: 2 dogs from one household were placed under quarantine on [18 Mar 2020] after their owner was hospitalised due to COVID-19 infection. Following veterinary examination nasal, oral, and rectal swab samples were taken after the dogs' admission to the quarantine facility. Samples from one of the dogs taken on [18 and 19 Mar 2020] tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Both animals did not exhibit any specific clinical signs. Investigations are continuing. Risk management measures are in place for this case, including cleansing and disinfection of the premises, and proper personal hygiene and protection. Mammalian pets from households with confirmed human cases of COVID-19 will be placed under quarantine and veterinary surveillance for 14 days. Samples will be collected for testing of SARS-CoV-2 as appropriate.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening; traceability; quarantine; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory) / Dogs / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 19 Mar 2020 / Positive

[This immediate notification to the OIE by Hong Kong represents the 2nd PCR positive dog to COVID-19. This information was already published in ProMED-mail posting 20200319.7112693. Please refer to comments made by Mod.AS.

The following comes from the OIE's Questions and Answers information on COVID-19 (latest update 23 Mar 2020) available at https://www.oie.int/en/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/

1. Can humans transmit COVID-19 virus to animals?

Now that COVID-19 virus infections cases are widely distributed in the human population there is a possibility for some animals to become infected through close contact with infected humans. To date, 2 dogs known to have tested positive for COVID-19 virus following close contact with infected humans.

Studies are underway to better understand the susceptibility of different animal species to the COVID-19 virus and to assess infection dynamics in susceptible animal species.

Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that animals infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person contact.

2. What do we know about COVID-19 virus and companion animals?

The current spread of COVID-19 is a result of human to human transmission. To date, there is no evidence that companion animals spread the disease. Therefore, there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals which may compromise their welfare.

The Veterinary Services of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China reported to OIE evidence that 2 dogs have been infected with the COVID-19 virus following close exposure to owners who were sick with COVID-19 - see Immediate Notification https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=33455&newlang=en [on 1 Mar 2020] and Follow-up report no.1 https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=33546 [on 9 Mar 2020] and Follow-up report no. 2 https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=33629 [on 16 Mar 2020] and Follow-up report no. 3 https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=33684 [on 23 Mar 2020].

The test, conducted by real time PCR, showed the presence of genetic material from the COVID-19 virus. The dog was not showing any clinical signs of the disease.

There is no evidence that dogs play a role in the spread of this human disease or that they become sick. Further studies are underway to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19 virus. The OIE will continue to provide updates as new information becomes available.

3. What precautionary measures should be taken by owners when companion or other animals have close contact with humans sick or suspected with COVID-19?

There have not been any reports of companion or other animals presenting clinical signs caused by COVID-19 virus infection and currently there is no evidence that they play a significant epidemiological role in this human disease. However, because animals and people can sometimes share diseases (known as zoonotic diseases), it is still recommended that people who are sick with COVID-19 limit contact with companion and other animals until more information is known about the virus.

When handling and caring for animals, basic hygiene measures should always be implemented. This includes hand washing before and after being around or handling animals, their food, or supplies, as well as avoiding kissing, licking or sharing food.

When possible, people who are sick or under medical attention for COVID-19 should avoid close contact with their pets and have another member of their household care for their animals. If they must look after their pet, they should maintain good hygiene practices and wear a face mask if possible.

4. What can National Veterinary Services do with regards to companion animals?

Public Health and Veterinary Services should work together using a One Health approach to share information and conduct a risk assessment when a person with COVID-19 reports being in contact with companion or other animals.

If a decision is made as a result of a risk assessment to test a companion animal which has had close contact with a person/owner infected with COVID-19, it is recommended that RT-PCR be used to test oral, nasal and fecal/rectal samples.

While there is no evidence of a COVID-19 infection spreading from one animal to another, keeping animals that test positive for COVID-19 away from unexposed animals should be considered best practice. - Mod.CRD
