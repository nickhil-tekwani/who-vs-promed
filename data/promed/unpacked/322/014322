West Nile-Like Virus Claims Sixth Victim
-------------------------------------------
A sixth person in the New York City metropolitan region has died
from the West Nile-like virus, health officials said Thursday.
The 76-year-old woman, who lived in Nassau County just east of
the city, died several days ago, said county Health Department
spokeswoman Cynthia Brown.
The mosquito-borne virus so far has infected 54 people in the
metropolitan area, according to the state Department of Health.
In New Jersey, meanwhile, doctors were examining an encephalitis
patient to see if he was suffering from the same strain that killed
the 6 victims.
"At this point there is no evidence that this case here is linked to
that outbreak," said Dr. Elliot Frank of Jersey Shore Medical
Center, where the man was in critical condition. "The only thing
unusual is that we happen to be a state next to a state that's having
an outbreak."
There have been no confirmed cases of West Nile-like virus in New
Jersey [in humans.
The virus - never before recorded in the Western Hemisphere - is
believed to have entered the United States in infected birds.
Hundreds of dead birds have been found in recent weeks from
Connecticut south to New Jersey and Long Island.
