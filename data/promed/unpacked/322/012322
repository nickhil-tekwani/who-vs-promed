A drama ensued in the fokontany [village] of Ambavarano, a commune of Mahavanona in Antsiranana II [Diana region, Antsiranana province] on the day before yesterday [Thu 11 Jan 2018]. After returning from fishing, the villagers divided the meat from 2 sea turtles. Immediately after the meal the 1st symptoms of food poisoning appeared. People could not stop vomiting and were taken to hospital. In spite of intensive care of the ill, 10 people, including a baby of one year, did not survive.

According to the explanations the meat of the sea turtles was unfit for consumption.

Actually 3 people survived after the hospital treatment. Those responsible for this location have put in place a campaign to inform and sensitise the population to stop an incident like this happening.

[It would appear that 13 people were hospitalised, and 10 died.

The following is from a prior ProMED-mail moderator commentary (Mod.LL) from the 2012 incident in Thailand (Foodborne illness, fatal - Thailand: (KR) sea turtle 20121119.1415545):
"Episodes of sea turtle poisoning can be found in the literature. An example of one episode was posted in the Sea Turtle List-serve (http://lists.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0101&L=CTURTLE&P=R14884) by a marine conservation officer in the Solomon Islands:

"28 people (20 children and 8 adults) of Niniveh Village in Marovo Lagoon, western province, Solomon Islands suffered nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, needles and pins, and general weakness after eating turtle meat (which turtle species is yet to be confirmed) on the evening of 16 Jan 2001. The symptoms described occurred 4-6 hours after consumption of turtle meat. The said people consumed only turtle meat (no other protein source consumed). Those who did not consume turtle meat did not experience the symptoms.

"6 people (all children between 3 months-11-years-old) out of the 28 people died within 5 days. Observers reported that the turtle, when caught, was weak; upon being butchered, it was reported to have gut contents smaller than usual; there was a strong smell of urea/urine in the gut, and the meat was unusually softer.

"Other citations include (both from Madagascar):
Yasumoto T: Fish poisoning due to toxins of microalgal origin in the Pacific. Toxicon 1998; 36(11): 1515-18: "From the meat of a turtle, _Chelonia mydas_, implicated in fatal intoxication, lyngbyatoxin A was identified. As turtles feed on sea grass, contaminating blue-green algae belonging to genus _Lyngbya_ were deduced to be the source of the toxin.

"Ranaivoson G, Champetier de Ribes G, Mamy ER, et al: Mass food poisoning after eating sea turtle in the Antalaha district. [Article in French] Arch Inst Pasteur Madagascar. 1994; 61(2): 84-6:

"Abstract
--------
"In December 1994, a mass food poisoning through ingestion of turtle affected about 60 persons on the northeastern coast of Madagascar. The prevailing clinical signs were digestive (nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, acute stomatitis) and might persist during several weeks. The poisoning attack rate was 48 percent with a lethality of 7.7 percent. Such [an] accident, even if rare in Madagascar, requires a structured organization to control sea products poisoning and to set up adequate prevention measures.

"Turtle poisoning (chelonitoxication) appears to be caused by eating the flesh of certain marine turtles (green sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, leatherback turtle). Turtle meat is considered a delicacy in many countries. Hawksbills carry a toxin in their skin called chelonitoxin, which may be accumulated through the food chain as noted above. People who eat the skin and/or meat of the turtle can experience nausea, a burning sensation of the lips tongue and mouth, difficulty in swallowing and a tightness in the chest, skin rash, enlargement of the liver, or even coma and death. - Mod.LL"
