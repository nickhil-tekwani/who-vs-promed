The Department of Health (DOH) on Monday [17 Nov 2008] said a team of
epidemiologists are now probing the alleged outbreak of typhoid fever
in the towns of Real and Infanta, Quezon province, which downed more
than 100 residents there.

DOH-National Epidemiology Center (NEC) director Eric Tayag said a
team of epidemiologists was sent there during the weekend [15-16 Nov
2008] to look into the incident and identify if the illness was
caused by typhoid fever or malaria. Reports said there were already
84 residents downed by the illness in Real town alone as of Monday
[17 Nov 2008].

Tayag said based on the preliminary findings of the DOH-Center for
Health and Development there, the victims displayed symptoms of
typhoid while others also have symptoms of malaria. "We still have to
wait for further updates from the team to declare a typhoid fever
outbreak. The result of the probe is expected to be released until
Friday [21 Nov 2008]," he said.

Tayag said health authorities are expecting the rise in the number of
cases as they haven't figured out the source of contaminated water.
The NEC team reportedly collected drinking water samples to determine
the cause of their illness. Tayag also advised residents of Real and
Infanta towns to boil their water to prevent the spread of the
water-borne disease.

In the last 4 months, 20 people have died and 90 others admitted
following a typhoid outbreak in Kasese district in western Uganda.
The latest deaths were of 4 people, who died last week [week of 3 Nov
2008] in Kyabarungira sub-county. The sub-county chief, Steven Kabau,
said the dead included 2 students of Kuruhe High School, a Primary
Six pupil of Kyabarungira Primary School and a catering graduate.

The district health officer, Dr Peter Mukobi, said: "More people are
believed to have died of typhoid, though their cases have not been reported."

Mukobi said it was difficult to diagnose typhoid. He added, "The
problem with typhoid is that patients show symptoms of malaria at the
beginning. In most cases, by the time one realizes that it is typhoid
it is too late," Mukobi explained.

[Uganda's Kasese district is located in the southwestern part of the
country and can be found on a map at

Both these postings state the difficulty of distinguishing typhoid
fever, a waterborne bacterial disease caused by _Salmonella enterica_
serotype Typhi and malaria, a mosquito-borne protozoan infection
caused a one of several species of _Plasmodium_. Both illnesses, as
well as a number of other infections, present as primarily febrile
episodes without, necessarily, any symptoms suggesting involvement of
a specific organ system.

Typhoid fever is best diagnosed by bacterial culture of the blood or
by serological methods and can be treated with one of a variety of
antibacterial agents. Malaria is best diagnosed by examining a
stained smear of the peripheral blood looking for the
intraerythrocytic protozoa and is treated with one or a combination
of antimalarials. In the absence of laboratory facilities, the
periodic fever of malaria (every 2nd or 3rd day) and the
non-remitting fever of typhoid may help to distinguish the illnesses
although neither may be present early in the illness. - Mod.LL]
