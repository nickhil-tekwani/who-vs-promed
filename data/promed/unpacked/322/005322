Veterinarian Faces Fine for Burning Infected Carcasses
-------------------------------------------------
The veterinarian who discovered the Ames strain of anthrax is being
fined by the State of Texas for burning carcasses infected with
anthrax and other diseases - the only safe method, he says, to get
rid of the health danger.
Public health officials have struggled for decades to dispose of dead
infected animals in a way that protects nearby human populations from
accidental exposure and death. The World Health Organization says the
preferred method is carcass burning, whether in pits, with flame
guns, on the open ground, or in commercial incinerators. High
temperatures, the agency stipulates, are the best way to make sure
that all anthrax spores are destroyed.
But the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission last year
proposed fining the veterinarian, Michael L. Vickers, $9000 for
burning infected carcasses in a pit behind his office, Las Palmas
Veterinary Hospital, on Highway 281 a mile outside Falfurrias, Tex.
On Tuesday, Dr. Vickers was in Austin to fight the fine before an
administrative judge hearing cases of the conservation commission.
The agency, he said in a telephone interview, is more interested in
promoting air quality than in safeguarding against anthrax, a
bacteria with deadly spores that can live for decades underground and
could be collected by terrorists for lethal assaults. In 1981, Dr.
Vickers isolated from a dead cow the strain of anthrax that
eventually came to be known as Ames, the type used in letter attacks
that killed 5 people last fall.
But the commission maintains that Dr. Vickers broke the state law
when he burned the carcasses over the last few years and must pay the
fine. Until this year, veterinarians in Texas were permitted to burn
infected cattle only in commercial incinerators, not open pits. The
law otherwise states that the diseased bodies must go into landfills.
Dr. Vickers argues that infected carcasses in landfills are time
bombs waiting to go off. "Some kid is going to dig it up and die," he
said.
About 20 counties in Texas have had outbreaks of anthrax in animals
in the last few years, with attendant human cases. Last year, a ranch
hand who skinned a buffalo fell ill but survived after 9 days of
hospitalization.
Dr. Vickers won a round when the Texas Legislature passed a measure,
now a law, that says veterinarians in counties with 10 000 residents
or fewer can burn diseased carcasses. That frees him to burn near
Falfurrias, which is in Brooks County near the Rio Grande. But Dr.
Vickers is still on a crusade to free veterinarians in populous
counties, as well. No commercial incinerators are available in Texas
for large-animal veterinarians, he said, and if they existed,
shipping infected carcasses there would entail hauling them long
distances over public roads, creating health dangers. "He does have a
good point," Adria Dawidczik, spokeswoman for the commission, said of
the incineration problems. As for Dr. Vickers's case, Mrs. Dawidczik
said, even though he can legally burn carcasses now, he still has his
earlier violations, which began with a neighbor's complaints.
The two-day hearing in Austin ended yesterday. "We just laid out the
facts," Dr. Vickers said. Bothering a neighbor with occasional smoke,
he added, was a small price for disposing of pathogens that could
endanger the lives of millions of people.
Mrs. Dawidczik said the judge would make his recommendation soon. The
ultimate decision would fall to the full commission, which is
expected to meet on this issue in July.
Martin Hugh-Jones, who helped the World Health Organization draft its
disposal guidelines, said Dr. Vickers was clearly in the right. "We
firmly recommend that animals [be] incinerated. They should be buried
only if they cannot be disposed of in any other way." He added that
diseased animals in landfills were fast becoming a terrorism issue,
as they tended to be near towns and more accessible to malcontents.
"That," he said, "is a real danger."

[Granted there are parts of Texas where it is so dry that burning
carcasses would present a significant risk if it were not done under
supervision. I spoke with Mike Vickers a few weeks ago. He has a pit
with mesquite logs behind his practice/clinic where he has routinely
and safely burnt deer and livestock carcasses. Quite apart from the
obvious biosecurity hazards of delivering such carcasses to a
landfill, which are never close by, it was equally obvious that if a
rancher were asked to take the carcass of his dead deer or cow back
to his ranch 80+ miles away that some (all?) would be dumped off on
the side of the road somewhere.
