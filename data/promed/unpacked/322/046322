News of the response
Social mobilization
-------------------
Fr Oswald Kambale Kibonde, Diocesan Youth Chaplain of Butembo-Beni, invited the sensitizers of the response to Butembo to sensitize young people about the Ebola virus disease. For nearly 30 minutes, around 8000 young people were sensitized through the testimony of a cure and a demonstration of dignified and safe burials with all the didactic material. The coordination of the response decided to increase the awareness actions for young people who are often at the root of resistance because of a lack of knowledge of the disease and its dangers.

[2] WHO: Unmapped chains of transmission in Beni (WHO)
Date: Fri 26 Oct 2018 12:04 PM

Health workers in the Democratic Republic of Congo are struggling to contain a rapidly growing Ebola outbreak in the country's North Kivu and Ituri provinces. The grim outlook in this recent outbreak has been made worse by ongoing civil conflict in the region, as well as a high refugee population which is particularly vulnerable to the disease.

"Security incidents over the past week, ranging from clashes between rebel and government forces resulting in civilian deaths to response vehicles being pelted with stones, continued to cause community distress and severely impede response activities [...]," WHO officials said [Thu 25 Oct 2018]. "These incidents are occurring amidst intense EVD transmission in communities in the city of Beni."

More troubling is the fact that at least 17 of the 27 new EVD cases identified over the past week had no established contact with any other infected individuals. Dr Mike Ryan, assistant director-general of the WHO's emergency preparedness and response program, told STAT News the unmapped chains of transmission pose a particular threat to the containment process.

"There is underground community transmission in Beni. It may not be at a very intense level. But it is enough to continue and drive transmission in this town. And we need to stop it," he said. "We need to pull the roots of this thing out of this city."

[The sharp spike in the number of new confirmed cases over the weekend is a reflection of disrupted control efforts there due to violence and isolated incidents of noncompliance. Most alarmingly, many if not most of the new cases are not prior known contacts, portending a continuing escalation of the outbreak. - Mod.LXL]

[3] Children

Children in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo are dying from Ebola at an unprecedented rate due largely to poor sanitary practices at clinics run by traditional healers, the health ministry said on [Sun 28 Oct 2018].

The impact on children has been felt acutely in the city of Beni, which has emerged as the outbreak's new epicentre. Of 120 confirmed Ebola cases in Beni, at least 30 are under 10-years-old, and 27 of them have died, according to health ministry data.

Many children affected by an unrelated malaria outbreak near Beni are thought to have contracted Ebola at clinics run by traditional healers who have also treated Ebola patients, said Jessica Ilunga, a spokeswoman for the health ministry.

"There is an abnormally high number of children who have contracted and died of Ebola in Beni. Normally, in every Ebola epidemic, children are not as affected," Ilunga told Reuters.

"Traditional healers use the same tools to treat everyone. And the child who has entered a traditional healer's clinic with malaria comes out with Ebola and dies several days later," she said.

[Children have been among the most tragic victims of the current outbreak and unrest, not only as patients, but also as Ebola orphans and abductees. It is not yet clear whether proportionally more children are getting infected during this outbreak compared to the West African epidemic (when nearly 1/5 of those infected were children), but mortality rates are undoubtedly higher in children, particularly infants and toddlers. We posted a discussion on children affected by this year's (2018) earlier Equateur province outbreak (archive 20180606.5841051).
