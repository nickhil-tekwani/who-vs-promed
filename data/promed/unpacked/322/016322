The rains might have brought some respite to the city of Chennai [Tamil Nadu] but the slush that is left behind may harbor mites.

Doctors in Chennai are warning of an infection that spreads from to the bite of mites. These mites cause a disease called scrub typhus that is prevalent during peak monsoon season. The disease, which leaves symptoms similar to other monsoon-related diseases, could prove fatal if not diagnosed and treated on time. Medical experts have been expressing concern over scrub typhus as they have been witnessing a rise in the number of cases at government hospitals.

At the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) alone, there had been 2 or 3 cases every week in the last few months. The disease has symptoms which people often associate with dengue and other viral diseases -- high fever, headaches, rashes, lymph-node enlargement, and body ache.

"People often test for other diseases, but don't think of scrub typhus. Not many know that it is a completely treatable disease. But if left untreated, it could prove fatal," a doctor at the RGGGH said.

These mites, usually found in forest areas in the hills. When they bite, they will leave an eschar or scab on the surface of the skin. This eschar is particularly important for diagnosis, doctors said.

[The following is excerpted from: Demma LJ, McQuiston JH, Nicholson WL, et al. Scrub typhus, Republic of Palau. Emerg Infect Dis. 2006; 12 (2): 290-5; available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf and was part of a moderation by my colleague ML:

"Scrub typhus is a zoonotic illness caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_. The pathogen is transmitted through the bite of larval mites (chiggers) of the _Trombiculidae_ family, which serve as both the vector and the reservoir (1,2). Rodents of the family _Muridae_ (rats and mice) are common hosts for trombiculid mites and may support _O. tsutsugamushi_. Geographically specific foci of scrub typhus are thus determined by the distribution of vector mites and their rodent hosts and by interactions of mites and rodents with humans (3). Scrub typhus has been reported from many regions of Asia and the Pacific islands, and known disease-endemic regions extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan (4,5).

"Scrub typhus is typically a nonspecific febrile illness; its severity may be influenced by the strain of _O. tsutsugamushi_, a person's immune status, and other factors. Diagnosis may be complicated in areas where the disease has not been documented recently or in regions lacking the capacity for laboratory confirmation. Illness develops after an incubation period of 6 to 21 days and usually begins with an eschar at the site of a chigger bite. Fever, headache, [lymphadenopathy], and myalgias are common, and a maculopapular rash may also be present. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or lower respiratory symptoms can also occur. Manifestations such as pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis can develop during the prolonged clinical course of untreated illness (6). Establishing the diagnosis and initiating prompt antimicrobial drug therapy are important, because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent (5). Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline, and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation."

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm). Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Patients with severe scrub typhus can develop multiorgan failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with hemorrhage.
