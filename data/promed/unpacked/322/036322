A 2-year-old horse in Monmouth County was euthanized on 6 Oct 2010
after coming down with eastern equine encephalitis, according to the
New Jersey Department of Agriculture.

The rare and serious mosquito-borne illness causes inflammation of
the brain tissue and has a significantly higher risk of death in
horses than West Nile virus infection, according to the New Jersey
Department of Agriculture (NJDOA).

New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Douglas H. Fisher said in a press
release about the incident that horse owners should contact their
veterinarians to have their animals vaccinated against these illnesses.

"The equine industry plays an important role in this state's economy
and it's important to protect them from diseases spread by
mosquitoes," Fisher said in the press release.

The Monmouth County mare had not been vaccinated against this
disease. Effective equine vaccines for eastern equine encephalitis
and another mosquito-borne disease, West Nile virus, are available.
Horse owners should contact their veterinarians now if their horses
are not up to date on their vaccinations, according to the NJDOA.

West Nile virus is a viral disease that affects horses' neurological
systems. Horses contract the virus when infected mosquitoes bite
them. The diseases cannot be spread from horse to horse or from an
infected horse to humans or domestic pets, according to NJDOA.

While the eastern equine encephalitis case is the 1st of 2010, there
have been 2 reported cases of West Nile virus this year [2010], a
2-year-old mare from Atlantic County and a 22-year-old gelding from
Gloucester County. Both were humanely euthanized, and neither was
vaccinated for the disease, according to the NJDOA.

In 2009, New Jersey had one case of equine West Nile virus, and 6
horses tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis. In 2008,
there were no equine cases of either disease, according to the NJDOA.

Like other viral diseases affecting horses' neurological systems,
these diseases must be reported to the state veterinarian at
609-292-3965 within 48 hours. For more information, visit the NJDOA
website at <http://www.nj.gov/agriculture/

[This article contains a couple of paragraphs about West Nile virus,
but it is important to clarify that these 2 diseases are not really
that similar, and this report is a case of eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE). Although both are mosquito borne zoonotic
diseases, they are very different in their viral etiology,
epidemiology, emerging disease status, zoonotic potential, prevalence
and case fatality rates in humans and in equines. For example, 2010
CDC ArboNET data to date indicate that there have been 789 cases of
West Nile in humans and 33 deaths, for a case fatality rate of 0.041
(See tables at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/surv&controlCaseCount10_detailed.htm>.).
In the case of eastern equine encephalitis, case fatality rates in
humans normally run in the range of 30 percent, and there are only a
handful of human cases each year in the United States (See
<http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/tech/epi.html> and
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/arbor/arb!

ofact.htm>).

New Jersey is one of the most common states for the occurrence of
human cases, as well as Florida, Georgia and Massachusetts. Fresh
water hardwood swampy areas are the most common places where
transmission occurs.

This year [2010] to date, in horses, there have been 217 cases of
eastern equine encephalitis and 77 cases of West Nile virus infection
officially reported. This case is the 1st case reported in New Jersey
this year.

The very last line emphasizes the necessity of reporting eastern
equine encephalitis and West Nile virus to the state veterinarian,
and all accredited veterinarians are required to do so as part of
their role in animal disease surveillance. Since animal health in the
United States is a cooperative state and federal effort, reporting to
the state veterinarian ensures that the USDA Animal Plant Health
Inspection Service Area Veterinarian in Charge for that state will
also get the information.

Again, as other moderators have emphasized, an effective vaccine for
horses is available and essential if horse owners want to avoid
having to euthanize their horses, as happened in this instance. - Mod.PC]
