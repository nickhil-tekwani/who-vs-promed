Bangli, Bali: the mother of 2 H5N1 victims dies
-----------------------------------------------
A woman died in her house, in Jehem village, Tembuku sub-district,
Bangli, Bali. Officials suspected bird flu (H5N1) infection and
collected a sample from the woman. The victim is the mother whose 2
children died of H5N1 in Sanglah hospital several days ago (see "Avian
influenza, human (60): Indonesia (BA) fatal, susp. 20111010.3036").

After that the mother developed fever and was then treated in Bangli
hospital. When she was in hospital, her blood examination tested
negative for H5N1. She left the hospital and died 2 days after. The
victim is being treated as if she was infected by bird flu H5N1, with
officials wearing bio-security clothes. Mourners are obliged to wear
masks.

The Health Service and Livestock Service of Bali province sprayed

H5N1 suspected in death of Indonesian mother
--------------------------------------------
The mother of the 2 Indonesian children from Bali who died recently
from H5N1 avian flu has died at her home after having a fever and
being treated in the hospital, according to a report today [17 Oct
2011] from Bird Flu Information Corner [see item [1] above], a Web
message board operated by Kobe University in Japan and Airlangga
University in Indonesia.

The woman died 2 days after leaving the hospital, where her blood
tests were negative for H5N1 infection. Public health officials
suspect that the woman may have had an H5N1 infection and are taking
precautions, such as having officials wear protective clothing and
requiring mourners to wear masks, according to the report.

It's not clear if the woman had received oseltamivir (Tamiflu)
prophylaxis after H5N1 was confirmed in her children, who died in the
hospital on 9 Oct 2011. Translated reports from the Indonesian media
on the mother's death said she had fled the hospital before she died,
according to FluTrackers, an infectious disease message board that
monitors foreign-language news reports. [The full text, which gives a
more dramatic account of the events leading up to this fatality can be

Family illness clusters raise concerns about possible human-to-human
H5N1 spread, though in this instance cause of the mother's death
hasn't been confirmed, and previous media reports suggested a possible
common exposure to the virus. The children had reportedly handled dead
poultry in their home.

[It remains true that none of these fatalities, the 2 siblings and
their mother, have been confirmed by a WHO-authenticated laboratory to
be a consequence of avian influenza A/H5N1 virus infection. Nor is it
certain that the they were exposed to avian influenza virus infected
poultry. Clarification is awaited. The last confirmed human case of
avian H5N1 influenza virus infection died in Western Java on 25 Aug
2011. - Mod.CP]
