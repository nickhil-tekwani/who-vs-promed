Six districts in 2 provinces have reported an outbreak of the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in livestock, the Ministry of Agriculture announced on Wednesday [11 May 2022].

"The Agriculture Ministry has set 2 areas hit by outbreaks of the foot-and-mouth disease in animals; the areas are 2 districts in Aceh province and 4 districts in East Java," Agriculture Minister Syahrul Yasin Limpo informed at a press conference here [Jakarta].

The 2 districts hit by the FMD outbreak in Aceh are Aceh Tamiang and East Aceh, while the 4 districts in East Java are Gresik, Sidoarjo, Lamongan, and Mojokerto, Limpo said.

According to the ministry's data, 3205 heads of livestock have been infected with FMD in East Java, with the death rate reaching 1.5%. Meanwhile, 2226 heads of livestock have contracted FMD in Aceh, with one death recorded so far.

FMD affects cloven-hoofed animals such as cows, goats, sheep, and pigs, Limpo said. The disease is transmitted through air or direct contact.

The FMD in livestock is not transmitted to humans, but only to other farm animals, the minister emphasized.

The ministry, along with the provincial, district, and city-level local governments, has established a task force for controlling FMD transmission, he added.

Limpo explained that the government has taken 3 anticipatory measures to tackle the outbreak: 1st, emergency measures involving direct intervention through outbreak localization to keep the disease from spreading further, and distribution of medicines, vitamins, antibiotics, and preparation of vaccines.

The 2nd step has involved controlling the outbreak so that it does not spread and the virus does not mutate. The 3rd step has involved implementing recovery efforts for livestock.

[According to the above information, a 6th district, East Aceh, has been added to the 5 districts included in Indonesia's immediate notification to the OIE, dated 9 May 2022. OIE's notification, including a map presenting the 2 affected areas, one located within Aceh province (north-west) and the other in East Jawa province (south-east), is accessible at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=53545.

The distance between the 2 affected areas is about 2100 km (about 1300 mi); it is yet to be checked if both are caused by a similar virus strain.

Serotyping and genotyping results, anticipated soon, are expected to allow vaccine selection. - Mod.AS
