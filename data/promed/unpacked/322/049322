1st Report of Zucchini yellow mosaic virus in Cucumber (_Cucumis
sativus_) in India.
Raj Verma, Satya Prakash, and S. P. S. Tomer, Indian Agricultural
Research Institute, Regional Station, Agricultural College Estate,
P.O. Shivajinagar, Pune-411 005, India. Plant Dis. 88:906, 2004;
published on-line as D-2004-0602-01N, 2004. Accepted for publication
17 Feb 2004.
In August of 2002, cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_ L. cv. Himangi) plants
grown in commercial fields in Pune, western Maharashtra, India,
exhibited chlorotic spots, veinal chlorosis, mosaic, blister
formation and shoestring symptoms on leaves, stunted growth, and
distortion of fruits. Incidence of virus infection in the fields
varied from 25-38 percent.
Crude sap extracted from infected cucumber leaf samples was
inoculated mechanically onto cucumber and indicator host plants. The
inoculated glasshouse-grown cucumber plants showed virus symptoms
similar to those observed in the field. The virus produced chlorotic
local lesions on _Chenopodium amaranticolor_ and chlorotic spots
followed by veinal chlorosis, mosaic, vein banding, and leaf
distortion on _Citrullus lanatus_, _C. melo_, _C. sativus_,
_Cucurbita maxima_, _Cucurbita pepo_, _Luffa acutangula_, and
_Trichosanthes anguina_. The virus did not infect _Nicotiana
benthamiana_, _N. glutinosa_, or _N. tabacum_ cv. White Burley (1,2).
Cucumber and indicator plants were tested using direct antigen
coating enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. A positive reaction was
obtained with monoclonal antiserum to Zucchini yellow mosaic virus
(ZYMV) but not with antisera to Papaya ringspot virus-P, Cucumber
mosaic virus, or Watermelon mosaic virus (Agdia, Inc., Elkhart, IN).
The disease was observed again in the field during July to September
2003. Natural infection of zucchini (_Cucurbita pepo_) by ZYMV has
been reported previously from India (3). To our knowledge, this is
the 1st report of ZYMV in cucumber in India.

[Zucchini yellow potymosaic virus (ZYMV), recognized in 1981, has
spread from its origins in Italy and France to 22 countries on 5
continents. Originally named muskmelon yellow stunt virus, later
changed to ZYMV, it often causes devastating epidemics. The disease
is extremely difficult to control with insecticides, reflective
mulches, and mineral oils. Better results can be obtained with
resistant cultivars.
Resistance is present in some lines of _Cucumis sativus_ from China
and in an accession of _C. melo_ from India. Unfortunately, this
resistance is strain-specific and thus not effective against a 2nd
pathotype. Resistance is available in a wild squash (_Cucurbita
ecuadorensis_) and in a _C. moschata_ line from Nigeria.
All tested commercial cultivars of _Citrullus lanatus_ (watermelon)
are susceptible, but resistance is available in some accessions of
_C. colocynthis_ from Nigeria. A very high level of resistance was
found in some races of _C. lanatus_ from Zimbabwe, but it confers
resistance to the Florida strain only.
In recent years, new squash lines possessing the coat protein gene of
this virus have been developed and proved to be resistant under field
conditions. The ZYMV coat protein gene has also been incorporated
into melon and cucumber.
