State officials confirmed a case of anthrax in livestock for the 1st time in 25 years. The Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory confirmed the case among cattle in Jackson County in southwest Oklahoma last week. Officials said the affected area is under quarantine, and the exposed herd will be vaccinated for anthrax to prevent further spread. They said the food supply is not affected.

"We have been working closely with our state partners concerning any risk to human health," said Morgan Vance, spokesperson for the state Agriculture, Food and Forestry Department told The Oklahoman. "Anthrax in livestock occurs sporadically when the weather and soil conditions are conducive for its spread. Anthrax in livestock is not new to Oklahoma, and the last known confirmation occurred in 1996 in Payne County."

Officials confirmed a cow carcass has been incinerated to keep other animals from being exposed.

Vance said Texas also is experiencing cases of anthrax in livestock in Hardeman County, just across the border from Oklahoma's Jackson County [see Anthrax - USA (03): (TX) cattle 20210812.8587976].

Researchers at Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service say many common species are susceptible to anthrax. These include sheep, goats, horses, cattle, swine, and domestic or exotic deer. Cats and dogs also are susceptible, though researchers say those cases are rare.

Anthrax can be found naturally in soil, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Animals can become infected when they ingest spores in contaminated soil, plants, or water. Anthrax spores can remain dormant for years. Researchers say anthrax outbreaks are spurred by mild, but wet, winters and springs followed by dry spells and intense summer drought.

[My fellow moderator Mod.TG in Texas informed me of the recent outbreak in Armstrong County involving cattle, deer, and horses (plural). But Texas only confirmed in a single horse [see Anthrax - USA (04): (TX) horse 20210825.8621792]. Taken together with this recent Oklahoman outbreak, there is clearly a much wider series of animal cases in this Texas-Oklahoma border region, almost certainly including deer.

As this outbreak breaks a 25-year absence of reported cases in Oklahoma, we can presume that our OK veterinary service officers are out on their ranches asking who might have seen what and where and when. And watch the turkey vultures. They cluster where there are carcasses, both on the ground when feeding and in the air above. Tell-tale behavior.

To find Jackson County in Oklahoma, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_County,_Oklahoma. It is close to Hardeman and Armstrong counties in close-by Texas. As usual, many thanks to Mahmoud. - Mod.MHJ
