Across Gauteng, a total of 236 cases of African horse sickness (AHS) have been reported between 1 Jan and 18 Jun 2019, according to the Gauteng Department of Agriculture and Rural Development -- and the illness has also hit closer to home.

The historic and internationally recognised horses of the South African Lipizzaners non-profit organisation (NPO), located in Kyalami, have been affected by the virus. So far, 4 Lipizzaners have died and one has managed to survive with treatment.

The NPO is appealing to the public for donations so they can buy medication and insect repellent needed to prevent further deaths at both the venue in Kyalami and at the organisation's stud farm, where females and foals are kept.

"We've lost young and old horses so far," explained Dr. Karen Bohme, who is the head rider and veterinarian for the South African Lipizzaners. "We lost 2 brood mares. We also lost 2 colts within a day of each other in late April [2019]," she added.

AHS is [caused by] a virus that appears seasonally in warmer weather and is transferred by biting midges, according to a statement by Steve Galane of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, which receives official reports of the disease. Galane added that AHS was particularly present in the country this year [2019] due to climatic factors such as rainfall and temperature.

"In most of South Africa, except for a part of the Western Cape province, AHS is endemic and the area is known as an AHS-infected zone. Unfortunately, outbreaks of AHS are expected to occur in the AHS-infected zone from November to May, often with a peak from February to April," the statement read in part.

Symptoms from the illness include a raised temperature, bulged eyes, a high heart rate and purple gums. With a mortality rate between 50% and 95%, horses who succumb to the illness are killed by heart failure.

According to Bohme, a 3rd female Lipizzaner also contracted the disease, but managed to survive and was on heart medication for about 6 weeks. The South African Lipizzaners centre is appealing to the public for donations to pay for preventative care and treatment. Lipizzaners have been in South Africa for over 70 years since a number of them were brought over to escape the Second World War in Europe.

To prevent the spread of the illness, the animals need to be doused in insect repellent, which the organisation had not budgeted for. "Our horses have all been vaccinated [against AHS], as that was budgeted for and is actually the law, but the cost of insect repellent was not expected and that's what we are fundraising for now," Bohme said.

The insect repellent is used to stop midges from biting the animals and thus infecting them, and the 68 Lipizzaners at the organisation need to be doused with about one litre of the substance each month for protection until the 1st winter frosts appear. Other preventative measures, such as keeping the horses stabled overnight to keep them away from insects, have been implemented.

"We're aiming to raise USD 12 000, and we've raised about USD 1440 so far," Tessa Hellman, who also works at the NPO, said. She added that the website they use to raise funds operates in American currency.

Protecting the animals should be important to everyone, Bohme added. "The South African Lipizzaners are unique. They have been here at this premises in Kyalami for 60 years, and here in South Africa for 70 years, so they are part of our cultural heritage. It would be very sad if we lost them."

To make a donation to the animals' medical care and treatment, visit <www.chuffed.org/project/lipizzaner-urgent-medical-rescue>. Donations are welcome until the end of June [2019], and the threat imposed by African horse sickness should abate for this year with the 1st frosts of winter.

[AHS, a severe arbovirus infection of horses and other equids, causing up to 95% case fatality rates in susceptible horses, is endemic in South Africa. The disease is caused by one or more of the 9 known serotypes; it has a strong seasonality, with most cases occurring from late spring (October) through to autumn (April), associated with the period of greatest vector activity and abundance. Cases are also distributed geographically and temporally such that outbreaks start 1st in the northeast of the country each year and progress to the south and west as the _Culicoides_ vector season progresses.

For export purposes, South Africa has established, in the southwest area around Cape Town and the Cape of Good Hope, a self-declared AHS-control area and a free zone, applicable with importing countries on the basis of bilateral agreements.

Midrand is an area in central Gauteng Province and is part of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality (map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrand). Climate is warm-temperate, winter dry; AHS is endemic; the current cases seem out of season or, at least, belated.

The majority of the famous Lipizzaner horses, a breed which dates back to the 16th century, are registered through the member organizations of the Lipizzan International Federation, which covers almost 11 000 horses in 19 countries. The largest number are in Europe, followed by the Americas, then Africa and Australia.

It is disappointing to note that the 4 Lipizzaners died of AHS in spite of reported vaccination. The freeze-dried, polyvalent, live attenuated AHS vaccine, produced for decades in Onderstepoort, is known to render satisfactory prophylactic immunisation if stored and applied according to the producer's detailed recommendations (available at https://www.obpvaccines.co.za/Cms_Data/Contents/OBPDB/Folders/Product/~contents/4AR2ZW46HZAJAFDB/2063_AHS_PI.pdf).

Because it takes up to 2 to 3 vaccinations for horses to become immune to all the serotypes in the vaccine, it is important to combine vaccination with the control of the _Culicoides_ midges, which transmit the disease. Horses can be protected from midge bites by stabling them from dusk to dawn, using insect repellents and keeping animals away from low-lying vlei (wetland) areas or other surface water during the day.

It will be helpful to obtain lab confirmation of the 4 cases, including the strain's serotype, as well as the vaccination history of the affected Lipizzaner horses. - Mod.AS
