-------------------------------------------------------------
The article mentions 2 cases of rabid black bears on the east coast of the United States: the recent Virginia bear and one in Maryland in 2007. Another black bear was diagnosed with rabies in Centre County, Pennsylvania in 2004. This bear was found dead and when a full necropsy was performed, it was discovered that the sow had devoured her cubs. The rabid Pennsylvania black bear had no known contact with humans or domesticated animals.
