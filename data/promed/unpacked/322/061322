A strange disease has killed 2 Ugandan peacekeepers in Somalia and
affected 17 others who were flown to a hospital in Nairobi yesterday
[28 Jul 2009], according to the UPDF [Uganda People's Defense Force].

One died in Mogadishu on Tuesday [28 Jul 2009] evening while another
one died on Wednesday [29 Jul 2009] morning in Nairobi, said
spokesperson Col Felix Kulayigye. Another 17 are admitted at the
intensive care unit of Nairobi Hospital.

UPDF has dispatched a medical team to Mogadishu to establish the
cause of the problem.

"The symptoms are chest pain, fever, headache, swelling of the lower
limbs, rapid heart-beat, and difficulties in breathing," said Kulayigye.

"We have no confirmation yet on what disease they are suffering
from." By the end of last week [25 Jul 2009], over 50 Burundians had
been hit by the same mysterious disease, killing 4. Dr Col James
Kiyengo, the force medical officer, on Friday [24 Jul 2009] said they
suspected the disease to be leptospirosis.

"Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease caused by exposure to water
contaminated with the urine of infected animals," Dr Kiyengo
explained. "For example, a rat could have urinated in a water tanker
and spread the disease."

Al Shabaab, the Islamist insurgents fighting the Somali government
and the peacekeepers, claimed responsibility, saying they had
poisoned them. But the claim was dismissed by medical officers of the
African Union peacekeeping force, who said it was a bacterial
infection as a result of poor hygiene and living conditions
associated with the job.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control [and Prevention -
CDC], leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals.

In humans it causes a wide range of symptoms, such as high fever,
severe headache, chills, muscle aches, and vomiting. It may include
jaundice (yellow skin), red eyes, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, or a
rash. If not treated, the patient could develop kidney damage,
meningitis (inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal
cord), liver failure, and respiratory distress. In rare cases death occurs.

Humans become infected through contact with water, food, or soil
containing urine from infected animals, such as dogs or rats,
according to the US Centers for Disease Control. This may happen by
swallowing contaminated food or water, through skin contact, such as
the eyes or nose, or contact with broken skin.

The disease is not known to be spread from person to person. The time
between a person's exposure to a contaminated source and becoming
sick is about 4 weeks.

The illness lasts from a few days to 3 weeks. Without treatment,
recovery may take several months. Leptospirosis is an occupational
hazard for many people who work outdoors or with animals, such as
farmers, veterinarians, fishermen, or the military.

Dr Kiyengo said the disease can be treated with antibiotics and
prevented by boiling water and keeping out rats.

There are 4300 AU [African Union] peacekeepers in Somalia, of whom
2700 are Ugandan. The current Ugandan contingent will be replaced
next month [August 2009]. Col Nathan Mugisha is taking over from Gen
Francis Okello as force commander.

[Leptospirosis has a variable clinical picture, and can be
complicated by heart and kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure,
and respiratory distress. The news release above mentions that
patients in the outbreak had chest pain, fever, headache, swelling of
the lower limbs, rapid heartbeat, and difficulties in breathing, but
these findings are too non-specific to lead to a diagnosis. In
addition, no mention is made in the news release of myalgias or
conjunctival suffusion, predominant presenting findings of
leptospirosis; neither is jaundice, a prominent finding of severe
leptospirosis, mentioned. - Mod.ML]

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic water-related disease caused by
pathogenic _Leptospira_ species. The organisms have been found in
rodents, insectivores, dogs, cattle, pigs, and horses. Hence it is an
occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals,
such as military personnel, farmers, sewer workers, veterinarians,
and dairy workers. Human infection occurs through direct contact with
the urine of infected animals or by contact with a urine-contaminated
environment, such as surface water, soil, and plants. The bacteria
gain entry through cuts and abrasions in the skin and through mucous
membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Disease symptoms include high
fever, severe headache, muscle pain, chills, and redness in the eyes,
abdominal pain, jaundice, hemorrhages in skin and mucous membranes
(including pulmonary bleeding), vomiting, diarrhoea, and a rash (see
<http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/leptospirosis/en/index.html>).

In a suspected outbreak, attempts to diagnose leptospirosis must be
encouraged to enable prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics.
When an outbreak of leptospirosis is suspected or identified, and if
it has been possible to identify the serovar concerned, the source
must be identified and appropriate environmental measures
implemented, with public information to people at risk (including
clinicians and health care workers and health authorities; (see
<http://www.who.int/zoonoses/diseases/Leptospirosissurveillance.pdf>).
