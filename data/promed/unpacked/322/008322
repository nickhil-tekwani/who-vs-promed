There are at least 150 persons affected - intoxicated - presumably by some kind of bacteria present in the water supply delivered to Antigua population [Los Antiguos, Santa Cruz Province].

Sources from the community consulted by Diario Nuevo Dia (a local newspaper) reported that classes in schools have been suspended, and that the hospital has become completely full ('collapsed') with affected persons.

Meanwhile, the local Municipality held a press conference led by Mr. Marcelo Arias, the Government Secretary, who gave explanations about the current situation.

On the other hand, the Head of the local hospital, Dr. Peralta, also gave explanations and he explained that if more affected persons are admitted to the local hospital, they will be referred to the Perito Moreno Hospital, because of the collapse of the local hospital.

"Many adults and children from our community have been affected by an unknown bacterium present in the water" said a concerned neighbor consulted by the Diario Nuevo Dia.

[This article has very little usable information in it. It does not tell us what clinical signs there are. It suggests this is an acute situation, and has overwhelmed the hospital. It does not tell us if the city is working on a correction or if this a broken pipe or a reservoir contamination. ProMED would appreciate any additional details on this incident including clinical signs, agent(s) involved, etc. - Mod.TG
