Molecular Epidmiology of West Nile Virus in Connecticut in 1999/2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The 1999 outbreak of West Nile (WN) virus in the northeastern United
States was the first known natural occurrence of this flavivirus in
the Western Hemisphere. In 1999 and 2000, 82 independent Connecticut
WN virus isolates were cultured from 9 species of birds, 5 species of
mosquitoes, and one striped skunk. Nucleotide sequences obtained from
these isolates identified 30 genetic changes compared with WN-NY99, in
a 921-nucleotide region of the viral genome beginning at nucleotide
position 205 and ending at 1125. This region encodes portions of the
nucleocapsid and envelope proteins and includes the entire coding
regions for the pre-membrane and membrane proteins.
Amino acid changes occurred at 7 loci in 6 isolates relative to the
WN-NY99 strain. Although 34 of the isolates showed sequences identical
to the WN-NY99 isolate, we were able to show geographical-based
clusters of mutations. In particular, 26 isolates were characterized
by mutation of C to T at position 858. This group apparently
originated in Stamford, CT and disseminated to sites located as far as
54 miles from Stamford.
Sequences of WN virus isolated from both brain and heart tissues from
the same avian host were identical in all 14 tested individual birds,
suggesting that the mutations we have documented are real and not
caused by culture, RNA extraction, or PCR procedures. We conclude that
this portion of the viral genome will enable us to follow the
geographical and temporal movement of variant WN virus strains as they
adapt to North America.

epidemiology of West Nile virus, which will have value in tracking the
precise routes of spread of the virus and determining the course of
its evolution to conditions in the Western Hemisphere. The full
