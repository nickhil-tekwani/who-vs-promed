[Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is endemic in north eastern India, including Bihar state, and cases occur there annually. Although there have been fewer cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and JE in Bihar state this year (2021) than in previous years, these 2 cases indicate that Japanese encephalitis virus continues to be transmitted in that state.

The widespread immunization program in 35 of the 38 districts reported earlier doubtless has played a role in JE case reduction (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) 20210910.8658538).

Making JE a reportable disease would help with accurate surveillance because JE cases are admitted to a variety of private and public hospitals in the state. - Mod.TY
