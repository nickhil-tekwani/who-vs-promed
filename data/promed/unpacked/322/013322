Tasmanian health authorities have warned of the dangers of Ross River virus
after nine cases [were detected] so far this year - the same as for the
whole of 1998. The new cases have been reported in south-east Tasmania,
mainly in the Sorell municipality.
The increased rainfall this summer is likely to have led to an increase in
mosquitoes. Public and Environmental Health director Mark Jacobs last night
said Ross River virus was transmitted via mosquito bites. Outbreaks usually
peaked in mid to late summer or early autumn. "It is quite likely we will
have more cases and sometimes they continue through May," Dr Jacob said.
Ross River virus can cause a wide range of symptoms including headaches,
muscle and joint pains, rashes and fever. "In most cases symptoms can last
for one to two weeks, although in a small number of cases they can exist
for a few months," Dr Jacob said. "Infected people recover completely and
develop life-long immunity to further infection."

[Persistent polyarthralgias have been recorded. There is no reason to
believe this disease is brief, mild, and uneventful. I believe Danny
McColl has retired but we would appreciate it if another reader in
Launceston, or elsewhere in Tasmania, a.k.a. "the South Island", would keep
us apprised of this situation. - Mod.CHC]
