Since March 2018, the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health has reported an increase in the number of confirmed cases of acute hepatitis A virus. This increase in cases has primarily been among injecting and non-injecting drug users, homeless or mobile individuals, and those who have been recently incarcerated. Viral sequencing has linked cases from Kentucky and California.

Tennessee's growing hepatitis A outbreak has caused its 1st death, state officials announced [on Wed 14 Nov 2018]. Elizabeth Hart, a spokeswoman for Tennessee Department of Health, said the fatality occurred in East Tennessee but that she could not release any other information about the death.

The hepatitis A outbreak has now spread to 449 cases statewide, including 134 cases in Nashville and another 201 in the surrounding 12 counties. Another 40 cases have been documented in Chattanooga, which is the state's 2nd most impacted city, according to state data. Local officials have listed the Nashville count as even higher -- 146 cases as of [Fri 9 Nov 2018].

"We are very saddened by the recent death associated with hepatitis A and realize unfortunately, we could see more deaths, as this continues to be a very serious outbreak with more than half of the people identified with the illness needing hospitalization," said Dr John Dreyzehner, Tennessee's health commissioner. "We will continue to respond aggressively, vaccinating high risk populations, educating and working with partners in and out of Tennessee to seek additional ways to stem this outbreak."

Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by a virus that causes fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, and a yellowing of the eyes and skin known as jaundice. The infection is most commonly spread through contaminated food and water or close contact with an infected person, particularly anal intercourse. Vaccines have been standard for children for about a decade, but many adults were never immunized.

William Schaffner, a renowned infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told The Tennessean earlier in 2018 that the hepatitis A virus is particularly difficult to contain because infected people can be contagious for as long as a month before they become visibly sick. Some people never become sick, but still spread the virus. "It can be a matter of 3 to 4 weeks before you get sick, so nobody knows you're infected, but you can still transmit the virus," Schaffner said. "That's why hepatitis A is so very hard to figure out from a public health perspective. You're always running behind the virus, you're always trying to catch up."

In recent years, large outbreaks have hit in California, Michigan and Kentucky, infecting hundreds and killing dozens. As of earlier in 2018, experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had determined that at least some of the Nashville outbreak appeared to have come from Louisville, where officials were recording as many as 4 new infections every day.

Tennessee's outbreak was announced in May 2018 when officials in Nashville confirmed they had seen an alarming spike in hepatitis cases. Of the first 14 cases identified, 12 appeared to be linked, and the other 2 patients became infected while traveling outside of the city. Since then, public officials have focused on promoting vaccinations among 3 target groups: recreational drug users, gay and bisexual men, and homeless populations. Officials have done at least some vaccination outreach in homeless communities and gay bars in Nashville, and several options exist for at-risk people to be vaccinated for free, if necessary.

"More than 36 000 doses of hepatitis A vaccine have been provided to those most at risk in our state and I believe this massive effort has made a huge difference in reducing the number of hepatitis A cases," said Dr Tim Jones, a Health Department assistant commissioner in a news release. "We urge anyone in the high-risk groups to get vaccinated as soon as possible, and will continue to work with state and local partners to provide hepatitis A vaccine to people at high risk for infection and educate people on how to prevent the spread of this disease."
