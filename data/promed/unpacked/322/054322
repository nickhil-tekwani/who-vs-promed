An outbreak of whooping cough [pertussis] has affected the Zumbrota-Mazeppa Public Schools. At least 11 children in Zumbrota-Mazeppa Middle School and Zumbrota-Mazeppa High School [in Zumbrota, Goodhue County, Minnesota] are confirmed to have the infection. Additionally, 80 children stayed home sick from Zumbrota-Mazeppa schools on Tuesday, 18 Nov 2014, although not all of the cases are related to the outbreak. Doctors and health professionals in the Zumbrota area were still tracking the apparent outbreak of pertussis on Wednesday, 19 Nov 2014. State, county, and local officials compared notes on the outbreak in a conference call.

Mayo Clinic Dr. Elizabeth Cozine said she has been treating confirmed cases in her clinic in Zumbrota. She wants people to know that if you know for sure you have been exposed to pertussis, you should call your doctor. She said you might not need to come to the clinic to be treated.

KTTC talked with the mother of an 8-year-old girl who is one of the 11 confirmed cases of pertussis. "What I did learn about my daughter's pertussis is it acts like the common cold," she said. "You have no idea that it's anything more severe."

The Minnesota Department of Health has taken interest in the outbreak as well. A conference call between the Department of Health and the health departments of Goodhue and Wabasha counties is planned for Wednesday morning, 19 Nov 2014.

The Minnesota Department of Health advises kids to get vaccinated so they can avoid whooping cough and for those suspected of having whooping cough to stay home from school.

The Grand Traverse County [Michigan] Health Department has confirmed 34 cases of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, including 12 new cases this week. 27 of the confirmed cases are tied to 2 schools, Grand Traverse Academy, a K-12 charter school, and Traverse City Area Public Schools (TCAPS). Health department officials say they are working closely with affected schools.

"We continue to actively monitor this situation and make adjustments to make sure we have adequate staff," said Mike Lahey, the emergency preparedness coordinator for the health department.

12 of the confirmed cases are associated with Grand Traverse Academy outbreak, up from 11 on Monday, 17 Nov 2014. The school of 1200 students reopened on Monday, 17 Nov 2014, after shutting down on 11 Nov 2014 because spread of the illness.

The health department says there are 166 probable cases linked to the charter school outbreak. Many more are being tested according to physician offices reports. This week Superintendent Susan Dameron, superintendent of Grand Traverse Academy, said all of the students at risk have taken the preventative antibiotic.

There are currently 15 confirmed cases at Traverse City Area Public Schools, up from 7 on Monday, 17 Nov 2014, according to Christine Guitar, director of marketing and communications for TCAPS. "We continue to work in close collaboration with the Grand Traverse County Health Department to identify possible cases and provide information about pertussis to families," said Guitar, who said there are also confirmed cases in other school districts and in neighboring counties.

"It is important that both children and adults are up-to-date on their immunization," the health department reiterated in Thursday's [20 Nov 2014] update. "Booster shots for pertussis are critical because, unlike some other vaccine-preventable diseases, neither the pertussis disease nor vaccine confers lifelong immunity."

Parents of students who attend Falmouth [Barnstable County, Massachusetts] schools have received written notification about a rash of cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Falmouth Schools Assistant Superintendent Nancy Taylor said that 17 students are currently out of school recuperating from the disease. Taylor said school administrators are in touch almost daily with state officials about the status of the situation at the schools.

In Massachusetts, pertussis is most common among people over 10 years old who have lost the protection they get from childhood vaccines, according to state health officials. All but one of the students who have pertussis were immunized, Taylor said. The treatment is to stay home on antimicrobials for 5 days before returning to school, she said.

Health officials in Idaho are attributing the increase in pertussis due to the low vaccination rates in the state. The number of cases in Idaho doubled from January to August 2014 from the same periods in 2012 and 2013.

According to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, of the 287 cases diagnosed through August 2014, one infant died.

There have been 31 cases of pertussis in the Pocatello and Idaho Falls area, with the highest number of cases being in Boise, Caldwell and Twin Falls.

[The risk for acquiring pertussis is certainly higher in the unimmunized. Overall, however, waning immunity in those previously vaccinated with the acellular pertussis vaccine seems to be, in most states, the explanation for a rise of cases. - Mod.LL
