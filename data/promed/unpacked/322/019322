As the spring lambing and calving period comes to an end, there have been many reports across the UK of deformed lambs and calves suggestive of in utero infection with Schmallenberg virus (SBV).

1st identified in 2011 in northwest Germany and the Netherlands, this virus causes disease in sheep, cattle and goats. SBV is spread by the _Culicoides_ midges, which are widely present across Europe and move easily between farms and regions allowing rapid and extensive spread of infection. The spread of infection, therefore, occurs predominantly when biting midges are most active between May and October.

With mild winter conditions, however, midge activity may extend into November and early December. As of March 2017, the Animal Health and Plant Agency (APHA) has confirmed SBV in lambs on 84 premises in England, 25 in Wales, and in calves on 3 premises in England. Cases have been reported from Cornwall to as far North as Northumberland. In Northern Ireland, antibodies to Schmallenberg virus were detected in the 1st quarter of this year [2017] in 2 calves with skeletal deformities from 2 different herds and a cow from a herd experiencing abortions and calf abnormalities.

Whilst an antibody positive does not confirm the involvement of the virus, it provides evidence that this virus is circulating again in Northern Ireland. Other cases in Northern Ireland included a 3-day-old calf born into a dairy herd which was presented for post mortem at AFBI laboratories with a cleft palate and severe limb and spinal deformities; and a term stillborn lamb submitted from a lowland flock in mid-February 2017. At necropsy, severe abnormalities of all 4 limbs of the lamb were noted. There was very little movement in spinal column, and the spinal cord was very narrowed. SBV was considered likely in both cases.

Many suspected cases of SBV, however, are not reported and confirmed, meaning we do not know the true extent of the problem. SBV is now considered to be an endemic disease in the UK. Discussion around protection against SBV should, therefore, form part of the flock/herd health planning that farmers do with their vets, who are in an excellent position to know what the SBV situation is within your area, as many of the deformed lambs and calves will need veterinary intervention at lambing or calving.

- What are the clinical symptoms of the infection?

Infection of non-pregnant sheep and cattle may go unnoticed, but infection of na√Øve pregnant animals, especially during the most sensitive period, can result in stillbirths or severe deformities of the foetuses and abortion. Sheep are most sensitive between days 28-56 of pregnancy, i.e. during the 2nd month of pregnancy.

Cattle are most sensitive between days 70-150 of pregnancy i.e. during the 3rd to 5th month of pregnancy. Other clinical signs in adult cattle include fever, a drop in milk yield, and diarrhoea. With the main risk of transmission of infection being May to October, most at risk are ewes or cows being served in summer and early autumn. For dairy herds, because of the potential production losses in lactating animals, there is clearly a risk throughout the active midge season.

- How long does natural immunity last?

Following infection, animals become immune, but how long that immunity lasts is unknown, and not all animals in the herd or flock may be infected, meaning some remain naive. Therefore, even where losses are experienced this year [2017], it does not necessarily mean that the herd or flock is not at risk of further losses next year.

- How can I protect my animals?

Protection against Schmallenberg is through keeping susceptible animals away from the vector (the midge) and vaccination.

Research into the use of insecticides against the _Culicoides_ midge species found a deltamethrin-based pour-on treatment to be an effective vector control method. In one study, even hair clipped from the feet of cattle 35 days after standard treatment contained enough deltamethrin to kill midges.

Whilst vector control methods are an important part of a Schmallenberg virus control strategy (and will certainly be useful at farm level), by themselves they are unlikely to be successful at controlling disease over a large area because of the behaviour and movements of the midges. Therefore, vaccination alongside an effective insecticide is the most effective way to protect your flock/ herd against SBV.

[SBV belongs to the Bunyaviridae family, within the Orthobunyavirus genus. It is a member of the Simbu serogroup viruses, which includes Shamonda, Akabane, and Aino viruses. The Simbu viruses that are most related to SBV are Sathuperi and Douglas virus.

As experienced decades back in countries affected by Akabane and Aino viruses, such as Japan, Australia and Israel, the ruminant population remained immune for several years following an episode of the disease. In fact, natural infection of young animals prior to their 1st pregnancy is rather advantageous, rendering them with natural immunity and preventing foetal infection/damage if/when exposed to the virus later during pregnancy.

Sheep, due to their relatively short pregnancy (5 months, compared to 9 in cattle) will be the 1st to demonstrate deformed offspring following their exposure to the SBV during pregnancy, earlier than pregnant cows that have been simultaneously exposed to the virus. - Mod.AS
