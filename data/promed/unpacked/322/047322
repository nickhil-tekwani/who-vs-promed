[While certainly the number of outbreaks has fallen since the
beginning of this problem in July 2007, the geographic distribution
of outbreaks still remains widespread. Please see the map attached to
the OIE report or look at
<http://worldmap.org/maps/prepared/churchstatus/morocco/morocco_popden.pdf>
to get an idea of the considerable distance between these 4 outbreaks.

For more information on this outbreak, see the summary statistics for
the 1st 9 follow up reports, very conveniently provided by Mod.AS in
his very informative comment on the OIE follow up report number 8
posting on Peste des petits ruminants - Morocco (08): genotyping
(archive no. 20081017.3290)

The vaccination strategy appears to be the same for this report as
the previous 2 reports, while there are only some changes with report
no. 8 issued on 14 Oct 2008. It is good the number of outbreaks is
reduced but PPR (or Kata) is indeed a difficult disease to fight.
Disease control officials in Morocco have been working against this
disease for about a year and a half. Hopefully the reduction in
reported cases is due to the extensive vaccination program, but we
will just have to see if the apparent progress is real and can indeed
hold up over time. - Mod.PC]
