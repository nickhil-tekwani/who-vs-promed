According to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, there have been 81 cases of yellow fever, including 14 deaths, in the country between 1 Jan and 14 May 2019. Most cases have been confirmed in Sao Paulo (68), with Parana (12) and Santa Catarina (1) also reporting cases.

Nearly all of Brazil is at risk of yellow fever transmission.

Advice to travellers:
- There is a widespread risk of yellow fever in Brazil.

- The World Health Organisation recommends the yellow fever vaccine for travellers to areas at risk of yellow fever (including all of Sao Paulo state and Sao Paulo city) unless contraindicated. Vaccination is advised for all of Parana, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul.

- The most recent yellow fever risk map of Brazil is shown here: https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/yellow-fever-distribution-and-areas-risk-brazil.

- A traveller's risk of yellow fever is determined by their general risk assessment (e.g., country visited, length of stay, city or rural, activities, etc.).

- Mosquito-bite-avoidance rules should be adhered to at all times; the mosquito that spreads yellow fever bites predominantly during the day.

[As has been noted frequently in previous ProMED-mail posts, yellow fever virus is endemic in Brazil and several other South American countries that have tropical forests where the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle is maintained. So far, in Brazil, the sylvan cycle has not spilled over to urban and suburban areas where _Aedes aegypti_ populations are abundant. Currently, vaccination is the best preventive measure available. The risk of adverse effects due to the vaccine is small, approximately one in 1 million. Yellow fever is a serious disease with a case fatality rate of approximately 30% and a potential for rapid spread in an urban situation with a population with low vaccination coverage and abundant mosquito vectors. - Mod.TY
