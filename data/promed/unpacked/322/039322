RIO DE JANEIRO -Brazil's southernmost state, Rio Grande do Sul, detected 28
cattle infected with Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), the highly contagious
viral sickness in Aug 2000 -- the first time the disease had resurfaced in
the region in almost 7 years.
Since the outbreaks were discovered in the state, a prime cattle and pig
farming region bordering both Argentina and Uruguay, the overall kill
stands at 11 087 animals -- the vast majority being cows, but also some
pigs, sheep and goats.
The Agriculture Ministry invited a team of US veterinary inspectors to
observe the measures and controls taken in Rio Grande do Sul, as part of
Brazil's ongoing negotiations to raise beef exports into the United States.
The team, from the U.S. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS),
is due in Joia Tuesday or Wednesday -- and is expected to remain in Rio
Grande do Sul until the end of this week.
The animal death toll is more than triple the 3 500 head of cattle
destroyed in Argentina, where FMD first re-emerged in the region in August.
Authorities in Argentina detected antibodies for the virus causing the
disease in 10 smuggled Paraguayan cattle found grazing on its northern
pastures.
In a bid to contain and wipe out the virus, the ministry quickly announced
a series of measures including a quarantine area, curbs on animal movement
and the slaughter of all animals considered at risk from the disease. The
central infection zone is around the town of Joia in western Rio Grande do
Sul near the Argentine border.
Movements of animals within the zone are restricted to the minimum
necessary, with curbs on movements of live animals or meat products to
other parts of Brazil.
FMD causes high fevers and blisters in cloven-hoofed animals that are often
a precursor to death. The disease can be contracted by cattle, pigs, sheep
and goats but only very rarely by humans.
Brazil had hoped that Rio Grande do Sul and its northern neighbor Santa
Catarina would win international recognition for being free of FMD, without
vaccination, next year. The idea was the 2 states, known as the Southern
Livestock Circuit, would lead a national drive to raise beef exports and
gain access to disease-wary markets including the United States, South
Korea and Japan -- which refuse to buy meat from countries whose herds may
run the risk of infection.
USDA officials have said Brazil must first identify the origin of the
outbreaks before negotiations on raising beef exports into the United
States can proceed.
Ministry officials are still investigating the mysterious reappearance of
the disease and have floated theories including sabotage and smuggling of
animals from infection risk areas. "The origin has not yet been
determined," said the Agriculture Ministry's Matos de Souza.
Brazil has long been expected to seek an import quota of 20 000 tons into
the United States, the same amount permitted its neighboring trade partner,
Argentina.
