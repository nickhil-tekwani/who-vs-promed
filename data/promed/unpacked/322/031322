A city in Viet Nam -- which one week ago declared itself free of bird flu
over the objections of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) -- today banned the sale of live poultry in
urban markets in a pre-emptive move against a recurrence of the epidemic.
Authorities in Ho Chi Minh City also issued regulations requiring that
slaughter take place only at government-approved facilities, which must be
located away from the densest part of the city.
The city, Viet Nam's largest metropolis, is reportedly planning to build 2
or 3 large slaughterhouses to meet demand. City officials' actions stand in
contrast to those of federal officials, who last week lifted bans on the
breeding, transport, processing, and sale of poultry even as they declared
the country free of the avian influenza detected in 57 of 64 provinces.
The country's new rules stipulate that all birds be certified by veterinary
inspectors prior to being sold, but the FAO questioned Viet Nam's ability
to enforce the order. WHO, meanwhile, voiced fears that Viet Nam was
putting its poultry industry ahead of public health. Bird flu killed 16
people in Viet Nam in this outbreak, more than in any other country.

Viet Nam declares avian influenza over
--------------------------------------
Viet Nam declared an end to its bird flu crisis on Tuesday, after one month
of no new recorded outbreaks of the virus that has killed 16 people and
devastated the poultry industry. Agriculture Minister Le Huy Ngo made the
announcement at a meeting in Hanoi on Tuesday afternoon last week, 3 months
after the first cases hit Viet Nam. Ngo said the country would lift the
bans on the transport, processing, and consumption of poultry across the
country.
"Containing the epidemic in a short time is a great victory, but how to
prevent it from recurring is a heavy task," the minister said. The meeting
heard [reports that] about 40 million poultry, or 15 per cent of the
country's stocks, were killed or culled across the country, with almost
half coming from the Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta provinces. The poultry
industry's losses are estimated at USD 190 million.
Ngo said the State would give affected farmers VND 5000 (USD 0.32) per
culled bird, VND 2000 (USD 0.13) per breeding stock [probably in addition
to the basic compensation per culled bird, thus a total of USD 0.45 per
culled breeding bird? - Mod.AS], with total s tate assistance coming to USD
13.73 million. The virulent H5N1 strain of avian influenza has spread
across many Asian countries since late 2003.

Thai poultry industry to restock
--------------------------------
The Thai poultry industry could be about to restock on a massive scale
after the devastation of the avian flu epidemic earlier this year. The
country's feed industry is set to import cargoes of Argentine soybeans as
the country prepares to declare itself free of the deadly virus.
Thailand is also looking to soymeal cargoes from India. The decimation of
the poultry sector in Thailand, which accounts for over half of commercial
feed consumption, has resulted in a steep decline in feed demand, but this
looks set to change. One Thai trader told Reuters that the domestic supply
of feed is not sufficient to satisfy the demand to restock. "There is no
other alternative," he said. "Domestic meal supplies are not adequate."
The Thai government is expected to declare by the end of the week that the
bird flu outbreak is over. The country, whose poultry export business
annually tops USD 1 billion, has been forced to cull over 25 million
chickens, and like other counties stricken by the deadly virus, the country
is desperate to restore its poultry industry.
As a safety precaution, farmers in affected areas will have to wait 69 days
after the declaration to restock farms. But not everyone is confident of
Thai assurances that the country is now free from the virus. After all, the
government denied the existence of the virus for weeks until irrefutable
evidence forced it to climb down.
In March 2004, FoodProductiondaily.com reported that Viet Nam was seeking
to import between 500 000 to 600 000 tonnes of corn for feed, even though
the FAO warned the country not to resume poultry farming too quickly.
According to the Vietnamese ministry of trade, there is a possibility that
import tariffs on corn purchase may be waived, opening the door to grain
exporters from Australia, Europe, and the US.
The move is supported by the Viet Nam Husbandry Feed Association, which
represents 138 feed processors in the country. It has warned of a possible
rise in feed prices of up to 1.5 per cent, with processors looking to
offset losses caused by bird flu.
However, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has warned that
countries affected by the deadly avian influenza virus H5N1 should not
restock their flocks too quickly to avoid the disease flaring up again. The
FAO says that before restocking, countries must prove the absence of virus
circulation by virus research, serological surveys and the use of
non-vaccinated susceptible chickens (so-called sentinels) on infected sites
to test whether they become infected.
