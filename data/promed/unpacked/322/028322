Public health officials said on Thursday [22 May 2014] that a San Luis Valley [Colorado] resident had been hospitalized after developing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome after exposure to [a] hantavirus.

Earlier this month [May 2014], a Saguache County [Colorado] resident died after being exposed to the virus in Rio Grande County [Colorado].

The commonest form of exposure to the virus comes from breathing dust containing deer rodent droppings or urine that's easily stirred up during spring cleaning.

[Although not stated in the report above, the virus involved in this hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) case probably is Sin Nombre virus (SNV), which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_). This is another reminder that this is the season for spring cleaning in North America, and closed buildings that have been unused over winter often provide habitats for deer mice and become sites for human exposure to Sin Nombre virus when dust is raised during cleaning. In addition to Sin Nombre virus, rodents are the principal hosts of 4 other hantaviruses known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in North America. Although Sin Nombre virus infections with HPS are relatively rare, the risk of death is significant.

An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg.
