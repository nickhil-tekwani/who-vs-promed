Soybean rust found in Kentucky for 1st time
-----------------------------------------------
Soybean rust, Asian strain (ASR) has been found for the 1st time ever in
Kentucky, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed on 18 Nov 2005. The
disease was found on kudzu in Caldwell County, the northernmost site where
rust has been found, USDA reported. Caldwell County is in the western part
of the state, and this is the 1st ASR find in Kentucky and now the
northern-most U.S. location this year [2005]. University of Kentucky plant
pathologist Don Hershman found the one leaf with rust lesions and pustules
among several he picked up in a Princeton kudzu patch in western Kentucky.
As the suspected ASR sample was the 1st in the state, it was sent to the
USDA lab in Beltsville, Maryland for confirmation, where it was confirmed
by real-time PCR and microscopic observation.
Hershman also said the kudzu patch with the infected leaf was about a mile
away "as the crow flies" from a spore trap at the UK Research and Education
Center that picked up "rust-like" spores 5 times this summer and fall
[2005]. That kudzu patch has been killed back by the cold temperatures.
A total of 9 states have been infected with soybean rust. USDA also
recently reported that North Carolina had 3 more positive counties: Greene,
Lenoir and Pitt. Alabama now has 31 counties reported positive with rust;
Florida, 23; Georgia, 35; Mississippi, 2; South Carolina, 23; North
Carolina, 18; Louisiana, one; Texas, one; and Kentucky, one. As the growing
season has finished or nearly finished in most regions, the threat of ASR
has diminished. It may be expected that rust will continue to be found in
more counties within states already reporting rust and in adjacent states
without causing any economic damage.
