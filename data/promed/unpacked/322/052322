[ProMED-mail thanks Rukshan Ahamed for this report on a fatal suspected 'flu' case in Jaffna, Sri Lanka. However it is not clear whether influenza is a suspected cause as the term 'flu' is used to describe the symptom complex of fever, sore throat, and nasal congestion. Any further information on the clinical picture of the case or post-mortem findings could be helpful in reaching a definitive diagnosis. - Mod.UBA
