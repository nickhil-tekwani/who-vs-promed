The Guernsey States vet has confirmed that equine grass sickness (EGS) has been found on the island.

The predominantly fatal disease, which affects grazing horses, ponies, and donkeys, causes abdominal pain, a distended intestine, and an increased heart rate. There is currently no vaccine or treatment. The Animal Health Trust confirmed a privately-owned horse died from the disease.

States Vet David Chamberlain called EGS "devastating", and said the cause was a mystery. He said he believed the unusual weather and rapid grass growth may have been a factor. Horse owners have been advised to remove their animals from the affected field, he added.

The States Vet would not confirm exactly where the horse died.

[The Bailiwick of Guernsey is a British Crown dependency in the Channel Islands, in the English Channel off the coast of Normandy, France. Although its defence is the responsibility of the United Kingdom, the Bailiwick is not part of the United Kingdom but rather a possession of the British Crown. It is not a member of the European Union, but has a special relationship with it, being treated as part of the European Community for the purposes of free trade in goods. - Mod.JW

Equine grass sickness (EGS, equine dysautonomia) is a frequently fatal disease of horses with a mortality rate in excess of 85 percent. EGS has been recognised for over 100 years since it was first reported near Broughty Ferry, Scotland in the 1st decade of the 20th century. Great Britain continues to have the highest frequency of cases in the world, although EGS also occurs in several northern European countries and an identical condition called 'mal seco' (literally translated from Spanish as 'dry sickness') has been recognised in Argentina, the Falklands, Colombia, and Chile.

Horses suffering from equine grass sickness show clinical symptoms indicating widespread autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Acute, subacute, and chronic forms of EGS are known to occur.

EGS, mainly investigated in Scotland and North England, is known there as characterized by a seasonal occurrence with maximal incidence recorded late April through June, almost exclusively in pastured horses. There is higher incidence of the disease in younger (3-5-year-old) animals, greater risk on previously affected premises, increased risk for animals moved recently onto new pasture. Occurrence is usually preceded by cool, dry weather (for reference, see commentary in ProMED-mail post 20030509.1154).

A 2010 scientific overview (ref 1) covered the main developments in EGS research since the disease was first recognised in 1909. It includes also results from EGS nationwide surveillance (see also at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21649713).

There is growing scientific evidence to suggest that EGS may be a form of botulism resulting from an overgrowth of _Clostridium botulinum_ type C and its neurotoxins in the intestinal tract, especially in the ileum. Research is ongoing, including the development and field trials of a vaccine. Reportedly, following the completion of a small pilot vaccine trial in 2013, a full-scale nationwide EGS vaccine trial is planned for 2014 (see EGS Vaccine Trial in http://www.equinegrasssickness.co.uk/ ).
