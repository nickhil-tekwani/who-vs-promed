Blueberry rust spreads
----------------------
Some of the state's commercial blueberry plantations have been infected with blueberry rust. The disease was accidentally imported to Tasmania in a blueberry shipment from Victoria in September last year [2014]. Originally, just 3 plants were infected, but that number has continued to skyrocket in the past 3 months.

[Tasmanian] Primary Industries and Water Minister Jeremy Rockliff said that despite the best efforts of Biosecurity Tasmania, the [disease] had penetrated the commercial market. "We are currently working with 2 growers where infected plant material has been identified, to assist them to undertake the required activities to eradicate the disease from their properties."

Mr Rockliff said surveillance statewide would continue. "There have been more than 65 000 blueberry plants and 26 000 potential [other] host plants physically inspected. To date, 35 residential properties have been detected containing blueberry rust-infected plants, with eradication activities completed at these sites. Surveillance has almost been completed at wholesale propagation nurseries [and] with commercial growers.

Plants should not be disturbed or moved, and care should be taken to ensure that clothes and equipment have not become contaminated.

[Blueberry (leaf) rust can be caused by the fungus _Thekopsora minima_, as is the case in Australia, and also another rust species (_Naohidemyces vaccinii_) elsewhere. The rust affects a range of plants in the Ericaceae family, including blueberry, billberry and cranberry (_Vaccinium_ spp.) and ornamentals such as rhododendrons and heathers. Symptoms may include yellow leaf spots on the upper surfaces of young leaves followed by orange pustules developing on leaf undersides which release the spores. In severe cases or on highly susceptible cultivars, leaves turn brown and drop prematurely resulting in serious defoliation and potentially death of the plant.

Rusts spores are spread by wind over long distances and by splashing rain and mechanical means locally. Infected plant material, including fruit and budwood, poses a high risk of spreading the disease. The rusts can overwinter on evergreen blueberry leaves or alternative hosts in milder climates. Southern highbush varieties are most susceptible. Disease management for rusts relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars, phytosanitation and control of pathogen reservoirs. Crop monitoring for early discovery of infection is important so action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogens as well as build-up of inoculum.

In Australia, _T. minima_ has previously been present in New South Wales and Queensland. Its spread to Victoria and soon after to Tasmania was reported in September 2014 (see links below). The source or route of the spread have not yet been identified.
