EDITORIAL VACANCY
-------------------
The International Society for Infectious Disease (ISID) is seeking
applicants for the position of Editor for the Society's journal,
International Journal of Infectious Diseases (IJID), to take office on 1
Apr 2002 for a term of 5 years. Responsibilities of the new editor may
precede this date to ensure a smooth transition.
The mission of the IJID is to bring to the world's infectious disease
community new information regarding important developments in epidemiology,
clinical care, and research. The Journal provides a unique opportunity to
influence the practice of infectious disease worldwide. The ISID also
administers ProMED-mail, an international on-line reporting system for
disease outbreaks. The new editor will have the opportunity to work with
the managing editor of ProMED-mail to enhance interactions between these 2
complementary publications of the Society. The Publications Committee of
the ISID will encourage the new Editor to develop creative new offerings
tied to the Journal, including electronic publications. Efforts to make the
IJID the journal of choice for papers of international interest will be
continued. The ISID Executive Committee, which will select the next Editor,
is intent on maintaining and enhancing the value of the IJID for the
world's infectious disease community.
Candidates for the position should send a letter of interest to Norman
Stein, Executive Director, ISID, 181 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115. The
applicant's curriculum vitae, bibliography, documentation of relevant prior
experience, ideas about possible composition of an editorial board, and
other qualifications and ideas for the Journal's future should be included.
