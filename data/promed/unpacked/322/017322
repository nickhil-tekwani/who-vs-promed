Anthrax case confirmed in Kinistino area
----------------------------------------
Anthrax, the word brings back memories of 2006 when hundreds of animals died of the infected spores in the ground all over the northeast. There is another case of anthrax in the Melfort area. On 23 Jul 2012 a case was confirmed in a small herd in the RM [rural municipality] of Kinistino, just northwest of Melfort.

Alex McIsaac, a vet with Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), said the producer noticed a sudden death in the herd and phoned his private practitioner. The practitioner suspected anthrax and conducted a test using a kit that he had. The test came back positive.

McIsaac said the samples in the test kit were sent to a laboratory in Lethbridge, Alberta, for confirmation of the diagnosis and the herd was quarantined. "We quarantined the farm because we don't want the animals to move off there," McIsaac said. "Quarantine, vaccinate them, and then it is up to (the producer) if they want to revaccinate." [Once is usually adequate. - Mod.MHJ]

"Further to that the carcass that is laying there, we will either try and bury or incinerate, preferably incinerate that carcass," McIsaac said. "It is a little easier to bury, but it is preferable to incinerate. When you bury, the spores are still there, you are just entombing them down in the ground. When you incinerate it you are getting rid of them," said McIsaac who was not sure what happened in [causing] this case. Both the vaccination and disposal of the carcass are done as quickly as possible.

With the vaccination he said the quicker there is protection the better and disposing of the carcass helps stop the spread of the disease. "We don't want scavengers tearing that all over the place. We don't want flies feeding on that because that is what can happen, they will feed on that and then fly over and bite this one or that one and spread it."

After the case is confirmed all the local practitioners are informed and asked by the CFIA to inform their clients of the outbreak and advise [them] to vaccinate against anthrax if they haven't done so already. McIsaac said having the vets tell the producers is key to stopping [further cases]. "It took us a while to get that going in 2006 but without the veterinarians, a couple of vet clinics were really heroes in stopping this thing last time because they got out ahead of it," McIsaac said. "We don't have that many vets to get out, the private practitioners got out, got everybody, and that is what saved us. The same thing will happen here and that word has already been spread out. We have notified the vets in the area saying there is appositive case in your area we advise you to talk to your clients about vaccinations."

It is the quick response of the private practitioner as well as the vaccination of many animals that will likely stop this single case from turning into an [epidemic] like the one in 2006. "No one used to vaccinate before [that anthrax epidemic]. Then the water brought the spores to the surface," McIsaac said. "Now a lot of people do vaccinate, in particular in that area that you are in. All the veterinarians advise their clients that is what they should do."
