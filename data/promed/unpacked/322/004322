[Additional information is required to assess the significance of this event, such as the vaccination history, the age(s) of the affected animals and their husbandry (beef or dairy cattle? kept indoors or grazing?).

Daliyat-el-Karmel/Isfiah is situated on the Carmel mount, less than 10 km (6.2 mi) from Haifa, one of Israel's 3 main cities. In Israeli terms, the location is rather distant from international borders: more than 50 km (31 mi) from Lebanon in the north or Jordan in the east and about 30 km (19 mi) from the Palestinian territory (West Bank). There are several large dairy farms within 10 km radius.

Traditionally, April-May are FMD's peak months in Israel. There is an abundant wild boar population in mount Carmel's wood.

The previous FMD event in Israel started in September 2018 and was declared resolved as of 17 Mar 2019 (final follow-up report dated 4 May 2019).

The event's virus lineage was given as O/ME/Panasia-2; it included 21 outbreaks in northern Israel; see interactive map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=27895. Notably, the most recent outbreak of the event (no. 21) involved free ranging cattle in Tamra, about 18 km (11 mi) from the current outbreak; it reportedly started 26 Jan 2019, resolved 17 Mar 2019 (follow-up report no. 7, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=29414). It would be interesting to check if the current outbreak might, in fact, be related to the previous event (genotyping?). - Mods.CRD/AS
