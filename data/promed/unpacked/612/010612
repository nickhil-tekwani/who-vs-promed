The median age of the cases is 55 years old (ranging from 16 to 87 years old). The majority of cases are men (59 percent). 26 cases (14 percent) are health care professionals. To date, all cases (excluding the index case) have been linked to a single chain of transmission and are associated with health care facilities.

Detailed information concerning MERS-CoV cases in the Republic of Korea can be found in a separate document (see related links).

Public health response
The government of the Republic of Korea continues to implement intense case and contact management activities. As of 10 Jul 2015, 566 contacts are being monitored, while a total of 16 102 contacts have been released.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Thailand (update) 10 Jul 2015
---------------------------
On [18 Jun 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of Thailand notified WHO of the country's 1st confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (see DON published on [20 Jun 2015]). The case, a 75-year-old male who travelled from Oman to Thailand, has now been discharged from hospital, having recovered clinically and after repeat laboratory testing showed no evidence of residual infection.

A period of 14 days has now also passed for all the individuals who were considered to be contacts of the case, with all those identified showing no sign of infection with MERS-CoV.

Public health response
With support from WHO, national health authorities in Thailand have implemented the following public health measures:

- enhanced surveillance at points of entry, healthcare facilities and at the community level through the network of Village Health Volunteers;
- performed regular risk assessments, heightened media monitoring and rumour surveillance, and established a dedicated telephone hotline;
- sensitized rapid response teams;
- improved diagnostic testing at designated laboratories;
- reviewed and strengthened arrangements for infection prevention and control, clinical management and healthcare facility preparedness;
- coordinated risk communication of appropriate messages to communities, travellers and healthcare workers.

Public Health officials continue to stress the ongoing need to maintain vigilance for possible imported cases in the future.

Global situation
Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1368 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 489 related deaths.

[It is a relief to see that the importation of a case of MERS-CoV infection into Thailand did not result in any secondary cases and that the imported case had a positive outcome. The question still remains as to where this individual was exposed to the MERS-CoV? Were there any other respiratory illness patients admitted to the same hospital in Oman when he was admitted there for his presumed cardiac symptoms?

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - The Philippines (update) 10 Jul 2015
-----------------------
On [6 Jul 2015], the IHR National Focal Point of the Philippines notified WHO of one laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Details of the case
The Philippines Department of Health confirms that a non-national, 36-year-old male who developed symptoms of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) on 30 Jun 2015 and had a laboratory confirmed positive result for the virus on [4 Jul 2015] will be discharged from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Manila today [10 Jul 2015]. His discharge follows 2 negative tests, 48 hours apart, which demonstrate that he is no longer infectious. He is now recovering and reported to be well.

Public health response
According to public health authorities in the Philippines, the case is cooperating with the investigation and complying with the public health measures that have been put in place. As a precautionary measure, 36 close contacts will remain under observation for 14 days after their last contact with the case, and further contact tracing is ongoing.

Epidemiological investigation showed that the case was not infectious prior to [29 Jun 2015]; consequently, observation of the case's flight co-passengers prior to [29 Jun 2015] will now cease.

Global situation
Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1368 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 487 related deaths.

[Hopefully, in the 6 remaining days of the 14 day incubation period (until 18 Jul 2015) since the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was confirmed (4 Jul 2015) in the Finnish male who traveled to the Philippines from the Middle East, there will be no additional cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed in any of the 36 close contacts under monitoring, and this importation will follow the route of the imported case in Thailand with no secondary cases. Fortunately, this individual has fully recovered as well.

As with the case in Thailand, one still wonders where the exposure to the MERS-CoV occurred...

The official global tally of MERS-CoV infected individuals reported to WHO is now 1368, including at least 487 related deaths.
