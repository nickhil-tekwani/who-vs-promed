Anthrax, bison - Canada: (NT)
-----------------------------
A quick update as of this morning [3 Jul 2010]:

So far we have detected 13 carcasses, 4 have been burnt and by the
end of today, hopefully at least 3 more will be on fire.

We are continuing to conduct fixed wing aircraft patrols of the
surrounding areas looking for any freshly dead animals -- next flight
scheduled for Tuesday, [6 Jul 2010]. We have not changed any of our
protocols -- routine surveillance for quick detection, treat
carcasses with chemical -- formaldehyde -- to discourage scavenging
and then follow-up with the burning procedures as quickly as crews
can respond. We are using approximately 1000 lbs [454 kg] of coal and
3500 lbs [1600 kg] of wood for each carcass to ensure a complete burn.

The outbreak area is in a remote location, approximately 110 km [68
mi] NW of Fort Smith. The area has been closed to the public and
airspace is restricted while burning operations are active.

Presently we also have Dr Dan Dragon here with us to guide burn crews
with things such as personal safety equipment and advise on
disinfection processes.

I would hate to speculate on what the trigger was at this point.

Forecast for next 3 days, average daytime highs of 15 deg C [59 deg
F], rain and thunderstorms with overnight lows of 10 deg C [50 deg F].

[The Slave River Lowlands are to the north of the Wood Bison National
Park and therefore comes under Troy's purview, not the park's. Dan
Dragon (<daniel.dragon@ehs.ualberta.ca>, Biosafety Officer, Office of
Environmental Health & Safety, UAB) did his dissertation on site
contamination in relation to historic, old, and recent cases, and
latterly about dead bison scavenged by foxes, wolves, and bears. This
scavenger-site contamination is very severe and significant.

According to Terry Armstrong (<terry_armstrong@gov.nt.ca>, Bison
ecologist] "At 15 deg C [59 deg F] and wet, horseflies are a
non-issue. At 20+ deg C [68 deg F], dry and sunny, they're highly
abundant, and at least 2 obviously different species." So as a
working hypothesis the index case was very probably from grazing a
contaminated site -- there is a long history of anthrax in this area
-- and if the subsequent affected individuals were bulls, as they
usually are with wood bison, it would have been from beating up their
moribund colleagues. - Mod.MHJ]
