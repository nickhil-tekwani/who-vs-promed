[1] Cholera - Congo DR: (Katanga)

More than 550 people have fallen victim to a cholera epidemic so far
in 2008 in Lubumbashi, capital of Congo's mineral-rich Katanga
province, medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said on
Friday [18 Jan 2008]. At least 8 people have died from the waterborne
illness in the city of around one million, and 104 are receiving
medical care at a treatment center set up by MSF's Belgian chapter.

"We are seeing that the worst hit people are those who live in the
poorest neighborhoods. That is where the people have no access to
drinking water and the hygiene conditions are poor," said Bertrand
Perrochet, MSF's emergency pool coordinator.

Cholera is endemic in many parts of Congo, which is still recovering
from a 1998-2003 war that killed an estimated 4 million people,
mainly through hunger and disease, and left infrastructure in ruins.
Health officials have recorded 150 new cases, including 5 deaths, in
the town of Bukama, about 300 km (192 miles) north of Lubumbashi
since 1 Jan 2008. Another cholera outbreak has been reported in
Likasi, 90 km (58 miles) northwest of Lubumbashi. However,
large-scale epidemics in Lubumbashi, the heavily populated capital of
Katanga, are relatively rare.

"The last major epidemic (in Lubumbashi) was in 2003. In Katanga,
there are of course outbreaks every year, but this year [2208] it
started very early during the dry season," Perrochet said.

The vast majority of cholera cases diagnosed in the current outbreak
are in Maputo and the adjoining city of Matola, according to
Mozambican Health Minister Ivo Garrido. Since the outbreak began in
November 2007, over 1000 cases have been diagnosed, and over 80
percent of these are in Maputo and Matola.

The cholera treatment center for the 2 cities has been set up in
Maputo's Mavalane hospital, which is seeing between 5 and 10 new
patients a day, said Garrido, cited in the Tuesday [15 Jan 2008]
issue of the Maputo daily "Noticias."

However, the situation in the southern province of Gaza is also
becoming alarming. The disease has been reported from the provincial
capital Xai-Xai, and the districts of Chokwe and Guija. Garrido said
that between 10 and 20 new cases are being reported every day.

The central city of Beira has also been struck by cholera, but here
there are only 2 or 3 new cases a day. In the northern province of
Cabo Delgado, the disease has been reported from the provincial
capital, Pemba, and from the district of Pemba-Metuge. Garrido said 4
to 6 cases were being diagnosed per day.

Cholera has also been reported from Guro district in the central
province of Manica, but the total number of cases diagnosed here is only 3.

No cases of cholera have been reported from the accommodation centers
established for almost 60 000 people evacuated from flood stricken
areas, particularly in the Zambezi valley.

[4] Cholera - Malawi: (Southern Province)

The health minister said on Tuesday [15 Jan 2008] 8 people have died
from an outbreak of cholera in southern Malawi, where flooding has
increased the risk of contracting the disease,

"Floods are worsening the situation because in rural areas people are
unable to satisfy the most basic human needs like hygiene, proper
sanitation, and safe drinking water," health minister Marjorie
Ngaunje told Reuters in an interview. "But we are trying to teach
people to wash their hands, boil water, and other important
information to help prevent the disease."

Ngaunje said there were 291 reported cases of cholera in the past 3
weeks in the southern part of Malawi, one of the poorest nations in
Africa. "In (the) 2001/02 rainy season we recorded 33 546 cases with
953 deaths, in the 2003/04 season we had 959 cases but only 13 people
died and in 2006/07 only 6 people died out of 309 reported cases," she said.

[6] Cholera - Viet Nam: (Hanoi), vaccination program

Nearly 400 000 individuals in Thanh Xuan and Hoang Mai districts in
Hanoi will receive free vaccinations against cholera before the Lunar
New Year, or Tet holiday. The announcement came on Sunday [13 Jan
2008] from the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology.

According to experts, this is the 1st time in the last 20 years that
the health agency has taken such a preventive measure in controlling
the epidemic in Hanoi. Vaccination gives good protection against
cholera within 6 months of the injection and has a 60-70 percent rate
of effectiveness.
