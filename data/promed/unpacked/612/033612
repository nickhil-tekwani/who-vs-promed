On [25 Oct 2016], one premise in Miami-Dade County, Florida was placed under quarantine for strangles, according to a recent Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) alert. Clinical signs began [18 Oct 2016]. No animals have left the facility since clinical signs began. This is the 4th case in Miami-Dade County and the 21st case for Florida in 2016.

Strangles poses no risk to humans, but is highly contagious and common among horses. Strangles is caused by infection with _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _equi_.

Symptoms include fever, diminished appetite, nasal discharge (that begins clear and turns purulent) and enlarged submandibular lymph nodes that can become abscessed. It is in the obstructed breathing caused by enlarged lymph nodes and in rare cases death by suffocation that the disease received its name. In most cases, infection with _S. equi self-resolves, but this disease has a death rate of about 10 percent, usually from complications involving spread beyond the head and neck, including pneumonia.

Transmission occurs by direct contact between animals and via fomites or water sources. Treatment can include chemotherapy with antibiotics if initiated in the very early stage of the disease or as post-exposure prophylaxis; otherwise, initiation of antibiotic treatment is not recommended due to evidence that it can prolong infection or inhibit formation of post-infection immunity. As about 20 percent of cases become asymptomatic nasal carriers, vaccination is the considered the best method of control.

[The state of Florida can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4592081,4730. A county map can be seen at http://geology.com/county-map/florida-county-map.gif. Miami-Dade is in the southernmost sector of south east Florida

A listing of the equine disease diagnoses in the US is available at http://equinediseasecc.org/outbreaks.aspx. The 20th case was diagnosed on 19 Sep 2016 on a premise in Hillsborough County, Florida [see ProMED 20160921.4503708]. On 16 Aug 2016, one premise in Volusia County, Florida was placed under quarantine for strangles. The horse began showing respiratory signs in late July 2016 and was isolated. A respiratory panel taken on 10 Aug 2016 returned PCR positive. This is the 1st case in Volusia County and case 19 for Florida in 2016 and as you scroll down you will find the other 18 cases for 2016. Horse owners in Florida would be wise to vaccinate their horses.
