The North Darfur Ministry of Health has reported that the outbreak of whooping cough [pertussis] in El Sereif Beni Hussein locality started in early September [2016]. As of 7 Oct 2016, 323 suspected cases were reported in the locality. The Health Ministry and the WHO are coordinating the response with partners to ensure that daily reporting, proper case management, and effective community mobilisation campaigns take place. A 3-month action plan has been prepared to deal with this outbreak.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported in its weekly bulletin that the Health Ministry -with WHO support- sent an investigation team to the locality mid-September. The team collected 13 samples that were sent to the National Public Health laboratory for analysis, 4 of which tested positive for [the pertussis bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_].

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières-Spain (MSF-E) initiated case management and a community awareness-raising exercise has been conducted. Preparations are underway to conduct a vaccination campaign for children under 5 in the locality.

Pertussis can be prevented by immunization and is part of Sudan's national immunization program.

[ProMED reported on pertussis outbreaks in the same area in 2013 and 2015.

Most of the morbidity and mortality of pertussis is in infants, especially those under 6 months of age where most of the mortality occurs in the developed world. The percent of people in North Sudan who are adequately immunized against pertussis is unclear.

Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea (breathing arrest) sometimes with hypoxia-induced (low oxygen) seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea, and cyanosis spells, required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care. - Mod.LL
