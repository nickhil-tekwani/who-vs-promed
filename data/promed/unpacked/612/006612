As of 27 Nov 2005, the Federal Ministry of Health reported to WHO a
total of 530 cases, including 131 deaths, with a case fatality rate
of 25.2 percent. These cases were reported from different localities
in South Kordofan State (Abu Jibeha, Abyei, Dilling, Kadugli, Lagawa,
Rashad and Talodi).
The 1.7 million doses of yellow fever vaccine from the Global
Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) emergency vaccine
stockpile arrived in Sudan this week-end. After 2 days of training
for national teams, a mass vaccination campaign will begin with
support from Medecins sans Frontieres (France), MEDAIR, UNICEF and
WHO. A Yellow Fever Outbreak Task Force consisting of these
organizations working with the Federal Ministry of Health, the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,
Sudanese Red Crescent Society and German Red Cross Society are
coordinating the response.
WHO has also provided technical support and materials (sprayers and
insecticide) for vector control activities.
A team from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network including
a virologist, logistician, entomologist, geographic information
specialist and epidemiologists are expected shortly to assist in
controlling the outbreak.
