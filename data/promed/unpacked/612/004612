The National Animal Health Centre has confirmed the infection of some animals in Libya with the foot-and-mouth [FMD] virus.

In a circular published yesterday [15 Jun 2019] the centre said that it had taken samples from animals from several cities including, Tripoli, Benghazi, Tajoura, Misurata, and Gharyan.

"The samples were transferred to the reference laboratory in the Italian city of Brescia at the end of last month [May 2019], where the initial diagnosis confirmed the existence of this disease", the centre stated.

It also pointed out that it is in the process of providing the FMD vaccine, in liaison with the regional and international organizations during the coming period.

[Since the start of the FMD serotype O event in Libya (25 Apr 2019), the country has reported a total of 9 outbreaks, involving cattle and sheep. The last outbreak, so far, started on 20 May 2019 in a sheep flock in Gharyan (map at https://goo.gl/maps/zFEQKvcduXCJVZ1x7) and was declared resolved on 12 Jun 2019.

OIE's interim summary of the 9 outbreaks within the continuing Libyan event, as of 12 Jun 2019, is as follows:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 54 / 22 / 4 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 660 / 153 / 65 / 0 / 0
A summary report with links to the follow-up reports, including an interactive map presenting the 9 outbreaks, is available at https://tinyurl.com/y2753cby.

Libya belongs to "FMD pool 3 - North Africa", together with Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia. The virus strain serotype O in Libya has not yet been genotyped; 3 Maghreb countries, western to Libya, have been suffering for some time an epizootic caused by an FMD-O virus strain which has been genotyped, in all 3, as topotype EA-3. The most recent available genotyping results are from Algeria (25 Apr 2019); this WRLFMD report is available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLMEG-2019-00031-ALG-GTR-O-O_001.pdf.

The Algerian event started on 20 Jun 2018, spreading widely throughout the country, affecting cattle, sheep, and goats, presenting high pathogenicity, particularly in sheep where a high case fatality rate was recorded. The OIE outbreak summary, as of 17 Jun 2019, is:
Total outbreaks: 317 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 1289 / 580 / 21 / 58 / 819
Sheep / 47 020 / 5804 / 2860 / 2 / 0
Goats 3837 / 348 / 195 / 5 / 0
The summary, including an interactive map, is available at https://tinyurl.com/yxee2fcg.

The Tunisian FMDV-O EA-3 event started 15 Dec 2018 and has been declared as resolved on 7 Mar 2019. The OIE summary says:
Total outbreaks: 14 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Sheep / 1323 / 75 / 21 / 0 / 0
Cattle / 164 / 40 / 1 / 0 / 0
Sheep & goats / 42 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
The summary, including links to all follow-up reports and an interactive map, is available at https://tinyurl.com/y27rbcpl.

The Moroccan FMDV-O EA-3 event started 1 Jan 2019 and is "continuing" (last outbreak started 2 May 2019). Its OIE summary follows:
Total outbreaks: 40 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 420 / 93 / 3 / 405 / 0
Sheep / 2174 / 130 / 93 / 1210 / 0
Goats / 245 / 16 / 12 / 183 / 0
The summary, including links to all follow-up reports and an interactive map, is available at https://tinyurl.com/yyehrvey.

The genotyping results of the Libyan FMDV-O strain are anticipated soon; likely, the Libyan strain is similar to the strain circulating in the Maghreb countries.
