All patients with suspected anthrax have been discharged from the Osh Interregional Combined Hospital. The diagnosis was confirmed at the laboratory in only one patient, while the rest had a negative result.

Eight people were hospitalized with suspected anthrax (carbuncular form). Epidemiological investigations found that 9 people took part in the slaughtering and butchering of a cow carcass. The meat was then distributed among residents of Taldyk, Toguz-Bulak, Kyzyl-Bairak and Besh-Moinok villages. A total of 285 contacts have been identified; all of them are taking antibiotics and are under medical supervision.

Quarantine has been introduced in Toguz-Bulak village until 25 Aug 2020. Residents are prohibited from bringing in or taking out any livestock from the village, as well as prohibited from slaughtering it.

The owner of a bull was fined 5500 soms [USD 71] because of anthrax spread in Kara-Suu district of Kyrgyzstan. The carcass of the dead animal was cut into 4 parts; the meat was distributed among local residents without permission from a veterinarian. Villagers' houses, belongings, and household appliances were disinfected in accordance with sanitary requirements. All cattle in the village have been vaccinated.

[The good news is that the cattle have been vaccinated against the disease, and the exposed individuals are receiving treatment.

Most likely, this was not a calf but a young bull, perhaps 18 months old. I cannot imagine how meat could have been distributed to this many people if the animal was a calf. However, if one animal has encountered the spores, it is likely that other animals have also. It would be wise for the owner and veterinarian to check the remaining animals.

I am sure those involved in the slaughter are also on antibiotics. The articles do not specifically state as such, but it is reasonable to assume so.

It would be useful to know how the animal encountered this disease. Was it grazing over an animal or human grave site? The anthrax spores, once consumed, would be the source of the full-blown case of anthrax.

Anthrax is an infectious bacterial disease of animals caused by the spore-forming bacteria _Bacillus anthracis_. It can affect human beings and a wide range of animals.

It is good to know the individuals involved are doing better. We wish them well. - Mod.TG
