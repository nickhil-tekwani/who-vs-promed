Detection and eradication of potato spindle tuber viroid in tomatoes in
commercial production in New South Wales, Australia. DL Hailstones

Australia is currently free of potato spindle tuber pospoviroid (PSTVd),
which causes serious yield reductions in infected potatoes and tomatoes.
Outbreaks in potato breeding programs in Victoria and New South Wales (NSW)
in 1982 were managed by eradication (1). PSTVd was also detected and
eradicated in breeding tomatoes in the Northern Territory (2) and more
recently was detected in greenhouse-grown tomatoes in New Zealand (3). In
Western Australia (WA) the pathogen was detected and subsequently
eradicated from the affected property (4).
Given that PSTVd can be transmitted via seed and pollen (5), a national
strategy was initiated to determine the extent of the PSTVd infection. In
June 2001, about 100 000 greenhouse-grown tomato plants were surveyed on 15
properties in Western Sydney, NSW. Symptoms associated with PSTVd infection
were observed on 2 plants of tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_, cultivar La
Belle, from a single property.
These plants were removed and their PSTVd status evaluated by 3 methods.
Sap from 1 plant was inoculated onto cotyledons of 6 seedlings of tomato
cv. Grosse Lisse (6). Uninoculated plants were maintained as controls.
Twisted and bunched shoot symptoms typical of PSTVd infection were visible
after 19 days. These plants tested positive for the presence of PSTVd in
molecular tests. Leaf lysates were prepared from 1 of the symptomatic
greenhouse-grown plants and extracted viroids were analysed using
sequential PAGE (7).
Total nucleic acids were separated by size on a native 5 per cent
polyacrylamide gel, stained with EtBr and the "viroid band" excised and
applied to a denaturing 5 per cent polyacrylamide gel (containing 8 M
urea). Viroids in the second dimension gels were visualised by silver
staining and compared in size with Citrus exocortis viroid (CEV, genome
size 378 bp).
Extracts from symptomatic (PSTVd-infected) plants displayed a single band
at a size smaller than CEV, consistent with the size expected for PSTVd. No
viroid band was found in non-infected tomato plants. Identity of the viroid
as PSTVd was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) of total nucleic acids from the 2 symptomatic plants identified in
the original survey, the 6 inoculated bioassay plants and 4 other
potentially symptomatic plants, using a One Step RT-PCR kit (Gibco Life
Technologies) and PSTVd-specific primers (nts 95-113 for the homologous
primer and 87-68 for the complementary primer).
All reaction sets included negative controls (water-only and nucleic acids
extracted from healthy tomato plants). Reaction products from the 2
symptomatic plants from the original survey, and the 6 seedlings inoculated
with sap from 1 of the original plants, produced a band at about 350 bp
corresponding to the predicted size of the PSTVd amplicon.No fragment was
amplified from the 4 plants collected in later surveys, or in uninfected
control plants.
To confirm the identity of the viroid as PSTVd, cDNAs amplified from the 2
original plants were subjected to direct nucleotide sequence analysis using
the primers from the initial amplification. The resulting sequence (Genbank
accession number AF536193) predicts a total size of 357 bp for the viroid
species present in these plants and when used as the query sequence in a
BlastN search, the amplicon was identified as PSTVd. The sequence most
closely matched that of isolate PTVCGA (Genbank Accession number M25199),
originally derived from potato (8), to which it shows more than 97 per cent
identity. In contrast, the isolate(s) sequenced from recent infections in
tomato in New Zealand and Western Australia were most similar to the
"Naaldwijk" strain (4).
The 3 distinct detection methods confirmed the presence of PSTVd in tomato
plants showing typical symptoms. Nucleotide sequence data suggests that
this variant was introduced from a source distinct from that responsible
for other recent incursions. To eradicate the pathogen, plants on the
affected property were deep-buried and greenhouses were sanitised with
sodium hypochlorite. Subsequent tomato crops were monitored every 3 to 4
weeks, but so far no symptomatic plants have been detected.
Greenhouse-grown tomato plants in NSW were being extensively surveyed for
PSTVd infection during 2002. Given the risk that PSTVd can be seed-borne
and that Australia remains free of this pathogen, these results suggest
import regulations pertaining to tomato seed may need to be more stringent.

[PSTVd causes significant crop losses in potato and tomato with yield
losses of up to 65 and 50 per cent, respectively. It occurs in many
countries, including the Americas, Asia, and Oceania. It also occurs in
western Europe (France, Netherlands, and eastern Europe). There are no
resistant cultivars of either host. Eradication appears to be the only
management option. PSTVd-infected potatoes are a trade issue, hence the
need for constant awareness of possible outbreaks. Surveys for PSTVd in
tomato were to be done in 2002. Do any of our readers in NSW have
information on the results of that survey? If you have information, please
let me know. - Mod.DH]
