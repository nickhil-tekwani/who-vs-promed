Vaccination gets under way as Europe takes its 1st deliveries
-------------------------------------------------------------
Vaccination against bluetongue is under way on the continent as farmers
attempt to get to grips with the disease that has devastated livestock
across Europe. France became the 1st country to roll out the vaccine this
week as Merial Animal Health delivered an initial order of 200 000 doses.
Under an emergency licence, the company has been allowed to distribute the
vaccine to vets in France, who have been urgently vaccinating sheep prior
to export.

The move came after Italy put pressure on France to begin an early
vaccination programme, refusing to accept stock that had not been
vaccinated. Vaccines were ordered by the French Government on 4 Mar 2008
and have been made available in just 6 weeks, despite setbacks at Merial's
Pirbright laboratory.

A spokesman for Merial said: "We did have initial supply problems because
we had been closed down following a leaky valve. Although that was fixed
within 24 hours, we didn't win back our SAPO [Specified Animal Pathogens
Order] licence from DEFRA [UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural
Affairs] for 3 months, but stock of the vaccine was being produced at our
plant in Lyon and has been waiting to go out."

France has ordered a total of 30 million doses of vaccine, splitting the
tender between Merial and rival firm Intervet, which is also producing
vaccine for the British market. Vaccine stocks have now been ordered
throughout Europe and it is hoped that a successful vaccination programme
could see the disease wiped out in the future.

This week Germany became the latest country to place an order, issuing a
tender for 21 million doses of the vaccine. Stocks have also been ordered
in Belgium and Holland where the disease has also decimated livestock since
it first hit in 2006. Europe is seen as key to the UK's disease status with
the threat of infected midges being blown over the Channel from the
continent. The build up of vaccine stocks across Europe is likely to put
further pressure on politicians in Scotland and Northern Ireland to order
their own stocks.

This week the National Beef Association (NBA) urged the Department of
Agriculture in Northern Ireland to place an order and be prepared if the
disease hits. Arthur McKevitt, NBA's Northern Ireland secretary said: "In
these circumstances it would be sensible for Northern Ireland to carefully
examine whether it should adopt a safety first approach and have vaccine on
hand in case it proves necessary to use it -- or take a risk on import
controls of live animals offering sufficient protection over 2008."

[2] Vaccination, The Netherlands

Bluetongue vaccination
----------------------
The minister of agriculture, Gerda Verburg, advises veterinarians to start
the voluntary vaccination against bluetongue in May [2008]. The 1st 2
million doses will be distributed to veterinary practices evenly throughout
the country, according to the number of ruminants (cattle, sheep, and
goats) served per practice. The advice is mainly directed to support animal
welfare and to minimise economical losses.

Veterinarians are strongly advised to make use of the 2 million doses,
available for the spring vaccination, in the following prioritised target
groups: cows (within 2 months before or after their insemination), breeding
rams, lambs intended for breeding, and breeding ewes and goats. There is no
ranking between the groups.

Explaining the said prioritisation, Verburg indicates that the main
bluetongue losses in cattle, last year [2007], were related to reduced
fertility and abortions. The fertility of breeding rams was affected,
likely due to bluetongue. Mortality was significantly high among sheep of
younger age. The inclusion of breeding ewes and goats is based upon export
considerations.

The 4 million doses, which will become available in July [2008], will be
delivered to veterinary practices upon receipt of orders. A specific
mechanism will be applied to safeguard the evenness of vaccine quantities
distributed to the ordering practices.

Bluetongue is present in the Netherlands since 2006; last year [2007], it
caused mainly a high mortality in sheep.

[The EU map showing the location of the restriction zones has been
prepared, as updated on 2 Apr 2008, and is available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bluetongue_restrictedzones.jpg>.
The entire territories of Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg,
and Switzerland are coloured red in the map, representing BT restriction
zones. BT restriction zones are composed of protection zones (100 km/62
miles) and surveillance zones (depth of at least 50 km (31 miles) extending
beyond the limits of the protection zone) around the infected farms.
According to EU laws, BTV vaccination can be carried out in protection
zones only. It seems that the entire Belgian and Dutch national territories
are termed protection zones, thus authorised to cover their entire
territories by the due vaccination. In France (south and north west), and
probably Germany and Switzerland (confirmation/information requested),
there are still areas where vaccination is not allowed. Similarly, no
vaccination is allowed in large parts of the UK such as Wales, Scotland,
and Cornwall. The EU rule, prohibiting the vaccination outside the
protection zones, seems to be in need of a thorough study.

The likelihood of successfully controlling and even eradicating BTV-8 in
the affected countries by mass vaccinations of all susceptible domestic
ruminants is debatable. In any event, a comprehensive, total vaccination
does not seem feasible at present in any of the affected countries, due to
shortage of available vaccine and to technical/financial reasons.

Is surveillance in (unvaccinated) sentinel animals, to assess the possible
continued activity and spread of BTV-8, considered in all vaccinating
countries? In traditionally BTV-infected regions outside Europe, where only
sheep are vaccinated, the role of sentinels is played by bovines. However,
European bovines (probably, including immune animals which have undergone
infection previously...) are to be vaccinated.

The Dutch programme with its stepwise timetable and prioritised target
groups makes sense and sounds practical. It will be interesting to obtain
information on the comparable schedules in the other affected countries. -
