Fill MA, Mullins H, May AS, et al. Notes from the Field: Multiple Cases of Seoul Virus Infection in a Household with Infected Pet Rats -- Tennessee, December 2016-April 2017.
--------------------------
In late December 2016, a female aged 18 years in Tennessee (patient A) developed fever, chills, anorexia, nausea, and hematuria. Approximately 1 week later, she was evaluated by her local physician and received a diagnosis of an unspecified viral illness. Laboratory testing at that time was notable only for an elevated creatinine level (1.27 mg/dL; normal = 0.60-1.10 mg/dL). She recovered from her illness without treatment or complications.

In January 2017, an outbreak of Seoul virus infection was identified among rat breeders and owners in Wisconsin and Illinois. CDC assisted Illinois and Wisconsin health officials in performing tracing of potentially infected or exposed rats, and in late January 2017, the Tennessee Department of Health was notified that pet rats owned by patient A were linked to confirmed Seoul virus-infected rats. On 14 Feb 2017, a follow-up specimen of patient A's blood tested positive for Seoul virus immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; she declined testing of her rats, although they were presumed to be positive in light of the patient's confirmed infection. Consistent with CDC guidance, the Tennessee Department of Health recommended euthanizing the rats; however, patient A refused. In collaboration with the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, an order of quarantine was issued to patient A, prohibiting movement of the rodents from her home. In addition, she and her family received extensive education about risk reduction techniques, including avoiding contact with rodent urine, droppings, saliva, and nesting materials.

In late April 2017, patient B, aged 38 years and the mother of patient A, was evaluated at a local hospital emergency department for multiple days of high fever, anorexia, fatigue, and shortness of breath. At the time of evaluation, her fever was 104.5 F (40.3 C). Laboratory testing was notable for a slightly elevated creatinine level (1.13 mg/dL) and slight thrombocytopenia (platelet count = 143 000/uL; normal = 150 000-450 000/uL). A blood specimen tested positive for Seoul virus immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Seoul virus RNA was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing. Although patient B lived in the same house as patient A, she only recalled one noteworthy exposure to rodent droppings, having cleaned some from a bathtub approximately 3 weeks before her illness onset.

Seoul virus is a rodent-borne hantavirus, which has been associated with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome*, and has a mortality rate of approximately 1-2 percent (1). It is transmitted by the brown Norway rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), which is found worldwide (2,3). As of January 2017, 17 laboratory-confirmed acute human cases of Seoul virus infection associated with pet rat contact have been identified in the United States as part of this outbreak investigation (4). To prevent human cases of Seoul virus infection, CDC recommends testing pet rats for Seoul virus infection and taking measures to avoid unprotected contact with infected rats or their urine, droppings, saliva, and nesting materials, and after safe cleaning techniques (1). Euthanasia is recommended for rats with Seoul virus infection; however, this guidance might not be heeded. For certain persons, such as rat breeders, these animals are a financial investment; for others, they are personal pets with which owners might have a substantial emotional attachment. Owners who choose to keep a potentially infected rodent place themselves, other household members, and visitors at risk for infection. Additionally, Seoul virus is easily transmitted within breeding colonies of rats, further propagating the virus and risk for human illness. This report demonstrates ongoing risk for Seoul virus infection for persons living in or visiting households with Seoul virus-infected rodents. Adherence to recommendations for euthanasia will help to mitigate ongoing risk for Seoul virus morbidity and mortality in humans.

[Occurrence of Seoul virus in pet and laboratory rats is not unusual. Although most reports are of Seoul virus in wild rats, the virus has also been isolated from laboratory and pet rats. Clearly, public education is necessary for individuals to understand the risk that they run for developing severe disease by having Seoul virus infected animals in their homes. Unfortunately, the individuals mentioned above did not appreciate that risk.

Seoul virus is widely distributed around the world. Dr Jan Clement has provided a good overview of Seoul virus worldwide distribution (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20141028.2907225). - Mod.TY

http://www.kolotv.com/content/news/Washoe-County-resident-dies-after-contracting-hantavirus-450456913.html


A Washoe County resident who had contracted hantavirus has died, the Washoe County Health District confirmed late last week.

It is the 2nd case of hantavirus this year [2017], an unusual occurrence because Washoe County has never recorded more than one case in any single year.

According to health officials, the resident more than likely contracted the virus while working in an enclosed area, garage, barn or shed in the south Reno area where residents are reporting heavy rodent activity. It is the 1st recorded death of a Washoe County resident associated with the virus since 1995.

"A human case of hantavirus is extremely rare, but when it does occur, it can be deadly," said Dr. Randall Todd, Director of the Washoe County Health District Epidemiology Program. CDC statistics indicate that on average 38 percent of hantavirus cases are fatal. "This fatality, the 1st in over 20 years, indicates the seriousness of this virus. We urge everyone to take precautions when cleaning, working, or recreating in areas where mouse droppings and/or urine may have collected. When waste particles are aerosolized by cleaning, sweeping, vacuuming, or tramping, and those particles are breathed in, people are at risk for contracting the virus."

The Health District is advising that people take extreme precautions when entering spaces where mice may have been, particularly during this time of year, as the rodents seek shelter indoors from the colder outdoor temperatures. Statistics indicate that 30 percent of deer mice tested are carriers of hantavirus [The prevalence of virus in deer mouse populations varies over time and from place to place. - Mod.TY].

"People cleaning for the holidays, retrieving decorations from storage spaces, and even people hunting and camping that are using cabins and campsites should be cautious," Todd added.

There are specific guidelines to follow when cleaning in areas with mouse activity:
- Do not stir up dust by sweeping or vacuuming up rodent droppings, urine or nesting materials;
- Always spray the area being cleaned with a disinfectant, and let it sit for 5 minutes before starting to work;
- Wear protective clothing like gloves and a face mask to keep from touching and breathing in viral particles;
- Set out traps to kill mice and other rodents;
- Double-bag dead rodents in plastic sacks before disposing of them in the garbage; and,
- Identify and plug openings that may allow rodents entry. A deer mouse can fit through an opening the size of a nickel. Plug holes using steel wool, and put caulk around the steel wool to keep it in in place.

Health officials stress that human cases of hantavirus infection are extremely rare, but can be deadly. The disease severely affects the lungs. Flu-like symptoms that can appear one to 8 weeks after exposure can include muscle aches, particularly in the large muscle groups of the thighs, hips, back, and sometimes shoulders. Later symptoms include coughing and shortness of breath.

Anyone showing these symptoms after contact with deer mice and their waste should seek medical attention immediately. Although there is no specific treatment, cure, or vaccine for hantavirus infection, if infected individuals are recognized early and receive medical care in an intensive care unit, they may do better.

[This is the same case reported on 19 Sep 2017 (see Hantavirus - Americas (50): Panama (VR), USA (NV) 20170920.5329583). Unfortunately, this patient likely died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The hantavirus involved in this and, doubtless, earlier cases in the western USA is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time. No clinical information is provided for the case above or about whether it is HPS, nor is there any information about the circumstances under which this infection was acquired.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the CDC recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg.
