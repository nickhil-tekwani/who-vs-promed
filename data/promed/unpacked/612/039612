Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of dead fish floating
in a North Coventry pond and lying on its grassy
banks caught the eyes and noses of many in Kenilworth Park by surprise.

"I come here every week and it's incredible how
many dead fish there are ... and it's never been
like this," said [a resident] of Pottstown. "You
can smell the dead fish for sure. It's real bad."

[The man] said the last time he was at the park,
the pond looked the same as it did Tuesday [13
Jul 2010], with the exception of all the dead
fish carcasses and the pungent odor they produced.

Attempts to reach officials with North Coventry
Township were unsuccessful Tuesday.

A reporter who stopped at the township office to
speak with Township Manager Kevin Hennessey at
approximately 3:15 p.m. was told Hennessey had
left the office for the day. The reporter was
told to contact Jay Erb, the chairman of the
Parks and Recreation, by e-mail. That attempt was also unsuccessful.

A North Coventry resident said in all the years
he had been going to the park he had never seen
the conditions like they were Tuesday.

"Normally it looks like this with, the green
algae film, but I've never seen the dead fish
like this and I've been here since I'm 7 years
old," he said, recalling days of ice skating and
fishing at the pond. "I've never seen anything like this."

"I started to smell the smell, and then I got up
and walked around and I saw all these dead fish,"
the man said. "It upset me .... it blew my mind."
He guessed it could have been pollution or
perhaps something leaked into the water, noting
that "even when it got hot in years before, I've
never seen anything like this before." He said he
saw a township truck out at the park on Monday
[12 Jul 2010] and took note that the township
employee saw the dead fish, but then got into the
truck and drove away. He said he had not seen any
other activity from any township or Fish and Game officials Tuesday.

[Another 2 women] of Pottstown, said they saw the
dead fish in the pond on Sunday [11 Jul 2010].
Among the dead fish were bluegills and carp, with
at least 2 of the carp several feet in length.

[One of the women], who is studying environmental
sciences, said she thought the problem may have
been a lack of oxygen in the water caused by the
recent heat wave. "We've been up there before and
I've never seen anything like that," she said
[and noted] that there was a man at the pond both
Sunday and Monday [11-12 Jul 2010] wearing a
wildlife management shirt who she believed to be
a park ranger. She said the man commented that he
didn't know how they were going to get the dead fish out.

"I was talking to the park ranger and he had no
idea what had happened," she said. "He said it
happened overnight. He was talking to a fisherman
who said (the pond) was fine" Saturday [10 Jul 2010].

She and her sister returned to the pond Monday
[12 Jul 2010] and the same man she believed was a
park ranger was there again. "The park ranger was
back and he said that they had unplugged one
well. There's 3 wells at the bottom of it, and
they unplugged one to see if it would help with
the oxygen flow," she said she was told.

She said she also heard a fisherman at the pond
Monday ask the man she thought was a ranger how
they were going to clean up the dead fish, and the ranger said he didn't know.

At Long Lake, hundreds of dead carp are washing
up on beaches, collecting under docks and
creating a stink for residents living along the 24-mile [39 km] reservoir.

"If you're water-skiing on the lake, you see them
constantly," said a Suncrest resident who started
noticing the dead fish about a week ago. "There's
so many of them. ÂŠ It's going to be nasty when they really start to decay."

The die-off puzzles officials at Avista Corp.,
who wonder if a virus is to blame. Carp is the
primary fish species that appears to be affected,
said Hugh Imhof, a spokesman for Avista, the
owner of Long Lake Dam, which creates the reservoir on the Spokane River.

"We don't think it's a water quality issue,"
Imhof said. "We haven't spotted any algae blooms on the lake this year [2010]."

The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife
sent out an officer to investigate the fish kill
over the weekend [10-11 Jul 2010]. Officer Bob
Weaver said he spotted dead aquatic plants as
well as dead carp, which could indicate low
oxygen levels. He forwarded the information to
the agency's fish management division, whose
Spokane office was closed Monday [12 Jul 2010] as part of a statewide furlough.

Bottom-dwelling carp are abundant in Long Lake,
where they reach weights of up to 15 pounds [7
kg] or greater. They spawn in June, creating roiling patches in the water.

The carp are easy prey during spawning season.
Hunters are allowed to harpoon the carp or take
them with a bow and arrow. Avista initially
received reports of about 60 speared carcasses
dumped into the middle of the lake, Imhof said.

Later, more dead carp were spotted, and the
carcasses didn't show evidence of hunting, he
said. Now, residents said they've seen hundreds
of dead carp in the reservoir. The carcasses are
tangled up in patches of aquatic weeds.

[A woman] and her husband, collected a bucketful
of bloated carp from the beach of their Nine Mile
Falls residence. "It's really a horrible smell --
something between dead fish and rotting flesh," she said.

The couple lives near a slow-moving stretch of
the reservoir that grows lily pads. In addition
to the dead carp, [the woman] said she spotted a
handful of other dead fish, including bass, crappie, and perch.

Another Nine Mile Falls resident, said she has
about 30 dead carp floating off her beach. "We
need to know what to do with them," she said. "I
feel sorry for the neighbors. Their daughter's
getting married in their yard later this month."

In Idaho, reports of dead fish have also turned
up at Spirit Lake and Blanchard Lake. In those
areas, fluctuating water temperatures are the
culprit, said Jim Fredericks, regional fishery
manager for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game.

May and June are stressful months for warm-water
fish, such as bullheads, perch, bass, crappie,
and sunfish, he said. The fish are spawning,
which requires lots of energy, and they're
sensitive to rapid changes in water temperature.

Cooler-than-normal temperatures in May and June
[2010], with a few hot days mixed in, resulted in
thermal shock in some fish, he said. Several
dozen dead fish were spotted near the shorelines,
but "it's not what I'd call a major die-off," Fredericks said.

[In both cases low water oxygen and high water
temperature may be to blame. Colder water has
more dissolved oxygen, so less oxygen and higher
water temperatures can be detrimental to a variety of fish.

Large numbers of dead fish on banks and beeches
will create quite an odor. But the dead fish are
also the perfect medium for _Clostridium
botulinum_ to grow. Then the flies arrive and lay
their eggs which molt to maggots that accumulate
the botulism. Birds arrive to eat the maggots and
birds will die of botulism poisoning.

The fish will have to be picked up.

The 2nd story may be a virus, such as Koi herpes
virus. Carp are a type of Koi. However there is a
mention of perch and bass being affected, which may rule out koi herpesvirus.

However, a heat wave, especially over the eastern
seaboard of the US, including Pennsylvania has
left animals and people alike suffering. Idaho,
has not had quite the heat wave the eastern coast line has.
