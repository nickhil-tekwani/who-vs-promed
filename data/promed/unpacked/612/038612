Headlines
- On 24 Oct 2019, World Polio Day, an event will be held at the WHO to mark the potential certification of eradication of wild poliovirus type 3. With no poliovirus type 3 detected anywhere in the world since 2012, the Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication (GCC) is anticipated to officially declare this strain as globally eradicated. The event will also be broadcast live on the internet. Viewers are welcome to follow the proceedings of the event through a WebEx broadcast that will be available at https://who-meeting.webex.com/webappng/sites/who-meeting/meeting/info/139469020578455187?MTID=mc6de133ddfff591d99190733c4b8ef67.

- In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, an Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) conducted in the country noted operational and Coordination improvements and strengthened government ownership in support of the outbreak response. As a result, 3 genetically-distinct outbreak strains have been successfully stopped and recommended for closure, demonstrating the effectiveness of outbreak response measures, if fully implemented. At the same time, however, the OBRA noted that the strengthened political ownership now needed to rapidly translate into uniformly high-quality outbreak response, including through appropriate use and management of mOPV2, effective implementation of accountability framework to ensure high quality campaigns to urgently stop the remaining outbreak lineages and prevent further strains from emerging in the future.

- On [16 Sep 2019], the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) held its 22nd meeting.

[Observations:
WPV1 is still circulating in Pakistan (and quite likely in Afghanistan). Several Indian media outlets have published articles in the past 24 hours stating that the Taliban have resurfaced in Pakistan and are threatening woman and children, especially vocally banning polio vaccination. I have not been able to confirm this from unrelated media sources as yet, but if so, it definitely contributes to the continued circulation of the WPV in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa tribal areas where the Taliban have been active.

As for the cVDPV activity, new cases have been confirmed in the DR Congo, CAR and the Philippines. It is too soon to definitively state that transmission has been interrupted in other countries that have not reported new cases but did report cases in 2019.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 20 countries: 12 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 3 in the Western Pacific.
