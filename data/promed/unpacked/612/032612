Health officials say ice cream from a western Pennsylvania dairy
that's had problems with milk may also be tainted.

The state Department of Health says consumers and retailers should
discard all ice cream purchased from the Brunton Dairy as a
precautionary measure, after a test showed the same bacteria that
sickened 16 people who drank the dairy's milk.

The family-owned Brunton Dairy in Independence Township, Beaver County
continues to cooperate with the Department of Health's investigation
into yersinia bacteria and voluntarily stopped producing milk and ice
cream since the last week in July 2011.

The bacteria were discovered in an unopened container of ice cream.

The number of people sickened with yersiniosis from pasteurized milk
sold by a Pennsylvania dairy has risen to 16 from 5 at the end of July
2011, and now state and county health officials are telling consumers
to discard any ice cream purchased from the Brunton Dairy farm after
an unopened container tested positive for _Yersinia enterocolitica_.

Christine Cronkright, state health department spokeswoman, said 16
cases of _Yersinia enterocolitica_ have been reported to date as a
result of the outbreak, 9 from Beaver County and 7 from Allegheny
County.

The Sewickley Patch reports a consumer provided the unopened ice cream
to the Allegheny County Health Department, which conducted the lab
testing. Additional testing on ice cream products from the dairy is
still under way through the Department of Agriculture.

Ice cream and bottled milk production has been suspended at the dairy
since the last week of July 2011.

[The isolation of _Yersinia enterocolitica_ (presumably the same
outbreak strain) from ice cream from the dairy, the "smoking" ice
cream, strongly suggests that the contamination of the milk did not
occur after leaving the dairy. Since yersiniae can multiply at
refrigerator temperatures but not at freezer temperatures, one would
think that the milk would be a higher risk vehicle than ice cream. It
has not been stated, indeed, that ice cream has been felt to be a
vehicle in this outbreak. Freezing will not, however, kill the
organism. - Mod.LL
