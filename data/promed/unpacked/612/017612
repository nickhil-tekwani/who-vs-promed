In a medical mystery involving one of Detroit's largest hospitals, [14] patients, all in the same unit at Henry Ford Hospital, contracted salmonellosis last week [week of 21 Sep 2015]. The hospital is working with state officials to try to figure out the source of the outbreak, but so far, no one knows where it came from.

Usually salmonellosis is associated with contaminated food, but officials say it does not appear to be a food-related issue. They are still trying to find the source of the salmonella.

"7 patients remain in the hospital and are doing well and are isolated as an added safety precaution," Henry Ford Hospital said in a statement. "No new patients have been identified this week. There's no evidence at this time that the illness is food related."

If it's not food related, where did it come from? "Salmonella can be transmitted basically by anything that enters your mouth, whether it's a dirty hand, touching something that has salmonella and touching your mouth, or food," said Dr Frank McGeorge. "In a hospital setting, it could be just about anything, and that's where the detective work happens and really has to take place."

Salmonella isn't typically life threatening and in most cases goes away in less than a week, even if untreated. Dr McGeorge says typical symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. "If it gets more severe, they can develop a fever and ultimately, it can become bloody diarrhea," McGeorge said. "That's when it becomes much more concerning. The hospital acted immediately by restricting the patients by identifying them, by treating them and by preventing any further spread. So they reacted to this issue as quickly as possible and as efficiently as possible."

The 7 patients that have been released are not a threat to anyone around them. As for the others still in the hospital, they could still be there because of what brought them there in the 1st place.

[In the publication by Lee and Greig (reference below with its abstract), only 60 per cent of the hospital-associated outbreaks were identified to be directly foodborne.

Lee MB, Greig JD. A review of nosocomial _Salmonella_ outbreaks: infection control interventions found effective. Public Health. 2013; 127(3): 199-206; http://www.publichealthjrnl.com/article/S0033-3506(12)00462-3/fulltext.

"Objective: To review nosocomial salmonellosis outbreaks to identify mode of transmission; morbidity and mortality patterns; and recommendations for control and prevention.

"Design: Documented nosocomial salmonellosis outbreaks in hospitals published from January 1995 to November 2011, written in the English language, were systematically reviewed.

"Methods: The study methodology incorporated steps from the PRISMA [preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses] statement for a high quality review process. Computer-aided searches of Scopus [abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed literature], CAB Global Health [bibliographic database of international research and development literature] , and CINAHL (R), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were completed to identify relevant outbreak reports written in English. To validate the electronic search methodology, bibliographies and reference lists of relevant review articles were hand-searched. Public health and government websites were searched for nosocomial salmonellosis.

"Results: 52 relevant reports were identified. The most frequently reported routes of transmission were food 31/52 (59.6 per cent) and person-to-person transmission 7/52 (13.5 per cent). Actions taken during the outbreak to control transmission included improvements to: 1) infection control practices (41.8 per cent of actions); isolation or cohorting patients, hand hygiene practices, and enhancing cleaning and disinfection in patient care areas; and 2) food handling practices (24.4 per cent of actions); reviewing food preparation practices, enhancing cleaning and sanitation of the kitchen, and controlling food temperatures. Investigators made recommendations retrospectively in outbreak reports to provide direction to health centers but these recommendations were not statistically evaluated for effectiveness.

"Conclusions: More emphasis should be placed on improving food handling practices, such as training food workers, monitoring food temperatures, and not using raw foods of animal origin, to prevent nosocomial salmonellosis outbreaks in hospitals because almost 60 per cent of the outbreaks were foodborne."

It seems that all 14 cases were acquired simultaneously in one particular unit, suggesting that at least the hospital-supplied food, distributed to many more than one unit, is not the vehicle here. It is possible that food brought into the facility by a patient's relative or a staff member, and shared only on the unit could be responsible. Although person-to-person, non-foodborne, transmission for salmonellosis is possible, the infectious dose to transmit salmonellosis tends to be quite high, but it can be lower among patients who do not produce acid in their stomachs due to disease or medication. The attack rate on the unit, and whether staff members were affected, is not stated. - Mod.LL
