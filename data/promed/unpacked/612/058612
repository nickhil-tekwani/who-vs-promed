News of the response
Surveillance
------------
The investigation team sent to Komanda [North Kivu] began the work of contact identification and vaccination this Mon 17 Sep 2018. Upon arrival, the team was faced with resistance from the population. After a sensitization session by the community leader, tensions eased slightly and several contacts volunteered. So far 25 contacts have already been registered.

Vaccination
-----------
Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 9721 people have been vaccinated, including 3826 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 3123 in Beni [North Kivu], 1442 in Mandima [Ituri], 624 in Butembo [North Kivu], 300 in Katwa [North Kivu], 220 in Masereka [North Kivu], 121 in Oicha [North Kivu], and 65 in Kinshasa (medical staff to deploy).

[Involvement of community leaders always seems to be most effective at transmitting important information, as these individuals are trusted far more than outsiders. Other respected members of the community, such as elders and religious leaders, also will have a better chance at educating the population compared with professionals and volunteers from other countries, in spite of their very best intentions. That doesn't mean outsiders should not try to work with the community to change perceptions, but assistance from locals will likely make a big difference. - Mod.LK]

- Tue 18 Sep 2018. - WHO/AFRO Weekly bulletin on outbreaks and other emergencies (week 37: 8-14 Sep 2018)
[WHO Health Emergency Information and Risk Assessment, edited]
http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/274452/OEW37-0814092018.pdf

Week 37: 8-14 Sep 2018. Data to 14 Sep 2018.
Event description
-----------------
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be closely monitored. Since our last report on 7 Sep 2018 (Weekly Bulletin 36), 6 new confirmed EVD cases and 3 new deaths have been reported. On 12 Sep 2018, 17 further suspected cases were under investigation to confirm or exclude EVD.

As of 12 Sep 2018, a total of 137 confirmed and probable EVD cases [142 cases as of 16 Sep 2018/MoH data -- see above], including 92 deaths (case fatality ratio 67.2%), have been reported. Of the 137 cases, 106 are confirmed and 31 are probable. Of the 92 deaths, 61 occurred in confirmed cases. A total of 17 health workers have been affected, of which 16 are confirmed cases and 3 have died. Since the onset of the outbreak, 37 case-patients have recovered from the disease and were discharged and re-integrated into their communities. Of the 113 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, females account for 55% (n=62), and the largest proportion (26%, n=29) of cases were aged 35-44 years.

The Mabalako health zone, the epicentre of the outbreak, continues to record the majority of cumulative cases reported to date, accounting for 64.9% (89/137) of cases, followed by Beni with 18.2% (25/137) of cases. Of the 12 confirmed and probable cases reported since early September 2018, 7 are from Beni [North Kivu] health zone, while 6 other health zones (Butembo, Oicha, Musienene, Masereka, Kaluguta [North Kivu], and Mandima [Ituri]) have reported confirmed and/or probable cases.

Of the 8 health zones reporting confirmed or probable cases 5 have ongoing contacts: Mabalako, Beni, Mandima, Butembo, and Masereka. As of 12 Sep 2018, a total of 1751 contacts were under follow up, of which 1589 (91%) were seen on the reporting day. This relatively low follow up can be explained by low monitoring observed in Butembo and Masereka health zones.

Alerts have been reported and investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as its neighbouring countries, namely Burundi, Central African Republic, Rwanda, and Uganda, and to date, EVD has been ruled out in all these alerts.

Public health actions
---------------------
- All public health measures continue to be implemented in key areas of the response; coordination of response activities, surveillance, laboratory services, medical care, infection prevention and control, vaccination, communication, logistics and psychosocial care.

- Systematic monitoring and rapid investigation of all alerts continues in all provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries.

- As of 12 Sep 2018, all 37 points of entry in Democratic Republic of the Congo (Beni, Goma, and Tshopo) are functional for health screening. A new checkpoint has been installed at Kyaghala in Butembo health zone. Since the beginning of the screening, over 2.9 million travellers have been screened, and 35 alerts have been reported, of which 7 have been validated. Activities to strengthen capacity at points of entry in neighbouring countries as part of preparedness are ongoing in collaboration with partners.

- As of 12 Sep 2018, a total of 8673 people have been vaccinated since the beginning of the vaccination exercise on 8 Aug 2018. The current vaccine stock available is 2750 doses.

Situation interpretation
------------------------
In the 6 weeks since the EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was declared, progress is continuously being made to contain the disease. The situation in Mangina, the initial epicentre of the outbreak, has stabilized, and focus has now shifted to Butembo and the new health areas that have reported confirmed EVD cases. Currently, the major issues of concern include potential undocumented chains of transmission, reluctance by some communities to adopt Ebola prevention behaviours, spread of the disease through healthcare facilities with poor infection prevention and control measures, delays in patients reaching Ebola treatment centres once they develop symptoms, and the potential spread of the virus into insecure areas with limited access.

The national authorities, WHO and partners are working with communities to ensure that they understand and adopt Ebola prevention behaviours, including the need for safe and dignified burials. Healthcare workers have also been involved in improving infection prevention and control practices in health facilities. While all other components of the response, as well as preparedness and readiness in the non-affected provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the neighbouring countries are being undertaken.

[An impressive 8673 individuals have been vaccinated; but the remaining stock available is limited to 2750 doses. It is not clear how long it takes to build up the vaccine stock, but one hopes that is being done in anticipation of potential significant spread of the virus and/or the next outbreak. Since Ebola virus is enzootic in the country, and the practice of butchering bushmeat for consumption continues, one can expect periodic flare-ups of the virus in the human population. This is why instituting safe burial practices and other preventive practices is important for the current and future health of the communities. - Mod.LK]

[2] Hostility denounced
- Mon 17 Sep 2018. Hostility against Ebola response teams denounced by Beni civil society
[Radio Moto Butembo-Beni; in French, machine trans., edited]
http://radiomotofm.info/lirearticle.php?billet=4715

The civil society, Beni territorial coordination in North Kivu, condemns the attitude of resistance that some inhabitants of this territory face against the Ebola virus response teams. Muhindo Musubao Kiwanza, 2nd vice-president of this structure, told the press in Mangina since Thu 13 Sep 2018. He calls on the population to help experts in the eradication of the deadly disease.

According to him, some residents continue to be very hostile to government partners who have engaged in the Ebola response in the region. This behavior is displayed during sensitization or in the event of a death in the Ebola community.

This 2nd personality of the living forces in the territory of Beni lamented the attitude that was displayed last [Tue 10 Sep 2018] the population of Visiki, a village located more or less 40 km [about 25 mi] south of Mangina in the health zone of Mabalako, in the territory of Beni. The villagers of this part had thrown stones at the vehicles of a team of the commission of sensitization and communication.

While discouraging this uncivil behavior, Musubao Kiwanza asks the population to accept the intervention of the response teams to fight this dangerous epidemic.

It should be noted that a private health post in Beni-Ndindi had been sealed and its materials incinerated on 25 Aug 2018, following the death of an Ebola patient in its facilities. The population was dissatisfied with this measure of the Ministry of Health which, according to her, led to lack of local care. This position has been reopened and equipped this week to the satisfaction of the care recipients, who promised collaboration with the response team.

[3] CDC travel alerts
- Mon 17 Sep 2018. Democratic Republic of Congo: CDC travel alerts include Ebola, measles, polio
[Precision Vaccinations, edited]
https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/democratic-republic-congo-cdc-travel-alerts-include-ebola-measles-polio
[Byline: Don Ward Hackett]

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is confronting 5 outbreaks of infectious diseases at the same time.

To increase international traveler awareness of these disease outbreaks, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued separate 3 travel alerts for Ebola, measles, and polio on 14 Sep 2018.

Additionally, the CDC is cautioning DRC visitors to ongoing yellow fever and Zika viruses.

These CDC level 1 and 2 travel alerts mean visitors to the DRC should speak with a doctor, nurse, or pharmacist before traveling to learn if you are up to date with the required vaccinations, whether you need a booster dose and if you should bring medicines with you.

CDC travel alerts
-----------------
- Ebola: The DRC reported 5 additional confirmed Ebola cases and is now reporting a total of 106 confirmed, 31 probable cases, and 92 related deaths.
- Measles: On 2 May 2018, the CDC said travelers to the DRC should make sure they are vaccinated against measles with the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine.
- Polio: Since July 2017, the CDC reported vaccine-derived polio cases in both Haut-Lomami and Maniema provinces of the DRC.
- Yellow fever: The CDC said on during March 2018 that arriving travelers to the DRC should be vaccinated for yellow fever virus.
- Zika: The CDC updated its Zika alert for the DRC on 17 Aug 2018, saying pregnant women should not travel to the DRC.

The CDC says vaccinations offer the best protection from most infectious diseases.

International travelers can easily request a vaccination appointment with a pharmacy at Vax-Before-Travel.

[It is easy to forget about the other medically important diseases afflicting people during an outbreak, yet they do not disappear, but rather may be exacerbated by suspension of vaccination (measles, polio, yellow fever), fear of going to clinics where Ebola patients may be present, and general focus of attention. Patients with other infectious diseases and chronic conditions still need to be seen in the clinics and treated. This is no doubt a challenge in the midst of an outbreak of a disease as severe as Ebola where each patient requires so much care. - Mod.LK
