Deadly wild salmon disease found in River Spey fish
---------------------------------------------------
A disease that devastated wild salmon in Scottish rivers in the 1970s has been found in a fish taken from the River Spey, BBC Scotland has learned.

Officials said it was not yet known how infectious this particular strain of Ulcerative Dermal Necrosis (UDN) was.

UDN is a naturally occurring dermatological disease that leaves salmon with lesions, which can become infected.

Anglers visiting the Spey have been urged to disinfect their equipment.

The Spey River Board said many anglers and ghillies had reported salmon entering the river this season with lesions and ulcers on their head.

Samples taken by inspectors from the Marine Laboratory in Aberdeen confirmed 1 of the fish was suffering from UDN.

The Association of Salmon Boards has alerted river authorities across Scotland.

In a letter to proprietors on the river, the Spey River Board said deaths from UDN tended to come as a result of a secondary fungal infection with _Saprolegnia_.

The letter said: "The disease can affect sea trout and brown trout but juvenile fish do not appear susceptible.

"Previous outbreaks have died out naturally after a period of time. It is important to note that fish affected by UDN can and do survive to spawn normally.

"As an interim measure it is recommended that all fresh run fish exhibiting head lesions, but otherwise free of fungal infection should be returned in the hope that they will recover and spawn naturally."

There have been two serious outbreaks of UDN in Scotland, one in the 1880s and another in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

[UDN is predominantly a condition of the head skin of salmonid fish native to the waters of the British Isles. It has, however, occurred in the Baltic, northwest France and possibly elsewhere. It has never been reported in farmed fish. It was first reported in the 19th century. It probably occurred prior to 1868 but the main epizootic was in 1877 when it was referred to as Salmon Disease.

The disease largely disappeared until the mid 1960s when it first occurred in southwest Ireland and then gradually spread to almost all rivers of the British Isles and subbsequently to neighbouring areas. It had disappeared again by the mid 1970s. Salmon (_Salmo salar_) and sea trout (_Salmo trutta_) are susceptible and there is evidence that some brown trout may also show clinical signs. The disease is characteristically found in adult wild fish as they congregate at sea prior to entering fresh water and during their upstream river migration.

The lesion is a progressive cytolytic necrosis of epidermal Malpighian cells, of the pemphigoid type which is restricted to specific sites on the head. On entry to fresh water, these rapidly ulcerate and may become infected with a number of opportunistic pathogens, principal of which is the oomycete _Saprolegnia diclina_. Once this occurs the lesion extends by fungal activity, death being due either to secondary bacterial infection of the ulcer or, more often, circulatory failure resulting from the osmotic hemodilution induced by the large area of ulceration. The condition is primarily found in the colder months of the year and usually persists at a high for 3 or 4 years in a river system after which it gradually disappears.

Attempts to isolate a specific viral or bacterial agent from the lesions, or from other organs, have failed and the evidence that is an infectious disease is very limited. Investigation into other more complex possible etiologies have been equally unsuccessful.

The characteristic early lesion, the pemphigoid bulla has, however, also been induced by photosensitization, and this may represent a further possibility for its investigation. Currently the disease is in a period of remission and no outbreaks had been reported for some years. It may be no coincidence that the incidence of outbreaks has appeared always to coincide with very high wild salmonid stock levels.

Recent studies suggest that the pathophysiological mechanism of UDN impact is connected with a decrease in the most important antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase) and total antioxidant activity of muscles, liver, and heart (Bulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Puławy 53: 813-818).
