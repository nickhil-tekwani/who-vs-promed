First West Nile Virus-positive Horse in Virginia; 67th in USA
-------------------------------------------------------------
The USDA National Veterinary Services laboratory in Ames, Iowa has
confirmed that a serum sample from a horse submitted for testing by the
Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) is
positive for West Nile virus (WNV). The horse, a 6-year-old Standard-bred
Gelding, is from Rockingham County and was referred to the state Regional
Animal Health Laboratory System for testing. Clinical symptoms included a
drooping lip, muzzle deviation, and ataxia or stumbling. The horse is still
alive and his condition is improving, although he continues to stumble.
WNV first appeared in the United States in 1999 in New York City. There
were 88 confirmed clinical cases of WNV in horses during the year 2000 in
New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Pennsylvania, and Delaware. So far in 2001, Louisiana, Kentucky, New York,
Connecticut, and Florida have reported 66 confirmed cases. This case, the
67th, is the first confirmed case in a horse in Virginia.
In 1999 and 2000, roughly 40 percent of the horses with confirmed WNV
infections either died or were euthanized because of the severity of their
condition. Unlike some other encephalitis viruses such as Eastern Equine
Encephalitis (EEE), horses that live through the 2 to 3 weeks of WNV
infection generally recover fully with no long-term side effects. Many
other horse diseases may look like WNV, including rabies, EEE, Moldy Corn
Poisoning, and Equine Protozoal Myelitis, so horse owners should always
call a licensed veterinarian to examine any animal with signs of neurologic
problems. Currently, there are live-animal tests for WNV in horses and
chickens, but none for other animals, although testing can be done on any
dead animal.

have yet been detected in Virginia. - Mod.CP
