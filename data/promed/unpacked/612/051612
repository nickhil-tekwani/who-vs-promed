Hong Kong health authorities are investigating a case of rat hepatitis E virus involving a 55-year-old man who was infected by an undetermined source. The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) revealed on Friday [13 May 2022] that the patient, who lives in Tai Po, was already receiving treatment at Prince of Wales Hospital for underlying illnesses when medical workers discovered he had deranged liver function. The man's blood sample tested positive for the virus strain, but he remains in stable condition. He did not have contact with rats or other rodents and had no recent travel history.

"Based on the available epidemiological information, the source and the route of infection could not be determined. The CHP's investigation is ongoing," a spokesman for the centre said. Health authorities will also carry out rodent control measures and a survey in the area.

The exact mode of transmission of rat hepatitis E virus to humans remains unknown, with the CHP saying possible routes included consumption of food that had come into contact with rodents or their excreta, as well as exposure to contaminated environments.

The hepatitis E virus that usually causes human infection is transmitted mainly through the fecal-oral route.

Abstract
--------
"Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) variants belonging to _Orthohepevirus_ species A (HEV-A) are the primary cause of human hepatitis E. However, we previously reported that _Orthohepevirus_ species C genotype 1 (HEV-C1), a divergent HEV variant commonly found in rats, also causes hepatitis in humans. Here, we present a clinical-epidemiological investigation of human HEV-C1 infections detected in Hong Kong, with an emphasis on outcomes in immunocompromised individuals.

"Methods: A surveillance system for detecting human HEV-C1 infections was established in Hong Kong. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HEV-C1 cases identified via this system between 1 Aug 2019 and 31 Dec 2020 were retrieved. Phylogenetic analysis of HEV-C1 strain sequences was performed. Infection outcomes of immunocompromised individuals with HEV-A and HEV-C1 infections were analyzed.

"Results: HEV-C1 accounted for 8 of 53 (15.1%) reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed HEV infections in Hong Kong during the study period, raising the total number of HEV-C1 infections detected in the city to 16. Two distinct HEV-C1 strain groups caused human infections. Patients were elderly and/or immunocompromised; half tested negative for HEV immunoglobulin M. Cumulatively, HEV-C1 accounted for 9 of 21 (42.9%) cases of hepatitis E recorded in immunocompromised patients in Hong Kong. Immunocompromised HEV-C1 patients progressed to persistent hepatitis at similar rates (7/9 [77.8%]) as HEV-A patients (10/12 [75%]). HEV-C1 patients responded to oral ribavirin, although the response to the 1st course was sometimes poor or delayed.

"Conclusions: Dedicated RT-PCR-based surveillance detected human HEV-C1 cases that evade conventional hepatitis E diagnostic testing. Immunosuppressed HEV-C1-infected patients frequently progress to persistent HEV-C1 infection, for which ribavirin is a suitable treatment option."

Additionally, a case was reported from Canada in 2019:

Andonov A, Robbins M, Borlang J, et al. Rat hepatitis E virus linked to severe acute hepatitis in an immunocompetent patient. J Infect Dis. 2019; 220(6): 951-955; https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiz025/5288497.

A case was also reported in Spain:

Rivero-Juarez A, Frias M, Perez A B, et al. _Orthohepevirus_ C infection as an emerging cause of acute hepatitis in Spain: 1st report in Europe. J Hepatol. 2022; S0168-8278(22)00075-7; https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(22)00075-7/fulltext.

It is important to know that diagnostic testing for this virus, now reported in Europe and North America after 1st characterized in Hong Kong, can be problematic. - Mod.LL
