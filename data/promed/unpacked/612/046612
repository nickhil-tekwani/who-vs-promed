Two elk have tested positive for brucellosis in the Bighorn Mountains. However, no cattle in the same area have been found with the disease. State veterinarian Jim Logan is recommending a risk assessment of livestock and advised area livestock producers to conduct voluntary surveillance for brucellosis.

Elk arrive in the Bighorns from different locations, so Logan said he doesn't know how extensive the infection is.

Tim Woolley, of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, tells the Powell Tribune that the elk with brucellosis could have come from Montana, the Absaroka Mountains, or from the Thermopolis area.

Woolley says Game and Fish wants to obtain more information before arriving at any conclusions.

[Wyoming has had its share of brucellosis issues in cervids, spilling over into cattle on occasion. Voluntary surveillance is a reasonable plan and prudent producers will heed the words.

Subscribers are encouraged to read the moderator's comments in ProMED-mail post 20130404.1622341 to gain a better understanding of brucellosis in cattle. The issue here is that the disease spills over into domestic livestock, which is what the comments address. - Mod.TG
