Vaccine Confirmed as Source of Polio Outbreak in Haiti/Dominican
Republic
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A recent outbreak of the paralyzing viral infection poliomyelitis in Haiti
and the Dominican Republic has been traced to a strain of oral polio
vaccine (OPV) that mutated back to virulence, according to
international health officials.

Based on genetic analysis of viral samples, they believe the outbreak,
which struck nearly 2 dozen children in both countries between 2000
and 2001 [see refs. above arose from OPV given to one child in 1998-
1999. Health officials had already cited the vaccine as the probable
source of the outbreak, but this new analysis now makes it
"unequivocally clear," research leader Dr. Olen Kew, of the US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, told
Reuters Health. Their findings were published Thursday in
Sciencexpress, the online edition of the journal Science
[see: Sciencexpress 2002;10.1126/science.1068284.

Poliovirus spreads from person to person, usually going unrecognized
because it produces mild symptoms or none at all. When it attacks
nerve cells, however, the infection can cause crippling, sometimes
deadly, disease. OPV contains a live, weakened polio virus that is very
effective at conferring immunity to the infection. But it can, in rare
cases, cause poliomyelitis. For this reason, countries such as the USA
now use only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is injected. OPV
continues to be the standard in developing countries, however, because
it is cheaper and easier to administer, doesn't require supplies of sterile
needles and is more effective than IPV at preventing outbreaks.

But the cases in Haiti and the Dominican Republic illustrate a potential
risk with OPV when it is given in a population where many people are
unvaccinated. After a person receives OPV, virus from the vaccine is
shed in the stools for a short period of time. In this outbreak, shed
virus from a single OPV dose spread and mutated back to a virulent
state, causing paralytic disease in a group of children who had either
not been vaccinated or had not received a complete course of OPV.
This same scenario has been blamed in a number of cases of paralytic
disease in Egypt and the Philippines. According to the researchers, one
of the critical factors in all of these outbreaks was the large number of
unvaccinated, vulnerable people in the population.

In fact, Kew explained, it is common for OPV strains to "back-mutate."
It only becomes a potential problem in populations with low
vaccination rates, which lack a "wall of immunity." He said the findings
underscore the importance of improving vaccine coverage in areas
such as Hispaniola, the island that comprises Haiti and the Dominican
Republic. They also emphasize the need to eradicate wild-type
poliovirus "as soon as possible," Kew and his colleagues note. If
eradication happens, public health officials could phase out the use of
OPV, in favor of IPV. Officials are currently trying to develop an "end-
game strategy" for going about this, said the CDC's Dr. Mark Pallansch,
a co-author on the study. However, he noted, an "emergency stockpile"
of OPV would be kept on hand in the event of a polio outbreak.

[Readers are referred to the Sciencexpress article referenced above
2002;10.1126/science.1068284
<http://www.sciencemag.org/sciencexpress/recent.shtml>.
Through the use of nucleotide sequencing Kew et al were able to
demonstrate that the viruses responsible for the paralytic poliomyelitis
outbreak in the Dominican Republic and Haiti were derivatives from an
attenuated poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in use during 1998-1999. The
reversion of the vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV) to a virus with
neurovirulence that was able to circulate and lead to an epidemic of
paralytic disease in an under-vaccinated population raises significant
concerns for the future in terms of continued use of the attenuated
poliovirus vaccine in areas where wild virus is no longer circulating.

In the article above, Kew is mentioned as saying that it is common for
vaccine viruses to "back mutate" (revert to wild poliovirus-like
neurovirulence), but the concerns arise in areas with low vaccination
coverage and therefore low herd immunity, so that these reverted
viruses are in an environment favorable for circulation and propagation
of an outbreak of paralytic disease. As OPV has been in use since
1960, one wonders if this is a new occurrence or just a new recognition
of the problem. In the USA in the 70s, vaccination coverages with
OPV had fallen below the 80% rate in many areas (presumed to be due
to complacency rather than a strong objection to vaccination), while
background wild poliovirus circulation had been interrupted. Is the
cut-off point for vaccination coverage which will support this
occurrence much lower than that necessary to interrupt transmission of
wild virus? What are the implications for the polio eradication efforts
in regions that have interrupted circulation of the wild virus and have
been declared as polio free, and therefore are no longer doing national
immunization days (NIDs)? Can these countries sustain vaccination
coverages high enough to prevent this occurrence? And what are the
cost implications of this "emerging" infectious disease problem?
