New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 2
Outbreak 1: Chathman-Kent, Ontario
Date of start of the outbreak: 7 Aug 2015
Outbreak status: Resolved (2 sep 2015)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 42 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 1
Affected population: Beef cattle production

Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 7.14 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Sporadic incursions of bluetongue have occurred in the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia in the past. This is the 1st occurrence of bluetongue serotype 13 in Canada, and the 1st occurrence of bluetongue outside the Okanagan Valley. Confirmation of this outbreak is based on serology only and is reported in compliance with Chapter 8.3.1.3 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code. The index animal was detected at slaughter by the national Bovine Serological Surveillance System. Two more seropositive animals were identified through on-farm investigation and testing. No clinical signs were observed in any of the 3 animals. PCR negative results are supportive of a past infection. Because these animals have never left the farm of origin, we conclude that transmission of bluetongue virus has occurred in Ontario for the 1st time. Bluetongue virus serotype 13 is endemic to the United States of America. The affected beef cattle farm is located in Southwestern Ontario, within 100 km of the border with the United States of America. Canada does not implement control measures for bluetongue serotypes 2, 10, 11, 13 and 17. These serotypes are considered endemic in the United States of America.

Control measures
Measures applied: Vaccination prohibited, No treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (National laboratory) / Cattle / antibody detection ELISA / 28 Aug 2015 / Positive

National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (National laboratory) / Cattle / polymersase chain reaction (PCR) / 2 Sep 2015 / Negative

National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (National laboratory) / Cattle / seroneutralization tset (SNT) / 2 Sep 2015 / Positive

Future Reporting: The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[The following information was obtained from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's fact sheet on bluetongue, update on 3 Sep 2015, available at http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/bluetongue/fact-sheet/eng/1306116803992/1306121522520:

"Bluetongue can be found anywhere the midges that transmit the virus are present. It is commonly found in the U.S., Mexico, Australia, Africa, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent and China. Bluetongue is also spreading northwards in Europe.

Most of Canada is currently free of the disease.

Over the past 30 years, there have been occurrences of bluetongue in the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia, which are believed to be the result of wind-borne introduction of infected midges from the U.S. In September 2015, bluetongue was confirmed in southwestern Ontario.

The types of bluetongue considered endemic in the U.S. (serotypes 2, 10, 11, 13 and 17) are immediately notifiable under the Health of Animals Regulations. Laboratories are required to report confirmed diagnoses to the CFIA. This enables prevalence verification and supports international reporting and certification requirements.

All remaining types of bluetongue, exotic to the U.S., are federally reportable under the Health of Animals Act. This means that all suspected or confirmed cases must be reported to the CFIA for immediate investigation by veterinary inspectors.

Should an exotic type of bluetongue occur in Canada, the CFIA would respond in order to limit the impact of the disease to the geographic zone in which the disease is found. The exact nature of the response would depend on a number of factors including the ability of the midges to exist and thrive in the season, and the zone where the outbreak is occurring.

There is no risk to human health associated with bluetongue." - Mod.CRD
