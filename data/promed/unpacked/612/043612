Here's a not so surprising piece of medical news from a country where
scarce health resources have been diverted to fuel the DR Congo's
war against rebels in the east of the country.

Some 261 new cases of trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) were diagnosed
from a sample of 4615 persons who were examined in Kinshasa last month [Jan
1999, an infection rate of six percent.
The central office of the anti-trypanosomiasis programme said that the
infection rate was two percent last November when 118 new cases were
detected from a sample of 6045 people who were tested [2%.
The upsurge in sleeping sickness cases is not only exerting pressure on
health centres but on the staff as well. A news release issued by the
Kinshasa office of the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that while
"African human trypanosomiasis" is common in Kinshasa's western periphery
zones, there were fears the disease, caused [sic by tsetse flies, could
also spread to residential areas around N'djili international airport.
[African trypanosomiasis is caused by the trypanosome, a single-celled
parasite. It is transmitted by the bite of tsetse flies - Mod.JW
The trypanosomiasis office, several non-governmental organisations and the
Belgian cooperation office have joined hands to combat the disease.
