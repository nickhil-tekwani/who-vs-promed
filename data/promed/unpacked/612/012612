Measles re-emerged in some counties in Germany in 2005, despite increasing
vaccination coverage rates in children at school entry in recent years,
which had led to decreasing incidences (with the lowest incidence ever
recorded, 0.2 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in 2004). Regional outbreaks
have been detected by the mandatory reporting system in the states of Hesse
and Bavaria. Although both outbreaks led to similar incidences in the
affected areas (14 and 12 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, respectively) they
differed in age distribution, transmission patterns, and measles virus
genotype. In Hesse, 223 cases were submitted, from which 160 belonged to 41
clusters mainly defined by family or household contacts. Attack rate was
highest in children aged 1-4 years (102 cases per 100 000). Results of
measles virus diagnosis showed genotype D4 and identical nucleotide
sequences for all analysed cases from Hesse. In Bavaria, 279 cases were
submitted, most of which had occurred in schools and preschool facilities.
Age-specific attack rate was highest in children aged 5-9 years (129/100
000). Laboratory diagnosed viruses were identified as genotype D6 and were
identical at the nucleotide level. In both outbreaks the vast majority of
cases (95 per cent in Hesse and 98 per cent in Bavaria) were in
unvaccinated children, but vaccination coverage differed in the affected
areas and was slightly lower in Bavaria than in Hesse. Local accumulation
of unvaccinated children and their concentration in schools and
kindergarten preceded the outbreak in Bavaria. Despite high average
vaccination coverage levels, local variations may lead to regionally
limited outbreaks.
Introduction
------------
In Germany, 2 doses of MMR vaccine have been recommended since 1991. The
current schedule has been in place since 2001, and recommends that the
first dose is given at age 11 to 14 months and the 2nd dose at age 15 to 23
months. Vaccination is mainly done by private physicians. Vaccination
coverage and measles control remain regionally different in the federal
states. Nationwide measles surveillance started in 1999 with a sentinel
group of paediatricians and general practitioners (GPs), which was kept in
place when statutory reporting was introduced by law in 2001. Case reports
in both systems are made according to the clinical case definition.
Laboratory testing of suspected measles is mostly offered and carried out
in a decentralised fashion by private laboratories. However, the National
Reference Centre for Measles, Mumps and Rubella (NRC MMR) at the Robert
Koch-Institut (RKI) plays a major role particularly in genotyping of
measles viruses (MVs).
The epidemiological situation has changed in recent years. Until 2002
endemic circulation and regional outbreaks of measles were observed by
sentinel and mandatory surveillance in the western part of the country
[1,2]. Only sporadic cases occurred in the eastern part (territory of the
former German Democratic Republic) due to higher vaccination coverage
[1,2]. Since 2003, the incidence of reported cases nationwide has dropped
below 1 per 100 000 inhabitants [3]. Vaccination coverage registered at
school entry has steadily increased from 89 per cent and 15 per cent (for
the 1st and 2nd dose, respectively) in 1998 to 94 per cent and 66 per cent
in 2004. However, there are differences in vaccination coverage at regional
and local levels. At the beginning of 2005, 2 measles outbreaks were
detected by the surveillance system in counties of the federal states of
Hesse and Bavaria. In this report both outbreaks are described including
genetic analysis of the detected MVs in order to illustrate how and why
regionally limited outbreaks may still occur.
Methods
-------
Both outbreaks were detected by the mandatory reporting system which is
based on the Protection Against Infection law ("Infektionsschutzgesetz")
[4]. According to this law, physicians must report every suspected measles
case, and laboratories must report every confirmed measles case, to the
local health department. At the local level, which consists of 431 county
health departments nationwide, reports are checked to see whether they fit
the case definition, whether clinical and laboratory reports may be linked,
and whether further cases have occurred which have not been reported yet.
Case data are electronically submitted to the health departments of
Germany's 16 federal states and from there to the RKI. Cases are listed
according to the reporting week, which is given by data entry at local level.
Each measles case submitted must meet one of the 3 following diagnostic
categories:
- clinically diagnosed case: fever and rash and at least one of the
symptoms cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, Koplik spots
- clinically and laboratory confirmed case: clinically diagnosed case with
laboratory confirmation
- clinically and epidemiologically confirmed case: clinically diagnosed
case without laboratory confirmation but with an epidemiological link to a
laboratory confirmed case.
In the following report a case is defined as any submitted case, regardless
of diagnostic category, unless another explanation is given.
Local health authorities carried out outbreak investigations by
interviewing physicians and family members in order to detect further cases
and contacts. In order to stop transmission, they began campaigns in
schools and kindergartens, aimed at informing parents and getting
susceptible children vaccinated by their family physicians. After detection
of the first contact cases, the federal health authorities, together with
the NRC MMR, encouraged public health officials and physicians in the
affected areas to carry out laboratory investigations. Tests were carried
out in local private laboratories and in the NRC MMR. Local laboratories
generally test sera for measles specific IgM and IgG antibodies by
commercially available enzyme immunoassays. Information on the total number
of tested but not confirmed suspected measles cases is available only from
the NRC MMR.
In the NRC MMR antibody tests were carried out as well as detection ofMV
RNA in clinical samples (throat swabs, urine and oral fluid) by RT-PCR, as
described previously [5]. In order to trace the transmission pathways of
the virus, samples from 38 cases were genetically characterised by sequence
analysis of the variable part of the N-gene (456 nt), as described
previously [6]. Assignment to measles virus genotypes was performed by
phylogenetic analysis as recommended by the World Health Organization [7].
Results
-------
(1) Outbreaks in Hesse: From January to May 2005, a total of 223 cases were
reported from 4 neighbouring counties (the cities of Offenbach, Frankfurt,
Wetterau and Giessen) and the nearby city of Wiesbaden accounting for an
incidence of 14 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in this area. During the same
period, a further 29 sporadic cases were reported from 11 counties of
Hesse, but 10 counties of this federal state had no measles cases.
Age-specific attack rates were highest in children aged 1-4 years (102/100
000), followed by those aged 5-9 years (83/100 000) (illustrated by a
figure in the original text). Although the incidence in adults was only
about 2 per 100 000, the rate of admission to hospital was 34 per cent in
patients aged 20 years and older. A 14 year old girl died. The vast
majority (209; 95 per cent) of cases were in unvaccinated people.
The first clusters of measles cases were reported in the cities of
Offenbach and Frankfurt, mainly in families considered to be hard to reach
by the health services. A case report of a hospitalised patient in January
[2005] led the public health authorities to identify further patients with
cases which fit the clinical case definition but who had not seen a
physician. Of the cases reported in January 2005, 19 had experienced onset
of disease in 2004. Measles cases were next reported from the adjacent
county of Wetterau, where several families were affected, followed by
reports from the county of Giessen and finally from the city of Wiesbaden
(illustrated by a figure in the original text).
In all, 160 cases from the 5 counties were scattered in 41 clusters with
clinically and epidemiologically confirmed cases, mainly defined by family
or household contacts. Despite interviews with patients, parents and other
carers and guardians, and physicians, no connections between the clusters
themselves or between the clusters and the remaining single cases were
detected. A diagnosis of measles was laboratory confirmed in 67 cases. The
NRC MMR obtained samples from 29 suspected measles cases in the state of
Hesse and confirmed measles diagnosis in 18 cases, all of which were
distributed in the 5 counties affected by the outbreak. Results of MV
genotyping available for 12 patients from Hesse showed that these cases
were exclusively caused by MVs of the same genotype D4. Moreover, these MVs
also showed identical nucleotide sequences and thus belonged to a
homogeneous genetic group.
(2) Outbreak in Bavaria: From March to July, 279 cases were submitted from
8 counties in the south of Bavaria, in and around the city of Munich,
leading to an incidence of 12/100 000 inhabitants in the region
[illustrated by a figure in the original text]. During the same period, 25
sporadic cases were submitted from 13 further Bavarian counties. No cases
of measles were reported in the remaining 75 counties. The outbreak mainly
affected school-aged children (5-14 years old) (208; 74 per cent) but about
12 per cent of cases (16) were in adolescents and adults, and 7 out of 11
hospitalised cases were in patients aged 20 years or older. Age-specific
incidence was highest in children aged between 5 and 9 years (129/100 000
children), followed by those aged between 10 and 14 years (58/100 000).
As the attack rates indicate, most of the cases were related to outbreaks
in schools or preschool facilities: 45 cases occurred in a primary school
in Munich, 52 cases in children from several counties who attended the same
Montessori school, 42 cases in children in 4 kindergartens, and 38 cases in
4 further schools in different communities. Investigations of the local
health authorities showed possible transmission between these outbreak
settings. This was also confirmed by laboratory results.
Of the reported outbreak cases, 70 were laboratory confirmed, 26 of these
were tested in the NRC MMR, and MVs from 17 cases representing all local
clusters were genotyped. All of these viruses were identified as genotype
D6 and were identical at the nucleotide level. This indicates the presence
of the same chain of transmission of a D6 virus within the Bavarian
outbreak. Most of the cases (273; 98 per cent) were in unvaccinated people,
including 8 children who were initially reported as vaccinated, but vaccine
had been given during the incubation period, which was too late to prevent
the disease. The genetic identification of 4 of these cases revealed
measles wild-type virus (D6). In 6 cases, vaccination status remained unknown.
One measles case in Austria could be traced to the Bavarian outbreak, but
no information on the genotype was available.
Discussion
----------
Although vaccination coverage seemed to be high on average, regional
outbreaks still occurred. In the affected region in Hesse, vaccination
coverage at school entry is on the same level as the nationwide average
proportion: 95 percent and 65 per cent for the 1st and 2nd dose,
respectively. This might explain why most of the cases observed where
either single cases or part of small clusters. Virus circulation was
ultimately limited because vaccinated people were well protected and this
led to the interruption of the transmission chain. The age distribution of
the cases in Hesse and the peak at age 1-4 years suggest that vaccination
is not given at the recommended age which was below 2 years of age for 2
doses. Some of the affected families were part of a particular community
where most families had several children, avoided seeking medical care, are
difficult for health care services to reach, and do not bring their babies
to health care services for routine checkups. Missing vaccinations for the
children of such families are usually detected and given later in childhood
(for instance at medical examination before school entry), leaving the very
young unprotected, and therefore susceptible children may accumulate. In
addition, coverage of the 2nd dose of vaccine is generally still too low to
make up for primary vaccine failures and to use the early 2nd chance to be
effectively immunised. Unfortunately, vaccine coverage data by age are not
available. The registration of coverage at school entry is too late to
assess whether children were immunised appropriate to age and to identify
target groups for catch up vaccination.
Vaccination coverage in Hesse is slightly higher than in Bavaria (91 per
cent and 59 per cent for the 1st and 2nd doses, respectively) and,
moreover, there are great regional and local differences in vaccination
coverage in Bavaria. In the affected Bavarian counties, coverage is below
the Bavarian average (personal communication, Dr Hautmann, Bavarian
Landesamt fuer Gesundheit und Lebensmittelsicherheit). This may explain why
it took a longer time for a similar number of people to be infected in a
smaller area in Hesse in comparison to Bavaria. However, the older age of
the Bavarian measles patients demonstrated that clusters of unvaccinated
people may benefit from herd immunity until the virus arrives. Public
health authorities had observed a concentration of unvaccinated children in
single communities and certain schools and childcare facilities (most of
which had connections with the anthroposophic teachings of Rudolf Steiner)
in the outbreak areas in advance but their vaccination recommendations,
although publicised in local newspapers and handouts to parents and carers
in schools and kindergartens, were apparently ignored. This might have led
to the accumulation of measles-susceptible people and the rapid spread of
infection.
The virus of the observed transmission chain in Hesse differs from the
previously detected D4 viruses. No identical nucleotide sequence could be
found in the published data so far.
Interestingly, the NRC MMR as the WHO regional reference laboratory had
investigated clinical material from 8 cases belonging to a measles outbreak
in Romania in the 4th quarter of 2004. The detected D4 MVs share the
nucleotide sequence with the D4 viruses which emerged in Hesse in the 1st
quarter of 2005 and in Berlin in the 2nd quarter of the same year
(illustrated by a figure in the original text)]. Therefore, it can be
assumed that the detected D4 MVs in Germany were possibly imported from
Romania. This assumption is supported by the public health authorities in
Hesse, who informed about possible contacts of cases in Hesse to Romania.
The genotype D6 MVs in Bavaria share their sequence with those of 4 measles
cases from Switzerland also investigated at the NRC MMR, which occurred in
the 1st quarter of 2005. Moreover, the only case confirmed by the NRC MMR
in 2004 (2nd quarter, federal state of North-Rhine-Westphalia) belonged to
the same variant of genotype D6. During the 1990s, MVs of genotype D6 were
not only endemically circulating in Germany but also widely distributed
throughout Europe [6,8-11). Furthermore, sequence data published in the
GenBank indicate that the same genetic variant of D6 was also circulating
in several regions of Russia in 2003 and 2004. Therefore, the appearance of
a D6virus in Bavaria might be due to a continued limited circulation of
this genotype in central Europe or might likewise be caused by virus
importation.
Conclusion
----------
The mandatory reporting system already in place enabled health authorities
and epidemiologists at all levels of public health to detect and combat
outbreaks of measles. Laboratory investigation plays an important role in
measles surveillance and control, and is particularly indispensable for
tracing transmission chains in outbreaks. Genetic characterisation of the
detected viruses revealed that the outbreaks in Hesse and Bavaria were
associated with distinct MV genotypes. These data demonstrate that both
outbreaks were caused by independent transmission chains of the MV. While
the outbreak in Hesse was possibly due to imported measles, the origin of
the Bavarian outbreak could be either imported or indigenous. Besides the
different MV genotypes, the spread of infection also appeared to be
different in both outbreaks. While in Hesse, frequent small clusters and
single cases were observed in outbreak settings such as families and
households, in Bavaria it was mainly childcare facilities where measles
susceptible children were concentrated that were affected. It can be
assumed that although vaccine coverage was high at average, regional and
local variations in vaccination coverage lead to distinct epidemiological
situations.
In the 2 outbreaks, 2 different groups of 'hard-to-reach' populations were
involved: people who did not generally seek medical care, and people who
are selective about the medical services they use and often refuse
vaccination, especially for measles. Special attention should therefore be
given to identifying target groups and to find appropriate ways to reach
them by additional immunisation initiatives. This includes assessment of
vaccination coverage at an earlier age. Generally, coverage of the second
dose of measles vaccine still needs to be improved at all local, regional
and nationwide levels.
The outbreaks provide evidence that, despite the decline in measles
incidence in Germany due to increased vaccination coverage and improved
measles surveillance in recent years, the potential for local outbreaks is
still present, and measles control and vaccination awareness should be
continued and improved at all levels.

Dear Mod.MPP, you recently commented:
"In the past few years, we have been reminded very clearly that we live in
a global village with respect to disease transmission."
What worries me especially about this measles outbreak is the upcoming
Soccer Championship [Association Football World Cup] in Germany with
several hundred thousand international young adults of questionable immune
status flocking to the stadiums in "droplet distance". Working in the field
of Travel Medicine, I always talk about malaria and yellow fever elsewhere.
Now, reversing this viewpoint, we must recommend the international (soccer)
community: check your measles shots before you come over.
Welcome anyway!!
