The _Culex modestus_ mosquito, which can carry the dreaded West Nile virus [WNV], has been found in Denmark for the 1st time. The mosquito, which can transmit the Usutu virus from birds to humans, was found in a waterhole near a residential neighbourhood in the south western Copenhagen suburb of Greve.

"The mosquito itself is harmless," Rene Bodker, an epidemiologist from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), told DR Nyheder. "It 1st becomes dangerous when birds migrating from the south arrive here carrying the virus. The mosquito doesn't distinguish whether it's biting birds or people, and it bites during the day and night."

Warmer weather is bringing it north. It is the 1st time that the West Nile [virus] mosquito [vector] has been found so far north in Europe. There are no vaccines to protect humans from the Usutu virus or the West Nile virus, which killed some 50 people during an epidemic in Russia and Romania in the 1990s. It has killed some 1500 people in the US since 1st being found there in 1999.

DTU, which has been monitoring mosquito populations nationwide in Denmark since 2011, only found the "West Nile mosquito" in that one waterhole in Greve and blamed climate change for the mosquitoes being so far north. The mosquito has gone now as winter approaches, but another warm summer could bring it back.

"Our research showed that people at the beach in Greve were attacked by West-Nile mosquitoes more than once a minute in August 2014," Bodker said in a press release.

The species arrived to the south of London in 2010, and it now makes up 90 per cent of all mosquitoes found in the sand dunes in Kent.

[_Culex modestus_ is one of the main WNV vectors in Europe and has been shown to be a more efficient vector than _Cx. pipiens_ in the laboratory. It feeds on birds, horses and humans. The risk of permanent populations becoming established in Denmark is not known and will likely depend on its ability to survive the winter.

WNV is endemic in the Mediterranean Basin and into southern Central Europe and into Russia. Concern about expansion of the WNV range into northern Europe and the UK, where this mosquito has been found also, is justified and warrants continued surveillance of both vectors and the virus.
