In Kamrup (metro), 23 individuals have been diagnosed with acute
encephalitis syndrome (AES), and only 3 patients had tested positive
for Japanese encephalitis. The number of patients diagnosed with AES
and Japanese encephalitis in the Kamrup district stands at 15 and 9,
respectively. The sources said the majority of the cases pertained to
AES and only a few among them had tested positive for Japanese
encephalitis.

"As soon as suspected cases of AES come to light, blood samples of the
patients are collected and sent for testing at the GMCH laboratory to
ascertain whether they are actually affected by the Japanese
encephalitis virus. However, doctors start symptomatic treatment as
soon as a suspected case is brought in," the joint director of Kamrup
(metro) health services, A. Bhuyan, said. In the GMCH alone, over 30
individuals suffering from AES and Japanese encephalitis are
undergoing treatment. While the conditions of patients with AES are
said to be out of danger, the condition of a few patients suffering
from Japanese encephalitis continues to be critical. A few individuals
are also admitted to other private nursing homes in the city.

"There is no specific medicine for Japanese encephalitis, and patients
are administered only symptomatic treatment. While some patients
suffering from AES and Japanese encephalitis have recovered following
treatment, a few with Japanese encephalitis continue to be critical
and have not shown much sign of improvement. We are constantly
monitoring them," a senior doctor at GMCH said.

The Japanese encephalitis virus is found in wild birds and pigs and is
transmitted to humans through the bite of _Culex_ mosquitoes. The
symptoms usually occur in the form of prolonged high fever, severe
headache, nausea and constriction in muscle movement.

[Curiously, the previous report of 25 Jul 2011 (ProMED-mail archive
no. 20110725.2245) identified all the encephalitis cases in Assam
state as due to Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus infection, with no
mention made of the "acute encephalitis syndrome" (AES) of unknown
etiology. The above report indicates that only a relatively small
proportion of the Assam encephalitis cases are due to JE virus
infection. The etiologies of the AES cases remain undetermined; no
mention is made in the above report of attempts to determine their
cause. All of the control and prevention efforts are aimed at JE
virus.
