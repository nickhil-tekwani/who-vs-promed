2 North Darfur localities housing more than 60 000 displaced persons for almost 6 months are facing an outbreak of hepatitis E, with 170 cases diagnosed recently, Unamid [African Union/UN Hybrid operation in Darfur] said in a statement.

The localities of Saraf Omra and Al Sareif Beni Hussein have received thousands of people fleeing deadly clashes between the Abbala and Beni Hussein tribes that erupted in January 2013 over control of the Jebel-Amer gold mine. The UN estimates that more than 100 000 people were displaced as a result.

On Wednesday [22 May 2013], Unamid and the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that they airlifted more than 1.5 tons of medical supplies to civilians in the 2 localities. The supplies were transferred to medical facilities, Unamid declared.

The mission also announced that, together with the African Union, it signed an agreement to provide nearly USD 3 million (originally part of a USD 10 million Japanese government donation) for a variety of humanitarian, development and peace-building projects in Darfur.

The funds will be administered by the Trust Fund for the Support of Lasting Peace in Darfur.

[North Darfur occupies more than half of the territory of the Darfur region, and includes part of the Marrah Mountains (Jebel Marra). The northern part is entirely desert. To the south, there is slightly more rainfall with the eastern side being plains with low sandy hills, while the volcanic Marrah Mountains occupy most of the western side of the south. In the southern portion, the most important crops are millet, maize and peanuts. The area has been afflicted by civil strife over many years. Hepatitis E virus infection is prevalent throughout both Sudan and South Sudan.

Hepatitis E virus is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water. It is usually a self-limiting infection and resolves within 4-6 weeks. Occasionally, a fulminant form of hepatitis develops causing acute liver failure, which can lead to death. Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. Genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 70 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. The highest seroprevalence rates are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus.

The incubation period following exposure to the hepatitis E virus ranges from 3-8 weeks, with a mean of 40 days. The period of communicability is unknown. Hepatitis E virus causes acute sporadic and epidemic viral hepatitis. Symptomatic infection is most common in young adults aged 15-40 years. Although infection is frequent in children, the disease is mostly asymptomatic or causes a very mild illness without jaundice (anicteric) that goes undiagnosed. These symptoms are largely indistinguishable from those experienced during any acute phase of any hepatic illness and typically last for one to 2 weeks. In rare cases, acute hepatitis E can result in fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure) and death. Fulminant hepatitis occurs more frequently during pregnancy. Pregnant women are at greater risk of obstetrical complications and mortality from hepatitis E, which can induce a mortality rate of 20 percent among pregnant women in their 3rd trimester (see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html).

There is no specific treatment capable of altering the course of acute hepatitis. Prevention is the most effective approach against the disease. Fortunately, hepatitis E is usually self-limiting, except in the case of pregnant women.
