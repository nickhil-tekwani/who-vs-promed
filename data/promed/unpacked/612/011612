Dear Dr. Matson,

The idea that "stress of capture" is identical to "grouping of
susceptibles", in the case of children in a day-care center vs.
bighorn sheep, implies that children and captured wildlife have similar
autonomic nervous reactions to grouping. I would venture to say that acute
fear reactions and sudden death of day-care children is extremely rare. I
don't imagine that an occasional capture-related death would be considered
an acceptable casualty of grouping children together for the purpose of
study.

Research on captured wildlife and newly grouped livestock species
has shown adverse effects on immune function presumably mediated by high
glucocorticoid levels following initial epinephrine-based fear reactions.
Certainly the wildlife were "grouped" and were presumably "susceptible",
however that does not make them therefore equivalent to a group of children
in a day-care center. In the animal situation, stress of crowding is
further compounded by intense fear reactions. This is the key difference.

Having worked in a day care center during undergraduate days aswell as
worked with captured wild primates during vet school, the situations are
really quite different. Completely hysterical children often have the option
of receiving individual attention or even going home.
