[ProMED has been reporting on an emerging outbreak of shigellosis in Tunisia due to a multidrug resistant (MDR) strain of _S. sonnei_that began in October 2022 (ProMED posts Shigellosis - Africa: Tunisia, Shigella sonnei, MDR, RFI 20221123.8706869 and Shigellosis - Africa (02): Tunisia, Shigella sonnei, MDR, fatal, RFI 20221125.8706901). We were told initially based on the report from 19 Nov 2022 that there were more than "200 cases in a number of governorates, most of them among children, but the infection was also transmitted to some elderly people" and that the strain of _Shigella sonnei_ causing this outbreak was multidrug resistant (https://bit.ly/3guT3by). However, we were not told the drugs to which the strain was resistant. The next news report dated 23 Nov 2022 said 1 death occurred among 69 children, 11 of whom were hospitalized in Tunis. We are now told in the news report above that there are a total of 96 cases with ages ranging from 6 to 80 years, with 6 children admitted to the ICU.

Please see my moderator comments on shigellosis in the 2 prior ProMED posts on this shigellosis outbreak for a general discussion of shigellosis.

More information on the epidemiology of this outbreak in Tunisia would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources to clarify case counts, the extent of this outbreak geographically within Tunisia, and the circumstances surrounding the death of the 8 year old with shigellosis. - Mod.ML
