A San Fernando Valley resident has contracted a mosquitoborne illness that hasn't been recorded in Los Angeles County since 1997, health officials said on Monday [1 Oct 2018]. The elderly woman became ill with St Louis encephalitis in late August 2018, the LA County Department of Public Health said.

St Louis encephalitis, a rare disease similar to West Nile virus, is transmitted through mosquito bites and can cause brain inflammation, paralysis and sometimes death. In the US in 2017, 6 cases of the illness were reported across the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In California, only 5 people tested positive for St. Louis encephalitis from 2008 to 2017. The San Fernando Valley case is the state's 1st reported instance of the disease this year [2018].

Most people infected with St. Louis encephalitis feel perfectly healthy, while others experience mild flu-like symptoms, according to CDC. But in severe cases -- most commonly among those older than 50 -- the disease can lead to fever, coma and convulsions.

Residents can avoid the illness by wearing insect repellent and emptying water from potential mosquito breeding sites such as flower pots, buckets and kiddie pools, said LA County health officer Muntu Davis.

[This is the 2nd report of the presence of St Louis encephalitis [SLE] virus in California this year (2018) and the 1st human case in the state in 2018.

The 1st report this year [2018], by the Fresno Mosquito and Vector Control District, confirmed that culex mosquitoes in Fresno have tested positive for the St Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus. Active SLE virus transmission occurred in several locations in California last year (2017) in localities where it has been absent for many years. Residents in the Fresno area will be wise to follow the advice for avoidance of mosquito bites that is offered above by the FCDPH, since there is a long transmission season of several months ahead.

SLE virus is endemic in the south western USA, and sporadic cases in humans occur there infrequently. In 2015, human cases occurred in the adjoining states of Nevada and Arizona, and positive mosquitoes were found in California. SLE virus was found in mosquitoes in Nevada in 2005. The USA CDC indicates that less than one per cent of St Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) infections are clinically apparent, and the vast majority of infections remain undiagnosed (https://www.cdc.gov/sle/technical/symptoms.html).

Wild birds are the reservoir hosts, and mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are the vectors that transmit SLE virus. The mosquito species in which SLEV was detected are not mentioned in the above report.
