The extreme cold of the past few weeks has adversely affected crops in the state of Punjab. After it detected signs of late blight in potato in Jalandhar and Hoshiarpur [districts], the agriculture department has issued an advisory to farmers in the region to save the remaining crop. The crop would have been ready in February [2020], but farmers say that about 20% of the crop is affected by the disease in the region.

Late blight was noticed in those fields where farmers utilised the stubble instead of burning it, said an agriculture officer. Most farmers are now worried. [A farmer] said most of his crop has been affected by the disease and the infection occurred mostly where he decomposed the stubble in his field.

Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has also sounded an alert in the state and has asked farmers to take measure to control this disease.

[Late blight of potato (PLB) and tomato is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100% crop loss. The pathogen can also affect some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers; in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

The pathogen is spread by plant material (including plant debris such as the stubble mentioned above, potato seed tubers, tomato transplants, volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventative fungicide treatments of planting material, as well as fungicide sprays of crops. Farm-saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks. Certified clean planting stock and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are considered vital to control late blight outbreaks. Commercial crop cultivars vary in susceptibility to late blight. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide. Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different pathogen strains has been observed, but more virulent strains are emerging frequently. In India and the region, PLB outbreaks have been an annual occurrence (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archive). This may be at least partly due to the spread of strain Blue 13 which had been introduced from Europe (ProMED-mail post 20180418.5755980). However, a lack of rigour in applying preventative measures is likely also to blame. Planting a new crop into the debris of a previous one, as in the item above, is a case in point for the latter.
