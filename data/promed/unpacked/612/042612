1998
[Excerpted & translated by Mod.JW]

Five herbivorous animals have died in the last 8 days in the Sapucaia do
Sul zoo, which has 1500 animals. A bacterial infection or contaminated
feed is suspected. Autopsies have been done, and the results are pending.
The animal feed used was changed this month.
The symptoms, which included hemorrhage, were similar to those caused by
the _Clostridium_ bacterium.
The first to die were a goat and Saddam Hussein -- a camel. Then a pair of
zebras died. The female had had an abortion in March, and died suddenly.
The male had respiratory problems, which were not helped by antibiotics,
and died a day later, leaving Duda, their foal, orphaned.
A second camel, Laura, fell ill after Saddam Hussein, with high fever &
sweats which did not respond to antibiotics. She died last Saturday.
