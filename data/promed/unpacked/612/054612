Baby food manufacturer SMA Nutrition has issued a product recall for 2 of
its powder formulas that have been linked to an outbreak of infant botulism.
The [UK] Food Standards Agency said the recall is in relation to batches of
SMA Gold and SMA White infant formula powder with expiration dates of 28
Oct 2001 and 28 Nov 2001.
The move comes after tests on food products used in the home of the family
of an infant botulism case. A spokesman for the Public Health Laboratory
Service (PHLS) said the child involved was a 5-month-old girl and the case
was confirmed last month [July 2001].
An FSA spokesman would not reveal where the recent outbreak took place, but
said tests were done on food used in the infant's home as well as on
samples of the same products. The SMA Gold product tested positive for _C.
botulinum_ type B, the same strain that the infant contracted.
Infant botulism is a rare [in developed countries] but serious food-borne
disease. It is caused by contamination of food by the botulism bacterium
commonly found in soil. The FSA said it is not possible to prove
conclusively that the formula was linked to the outbreak but said it was a
wise precautionary measure.
FSA deputy chief executive Dr Jon Bell said: "SMA Nutrition is acting in a
responsible way and we welcome this precautionary recall. It is important
that no one continues to use these particular batches of SMA Gold and
White. They should be thrown away or returned to the retailer. There is no
reason to believe that this is anything but an isolated one-off incident."
