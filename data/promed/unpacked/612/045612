Is the plague outbreak on hold in Madagascar? Christophe Rogier, director of the Pasteur Institute in Madagascar, revealed information that was not reassuring in his progress report for the fight against the plague in prisons launched by the Ministry of Public Health, by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and by the prison administration.

"The plague remains sporadic but is much more deadly than malaria. The disease can emerge in a locality where the epidemic has not yet hit, as was the case in Ambilobe in 2011. This sporadic case that was not contained can thus turn into an epidemic. We must be very careful because we get a case of plague each week all over the island," said Christophe Rogier.

The main cause of the resurgence of the disease is not very clear. Some doctors argue that the bush fires are pushing the rats to seek refuge in the homes. They carry fleas infected by the plague, then transmit the disease to humans. This theory is in part true, says Christophe Rogier, but the people infected by the plague in Ambilobe lived in the forest in a mining site far from bush fires.

On the other hand, prisons which usually get a lot of cases of plague have not reported any cases yet. In 2012, thanks to the pest control campaign carried out by the ICRC in the prison of Antanimora, 1600 rats were caught. The short film, made by the ICRC to alert people to the fight against this disease, was a moving testimony for a different reason. The prisoners did not get infected by the plague, but the son of the district chief of MiariÂ­narivo, Justin Tata.

"Plague can infect the whole world. The change in behavior must be priority number one," emphasized Christoph Vogt, regional head of delegation of the ICRC in the Indian Ocean.

Faced with this situation, Philemon Tafangy, general secretary of the ministry of public health, accused other entities. "Let's not only accuse the ministry of public health, but let's ask the right questions: Who should collect the trash so as not to attract the rats? Who is responsible for the lack of drugs in the health centers? Who is in charge of prohibiting bush fires in order not to disturb the natural habitat of rodents? Who should encourage people to go to health centers when they are sick?" he asked.
