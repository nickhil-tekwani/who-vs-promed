Translation of information received on 29 Jul 2003 from Dr Malek Zrelli,
Director General of Veterinary Services, Ministry of Agriculture,
Environment and Water Resources, Tunis: [This background information was
erroneously omitted in yesterday's posting. ProMED-mail apologizes for the
oversight. - Mod.MPP]
Report date: 1 Jul 2003.
Following the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease (FMD) reported in Libya
on 18 Jun 2003 (see OIE Disease Information, vol. 16, No. 25 dated 20 Jun
2003), Tunisia has set up a control system for FMD virus type SAT 2,
comprising:
- Ban on the movement of animals and animal products from Libya.
- Compulsory disinfection of all vehicles arriving from Libya.
- Heightened close surveillance of all herds/flocks of susceptible species
in the area close to the border.
- Serological surveillance of animals having been in Libya at any time
during the past 3 months.
- Acquisition of a stock of vaccine against FMD virus type SAT 2 which,
upon arrival, will be used for all susceptible species in the southern and
central Governorates bordering Libya, and which, depending on how the FMD
situation in Libya develops, could be used throughout the country (the
order was placed on 23 Jun 2003 and delivery is due to take place during
the first week of July 2003).
- Acquisition of diagnostic kits for FMD virus.
- Information and a proposal to Libya on coordinated and concerted action
to control the disease.

[We are grateful to Dr Pinto for expediently responding to our query and
providing ProMED-mail with the above OIE update.
The early response of Tunisia to the developments in neighbouring Libya
should be praised. Surveillance and preventive sanitary activities in the
region are crucial in order to prevent the spread of the exotic FMD
serotype SAT 2 within the large, susceptible animal populations in Northern
Africa and beyond.
During the FMD outbreak in North Africa in 1999, Algeria was affected
initially, followed by outbreaks in Tunisia and the eastern part of Morocco
(see references). The proximity of Libya to Malta and the connections
between the 2 countries, must also be considered when evaluating the situation.
ProMED-mail will follow the developments of this outbreak; assistance of
the involved parties in providing additional information will be highly
valued. - Mod.AS]
