Ginger yield slumps in Pemathang
--------------------------------
A strange disease has hampered ginger yield in Pemathang gewog [group of
villages] in Samdrup Jongkhar [district]. The gewog was once famous for
ginger production. In the past, farmers would sell over 20 truckloads of
ginger in a season but last year, the yield decreased to only 4 truckloads.

40 kg [88 lb] of seed [rhizomes] would yield 800 kg [about 1760 lb] of
ginger in the past. Today, when all conditions are favourable, the yield is
only about 120 kg [265 lb]. Despite the drastic drop, the farmers still
grow the crop since it is their main cash crop.

The farmers are not sure whether it is because of climate change, change in
monsoon pattern, loss of soil fertility, ginger wilt disease, or all of
them. But a few weeks after the shoot comes up, it turns yellow and the
whole plant dies. A farmer said, "We were told that we needed to order
medicine but we do not know what disease affects the crop." They said the
disease is widespread in the district.

Most of the farmers said the government should allow them to buy ginger
seeds from the Indian state of Meghalaya, which hasn't been infected, and
the tubers are larger than Pemathang ones.

[Wilt diseases of ginger (often associated with rhizome rots) due to
bacterial pathogens (_Ralstonia solanacearum_, _Erwinia_ species) and fungi
(_Fusarium_ or _Pythium_ species) have been reported from various
locations. For example, yield losses of up to 50 per cent have been
reported for _R. s._ wilt in Hawaii. In affected areas, generally even
plants derived from disease-free rhizomes have a very high risk of being
infected from surrounding pathogen reservoirs. Although a definite
diagnosis is not given above, it appears likely that one or several of
these pathogens may be contributing to the problems in Bhutan.
