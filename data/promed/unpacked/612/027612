A man has died of suspected avian influenza in southern China, just over the
border from Hong Kong, the territory's Centre for Health Protection announced.
The Health Department of Guangdong Province and the Ministry of Health told
the Hong Kong government that a 32-year-old Chinese man developed fever and
pneumonia on 22 Feb 2006 and died on 2 Mar 2006, the Centre said in a
statement late on Friday [3 Mar 2006].
The risk of avian influenza appearing in people in Hong Kong was also
increasing, the Head of the Centre for Health Protection, Leung Pak-yin, was
quoted as saying on Saturday in the English-language daily South China Morning
Post. "We expect there could be human cases in Hong Kong and we all need to be
well-prepared for that."
Hong Kong is less than 2 hours from Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, by
train, and the flow of travellers between the 2 cities is heavy. Although Hong
Kong has been free from human cases of the H5N1 bird flu virus since early
2003, the city continues to screen the temperatures of people entering the
city at immigration.
If Beijing confirmed the case as avian influenza, Hong Kong's public hospitals
and clinics would be required to report any influenza cases with unclear
diagnoses to the Centre, the paper said, adding that the Guangdong man often
visited wet markets where poultry were killed.
Local authorities also attempted to muzzle local coverage, the newspaper
said. "The Guangdong Propaganda and Health Departments jointly issued a notice
to local media not to report on the case, saying there should be no coverage
until it was confirmed," it said.
Experts familiar with the situation in China have always maintained that there
have been outbreaks of H5N1 in birds in Guangdong province as early as the
first half of 2005, but China has always denied this. Despite outbreaks in
several other areas in mainland China, this is the first time that Chinese
officials have said that there could be a case in Guangdong province.
There were more than 30 bird flu outbreaks in poultry across China during 2005
and at least 14 people have been infected by the H5N1 virus, killing 8 of
them. Bird flu has killed at least 94 people in East Asia and the Middle East
since late 2003.

Guangdong Provincial Health Department declared on Saturday [4 Mar 2006] that
a suspected human case of bird flu had been found in Guangzhou, capital of
South China's Guangdong Province. The patient died on Thursday [2 Mar 2006]
after all resuscitation attempts failed. He was 32 and a local resident of
Guangzhou. He started to show symptoms of fever and pneumonia on 22 Feb 2006.
Preliminary investigation showed that the patient had stayed for a lengthy
period at a nearby live poultry slaughtering site where he carried out a
market survey.
The provincial government immediately launched emergency measures to prevent
and control the disease. People in close contact with the patient have been
isolated for medical observation. The places near where the patient had been
staying have been disinfected to prevent the disease from spreading.
This information has been reported to the Ministry of Health. Statistics show
the Ministry of Health has reported 14 human cases of bird flu; 8 of them died
and the rest have recovered.
[If confirmed, the man will be China's 9th bird flu fatality. Another 6 people
infected with the virus have survived. A map of Guangdong province which shows
the proximity of Guangzhou to Hong Kong can be accessed at

A 3-year-old boy from Indonesia's Central Java province has died of avian
influenza, a senior health official said on Saturday, citing the results of a
local test. If confirmed by a WHO-recognised laboratory, the boy would be the
country's 21st death from H5N1 virus infection, which is now endemic in
poultry in the world's 4th most populous nation.
"A local test of (the boy) who died yesterday or the day before yesterday, was
positive," Hariadi Wibisono, director of control of animal-borne diseases at
the national health ministry, told Reuters. A sample of the boy's blood has
been sent for confirmation to a laboratory in Hong Kong approved by the World
Health Organisation, he added. The boy had been in contact with fowl,
according to initial information. Contact with infected birds is the most
common means of transmission of the H5N1 virus to humans.
Bird flu has killed at least 94 people in East Asia and the Middle East since
late 2003 and scientists fear the virus could mutate and spread easily from
person to person, triggering a pandemic that could kill millions and cripple
economies.
Of Indonesia's internationally confirmed fatalities from the H5N1 virus, 9
have been in 2006, making it the country with the most bird flu deaths so far
this year.
H5N1 has killed birds in more than 30 countries in the Middle East, Asia,
Europe and Africa. It has spread to 14 new countries in the past month. In
Indonesia, the highly pathogenic strain of bird flu has affected birds in
about 2/3 of the country's provinces.
Stamping out the virus is a huge, if not impossible, task in Indonesia, a
sprawling archipelago of about 17 000 islands and 220 million people. The
government has resisted the mass culling of fowl seen in some other nations,
citing the expense and the impracticality in a country where the keeping of a
few chickens or ducks in backyards of homes is common in cities and on farms.
Agencies have concentrated instead on selective culling, and on public
education and hygiene measures aimed at prevention. A sweeping door-to-door
campaign to try to control the disease in Jakarta, the capital and the
country's biggest city with about 12 million people, only got underway at the
end of February 2006. Agriculture officials estimate that Jakarta alone has
some 500 000 fowl.

If this case and the suspected case in Guangdong province of China are
confirmed, the global total of human avian influenza fatalities will become
96. - Mod.CP]
