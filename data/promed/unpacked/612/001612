Health officials are urging those living in Whistler [British Columbia] to make sure their mumps vaccinations are up to date after an outbreak among young adults.

Vancouver Coastal Health Medical Health Officer Dr Paul Martiquet says 11 cases of the mumps have been reported in Whistler, a tourist town populated by foreign workers.

"Some of them aren't up to date with their immunization status, as a result, we've had mumps outbreaks [the last one in] 2011. We are advising everyone who was born after 1970 to make sure they are immunized, and to make sure they've had 2 doses of the vaccine -- not just one."

The highly contagious viral infection causes fever and swelling of the salivary glands. It is spread through coughing, sneezing, or sharing cups or utensils touched by saliva or mucus [of an infected person].

Outbreaks of mumps continue to occur in Canada and the proportion of cases aged 20 years and older has increased. Complications such as orchitis (inflammation of the testicles) and oophoritis (inflammation of the ovaries) are relatively frequent; permanent sequelae like deafness are rare.

Mumps vaccine is available as measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) or measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine. Mumps vaccine effectiveness has been estimated at 62 to 91 percent for 1 dose and at 76 to 95 percent for 2 doses. Reactions to MMR and MMRV vaccine are generally mild and transient and include pain and redness at the injection site, low-grade fever, and rash.
