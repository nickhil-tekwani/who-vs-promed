11 Nov 2016 Liberia: School enrolment in Liberia is higher today than it was before the Ebola epidemic
https://blogs.worldbank.org/education/school-enrolment-liberia-higher-today-it-was-ebola-epidemic
[Apart from an immediate impact on the country's GDP (estimated to be USD 300 million), the education community was concerned that the [Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak] would have a lasting effect on the development of human capital. Schools had to shut down for almost all of the 2014-2015 academic year, and there were concerns that students, who had been out of school for such a long period of time, would not return. A World Bank survey conducted in April 2015 found that only 75 percent of respondents with primary school-aged children reported that their children returned to school.
With schools up and running again for the entire 2015-2016 academic year, the Ministry of Education has been working in partnership with the World Bank to determine the impact of [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] on enrollment trends. It's important to note that this isn't a straightforward exercise since Liberia's next household survey is still a couple of years away and isn't comprehensive.
The post-EVD recovery has been marked by significant recovery and enrollment, and is up to the 2011-12 levels. ...more]

31 Oct 2016 Nigeria: How an Ebola campaign in Nigeria discouraged bushmeat consumption
http://mgafrica.com/article/2016-10-31-how-an-ebola-campaign-in-nigeria-discouraged-bushmeat-consumption/
[Since the outbreak of Ebola [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] in West Africa, a number of countries have initiated information campaigns to decrease the consumption of bushmeat.
Since the EVD outbreak was brought under control, many governments in countries affected by EVD have launched massive media and propaganda campaigns to decrease the consumption of bushmeat. These countries include Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria. The campaigns have included distributing information door-to-door as well as promotions on radio, newspapers and television.
The campaign in Nigeria was particularly well-planned and involved broadcasting on television and radio and publishing in newspapers. I was involved in a research project to assess the impact of the campaign. We found that it had a dramatic effect on the trade in bushmeat. This could provide useful lessons for other countries. ...more]
[If this decrease in the trade in bushmeat can be sustained, it would be one positive outcome of this terrible outbreak. But unfortunately, see next report. - Mod.LK]

5 Nov 2016 Nigeria (Lagos): Ebola: Bush meat business booms in Lagos
http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/11/ebola-bush-meat-business-booms-lagos/
[Some bush meat sellers in some major markets in Lagos have said the business is booming again barely 2 years after the country was declared [Ebola-virus-disease] free. Some of the bush meat sellers told newsmen on Sat [5 Nov 2016] that they were fully back to their business. According to [the sellers], their customers, who deserted them because of fear of contracting Ebola, are back, and they are experiencing more patronage. Mr. Badaru said, when compared to during the EVD outbreak, he is now making more money.]
[It is not clear which report is correct regarding bush meat, i.e., business booming as stated here or decreasing as in the previous report. - Mod.LK]

1 Nov 2016: UK forms global infection response team
http://www.bbc.com/news/health-37827388
[The UK [United Kingdom] has created a specialist "rapid response" team of health experts who can be deployed anywhere around the world within 48 hours if a disease outbreak strikes. The aim is to stamp out infections, like Ebola, before they spread far and wide. The scientists, academics and clinicians will be funded by GBP 20 million [USD 24.5 million] from the government over 5 years.
When not responding to an immediate emergency, the rapid response team will assess future disease threats and train colleagues from home and abroad. Public Health Minister Nicola Blackwood said the Ebola crisis highlighted the need for such a team.]

1 Nov 2016 (Ahead of print): Unusual Ebola virus chain of transmission, Conakry, Guinea, 2014-2015
http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/12/16-0847_article
[Ebola transmission chain analysis highlights viral longevity in semen
-----------------------------------
A study from the World Health Organization (WHO) tracked an 11-month transmission chain that ended with a case of Ebola virus in Guinea, suggesting the disease should be considered transmissible in semen for at least 12 months.
In a new report published in Emerging Infectious Diseases, researchers detailed the unusual transmission route for a case-patient who presented with Ebola in October 2015. Eleven months earlier, the patient's brother-in-law tested positive for Ebola. The man recovered and refrained from intercourse with his wife for 6 months, resuming sex about 9 months post-infection. In September of 2015, the woman had a mild illness that was likely undiagnosed Ebola, and through close household contact spread it to her brother. The woman's serologic tests were positive for Ebola, but no genomic data were available.
The interval between the case-patient's onset of symptoms and that of the woman's mild and missed Ebola illness was about 30 days, longer than the usual maximum incubation period of 21 days.
Epidemiologic and molecular evidence support this unusual chain of Ebola transmission. The authors of the study said this case supports the WHO's updated January 2016 recommendation that safe sex should be practiced between couples for 12 month post-Ebola exposure. Alternatively, semen can be tested every 3 months post-illness, and sex can be resumed after 2 negative tests.

- Abstract
In October 2015, a new case of Ebola virus disease in Guinea was detected. Case investigation, serology, and whole-genome sequencing indicated possible transmission of the virus from an Ebola virus disease survivor to another person and then to the case-patient reported here. This transmission chain over 11 months suggests slow Ebola virus evolution. ...more
- Conclusions
A likely explanation of our observations, integrating genomic, serologic, and epidemiologic data, is that within-marriage sexual transmission occurred (inferred from the positive IgM titers of the woman) and then the woman infected her brother through close contact. They all lived in the same small household in poor hygienic conditions; shared toilets, meals, and at times beds; and cared for each other. Alternatively, a 3rd unknown person may have been the link in the transmission from the survivor to the case-patient.
Interim advice with regard to sexual transmission of EBOV has been updated recently. All EVD survivors and their sex partners should receive condoms and counseling to ensure safer sex practices. Safer sex practices should continue until the results of semen testing are negative twice or, if testing is unavailable, for 12 months. The safer sex strategy and testing could be complemented by new medical countermeasures that need to be assessed and include use of antiviral drugs, vaccination of relatives and sex partners of survivors, or both.
[This is an important report; doctors and health care practitioners need to be made aware of this longer period of potential Ebola virus transmission so they can advise patients appropriately who have recovered from infection. - Mod.LK]

3 Nov 2016: Ebola Mutated During West Africa Epidemic, Studies Find
http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/ebola-mutated-during-west-africa-epidemic-study-finds-n677476
Article. [The Ebola virus [EBOV] mutated early on in the 2013-2016 West African epidemic, taking on a simple change that made it infect human cells more easily, researchers reported on Thu 3 Nov 2016 in back to back papers].
Two separate studies point to the same change, a single mutation in the part of the virus that helps it infect cells.
After this change, which happened very early in the epidemic, the mutant virus swept out of Guinea, across Liberia and Sierra Leone, and was carried by travelers to Nigeria, Mali and a hospital in Dallas, Texas.
According to J Luban of the University of Massachusetts Medical School, who helped discover the mutation, "It had never been seen before, and it persisted. Pretty much from that point out, it never went away. Every version observed after that had that mutation. It is also the virus that traveled not just to Sierra Leone and Liberia but even to an emergency room in Texas."
Previous outbreaks had been small and limited, and doctors wondered whether the virus had changed. It had. The mutation is called A82V, and it's a subtle yet effective change. Researchers wrote: "The A82V substitution alone resulted in an almost 2-fold increase in infectivity in human cells."
Luban's team, working with HIV [human immunodeficiency virus], had been looking for what are called host factors, differences in human cells that make it harder or easier for viruses to infect them.
The team used a standard technique, swapping in bits of other viruses, including Ebola. Like Ball's [a 2nd study] team, they did not work with living, infectious viruses, but [rather] cassettes of genetic material called plasmids. They noticed some of the Ebola virus proteins were more infectious than others.
"I would say it was almost an accident," Luban said. "We were studying something, and we stumbled upon this discovery."
Lina Moses of Tulane University says poverty and a lack of any organized health care system allowed the epidemic to happen. She said: "The more time you give it to change, the more chance it will. As long as there are countries that do not have proper health systems, everyone in the world is vulnerable." ...more]

Infection studies still need to be conducted in vivo in NHP to confirm that the genetic differences are effective in live animals. Most likely, factors leading to the rapid spread of the virus were multifactorial, and this mutation may have contributed.

3 Nov 2016. Ebola and public behavior
http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/the-ebola-crisis-and-the-corresponding-public-behavior-a-system-dynamics-approach/
[Sharareh N, Sabounchi NS, Sayama H, et al. (3 Nov 2016). The Ebola Crisis and the Corresponding Public Behavior: A System Dynamics Approach. PLOS Currents Outbreaks, Edition 1. DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.3750774.
Background. The interaction of several sociocultural and environmental factors during an epidemic crisis leads to behavioral responses that consequently make the crisis control a complex problem.
Methods. The system dynamics approach has been adopted to study the relationships between spread of disease, public attention, situational awareness, and community's response to the Ebola epidemic.
Results: In developing different simulation models to capture the trend of death and incidence data from the World Health Organization for the Ebola outbreak, the final model has the best fit to the historical trends. Results demonstrate that the increase of quarantining rate over time due to increase in situational awareness and performing safe burials had a significant impact on the control of epidemic. However, public attention did not play a significant role.
Conclusion. The best fit to historical data are achieved when behavioral factors specific to West Africa -- like studying situational awareness and public attention -- are included in the model. However, by ignoring the sociocultural factors, the model is not able to represent the reality; therefore, in the case of any epidemics, it is necessary that all the parties and community members find the most significant behavioral factors that can curb the epidemic.

29 Oct 2016: The ethics of hunting down "Patient Zero"
http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/sunday-review/the-ethics-of-hunting-down-patient-zero.html?_r=0
[The alleged "Patient Zero" of the American AIDS epidemic -- a French-Canadian flight attendant who died of AIDS in 1984 -- was exonerated last week. Genetic sequencing of blood samples stored since the 1970s showed that the strain infecting him had circulated among gay men in New York for several years before he arrived here in 1974. Therefore, although he had hundreds of sexual partners in several cities, he did not introduce the virus to North America; he was a victim before he was a vector.
This raises the ethical question: Is it right to hunt down the 1st case in any outbreak, to find every Patient Zero?
We now know that a toddler playing in a bat-infested tree in the Guinean village of Meliandou may have sent Ebola spinning across West Africa in 2014, and that a 5-year-old of La Gloria, Mexico, a pig-farming town, was probably the world's 1st case of swine flu in 2009.
Should they all be publicly named and vilified like Mary Mallon, the Irish cook who became known as Typhoid Mary and died after 23 years quarantined on an island in the East River in New York? Or like Dr. Craig Spencer, who caught Ebola through medical heroism in Africa, infected no one, and yet was accused of endangering all New York? Or like Kaci Hickox, the "Ebola nurse" quarantined in New Jersey though she didn't even have Ebola?
Many ethicists say "no." They disapprove of stigmatizing any patient, and the best preventive is to not hunt one down.
But epidemiologists disagree. To them, it is vital to trace the source of every outbreak, because that is often the only way to stop it. ...more]
[An interesting ethical question. Of course, one can trace the source of the outbreak without publicly naming individuals, which would protect anonymity and prevent possible repercussions on the individual and his/her family. - Mod.LK]

[According to Finance and Development Planning Minister Boima Kamara, Liberia will need USD 1.3 billion to revive an economy that was ravaged by a slump in its key export commodities and the worst epidemic of [Ebola virus disease (EVD)]. Kamara also said Liberia will invest in energy projects to stimulate its manufacturing sector while prioritizing agriculture after economic expansion almost came to a standstill over the past 3 years, Kamara said in an interview in the capital, Monrovia. The country is targeting average annual economic growth of about 6 percent for the 7 years starting 2018, after averaging about 8 percent between 2006 and 2013.]

[It is encouraging that people continue to travel in spite of media reports on danger from health related issues and terrorism, as it broadens the mind and increases cross-cultural understanding. However, most of the travel was to Mexico, Canada, and the UK, so Americans may not be as adventurous as it 1st appears. - Mod.LK]

2 Nov 2016: Containing Ebola at the source with ring vaccination. http://bit.ly/2f19r18)
[Merler S, Ajellli M, Funanelli L. (2 Nov 2016). Containing Ebola at the Source with Ring Vaccination. PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.
http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005093.
Abstract.
- Interim results from the Guinea Ebola ring vaccination trial suggest high efficacy of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine. These findings open the door to the use of ring vaccination strategies in which the contacts and contacts of contacts of each index case are promptly vaccinated to contain future Ebola virus disease outbreaks. To provide a numerical estimate of the effectiveness of ring vaccination strategies, we introduce a spatially explicit agent-based model to simulate Ebola outbreaks in the Pujehun district, Sierra Leone, structurally similar to previous modelling approaches. We find that ring vaccination can successfully contain an outbreak for values of the effective reproduction number up to 1.6. Through an extensive sensitivity analysis of parameters characterising the readiness and capacity of the health care system, we identify interventions that, alongside ring vaccination, could increase the likelihood of containment. In particular, shortening the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation to 2-3 days on average through improved contact tracing procedures, adding a 2-km spatial component to the vaccination ring, and decreasing human mobility by quarantining affected areas might contribute to increasing our ability to contain outbreaks with effective reproduction numbers of up to 2.6. These results have implications for future control of Ebola and other emerging infectious disease threats.]

30 Oct 2016 Sierra Leone: Ebola vaccine shows promise in STRIVE trial
http://www.vaccineconfidence.org/sierra-leone-ebola-vaccine-shows-promise-in-strive-trial/
An investigational Ebola vaccine administered to health care professionals and response workers in Sierra Leone was not associated with serious adverse events, according to preliminary phase II/III results from the STRIVE trial.
According to Susan Goldstein, MD of CDC's [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and colleagues, 8638 adult participants in 5 districts in Sierra Leone were enrolled from April to August 2015. The participants were randomly assigned to receive the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine (Merck) within 7 days of enrollment or within 18 to 24 weeks of enrollment. Initially, the researchers considered a stepped wedge trial design with sequential group vaccination but opted to conduct phased enrollment to increase the chances of determining vaccine efficacy if the outbreak waned and to be able to vaccinate participants earlier and increase the sample size.
The participants were assessed for the incidence of Ebola virus disease (EVD) and serious adverse events 6 months after vaccination or enrollment. Goldstein and colleagues planned to determine vaccine efficacy based on EVD incidence in the vaccinated and deferred (unvaccinated) groups.
According to the data, there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events or deaths among vaccinated participants (n=8016). The safety profile of the vaccine was similar to that of other published studies, Goldstein said at IDWeek 2016. 72 participants were evaluated by PCR, and all tested negative for EVD. However, because no EVD cases occurred, vaccine efficacy could not be determined.
In September 2015, an Ebola case was reported within one of the STRIVE study districts. Consequently, the researchers administered the vaccine to about 100 unvaccinated participants. No other EVD infections were detected in the region; however, the researchers were not able to determine whether early vaccination contributed to prevention of additional cases.
Goldstein said: "As our study comes to an end, we recognize that STRIVE was much bigger than a clinical trial. Yes, we rapidly implemented a clinical trial with over 8000 people and collected important safety and immunogenicity data that will be used for vaccine licensure, but we also built capacity. We trained over 350 Sierra Leonean staff, developed a clinical trials platform, and enhanced research and response capacity that we hope left the country better positioned to continue this work going forward."

[There is hope for an [Ebola-virus-disease (EVD)]-free future as development of the vaccine rVSV-EBOV to fight the Ebola virus is almost done, with only one trial remaining before rolling out the vaccine.
The Senior Program Specialist at International Development Research Center (IDRC) has told Capital FM that [Phase III clinical trials have already been carried out, and the vaccine has been proven to be safe for use.
"Merck pharmaceutical has already bought the license for the vaccine and, hopefully, we will be seeing that vaccine being rolled out soon." According to Samuel Oti of the International Development Research Center, once the vaccine is rolled out, priority will go to countries that have had Ebola outbreaks recently and their neighboring countries.
Development of the Ebola Vaccine has been done by the Public Health Agency of Canada, and it has taken the agency about 14 years to complete development of the vaccine according to the Head of Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapy.]
