[3] Indonesia: a review

http://www.theborneopost.com/2014/07/20/govt-to-declare-dengue-hot-spots-as-outbreak-areas/


The government will declare dengue hot spots as outbreak areas if dengue cases continue to rise, said Deputy Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin.

He said such a move would give full power to the health minister to implement prevention and control initiatives in accordance to the Destruction of Disease-Bearing Insects Act 1975 (Amendment 2000).

"The residents cannot object and the local authorities cannot stop if the area is declared as an outbreak area because, if it is not addressed, it will bring about a bigger disaster.

"We will enforce this matter seriously and I would like to warn that all enforcement provisions will be used, including imposing compounds listed under the act to address the problem," he told a media conference after a working inspection in conjunction with the dengue fever prevention campaign at the I-City condominium site at Section 7 here [in Shah Alam, Selangor] yesterday [19 Jul 2014].

From January to [17 Jul 2014], 50 804 dengue cases were reported nationwide, an increase of 36 222 cases or 248 per cent from only 14 582 cases for the same period last year [2013]. 94 deaths from dengue fever were also reported, a rise of 224 per cent from only 29 deaths during the same period in 2013.

Earlier Muhyiddin, who was accompanied by health minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam and his deputy, Datuk Seri Dr Hilmi Yahaya, and Deputy Works minister Datuk Rosnah Abdul Rashid Shirlin, also made a working visit to Kampung Padang Jawa [a few kilometres west of Shah Alam], one of the dengue hot spots in Selangor.

On his visit to the kampung, the deputy prime minister said, he had received complaints that the contractors responsible did not clean up the rubbish or solid wastes as often as possible given that the area was densely populated and houses closely located.

He said similar problems occurred in many other areas in Selangor due to the state government's failure to fully implement the Soil Waste Management and Public Cleanliness Act. "The state government appoints contractors but the work done was inadequate, so it is my worry that if it is not fully implemented by competent contractors with sufficient equipment, then the current outbreak in Selangor will continue," he said.

Currently 66 per cent of the dengue outbreak in the country occurred in Selangor. As such, Muhyiddin urged the Selangor government, especially the local authorities, to play their respective roles more seriously to reduce dengue fever cases in the state.

On controlling dengue fever outbreak in construction sites, he said, his ministry had received feedback from the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) that revealed the level of awareness among the community involved in the construction projects such as project owners, contractors, consultants, project managers and workers were still low.

Citing his inspection at the I-City condominium site, he found that dengue outbreak control in the area was also still low.

Hence, he said, to address the matter CIDB had emphasised that all professional consultants, especially architects and engineers involved in the design, played their roles in ensuring their sites were free from becoming _Aedes_ mosquito-breeding areas and to give priority to the safety of the people in the vicinity of the construction areas.

Cuba
- Camaguey province, request for information. 25 Jul 2014. Dengue: according to an anonymous source, more than 1000 DHF cases are being cared for in classrooms and hostels in the Medical Sciences University Carlos Finlay in the province of Camaguey. The source indicated that officials are considering declaring a dengue epidemic in the province.

[If this information is accurate, Camaguey is undergoing a very significant dengue outbreak. Occurrence of 1000 DHF cases is a very high number. If the DHF cases are 10 per cent of total dengue virus infections, which would be high, then at least 10 000 cases have occurred. Because information provided anonymously must be interpreted with caution, ProMED would appreciate confirmation of this information.

[3] Indonesia - a review
Date: 26 Jul 2014

[Ref: Karyanti MR, Uiterwaal CS, Kusriastuti R, et al: The changing incidence of dengue haemorrhagic fever in Indonesia: a 45-year registry-based analysis. BMC Infect Dis. 2014 Jul 26;14(1):412]

Abstract
--------
Increases in human population size, dengue vector-density and human mobility cause rapid spread of dengue virus in Indonesia. We investigated the changes in dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) incidence in Indonesia over a 45-year period and determined age-specific trends in annual DHF incidence.

Methods: Using an on-going nationwide dengue surveillance program starting in 1968, we evaluated all DHF cases and related deaths longitudinally up to 2013.

Population demographics were used to calculate annual incidence and case fatality ratios (CFRs). Age-specific data on DHF available from 1993 onwards were used to assess trends in DHF age-distribution.

Time-dependency of DHF incidence and CFRs was assessed using the Cochrane-Armitage trend test.

Results: The annual DHF incidence increased from 0.05/100 000 in 1968 to approximately 35-40/100 000 in 2013, with superimposed epidemics demonstrating a similar increasing trend with the highest epidemic occurring in 2010 (85.70/100 000; p less than 0.01). The CFR declined from 41 percent in 1968 to 0.73 percent in 2013 (p less than 0.01).

Mean age of DHF cases increased during the observation period. Highest incidence of DHF was observed among children aged 5 to 14 years up to 1998, but declined thereafter (p less than 0.01).

In those aged 15 years or over, DHF incidence increased (p less than 0.01) and surpassed that of 5 to 14 year olds from 1999 onwards.

Conclusions: Incidence of DHF over the past 45 years in Indonesia increased rapidly with peak incidence shifting from young children to older age groups. The shifting age pattern should have consequences for targeted surveillance and prevention.
