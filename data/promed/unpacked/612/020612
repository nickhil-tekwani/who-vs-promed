A cholera outbreak in the Sierra Leonean capital of Freetown and
surrounding areas has made 1433 people ill, of whom 47 have died over the
past 2 months, health officials said on Wed, 18 Oct 2006.
According to the latest weekly report by an anti-cholera special task
force, "47 people have died between (mid) Aug and 12 Oct 2006".
Alhassan Sesay, director of disease prevention and control at the health
ministry, said health organisations including the Red Cross, Doctors
Without Borders, the WHO and Unicef have stepped up prevention campaigns.
Health workers in outlying clinics said symptoms of the disease started
appearing in August 2006 but "deaths shot up later in Sep and early Oct"
2006 according to a nurse reached by telephone.
Most cases are occurring in the outlying communities at Kissy Grassfield,
Wellington and Calabar Town of the war-ravaged West African country hit
shortages of potable water in recent weeks.
"Many of the deaths were due to patients being brought late to clinics,"
said the nurse.
Over 60 people died in Sierra Leone's last major cholera outbreak in 2004.

recuperating at Mnyamani hospital out 60 who were admitted there in serious
condition during the weekend (14-15 Oct 2006).

access to pipe-borne water and the rest depend on water frequently vended
in unhygienic plastic paper bags and sold in unsanitary conditions. Cholera
has become endemic in the city. The perennial water crisis also affects
sewerage disposal. Over the past year, nearly 1000 cholera-related deaths

At least 4 persons have died while more than 40 others have fallen ill
following an outbreak of cholera in Myagdi district in western Nepal, the
National News Agency, RSS, reported on Fri, 13 Oct 2006. According to the
RSS, the disease has spread in Takam village in the district due to food
contamination.
Villagers suspect that the disease spread across the village, some 400 km
west of Kathmandu, as a result of consuming meat of a sick buffalo during
the Dashain festival, the biggest festival in the country earlier this
month. Meanwhile, a medical team has been dispatched from the district
headquarters, Beni for the affected area, the report said.

After dengue and malaria, Mumbai might have just found itself a more deadly
enemy: cholera. JJ Hospital sources told DNA that 12 patients have been
admitted with symptoms of cholera. "The hanging drop tests performed on
these patients had indicated the presence of the cholera bacterium, _Vibrio
cholerae_," said a source. The samples have been sent for culture tests,
which will finally confirm if the patients have cholera.
Suspected cholera cases have been trickling into JJ Hospital starting on 5
Oct 2006. "Most cases have been reported from the Don Taki area of Mumbai
Port Trust. The patients have been isolated in the hospital's medical
ward," a top doctor of the hospital told DNA.
Don Taki has large slums and is considered a high-risk area. Admitting
there were patients with cholera symptoms, JJ Hospital Superintendent Dr
Arun Pol said, "We're in touch with municipal authorities."

[The hanging drop technique is described uses the finding of darting
motility and its inhibition by specific antisera, especially after brief
inoculation of feces in broth, for tentative identification of cholera
bacilli. Confirmation should be made by culture. The method is as follows:
1. Prepare a hanging drop from alkaline peptone water which has been
inoculated with feces and incubated at 37 degrees C for 4-6 hours.
2. Examine it under high-power dry microscope lens.
3. Darting motility characteristic of vibrios is suggestive of diagnosis.
4. If available, add one drop of _V. cholerae_ O1 antiserum (without
preservative) to hanging drop preparation and reexamine for motility.
Immobilization of organisms gives a presumptive diagnosis of cholera.

On Sun, 15 Oct 2006, it was learned from Taihu County in Anqing City, Anhui
Province that bacillary dysentery was recently detected at Xincang Middle
School in Taihu County's Xincang Township. At the time of this writing,
34 students remained hospitalized. None are in critical
condition. Preliminary investigations indicate that the disease was caused
by students drinking unclean water.
According to the Anhui Provincial Health Bureau, on 13 Oct 2006 Xincang
Middle School discovered that some students had diarrhea. On the morning
of 14 Oct 2006, there was a gradual increase in students with diarrhea at
the school. The Taihu County Committee and county government immediately
put an emergency response plan into action. The school, township, and
hospital launched a thorough search. 100 students with similar symptoms
were examined in hospitals. Of these, 70 were admitted for treatment and
observation.
Anhui Province health departments are actively treating students who have
diarrhea; they have gathered samples of tap water at the school and stool
from students with diarrhea for lab analysis. _Shigella sonnei_ was
identified in the stool of patients. Total bacteria count and _E. coli_ in
the school's tap water exceed limits. At present all students with
diarrhea are undergoing active treatment. The health department provided
preventive medicine to those who are in close contact with the students.
