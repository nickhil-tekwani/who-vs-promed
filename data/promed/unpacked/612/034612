On Tue 6 Jan 2009, a fatal human case of highly pathogenic avian
[H5N1] influenza occurred in Beijing. Sources say that the deceased
had contact with freshly slaughtered duck meat purchased at Yanjiao
Xinggong Market in Sanhe City of Hebei Province.

On 7 Dec 2008, Xinhua learned from Sanhe City government that no
avian influenza event has occurred in the area.

[Rapporteur Dan Silver has extracted the following additional
information from a Chinese-language newspaper
<http://www.afinance.cn/new/gncj/200901/172856.html>:
"The patient is a native of Putian City in Fujian Province. She moved
to Beijing in February 2008 and resides in Sanjianfang East Village
in Chaoyang District, Beijing. Acquaintances of the patient bought 9
live ducks in Yanjiao Qingong Market in Hebei Province on 19 Dec
2008, which were slaughtered on site but cleaned by the patient back
home [in Beijing]."

It appears that the infection was contracted from a duck purchased in
a market in Yanjiao Qingong Market in Hebei Province and not near the
patient's place of residence in Beijing nor in her home town in
Fujian province. The patient seems to have been one of several people
purchasing ducks from the same source, none of whom apart from the
19-year-old woman contracted avian H5N1 influenza virus infection.
