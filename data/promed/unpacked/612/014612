A first case of monkeypox has been discovered in the principality, Dr Olivia Keïta-Perse, head of the epidemiology and hygiene department at the Princess Grace Hospital, said on Thursday evening [21 Jul 2022].

Three other patients have also undergone tests. The Monaco government has ordered vaccines, Dr Keïta-Perse said.

Abstract
--------
Since May 2022, an international monkeypox (MPX) outbreak has been ongoing in more than 50 countries. While most cases are men who have sex with men, transmission is not restricted to this population. In this report, we describe the case of a male child younger than 10 years with MPX in the Netherlands. Despite thorough source tracing, a likely source of infection has not been identified. No secondary cases were identified in close contacts.

Conclusion
----------
With this case description, we wish to raise awareness among clinicians that MPX can develop in children and be present in the general population. We advise prompt diagnostic testing in case of clinical symptoms potentially related to MPX to prevent potential undetected transmission in the community. We advocate vaccination for high-risk contacts to prevent potential disease and successive transmission.

[5] Control and vaccine availability

The World Health Organization (WHO) hasn't called the current monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), but as a worldwide epidemic, it is clearly an emerging pandemic. More than 12 556 monkeypox cases and 3 deaths have been reported in 68 countries since early May [2022], and these numbers will rise rapidly with improved surveillance, access to diagnostics, and continuing global spread of infection. Although many tools are needed to control this unfolding pandemic, limiting ongoing spread will require a comprehensive international vaccination strategy and adequate supplies.

People 40 years old and younger who have not benefitted from the immunization campaign that eradicated smallpox by 1980 are now susceptible to monkeypox (which is in the same virus family as smallpox), and this lack of population immunity has contributed to the current outbreak. Most of the cases to date have occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly those with new or multiple partners.

Epidemiologic investigations indicate that the predominant mode of transmission is through skin-to-skin and sexual contact, not contact with contaminated clothing or bed linens. Although respiratory droplet transmission might occur, there is no evidence of airborne transmission as there is with COVID-19. And because monkeypox is a self-limited infection with symptoms lasting 2 to 4 weeks, there isn't a chronic carrier state as there is with HIV, which would increase the risk for ongoing transmission.

Although many tools are needed, it is clear that limiting ongoing spread will require widely available vaccination. The ACAM2000 vaccine is licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration for smallpox and allowed for use against monkeypox on an expanded access basis (so-called "compassionate use" for an investigational drug use). It is associated with potentially serious side effects. A newer vaccine with an improved safety profile was approved for monkeypox and smallpox in 2019. This 2-dose vaccine, produced by Bavarian Nordic, is a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA; Jynneos in the United States, Imvanex in the European Union, and Imamune in Canada). Its supply, however, is limited.

How can the world use these vaccines to control the spread of monkeypox? Transmission among MSM populations must be reduced through aggressive public health measures, including increased vaccination and diagnostic testing and extensive education campaigns targeted at populations at risk and minimizing social stigma. In addition to scaling up vaccine production, dose-sparing actions can be taken: administration of a single dose per person instead of 2 doses (or a 1st dose followed by a delayed 2nd dose when supplies allow) or intradermal (versus intramuscular) administration of a smaller dose. However, research will be needed to determine whether such dose-sparing approaches provide adequate immune protection.

To dampen the current outbreak will require vaccination of those at highest risk, with global estimates of the number of MSM ranging from 1% to 3%. The needed global vaccine supply just for MSM is similar to those considered for HIV oral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). It is estimated that by 2023, 2.4 million to 5.3 million people worldwide should receive PrEP.

Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease; thus, another critical step is to greatly reduce transmission of the virus from current rodent reservoirs and to prevent spillovers in areas of the world where monkeypox isn't endemic. Long-term control of monkeypox will require vaccinating as many as possible of the 327 million people 40 years of age and younger living in the 11 African countries where monkeypox is endemic in an animal (rodent) reservoir. This effort should include childhood vaccine programs. Surveillance will be needed to identify new animal reservoirs, which might be established in other countries as a result of infected humans inadvertently transmitting the virus to domestic rodents that have subsequent contact with wild rodents.

[6] WHO considering emergency
Date: Thu 21 Jul 2022

As the World Health Organization's emergency committee convened Thursday [21 Jul 2022] to consider for the 2nd time within weeks whether to declare monkeypox a global crisis, some scientists said the striking differences between the outbreaks in Africa and in developed countries will complicate any coordinated response.

African officials say they are already treating the continent's epidemic as an emergency. But experts elsewhere say the mild version of monkeypox in Europe, North America and beyond makes an emergency declaration unnecessary even if the virus can't be stopped. British officials recently downgraded their assessment of the disease, given its lack of severity.

"I remain concerned about the number of cases, in an increasing number of countries, that have been reported," WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the emergency committee as its meeting got under way. He said it was "pleasing" to note falling numbers of monkeypox cases in some countries but that the virus is still increasing elsewhere and that 6 countries reported their first infections last week.

Monkeypox has been entrenched for decades in parts of central and western Africa, where diseased wild animals occasionally infect people in rural areas in relatively contained epidemics. The disease in Europe, North America and beyond has circulated since at least May [2022] among gay and bisexual men. The epidemic in rich countries was likely triggered by sex at 2 raves in Spain and Belgium.

Some experts worry these and other differences could possibly deepen existing medical inequities between poor and wealthy nations.

There are now more than 15 000 monkeypox cases worldwide. While the United States, Britain, Canada and other countries have bought millions of vaccines, none have gone to Africa, where a more severe version of monkeypox has already killed more than 70 people. Rich countries haven't yet reported any monkeypox deaths.

"What's happening in Africa is almost entirely separate from the outbreak in Europe and North America," said Dr Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain's University of East Anglia who previously advised WHO on infectious diseases.

The UN health agency said this week that outside of Africa, 99% of all reported monkeypox cases are in men and of those, 98% are in men who have sex with other men. Still, the disease can infect anyone in close, physical contact with a monkeypox patient, regardless of their sexual orientation.

"In these very active gay sexual networks, you have men who really, really don't want people to know what they're doing and may not themselves always know who they are having sex with," Hunter said. Some of those men may be married to women or have families unaware of their sexual activity, which "makes contact tracing extremely difficult and even things like asking people to come forward for testing," Hunter said, explaining why vaccination may be the most effective way to shut down the outbreak.

That's probably not the case in Africa, where limited data suggest monkeypox is mainly jumping into people from infected animals. Although African experts acknowledge they could be missing cases among gay and bisexual men, given limited surveillance and stigmatization against LGBTQ people, authorities have relied on standard measures like isolation and education to control the disease.
