Thirteen people in Indonesia suspected of having bird flu have tested
negative for the feared disease, the country's health ministry said
Saturday [9 Aug 2008]. Experts from the World Health Organisation
(WHO) arrived Friday in the affected village in North Sumatra to help
investigate a possible outbreak after 3 people died, and the 13 were
admitted to hospital. "All specimens collected from suspect cases
have given negative results. They are all recovered," I Nyoman
Kandun, director general of the ministry's communicable diseases
department said on a text message.

Officials and residents in Asahan district in North Sumatra province
said villagers began showing symptoms of avian flu after a large
number of chickens died suddenly last week in Air Batu village. The
local husbandry office took preventive action this week by
slaughtering and burning some 400 chickens and ducks. The ministry,
which has stopped giving regular bird flu updates, announced earlier
this week that the human toll from avian influenza in Indonesia had
risen to 112 following the recent death of a 19-year-old man.

The deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has killed more than 240 people
worldwide since late 2003. The virus typically spreads from bird to
human through direct contact, but experts fear it could mutate into a
form easily transmissible between humans, with the potential to kill
millions in a pandemic.

[Contrary to a statement by local health officials on Wed 6 Aug 2008
(see ProMED-mail reference below), the suspected human cases of avian
H5N1 influenza in North Sumatra have not been confirmed by the
Indonesian Ministry of Health. The World Health Organisation
cumulative table of human cases still lists the number of confirmed
avian influenza fatalities in Indonesia as 110, rather than the 112
fatalities recorded by the Indonesian Ministry of Health.

Until further notice, ProMED-mail will not report suspected human
cases of avian influenza in Indonesia until they have been confirmed
by the Indonesian Ministry of Health.
