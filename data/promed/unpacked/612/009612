The Department of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health (MINSA) states this Friday [8 Jul 2022] that in the first 6 months of the year [2022] that 11 hantavirus [infection] cases have been registered in Los Santos province.

It was indicated that of all the reported cases, "6 are of the hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) and 4 are hantavirus fever (HF)."

The report [of cases] are from the districts of Tonosí (6), Los Santos (3), one in Las Tablas and the case of one patient was a resident of Macaracas but became infected in Tonosí.

The Los Santos Health Region exhorted the population to keep their residences clean, store grain in tanks that impede the entry of rodents, seal holes that could become burrows, and do not throw away food in the patios.

[Cases of hantavirus infection occur frequently in Los Santos province. There are 4 ProMED posts of cases in this province this year (2022; see the posts listed in the See Also section below). It would not be surprising if additional cases occur in this province in the remainder of 2022.

Although the above report and previous ones do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for these cases, an earlier WHO report indicates that Choclo is the hantavirus identified in those previous cases, based on genomic sequence analysis (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report mentioned above -- or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done -- was Choclo virus, which confirms the ProMED conclusion.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and the adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection. - Mod.TY
