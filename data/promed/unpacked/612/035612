---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Rioverde Valley is an important farming area of the San Luis
Potosi State in the north-central region of Mexico, where a variety
of horticultural crops (that is, tomato, pepper, cucumber, and
watermelon) are annually cultivated. In the summer of 2005, a number
of plants exhibiting a variety of symptoms, including leaf yellowing,
curling, and stunted growth, were observed in several tomato
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_ L.) fields. The presence of whiteflies
(_Bemisia tabaci_ Genn.) and the symptoms seemed to suggest a
begomoviral etiology.

Leaves of 12 symptomatic tomato plants and 7 plants of the weed
_Solanum rostratum_ growing in the same area were collected from
several fields throughout the Rioverde area and assessed for the
presence of begomoviruses (genus _Begomovirus_, family
_Geminiviridae_) by PCR [polymerase chain reaction]. Amplicons [DNA
products] of 1.4 kb [kilobasepairs] were derived from viral DNA-A
present in all examined _S. rostratum_ and tomato samples and were
analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Several
restriction fragment patterns were observed, indicating the
occurrence of different begomoviruses in the sampled fields.

Sequencing of amplicons derived from one _S. rostratum_ plant
revealed the concurrent presence of _Tomato severe leaf curl virus_
(ToSLCV) and a distinct virus displaying a high sequence identity
with _Tomato golden mottle virus_ from Guatemala (ToGMoV).
Restriction fragment patterns identical to that of the ToGMoV-like
isolate were found in 3 additional _S. rostratum_ plants and 5 tomato
samples. PCR products encompassing the complete DNA-A component of
ToGMoV were obtained from one tomato sample. The 2614-bp DNA-A
sequence of the Rioverde isolate displayed 93 percent sequence
identity with the Guatemalan isolate of ToGMoV.

In addition, a number of _B. tabaci_ specimens of unidentified
biotype were collected in one tomato field. PCR analysis of viral DNA
present in the whiteflies was carried out. One of the begomoviral
DNA-A genomes isolated from the whiteflies displayed 99 percent
sequence identity with the virus isolated from plants.

Previously, ToGMoV had been found only in Central America, but this
report considerably expands its known geographical distribution.

[Begomoviruses affect many economically important crops causing
symptoms often including leaf yellowing, distortion, stunting,
reduced plant vigour, and yield losses. Tomato is a host of a number
of these viruses, including for example species in the tomato leaf
curl and tomato yellow leaf curl viral clades. Begomoviruses are
transmitted by whitefly vectors and can often also be transmitted by
mechanical means and grafting. Whiteflies are widely distributed and
have a very wide host range of more than 600 plant species. Weed
species can serve as insect reservoirs making control difficult.
Whiteflies have been reported to transmit over 100 virus species,
including many begomoviruses, but also cause serious crop damage by
direct feeding.

Disease management of begomoviruses relies on control of the vector
and possible pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants. This has
occasionally caused problems with chemical residues on fruits. In
some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance are
available.

Both ToGMoV and ToSLCV have a bipartite genome (called DNA-A and
DNA-B in the report above). While ToSLCV strains have been reported
from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Cuba from both
tomato and cucumber, only one strain of ToGMoV from tomato from
Guatemala had been reported previously. In the item above, a 2nd
strain of ToGMoV is being reported as well as a 2nd natural host and
a new location for this virus. Furthermore, the finding of ToGMoV
sequences in _B. tabaci_ demonstrates that it is a vector of the new
strain. _B. tabaci_ is believed to be a species complex with a number
of recognised biotypes varying in their distribution and vector
activities.
