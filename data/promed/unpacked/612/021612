While more information about common symptomatology and mortality in fellow
swimmers would be helpful, a distinct possibility would be leptospirosis,
more so considering the location (stream, SE Asia, oil palms). Another
less likely one would be melioidosis. Other common exposures over the
previous days would be useful, such as environmental exposure (malaria) and
common meals (intoxication).
Look forward to more clues.

What about free-living amoeba (Naegleria fowleri) infection? The incubation
period of these cases is too short, but this could be a possibility! Check
in Manson's tropical diseases.
