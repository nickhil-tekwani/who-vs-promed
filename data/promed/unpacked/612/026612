[1] USA: potential for spread

The United States declared monkeypox a public health emergency last week, an effort to bolster the US response to contain the outbreak.

The virus continues to be largely transmitted among gay and bisexual men, but experts say the disease could spill over into other populations, especially due to vaccine shortages. Monkeypox is spread by contact with puss-filled sores and is rarely fatal.

Here is the state of monkeypox now and some other populations that US experts believe may be at risk:

Who is getting monkeypox now?

Last month [July 2022], the World Health Organization declared monkeypox a global public health emergency. So far, 80 countries where the virus is not endemic have reported 26 500 cases of monkeypox, according to a Reuters tally.

In the United States, 99.1% of US monkeypox cases occurred among those assigned the male sex at birth as of 25 Jul [2022], according to a technical report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Among male patients, 99% reported having sexual contact with other men.

About 38% of cases occurred in among white, non-Hispanic males. Another 26% were in Black males and 32% in Hispanic males.

The pattern of sexual transmission in men is not typical. In Africa, where monkeypox has been circulating since the 1970s, 60% of cases are in men, and 40% occur in women.

One reason may be that the virus appears to be "very efficiently transmitted through anal receptive intercourse and to some degree oral sex," said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease epidemiologist and an editor-at-large at Kaiser Health News.

Who else is at risk?

Although the current explosion of cases has occurred in men, experts say there is no biological reason the virus will remain largely within the community of men who have sex with men.

"We certainly know it's going to spread to family members and to other non-male partners that people have," said Dr. Jay Varma, director of the Cornell Center for Pandemic Prevention and Response. He said the virus could also spread through massage parlors or spas.

The real question, he said, is whether it spreads as efficiently in those groups as it does among close sexual networks of men who have sex with men.

Experts point to the way HIV spread as a possible indicator for where the virus will go next.

"My greatest fear is that as we try to contain this, it's going to seep along the fractures in our social geography and go where HIV did, and that's going into communities of color in the rural South," said Dr. Gregg Gonsalves, an associate professor of epidemiology at Yale University and a leading HIV/AIDS activist.

Those are places with limited infrastructure for testing, vaccines, and treatments.

Gounder is especially concerned about infections among Black women, who account for the largest share of new HIV infections in the United States, and already suffer significantly higher rates of maternal complications and deaths.

Who else might be at risk?

Other at-risk settings include college dormitories, health clubs, and sports teams.

Gounder is aware of some sports leagues that are preparing for possible infections, noting that sports such as wrestling involve close skin-to-skin contact.

Wrestling, football, rugby, and other sports teams have previously had outbreaks of the superbug MRSA, according to the CDC.

"I think it is something we need to be thinking about and prepared for," she said.

Employers may also need to start preparing. Gounder said some theaters in New York, for example, are considering how they might protect their workers from possible monkeypox infections through contact with shared costumes.

"We're still in the beginnings of that, but I am encouraged to see that some are already thinking about that."

[2] USA: vaccine dose splitting
Date: Thu 4 Aug 2022
Source: The Hill [edited]
https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/3588440-fda-considering-dividing-jynneos-doses-into-fifths-to-increase-vaccine-supply/


The Biden administration is considering splitting doses of the smallpox vaccine, which are being used to prevent monkeypox amid the current outbreak, into 5 smaller doses, the head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Thursday [4 Aug 2022].

FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said during a briefing that his agency was looking into possible solutions to increase the number of available doses of the Jyenneos vaccine. One of these proposed solutions is dividing the current doses into fifths.

"We're considering an approach for the current doses of Jynneos that would allow healthcare providers to use an existing one dose vial of the vaccine to administer a total of up to 5 separate doses," Califf said. "This approach, which we're referring to as dose-sparing, would change the method of administration for Jynneos, which is currently administered subcutaneously."

According to Califf, this proposed change would involve injecting the reduced Jynneos doses in between layers of skin, creating a "pocket" for the vaccine.

"There's some advantages to intradermal administration, including an improved immune response to the vaccine," Califf said. "It's important to note that overall safety and efficacy profile will not be sacrificed with this approach."

An FDA spokesperson told The Hill this change in the monkeypox vaccination strategy was being considered because it had become "clear to all of us that we would not meet current demand with the current supply."

"As we often do at FDA, we began exploring other scientifically feasible options. The identification of a clinical study that demonstrates that this approach could work has been particularly useful in informing how this might work without sacrificing the safety and efficacy of the vaccine," said the spokesperson.

If pursued, this new strategy would still involve 2 doses administered about 28 days apart.

James Krellenstein, co-founder of the LGBTQ+ healthcare advocacy group PrEP4All, noted on Twitter that the FDA's decision appeared to based on a 2015 study that looked into the immune response derived from a 1/5 dose of Jynneos administered intradermally compared to a full dose administered subcutaneously, which is when the shot is injected into the layer of fat beneath the skin.

The study, funded in part by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, found that an "equivalent immune response" between the 2 different forms of Jynneos administration.

Krellenstein wrote he was glad to see this decision being considered, saying his organization had suggested this strategy to federal officials multiple times.

https://www.paho.org/en/documents/epidemiological-update-monkeypox-children-adolescents-and-pregnant-women-4-august-2022


Between 1 Jan and 2 Aug 2022, a total of 25 022 confirmed cases, including 9 deaths, were reported from 83 Member States in 6 World Health Organization (WHO) Regions. The 9 fatal cases were reported in Brazil (1), India (1), Nigeria (3), Spain (2), and the Central African Republic (2).

During the last 7 days there was an increase of 33.5% and 70% in the number of reported cases globally and in the WHO Region of the Americas, respectively.

Of the reported cases for which information on age is available (n=16 969), 96 are among minors (<18 years old); of these, 61% are male. Regarding age, 51% (49 cases) are aged 11-17 years, and 26% (25 cases) are children aged 0-4 years. No deaths have been reported in these age groups. Of the 33 confirmed cases for which hospitalization data is available, 42% required hospitalization for isolation or treatment. None of the cases had any comorbidities.

[4] United Kingdom: cases plateau
Date: Fri 5 Aug 2022

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-monkeypox-case-numbers-begin-to-plateau


As of 4 Aug [2022], there are 2859 confirmed and highly probable case of monkeypox in the UK.

Analyses of the current UK outbreak shows that monkeypox continues to be transmitted primarily in interconnected sexual networks of gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). The median age of confirmed cases in the UK was 37 years old. In England, 73% are known to be London residents over the course of the outbreak.

In the past few weeks, there have been a small number of women confirmed to have monkeypox, but there is not enough evidence currently to suggest that there is sustained transmission outside of interconnected sexual networks: 22 cases in women have been identified, and 99% of all UK cases are male.

A small number of cases with no known travel history during their incubation period have been detected prior to 6 May [2022], pre-dating the previous 1st-known report of a monkeypox case in the UK. This is not unexpected given our understanding of the outbreak to date.

Dr Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections, UKHSA, said:

"While the most recent data suggests the growth of the outbreak has slowed, we cannot be complacent. Be vigilant of and check yourself for monkeypox symptoms, including rashes and blisters.

"If you are concerned that you may have monkeypox symptoms, take a break from events, meeting with friends, or having sexual contact. Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice.

"The smallpox vaccine is being offered to individuals at higher risk of coming into contact with monkeypox in order to offer them protection and to reduce the spread of disease."

The briefing now includes monkeypox genomic surveillance data from the UK. As is described globally, the majority of outbreak cases in the UK belong to a distinct genetic lineage (B.1) which has mutations of unknown significance when compared with the closest previously characterised monkeypox virus genomes.

UKHSA will continue to publish regular technical briefings as the response to the outbreak continues.

[5] India (Delhi): female case
Date: Wed 3 Aug 2022

https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/trends/story/delhi-reports-4th-monkeypox-case-as-31-year-old-nigerian-woman-tests-positive-343634-2022-08-03


Delhi reported its 4th case of monkeypox on Wednesday [3 Aug 2022] with a 31-year-old Nigerian woman testing positive for the disease, official sources said.

With this case, India's tally of monkeypox infections has gone up to 9. She is the 1st woman in India to test positive for monkeypox.

The woman has fever and skin lesions and is admitted to Lok Nayak Jai Prakash (LNJP) Hospital, sources said, adding her samples were sent for testing and the results came positive on Wednesday [3 Aug 2022].

There is no information about her travelling abroad recently, sources said.

The 1st monkeypox patient in Delhi was discharged on Monday [1 Aug 2022] from the LNJP hospital.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) recently declared monkeypox a global public health emergency of international concern.

According to the global health body, monkeypox is a viral zoonosis -- a virus transmitted to humans from animals -- with symptoms similar to smallpox although clinically less severe.

The disease typically manifests itself with fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes and may lead to a range of medical complications. It is usually a self-limited disease with symptoms lasting for 2-4 weeks.

The 'Guidelines on Management of Monkeypox Disease' issued by the Centre stated that human-to-human transmission occurs primarily through large respiratory droplets generally requiring prolonged close contact.

It can also be transmitted through direct contact with body fluids or lesions, and indirect contact with lesion material such as through contaminated clothing or linen of an infected person. Animal-to-human transmission may occur by bite or scratch of infected animals or through bush meat preparation.

Thailand has now found 4 monkeypox patients, including the 1st Thai woman last Friday [5 Aug 2022]. Given the apparent rise in infections, the Ministry of Public Health has come under pressure to formulate control.

The 1st monkeypox case was confirmed on 21 Jul [2022] in Phuket with a 27-year-old Nigerian man, followed by a 47-year-old Thai man on 28 Jul [2022] in Bangkok. The infection of a 25-year-old German man was confirmed on 3 Aug [2022].

The ministry believes more cases are likely to emerge in Thailand but says spread of the disease is likely to be much less extensive than for COVID-19.

The Nigerian man who fled from Thailand to Cambodia who was infected with monkeypox has been successfully treated and discharged from the hospital in Phnom Penh on the morning of 6 Aug [2022], Ministry of Health spokeswoman Or Vandine confirmed.

The patient was apprehended in Phnom Penh on 23 Aug [2022] one day after he had fled from Thailand following a lab confirmation that he was positive for monkeypox infection.

Vandine said in a media statement today that the patient, who was treated for the disease at the Khmer-Soviet hospital, was discharged this morning with a negative test result for the virus as confirmed by the Pasteur Institute Laboratory on 5 Aug [2022].

"Currently, this person has already been handed over to the authorities to continue with any legal procedures decided by the authorities.

"This is meant to inform the public to be careful and continue to implement the preventive measures to protect yourself from the spread of monkeypox by following the guidance issued in the press release of the Ministry of Health on 5 Aug 2022," Vandine said.

Dr Prince Quarshie, the acting deputy director in charge of public health at the Bono Regional Health Directorate, says the region has recorded a confirmed case of monkeypox disease out of 6 suspected cases.

The suspected cases were recorded in 4 districts, while the confirmed case was one of 2 results received. The results of the other 4 tests are still pending, Dr Quashie told the Ghana News Agency.

He said, "Monkeypox is an infectious viral disease which is spread from infected animals such as monkeys, squirrels, and grass cutters" and could also be transmitted from infected humans with close contact.

Dr Quarshie said the 4 patients were in isolation pending the outcome of the results.

He explained that in suspected cases entire members of a household were kept in isolation until the release of the result, because non-infected occupants could also be infected through contact with affected persons' bed sheets, towels, clothing, and other objects.

He said people could be infected through hunting and handling of infected meats, while human transmission could also occur through exposure to infected body fluids, blood, and contaminated objects by droplets.

Dr Quarshie advised the general public to report to the hospital on time in case of suspected ill feeling, particularly with symptoms of skin rashes, fever, cough, severe headache, joint pains, and severe muscle pain.

He urged the populace to avoid handshaking and getting closer to sick people and to practice regular handwashing with soap under running water, social distancing, and compliance with and adherence to all other COVID-19 preventive and safety protocols to help prevent the spread of the disease.

[9] Africa: not concentrated among gay men
Date: Thu 4 Aug 2022
Source: Reuters [abridged, edited]
https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/african-monkeypox-cases-not-concentrated-among-gay-men-experts-say-2022-08-04/


Monkeypox outbreaks in Africa are not concentrated among gay men, unlike in other parts of the world, experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Africa CDC said on Thursday [4 Aug 2022].

Outbreaks of the viral disease have been reported from 78 countries, mostly in Europe, and 98% of cases outside the countries in Africa where it is endemic have been reported in men who have sex with men, the WHO says.

But in Africa, where repeated outbreaks have been documented since the 1970s, the pattern of transmission is different, the experts said.

"Currently 60% of the cases that we have -- the 350 -- 60% are men, 40% are women," said epidemiologist Dr Otim Patrick Ramadan, who was answering questions on monkeypox at a media briefing organised by the WHO's regional office in Africa, and who was referring to the continent's number of current cases.

He said that more than 80% of cases in Africa were in countries where transmission had happened before, and that typically people were initially exposed to the virus through contact with animals carrying it, before passing it to household members.

He added that women typically took care of sick people at home, which was one of the factors in the spread among women.

Dr Ahmed Ogwell Ouma, acting director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told a separate media briefing there was no evidence that transmission among gay men was a specific factor in African outbreaks.

"We've been collecting data on monkeypox since 1970, and that particular indicator, men having sex with men, has never come up as a significant issue here in Africa," he said.

Monkeypox spreads via close contact and tends to cause flu-like symptoms and pus-filled skin lesions.

Public health agencies have stressed that although in many countries the outbreaks are concentrated among men who have sex with men, anyone can contract the virus through prolonged close contact or from particles on items such as bedding or towels.

[10] Europe: unusual lesions
Date: Wed 3 Aug 2022
Source: Mirror [edited]
https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/new-monkeypox-symptoms-identified-pseudo-27644785


Cases of monkeypox are continuing to rise globally, with 2 new deaths being recorded in Europe.

While typical signs of the disease include a rash, fever, and swollen lymph nodes, the most recent review of 185 cases -- published in the British Journal Dermatology [see citation below]-- has identified a new skin symptom related to the illness.

Dr Ignacio García Doval, coordinator of the research from the Spanish Academy of Dermatology, said: " Our research shows that the symptoms of the current outbreak are unusual, and there is evidence that this is due to skin-to-skin contact during sex."

He added: "Rather than the typical widespread rash seen in past cases, recent cases tend to have far fewer skin lesions, often in one location."

Here's what you need to know about pseudo-pustules, the new monkeypox skin symptom identified by experts.

What are monkeypox pseudo-pustules?

Monkeypox, which comes from the same family of viruses causing smallpox, is often described as causing pustules, which are pus-filled lesions.

However, medics have spotted a new sign appearing on the skin in the most recent monkeypox outbreak: pseudo-pustules.

Pseudo-pustules are similar in appearance to pustules, except they are white and solid and don't actually contain any pus.

While the top layer of typical pustules can be scraped off to get to the pus inside, that's not possible with the pseudo-pustules. This means that lesions from pseudo-pustules can lead to ulcers.

This symptom is important to note, with experts warning that there are very few diseases that produce this type of reaction.

People who have been infected with monkeypox typically develop symptoms such as fever, sore muscles, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, and sweating.

A distinct rash breaks out between 1 and 4 days of infections, with lesions developing mostly over the face as well as over the palms, soles, and mucosa (the moist, inner lining of the nose and mouth).

These lesions generally scab over and fall off, and the infections resolve within 2-4 weeks.
