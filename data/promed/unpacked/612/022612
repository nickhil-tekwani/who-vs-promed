Meat presumably infected with "anthrax", has been sold in the "East" market of Krasnooktyabrskiy region of Volgograd. According to the press service of the governor of the region, the regional law enforcement agencies, health monitoring services, and the veterinary department are investigating. Suspicion of the dangerous infectious disease occurred after the owner of a private farm in Molokanovsky village, Ilmensky Oktyabrsky district, was hospitalized with a preliminary diagnosis of "anthrax." It seems that the man in violation of the rules concerning the use of slaughterhouses, butchered an animal at home for subsequent sale in the "East", market without providing the proper documents to the market dealers. The meat was seized and sent for examination, and law enforcement agencies are trying to find who might have bought this contaminated meat, and how this all came about.

The Ministry of Health has reported that the affected farmer is not in a critical condition. All that is needed to treat anthrax is available to Volgograd physicians, and cutaneous anthrax is considered to be completely curable. The last time that human anthrax was reported in the Volgograd region was in 2010 in a settlement in Surovikinskogo district.

The Russian oblasts are a long way from Moscow and therefore official reporting is problematic, quite apart from their predilection for reporting only outbreaks that involve human cases. For example, one outbreak in Volgograd (Vodno-Buerachnay, Kamyshinski district) only diagnosed after the sick cow's owner and the slaughterman were hospitalised; the carcass had by then been converted to sausages. There was a single bovine case reported in Volgograd in 2010. Logically there will have been significantly more livestock outbreaks, with and without human cases, in the other years, and since. And in this instance we must await laboratory confirmation. Our thanks to Sabine for this report. - Mod.MHJ]
