Even as health officials and food distributors zeroed in yesterday, 7
Dec 2006, on a California farm as the possible source of the
contaminated green onions that have sickened Taco Bell customers, the
_E. coli_ outbreak widened considerably, with cases reported for the
1st time in New York City, Delaware, South Carolina and Utah.
In all, the number of cases that have been reported ballooned, to at
least 169 by 7 Dec 2006, with most concentrated on Long Island and in
New Jersey.
In New York, health officials said they were investigating 103
confirmed or suspected cases in 10 counties, up from 49 on Wed, 6 Dec
2006. Nearly 3/4 of the cases were found on Long Island, but cases
were reported for the 1st time in New York City as well as
Westchester, Rockland, St. Lawrence and Herkimer Counties.
In New Jersey, 12 new cases were reported, bringing the total to 55.
There were no new cases reported in Pennsylvania, where 7 people have
been sickened thus far. In Delaware, one case was confirmed and
another was suspected. According to federal health officials, "the
vast majority of patients reported eating" at a Taco Bell.
As the list of those sickened by the dangerous _E. coli_ O157:H7
grew, the focus of the investigation turned to Boskovich Farms in
Oxnard, CA, which grows the green onions, also known as scallions,
for the supplier of Taco Bell.
For now, the outbreak has led Taco Bell to remove the green onions
from its 5800 restaurants nationwide while the company and health
officials try to determine where along the supply chain the bacteria
spread. "We're focused on working with the authorities to find the
root cause," said Rob Poetsch, a spokesman for Yum! Foods, which owns
Taco Bell.
Laboratory tests performed yesterday by the New York State Health
Department in Albany showed that the same virulent strain of the
bacteria -- which can lead to bloody diarrhea, anemia and, in some
cases, kidney failure -- was present in patients who ate at
restaurants on Long Island, in Clinton County in upstate New York and
in Delaware.
But for now, the foremost question was where the problem started. It
is still unclear whether the green onions were contaminated at
Boskovich Farms in California, where they were grown; at the Ready
Pac Produce plant in Florence, NJ, where they were cut, washed and
sanitized; or at the huge warehouse of McLane Foodservice in
Burlington Township, NJ, which then distributed the vegetables and
other ingredients to the Taco Bell outlets in 8 northeastern states.
Boskovich, which began growing green onions on its farms 40 years
ago, provided the green onions that led to a hepatitis outbreak that
began at a Chi-Chi's restaurant in Pennsylvania in 2003.
As the number of cases of _E. coli_ continued to grow, so did
complaints about oversight of the nation's food supply. "Because we
have more industrialized systems now where things are concentrated,
we need more tracking of produce," said Michael Hansen, a senior
scientist at Consumers Union, a consumer advocacy group. "You'll
continue to see these types of outbreaks until people start looking
at the whole food chain to find out where this is happening."
The pre-trimmed green onions produced by Boskovich travel by
refrigerated truck over several days to Ready Pac's sprawling
vegetable processing plant in New Jersey, the sole location for the
processing of green onions used in Taco Bells in New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and parts of New York.
"Taco Bell is the only customer to whom we sell green onions from
this plant," said Steve Dickstein, a vice president for marketing at
Ready Pac. "But it is less than 1 percent of our output at this plant."
Mr. Dickstein said yesterday, 7 Dec 2006, that the FDA had inspected
the facility in mid-Nov 2006 and issued it a clean bill of health.
But as a precaution, the company shut down the production line where
the onions are prepared.
Ordinarily, Mr. Dickstein said, the onions are placed on a conveyor
belt, where they are washed in a chlorine solution to kill
contaminants. He said that workers wear rubber gloves, rubber boots,
head coverings and face masks when necessary. "There is no human skin
contact allowed," he said.
The onions are then rinsed with water as they move along the belt and
pass through a series of blades that trim the onions to roughly
quarter-inch squares for Taco Bell. They are then bathed again in the
sanitizing liquid and rinsed with water.
Once dry, the onions are put in 24-ounce bags that are not airtight,
but are stamped and coded to indicate their production run and
expiration date. The coding, Mr. Dickstein said, lets the company
trace a product back to its origin at Boskovich.
Bags are then packed 4 to a carton and shipped to McLane distribution
centers in Burlington, NJ, and Albany, NY, he said, adding that
workers never opened the boxes. The boxes then travel in
refrigerated trailers to Taco Bell restaurants in the region, usually
twice a week.
Bart McKay, a lawyer for McLane, said, "Since mid- to late Nov 2006,
we would have turned over our entire inventory a dozen times."

As of 1 PM (ET), Thu, 7 Dec 2006, 58 cases associated with this
outbreak have been reported to CDC from 6 states: New York (19), New
Jersey (28), Pennsylvania (8), Delaware (1), South Carolina (1), and
Utah (1). Other cases of _E. coli_ O157 infection are under
investigation by state public health officials. The vast majority of
patients reported eating at a particular fast-food restaurant chain,
Taco Bell. No specific food has been implicated yet.
Among the ill persons, 48 (83 percent) were hospitalized and 7 (12
percent) developed a type of kidney failure called hemolytic-uremic
syndrome (HUS). Illness onset dates have ranged from 20 Nov to 2 Dec
2006. The risk to the public is considered ongoing and we expect
additional cases to be identified in the coming days.
Several laboratories are testing food samples from Taco Bell
restaurants. Some tests have indicated the possible presence of _E.
coli_ O157 in samples of green onions. These results are considered
preliminary and unconfirmed because additional tests, such as
cultures, are needed to confirm the presence of _E. coli_ O157.
_E. coli_ O157 strains are routinely 'DNA fingerprinted' at public
health laboratories in all states as part of PulseNet (the network of
public health laboratories that sub-type bacteria). Strains from some
patients in this outbreak have been 'fingerprinted,' and the analysis
shows that the strains have matching 'fingerprints,' indicating they
may come from the same source. Fingerprints from other patients are
being submitted to and analyzed by PulseNet. These results will help
to determine the extent of the outbreak.
CDC is working with state and local health officials, FDA, USDA, and
the fast food chain to investigate the outbreak and to help take
action to protect the public.
