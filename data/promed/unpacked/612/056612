[The location of the described outbreak can be seen on the map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.

Jiangsu is the 3rd Chinese province reporting a new outbreak of FMD serotype O during 2013. Earlier in 2013, this virus strain was reportedly involved in (3) outbreaks in Xinjiang and one in Tibet. A previous "old" epizootic which had started in Feb 2013, reportedly has caused at least 6 outbreaks spread over 5 provinces throughout China; its spread can be seen in the map at the bottom of the summarising report http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013082_20130301_163730.pdf>.

It causes clinicaldisease in bovine and porcine animals. Vaccination against FMDV-O has been widely applied, and the outbreak was declared as "resolved" on 2 May 2013 (but 3 new outbreaks have been reported).

Besides serotype O, a "new" strain for China, namely serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype/strain SEA 97, has been circulating in China since the beginning of 2013. This strain has already penetrated into the Russian Federation; a recent outbreak in Kazakhstan, on China's (Xinjiang) border, might have been caused by the same A strain but its serotyping is, reportedly, still pending.- Mod.AS.]
