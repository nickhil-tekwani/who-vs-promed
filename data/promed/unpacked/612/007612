The emergence of this apparently more virulent strain of PRRSV in
China is interesting. When I was working at the Tai Lung Veterinary
Laboratory of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Dept in
Hong Kong a few years ago, there was early evidence of this variant
strain emerging in the region. PRRS-associated disease was commonly
diagnosed in Hong Kong pigs by pathology and RT-PCR. When I started
there about 5 years ago, most cases typed genetically as the EU
strain or the US strain, which were the only strains described. By
the time I finished 3 years later, more and more cases failed to type
as either EU or US strain, and some differences in the pathology were
also emerging.

The typical case presentation of EU and US strains was low but steady
and with ongoing mortalities in grower pigs, with poor performance of
the herd overall. PM cases consistently showed moderate sub-lethal
interstitial pneumonia that contained the virus, which was
demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Lymphoid depletion in bronchial
lymph nodes was probably present but debatable. Death was almost
always attributable to secondary bacterial pneumonia. The variant
cases of non-EU, non-US PRRS often showed the same findings, but some
cases also included mortality in much younger weaner pigs, with acute
haemorrhage into the lungs, severe lymphoid depletion in bronchial
lymph nodes, only early mild interstitial pneumonia, and no secondary
bacterial involvement. The cause of death appeared to be entirely
attributable to acute PRRSV infection.

Unfortunately, the cases were not followed up with definitive
sequence data and a publication because pig farms were on the way out
in Hong Kong, and the research was not considered a priority by
management. However, I believe there was enough evidence then to be
convincing of a new genetic variant of PRRSV with the potential to
emerge as a new virulent phenotype and a new wave of acute disease
with higher mortalities that would take us back to the days of "blue
ear disease." I think that is what we are now seeing in China.

[Dr Chadwick's firsthand contribution is gratefully acknowledged. It
adds valuable detail to the gradually unfolding picture of the PRRS
epizootic in China (and, apparently, Viet Nam).

ProMED-mail's subscribers have been following the evolvement of the
major PRRS epizootic in China since mid 2006 and in Viet Nam since
spring 2007. The reporting from China was initially based upon
reports and advisory articles for farmers indicating heavy economical
losses and soaring pork prices, which appeared in local media and
farmers journals, initially addressing the condition as "Pig High
Fever Disease". It appeared that the syndrome may had been affecting
the pig population in south China "during the hot and humid season"
of earlier years as well (see 20060908.2549).

Following ProMED-mail's 3 RFI's, China submitted a report to the OIE
on 14 Sep 2006, describing the syndrome as "mixed infection of
classical swine fever, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
and porcine circovirus," which affected the pig industry in 6
provinces (see posting 20060924.2732). In the early summer of 2007,
the syndrome renewed its spread; on 9 May 2007, China notified the
OIE that "based on the experience of the similar epidemic (which)
occurred in 2006 in China, which was notified to the OIE on 12 Sep
2006, this case is probably caused by highly pathogenic PRRS virus.
The laboratory diagnosis is ongoing".

The 1st scientific paper on the PRRS epizootic in China, titled
"Emergence of Fatal PRRSV Variants: Unparalleled Outbreaks of
Atypical PRRS in China and Molecular Dissection of the Unique
Hallmark," was published in the June 2007 issue of PLoS (Public
Library of Science) ONE, available free at
<http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1885284>
(see posting 20070622.2017).

Among other things, the authors, Tian et al, stated that the
"unparalleled large-scale outbreaks" spread to "more than 10
provinces (autonomous cities or regions) and affected over 2 million
pigs with about 400 000 fatal cases". Furthermore, the authors
stated: "Whole-genome analysis of the isolated viruses revealed that
these PRRSV isolates are grouped into Type II and are highly
homologous to HB-1, a Chinese strain of PRRSV (96.5 percent
nucleotide identity). More importantly, we observed a unique
molecular hallmark in these viral isolates, namely a discontinuous
deletion of 30 amino acids in nonstructural protein 2 (NSP2). Taken
together, this is the 1st comprehensive report documenting the 2006
epidemic of atypical PRRS outbreak in China and identifying the 30
amino-acid deletion in NSP2, a novel determining factor for virulence
which may be implicated in the high pathogenicity of PRRSV".

In November 2008, Feng et al published their paper "Porcine
respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus variants, Viet Nam and
China, 2007" in the monthly Emerging Infectious Diseases, Volume 14 ,
Issue 11, pages 1774-1776 (available on line at
<http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/14/11/pdfs/1774.pdf>). The abstract
says: "We characterized isolates from porcine respiratory and
reproductive syndrome virus epidemics in Viet Nam and China in 2007.
These isolates showed 99 percent identity at the genomic level.
Genetic analysis indicated that they share a discontinuous deletion
of 30 aa in nonstructural protein 2, which indicates that identical
variants emerged in Viet Nam and China," a remarkable coincidence.

According to information, gathered from various Chinese sources by
ProMED-mail's Rapporteur Dan Silver in February 2008, there were 11
approved suppliers of inactivated highly pathogenic PRRS vaccine in
China, well-scattered geographically, and one approved supplier of a
live vaccine. All inactivated vaccines were approved in 2007 under a
special measure issued by the Ministry of Agriculture (see posting
20080208.0512). - Mod.AS]
