The U.N. Children's Fund says a meningitis outbreak in Rwanda continues to
threaten the lives of 2 million people and may spread to Kigali endangering
another million people. Nearly 700 cases of the disease have been
confirmed, with 83 deaths.
The meningitis epidemic is coming under control in some areas of Rwanda,
thanks to a mass vaccination campaign UNICEF and its partners are running.
But UNICEF spokeswoman Wivina Belmonte says meningitis is reaching new
areas because it is easily spread. She says aid workers are particularly
concerned that the epidemic might travel from the town of Bugasera to the
capital, Kigali, which is just 30 kilometers away.
"There are a lot of people who ... take buses in to work in the capital,"
she said. "Now we have done an all-out effort in Bugasera, vaccinating
everyone that is [age] 6 months up to every adult that we can find. We
think we have blanketed the coverage. We certainly hope so. We can
vaccinate people and protect them through the vaccinations."
UNICEF has already provided more than 650 000 doses of vaccine to Rwanda,
and a new shipment of 250 000 doses has just arrived. But the agency says
it needs to purchase still more vaccine, and it needs $2 million to pay for
it. The additional vaccine will provide protection for the 2 million
people most at risk in Rwanda.

A vaccination campaign will begin early next week for refugees in the camps
in Kibondo district, Kibondo province as well as for those refugees
registered for repatriation to the northern provinces in Burundi (see
previous report:
<http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news/n2002/september/4september2002.html>).

It will be carried out by the International Rescue Committee, supported by
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
Surveillance is also being strengthened in Kasulo province, which borders

Refugees fleeing war in Burundi are the source of a bacterial meningitis
outbreak in northwestern Tanzania, a government minister said. Health
Minister Anna Abdallah said she did not have more details about the outbreak.
"We are doing what we can to contain the disease there," she said.
State-run Radio Tanzania reported on Thu 5 Sep 2002, that at least 24
people have died of meningitis recently. The radio station did not give the
nationalities of the dead, but said a total of 117 cases were recorded in
the past 2 weeks.
At least one million Burundian refugees fleeing the almost 10-year-old war
in their home country live in northwestern Tanzania.
