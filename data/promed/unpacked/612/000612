Health officials at Malawi's Lilongwe district are reportedly on high alert following the high prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases, which have hit at least 9000 young people in the last 4 months, reports Nyasa Times.

Spokesperson for the Lilongwe district health office (DHO), Richard Mvula, said that most of the "affected" people in the district were suffering from gonorrhoea and syphilis. He said that the most vulnerable group were young girls, between the ages of 19 and 25 [years].

In a previous report, the Nyasa Times revealed that a small tea town in southern Malawi, Tyholo [Thyolo?], had an HIV prevalence of at least 18 percent. Officials in Tyholo claimed that the majority of young people in the area were engaging in unsafe sexual intercourse, which resulted in unsafe abortions and HIV.

Mvula further claimed that a nearby hospital was running out of "important" drugs meant to treat the patients.

[Malawi, with an estimated population of 16 777 547 in 2013, is a landlocked country in southeast Africa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawi). About 80 percent of the population lives in rural areas engaged in subsistence farming. Lilongwe, located in the central region of Malawi, is the largest and capital city of Malawi with an estimated population of about 1 million people in 2015 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilongwe). Thyolo, a town with a population of about 7000, located in the Southern Region of Malawi, is the administrative capital of Thyolo District (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyolo). A map of Malawi showing its geographical location in relation to its neighbors can be found at http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/malawi_map.htm.

Attesting to the infrequent use of condoms is the high prevalence of HIV infection in Malawi. HIV prevalence in Malawi was reported to be 10 percent in adults 15-49 years old, and 1 million adults and children were living with HIV in 2014; the most important mode of HIV transmission in Malawi is unprotected heterosexual sex (http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/malawi). HIV/AIDS is reported to be the leading cause of death in the most productive age group, resulting in an estimated 86 000 deaths among adults and children annually (http://www.who.int/hiv/HIVCP_MWI.pdf). The HIV prevalence is almost twice as high in urban areas (25 percent) as in rural areas (13 percent) in 2004 (http://www.who.int/hiv/HIVCP_MWI.pdf). - Mod.ML
