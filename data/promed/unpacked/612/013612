[The initial, "immediate notification" on this outbreak was submitted
by Greece to the OIE on 7 Nov 2008 (see posting 20081109.3520). At
that stage the isolated BT virus was untyped, prompting ProMED-mail's
comment "the serotyping of the BTV strain(s) involved are awaited
with interest." This request was addressed in early December 2008
when the Greek Authorities announced that the outbreak in Lesvos was
caused by BTV-16, returning after about 7 years of absence. All
necessary measures were taken in accordance with Council Directive
2000/75/EC, the whole territory of Lesvos considered to be restricted
zone. More details can be found in the presentation given by the
Greek authorities during the 2-3 Dec 2008 EU standing committee
(scfcah) meeting in Brussels; see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/bt_23122008_el.pdf>.

The reported apparent morbidity rate is strikingly low (2.51 percent)
but the case-fatality rate is 20 percent, also rather low though
closer to the general picture seen elsewhere. The possibility that
apparently unaffected sheep, as well as cattle and goats, have been
subclinically infected deserved to be investigated; this can be done
serologically. Information on the sheep breed affected will be useful
as well (Chios sheep are known to be susceptible).

The possible further spread of BTV16 during the 2009 season (starting
June), probably in westward and northward directions, deserves to be
kept in mind. Preparation of an inactivated BTV-16 vaccine deserves
to be considered.

The Greek Island Lesvos is close to the Turkish mainland, from where,
most probably, infected vectors (or, though less likely, infected
ruminants) have been introduced. The virus may have been circulating
for some time in the region, particularly in Turkey, without being
noticed. - Mod.AS]
