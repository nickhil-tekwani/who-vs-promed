The Federation of Fruit Producers expressed its concern about the threat that prunus necrotic spot virus poses for the Chilean cherry industry. It could cause the loss of plantations and affect international trade, for example with China. The virus incidence in the country is still being studied. It is continuously found in fruits, but does not always cause symptoms.

Producers need to be trained to recognise infected trees and carry out tests to stop its spread. Since there is currently no method to treat affected trees, producers should remove those that show any symptoms. It is recommended to keep orchards in good sanitary conditions. The ultimate goal is to eradicate the disease as soon as possible.

[_Prunus necrotic ringspot virus_ (PNRSV; genus _Ilarvirus_) infects a wide range of fruit trees of genus _Prunus_ such as peach, nectarine, apricot, plum, cherry, as well as a number of hosts in other genera including hops, cucumber, and roses. A range of necrotic diseases with various names are caused by PNRSV, for example, apricot necrotic ringspot, cherry tatter leaf, plum line pattern, and peach ringspot. Different viral strains show different levels of virulence. Symptoms may include chlorotic line patterns and ringspots on leaves which may lead to tissue necrosis ('shotholes'); ringspots, line patterns, and distortions on fruit; shoot dieback; and stunting of trees. Infection may also lead to bud necrosis and severely reduce the success of budwood grafting in nurseries. PNRSV may occur in co-infection with other fruit tree viruses, for example _Prune dwarf virus_ (PDV; genus _Ilarvirus_).

PNRSV is transmitted by seed and pollen (both to the seed and the mother plant) at varying rates depending on the host and viral strains. Bees carry infected pollen between trees during pollination, therefore spread occurs mostly during flowering. The virus can also be spread easily by mechanical means (including contaminated pruning tools) and grafting. Even though other ilarviruses such as PDV and _Tobacco streak virus_ can be transmitted by thrips, a specific insect vector for PNRSV has not been identified so far, despite much research. Disease management in orchards mainly relies on phytosanitation and use of certified disease-free planting and grafting material.
