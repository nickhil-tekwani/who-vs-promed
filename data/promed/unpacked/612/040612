West Nile Virus-positive Crows Detected in New Jersey
-----------------------------------------------------
2 crows have tested positive for West Nile virus in New Jersey. The 2 dead
crows were turned in for testing on 30 Apr 2001 from Bergen County (Upper
Saddle River) and on 1 May 2001 [2 May 2001 in other reports. - Mod from
Middlesex County (Edison Township). Both these counties showed high crow
mortality last year. It should be noted that American and Fish Crows are
now sitting on eggs in their nests and have been doing so since early
April. This means that they are NOT using communal roosts and are not
likely to have traveled far from their territory.

Two Dead Crows Test Positive for WNV in New Jersey
--------------------------------------------------
TRENTON: Dead crows found in 2 New Jersey communities have tested positive
for West Nile virus (WNV), authorities said on Mon 7 May 2001. The counties
where the crows were found, Bergen and Middlesex, are both increasing their
surveillance for mosquitoes. The state plans to spend about $7 million in
the fiscal year that begins 1 Jul 2001 to fight the virus. State health
officials said people should use insect repellent, wear long pants and
long-sleeved shirts when outdoors and try to stay inside at dawn and in the
evening, when mosquitoes are most active.

Two Dead Crows in New Jersey Herald the Re-emergence of WNV in 2001
-------------------------------------------------------------------
New Jersey health officials have identified 2 crows infected with West Nile
virus (WNV) in what is believed to be the first occurrence [confirmation
of the disease [infection this season in the New York metropolitan region.
The infected crows were among 22 dead birds found in two-thirds of the
state's counties, said a spokesman for the state Department of Health and
Senior Services in Trenton.
One of the infected crows was found on 30 April 2001 at Upper Saddle River,
in Bergen County, in the northern part of the state. The other was found on
2 May 2001 at Edison, in Middlesex County, in the central part of the state.
Since 1999, when the virus was detected for the first time in the Western
Hemisphere, in New York, states in the region have increased their
surveillance for the mosquitoes that pass the infection to birds and
humans. Last year in New Jersey there were 6 cases in humans, resulting in
one death. Bob Kent, director of the state office of Mosquito Control
Coordination, said most counties in New Jersey had been on the alert since
March, conducting surveillance of adult mosquitoes and their larvae and
trying to eliminate areas of standing water where mosquitoes might breed.
Testing dead birds has been adopted as the best early-warning system for
detecting the virus in the area, he said. The positive results for the 2
crows will lead Middlesex and Bergen Counties to intensify their
surveillance of the adult mosquito population. Only if that effort turns up
more infected mosquitoes, officials said, will they consider local
spraying. The strategy was controversial last year.

Tests Confirm West Nile Virus in Two Crows
------------------------------------------
TRENTON: Of 22 birds tested so far this season by the New Jersey Department
of Health and Senior Services, 2 crows found in Upper Saddle River (Bergen
County) and Edison (Middlesex) have tested positive for the presence of the
West Nile virus (WNV), Health and Senior Services Commissioner Christine
Grant announced today. The department's Public Health and Environmental
Laboratories performed the testing, confirming the positive results over
the weekend. The 21 crows and one hawk submitted for testing so far this
season came from 14 counties around the state.
The acting Governor said that the state has a comprehensive, statewide
response plan in place that will help provide residents with the best
protection possible. "Additional state and federal funding this year will
enable us to take a more aggressive approach in the prevention,
surveillance and testing for the virus," he added. "The most effective way
for residents to avoid West Nile virus is to take steps to reduce their
risk of being bitten by a mosquito," said Commissioner Grant. "This
includes using insect repellent according to labeling directions and
wearing pants and long-sleeved shirts when outdoors. Residents can also
curb outdoor activities at dawn, dusk and during the evening. New Jerseyans
should also check for clogged gutters and other sources of standing water
on your property, and take steps to eliminate these potential mosquito
breeding sites," the Commissioner said.
Today's testing results have been posted on a new state West Nile virus
resource web page accessible through the New Jersey home page at
. The site, designed and maintained by the New Jersey
Office of Information Technology, contains West Nile virus information,
testing results and helpful links. Health and Senior Services is the lead
agency on West Nile virus (WNV), working with the departments of
Agriculture and Environmental Protection, state and county mosquito control
commissions, Rutgers University, and local health officials. Earlier this
year, state officials unveiled New Jersey's strategic plan for detecting
and responding to the re-emergence of WNV. The plan includes increased
mosquito control activities, and increased human, animal and mosquito
surveillance and testing, so those working to control the virus can more
effectively determine its intensity, geographic spread and impact.
West Nile virus, an arboviral disease, is transmitted through the bite of a
mosquito that has picked up the virus by feeding on an infected bird. WNV
is not directly transmitted from birds or horses to humans, from horse to
horse, or from person to person. In people, West Nile generally causes no
symptoms or just mild, flu-like symptoms; however, the elderly are at
higher risk of more severe disease. Similarly, infected horses may not show
any symptoms of the disease. When they do appear, symptoms may include the
animal being "off his feed," or exhibiting neurological abnormalities.
In 2000, a total of 6 New Jersey residents became ill and one died due to
WNV infection. The virus was also detected in mosquitoes, horses, crows and
other birds in 20 of the state's 21 counties. The virus was detected for
the first time in the Western Hemisphere in September 1999, in birds found
in New York City and Westchester County.
