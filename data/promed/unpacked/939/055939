Malaria situation as of Fri 9 Feb 2007
---------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Jamaica has confirmed 280 cases of malaria
due to _Plasmodium falciparum_ on the island between 6 Nov 2006 and 3
Feb 2007. Of these reported cases, 264 have occurred in Kingston, 12
in St. Catherine, 3 in St. Thomas, and one in Clarendon. There have
been no reported deaths due to malaria.

The Ministry of Health is receiving technical cooperation from the
WHO Regional Office for the Americas, coordinated by the WHO Country
Office, as well as support from the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre to
conduct intensified surveillance and to provide information to
communities on adequate precautions to protect against mosquito
bites. Vector control measures are also being implemented.

The outbreak in Jamaica is subsiding and an interruption in
transmission is expected soon. However, the Ministry of Health plans
to continue intense surveillance activities.

Jamaica is a non-endemic country for malaria. The occurrence of this
outbreak highlights the importance of conducting surveillance in
countries that are non-endemic to malaria.

WHO does not recommend any special restrictions to travel or trade to
or from Jamaica.
