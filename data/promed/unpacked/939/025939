Fish kill blamed on bacterial infection
---------------------------------------
Some dead fish are continuing to wash up near the Navesink River
Bridge here [Red Bank, NJ], and officials suspect it's the remnants
of hundreds of fish that died last month [April 2008] health
officials suspect it's an infection caused by the _Vibrio ordalii_
bacteria, which is toxic to fish but harmless to humans, said Sandy
Van Sant of the Monmouth Regional Health Commission.

Health officers took samples of the water when the fish first started
to wash up near Oyster Point and the Riverview Medical Center, Van
Sant said. The state Department of Environmental Protection tested
those samples and determined the bacteria was present.

"We've researched it, and there is no evidence that it can be a human
pathogen," Van Sant said. "Even touching the dead fish would not be
harmful to people."

Fish kills are often seen when water temperatures change, said
William Simmons, Monmouth County's environmental health coordinator.
The area saw 10 major kills last year, causing many residents in the
area to be come more sensitized to the events, he said.

The bunker fish, or Menhaden, which have been dying from the
bacterial infection, are especially important to the area because of
the cleansing effect they have on area waterways, Simmons said.

Experts say adult Menhaden can filter as much as 4 gallons of water a minute.

"They're an underrated fish," Simmons said. "They clean algae, and
they're often seen in areas like marinas where they help to keep that
water clean."

[_Vibrio ordalii_, has previously been known as _V anguillarm_
biotype II which causes vibriosis. This particular vibrio is most
often found in brackish water.

Common names for _Vibrio_ infections of fish include "red pest" of
eels, "salt-water furunculosis," "red boil," and "pike pest."

Following the consumption of contaminated shellfish some _Vibrio_
species can cause disease in humans. Most serious illness is usually
limited to individuals with a suppressed immune system, such as those
with liver disease or other immune deficiencies.

As a precaution gloves should be worn while cutting up fish or
examining sick fish, followed by thorough hand washing with a
bactericidal soap afterwards.

Menhaden are also known as shad, fatback and porgy. They are an oily
fish and often used as bait because of their strong active swimming
habits. - Mod.TG]
