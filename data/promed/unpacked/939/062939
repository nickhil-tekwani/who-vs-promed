Headlines

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Pakistan - 2 cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and 5 WPV1 positive environmental samples;
- Nigeria - advance notification one case of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) and 2 circulating VDPV2 positive environmental samples.

Afghanistan
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 was 21.
- No WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported this week.
- Afghanistan recently concluded a targeted national campaign.

Pakistan
- 2 cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported this week. One case is from Lakki Marwat district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the other is from Bajour Agency in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The onset of paralysis was [16 and 25 Dec 2018] respectively.
- 5 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: one each from Peshawar and Bannu districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, one from Lahore in Punjab province, one from Quetta in Balochistan province, and one from Karachi Gadap in Sindh province. Samples were collected from [10-27 Dec 2018].

Nigeria
- There is an advance notification of a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) case in Baruten LGA in Kwara state (close to Benin border). The case had an onset of paralysis on [5 Dec 2018]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 was 33.
- 2 cVDPV2-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: one from Bauchi state and one from Maiduguri in Borno state, collected on [5 and 13 Nov 2018] respectively.
- No cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported. The most recently-detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the 1st centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in Niger was 9, which are genetically linked to a cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. The virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018] through [7 Sep 2018].
- Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- Active case finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.

Central Africa
- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 was 20.
- DRC is affected by 4 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, in the provinces of Haut Katanga; Mongala, Maniema and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- Following the Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication in July 2016, the 2 large scale vaccination rounds implemented during September and October 2018, demonstrated better vaccination quality. Planning is underway to maintain the gains made so far and maintain population immunity as well as sensitive surveillance across the country.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network, to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will continue to support authorities across the country, to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week.
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) and type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Somalia has reported a total of 12 cVDPV cases (5 type 2, 6 type 3 and 1, coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) in 2018.
- Circulating VDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in one environmental sample in Kenya.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally-agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia. Another vaccination round is planned during end-November [2018 - presumably this was held but....] as part of the ongoing outbreak response, to further enhance the population immunity in the highest risk areas. Special surveillance activities continue to be undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 was 26.
- Emergency Operation Centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nation-wide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15, due to large numbers of poorly-immunized older children.
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

Mozambique
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak has been reported this week.
- 2 genetically-linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) isolates were detected, from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case (with onset of paralysis on [21 Oct 2018], in a 6-year old girl with no history of vaccination, from Molumbo district, Zambézia province), and a community contact of the case.
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.
- In January 2017, a single VDPV2 virus had been isolated from a 5-year old boy with AFP, also from Zambézia province (Mopeia district). Outbreak response was conducted in the 1st half of 2017 with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2).

[The total global tally for 2018 continues to grow, with new cases of both WPV1 and cVDPV confirmed in the past week. As of 16 Jan 2019, there have been 31 cases of WPV1 reported and 101 cases of cVDPV reported with onset of paralysis during 2018.

The above global update confirms the 2 cases of WPV1 associated disease in Pakistan and the case of cVDPV2 in Nigeria mentioned in prior ProMED-mail posts that were based on media reports (and the Pakistan End-Polio website) (Poliomyelitis update (05): Nigeria cVDPV, Pakistan environmental samples, RFI 20190115.6260612, Poliomyelitis update (04): Pakistan (FATA) 20190113.6256611, and Poliomyelitis update (03): global (Mozambique), Pakistan 2018 20190110.6252275).

Additional information available on the advanced notification of the case in Nigeria was a date of onset of paralysis of 5 Dec 2019. Information that is not available as yet is whether the cVDPV2 identified in this case was related to one of the 2 known strains circulating in Nigeria (Jigawa state or Sokoto state) or whether this is a new strain circulating near the border with Benin. We await further information on this case.

There have been no new cases of cVDPV associated disease reported in the other "active" countries during 2018 (DR Congo, Somalia, Niger, Mozambique, or Papua New Guinea), while one can be hopeful, it is too soon to declare transmission interrupted.

[2] WHO committee observations - media report
Date: Tue 15 Jan 2018, 10:38 AM GMT

An emergency committee of the World Health Organization [WHO] has recommended polio as an emergency public health concern following the upsurge of cases. The paralyzing disease, according to the committee, is a serious health threat that could spread globally as efforts of fighting the disease reveals stagnation.

In the committee's recommendation, Kenya is among countries classified as potential risk of international spread with most recent detection of the disease recorded on March 2018. Kenya, among other Countries including Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Niger and Somalia remains countries of major concern. "The outbreaks of polio in Somalia, Kenya, DR Congo, Niger and Somalia continue to be of major concern, particularly the apparent international spread between Somalia and Kenya and the recent spread from Nigeria into Niger, given that traditionally viruses have rarely spread across borders. Conflict and population movement within and outside DR Congo indicate a degree of risk of spread," the statement by the committee released on [30 Dec 2018] said.

The countries, according to the Committee, have been recommended to intensify regional cooperation and cross border coordination to enhance surveillance for prompt detection of the disease as well as increase immunization coverage. The countries, the committee stated, are also required to provide detailed reports to the Director General of the World Health organization at the end of the year, if without evidence of any transmission. "At the end of 12 months without evidence of transmission, provide a report to the Director-General on measures taken to implement the Temporary Recommendations," the committee noted. The countries are also required to officially declare that the interruption of the disease is a national public health emergency.

WHO noted that 27 cases of wild poliovirus have been recorded worldwide in 2018 compared with 22 total cases in 2017 [note, since the beginning of January 2019, the global total for 2018 has increased to 31 cases. - Mod.MPP].The committee said the trend, however small, reveals stagnation in the fight against the disease.

The Committee commended the continued high level commitment seen in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the significant degree of cooperation and coordination, particularly in reaching high risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border. The committee noted that it is 4 years since there has been international spread outside of these 2 epidemiologically linked countries. However, the Committee expressed concern on the increase in the disease cases globally in 2018, especially in Afghanistan. In Pakistan the committee noted, the situation in 2018 stagnated, with the number of cases so far at the same level in 2018 [see above, it has increased. - Mod.MPP] as for the whole of 2017.
