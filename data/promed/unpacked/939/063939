https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/08/cdc-unvaccinated-5-times-more-likely-get-covid-19


Today [24 Aug 2021] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published new data from Los Angeles County collected from May to July [2021], which show unvaccinated people were 5 times more likely to get COVID-19 than vaccinated peers and 29 times more likely to be hospitalized for their infections (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e5.htm). It's more evidence that the pandemic in the United States is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH at a White House press briefing today [24 Aug 2021].

"The data [remind] us that if you are not vaccinated you are the highest at risk," said Walensky. The study included analysis of the 43 127 SARS-CoV-2 infections in residents of Los Angeles County, California, of which 10 895 (25.3%) were in fully vaccinated persons, 1431 (3.3%) were in partially vaccinated persons, and 30 801 (71.4%) were in unvaccinated persons. During that period, the percentage of vaccinated residents rose from 27% to 51%, and the delta (B1617.2) variant became the predominant strain.

With full approval of the Pfizer vaccine by the Food and Drug Administration yesterday [23 Aug 2021], White House COVID-19 Coordinator Jeff Zients said he is confident even more Americans will choose to get vaccinated. Zients said the administration oversaw 6 million shots in arms in the past 7 days, the highest 7-day total in 6 weeks.

"At the end of last week, for 3 straight days, there were one million shots in arms per day," Zients said, observing it was the 1st time since June [2021] the [country] had seen those numbers. The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows 51.5% of Americans are fully vaccinated, and 60.8% have received at least one dose (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total).

Despite the uptick in vaccinations, the 4th wave of the pandemic continues. Walensky said the new 7-day average number of cases was 137 000 per day, an increase of 12%, and the hospitalization rate remained 11 000 per day. Daily deaths increased 23%, to an average of 739 per day.

In a 2nd MMWR report today [24 Aug 2021], results from the ongoing HEROES-RECOVER study of COVID-19 among frontline workers showed unvaccinated workers were much more likely to become infected during the current delta surge, but vaccine effectiveness (VE) dropped from roughly 90% to 66% (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7034e4.htm).

"However, this trend should be interpreted with caution because VE might also be declining as time since vaccination increases and because of poor precision in estimates due to limited number of weeks of observation and few infections among participants," the authors warned. "As with all observational VE studies, unmeasured and residual confounding might be present."

Federal data indicate one-third of US adolescents aged 12-15 are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to Fox News. The numbers were released as school has started or will start in the coming weeks throughout the country (https://www.foxnews.com/health/one-third-adolescents-vaccinated-covid-19-school-begins).

About 6 in 10 Americans say students and teachers should be required to wear face masks while in school, according to a new Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll. The poll also shows 59% support vaccination requirements for teachers, and 55% say the same for students 12 and over (https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-health-education-coronavirus-pandemic-only-on-ap-0440d83602da918c571d506a3de9f44b). But poll results were split sharply along political lines: About 30% of Republicans said they favor mask requirements for students and teachers, compared with 80% of Democrats.

Other US developments

- Oregon announced today [24 Aug 2021] it will require masks outside in crowded public places, including concerts and sporting events.

- The American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation today [24 Aug 2021] launched the 1st dashboard to track how many Americans have long COVID by state, county, and region (https://pascdashboard.aapmr.org/).

- With cases surging and hospitals filling up, Hawaii Gov. David Ige yesterday [23 Aug 2021] asked tourists and residents to reduce travel to the islands. The governor also said he supported limits on gatherings imposed on the island of Oahu (https://www.npr.org/2021/08/23/1030532161/hawaii-governor-tourists-stay-away-covid).

[2] Homebound adults

The number of older adults who are homebound (leaving home once a week or less) increased in 2020 over the prior decade, according to a research letter yesterday [23 Aug 2021] in JAMA Internal Medicine (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2783103). The researchers say that this could affect social, psychological, and physical needs because of factors such as physical distancing and caretaker or telehealth access.

The data used survey responses from the US National Health and Aging Trends Study from 1 May 2011 to 31 Oct 2020, which included 10 785 people 70 and older observed an average of 4.6 times. The prevalence of homebound adults ages 70-75 years more than doubled, from approximately 5.0% (1.6 million) from 2011-2019 to 13.0% (4.2 million) in 2020.

The population increase is most likely because of COVID-19 mitigations, according to the researchers. They note that in 2020, being homebound increased the most among Hispanic people (34.5% vs 12.6% to 17.2% in previous years), followed by Black people (22.6% vs 6.9% to 9.9%), and White people (10.1% vs 3.7% to 6.0%).

In 2020, non-White, homebound adults 70 and older were more likely to live with more people; for instance, 18.8% of White people lived with at least 2 other people, compared with 47.6% of Hispanics and 37.5% of Black people. About 44% of homebound White people lived alone. The researchers say that those who live alone may not be receiving adequate care, but conversely, those who live with others may have been at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

Also in 2020, 27.8% of all respondents did not have a cellphone, 50.8% did not have a computer, and more than half had not used email or texted (52.0%) or gone online (55.2%) in the last month. Not only could this affect social and psychological wellbeing during the pandemic, but the researchers suggest this could also affect access to digital services such as telehealth.

Post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 antibodies found in breast milk
-----------------------------------------------------------
After COVID-19 vaccination, 21 lactating healthcare workers showed significant increases in SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in their breast milk, according to a study published in Breastfeeding Medicine late last week [20 Aug 2021] (https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/bfm.2021.0122).

The researchers recruited from the University of Florida health system from December 2020 to March 2021 and sampled blood and breast milk pre-vaccination, 16-30 days after the 1st dose, and 7-10 days after the 2nd dose. All healthcare workers received either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine.

Data showed that from pre-vaccination to after the 2nd dose, SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) significantly increased in breast milk, with IgA positivity in 85% of 21 participants and IgG positivity in 100% of 10 participants. In blood, IgG seropositivity was found after the 1st and 2nd doses, and IgA seropositivity significantly increased after full vaccination. For both IgA and IgG, data showed a positive link between breast milk and blood antibodies.

"We saw a robust antibody response in blood and breast milk after the 2nd dose -- about a 100-fold increase compared with levels before vaccination," noted Lauren Stafford, a doctoral student working in the lab of senior author Joseph Larkin III, PhD, in a University of Florida press release.

The average age of the cohort was 34 years, and all but one participant was White. Three had a lower milk supply after the COVID-19 vaccination, but the study did not do a longer-term follow-up to see if the effect resolved. Future areas of research include understanding the effectiveness of breast milk antibodies, how long they linger, and if they can stimulate babies to create their own COVID-19 antibodies.

[From the University of Florida press release regarding post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 antibodies found in breast milk (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/926206):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"'The results of our study strongly suggest that vaccines can help protect both mom and baby, another compelling reason for pregnant or lactating women to get vaccinated,' [said Josef Neu, MD, one of the study's co-authors and a professor in the UF College of Medicine's department of pediatrics, division of neonatology]."

"'Babies can also catch COVID-19, so routine vaccination of mothers against the virus could be something we see in the future,' [said Vivian Valcarce, MD, a resident in the UF College of Medicine's department of pediatrics, division of neonatology]."

"With that in mind, the research team is continuing to explore how breast milk containing COVID-19 antibodies gained through vaccination protects babies who consume it.

"'We would like to know if infants who consume breast milk containing these antibodies develop their own protection against COVID-19,' [said Joseph Larkin III, PhD, senior author of the study and an associate professor in the UF/IFAS department of microbiology and cell science]. 'In addition, we would also like to know more about the antibodies themselves, such as how long they are present in breast milk and how effective they are at neutralizing the virus.'

"Neu said his lab is also interested in exploring the potential therapeutic uses of breast milk produced by vaccinated mothers." - Mod.LK]

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/08/who-airs-concern-over-covid-control-medical-supplies-afghanistan


At a briefing today [24 Aug 2021], the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean office said the group is worried that upheaval in Afghanistan will fuel a spike in COVID-19 cases and that the country has only enough medical supplies to last one week.

Ahmed Al-Mandhari, MD, PhD, who directs the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean office (EMRO), said that, alongside upheaval, increasing population movements could lead to a spike in COVID-19 cases. "We need to keep the COVID pandemic under control," he said.

According to the latest EMRO update, cases in Afghanistan are declining, with 77 illnesses and 7 deaths reported yesterday [23 Aug 2021]. Al-Mandhari also said with just one week of medical supplies on the ground, prioritizing deliveries is crucial to keep healthcare activities going.

In a 22 Aug 2021 statement, the WHO and UNICEF said the main focus in recent days has been evacuations of international people and vulnerable Afghans, but they warned that the massive humanitarian needs facing most of the country shouldn't be ignored (http://www.emro.who.int/media/news/amidst-kabul-airport-blockage-who-and-unicef-call-for-assistance-to-deliver-critical-health-supplies-to-afghanistan.html). And Al-Mandhari said today [24 Aug 2021] that even before the latest events, Afghanistan represented the 3rd largest humanitarian operation in the world.

The 2 groups said they are committed to staying and helping the people of Afghanistan, with a network of 684 staff working in all 34 provinces. Last week [18 Aug 2021], Doctors Without Borders (MSF) also said its teams are staying put, with medical activities running in all 5 projects it runs (https://www.msf.org/medical-needs-urgent-ever-afghanistan-after-taliban-takeover). In the Herat facility, the number of patients seeking care at the COVID-19 treatment center has slightly declined.

The WHO and UNICEF said, "With no commercial aircraft currently permitted to land in Kabul, we have no way to get supplies into the country and to those in need. Other humanitarian agencies are similarly constrained."

With the Kabul airport blocked, the WHO and UNICEF called for help in delivering critical health supplies to Afghanistan. They pressed for the immediate establishment of a humanitarian air bridge to allow sustained delivery of aid to the country.

[The report states that in one medical facility in Afghanistan, the number of patients seeking care at the COVID-19 treatment center has slightly declined. It seems like it would be very difficult to get accurate case counts with the chaos in the country. Furthermore, the ongoing movement of masses of people is bound to increase spread of such an infectious virus as the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant. - Mod.LK]

[4] Hospital transmission
Date: Tue 24 Aug 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/08/study-patients-not-staff-source-most-hospital-covid-spread


Most hospital patients diagnosed as having COVID-19 contracted the virus from other patients rather than healthcare workers (HCWs), with 21% of patients causing 80% of cases, finds a UK study today [24 Aug 2021] in eLife (https://elifesciences.org/articles/67308).

A team led by researchers at the University of Cambridge analyzed data from 5 wards at the university's Addenbrooke's Hospital during a COVID-19 outbreak among patients and HCWs from March to June 2020. The team applied a new network reconstruction algorithm to infer patterns of virus spread among patients and HCWs.

Of 38 transmission events studied, 20 were patient to patient, 8 were from patient to HCW, 8 were HCW to HCW, and 2 were HCW to patient. "These results suggest that patients were significantly more likely to be infected by other patients than by health care workers (p value 6.1 x 10exp5, one-tailed binomial test)," the study authors wrote. "By contrast, HCWs were at approximately equal risk of being infected by patients and other HCWs."

In addition, 21% of patients were "superspreaders" and caused 80% of the infections, a result that the authors said was similar to that reported among the general population. In one ward, for example, 2 patients were the sources of 4 and 5 secondary COVID-19 infections, respectively.

Five people, including 4 patients and one HCW, infected at least 3 other people. All 4 patients had suspected hospital-acquired COVID-19 and significant underlying illnesses, including chronic liver disease and blood cancer, the latter of which one person was receiving immunosuppressive therapy for. Immunosuppression has been tied to prolonged viral shedding.

One superspreader was confused and wandered the ward, while another had a fever for a few days before testing positive for COVID-19, which was likely acquired in the community. The sole HCW superspreader infected only other staff sharing the same accommodations.

Viral loads were similar among superspreaders and others in the study. "We note that, while prolonged or increased viral shedding would increase the chance of an individual becoming a superspreader, behavioural and environmental factors may also be influential," the researchers wrote.

The inferred times of transmission from superspreaders followed different patterns. In one ward, 3 initial HCW infections by one person were likely to have occurred within 4 days after the introduction of the virus, which the researchers said suggested that outbreaks involving a superspreader source may spread quickly.

"Preventing new cases of hospital-based infection is a critical part of our work," co-lead author William Hamilton, MBBChir, PhD, said in a University of Cambridge press release. "Here we have shown that analysing clinical and viral genome sequence data can produce insights that inform infection control measures, which are so important for protecting patients and healthcare workers alike."

The researchers noted that effectively quarantining COVID-19 patients from uninfected patients is difficult when hospitals are overwhelmed with cases, a problem compounded by the high transmissibility of the virus and asymptomatic infections.

"The fact that the vast majority of infections were between patients suggests that measures taken by hospital staff to prevent staff transmitting the virus to patients, such as the wearing of masks, were likely to have been effective," co-lead author Christopher Illingworth, PhD, said in the release. "But it also highlights why it is important that patients themselves are screened for COVID-19 regularly, even if asymptomatic, and wear face masks where possible."

The authors called for strict adherence to infection-control protocols such as the appropriate use of personal protective equipment at all times, regardless of clinical area; universal masking, as tolerated; screening of asymptomatic patients and HCWs; isolation of ill patients; vigilance to the potential for hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections; and a low threshold for testing -- even in cases with other diagnostic possibilities.

"Finally, our identification of transmission from patients to HCWs highlights the use of higher grade respiratory precaution to protect HCWs (such as FFP3 respirators) as an important topic for future research," the researchers wrote.

They also recommend future research into factors with possible links to increased transmission risk, including SARS-CoV-2 variants, patient characteristics (e.g., immunosuppression), and environmental factors such as patient location and room ventilation.

[The researchers found a "trend towards individuals either infecting no one else or infecting multiple other people -- just over one-fifth of patients (21%) caused 80% of the infections. This phenomenon is sometimes called 'superspreading' and can make infection control very challenging. Whether or not an individual can be identified in advance as being more or less likely to pass on the virus is an ongoing topic of research.

"Dr. William Hamilton, an infectious diseases clinician at CUH (Cambridge University Hospitals) and co-lead author on the study said: 'Preventing new cases of hospital-based infection is a critical part of our work. Here we have shown that analysing clinical and viral genome sequence data can produce insights that inform infection control measures, which are so important for protecting patients and healthcare workers alike'" (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/926034). - Mod.LK]
