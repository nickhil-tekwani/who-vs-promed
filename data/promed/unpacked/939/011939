After reading the "Superbug" thread we could not help but respond. We make the
following observations on the Superbug hypothesis:
First, the reason for the focus on dairy cattle (LaBudde in Vol 97, no. 80)
in the Superbug discussion is not clear to us. E. coli O157 is at least as
frequent in beef as in dairy cattle, and for that matter, roughly as
frequent in sheep and deer as in cattle. Limited sampling has revealed the
agent in monogastric species (dog, bird, horse) as well, though the relative
frequencies in these are unknown due to the lack of sampling.
Another problem with the focus on dairy cattle is related to the antibiotic
mediated emergence hypothesis that seems to be the central theme of the
"superbug" discussion. Dairy cattle and beef cattle used for breeding
purposes are much less likely to get antibiotics in their rations than are
feedlot cattle. Indeed, lactating dairy cattle in the USA would most
commonly not be receiving antibiotics in feed or otherwise. Growing dairy
cattle do sometimes receive antibiotics in feed, but much less commonly
than, say, feedlot cattle (or swine or poultry, for that matter).
The antibiotic mediated emergence of a superbug suffers from several
problems in the context of available data about E. coli O157. Most isolates
of E. coli O157 are, in fact, not antibiotic resistant. While this does not
exclude mechanisms which involve gut floral changes which might, in turn,
enhance the ease with which E. coli 0157 might colonize, such effects are,
in the absence of data, speculation multi-tiered speculation. A final
problem relates to the fact that E. coli O157 can be found, sometimes at
relatively high prevalence, in situations where cattle are not on
antibiotics; and, to our knowledge, no clear cut association has been found
between antibiotic feeding and E. coli O157 prevalence in cattle. We believe
that the role of antibiotics in feed, especially the ionophore class of
antibiotics which are fed specifically to modify GI flora, do merit
scrutiny; but the strongly held view that antibiotics in feed are the cause
of the present E. coli O157 problem as expounded by some in the superbug
thread, seems premature, to say the least.
The concept that antibiotics select for organisms which burrow into the
intestinal wall (Dr. LaBudde, vol 97, no.81) is another hypothesis that
seems to suffer in the context of available data. Specifically, we are not
aware of any documented evidence that E. coli O157 burrows into the
intestinal wall to escape antibiotics (in the rumen?) or for any other
reason. Indeed, available data suggest to our interpretation that E. coli
O157 is not invasive in cattle.
