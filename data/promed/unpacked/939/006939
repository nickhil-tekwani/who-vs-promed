Foot and mouth disease, Myanmar
-------------------------------
Information received on 11 Nov 2010 from Prof Dr Myint Thein, director
general, Livestock Breeding and Veterinary Department, Ministry of
Livestock & Fisheries, Yangoon, Myanmar

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Start date: 10 Sep 2010
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 7 Oct 2010
Report date: 10 Nov 2010
Date submitted to OIE: 11 Nov 2010
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Foot and mouth disease virus [FMDV]
Serotype: A
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Location: Rakhine State (Kun Thee Pin, Maungdaw, Maungdaw)
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 741 / 350 / 0 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection:
- contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering;
- fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc.);
- airborne spread;
- contact with wild species.

Epidemiological comments: the outbreak area is located in a remote area and
the index case could be earlier than this reported outbreak. The source of
infection is inconclusive because local people use a different dialect and
collecting information is hard. And there were memory recall biases during
the investigation.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country.

Vaccination in response to the outbreak:
Administrative division / Species / Total vaccinated / Details
Rakhine state / Cattle / 350

Dipping/spraying; treatment of affected animals (supportive treatment such
as antipyretics and analgesics to the cattle with fever, and topical
application on the lesions of hoof and coronary band.)

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National FMD Laboratory, Insein, Yangon (national
laboratory)
Tests and results:
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / liquid-phase blocking ELISA / 7 Oct 2010 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The affected farm is located in western Myanmar, adjacent to the border
with Bangladesh (see map at the source URL above). According to the data of
the WRLFMD (Pirbright), FMDV serotype A has not been reported from Myanmar
since 1978 (<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/mya.htm>), in
contrast to FMDV-O which has been circulating there during 2008-2010;
serotype Asia1 was last reported in 2005.

According to the same source, FMDV-A was last reported from neighboring
Bangladesh in 1999. However, serotype A is reportedly endemic in other
neighbors, India and Thailand. This serotype has been last reported from
another neighbour, Laos. China has been experiencing an epizootic of FMDV-A
since 2009, after its reported absence for several decades. Sequencing
results of the Chinese isolate can be seen at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2009/WRLFMD-2009-0000A-China-A.pdf>;
it is most closely related to Malaysian an Thai strains.

It would be interesting to obtain details on the genotype of the FMD-A
virus isolated in Myanmar, as well as on the vaccine applied.

Myanmar is one of the 8 countries participating in the South East Asia Foot
and Mouth Disease Campaign (SEAFMD), involving the coordinated control of
FMD in the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region. The
useful SEAFMD website, with updated tables and maps, is available at
