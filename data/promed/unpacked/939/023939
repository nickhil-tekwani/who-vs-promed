With about 400 animals, Oregon's Lookout Mountain bighorn sheep herd is considered to be one of the biggest in the state. However, recent reports of bighorns coughing have state wildlife biologists concerned the disease -- particularly pneumonia -- could impact the future of the herd. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) are closely monitoring the herd to see what happens but won't know "how severe the death toll" will be until later this year [2020], The Bulletin reports (https://bit.ly/2Lk6K9T).

The Lookout Mountain herd is primarily composed of California bighorn sheep. While the herd was previously considered healthy, on 13 Feb 2020 a dead bighorn ram was reported to ODFW, according to The Bulletin. The carcass, found about 18 miles north of Huntington, tested positive for _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_ bacteria -- bacteria having caused massive die-offs in bighorn sheep herds across the West. This confirmation moved ODFW to cancel 2 bighorn sheep hunts slated for the summer and fall [2020] in the Lookout Mountain unit, eliminating 2 resident and 1 nonresident tags completely.

Since the 1st ram was discovered, 10 to 12 additional bighorn sheep have died, with the most recent death on 5 Apr 2020, according to Brian Ratliff, district wildlife biologist. All carcasses tested positive for the same strain of bacteria. "Biologists don't know -- indeed, they might never confirm -- how the herd was infected," said Ratliff.

According to The Bulletin, there are 2 residents with domestic sheep in the unit and they've volunteered to have their animals tested; however, the results of those tests are not yet known. "Even if the domestic sheep are carrying the bacteria, it wouldn't be conclusive proof the bighorns were infected by contact with domestic sheep," said Ratliff.

For now, ODFW will continue to monitor the herd and hope that a massive die-off doesn't happen in the future.

[_Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_ is a respiratory pathogen of Caprinae, including domestic sheep, domestic goats, bighorn sheep, and mountain goats. _M. ovipneumoniae_ causes atypical pneumonia and can also predispose to lung infections with many other bacterial species. _M. ovipneumoniae_ infection is associated with pneumonia in all ages of bighorn sheep upon initial exposure, and often causes recurrent fatal lamb pneumonia outbreaks in subsequent years. _M. ovipneumoniae_ infection of domestic sheep and goats is typically associated with mild disease, most often a "coughing syndrome" of lambs and kids under 6 months of age. Less frequently, _M. ovipneumoniae_ is associated with severe or fatal pneumonia in domestic lambs and adult and kid goats (https://waddl.vetmed.wsu.edu/animal-disease-faq/mycoplasma-ovipneumoniae-diagnostics-in-domestic-and-wild-sheep-and-goats).

_Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_ was also isolated from many of the bighorn sheep in the outbreaks in 2010 (in some instances, from 100% of the animals sampled). In 2010, no viruses had been positively linked to the outbreaks, but many wild sheep herds have titers to parainfluenza 3 and (bovine) respiratory syncytial viruses, and one report detected a 4-fold increase in titers to these viruses. Researchers have had difficulty reproducing the severe pneumonia occurring in the bighorns with _M. ovipneumoniae_ alone. It could be that like _Mycoplasma dispar_ in calves, coinfection with _Mycoplasma_ and _Pasteurella_ causes a more severe disease syndrome. In addition, it has been determined a leukotoxin produced by _Mannheimia haemolytica_ serotype A1 is a virulence factor for bighorn sheep.

Bighorn sheep pneumonia has been causing die-offs for several years. The disease has traditionally been considered multifactorial. However, recent evidence indicates that in north western USA there seems to be a single pathogen implicated in bighorn sheep outbreaks, _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_, an exotic disease agent for North America, introduced by domestic ovids. The bighorn sheep pneumonia web of causation may have an important environmental component. In recent years, die-offs of bighorn sheep in several locations suggest that the proximate cause of these events may be a shared environmental determinant.
