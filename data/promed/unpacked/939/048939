Please note the incorrect statement regarding the 2011 outbreak of HPAI in ostriches. It was identified as HPAI H5N2 and not H5N1.

[Dr Cloete's corrective comment is gratefully acknowledged; it relates to the following passage included in the report of "BusinessDayLive" (South Africa), cited in the posting referenced above:
"South Africa's ostrich industry was devastated in 2011 by an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain..."

The 2011 outbreak was indeed caused by HPAI H5N2 and not by HPAI H5N1 (see ProMED postings 20110413.1161, 20110415.1180, 20110413.1161); we regret maintaining the erroneous detail.

The HPAI H5N2 epizootic in ostriches in the Western Cape province, which started 1 Feb 2011, is -- according to current OIE information -- "continuing". So far, 50 outbreaks have been reported, notified to the OIE in 14 "follow-up" reports, the most recent of which submitted 15 Apr 2013, reporting 2 new outbreaks. Follow-up report no 14 is available, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=13233.

According to a summarising report, during the mentioned 50 HPAI H5N2 outbreaks, there were 15 705 cases among the 55 038 susceptible ostriches, of which 108 died, 4930 were destroyed and 43 917 were slaughtered (see, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013233_20130415_163853.pdf. - Mod.AS]
