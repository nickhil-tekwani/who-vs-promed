The list of species added to the message could be read as if raccoons
(Procyonidae) and skunks (Mustelidae) were present in Russia. In fact,
these 2 kinds of carnivores are not naturally present in the Old World.
Here we can find species like chacal, foxes, raccoon dog (Canidae) or stone
marten (Mustelidae), all possibly involved in rabies epidemiology, but not
skunks or raccoons.
However, raccoons have been introduced, for different reasons, in some parts
of Europe, including Russia. The name "raccoon dog" may be misleading
especially when considering that this Far East Asiatic species has also
been introduced in western Russia for fur and has recently been observed in
western European countries.
All are affected by genotype 1 rabies virus. In the case of bats, American
strains are from genotype 1; in Europe, the genotypes involved with these
flying mammals are 5 and 6 (EBL1 and EBL 2, for European Bat Lyssavirus).
There epidemiology may be different.
