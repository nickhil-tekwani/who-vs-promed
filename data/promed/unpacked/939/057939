VIRAL MYOCARDITIS - MALAYSIA: CORRECTION

Bad enough to make an error, but to erroneously change someone's message so
that it looked like they made the error is awful. Yesterday Jack Woodall
sent a message to me to moderate and send for posting. I "fixed" his
message (immoderately) but introduced some typographical errors.
To Jack's description of the etiology of hand foot and mouth disease, I
added the etiologic agents of that syndrome, as found in Field's Virology,
but typed B where I meant A. The message SHOULD HAVE SAID:
"It is caused by Human coxsackieviruses A4, A5, A9, A10, and particularly
A16; by Human coxsackieviruses B2 and B5; and by Human enterovirus 71 (EV71).
My apologies to Jack and to any of our readers who have otherwise been
inconvenienced.
