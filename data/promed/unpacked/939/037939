Outbreak of multidrug-resistant _Salmonella_ infections linked to raw turkey products
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the last update on 19 Jul 2018, 74 ill people from 26 states have been added to this investigation. As of 5 Nov 2018, 164 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Reading have been reported from 35 states.

Total 164

Illnesses started on dates from 20 Nov 2017 to 20 Oct 2018. Ill people range in age from less than one year to 91 years, with a median age of 45 years. Of the ill people, 56% are female. Of 135 people with information available, 63 (47%) have been hospitalized. One death has been reported from California.

Investigation of the outbreak
--------------------------
State and local health departments continue to interview ill people about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of 85 people interviewed, 44 (52%) people interviewed reported preparing or eating turkey products that were purchased raw, including ground turkey, turkey pieces, and whole turkey. Ill people reported buying many different brands of raw turkey products from multiple stores. Also, 3 of the 85 ill people interviewed became sick after pets in their home ate raw ground turkey pet food. In addition, 3 of the 85 ill people interviewed worked in a facility that raises or processes turkeys, or lived with someone who did.

The outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Reading has been identified in samples from raw turkey pet food in Minnesota, from live turkeys from several states, and from raw turkey products collected from ill people's homes. The raw turkey samples collected from ill people's homes are still being investigated to determine the source of the turkey.

The outbreak strain was also identified in samples from raw turkey products from 22 slaughter and 7 processing establishments. The samples collected by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) at these slaughter and processing establishments were part of FSIS's routine testing under the _Salmonella_ performance standards. Furthermore, whole genome sequencing (WGS) showed that the _Salmonella_ strain isolated from these samples is closely related genetically to the _Salmonella_ strain from ill people. This result provides more evidence that people in this outbreak got sick from preparing raw turkey products.

WGS analysis did not identify predicted antimicrobial resistance in 116 isolates from 53 ill people and 63 food and animal samples. However, 68 isolates from ill people and 84 isolates from food, animal, and environmental samples contained genes for resistance to all or some of the following antimicrobials: ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, kanamycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and fosfomycin. Testing of 5 outbreak isolates using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing by the CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory confirmed these results. Most of the infections in this outbreak are susceptible to the antimicrobials that are commonly used for treatment, so this resistance likely will not affect the choice of therapy used to treat most people.

Available data indicate that this strain of _Salmonella_ Reading may be present in live turkeys and in raw turkey products. A single common supplier of raw turkey products or of live turkeys has not been identified.

[The mechanism of transmission in this prolonged outbreak seems to include exposure to live birds, working in the processing plant and eating or preparing the product, as well as exposure to pets that consumed the raw pet food. - Mod.LL
