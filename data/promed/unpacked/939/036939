In a previous posting, Dr. J. Olsen commented on the low incidence of
_Leptospira_ in domestic pets. I would like to add a word of caution in
this area. It may be the true incidence of leptospirosis in pets is higher
than reported due to underdiagnosis. It must be remembered in order for a
diagnosis of leptospirosis to be made the following steps must occur:
-the owner notices that the pet is ill
- the owner takes the animal to the veterinarian
- the veterinarian is able to perform a diagnostic workup (economic
constraints may limit)
- the clinical/laboratory findings result in leptospirosis being considered
as a possible rule out (the feeling the incidence is low usually reduces
this possibility being included high on differential list)
- diagnostic measures capable of identifying leptospirosis are undertaken
(usually serology to multiple serovars)
I know from experience many renal and hepatic conditions in dogs are left
without arriving at a definitive diagnosis, even if the animal is presented
to the veterinarian and the owners are willing to pay for the preliminary
lab tests. As economics play a larger role in tests offered, and the
capacity to do them, especially in a species that is not considered to be
at high risk for the disease, more and more of these will go undiagnosed.
In addition, access to the information on the diagnosis of diseases that
are not reportable by law are becoming harder to access due to the fact
these are diagnosed in private diagnostic facilities and do not become part
of the public or academic record.
You will not diagnose what you do not test for. At the same time, it is
acknowledged it is not economically feasible to follow what may be
considered a zebra diagnosis unless there is some suspicion the search will
be fruitful. Public and academic diagnostic facilities are finding it
harder and harder to find the funds (and incidentally the time) necessary
to follow these possibilities especially in pet animals (they are not
considered for funding that is intended to help food production industries
and usually not for public health funding and other priorities supersede).
An interesting reference by Prescott, J., Key, D. and Osuch, M. (Canadian
Vet Journal, vol. 40, pp.430-431, 1999) reports 23 cases of leptospirosis
in Ontario in a 6 month period in 1998.
