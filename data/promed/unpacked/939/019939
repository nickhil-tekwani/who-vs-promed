Tests link virus to dead Kiwi tourist
-------------------------------------
Tests have revealed that a female backpacker from New Zealand had a
highly infectious virus that can cause the same heart condition that
killed her in Thailand last month [February 2011]. Thai health
authorities are still investigating what caused the sudden deaths of a
23 year old backpacker and 4 others in Chiang Mai within 5 weeks,
[comprising] an elderly British couple, an American woman, and a Thai
woman.
The Kiwi backpacker and 2 friends became seriously ill with vomiting
and heart complications while staying at the Downtown Inn in the
northern tourist city.
The deceased died of myocarditis (acute inflammation of the heart
muscle) on 6 Feb 2011, and one of her companions needed emergency
heart surgery. Their illness was initially blamed on food poisoning
from a seaweed toxin.
Thai doctor Pasakorn Akarasewi met New Zealand embassy staff for a
2-hour briefing on Thursday night [10 Mar 2011] to report the
investigation's latest findings. His report includes newly released
autopsy tests, which showed the backpacker had [an] echovirus
[infection], a highly contagious disease linked to dirty, overcrowded
conditions, which can cause myocarditis.
Dr Akarasewi, director of the Bureau of Epidemiology for Thailand's
Department of Disease Control, said doctors were unsure what caused
the Kiwi backpacker's illness. Soon after, the team heard about the
deaths of an elderly British couple in the same hotel only 2 weeks
later. Members also heard about a 47 year old Thai woman who died in
the room next to the Kiwi backpacker on 3 Feb 2011 -- the day before
the New Zealander became severely ill. Dr Akarasewi said autopsy
results showed the British couple had blocked heart arteries, which
could have caused their deaths.
A 5th victim, a 33 year old American woman who died on 11 Jan 2011
though not in the Downtown Inn, had symptoms that were "in the same
pattern" as the backpacker. Although her death had occurred a month
earlier, an autopsy had been performed before her cremation in Chiang
Mai, he said.
Thai police had checked the Downtown Inn's air conditioning and
facilities but found nothing untoward.

[Similar reports from other sources forwarded by Denis Legion differ
in detail but do not shed additional light on these events. In one
report the backpacker's father is quoted as saying: "It is almost
beyond belief the deaths could be a coincidence. It seems beyond
coincidence that there should be 3 deaths or 4 in rooms adjacent to
each other over a very short period of time."
Echoviruses were originally discovered in human faeces, unassociated
with human disease during epidemiological studies of polioviruses. The
viruses were named echoviruses (enteric, cytopathic, human, orphan
viruses). These viruses were defined as picornaviruses isolated from
the gastrointestinal tract tract that produced a cytopathic effect in
cell cultures but did not induce detectable pathological lesions in
suckling mice. Altogether, 34 viruses were assigned echovirus serotype
designations but some were reclassified later. It is not unlikely that
a specific echovirus could be responsible for myocarditis in a
vulnerable individual, but an outbreak linked to specific location is
problematic. Further information on the specific diagnoses and the
microbiological investigations undertaken would be appreciated in due
course.
Chiang Mai is located in the mountainous north of Thailand and is a
favourite destination for tourists, attracting backpackers as well as
a more upmarket clientele of all ages. The hotel involved has been
rated a 2/3 star establishment.
