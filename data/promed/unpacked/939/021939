One of Nigeria's largest pig co-operative farms, located in Lagos State, has been affected by an outbreak of the deadly African swine fever [ASF].

According to a farmer at the Oke Aro farm, who spoke to the BBC, about 300 000 pigs have been killed so far. Ayo Omirin said that nearly 99 percent of the pig pens on the farm had been infected.

"We have lost 4 farmers as a result of shock, 2 of them slumped and died on the farm," Omirin said. According to the co-operative's president Adewale Oluwalana, the last case of ASF hit Oke Aro farm was in 2008.

The virus, which can kill pigs within a few days, can be transmitted by direct contact with infected pigs and wild boars or through infected animal feed and on clothing and farm equipment.

The farm, reportedly the largest in West Africa, is managed by the Lagos State government and is a source of livelihood to about 3000 farmers. Despite its size, it is unable to meet the demands of the region in terms of pig products.

Lagos State agriculture spokesman Jide Lawal said that a sensitisation exercise was ongoing to advise farmers on how to protect the surviving livestock.

The state government had distributed food aid to affected farmers and dispatched a team to fumigate farms in the south-west region, Lawal said.

The confirmation of the disease will spread fear among many households which rely on pig rearing to lift them out of poverty.

[Initially, ASF was restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, where it was endemic. Several incursions out of Africa were reported between the 1960s and 1970s. In 2007, ASF was introduced into Georgia, from where it spread to neighbouring countries including the Russian Federation. From there, ASF spread to eastern European countries extending westwards and reaching the European Union in 2014. Further westward and southern spread in Europe has occurred since that time.

In all these countries, both hosts -- domestic pigs and wild boar -- were affected by the disease. In August 2018, the People's Republic of China reported its 1st outbreak of ASF, and further spread in Asia has occurred, recently affecting Bangladesh and India.

The current distribution of ASF extends across more than 50 countries in 3 continents (Africa, Asia and Europe). There is no vaccine available; the disease is not zoonotic for humans. - Mod.AS
