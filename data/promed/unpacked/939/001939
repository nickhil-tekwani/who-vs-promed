West Nile virus has been found in a dead crow discovered in the Inner
Harbor Area of Baltimore, MD. The crow was sent for analyses, which proved
that it had died of the disease. There are no public reports of human
infection yet.

[We have received, but not posted, media reports that crows and other birds
over a large area of the northeastern U.S. are being tested for evidence of
WNV infection. This is the first report purportedly confirming the presence
of WNV outside the New York City area, The virus has been isolated from
birds in NY counties and state other than NY but no human or equine cases
have been detected outside New York state. For our readers who are
unfamiliar with the geography of the U.S., Baltimore is south of New York
City. If the report is correct, then either crows are migrating south from
the NY City area or the virus has spread south from that area (probably in
migrating birds) and is now being transmitted to local birds. Another
possibility is that the virus has been in the area for some time and only
now is being recognized. - Mod.CHC]
