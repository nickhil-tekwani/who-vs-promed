As of Mon 15 Jan 2018, there have been a total of:
1770 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
720 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.7 per cent],
1031 recoveries, and
19 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections as they are reported. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. Another complication is delayed reporting of cases which occurred during this period. As of the time of preparation of this report, information on today's [Tue 16 Jan 2018] update is still pending. - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update, through 11 Jan 2018, there has been a total of:
1 newly confirmed case,
3 newly reported fatalities, and
0 newly reported recoveries.

Information on newly confirmed cases: (1 case)

[Since the last ProMED-mail post, there has only been one newly confirmed case, reported from Riyadh, while there have been 3 newly reported fatalities raising the reported case fatality rate to 40.7 percent. It is curious that the newly reported case was noted to be in stable condition, yet the same day as that report, the individual was reported as a fatality, suggesting there may have been a sudden fatal event (either cardiovascular, CNS (neurologic), or pulmonary in origin. It is also possible that the patient was noted to be in stable condition at the time of hospitalization, but by the time of report may have had a rapid decline.

[2] Genomic evidence of camel role in transmission
Date: 16 Jan 2018

A new analysis of genetic history confirms the long-held suspicion that Middle East respiratory syndrome virus, which alarmed global health leaders in 2012 when it spilled over from camels to cause an often fatal illness in people, does not spread easily between humans. At least not yet.

In a paper published today [16 Jan 2018] in the journal eLife, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center's Drs. Gytis Dudas and Trevor Bedford modeled phylogenetic trees, or genetic histories, of all available MERS genome sequences, 100 from camels and 174 from humans.

"The genomic data confirms that the MERS virus is not at the moment spreading readily from person to person," said Bedford, an evolutionary biologist and the paper's senior author. "Almost all of the cases in the Arabian Peninsula are short chains that spill over from camels, infect a few people and then die out. That had been suspected, but not quantified."

The new analysis compared evolutionary changes in the camel and human genetic sequences to show that the virus jumped from camels to humans hundreds of times since 2012, with the 2000-plus human cases recorded since resulting mostly from repeated spillovers rather than person-to-person spread.

"Andrew [co-author Andrew Rambaut, a professor at the University of Edinburgh's Institute of Evolutionary Biology] had championed this idea for some time, and it had been accepted by most that it was not one introduction from camels into humans back in 2012," Bedford said. "Our analysis placed it at somewhere between 300 and 800 introductions with each introduction being responsible for an average of 3-4 cases."

Like other RNA viruses, MERS mutates rapidly, so researchers are able to use genomic sequences to track evolutionary changes over a span of months rather than, say, the million years it would take in humans or other large animals, said Dudas, a Mahan Postdoctoral Fellow at Fred Hutch and the paper's lead author.

"Mutations that accumulate over time are unique markers, and the patterns of shared ancestry between individual strains can be very informative," he said. "You can use those data to reconstruct the pathogen's perspective of an outbreak."

To build phylogenetic trees, Dudas used data from almost 300 genomic sequences along with when and from which host each sequence was collected. Many of the sequences came from public sources, such as GenBank, but a handful of them were openly shared by the team's collaborators from Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom.

The model showed that only mutations that arose during camel infection persisted in the viral population, indicating that camels are the host in which conditions are amenable for MERS to spread and sustain transmission.

"Once a virus entered humans -- it could be a single case, it could be small family clusters or limited community-transmission chains, it could be sizeable hospital outbreaks -- ultimately, those transmission chains died out," Dudas said. "MERS is sustained in camels, and humans are a dead-end host."

Although the data confirm that the MERS virus is poor at spreading among people, the paper points out that continued introductions of the virus from camels to humans remains alarming.

"Whenever we see a scenario like MERS where you have constant spillover from [an animal] reservoir into humans, that's asking for trouble," Dudas said. "You might get a variant that by pure luck happens to be good at transmitting between humans and gets naturally selected for better transmission."

Public health officials had reason to fear such a scenario when MERS emerged in 2012. MERS is part of a large family of viruses called coronaviruses that cause, among other human diseases, common colds. What alarmed the global health community was that MERS resembled a more serious illness caused by another coronavirus relative: severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.

SARS emerged in southeast China in late 2002, possibly spilling over from bats to civet cats before spreading efficiently among humans. The following year [2003], it swept the globe to more than 2 dozen countries in Asia, Europe, North America and South America, sickening 8089 people and killing 774 of them before the 2003 outbreak was contained (no new cases have been reported since).

MERS has caused 740 deaths in 2123 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection reported to the World Health Organization since the 1st case was identified in Saudi Arabia. An outbreak in multiple hospitals in South Korea in 2015 -- the largest outbreak outside the Middle East with 186 laboratory-confirmed infections and 36 deaths -- raised more alarms.

But MERS, despite its high mortality rate, has not behaved as SARS did. About 80 percent of human cases have been in Saudi Arabia, according to WHO. Epidemiologists traced human MERS cases to contact with infected camels or with people who had such contact. (The exact routes of transmission are unknown.) Cases identified in 26 other countries, including the South Korean hospital outbreaks, were traced to people who were infected while traveling in the Middle East.

All the signs on the ground pointed to the virus not spreading easily among people. But earlier attempts to model the genetic history of MERS showed the opposite. The problem, said Dudas, was that they did not correct for biases in the existing data, which include almost twice as many viral sequences from humans as from camels.

"Unlike previous attempts at reconstructing hosts of MERS coronavirus lineages, we chose a method that can quantify differences in viral population sizes between camels and humans," he said. "If you imagine that you are led into a dark room and you're allowed to make sound, chances are you would be able to tell something about the size of the room from the way the sound echoes. If you were led into 2 [dark] rooms of different sizes, you could probably tell that one room is smaller than the other simply from the way it echoes. For us, we're able to tell which host the virus is in by looking at genetic relatedness of sampled viruses."

Understanding how a new virus spreads -- whether 10 new cases arise from a single introduction, for example, or 10 separate introductions -- is key to getting the public health response right. The analysis published today [16 Jan 2018], according to Bedford, confirms that the global health community's focus on developing a vaccine for camels is a smart approach.

"Because the human cases are part of small sporadic chains, you'd have to vaccinate a whole bunch of people who will never be at risk," said Bedford. "It may make sense to roll out a vaccine specifically for livestock handlers, but even there, you'd probably get a very small result; most of them aren't going to get MERS. But almost all camels are getting MERS and transmitting it forward, so by vaccinating camels, you should be able to abate the overall epidemic and bring the virus down."

[The article referred to in the above press release is: Dudas, G, Carvalho LM, Rambaut A, Bedford T. MERS-CoV spillover at the camel-human interface. Jan 16, 2018, eLife 2018;7:e31257 DOI: 10.7554/eLife.31257 [full article available at: https://elifesciences.org/articles/31257].

Abstract
"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus from camels causing significant mortality and morbidity in humans in the Arabian Peninsula. The epidemiology of the virus remains poorly understood, and while case-based and seroepidemiological studies have been employed extensively throughout the epidemic, viral sequence data have not been utilised to their full potential. Here we use existing MERS-CoV sequence data to explore its phylodynamics in 2 of its known major hosts, humans and camels. We employ structured coalescent models to show that long-term MERS-CoV evolution occurs exclusively in camels, whereas humans act as a transient, and ultimately terminal host. By analysing the distribution of human outbreak cluster sizes and zoonotic introduction times we show that human outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula are driven by seasonally varying zoonotic transfer of viruses from camels. Without heretofore unseen evolution of host tropism, MERS-CoV is unlikely to become endemic in humans."

The authors demonstrated that a genomic epidemiologic study supports a conclusion that, up to the present, humans still represent a dead-end host for the MERS-CoV, but rather there are repetitive introductions of the virus from the Camelid host, the dromedary camel resident in the Middle East. A similar conclusion was reached by Cotten et al. Transmission and evolution of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Saudi Arabia: a descriptive genomic study. Lancet. 2013; 382(9909):1993-2002 [available at: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)61887-5/fulltext] with a very sound recommendation for continued development of a camel vaccine to prevent active infection in camels as the most logical approach to eliminate transmission of the virus.

It would be very interesting to see a similar modeling approach as applied in this study to the outbreak in South Korea, with 185 secondary cases following a single individual introducing it to the healthcare environment in South Korea. That outbreak resulted in 4-5 generations of cases with a single original introduction of the virus (possibly from unknown camel exposure or perhaps fomite exposure in the environment), with 5 identified "super-spreaders" responsible for 83 percent of the cases. One wonders whether the R0 in that outbreak would still be calculated at 0.90 as proposed in this paper, or whether the R0 was at epidemic levels and the genomic studies on the implicated virus(es) might show changes consistent with evolutionary changes of the virus(es). - Mod.MPP]

[The paper's essential conclusions appear in its Discussion section as follows:

"MERS cases trickled slowly and were restricted to the Arabian Peninsula or resulted in self-limiting outbreaks outside of the region, a pattern strongly indicative of repeat zoonotic spillover. Even though our results show that MERS-CoV does not appear to present an imminent global threat, we would like to highlight that its epidemiology is nonetheless concerning.

"Since its emergence in 2012, MERS-CoV has caused self-limiting outbreaks in humans with no evidence of worsening outbreaks over time.

"However, sustained evolution of the virus in the reservoir and continued flow of viral lineages into humans provides the substrate for a more transmissible variant of MERS-CoV to possibly emerge. Previous modeling studies suggest a positive relationship between initial R0 in the human host and probability of evolutionary emergence of a novel strain which passes the supercritical threshold of R0 greater than 1.0. This leaves MERS-CoV in a precarious position; on one hand its current R0 of approximately 0.7 is certainly less than 1, but its proximity to the supercritical threshold raises alarm. With very little known about the fitness landscape or adaptive potential of MERS-CoV, it is incredibly challenging to predict the likelihood of the emergence more transmissible variants. In light of these difficulties, we encourage continued genomic surveillance of MERS-CoV in the camel reservoir and from sporadic human cases to rapidly identify a supercritical variant, if one does emerge".

Trevor Bedford's comment, as cited in Fred Hutch News, indicating that the preferred approach to protect public health against MERS is camel vaccination, sounds sensible indeed. However efforts to apply such measure will have to cope with the need to convince camel owners to vaccinate (if/when the vaccine becomes available) their animals against a virus which is not regarded by them as a considerable (or any) threat to animal health. The direct MERS threat to the camel holders themselves is yet to be demonstrated. One other point yet to be clarified is the continuing difference of human MERS incidence in Saudi Arabia compared with other Middle Eastern countries. - Mod.AS]
