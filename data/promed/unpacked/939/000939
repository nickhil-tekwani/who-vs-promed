The UN humanitarian office (OCHA) said preparations were underway to avoid a cholera outbreak in Afghanistan after Wednesday's [22 Jun 2022] earthquake, saying that half a million cases of acute, watery diarrhea had already been reported. "Cholera outbreaks in the aftermath of earthquakes are of particular and serious concern," OCHA said in a statement on Thursday [23 Jun 2022]. "Preparations to avoid an outbreak are underway."

OCHA also said it was seeking to confirm that search and rescue operations were nearly finished, after Taliban authorities indicated late on that they were 90% completed.

[2] Diarrhea - Bangladesh: flooding related

Waterborne diseases are spreading in the flood-hit regions of Bangladesh as floodwater started receding. "Many people are suffering from diarrhea, skin diseases, dysentery, cholera, and other waterborne diseases," directorate general of Health Services (DGHS) sources said.

In the past 24 hours, a total of 452 people have been affected by diarrhoea in 4 flood-hit divisions -- Sylhet, Rangpur, Chattagram, and Mymensingh -- a press release issued by the DGHS said.

To provide healthcare support to the flood-affected regions of the country, as many as 2050 medical teams have been working since the beginning of the flood, it added. Officials said people of the flood-affected areas in Bangladesh are returning home as the flood situation is improving continuously.

"Flood in the northeastern and northern region is improving gradually as both Bangladesh and upstream regions of India witnessed less rainfall in the past 3 days," Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) spokesman Md Arifuzzaman Bhuyan told BSS. "Country's major rivers are flowing below danger levels at most monitoring stations . . . meaning, flood situation is an improving trend," he added.

Bhuiyan, an FFWC executive engineer, said heavy downpours inside Bangladesh and the upstream region of India triggered devastating floods in Brahmaputra and Meghna basins.

Monsoon rains and gushing waters from upstream India worsened Bangladesh's flood situation with experts calling it the worst since 2004, while millions of people have been affected by the deluge, the FFWC official said. Northeastern and northern parts of Bangladesh may witness prolonged floods as record-breaking rainfalls were recorded inside Bangladesh and upstream states of India during the ongoing flood.

"We have seen that both Bangladesh and upstream states of Meghalaya and Assam and western Himalayan regions of India recorded heavy rainfall, the highest in over 100 years," Professor Md Mansur Rahman of the Institute of Water and Flood Management of BUET said.

Major rivers and their tributaries of Bangladesh have no capacity to contain such a huge volume of rains, which ultimately has caused massive flooding in northeastern and northern regions of the country, he added. Mansur said there is a huge gap between Bangladesh and upstream regions of India in terms of elevation from sea level. "So the onrush of water enters Bangladesh with a faster pace, which inundated vast areas of the country in a shorter time," he added.

The hydrologist said a large number of embankments have been built in both Bangladesh and Indian regions to control the flow of water of major rivers, which are the main reasons for the increasing frequency of flooding.

Dr Chuman Lal Das, director at the Department Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, said that 12 persons of different places have been tested positive for cholera. "Cholera has been detected in Dillibazaar, Bagbazaar, Kapan, Thankot, Balkhu, Naikap, and Sanepa, among other places of Kathmandu," he said.

The 2 patients, who were admitted to Teku Hospital on 16 Jun [2022], were tested positive for the deadly disease. Cholera has been confirmed in stool samples of the patients. Both are from the same family.

The Department of Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has urged the general public to be vigilant to control cholera.
