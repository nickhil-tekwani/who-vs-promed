CYST NEMATODE, MAIZE - USA (TENNESSEE): NEW SPECIES

Nematologists have discovered a new cyst nematode in soil samples
taken from a field in northwestern Tennessee in 2006. The report was
confirmed in July 2007. The samples taken from soil around stunted
corn plants revealed juveniles and lemon-shaped cysts. The nematode
has physical characteristics that differentiate it from _Heterodera_
species, including the corn cyst nematode, _Heterodera zeae_. Genetic
analyses confirmed the cysts differed from _H. zeae_, but resulted in
a match with cyst specimens collected in Tennessee in 1978 from
goosegrass (_Eleusine indica_). So far, the nematode is reported to
reproduce well on a variety of hybrid corn cultivars, but reproduced
poorly on other monocots that were tested. No dicot hosts have been
reported.
If this nematode spreads to other crop production systems or areas,
it could make differentiation from other cyst nematodes difficult,
particularly if sampling and monitoring programs are in place.

[Spread of this new cyst nematode could seriously hinder field soil sampling as
well as research on the biology and management of soybean and maize cyst
nematodes. Eggs of all cyst nematodes look similar and cannot be distinguished
by appearance. Determining, for example, soybean cyst nematode (SCN) egg
population densities for management or research purposes would be impossible
using current techniques if other cyst nematodes were present. A method that is
specific for SCN eggs currently is not available, and developing such a method
could take years.
Cyst nematodes known to affect maize are _Heterodera zeae_, _H.
avenae_ (cereal cyst nematode), _H. schachtii_ (sugarbeet cyst
nematode) and _Punctodera chalcoensis_. _H. zeae_ can cause yield
losses of up to 40 percent. It was 1st reported from India and is now
known to be present also in Pakistan, parts of Egypt and the US.
Symptoms are stunting, yellowing, and narrowing of leaves. Stunting
frequently occurs in irregular patches, and development of tassels
may be noticeably delayed. Other hosts include millet, oat, rice,
sorghum, sugar cane, and wheat, as well as several grasses.
Another member of the genus is the soybean cyst nematode, _H. glycines_.
Disease management for cyst nematodes includes crop rotation and the
use of partly resistant cultivars to keep populations low.
Elimination of cyst nematodes from infected fields is usually not
possible.
It is estimated that a very large number of nematode species remains
yet to be discovered.
