[The Departrment of Animal Health publishes a daily news communique titled "Situation of AI, FMD and PRRS and prevention and control activities (d.m.y=date)". Since 4 Jun 2015, 6 such communications have been added; no new FMD cases reported (for example, see the news item of 11 Jun 2015 at http://www.cucthuy.gov.vn/Pages/news_detail.aspx?NewsId=911).

According to the page of the "Socialist Republic of Vietnam" in the web-site of the World Reference Laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD), Vietnam's current FMD status is "endemic", with 3 serotypes identified since 1999: Serotype 'O' (last recorded in 2014), 'A' (last recorded 2014) and 'Asia 1' (last recorded 2009).

Samples for serotyping and genotyping have been submitted from Vietnam to the WRLFMD each year since 2009. During 2014, 2 serotypes, including 3 genotypes, were identified as follows:

FMD-O: topotype ME-SA, lineage PanAsia
FMD-O: topotype SEA, lineage Mya-98
FMD-A: topotype ASIA, lineageSea-97.

For further details, including the respective dendrograms, please visit http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/vit.htm.

Another commendable/useful website: http://www.seafmd-rcu.oie.int/, where monthly reports from each of the 8 countries (including Vietnam) participating in OIE's regional coordinating Unit SEAFMD, are available. According to the said source, 63 accumulated new FMD outbreaks have been reported from Vietnam during 2014. 28 of them were FMDV-O, 12 FMDV-A, 23 not sampled. The most recent month covered in 2015 data is May. - Mod.AS
