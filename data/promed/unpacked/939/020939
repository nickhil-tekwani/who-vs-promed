[The last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan was 8 days ago. According to the report above, a total of 82 052 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 3339 deaths, representing an increase of 99 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (10 Apr 2020) report, with no reported deaths.

A total of 30 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. The identification of infections in imported cases, tracing their contacts, and preventing the recurrence of community-wide transmission present a new challenge for the Chinese Public health authorities.

[4] Iran: 71 686 total cases, 4474 deaths
Date: Sat 11 Apr 2020
Source: Radio Farda (based on reporting by dpa, AFP, Reuters) [edited]
https://en.radiofarda.com/a/covid-19-iran-reopens-low-risk-businesses/30547685.html


Iran has reopened some "low-risk" businesses in most parts of the country with the exception of the capital, Tehran, where they will restart from 18 Apr 2020, according to the state news agency IRNA.

IRNA said President Hassan Rouhani urged Iranians to respect health protocols as the country struggles to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

"Easing restrictions does not mean ignoring health protocols ... social distancing and other health protocols should be respected seriously by people," Rouhani was quoted as saying.

The Tasnim news agency reported that the country's Chamber of Trade Unions has submitted to the government a list of "low-risk" businesses that include patisseries, confectioneries, and other shops whose activities don't require many people.

With more than 70 000 officially reported cases, Iran is the Middle East's worst-hit country by the coronavirus crisis.

The government is also concerned that measures to shut down businesses and halt economic activities to contain the virus could wreck an already sanctions-battered economy.

IRNA quoted government spokesman Ali Rabeie as saying on 11 Apr 2020 that "in the case of a long-term shutdown, some 4 million people could be out of work."

"Four million non-state employees face a stoppage or reduction in activities, a reduction of salaries, and expulsion," Rabeie said.

Iran's economy is suffering under intense U.S. sanctions after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

Iran announced its 1st coronavirus cases on 19 Feb 2020. Many experts have repeatedly said that the real number of deaths and infections in the country could be higher than reported by Iranian officials.

[Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in Spain is starting to decrease. That being said, Spain is now 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, having surpassed Italy. From a high of 9222 cases reported in 24 hours on 31 Mar 2020, there has been a gradual decline in daily cases reported so that recent days have shown a lowering to levels of 4000s and 5000s.

As of today [11 Apr 2020], totals of 161 852 cases and 16 972 deaths have been reported, up from 157 022 cases and 15 843 deaths in the preceding 24 hours. The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 197.5, slowly decreasing over the past 6 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 197.5 today. Spain has the highest case count in Europe and 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 161 852 cases, approximately 68 050 (42.0%) have been hospitalized and 7535 (4.6%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data.)

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7216161,43. La Rioja, Navarre, and Basque Country are located together in the north of the country. Madrid is in the northern part of central Spain, and Castile-La Mancha is just to the south of Madrid, with Toledo as its capital. - Mod.UBA]
