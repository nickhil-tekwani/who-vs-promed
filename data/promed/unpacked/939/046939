Switzerland: ongoing measles outbreak; results from November 2006 to July 2007
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After some sporadic cases and small outbreaks (43 cases) during the
1st semester of 2006, and a 4-month period of low measles activity (3
cases), an outbreak of measles was detected in the canton of Lucerne
in November 2006. From then until 17 Jul 2007, 483 cases were
reported by physicians or laboratories for the whole country. This is
10 times more than the average number of cases reported for the
corresponding period over the past 8 years (mandatory surveillance of
measles was introduced in 1999). Of these, 279 cases (58 percent)
occurred in the canton of Lucerne. The incidence for the whole
country and all ages, calculated for the 8-month period from November
2006 to July 2007, was 6.5 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. For
children under the age of 16 years living in the canton of Lucerne,
it was 343 per 100 000.
Outbreak description
--------------------
The 1st 5 known cases, who were 8 to 9 year-old children living in
the town of Lucerne, fell ill almost simultaneously in mid-November
[2006]. Of these, 4 reported an exposure at school. The origin of the
outbreak is unknown. Since then, the disease has spread to the
neighbouring countryside; further outbreaks were reported in other
cantons: Bern (especially in the area of Biel) in February [2007] (68
cases), Geneva in March [2007] and again in May [2007] (37 cases),
and Zug in April [2007] (26 cases). These outbreaks are still
ongoing. Of 26 cantons, 19 reported at least one measles case. No
epidemiological links between the outbreaks have been confirmed, but
27 viral strains obtained from the saliva of cases from different
parts of the country -- including the first cases in Lucerne --
belonged to the D5 genotype. The only exception was one B3 virus that
was probably imported from Italy. Exactly the same D5 sequences were
recently identified in a Japanese student visiting Canada, and D5
measles viruses were involved in a large outbreak in Japanese
universities last spring [2007], suggesting a possible importation of
measles from Japan to Switzerland (1,2). The monthly number of cases
has been increasing steadily over this 8-month period, reaching a
maximum of 108 cases in June [2007] [illustrated by a figure in the
original text].
Most cases (57 percent) have been confirmed, either by a positive IgM
or PCR [polymerase chain reaction] result (45 percent of the total
cases), or by an epidemiological link with a laboratory confirmed
case (12 percent of the total cases). Of the cases, 34 percent
fulfilled only the clinical case definition (fever and rash, as well
as cough or rhinitis or conjunctivitis), whereas in 9 percent of the
cases, clinical data were not yet available or did not completely
fulfill the case definition.
Males constituted 53 percent of the cases. [The age distribution of
the cases is illustrated by a figure in the original text]. Half of
them were aged between 5 and 14 years. The median age was 10 years.
Of the 445 cases for which a detailed questionnaire had been
submitted, 6 percent were vaccinated against measles (18 with one
dose and 9 with 2 doses), 87 percent were unvaccinated, and the
vaccination status of the remaining 7 percent was unknown. There were
43 cases (10 percent) requiring hospitalisation. Among 445 cases for
which information about complications was available, 4 cases were
reported with encephalitis (one percent), all among children, 29
cases with pneumonia (7 percent, median age 10 years), and 31 cases
with otitis media (7 percent). No deaths were reported.
Control measures
----------------
Various measures were taken by the cantonal medical authorities to
control this outbreak. They included targeted information, such as
letters to the parents in the implicated schools and day-care
centres, letters to the doctors of the affected areas, as well as
general information through the media and the Bulletin of the Federal
Office of Public Health [3,4]. This information contained
recommendations to check the vaccination status of children and young
adults and to complete immunisation if necessary. In specific cases,
contact tracing was carried out to prevent (vaccination or
administration of immunoglobulin) and detect new cases. In at least 2
cantons, non-immune siblings of the index cases were asked to stay at
home, in order to limit the transmission to schools.
Discussion
----------
Measles is a highly contagious disease, with a secondary attack rate
of over 90 percent among non-immune contacts. During this outbreak, a
large variety of different settings for transmission were identified,
such as families, schools, an anthroposophic boarding school,
day-care centres, ski camps, sport clubs, a military accommodation
facility, a cinema, planes, an airport, and 'measles parties'
(voluntary exposure of children to an infected person).
The current ongoing outbreak clearly shows that measles is not only a
childhood disease: 28 percent of the cases were 16 years-old or
older. With one patient out of 10 hospitalised, sometimes with severe
complications, it also shows that measles, even in children, cannot
be considered a mild disease. Two groups were involved in particular:
children and teenagers whose parents did not wish them to be
vaccinated, and to a lesser extent, young adults who were not
immunised because they were born before the introduction of a general
measles vaccination programme and who had not been infected during
childhood due to an already reduced circulation of the virus. The 1st
recommendation for measles vaccination dates from 1976, but an active
promotion campaign for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination
was started only in 1987.
The best protection against measles and its complications remains the
widespread vaccination of young children. In Switzerland, this
vaccination is voluntary and reimbursed by mandatory private health
insurance. It includes 2 doses of MMR vaccine, one at the age of 12
months and another at the age of 15 to 24 months [5]. A catch-up
vaccination is recommended for anyone under the age of 40 who has no
documented vaccination, or no reliable history of having had measles
or specific antibodies. Despite a slight increase in recent years,
the measles vaccination coverage in Switzerland remains significantly
below the 95 percent necessary for measles elimination [6] .The
coverage for one dose is about 86 percent at 2 years of age (78
percent in the canton of Lucerne), 89 percent at school entry, and 95
percent at the age of 16 years. Overall it reaches only 70 to 75
percent for the 2nd dose.
In addition to this insufficient vaccination coverage, the frequent
lack of appropriate measures to control sporadic cases and beginning
outbreaks (there is no national plan of action for measles
elimination yet) still allows measles outbreaks to occur in
Switzerland, sometimes with large numbers of patients: 6400 estimated
cases in 1997, 613 reported cases in 2003 [7], and 483 cases so far
this year [2007]. Thus, under the current conditions, it is unlikely
that the WHO's goal to eliminate measles from Europe will be achieved by 2010.

[Of greatest interest in this analysis is the suspected introduction
of the virus into Switzerland from Japan. Japan has been considered
also to have been the source of outbreaks of measles in Canada, the
USA, and Taiwan earlier in the year (2007) and concerns have been
expressed about the adequacy of the measles vaccination programme in
Japan (see ProMED-mail references below) - Mod.CP]
