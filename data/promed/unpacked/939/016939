[Reporting of newly confirmed cases by the Saudi MOH seems to have slowed down with a total of 4 newly confirmed cases reported since 1 Feb 2017 as compared with 12 newly confirmed cases reported during the 1st 11 days of January 2017. In this currently update, there were 3 newly confirmed cases reported in the past 9 days, 1 each from Najran, Madinah, and Makkah. During this slowdown, the MOH has not been posting daily reports, with the presumption on my part that the missing days were days with no newly confirmed cases nor reports of deaths nor recoveries. That being said, the numbers I have on the total number of currently active cases, fatalities and recoveries differs from those maintained on the Saudi MOH.

Maps of Saudi Arabia showing the locations of the newly confirmed cases, reported fatalities and recoveries can be found at the source URLs. - Mod.MPP]
