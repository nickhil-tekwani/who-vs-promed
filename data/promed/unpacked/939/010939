Enclosed are some additional details on the current Swiss BSE-surveillance
scheme to respond to the moderators comments.
The current Swiss BSE surveillance scheme has been described in detail in a
February 25, 1999 posting to ProMED/Ahead (Swiss BSE surveillance expanded
for 1999). In short, in addition to the mandatory reporting of all suspect
cases (based on clinical neurological symptoms), all dead cattle showing at
least 4 permanent teeth, i.e. being over 24 months of age, that are brought
to the single rendering plant designated for fallen stock (approx. 6500 /
year) are sampled. Also, brain samples are collected from all adult cattle
subject to emergency slaughter (approx. 2500 / year), and from a random
sample of cattle showing at least 4 permanent teeth at regular slaughter,
bringing the total sample size up to at least 16500 animals.
All brain samples are tested for the presence of PrP(Sc) using the Prionics
Western Blot, and test-positive samples are confirmed through the Swiss
reference laboratory for animal TSE by histology or immuncytochemistry.
Between January 1 and November 9, 1999, 19 clinical cases of BSE have been
reported to the authorities (passive surveillance). Two of those animals
were born before the official feed ban in December of 1990, the others were
born between December 1990 and June 1995. None of these animals was less
than 49 months old.
During the same time period, 22 cattle (15 in fallen stock, 5 in emergency
slaughter and 2 in routine slaughter) were detected in the active
surveillance with the Prionics Western Blot. All of those animals were born
after the feed ban of Dec. 1990, and the youngest animal was born in
December of 1995. All affected cattle were older than 43 months of age. It
currently is assumed that infections after the MBM (meat and bone meal) ban
of 1990 are the result of cross-contamination (during production or
transport) of feedstuff designed for cattle with feedstuff containing
ruminant-derived MBM produced for poultry or pigs. Before 1996, so called
high-risk material (including brains and spinal cords from slaughtered
cattle, some of them certainly infected with BSE) was still included in the
MBM designated for non-ruminant feedstuff. No other likely source of BSE
infection has been identified in Switzerland.
Since mid-1996, all high-risk material and all fallen stock in Switzerland
is incinerated, and it is assumed that no new infections have occurred after
that date. This can not be fully assessed before the year 2001, however, the
fact that until now (even with the intensified surveillance) no cases
younger than 43 months of age have been detected, and the proportion of
cases detected in 1999 that were born in 1995 is considerably lower than to
be expected from the November results of previous years, is an indication
that the BSE epidemic is still constantly decreasing. This is in agreement
with our modeling results.
In summary, the higher number of BSE cases in Switzerland in 1999, when
compared to the 1998 figures, is the result of an strongly improved
surveillance (better case ascertainment), and all available evidence points
towards an ongoing decrease in the epidemic in line with all model
predictions.
