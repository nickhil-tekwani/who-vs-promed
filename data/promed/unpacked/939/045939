According to a communiqu√© released by Poland's Chief Veterinary Officer, the number of ASF-confirmed wild boar in the Lubuskie Voivodeship, western Poland, has risen to 20. This is based on the results of research carried out at the National Veterinary Institute-National Research Institute in Pulawy. The samples were collected in 9 locations in Wschowa and Nowa Sol counties, during the searches undertaken in the contaminated area and a buffer zone around it, established on the basis of risk analysis.

Due to the ASF's spread in Lubuskie, a new ordinance, addressing the said voivodship, has been published. The area contaminated with the virus has been designated in the counties ("poviats") Wschowa, Nowa Sol and Zielona Gora [see map in the commentary below].

Forest searches are underway since Sat 16 Nov 2019. Since Tue 19 Nov, the army has joined the activities. The affected area is fenced. The Chief Veterinary Officer informs that the location of the construction of the 2nd external fence is under planning.

From Tue 19 Nov 2019, the bridge of the bike path connecting Otyn and Nowa Sol is closed until further notice. Due to the detection of ASF in the municipality of Slawa [Wschowa County], it is strictly forbidden to enter the forest until further notice.
