Low strain bird flu found in TT
-----------------------------------
The agriculture Ministry yesterday [18 Aug 2006] announced that a
"low pathogenic strain" of avian influenza (AI) has been detected at
a farm in Central Trinidad. The Ministry said it should not be
confused with the H5N1 strain of AI that is responsible for deaths in
Asia and Western Europe.
The Ministry said the low pathogenic strain of AI (LPAI) "does not
pose a significant threat to human beings."
In a release issued after 5 pm yesterday [18 Aug 2006], the Ministry
said the strain was discovered during routine surveillance for the
presence of the H5N1 strain of AI.
It said LPAI is found in bird populations throughout the world and
its occurrence in TT "is not surprising." The disease does not have
severe signs, which is why it is deemed a low pathogen.
"It does have some agricultural significance, as it may cause deaths
in poultry, although the impact on the country's poultry industry is
expected to be negligible," the release stated.
Samples have been sent to the United Kingdom for verification, and
the Ministry said measures are being implemented to contain the
spread of the disease.
The Ministry is taking a "positive" view of the identification of
LPAI, saying it provided proof that measures implemented to detect
bird flu were effective. No information was available regarding
culling of birds at the farm, which was not identified.
Bird deaths at a farm in Cumuto earlier this year [2006] caused
chicken sales to plummet across the country, as people feared
contracting H5N1. The deaths were linked to aspergillosis, a fungal
infection, and thousands of birds had to be culled at Cumuto.

[The article does not tell us what strain of avian influenza this is.
Even though it is thought to be a strain of low pathogenicity, if it
is H5 or H7, it is reportable to the OIE. Indeed, it does indicate
their surveillance is working. However, we would like to know what
strain of avian influenza has been discovered. Perhaps more
information will be available when a report from the UK has been
received. - Mod.TG]
