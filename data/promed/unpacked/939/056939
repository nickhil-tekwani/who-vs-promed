I am a Japanese veterinarian living in Japan now, however I had been
living in the USA almost 15 years but I had not heard about Lobster
sushi in Japanese sushi bars there. Lobster meat is too tough for eating
raw because it has lots of muscle tendon.
Of course Japanese eat raw sweet shrimp (Japanese Amaebi) but not
lobster sushi.
