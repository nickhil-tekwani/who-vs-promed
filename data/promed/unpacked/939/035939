Malaria Epidemic in Burundi
---------------------------------
Burundi is currently suffering a malaria epidemic of unprecedented
proportions. At least 6 of the country's 16 provinces are affected. More
than 720 000 cases were registered in the country in November, including 60
435 new cases in the province of Kayanza (which has a population of
approximately 510 000 people), and more than 46 000 in the area of Musema,
the most affected in the province.
The mortality rates are alarming. A survey carried out by Doctors Without
Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in this sector between 13 Oct and 6
Dec 2000 estimated the mortality rate of children under 5 years at 3.8 for
10 000 people per day, well above the emergency threshold of 2 for 10 000
people per day. The figures show that 1000 people died from malaria during
this period, half of whom were children under 5.
In collaboration with the Burundian health authorities, MSF is working in 3
provinces that have been particularly affected: Kayanza, Ngozi, and Karuzi
(with a total population of 1.4 million). The teams diagnose and treat
patients as well as provide drugs and materials to 16 health centers in
these provinces.
"Our teams are faced with a huge influx of people presenting signs of
malaria," explains Colette Gadenne, head of mission for MSF in Burundi. "In
the health center of Muhanga alone, there are up to 600 patients a day. The
Burundian medical staff is overwhelmed and many centers have run out of
anti-malarial drugs." Furthermore, since the beginning of the epidemic, it
is mostly adults that come to the health centers. "Many children may have
died from lack of timely treatment," adds Colette Gadenne.
To improve access to health care in the provinces of Kayanza, Ngozi, and
Karuzi, 8 mobile teams have been set up around 20 sites. Each team treats a
minimum of 200 patients a day. A vector control program has also been set
up in Kayanza: 9000 houses spread over 27 hills are to be sprayed with
insecticide in December by a team of over 100 people. 2000 houses will
likewise be sprayed in the province of Karuzi and 15 000 impregnated
mosquito nets will be distributed.
There is great concern at the renewed outbreaks of malaria in Burundi. Last
year there were over 2 million cases (for 6 million inhabitants), compared
to 200 000 cases 10 years ago. The current epidemic has erupted in medium-
to low-endemic areas. The population is therefore less immune, which
explains the explosion in the number of cases and the high mortality. The
development of planting in marshland in which vector mosquitoes
proliferate, the cessation of vector control programs, and the probable
resistance to chloroquine may help to explain this epidemic.
The protocols adopted are chloroquine/fansidar for simple cases of malaria
and quinine for severe malaria. However, in the context of this epidemic,
MSF requests the support of the World Health Organization (WHO) and its
Roll Back Malaria Department in the use of combination therapies based on
artemisinine derivatives. These associations would offer more effective
rapid treatment and would thus be better prepared to control the epidemic.
MSF has been present in Burundi since 1992, and its teams have been
reinforced to cover this epidemic. There are currently 24 volunteers and
400 national staff working in 3 provinces.

[Epidemics of malaria usually occur in areas with otherwise low levels of
transmission. It would be important in this situation to have some data on
transmission and climate to evaluate whether the epidemic is due to some
unusual climatic circumstances and/or changes in vector behavior. From the
posting it seems that chloroquine may still be effective in uncomplicated
cases, but it is reasonable to expect that chloroquine resistance will be
encountered, as it is highly prevalent in Malawi and Tanzania. The best
protection against such epidemics is surveillance of the vector and cases
to enable early warning. - Mod.EP]
