In the report "Coccidiodomycosis - USA (CA)" (archive number
20070817.2692) we listed an incorrect byline. The original article
from the Sacramento Bee was written by Andy Furillo. The article was
sent to us by ProMED-mail rapporteur Joe Dudley, but he was not the
author of the piece. ProMED apologizes for the error.
