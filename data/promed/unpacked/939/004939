> 2. Compliance with Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) is
contingent upon risk evaluation. In the absence of an approved and
formalised system of quantitative risk assessment, and of generally
accepted levels of tolerable and unacceptable risk, the EC is perfectly
entitled to aim for a different level of health protection than that
considered sufficient by other parties.<
The second point [shown above. MHJ begs the question of international
standardization of quantitative risk assessment. If this is considered a
prerequisite to compliance with the IHR then there will be a very long
wait. The EU is not a member of WHO but the individual economies of the EU
are ... this is a very interesting (and correct) point of treaty law which
suggests that other trading unions and cooperations may also be exempt from
the IHR although their individual economies have approved them.
In essence, as Bruce Plotkin and I summarized in our article (EMERGING
INFECTIONS 1997:3(1) 1-9.) on the international policy situation, it is
proving to be as important as we predicted for WTO and WHO to collectively
work to assure that there is a viable legal framework within which such
issues of trade sanctions can be resolved.
