[The locations of the 2 new outbreaks in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, the 1st one in November 2009 and the current one, are
indicated on the map included in the OIE report.

In view of the continued stamping-out policy in the FMDV-A outbreaks
in China, and the continued use of the term "new strain of a listed
disease", additional information on the evolution of this epizootic in
China and the availability (or otherwise) of an efficacious vaccine
are requested. Information from other countries in the region (such as
Viet Nam & S Korea) may be indicative of the invasive character of
this strain. It will be also interesting to obtain updated information
on the current FMD situation in the country dividing South Korea from
China, namely North Korea. - Mod.AS]
