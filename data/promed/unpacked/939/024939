[While we await the 'official' comments from USDA/APHIS/VS, the following
provides some valuable insights into this test. mod MHJ

Some information very kindly provided by an exhausted Dr. Katherine
O'Rourke, WSU, Pullman in an 16 Apr 98 on-site interview, per my best
recollection:
1. A monoclonal antibody to a prion peptide was used. This is the only way
to go if the method is to be consistently transferable to different labs and
never run out of antibody. It does not distinguish rogue from normal
conformer like Swiss 15B3 but works adequately in US sheep third eyelid
lymphoid tissue, apparently. Despite the patents, this antibody is readily
available to any qualified researcher: korourke@vetmed.wsu.edu.
2. Their main method was to purchase "high-risk" lambs from a 1000 mile
radius of Pullman, Washington. These amounted to lambs born to ewes with
confirmed scrapie, be it maternal or from shed agent. The test works at the
18 month level; these sheep typically display scrapie at 3 years or longer,
so it is a real breakthrough in terms of non-invasive pre-clinical
"on-the-hoof" testing. 14-3-3 is not competitive in this regard. Having a
test at 18 months is not the total answer to eradicating scrapie, but it
can't help but help. The slow-onset carrier problem continues to be vexatious.
3. There will be a conventional peer-reviewed paper out in a couple of
weeks. The journal editor does not wish to be bothered by the press in the
interim so the journal name is not being given out. I am guessing that the
high-risk lambs had dramatically higher total eyelid prion than low-risk
lambs and that the alleles carried are known high-risk. The June issue of
the J. Clin Microbiol. is apparently a different article.
Ruminants differ from primates in that there is tremendous activity in
Peyer's patches during the first days as opposed to wholesale uptake of IgG
across the placenta, it is absolutely imperative that the lamb's immune
system be primed against infection early on.
4. However, the lab is now focused on elk ranch CWD where they are
getting excellent cooperation from an industry that wants eradication. Seems
that elk produce far less prion than, say, mule deer, and the eyelid test
may not work on them though tonsils could. GA Wells [Dept Pathology,
CVL/MAFF/UK is looking into applicability of the eyelid test to UK scrapie,
no one is saying at this point that the test will work on UK strains of
scrapie.
This is an interesting point put forward by O'Rourke, that different species
may inherently produce different basal levels of normal prion protein,
leading to differential susceptibility through mass action. O'Rourke
suggest, for the origin of CWD, that mule deer population genetics could be
so localized that a bad allele might have surfaced; while this is not
totally inviable, I see severe selection working against this as deer are
struck down in their reproductive prime.
5. They are not calling this an official 'test' yet pending the fate of
various control sheep that tested negative on the eyelid test, false
negatives and all that, with the limitation that the sheep cannot be housed
in separated pens that meet federal standards due to the limited size of
eastern Washington; however, the incubation period is long enough that
conclusions can still be somewhat safely drawn.
6. They have their hands full with scrapie and CWD aspects and are not
working on extending the test to BSE at this time. Without getting into
comparative third eyelidology, the test is not applicable to CJD. Again, the
sampling takes 25 minutes with two people and does not require general
anesthesia; antibody is available to any qualified researcher from
korourke@vetmed.wsu.edu.
7. There has also been some dramatic improvements at ARS, Ames, Iowa, in
the form of Dr. Mary Jo Schmerr's latest capillary electrophoresis
immunoassay with fluorescent peptides, Electrophoresis 1998 19 409-414,
which is specifically for the rogue isoform.
8. One question that wasn't fully clarified during our talk was how a lab
out in the wheat fields with one researcher and one lab tech could get a
result like this that has long evaded bigger labs with staffs of 75+ and
gargantuan budgets over decades.
