During the 1st months of 2018, many cats have developed salmonellosis. The disease has also been confirmed in small birds, which is the likely source of infection for the cats according to the Swedish Veterinary Medicine Agency (SVA).

About 10 people have now been infected with _Salmonella_ types common to small birds and cats. For some cases, there is also a confirmed connection to a cat with salmonellosis. The majority who have been infected are children in pre-school age. The cases are located in Kalmar, Stockholm, Varmland, Vastra Gotaland, Orebro, and Ostergotland counties.

Since salmonella can infect human beings from small birds and cats, hand hygiene is important. Wash your hands thoroughly after cleaning the litter boxes and after contact with the birdfeeder, and as always before handling food. Gloves protect when handling dead or sick birds. Also pay attention to the symptoms in family cats. Children, especially young children, should not come into contact with a cat who is ill.

The State Veterinary Office (SVA) has detected 1007 cases of salmonella in cats in just over 2 months since the beginning of 2018. Never before, even in a whole year, so many cats have been found to have salmonellosis in Sweden. Finally, fewer cats are now suffering from this disease.

2018 differs from previous years in 2 ways: partly because the observed cases are so many, partly because the proportion of _Salmonella_ positive samples is so high among the suspected samples obtained. Now, however, "the culmination seems to be reached for this contagion season", said Elina Lahti, epidemiologist at SVA.

Because the cats have the same subtypes of salmonella that birds carry, the cats are infected by birds, for example around the popular areas where birds are fed.

[The serotype or serotypes of _Salmonella enterica_ involved in this zoonotic cluster is not stated. The following is a reasonable review related to the subject:

Weese JS: Bacterial enteritis in dogs and cats: diagnosis, therapy, and zoonotic potential. Vet Clin North Am Small Anim Pract. 2011; 41(2): 287-309.

Abstract
--------
A variety of bacteria are known or suspected of being able to cause enteritis in dogs and cats. _Campylobacter_ spp, _Clostridium difficile_, _C. perfringens_, and _Salmonella_ spp. are most commonly implicated, but many other organisms are likely involved. Poor understanding of the intestinal microflora and the fact that many, if not all, of these microorganisms can also be found in healthy individuals complicates testing, thereby affecting the use of specific treatments and assessment of potential infection control and zoonotic disease risks. An understanding of the strengths and limitations of various diagnostic options is important for the management of canine and feline enteritis.

Sweden's policy addressing salmonellosis in animals and humans is considered as one of the most effective, globally. A severe domestic outbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium in 1953 that involved more than 9000 people prompted the need for a control programme for _Salmonella_. Since then, the strategy for control has been to prevent _Salmonella_ in all parts of the production chain, from feed to food of animal origin.

When Sweden joined the European Union in 1995, the Swedish _Salmonella_ control programme was accepted. Sweden obtained additional guarantees that food products of animal origin from countries with a non-equivalent _Salmonella_ status should be tested for the presence of _Salmonella_ before being placed on the Swedish market. These additional guarantees constitute an important safeguard to Swedish public health. Specific salmonella-targetting programmes were developed and applied by Sweden's veterinary authorities, addressing the 5 sectors -- food, animal feed, poultry, pigs, and cattle. In pigs and cattle, a combination of partial herd depopulation and hygienic measures controlled by repeated sampling is usually practised. Cattle herds that are under restrictions for _Salmonella_ are monitored by a combination of serological and bacteriological testing. Hygienic measures can include reducing the number of animals, control of animal feed and manure management on the farm and reduction of _Salmonella_ in the environment by cleaning and disinfection. Animals from restricted herds may be slaughtered after sampling with negative results.

During 2007-2016, an average of 3000 human cases of salmonellosis were reported annually to the Public Health Agency of Sweden. A majority of these (70-80 percent) were infected abroad. The low proportion of domestic infections is unique to Sweden compared to many other countries. A few larger outbreaks have been reported, the source often being imported food. The contribution to the human disease burden from farm animals is very limited.

In 2016, _Salmonella_ was detected in 489 cats: an increase, compared to previous years. Of the 951 samples from cats, submitted for analysis, 54.2 percent yielded _Salmonella_. Findings of _Salmonella_ in cats were geographically clustered: 66.7 percent of the findings were from the counties of Stockholm, Uppsala, Dalarna, and Vastra Gotaland. Most (82.4 percent) of these cases were reported in February and March. All of the 145 serotyped cat isolates belonged to the serovar Typhimurium. Also, _Salmonella_ was detected in 6 dogs, 33 wild birds (mainly passerine) and 2 hedgehogs.

The above and detailed additional information on Sweden's unique _Salmonella_ control policy, updated for 2016, is available from ref. 1 below, pages 77-90 ("Salmonellosis").

The following summary on salmonellosis in Sweden's cats is derived from a 2017 thesis (ref 2):

Summary
-------
"Salmonellosis is a zoonotic disease that for a long time has been considered rare among domestic animals in Sweden. However, since 1999 there have been reports of cyclic occurrences of clinical cases among domestic cats which most often have fallen ill in early springtime. The suspected source of infection has been wild birds. In this study an examination of data from passive surveillance of salmonella among domestic cats and wild birds has been made, collected by the Swedish Veterinary Institute (SVA) 1992-2016. Furthermore, a survey has been sent to Swedish veterinarians working with small animals, asking them how they handle diagnostics, treatment, and counseling when treating a suspected or diagnosed case of feline salmonellosis. The results show that the number of confirmed cases of salmonella among domestic cats and wild birds in Sweden has varied over the years for the last 24 years and that most cases occur from January to April. _Salmonella_ Typhimurium was the most common serotype isolated from both birds and cats and the most common subtypes were the MLVA types 2-13-3-NA-212 and 2-12-3-NA-212 and the phage types PT 40 and NST. Eurasian bullfinches (_Pyrrhula pyrrhula_), common redpolls (_Carduelis flammea_), and Eurasian siskins (_Spinus spinus_) were the birds most commonly infected with salmonella. All these species belong to the order Passeriformes and are frequent visitors of bird feeders in the winter.

"The survey showed that Swedish veterinarians generally have a good knowledge of when to suspect salmonellosis in cats, how to treat the disease, how to prevent further transmission, and what advice to give the cats' owners. It was, however, also shown that veterinarians working in the middle parts of Sweden (Svealand) as well as veterinarians working in clinics with 20 or more veterinarians employed were more likely to suspect salmonellosis given typical symptoms of the disease, compared to other veterinarians. Furthermore, it was shown that Swedish veterinarians seldom report suspected cases of salmonella to authorities and that a majority do not usually perform follow-up tests for salmonella after the cat has clinically recovered from the disease.

"As a conclusion, the fact that the same subtypes of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium can be isolated from both wild birds and domestic cats strongly indicates that the cats are indeed infected as a result of predation of wild birds. It is difficult to conclude whether the disease is becoming more prevalent in Sweden or not, due to the probability that more cases are being diagnosed as a result of more frequent testing. However, as a veterinarian working with clinical cases in small animals, one should always have a suspicion of salmonellosis when treating an outdoor-cat with typical symptoms of the disease, even at other times than early spring. It is also of utter importance to take into account the risk of transmission of salmonellosis from cats to humans as well as to other animals."
