Measles cases still on rise in South Africa
-------------------------------------------
The National Institute for Communicable Diseases has confirmed 169 laboratory-confirmed cases of measles between the 2nd week of October [2022] and the 1st week of December [2022].

The cases were reported in North West, Mpumalanga, Limpopo and Gauteng.

The NICD says the cases increased in Limpopo with 98 cases and in Mpumalanga with 50 cases.

The institute says of the 169 cases, 125 had an unknown vaccination status, 18 were vaccinated and 26 were unvaccinated.

Earlier this month [December 2022], Health Minister Joe Phaahla raised concerns about the unknown vaccination status of a significant number of people diagnosed with measles.

The NICD confirmed that the number of measles cases in the country remains on the rise.

"Four of our 9 provinces have outbreaks. It is imperative to know the signs and symptoms. Measles patients present with fever, rash, and one or more of these symptoms: cough, red eyes, and runny nose. Complications of measles include pneumonia, diarrhoea, dehydration, encephalitis, blindness and death. Measles complications are severe in malnourished children and young infants under 2 years of age. Clinicians and caregivers should be on alert for anyone presenting with the aforementioned signs and symptoms.

"Persons of any age who are not vaccinated can be infected and develop the disease. Our current measles vaccination coverage is between 75-85%, below the required coverage of 95% to stop transmission. Road-to-health booklets should be checked to ensure measles vaccinations are up-to-date. Measles vaccines are given routinely at 6 and 12 months of age. It is never too late to vaccinate against measles."

Turkana Launches Campaign To Prevent Spread Of Measles
------------------------------------------------------
Turkana Department of Health and Sanitation, in partnership with UNICEF Kenya, has launched a 10- day Measles/Rubella vaccination campaign covering the entire county and targeting 146 129 children under the age of 5 years.

The campaign came in the wake of a reported outbreak at the Kakuma Refugee Camp and the host community, where 14 cases were confirmed.

Turkana joins 6 other counties that have less than 90% coverage of the routine 1st and 2nd dose measles vaccine coverage.

Speaking during the campaign launch at Lodwar County Referral Hospital (LCRH), Health and Sanitation County Executive Committee Member Dr. Anthony Apalia said that the campaign will involve outreaches in addition to all immunizing health facilities.

"The county has witnessed reduced coverage due to highly mobile nomadic populations, an influx of refugees and the ongoing drought, which has affected a large population of vulnerable malnourished children," said Dr. Apalia.

He urged all Turkana residents to take their children to the nearest health facility for immunization. He also assured the residents that the vaccine is safe and will be administered by qualified healthcare workers.

Head of Family Health Division Gabriel Lopodo said that the campaign offers the county a 2nd chance to vaccinate the children at the community level and reach the 2nd dose defaulters as well as administer Vitamin A.

Speaking during the launch, Dr. Eriku Kidalio (Deputy Director - LCRH), Amos Ekitela Ewoi (Sub- County Medical Officer of Health,Turkana Central) and Lokaale Erot (Unicef Kenya representative) urged residents to turn out in large numbers to protect their children against the highly contagious childhood viral disease.

Other counties targeted are Garissa, Wajir, Mandera, Marsabit, West Pokot and Nairobi.

World Health Organization Kenya, UNHCR Kenya, Vaccines Kenya, Save the Children Kenya, International Rescue Committee are some of the organisations involved in the campaign.

India reports more than 10 000 confirmed measles cases through 12 Dec 2022
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Government data on measles in India was presented to the Lok Sabha today [16 Dec 2022] by Minister of State for Health Bharati Pravin Pawar which revealed a total 10 416 laboratory-confirmed cases and 40 deaths among children have been reported till 12 Dec 2022, the Hindu reports.

The report notes that the state of Maharashtra has reported the most cases with 3075 cases and 13 deaths, followed by Jharkhand with 2683 cases and 8 deaths.

The outbreaks are occurring due to accumulation of susceptible children for more than 2 years, says Dr Giridhar Babu, Epidemiologist at Public Health Foundation of India, who has worked in the National Measles programme in the past.

Containing measles once it starts spreading is hard because it is a highly contagious infectious disease.

"Up to 9 out of 10 susceptible persons with close contact to a measles patient will develop measles," explains Dr Babu.

Epidemiologist Dr Ambrish Dutta said, "We knew nothing about COVID, but we know about measles. We have a vaccine that is very effective in preventing infection, not just severe illness."

Low coverage of Measles and Rubella Containing Vaccine (MRCV) among the eligible beneficiaries due to the pandemic has left the unvaccinated kids prone to the contagious virus.

Ohio measles outbreak should be warning for parents, schools and vaccine skeptics, doctors say
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The number of children who have fallen ill with measles in and around Columbus has grown slowly but steadily since the 1st 4 cases were reported by the Columbus health department at the beginning of November [2022].

While there are still no reported cases in the Cleveland area, the recent Ohio measles outbreak -- which so far has been limited entirely to unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children -- has some doctors raising concerns that go beyond measles.

They say a combination of a complacency about diseases most people in the U.S. have rarely seen up close, and the heated debate around COVID-19 vaccinations, has sown seeds of confusion and misinformation about the safety, effectiveness and necessity of vaccines for other childhood diseases.

These small outbreaks, say doctors, should serve as a reminder of the importance of timely vaccinations in young children, because even a single exposure could be devastating in settings like daycares with rooms full of babies too young to be vaccinated. Measles is a highly contagious virus, with 90% of unvaccinated people exposed getting sick.

"Measles and polio and meningitis ... these are very serious diseases that we do not want to see come back," said Dr. Camille Sabella, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at the Cleveland Clinic. "Vaccines have basically eliminated those childhood diseases."

Seventy-seven cases of measles were reported in Central Ohio from 9 Nov 2022 through Friday [16 Dec 2022].

All the cases involved people under the age of 18, concentrated among young children. Seventy-two cases involved children under 5, including 20 who were not yet a year old. None of the children were fully vaccinated against measles. Four were partially vaccinated, having received only the 1st dose of the 2-dose series, and the rest had never been vaccinated.

Children must wait until 12 months of age to be vaccinated.

There have been no reported deaths in Ohio, but more than a quarter of the patients required hospitalization.

Globally, measles cases reached a record of nearly 900 000 in 2019, and deaths from measles topped 200 000.

The CDC reports that the U.S. had more than 1274 confirmed cases across 31 states that same year [2019], the largest resurgence of the disease since 1992.

Those numbers dropped dramatically during the pandemic. There were only 13 reported cases of measles in the U.S. during 2020, presumably as a result of lockdowns, social distancing and masking precautions.

But the pandemic delayed routine medical visits, causing some children to fall behind in their routine vaccination schedules, and stalling worldwide efforts to quell the rising tide of measles through large-scale vaccination efforts.

Now that COVID-19 restrictions have been loosened, those numbers are starting to rise again.

In countries like Madagascar, Ukraine, India and the Philippines, where vaccination rates are typically between 60% and 80%, measles still infects anywhere from 50 000 to 100 000 people per country every year.

But here in the United States, measles by health standards is considered eliminated, in that it has not spread continuously in the country for over 2 decades. Roughly 92% of children in the U.S. have received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine by 24 months of age, a number that hovers just below the 93%-95% vaccination rates required to prevent the spread of the disease.

Measles is occasionally brought into the country via exposure to a person who has traveled to a country where measles is still widespread, causing small outbreaks among unvaccinated individuals like the one in the Columbus area.

However, slipping vaccination rates amid dangerous anti-vaccine misinformation and pandemic-related disruptions to health care could push the U.S. toward a resurgence of endemic measles, doctors say. During the lengthy outbreak in 2019, the U.S. nearly lost its elimination status, and there's cause for concern this could happen again.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently warned about a drop in measles vaccination coverage in children during the COVID-19 pandemic, estimating that 40 million kids missed a measles-containing vaccine in 2021, including 25 million who missed their 1st dose and 14.7 million who missed their 2nd dose.

Amid Ohio Measles Outbreak, New Global Report Warns of Decreased Vaccination During COVID-19 Pandemic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A measles outbreak is underway this winter in central Ohio, where 73 known cases and 26 hospitalizations have occurred since late October [2022], according to health department data updated on 12 Dec 2022. The Columbus-area outbreak comes on the heels of an unrelated cluster of 22 cases in Minnesota this year [2022].

Meanwhile, an annual report from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns that substantial progress toward global measles elimination saw setbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic that put millions of children at risk for the highly contagious disease.

According to the 25 Nov 2022 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), an estimated 24.7 million children worldwide missed their 1st measles vaccine dose through routine immunization services in 2021, and another 14.7 million missed their 2nd dose.

Because measles transmits so efficiently, 89% to 94% vaccination coverage is needed to achieve herd immunity depending on the setting, according to a 2017 WHO position paper. The new report estimated that global measles vaccination coverage for the 1st dose in the 2-dose series decreased from a peak of 86% in 2019 to 81% in 2021, the lowest coverage since 2008.

Estimated measles cases and deaths are still down from historic levels, the report noted. From 2000 to 2021, estimated cases decreased from more than 34 million to around 9.5 million and estimated deaths fell from more than 760 000 to almost 128 000 -- an 83% reduction in mortality. However, both estimated cases and deaths were higher in 2021 than in 2020.

In the year leading up to this October [2022], 29 large or disruptive measles outbreaks have occurred in Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Europe, according to provisional monthly data reported to the WHO. Nigeria leads the number of cases reported over the past 12 months, with more than 22 000, but Liberia's measles rate is the highest, at more than 1000 cases per million people.

History tells that outbreaks continue to pose risks to unvaccinated or undervaccinated children everywhere, including in the US, where measles was declared eliminated in 2000. In 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, 873 022 cases were reported during a worldwide measles resurgence, with almost 1300 of those in 31 US states.

In an interview with JAMA, WHO surveillance officer Anna Minta, MD, MPH, the 1st author of the new report, said that the WHO and the CDC "are deeply concerned about the declining coverage rates of measles-containing vaccine."

"With record lows of nearly 25 million children who did not receive even one dose of measles vaccine, suboptimal early detection of measles outbreaks through surveillance, and large ongoing outbreaks," she said, "measles is an imminent threat in every region of the world."

Eroding Progress
----------------
The world has made major strides in routine childhood vaccination in the past 4 decades. Global coverage of the 1st dose of measles-containing vaccine more than doubled from 1980 to 2019, according to an analysis from last year [2021]. But most of the gains were made in the 1st 30 years, and coverage of childhood vaccinations largely plateaued over the past decade.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, routine childhood vaccinations backslid. Data published this fall [2022] suggest that between 2019 and 2021, global vaccination coverage decreased not just for measles but also for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis; tuberculosis; Haemophilus influenzae type b; hepatitis B; polio; rubella; and human papillomavirus.

"The paradox of the pandemic is that while vaccines against COVID-19 were developed in record time and deployed in the largest vaccination campaign in history, routine immunization programmes were badly disrupted, and millions of kids missed out on life-saving vaccinations against deadly diseases like measles," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said in a 23 Nov 2022 statement.

Several factors contributed to the decline in measles vaccination during the pandemic, said Saad B. Omer, MBBS, MPH, PhD, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health. Even early on, the interpretation that parents were afraid to bring their children to vaccination clinics was simplistic, "and has proved to be even more simplistic as time went on," he said in an interview.

More important, in his view, was a whole health system under stress. "There isn't a lot of slack in the world when it comes to the capacity of the system," he said.

Health systems and aid agencies around the world were forced to cut back on non-COVID services to reduce the spread of infection and to divert personnel and other resources to the pandemic. In many places, this affected routine and supplementary immunization activities and disease surveillance, explained Adam Ratner, MD, MPH, director of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at New York University Grossman School of Medicine.

In fact, the new report found that 18 measles vaccination campaigns planned since March 2020 still hadn't taken place by December 2021, adding up to an estimated 61 million vaccine doses that were postponed or missed.

Uptake Issues
-------------
In the US, most children today have access to vaccines, Ratner said in an interview. Vaccine hesitancy, however, is a major barrier to childhood vaccination that is growing in importance, he said.

Ratner noted that before COVID-19, most US neighborhoods had good childhood vaccination coverage, but pockets existed with low rates. During the pandemic, vaccination turned "into this insanely polarized political thing," he said, further eroding vaccine acceptance. "Once there was that kind of hesitancy out there and that kind of divisiveness, it's not surprising that it has bled over into people thinking about vaccine mandates and childhood vaccines in general."

Vaccine hesitancy -- or outright refusal -- is driving the measles outbreak among children in central Ohio, according to Mysheika W. Roberts, MD, MPH, health commissioner for Columbus Public Health, the jurisdiction where about 95% of the total cases have occurred. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic threw fuel on antivaccination sentiment, pockets of her community refused the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, she said in an interview. She attributed this refusal to a persistent misconception that the vaccine causes autism.

In the current outbreak in Ohio, at least 67 of the 73 patients were unvaccinated for measles, according to publicly available data. Seventeen of the children were too young to receive the MMR vaccine, but Roberts' office confirmed that the other 56 were old enough for at least a 1st dose.

"I think these are individuals who are making a decision not to protect their children against vaccine-preventable diseases, and some of them are making a specific decision not to use the MMR vaccine," Roberts said.

She added that the 25 children who have been hospitalized in the outbreak have experienced symptoms including dehydration, diarrhea, and pneumonia, and some have spent at least 1 night in the intensive care unit.

"We're sounding the alarm that if your child is of age and not vaccinated, they should get vaccinated ASAP," she said. Still, she hasn't seen an uptick in parents coming in to get their kids vaccinated, which concerns her.

When asked if her community is undervaccinated, Roberts replied, "That's a great question." Her jurisdiction's measles vaccination rate is estimated at 80% to 90%, but accurate data aren't available because reporting to Ohio's vaccine registry isn't mandatory, she explained.

Omer warned that increasing data gaps will complicate catch-up vaccination strategies, something he's pushing the US and other nations to implement. "We are potentially looking at the biggest backslide in immunization rates, even in this country, and a lot of us are flying blind," he said.

Along with vaccination coverage, the new report found that global measles surveillance also has decreased. Ratner said this means that a recent decline in cases reported worldwide -- from 873 022 in 2019 to 159 073 in 2020 to 123 981 in 2021, according to the 25 Nov 2022 MMWR -- may not be accurate.

An undercount would have implications beyond tracking and preventing measles. For epidemiologists like Minta, measles is a canary in the coal mine. Because measles transmits much more easily from person to person than many other infections but is highly preventable with vaccination, an increase in cases can be the 1st sign of weakness in immunization programs and health systems. "If measles vaccination is decreasing and we're seeing measles outbreaks, that means there's a breakdown in health services in general," Minta said.

Future reports could bring better news. In a 6 Dec 2022 statement, Kate O'Brien, director of the Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals at the WHO, announced that the organization and its immunization partners will intensify action in 2023 to "catch up, recover, and strengthen" the childhood vaccination program to at least prepandemic levels.

Both Ratner and Omer said they expect to see more measles outbreaks in the US and globally until vaccine coverage improves everywhere. This will require strengthening weakened health systems, using data-driven approaches to improve vaccine acceptance, and getting the highest level of political commitment, Omer said: "It's not going to happen on autopilot."

[In each of these countries with increasing cases, the underlying cause is vaccination below the level necessary to protect the unvaccinated population. This is a result of vaccine availability in some countries and vaccine hesitancy in others. In both cases, the health system is not functioning as it needs to, to bring childhood vaccinations up to the level where they need to be. The discussion on this problem in the JAMA paper in [5] is good, but the solution to changing people's attitude towards childhood vaccinations still must be found in the case of hesitancy. - Mod.LK
