SARS: one suspected case reported in China
------------------------------------------
The Chinese Ministry of Health has today [Thu 22 Apr 2004] informed WHO of
one suspected case of SARS. Investigation of the case, including extensive
laboratory testing and tracing and observation of contacts, is under way.
The case is a 20 year old nurse who developed SARS-like symptoms in Beijing
on 5 Apr 2004 and was admitted to hospital on 7 Apr 2004. As her condition
did not improve, she was transferred on 14 Apr 2004 to a second Beijing
hospital, where she was placed in intensive care. Results of initial blood
tests, received today, indicate a likely infection with the SARS
coronavirus, but further testing is needed before a diagnosis of SARS can
be confirmed.
Contact tracing has identified 171 contacts, who have been placed under
observation. Of these, 5 have developed fever. If confirmed, this will be
the first case of SARS since January this year, when authorities in
Guangdong Province confirmed infection in a 35 year old businessman and a
20 year old waitress. Following the end of the SARS outbreak, announced by
WHO on 5 Ju 2003, 5 SARS cases have been confirmed. Two occurred in
laboratory workers, in Singapore and Taiwan, China, and 3 in Guangdong
Province. The third Guangdong case, in a 32 year old television journalist,
was announced in December 2003. None of these 5 cases resulted in further
transmission of the virus.
China, which experienced the largest number of SARS cases during the 2003
outbreak, has a well-developed system for the detection and investigation
of possible cases of SARS. Staff at the WHO office in Beijing have
considerable experience with SARS and are being kept closely informed by
the Ministry of Health.

Beijing reports one SARS suspect case
-------------------------------------
BEIJING: China's Ministry of Health (MOH) spokesman said here on Thu 22 Apr
2004 that one suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) case was
reported in Beijing. The patient, now hospitalized in isolation in
Beijing's Ditan Hospital, has received 2 examinations by a medical expert
team of the Ministry of Health (MOH). The patient, a 20 year old female,
was a nurse in Beijing's Jiangong Hospital, the spokesman said.
Beijing has geared up the early warning system for SARS, organized an
epidemiological investigation and disinfected the living and working places
of the patient. Some 171 people who had close contact with the patient have
received medical observation and 5 who developed fever have been isolated
for further observation.
The MOH has reported the case to the World Health Organisation,and informed
Hong Kong and Macao health authorities about the matter. The patient
reported symptoms of fever, cough and shivering on 5 Apr 2004 and was
hospitalized in Jiangong Hospital on 7 Apr 2004. She was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit of the Renmin Hospital attached to the Beijing
University on 14 Apr 2004. On 19 Apr 2004, 2 relatives who accompanied the
patient in hospital reported fever so the hospital immediately geared up
the early warning system for SARS. A medical examination at the hospital
showed that the patient was IgG positive on Wed 21 Apr 2004. In the morning
of Thu 22 Apr 2004, an examination by the Beijing Center for Disease
Prevention and Control (CDC) showed the patient was IgG and IgM positive,
both strong evidence of a suspect SARS case. In accordance with the program
on SARS prevention for medical systems nationwide, the Beijing Health
Bureau then reported the case to MOH on 22 Apr 2004.
China's national CDC tested the patient and also obtained the result of IgG
and IgM positive. The MOH expert team then determined the patient a suspect
SARS case. The MOH has instructed health departments nationwide to enhance
surveillance and carry out supervision on influenza and pneumonia for early
discovery, reporting, isolation and treatment of SARS.

Second suspected case of SARS reported in Anhui
-----------------------------------------------
BEIJING: The Chinese Ministry of Health on Thu 22 Apr 2004 reported a
second suspected case of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. The
Ministry said 2 people are suspected of having contracted SARS -- one in
Beijing and one in the eastern province of Anhui -- the first cases in
those areas since the country's initial outbreak of the highly contagious
disease subsided last summer.
The patient in Beijing, a 20 year old nurse, has been quarantined in a
hospital and examined by experts from the Ministry of Health, the
government's Xinhua News Agency said. She reported suffering fever, cough
and trembling on 5 Apr 2004 and was hospitalized two days later, but was
only confirmed as a suspected SARS case on Thu 22 Apr 2004, it said. Five
other people who had contact with her have also reported fevers and were
isolated in a hospital, Xinhua said. Doctors are keeping an eye on 171
other people who also had contact with her, to make sure they don't have
symptoms, it said.
Another suspected SARS case was reported in Anhui, said the Governnment in
the Chinese territory of Hong Kong. Hong Kong's authorities said the Health
Ministry notified them of two cases - one in Beijing and one in Anhui - and
it was unclear why the Xinhua report only mentioned the Beijing case.
