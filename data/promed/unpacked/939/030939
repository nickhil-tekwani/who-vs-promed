The number of monkeypox cases, confirmed and suspected, reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), was nearly a 1000-case increase compared to 2019.

In 2019, DRC reported 5288 suspected monkeypox cases, a high number, indeed; however, this number was eclipsed in 2020, during which a total of 6257 suspected and confirmed cases were reported. In addition, the number of deaths from 2019 to 2020 more than doubled: 107 and 229 deaths, respectively.

Monkeypox is a rare disease that occurs throughout remote parts of Central and West Africa, often near tropical rain forests. People at risk for monkeypox are those who get bitten by an infected animal or have contact with the animal's rash, blood, or body fluids. It can also be transmitted person to person through respiratory or direct contact and contact with contaminated bedding or clothing.

Fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, and exhaustion are followed by a rash. Patients are usually ill for 2-4 weeks. Monkeypox is fatal in as many as 10% of people who get it. There is no specific treatment for monkeypox.

[The reason for the increase in the number of monkeypox (MPX) cases in the DR Congo last year (2020) is not given. As noted previously, MPX virus is endemic in the DRC and widespread there geographically. One wonders if many of the reported suspected cases that have not been laboratory confirmed may be chickenpox, caused by varicella-zoster virus. There is no specific information about the circumstances under which these cases acquired their infection. But as the report above mentions, contact with infected carrier rodents may be the source of MPX virus transmission.

Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp, an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus can be transmitted between people but not readily. - Mod.TY
