With intensified efforts this year, Singapore's fight against dengue
appears to have paid off, with 25 percent fewer cases than last year
[2007]. A spokesman for the National Environment Agency added that
the early and intensive exercise against the _Aedes_ mosquito this
year [2008] has staved off an anticipated dengue epidemic. Dengue
epidemics tend to come in 5-6 year cycles.

So far this year [2008], 6424 people have become sick with dengue and
dengue haemorrhagic fever, 2183 fewer than last year. "Earlier this
year, it was predicted that Singapore would experience major dengue
outbreaks and the situation would be worse than last year," she said.

But instead of going up, the number of infections had gone down
significantly, due to the [Singapore dollar] 200 000 [USD 137 000] a
day spent fighting the scourge this year [2008].

"This reversal in dengue trend, the 1st time in 3 decades, is a
result of the enhanced dengue control strategy put in place by NEA,"
said the spokesman.

The best way to stop the spread of the disease is to prevent
mosquitoes from breeding. This year [2008], the National Environment
Agency has a team of 500 people doing just that. A mosquito needs
just a small spoonful of stagnant water to breed. The _A. aegypti_
breeds well in indoor receptacles.

[Singapore is also experiencing a simultaneous outbreak of chikungunya
virus infection (see ProMED archive no. 20081226.4074). It will be
interesting to receive updates on these outbreaks, and the progress on
vector mosquito control there.

North Queensland is heading for its worst dengue fever outbreak in 5
years, with 52 cases already confirmed. 6 people have been admitted
to hospital, while 7 others are awaiting test results.

Queensland Health senior medical entomologist, Brian Montgomery, said
the dengue fever season in Cairns had started 2 months earlier than
usual. This suggested it would be a bad one for the mosquito-borne
[virus].

"The escalation in numbers is the quickest it's been since 2003-04,"
he said. In that year, 2 people died of the most serious form of the
disease, dengue haemorrhagic fever [DHF], the 1st such deaths in more
than a century in Queensland. Mr. Montgomery said the dengue
mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_, was an "urban mosquito" which usually bred
in containers around people's homes and tended to be daytime biters.

"One infected mosquito has a very high strike rate of being able to
infect humans," he said. "They tend not to fly more than 100m or 200m
[110 or 120 yards], so by paying attention to what happens in your
yard, you can exert some level of control over your exposure. "The
messages are all about emptying pot-plant bases and old tyres and
tarps that hold water, flushing out bird baths and unblocking roof gutters."

To avoid being bitten, people are advised to wear insect repellent
and use indoor surface spray, mozzie [mosquito] zappers and coils
around the house. More than 800 people were infected in Cairns,
Townsville and the Torres Strait during the 2003-04 season.

Symptoms of dengue fever, which can result from infection with any of
4 [virus serotypes], can include a fever, headaches, especially behind
the eyes, a rash, unpleasant taste sensation, extreme tiredness,
muscle aches and pains, and diarrhoea.

Queensland Health public health specialist Jeffrey Hanna said people
with symptoms should seek medical attention. "Infection can
make people feel very ill," he said. But, Dr. Hanna said, the trigger
for the potentially life-threatening complications associated with
dengue haemorrhagic fever was a 2nd or 3rd attack with a different
[serotype] of the virus.

[While secondary infection with a different dengue virus serotype may
cause DHF, some dengue virus subtypes may cause more severe disease
than others as well. It would be of interest to know which of the 4
dengue viruses are circulating in the area, and any genetic analysis
of the current viruses that may be available.
