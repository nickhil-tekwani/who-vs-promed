Of the 500 blood samples collected from the suspected chikungunya
cases in Dakshina Kannada district, as many as 78 have been tested
positive, according to District Health Officer (DHO) Dr. Jagannath.
Speaking to Deccan Herald, he said: "We have sent another batch of
blood samples to the National Virology department at Bangalore and
waiting for the results."

Spiking the media reports on deaths due to chikungunya in Sullia and
Puttur taluks, he said: "I have collected the medical reports of the
12 persons who died recently in Sullia and Puttur taluks. We have
even conducted post mortem on one person. The report stated that they
died of other ailments like renal failure, acute respiratory problems
and so on." [A taluk is an administrative division in some Indian
states, and consists of a headquarters city with authority over
villages and municipalities within its jurisdiction. - Mod.TY]

"In spite of repeatedly saying that chikungunya is not fatal, the
media reports continue to say that people died of chikungunya," he
regretted. [There is some epidemiological evidence of rare deaths due
to chikungunya virus infection during the 2005-2007 Indian Ocean
outbreak - Mod.TY]

It may be recalled that the 1st chikungunya suspected cases were
reported from Sullia. Later, it began to spread to Puttur,
Belthangady, Bantwal, Mangalore and Moodabidri taluks. Though the
number of outpatients have declined in Sullia taluk, the suspected
chikungunya cases are on rise in Bantwal and Mangalore taluk.

In Mangalore taluk alone, there are nearly 19 000 cases, the DHO stated.

According to unconfirmed reports, the suspected chikungunya cases
have crossed 50 000 in the entire district besides the neighbouring
Kasargod district in Kerala. The district administration with the
help of 5 medical colleges has initiated measures to check the spread
of chikungunya. Fogging and spraying has been undertaken in the
affected areas.

[ProMED thanks Dr. John for this report. The extent of this outbreak
and the large number of cases is remarkable. Unfortunately, spraying
and fogging are not likely to provide long-term control of the
_Aedes_ chikungunya virus vector mosquitoes. Only elimination of
breeding sites in and immediately around houses and other buildings
will accomplish control.
