Absence of Hantaan virus from the Balkans
-----------------------------------------
The ProMED-mail post of Mon 13 May 2002 [archived as Hantavirus infection -
Slovenia (02) 20020513.4194] contained the statement that: "Hantaan virus,
Dobrava-Belgrade virus, and Puumala virus coexist in this area.
Dobrova-Belgrade virus was first isolated in 1988 from a yellow-necked
field mouse (_Apodemus flavicollis_) in Dobrova, Slovenia."
This is not the first time that old myths have emerged, but in fact,
Hantaan virus has never been found in Europe. Old reports on Hantaan virus
appeared (mainly) in 1980's before Dobrava-Belgrade virus was found and
only Hantaan virus-based serotests were used. These 2 murine hantaviruses
cross-react. Hantaan virus has never been found in rodents in Europe.
Instead, [in Europe] we have the related Saaremaa virus in the same host,
_Apodemus agrarius_, that in the eastern part of its discontinuous
distribution range in the Far East carries the real Hantaan virus. However,
the pathogenicity of these 2 hantaviruses seems to be different, the
European Saaremaa virus being less virulent.

Comment on the identity of the hantaviruses present in Slovenia
----------------------------------------------------
Until molecular methods and plaque reduction neutralization tests were
widely used for confirmation [of virus identity], it was thought that
Hantaan virus was also present in Slovenia. This is due to the fact that
Hantaan virus, Dobrava-Belgrade virus, and Seoul virus are highly
cross-reactive in immunofluorescence and EIA tests.
Since 1995 we have been very confident that Puumala virus and
Dobrava-Belgrade virus are the only causative agents of HFRS [hemorrhagic
fever with renal syndrome] in Slovenia and [throughout] the Balkans.

[ProMED-mail appreciates these clarifying statements from Drs. Henttonen
and Avsic-Zupanc (and a similar opinion from Mod. Emeritus CHC) concerning
the possible presence of Hantaan virus in the Balkans. Hantaan virus
achieved prominence as the cause of Korean hemorrhagic fever (possibly the
severest form of HFRS) among United Nations troops in Korea in the 1950's.
It is named after the Hantaan river near the demilitarized zone dividing
the Korean peninsula where the infected rodent host was first captured.
