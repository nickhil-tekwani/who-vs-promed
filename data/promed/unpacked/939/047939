Revised regulations on bulk tank milk Q fever monitoring
--------------------------------------------------------
Minister Gerda Verburg of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV),
has revised the temporary animal disease regulations concerning Q
fever. The Animal Health Service (GD) examines bulk tank milk samples
for the presence of _Coxiella burnetii_ (Q fever). In most sheep and
goat farms, these samples are collected by the GD. Some farmers,
however, send their samples to the GD independently. Following the
modification in the regulations, the DG will collect samples from
these farms directly, similarly to all other farms. By this
arrangement, the quality of the samples and the reliability of the
research results will improve. This regulation addresses about 50 out
of the 411 sheep and goat farms. The changes take effect on 30 Dec
2009, at 4.00 pm.

Compulsory periodic bulk tank milk monitoring has been introduced in
the Netherlands as of 1 Oct 2009. Its purpose is to detect, by
frequent testing, newly infected farms. The monitoring frequency is,
as of 14 Dec 2009, increased to once every 2 weeks. [The initial
required sampling frequency was once in 2 months; the revision is
explained by the fact that excretion of the bacterium may be
intermittent. - Mod.AS]

[The given number of monitored farms, 411, most probably does not
include the 61 farms already declared infected, in which all pregnant
animals are to be culled (a measure already under application). The
monitoring system addresses farms with more than 50 lactating
animals. These make only part of the Dutch goat and sheep industries,
with a total of 350 000 goats and at least 1.2 million sheep (2008
figures; reportedly, there are also several hundred-thousand sheep
kept in non-commercial holdings as "hobby animals"). While most goats
are milk producers, most sheep are kept for mutton production. The
current monitoring addresses only dairy sheep, the number of which
being rather low (how many farms?). However, sheep are regarded, in
many countries, as the major Q fever reservoir, excreting the
pathogen mainly during the lambing season. Data on serosurveillance
in Dutch sheep, and the number of dairy goat farms with less than 50
animals, will be of epidemiological interest.

More than 75 years following its initial discovery (in Hamilton,
Montana, USA and in Melbourne, Queensland, Australia) there are still
many "queries" regarding Q or query fever. These relate, mainly, to
the epidemiology of the disease in animals and man and to the
characteristics of the microorganism. Investigations by the Dutch
researchers have already provided some interesting results, such as
the initial findings that the bacterium can be detected in air
samples, shortly after the outbreak, at distances of 500 and 1000 m
(0.3-0.6 mi] around the infected dairy goat farm. However, the
duration of detectability of the bacteria in the air is not yet known.

The current outbreak of unprecedented magnitude in a highly
industrialised, densely populated country with a (still) strong
agrarian sector may provide a unique opportunity for research in
order to obtain answers to some of the pending queries. The effort,
which seems to be invested by the researchers, eventually backed by
the government, is promising. - Mod.AS]
