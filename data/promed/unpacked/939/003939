Abstract
--------
Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged since 2013 as a significant global human health threat following outbreaks in the Pacific Islands and rapid spread throughout South and Central America. Severe congenital and neurological sequelae have been linked to ZIKV infections. Assessing the ability of common mosquito species to transmit ZIKV and characterizing variation in mosquito transmission of different ZIKV strains is important for estimating regional outbreak potential and for prioritizing local mosquito control strategies for _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. In this study, we evaluated the laboratory vector competence of _A. aegypti_, _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and _Cx. tarsalis_ that originated in areas of California where ZIKV cases in travelers since 2015 were frequent. We compared infection, dissemination, and transmission rates by measuring ZIKV RNA levels in cohorts of mosquitoes that ingested blood meals from type I interferon-deficient mice infected with either a Puerto Rican ZIKV strain from 2015 (PR15), a Brazilian ZIKV strain from 2015 (BR15), or an ancestral Asian-lineage Malaysian ZIKV strain from 1966 (MA66). With PR15, _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ was refractory to infection (0 percent , N = 42) and _Cx. tarsalis_ was infected at 4 percent (N = 46). No ZIKV RNA was detected in saliva from either _Culex_ species 14 or 21 days post feeding (dpf). In contrast, _A. aegypti_ developed infection rates of 85 percent (PR15; N = 46), 90 percent (BR15; N = 20), and 81 percent (MA66; N = 85) 14 or 15 dpf. Although MA66-infected _A. aegypti_ showed higher levels of ZIKV RNA in mosquito bodies and legs, transmission rates were not significantly different across virus strains (P = 0.13, Fisher's exact test). To confirm infectivity and measure the transmitted ZIKV dose, we enumerated infectious ZIKV in _A. aegypti_ saliva using Vero cell plaque assays. The expectorated plaque forming units (PFU) varied by viral strain: MA66-infected expectorated 13+/-4 PFU (mean+/-SE, N = 13) compared to 29+/-6 PFU for PR15-infected (N = 13) and 35+/-8 PFU for BR15-infected (N = 6; ANOVA, df = 2, F = 3.8, P = 0.035). These laboratory vector competence results support an emerging consensus that _Cx. tarsalis_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ are not vectors of ZIKV. These results also indicate that _A. aegypti_ from California are efficient laboratory vectors of ancestral and contemporary Asian lineage ZIKV.

Author summary
--------------
Assessing the ability of common mosquito species to transmit Zika virus (ZIKV) and characterizing variation in mosquito transmission of different ZIKV strains is important for estimating regional outbreak potential and for prioritizing local mosquito control strategies for _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. In this study, we evaluated the laboratory vector competence of _A. aegypti_, _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and _Cx. tarsalis_ that originated in areas of California where ZIKV cases in travelers since 2015 were frequent.

We observed variation in infection loads between ZIKV strains in _A. aegypti_, but transmission rates were not different. In addition, there was a positive relationship between ZIKV RNA levels in infected mosquitoes ascertained from bodies and ZIKV RNA transmission rates. Our data add to the growing body of evidence supporting the role of _Aedes aegypti_ as a ZIKV vector and refute _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ and _Cx. tarsalis_ as vectors.

Discussion
----------
This laboratory vector competence study confirmed that _A. aegypti_ from Los Angeles, California, USA, can transmit Asian lineage ZIKV and that _Cx. tarsalis_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ are inefficient ZIKV vectors. Given that _Culex_ mosquitoes are poor ZIKV vectors and seek primarily non-human hosts, they are unlikely to facilitate a ZIKV outbreak. Thus, vector control efforts targeting ZIKV should remain focused on reducing urban _Aedes_ populations.

[_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes have been found in various localities in southern California (see ProMED-mail archive Invasive mosquito - USA (15): (CA) 20171004.5360083), raising questions about their competence as vectors of Zika virus, given that individuals viruemic with this virus infected elsewhere do return to California. The report above clearly indicates that they are efficient vectors of the virus. There are also questions about the vector competence of the more abundant native mosquito, _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Conflicting reports of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ susceptibility and ability, or lack of it, to transmit Zika virus, make it difficult to assess the importance of this mosquito as a vector of the virus in nature.

The report above indicates that _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ is refractory for infection by 3 strains of Zika virus. A recently published report stated that a laboratory colony of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ mosquitoes were experimentally infected and able to salivate Zika virus at 16 days post infection. ZIKV RNA was detected in bodies and in saliva deposited on filter paper cards with subsequent studies demonstrating the presence of live ZIKV in saliva. Huang Yan-Jang S et al. reported that Vero Beach, Florida _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ were refractory to Zika virus infection (Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases. 2016, 16(10): 673-6; https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/vbz.2016.2058) as was this mosquito tested by Amraoui et al (Euro Surveill. 2016; 21(35): pii=30333>; https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2016.21.35.30333).

Until Zika virus is recovered from _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ during a Zika virus outbreak and the local strain of the virus is shown to replicate in that mosquito and be transmitted by bite, the vector status of that mosquito will remain undetermined. - Mod.TY
