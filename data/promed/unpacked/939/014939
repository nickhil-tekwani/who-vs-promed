A few months ago, Marion County [Indianapolis, Indiana] health
officials noticed a disturbing trend: More cases of syphilis had
occurred in the first 3 months of the year than in all of 2007. The
sudden uptick raised a specter of fear. Could Indianapolis be
experiencing another outbreak akin to the one in 1999 that earned the
city the unwanted distinction of being number 1 in the nation in
syphilis cases?

In just 4 years, Health Department officials had transformed that
statistic. By 2003, incidences of syphilis in Indianapolis were lower
than in all other large U.S. cities, and they remained so through
2005. But as of the middle of August [2008], Indianapolis had 89
cases of syphilis, more than in any year since 2001. Marion County
Health Department officials, however, say that in recent weeks
they've seen what they hope proves to be a tapering off of cases. "For
right now, we're looking like we're able to contain the infection,"
said Dr. Virginia Caine, director of the agency. "We're cautiously
optimistic."

That success, they say, comes largely thanks to lessons learned
during the 1999 outbreak and an ensuing one the next year. "That gave
us a leg up, not to need a learning curve to figure out what to do,"
said Dan Brooks, a county Health Department disease intervention
specialist who worked through both outbreaks. In many respects, the
outbreaks bear few similarities. In 1999 and 2000, the bulk of the
cases occurred in 3 ZIP codes and were split between men and women.
About 95 percent of the patients were black, and many of them were
prostitutes or women trading sex for drugs. This year [2008], the
bulk of the cases have occurred in white men, most of whom have sex
with other men. More than half were HIV-positive.

Combating a sexually-transmitted disease such as syphilis is no easy
task. Called the "great imitator" because it resembles many other
conditions, syphilis can have symptoms that are insidiously mild. The
earliest symptom is a lesion so insignificant that some men mistake
it for a zipper cut. Women who suffer internal lesions may not even
realize it. Then, 3 weeks later, a person develops a nonitchy rash on
the palms of the hands or soles of the feet that may not prompt a
doctor's visit. It's in this often undetected early stage that
syphilis can be most infectious. It is also in this stage that it's
easiest to cure, usually requiring a single dose of penicillin. So
public health officials aim to reach people with the disease before
they realize they have it. "We're trying to break the cycle of
infection," Brooks said.

That's where the lessons of the past play a major role. 9 years ago,
when the syphilis outbreak hit, the Health Department had only 4
disease intervention specialists on staff. Others were borrowed from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This time around, the
Health Department has 8 disease intervention specialists on staff. In
2000, the department mobilized the community. Much of the money to
fight the outbreak was allocated to about 80 community organizations
to do outreach, spreading the message door to door, into barber
shops, hair salons and bars. "For us, that was a difficult decision
because our comfort level is better when we're doing the campaign.
But the community said, 'No,' " Caine said.

This year, disease intervention specialists plotted a strategy by
extensively interviewing patients about their lifestyle, asking them
how and where they met their sexual partners. Bars, bathhouses and
online, patient after patient said. So the intervention specialists
took their message to those places. They set up shop a few nights a
week in the city's most popular gay bars and bathhouses, with the
blessing of the establishments' owners. Some bars even agreed to
waive admission fees for patrons who agreed to be tested. The
specialists also visited health fairs with a mobile unit to screen
those at risk. And they contacted people's partners through the
Internet, sending e-mails and instant messages identifying themselves
and saying they were contacting them about a health concern. "We let
them see the Health Department is here to be a friend and not to get
into their business," Brooks said.

The efforts are paying off. Thanks to those strategies, more than 250
people have been screened for the disease. But some think even more
should be done. Al Polin, former chairman of the Stamp Out Syphilis
Coalition created during the last outbreak, said he'd like to see
billboards throughout the city as there were 9 years ago. "You don't
see much advertising like it was when we were doing it," he said. Of
particular concern is the fact that syphilis puts an HIV-negative
person at greater risk of contracting that disease because it results
in an open sore through which the virus can enter, Caine said.

Instead of screening HIV-positive patients for syphilis once a year,
as previously recommended, the Health Department has asked doctors to
screen them every 3 months, said Dr. Janet Arno, medical director of
the Bell Flower Clinic for the Marion County Sexually Transmitted
Diseases program. It's also exploring on-the-spot tests that could
give results in the field within 20 minutes, she said. Treating just
one more person could make a difference, Caine said: "You can have
one person who has syphilis and is a busy bee out there."

[The rise in incidence of syphilis in Indianapolis is part of a
national trend. See "US syphilis rate up for 7th year in row, CDC
says", available at:
<http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN12209548>.

The following is extracted from a prior ProMED post: Syphilis - USA
(NY) 20070814.2650, which reported on a recent upsurge in syphilis
cases in Manhattan, NY, that also centered among gay men:

"The total number of cases of syphilis (primary, secondary, and
tertiary) reported annually in the United States declined
dramatically in the 1940's to a low in 2000. As the rate of primary
and secondary (infectious) syphilis (a better indicator of disease
activity) decreased among homosexual and bisexual males, largely
because of changes in sexual behavior due to AIDS, a spike occurred
in the late 1980s among heterosexual men, women, and neonates
(congenital syphilis) that was attributed to epidemic of crack
cocaine use and exchange of sex for drugs.

"Cases of syphilis again dropped from 1990 to 2000. In 2000, the rate
of primary and secondary syphilis in the United States was 2.1 cases
per 100 000 population, the lowest since reporting began in 1941.
From 2001 to 2004, the primary and secondary syphilis rate increased
nationally to 2.7, primarily as a result of increases in cases among
men who have sex with men
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm>).

"Multiple factors likely account for the recent resurgence in
syphilis, including 'HIV prevention fatigue,' which appears to limit
effective condom use, and use of 'club' drugs, such as
methamphetamine, gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), Ecstasy, and ketamine,
that can also lead to unsafe sex with multiple partners
(<http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/Clubdrugs.html>.) Use of the
Internet for sexual partnering may also be a contributing factor. The
problem is not isolated to the USA; in Canada, syphilis is now
reported to be 9 times the rate it was in 1997
(<http://www.thestar.com/article/245612>).

"In Manhattan, NY, in 2007 there was also an increase in cases among
women, who may be having sex with bisexual men. Infectious syphilis
can increase their chance of HIV transmission 3 to 5 fold and
infectious syphilis in women can be followed by an increase in
neonatal syphilis."
