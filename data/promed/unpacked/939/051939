[ASF was reported in March 2017 from Russia's Irkutsk oblast (map at https://goo.gl/maps/7rpt4iyZbFv) facing Mongolia's northern border (20170328.4929925). In September 2018, following the report of the 1st outbreak in [China's] Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the genotyping of China's ASF virus as closely related to the Russian strain, ProMED-mail commented: "It would be interesting to get information on surveillance activities undertaken in Mongolia with respect to ASF" (20180926.6053378).

According to media reports (see article at http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-01/14/c_137743528.htm) on 14 Jan 2019, ASF was detected in 4 provinces in Mongolia. The affected provinces are Bulgan and Orkhon in the north, Tuv in the central part, and Dundgovi in the south. The report indicated that thousands of pigs have died.

However, to date, only one immediate notification report has been sent to the OIE with information about the ASF outbreak in the province of Bulgan. The total susceptible population in Bulgan was not provided. Given the rapid spread of the virus and the current situation in Russia and China, the discrepancy in information between what is being reported by the media and what has been reported officially to the OIE needs to be clarified. - Mods.CRD/AS
