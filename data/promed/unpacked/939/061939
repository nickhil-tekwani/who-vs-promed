Since the 1st case reported in March 2013, human infection with H7N9 avian influenza has been with us for 3 seasons. On [9 Nov 2015], the Zhejiang Center for Disease Control said that since entering autumn of 2015, there have been a total of 4 cases of H7N9. The fact that cases are continuously appearing shows that Zhejiang has already entered a new season for human infection with H7N9 avian influenza and, as the weather cools, the risk of human infection by the H7N9 pathogen increases daily.

[Excerpted from WHO (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_15October_2015.pdf):

During 2015, there have been continued avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detections in the animal population in multiple provinces in China, indicating that the virus persists in the poultry population. If the pattern of human cases follows the trends seen in previous years, the number of human cases may rise over the coming months. Further sporadic cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are, therefore, expected in affected and possibly neighboring areas. A total of 679 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses, including at least 275 deaths, have been reported to WHO. A figure of the number of confirmed cases by week from 2013-2015 can be accessed at the URL above.

Posted translation from the Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China on how to prevent infection with H7N9, 5 Nov 2015 http://www.moa.gov.cn/govpublic/SYJ/201511/t20151109_4894358.htm:

Firstly, strengthen monitoring and early warning. All localities should follow the national animal disease surveillance program requirements, combined with the national influenza H7N9 in poultry culling program; do a good job of monitoring and epidemiological investigation, timely detection, removing poultry farming, and other key aspects.

Regional human infections appear to strengthen the monitoring of investigations, patient locations, and the surrounding areas of live bird markets and poultry farms. The National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory will continue to track virus variations, biological characteristics of the virus, and other research, and strengthen prevention and control technical support.

Secondly, strengthen epidemic prevention management and live bird market regulation of transporting live poultry. Animal husbandry and veterinary departments should actively cooperate with relevant departments to strengthen management of live poultry markets and epidemic prevention and the implementation of a regular disinfection system. Animal health oversight agencies should strengthen inter-provincial supervision of transportation of poultry and quarantines.

Thirdly, strengthening sector collaboration: Animal husbandry and veterinary departments should strengthen cooperation with relevant departments of family planning and other health departments according to their respective division of responsibilities on strict source control and strengthen measures linkage with effective implementation of prevention and control work.

Fourthly, emergency preparedness: All localities should further strengthen emergency prevention and control management, standardize emergency procedures, strengthen emergency team building and emergency supplies reserves, and improve emergency response capabilities. To strengthen emergency duty, strictly implement staff being on duty 24 hours a day. Once animal H7N9 positive samples have been detected, disposal should be strictly in accordance with regulations with a follow-up investigation.

Fifthly, strengthen advocacy and information dissemination: To continue to adhere to the "timely and accurate, open and transparent" principle, regularly publish information on prevention and control, and enhance information dissemination effectiveness.
