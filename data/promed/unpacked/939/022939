[The 17th meeting of the Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TAD)'s Standing Group of Experts on ASF in Europe (SGE ASF17) took place as a teleconference on 4 Jun 2021. A total of 14 countries of Europe participated, as well as the representatives of GF-TAD from Asia and the Americas. In the summary of the meeting report, it is noted:

"The SGE ASF17 developed a set of recommendations. Amongst these, it was highlighted that:

- Based on science and OIE Standards, Recommendations published by the SGE since 2014 should be considered; helping all countries reach the objectives of the GF-TADs ASF initiative. These include new OIE Compartmentalisation Guidelines.
- Exit strategies for ASF in wild boar populations should be based on ASF status determination, implying appropriate surveillance programs.
- Two types of strategies have been used with apparent success, either quasi extinction of the host or progressive decrease in incidence; surveillance is critical to demonstrating the resulting freedom of ASF and can be constructed in 2 steps.
- Passive surveillance is key in evaluating the performance of exit strategies" (https://rr-europe.oie.int/en/events/sge-asf17-17th-meeting-of-the-standing-group-of-experts-on-african-swine-fever-in-europe/).

According to the meeting report, Russia and Ukraine noted the following:

Russia
- Regionalization is currently applied inside the Russian Federation, with different administrative divisions considered.
- Since the beginning of 2021, there were 24 outbreaks detected in wild boar carcasses, especially in the Far East (conservation area for Amur Tigers).
- The other regions with outbreaks were essentially in the central-south regions of the Russian Federation. There, surveillance gave 100% PCR positivity in wild boar found dead, as well as in hunted wild boar.
- The largest outbreak to date was detected in domestic animals in the same period, with 462 000 pigs culled in a commercial farm in Tverskaya oblast.
- The source of the virus in backyard outbreaks is essentially due to swill feeding.
- This year (2021), there were no issues with COVID-19; restrictions were limited, but some owners did not want to let inspectors in for the inventory because they were afraid of getting infected by the virus.

Ukraine
- During the period, one wild boar carcass (found dead) from the hitherto free zone tested positive; no carcasses tested positive within the affected zone (Kiev area).
- In domestic pigs, there were 7 cases in backyards, 4 in commercial farms.
- COVID-19 did not have an impact on the ASF control.

The presentations on the national ASF epidemiological status in Russia and Ukraine (until June 2021) can be seen at https://rr-europe.oie.int/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/c13_sge_asf17_russia.pdf and https://rr-europe.oie.int/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/c16_sge_asf17_ukraine.pdf, respectively.
