Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Oman
---------------------------------------------------------------
On [17 Jan 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of Oman notified WHO of one additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the case are as follows:

A 43-year-old male from Dakhelyia Region. The patient is a direct contact of a laboratory-confirmed, fatal MERS-CoV case and was identified through contact screening. He was admitted to hospital on [16 Jan 2015] and discharged on [19 Jan 2015] but the patient remains asymptomatic. He has no comorbidities. The patient visited the fatal case at home and participated in the funeral rites. He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to a respiratory sample being taken.

Tracing and monitoring of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for this case.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 956 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 351 related deaths.

[This now represents the 5th case of MERS-CoV infection reported by Oman since April 2012, and increases the global tally of MERS-CoV infected individuals maintained and confirmed by WHO to 956, including at least 351 deaths. From the description provided above, this individual was asymptomatic and was identified through contact tracing/testing.

[In the past 24 hours since the last report from the Saudi MOH (see MERS-CoV (13): Saudi Arabia, new cases 20150122.3111739), there were no newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported. The newly reported fatality is most likely the 80-year-old Saudi male from Riyadh who was reported as a newly confirmed case on 22 Jan 2015, at which time he was noted to be in critical condition. He did not have a history of animal exposure or exposure to other MERS-CoV infected individuals in the community. A possible history of contact with a suspected or confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in the healthcare environment was under investigation. The newly reported recovered case is most likely the 61-year-old male from Riyadh reported on 6 Jan 2015, at which time he was in the ICU. At the time of the confirmation report, the individual was said to be a non-Saudi national, but in the report of his recovery he is listed as a Saudi national. He did not have a history of any identified high risk exposures in the 14 days preceding onset of his illness.

On 21 Jan 2015, the ECDC published the 13th update Rapid Risk Assessment for MERS-CoV with data current through 13 Jan 2015. The update does not include the newly reported case in Oman, and is current through a total of 833 cases and 358 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia (as of today, 23 Jan 2015, there have been 842 cases and 364 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia). For those who are interested in the epidemiology of reported cases, I highly recommend reading this report (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/RRA-MERS-CoV-thirteenth-update.pdf). It contains an excellent map showing the locations and numbers of cases by location reported by Saudi Arabia since October 2014. The conclusion of the CDCD report is that the risk to the EU of MERS-CoV is very low. - Mod.MPP]
