Abstract
--------
Background: Jimsonweed (_Datura stramonium_) contains toxic alkaloids causing gastrointestinal and central nervous system symptoms when ingested. This can be lethal at high doses. The plant may grow together with leguminous crops, mixing with them during harvesting. On [13 Mar 2019], more than 200 case-patients were admitted to multiple health centres for acute gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms. We investigated to determine the cause and magnitude of the outbreak and recommended evidence-based control and prevention measures.

Methods: We defined a suspected case as sudden onset of confusion, dizziness, convulsions, hallucinations, diarrhoea, or vomiting with no other medically plausible explanations in a resident of Napak or Amudat District from [1 Mar to 30 Apr 2019]. We reviewed medical records and canvassed all villages of the 8 affected subcounties to identify cases. In a retrospective cohort study conducted in 17 villages reporting the earliest cases, we interviewed 211 residents about dietary history during [11 to 15 Mar 2019]. We used modified Poisson regression to assess suspected food exposures. Food samples underwent chemical (heavy metals, chemical contaminants, and toxins), proteomic, DNA, and microbiological testing in 1 national and 3 international laboratories.

Results: We identified 293 suspected cases; 5 (1.7%) died. Symptoms included confusion (62%), dizziness (38%), diarrhoea (22%), nausea/vomiting (18%), convulsions (12%), and hallucinations (8%). The outbreak started on [12 Mar 2019], 2-12 h after Batch X of fortified corn-soy blend (CSB +) was distributed. In the retrospective cohort study, 66% of 134 persons who ate CSB +, compared with 2.2% of 75 who did not developed illness (RRadj = 22, 95% CI = 6.0-81). Samples of Batch X distributed [11 to 15 Mar 2019] contained 14 tropane alkaloids, including atropine (25-50 ppm) and scopolamine (1-10 ppm). Proteins of Solanaceae seeds and Jimsonweed DNA were identified. No other significant laboratory findings were observed.

Conclusion: This was the largest documented outbreak caused by food contamination with tropane alkaloids. Implicated food was immediately withdrawn. Routine food safety and quality checks could prevent future outbreaks.

[In 2019 when this occurred, we suspected it was a Datura plant based on the clinical signs listed in the articles and knowing the plant was in the area. It is nice to see it definitely confirmed. It is a tragic situation which could have been prevented and we hope in the future these situations will be identified prior to the illness and losses suffered by individuals.

There are a number of Datura species world wild, with most producing the same clinical signs. Readers are encourged to learn more about this plant by reviewing the articles in the "see also" section.

The plants usually have large leaves, showy blooms and the fruit pod is hard and spiked.

A photo of the spiked fruit may be seen at https://www.treeworld.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/datura-plant-scaled.jpg.
