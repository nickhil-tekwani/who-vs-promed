About 100 children from 0-5 years of age have died since January 2015 as a result of the measles epidemic in the territory of Pweto (Katanga), said the head of Moero sector, Shadrach Kazembe, on 7 May 2015. He attributed the rise of the epidemic to the movement of people due to repeated incursions of the Mayi-Mayi in the area, located more than 200 km away from Lubumbashi, the capital of Katanga.

"It's been several years since this disease was not registered in our health area. With the movement caused by [Mayi-Mayi], there was spread of this disease," said Shadrach Kazembe.

Cases of deaths have been recorded in the health areas of Dikulushi and Mubanga Katendeji.

Kazembe said that possible solutions are being considered by the NGO Alima, who has run a vaccination program in the country against measles since 13 May 2015. Acknowledging the epidemic in the region, the chief doctor of Kilwa health zone reported 40 fatal cases.

From 1 Jan to 1 May 2015, 169 people from 20 states and the District of Columbia were reported to have measles [AZ, CA, CO, DC, DE, FL, GA, IL, MA, MI, MN, NE, NJ, NY, NV, OK, PA, SD, TX, UT, WA]. Most of these cases [117 cases (70 percent)] are part of a large, multi-state outbreak linked to an amusement park in California.

15 states (Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah) and the District of Columbia have had 1-4 cases. Three states (Arizona, Nevada and Washington) have 5-9 cases. One state (Illinois) has 10-19 cases, and one state (California) has 20 or more cases. These are provisional data reported to CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. [The original report displays these data in the form of maps].

The United States experienced a record number of measles cases during 2014, with 668 cases from 27 states reported to CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). This is the greatest number of cases since measles elimination was documented in the U.S. in 2000.

169 cases were reported in 20 states and District of Columbia: Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Washington. There were 5 outbreaks representing 89 percent of reported cases this year [2015].

The majority of people who got measles were unvaccinated. Measles is still common in many parts of the world including some countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa.

Travelers with measles continue to bring the disease into the U.S. Measles can spread when it reaches a community in the U.S. where groups of people are unvaccinated.

Outbreaks in countries to which Americans often travel can directly contribute to an increase in measles cases in the U.S.

In 2015: The United States experienced a large, multi-state measles outbreak linked to an amusement park in California. The outbreak likely started from a traveler who became infected overseas with measles, then visited the amusement park while infectious; however, no source was identified. Analysis by CDC scientists showed that the measles virus type in this outbreak (B3) was identical to the virus type that caused the large measles outbreak in the Philippines in 2014.

2014: The U.S. experienced 23 measles outbreaks in 2014, including one large outbreak of 383 cases, occurring primarily among unvaccinated Amish communities in Ohio. Many of the cases in the U.S. in 2014 were associated with cases brought in from the Philippines, see the Measles in the Philippines Travelers' Health Notice.

2013: The U.S. experienced 11 outbreaks in 2013, 3 of which had more than 20 cases, including an outbreak with 58 cases. For more information, see Measles -- United States, 1 Jan-24 Aug 2013.

2011: In 2011, more than 30 countries in the WHO European Region reported an increase in measles, and France was experiencing a large outbreak. Most of the cases that were brought to the U.S. in 2011 came from France. For more information, see Measles -- United States, January-20 May 2011.

2008: The increase in cases in 2008 was the result of spread in communities with groups of unvaccinated people. The U.S. experienced several outbreaks in 2008 including 3 large outbreaks. For more information, see Update: Measles -- United States, January-July 2008.

An outbreak of measles involving 67 cases (median age 15 years) has been reported in the French region of Alsace, in the department of Haut-Rhin bordering Germany and Switzerland. The French index case had most probably been infected during a school trip to Berlin, following contact with a confirmed case in the German host family. Due to the low vaccination coverage among the students in the French anthroposophical school, the virus spread rapidly, leading to secondary cases in siblings and friends of the infected student.

Given that the reported vaccination coverage for the 1st dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) in France is below 90 percent and considering the current school holiday period in the region, it is considered possible that this outbreak could spread to other areas with susceptible populations, including neighbouring Germany and Switzerland.

Control measures implemented by the French health authorities in Alsace include vaccination recommendations and information to health professionals, families and schools. Contact tracing is ongoing in order to offer vaccination within 72 hours of exposure as a prophylactic measure if the vaccination status of contacts is unknown or unvaccinated, and, when needed, to offer a 2nd dose of MCV. In addition, people at high risk, unable to be targeted by the vaccine (such as infants and pregnant women) are offered administration of human normal immunoglobulin within 6 days after contact. Health professionals have also been reminded of the need to report cases.

Travel can increase the risk of exposure to measles virus and its spread into susceptible populations who are not vaccinated. Schools should be told to remind parents to check and address gaps, if necessary, in their children's immunisation status before travelling to areas with measles outbreaks. Immunisation is the only effective preventive measure against acquiring measles.

Travellers to the Alsace region of France who have not been immunised with 2 doses of MCV are at risk of being exposed to measles the same way as when travelling to any area where measles transmission is occurring. As the measles vaccine is highly effective, vaccination should be recommended to all who are not, or not fully, immunised (and for whom there are no contra-indications), particularly, but not only, those who may be at higher risk of exposure associated with travel.

Situation in Western Europe generally
--------------------------------
Measles outbreaks continue to occur in Europe because of low vaccination coverage in some countries and pockets of susceptible people who are either un- or under-immunised.

For controlling the outbreaks in Europe, the primary goal of response should be to implement control measures in all affected countries through immunisation activities targeting people at risk. In addition, all countries should strive to maintain a very high coverage of regular measles vaccination in order to prevent future outbreaks.

Event background information
--------------------------
Since 10 Apr 2015, an increase in the number of measles cases has been noticed in the Alsace region in France, in the district of Haut-Rhin: Colmar, Logelbach and Ribeauville. As of 3 May 2015, 67 cases had been notified to the Regional Health Agency of Alsace (ARS Alsace).

The median age of cases was 15 years (range 2-23 years). Eleven cases have been laboratory confirmed, 51 had an epidemiological link and 5 were clinically compatible. Four cases had received one dose of measles-containing vaccine; all other cases were unvaccinated.

The onset of symptoms among reported cases ranges from 15 Mar 2015 until recent days (as of 23 Apr 2015). Outside the Alsace region, less than 30 cases of measles have been reported in France during the period 1 Jan to 27 Apr 2015. Investigations conducted by health authorities have identified 4 affected schools in the district. All reported cases have attended a music school in Colmar, France or have been in direct contact with cases who had.

39 cases attend an anthroposophical private school (receiving children aged 2 to 20 years of age). Six cases attend a 1st grade secondary school (11 to 15 year-olds), 14 attend a 2nd grade secondary school (15 to 20 year-olds). Eight cases are family members of other cases or have a possible social link (http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/measles-rapid-risk-assessment-France-may-2015).

Germany has been experiencing a measles outbreak since October 2014 that involves 1134 cases reported as of 22 Apr 2015, the ECDC said. Alsace officials are encouraging vaccination and conducting contact tracing.

Main conclusions and options for response:
--------------------------------------
An outbreak of measles involving 67 cases (median age 15 years) has been reported in the French region of Alsace, in the department of Haut-Rhin bordering Germany and Switzerland. The French index case had most probably been infected during a school trip to Berlin, following contact with a confirmed case in the German host family. Due to the low vaccination coverage among the students in the French anthroposophical school, the virus spread rapidly, leading to secondary cases in siblings and friends of the infected student. Given that the reported vaccination coverage for the 1st dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) in France is below 90 percent and considering the current school holiday period in the region, it is considered possible that this situation will continue to involve Germany and Switzerland.

[According to the ECDC, French officials have reported a measles outbreak involving at least 67 cases in the Alsace region in northeastern France, which borders Germany and Switzerland, according to a report late last week from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The French index case had most probably been infected during a school trip to Berlin, following contact with a confirmed case in the German host family. An increase in cases in the region was 1st noted in early April 2015. As of 3 May 2015, 67 cases were reported to regional health authorities. Of them, 11 have been lab confirmed, 51 are epidemiologically linked, and 5 were "clinically compatible." Four patients had received only one dose of measles vaccine, with the rest unvaccinated. Fewer than 30 cases have been reported outside the Alsace region in France this year [2015].

All reported case-patients attended a music school in Colmar, France or had direct contact with patients who had. 59 are students at one of 3 schools in the region, while 8 cases involve family members of people with a possible social link. - Mod.CP

The number of suspected and confirmed measles cases in the Philippines more than doubled during the past month, according to World Health Organization data. The number of cases for the 1st 3 months of 2015 is now 1320. This is up from 561 just the month before. An additional measles fatality has also been reported in March 2015, bringing the total to 2. In all of 2014, the Philippines saw 58 010 suspected cases of measles, including 21 420 confirmed cases and 110 deaths.

China
-----
In China, the health authorities put the total measles case count from January to March 2015 at 32 819. This includes 13 measles deaths. The case count nearly doubled in China through February 2015; 18 520 suspected and confirmed cases were reported.

Other countries
--------------
Other countries in Asia reporting high numbers of measles cases include Malaysia (885) and Viet Nam and Mongolia, both registering more than 300 cases each.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that mainly affects children. It is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms usually appear 10-12 days after infection, and include high fever, runny nose, bloodshot eyes, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck gradually spreading downwards. Measles can be prevented by immunization. There is no specific treatment, and most people recover within 2-3 weeks. However, measles can cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infections and pneumonia, particularly in malnourished children and people with reduced immunity.

An outbreak of measles in the local community has prompted health experts to encourage parents to get their children vaccinated against the disease. Public Health England (PHE) is asking parents to take their children to the GP to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab following the confirmed outbreak in Devon. PHE has confirmed 2 cases of measles in the Ashburton area (just 25 miles from the Cornwall border) and 3 other suspected cases in the local area.

Letters have been issued to parents at local schools advising them that measles is circulating in the community and to ensure their children are fully protected against the condition by having 2 doses of the MMR vaccine.

Dr Nick Young, consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health England in Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, said: "While most people who catch measles will recover completely within a couple of weeks, it's important to remember measles can be a very serious illness that can leave permanent disability, and occasionally even kill. "I'd appeal to any parents who have not yet had their children vaccinated to get them protected as soon as possible through their GP. Children should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine for maximum protection, MMR not only protects them, but also limits the chances of the virus spreading more widely, for example to children who are too young to have the vaccine and to adults who may be more vulnerable to the disease. It is important to remember that MMR is a highly effective and safe vaccine."

Two doses of the MMR vaccine offer full protection against the 3 illnesses, provided the 1st dose is given after 12 months of age and the 2nd after 18 months of age. Unless advised otherwise, parents should follow the recommended NHS vaccination schedule. The vaccine may also protect children if given within 72 hours of exposure to someone with measles. If already infected with measles, the MMR will not cause any harm.

Medical Officer of Health Dr Rob Weir says: "MidCentral DHB had its 1st case of laboratory confirmed measles since 2011 earlier this week. The Mid-Central Public Health Service has acted to minimise the risk of further spread. These actions have included advising those close contacts that are not vaccinated or immune from previous measles infection to stay at home for 2 weeks after last exposure to the case."

Dr Weir said: "Measles is a very infectious disease, so anyone who is not immune to measles is at risk if they come into contact with the disease. It spreads from person to person through the air from breathing, coughing and sneezing, and contact with those secretions. The disease is contagious from just before symptoms begin until about 5 days after onset of the rash. The illness usually starts between 10 and 14 days after contact with the measles virus."

Measles symptoms include: fever, runny nose, cough, and sore red eyes. After 3-5 days, a rash appears on the head and spreads down the body. Dr Weir said: "For every 1000 cases of measles, approximately 100 will need hospital treatment, 100 will develop an ear infection, and 50 will progress to pneumonia. "This case is a reminder that measles can occur at any time. Vaccination is the best way for people to protect themselves against measles and is free to those who need it. You can protect both yourself and the community by getting vaccinated."

Dr Weir said: "Anyone who thinks they may have measles should stay away from work, school or public places. If you think you might have measles, I recommend you contact your GP (by phone 1st) or Healthline on 0800 611116 for more advice. It is very important you tell your GP that you think you might have measles before going into the surgery."
