The number of dead fish taken from Wadley-Barron Park has skyrocketed to
8000. According to city's Director of Community Services Monette Burke,
the condition expected to be causing the die off -- golden algae bloom --
could result in a total extinction of fish in the 2.3 acre Central Midland
park. "Usually in these cases, it is a total kill," Ms. Burke said. "There
isn't anything which can be done. That is what we are being told."
According to Ms. Burke, an official with the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission (TNRCC) who was in Midland performing tests has
stated preliminary tests indicate golden algae bloom as the reason for the
die off. She indicated the TNRCC is reporting similar problems exist
across the state -- including at the Pecos River and on some Central Texas
lakes.
According to Ms. Burke, golden algae bloom results when the water
conditions get right in a pond or other body of water. The algae releases a
toxin affecting the fish. It is not expected to affect turtles or other
wildlife which reside at the particular body of water.
The alarming figure is 8000-plus fish called Wadley-Barron home. It was
impossible for city officials to determine if there are any live fish left
in the pond or how many there actually were before the latest die off
began. City officials said cremation is the safest way of disposing of the
remains.
The city is also repairing 1 the 2 aerators usually located at the pond.

[Removing the dead fish is a good idea, as they could decompose and present
a medium for botulism which could affect birds feeding on the dead fish. It
is curious that water conditions became right to support the algae bloom at
the same time an aerator is being repaired. - Mod.TG]
