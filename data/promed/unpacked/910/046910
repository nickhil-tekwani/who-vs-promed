"There are 15 lumpy skin disease outbreaks. The territory we have outlined with the Ministry of Agriculture and Food for disinfection spraying covers the affected settlements in the districts of Stara Zagora and Haskovo," said Dr Georgi Chobanov, director of the Healthcare, Humane Approach towards Animals and Fodder Control Directorate with the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency, speaking for FOCUS News Agency, commenting on the disinfection spraying against the disease.

According to him, a circle of a 30 km [about 19 mile] radius has been outlined around each outbreak.

The National Federation Pro Agro Action has obtained extensive information on outbreaks of viral nodular dermatitis [lumpy skin disease]. The organisation received information from colleagues in UECBV [the European Livestock and Meat Trading Union] in Brussels [Belgium], which sounded the alarm about the danger of the disease spreading. "As we are informed by UECBV, the crisis has already begun by Turkey's banning the entry of animals which have been in transit through Bulgaria. Currently, about 30 trucks with animals are blocked at the Bulgarian border with Turkey (information provided by border inspectors).

The 1st lumpy skin disease outbreak was notified by Bulgaria to the OIE on 14 Apr 2016. After 7 days and without earlier notice, the Turkish authorities decided to reject shipments that passed through Bulgaria. Turkey has experienced outbreaks of this disease in 2013, at the border with Greece. Secretariat UECBV requested the immediate reaction of the European Commission services to the Turkish authorities on the ground that:
1. there is no justification to stop these trucks which have passed through less-affected regions [in Bulgaria];
2. no prior notice has been given;
3. lumpy skin disease is endemic in Turkey.

UECBV is expected to suggest the following to the European Commission:
1. The currently detained trucks should be allowed entry to Turkey more, especially considering the severely compromised animal welfare.
2. Bovine animals originating in member states free from lumpy skin disease should be granted acceptance, even if transported through Bulgaria, considering the fact that shipments do not pass through the infected region.
3. The animal health situation in Turkey should be taken into account.

ACEBOP calls for urgent publication and dissemination through the media of the preventive measures undertaken by the Romanian authorities to reduce the possibility of disease, including measures to reduce the risk taken at the border with Bulgaria. We believe that the risk increases daily in view of the approaching Easter and summer holidays when traffic intensity will increase on the border with Bulgaria. The communique concluded: "our farmers, already experiencing crisis due to BSE [bovine spongiform encephalopathy], bluetongue, low prices and closed markets, are desperate. They need immediate protective measures for animals and for trade".

[Lumpy skin disease has spread, very recently, to Bulgaria's western neighbor -- the Former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) of Macedonia. This has already been reported to the OIE (20160423.4177438). International trade restrictions in such cases are not surprising. However, when dealing with a vectorborne disease, animal movement restrictions, while justified (and prescribed in detail by internationally agreed conventions and protocols), even if strictly abided to, are only partially sufficient to control/prevent the disease. Windborne vectors recognize no political borders.

A resembling situation was encountered when BTV-8 [bluetongue virus serotype 8] spread in northern and later central Europe, several years ago, requiring the wide application of an (inactivated!) vaccine in some countries, followed by some adjustments in the international trade requirements.

ProMED-mail has published requests for information on the ongoing research project addressing inactivated lumpy skin disease vaccines. - Mod.AS
