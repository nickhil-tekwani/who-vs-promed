Tuberculosis, the "white plague," is returning to London, which risks
the sort of serious outbreaks that occurred in New York and
California in the 1990s, an article in the Lancet medical journal
warns today [17 Dec 2010].

Nowhere else in Europe have TB rates continued to rise, says Dr
Alimuddin Zumla of the department of infection of University College
London medical school. "The incidence in the UK has gradually
increased over the past 15 years," he writes. Last year [2009], more
than 9000 cases were reported in the UK, with nearly 40 percent in
London. "This pattern is striking when compared with the general
decline in other European countries," he says.

TB, known as the white plague in Victorian Britain because of the
pallor of the patients, who were often confined to sanatoriums and
usually died, was thought to have been conquered by the early 1980s.
Antibiotic drugs, improved health services and the BCG vaccination
brought it firmly under control.

In recent years, however, it has undergone a resurgence, worsened by
the prevalence of HIV, which damages the body's defensive immune
system. Currently, 1.7 million people die of TB every year around the
world. Because of the difficulties in complying with a 6-month regime
of antibiotic treatment, strains of TB bacteria have become resistant
to the commonly used drugs.

In London too, says Zumla, drug-resistant TB has been on the increase
over the past decade. Last year [2009], 172 TB cases were resistant
to isoniazid, the standard antibiotic treatment. A further 58 cases
were resistant to more than one drug.

TB thrives in areas of deprivation. The increase in numbers has been
largely in people who were not born in the UK, but in 2009, most of
them (85 percent) had lived in the country for at least 2 years. Many
are living in conditions familiar in Dickens's time. "Poor housing,
inadequate ventilation and overcrowding -- conditions prevalent in
Victorian Britain -- are causes of the higher tuberculosis incidence
rates in certain London boroughs," writes Zumla.

The disease spreads in the close conditions found in shelters for the
homeless. It is also in prisons. Zumla calls for immediate and
long-term political and financial commitment from the government "if
the tide is to be turned against the return of the white plague in
London, and if tuberculosis is to be controlled."

Events in the United States provide a warning, writes Zumla. "The
ominous situation in London is reminiscent of the unexpected
outbreaks of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in New York and
California prisons in the early 1990s, which arose as a result of
complacency of the respective states' surveillance and control
programmes. A large financial investment, with political and legal
support, was required to re-establish control."

[A recent ProMED-mail post that mainly concerned tuberculosis in
children in the UK incidentally also reported that there were 9153
new cases among adults and children recorded in the UK in 2009, the
largest annual increase (5.5 percent) since 2005, and 9 out of 10
cases (or 8238 cases) occurred in ethnic minorities (see ProMED-mail
post Tuberculosis, children - UK: use of BCG vaccine 20100717.2386).

With an estimated population in the UK of 61 792 000 in 2009
(<http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=6>), the overall
incidence of TB is 14.8 per 100 000. With about 8 percent of the
population in the UK in 2001, or almost 5 million people, belonging
to non-white ethnic groups (that include mostly South Asians)
(<http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=455>), the incidence
of TB in these ethnic minorities is about 165 per 100 000.

For comparison, the epidemiology of TB in the U.S. has been extracted
from a CDC publication, TB Today (<http://www.cdcnpin.org/scripts/tb/tb.asp>):

There was a resurgence of tuberculosis cases in the USA between 1985
and 1992 that was caused by: the onset of the HIV epidemic; increases
in TB cases among foreign-born persons; outbreaks in congregate
settings (correctional facilities and homeless shelters);
deterioration of the infrastructure for TB services; and the
development of difficult-to-treat cases of multiple drug resistant
(MDR) TB. TB cases reported to CDC for 2005 represented a 47 percent
decrease from 1992, when the number of cases and the case rate
peaked. In 2005, the 13th consecutive year of decline, the TB case
rate was 4.8 per 100 000. This reduction has been attributed to more
effective TB-control programs that emphasize prompt identification of
persons with TB, prompt initiation of appropriate therapy, and
efforts to ensure that therapy will be completed.

The recent success in TB control in the U.S. is tempered by the
burden of TB among foreign-born persons residing in this country. The
case rate among foreign-born persons is now at least 8 times higher
than among U.S.-born persons. In 1991, 73 percent of reported TB
cases were among U.S.-born persons (8.2 cases per 100 000) while 27
percent were in foreign-born persons (33.9 per 100 000). In
comparison, 55 percent of TB cases in 2005 occurred in the foreign
born. From 2001 through 2005, the top 5 countries of origin of
foreign-born persons with TB were Mexico, the Philippines, Viet Nam,
India, and China.

This CDC publication also points out the challenge to TB control that
shifting immigrant migration patterns within the U.S. pose for some
low-incidence states or local communities with minimal TB control
programs. These jurisdictions may be ill-equipped to handle an abrupt
increase of TB cases and unfamiliar cultural issues.
