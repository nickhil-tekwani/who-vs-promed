If it is definitely downy mildew; maybe they should relax the rules on using phosphonic acid based products in grapes early in the season. This is old chemistry but effective and doesn't leave the heavy metals residues in the soil associated with years of using Bordeaux mixture (copper sulfate) or copper oxychloride. It's allowed in some countries not in others.

Potassium phosphite is a very effective fungicide on oomycetes. It is available in some countries as a foliar fertiliser. Potassium as a fertiliser toughens cell walls and there is an elicitor response as well to stimulate the plant's own defence response systems.

[Our grateful thanks go to Frank Visser for these valuable comments.

Oomycetes are fungus-like eucariots previously classified as fungi. They include some of the most devastating plant pathogens (such as _Phytophthora infestans_, the cause of late blight of potato). Downy mildews include many species of oomycetes in several genera which cause similar symptoms on a range of hosts, including many crops. Individual species usually have a narrow host range affecting only one or a few different hosts.

Phosphorous compounds have also been shown to be effective against diseases of trees caused by other oomycetes in the genus _Phytophthora_ (for example, see ProMED-mail posts 20180523.5813416, 20160404.4137142, and 20151029.3751425). They are applied as trunk injections which need to be repeated whenever protection is required. This method is being used in the control of _Phytophthora cinnamomi_ in, for example, jarrah dieback and avocado root rot in Australia. The mode of the protective action of these compounds against _Phytophthora_ species is still being investigated.
