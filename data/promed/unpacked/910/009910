A total of 5 of 21 people who fell ill after eating frozen cutlets sold by a company in Hiratsuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, have been found to suffer from foodborne infection from the O157 strain of the _Escherichia coli_ bacterium, prefectural health officials said on Tue 1 Nov 2016.

The patients' symptoms included abdominal pain and diarrhea. The O157 strain was detected from the cutlets and the patients' stools. The frozen cutlets, made of minced beef and pork, were sold by the meat company Niku No Ishikawa, according to the prefectural officials. The best-before date of the products, made by a company in neighboring Shizuoka Prefecture on behalf of Niku No Ishikawa, was set at 26 Feb 2017.

The cutlets were sold at 26 Ito-Yokado Co supermarkets in Kanagawa and Chiba Prefecture. Ito-Yokado, a unit of Seven & I Holdings Co, had removed all of the products from its stores as of Wed [2 Nov 2016]. The Kanagawa Prefectural Government is calling on purchasers of the cutlets not to eat them and contact the stores where they were bought.

[It is not stated whether the frozen cutlets were pre- or partially cooked. Inadequate cooking, especially in a microwave oven where the heat is not always uniformly distributed, may be at fault. - Mod.LL
