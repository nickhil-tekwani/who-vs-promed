[While the laboratory results refer both to swine and cattle, the
notification mentions disease (and stamping out) in swine only. This
is in need of clarification.

Among the control measures applied, dipping/spraying is included on
top of 'Disinfection of infected premises.' While the latter is
indeed a common, prescribed measure in relation to FMD, the
application of dipping/spraying is in need of explanation.

The current outbreak is the 5th since the start of the serotype O
outbreak in China, reportedly on 22 Feb 2010. A look at the map
accompanying the OIE summary, will demonstrate the widely-separated
distribution of the disease in China; see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8988>.
It is also noteworthy to remind the earlier notified detection of an
infected transported consignment of cattle in distant, north-west
China (posting 20100403.1072), attributed (and signed on the map) to
the site of origin of these animals, in Shanxi. Earlier outbreaks of
the serotype O strain during the current epizootic, involved,
reportedly, cattle and swine.

In view of the high infectivity/invasiveness and wide-spectrum of
susceptible host species when FMDV serotype O is the virus in
question, involving, at least, cattle and swine while the latter are
known to be extremely prolific producers of the virus, the Chinese
policy, namely refraining from vaccination while relying upon early
detection of cases, accompanied by stamping-out (culling of all
infected, suspected and in-contact animals), is rather daring.
Hopefully, leading to early eradication. - Mod.AS]
