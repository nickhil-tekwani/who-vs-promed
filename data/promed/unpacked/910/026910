The state of Valle is under alert due to an outbreak of classical swine
fever (CSF) in the [neighboring] state of Quindio.
This year, authorities have detected the disease in the municipalities of
Calarca, Circasia, Armenia, Filandia, and La Tebaida, in the state of
Quindio.
Gerardo Villalobos Azcarate, Secretary of Agriculture and Fisheries of
Valle, said that a barrier must be put in place in the state and that the
local mayors and directors of UMATA [Municipal Agricultural Technical
Assistance Unit] in the different municipalities have been urged to take
the necessary steps to prevent the introduction of the disease into the
state.
Villalobos added that, due to their geographic location, the high-risk
municipalities are Obando, Caicedonia, Sevilla, Cartago, Ulloa, and Alcala.
The Quindio branch of the Colombian Institute of Agriculture (ICA), through
Resolution 013, has declared a quarantine in that region of the
country. The resolution bans the transport of pigs to and from the
jurisdiction of this coffee-producing Colombian state.
State authorities have requested that any indication of the disease be
reported to the nearest ICA office. Symptoms include fever, loss of
equilibrium, weakness, and difficulty walking.
According to the statistics of the Secretariat of Agriculture and
Fisheries, in the state of Valle there are 204 000 pigs. Should the
epidemic reach there, the financial consequences for farmers would be
catastrophic.
Villalobos explained that the financial losses resulting from classical
swine fever are due to the mortality that leads to shortages of meat, to
the additional feeding and vaccination costs, and to the cancellation of
sales contracts. The losses could amount to US$11 million per year.
In order to prevent the dissemination of the disease, vaccination of all
swine is now mandatory. Alvaro Abisambra, national General Manager of ICA,
announced that in an effort to prevent the spread of the disease, the
agency would initiate an aggressive vaccination campaign, in conjunction
with a ban on the transportation of swine.
Last year, classical swine fever, a disease believed to have been
eradicated from Colombia, resulted in a loss to farmers of US$15 million.
