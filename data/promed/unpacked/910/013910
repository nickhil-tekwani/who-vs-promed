Thailand: suspected bird flu cases now total 112
------------------------------------------------
The Thai public health authorities have admitted that 112 people from 14
provinces suspected of having contracted avian influenza are being
monitored, according to the state-run Thai News Agency. Prat
Boonyawongvirot, the permanent secretary for public health of Thailand, was
quoted as saying that the patients had been admitted for further laboratory
tests for [avian influenza virus infection]. No new cases have been
reported, however, and no new cases of avian influenza have been confirmed,
the report said.
Prat said health officers were also closely monitoring about 3 dozen
medical personnel and 3 other people who looked after the 17 year old youth
who died of confirmed avian influenza in the northern province of Phichit
last Monday [24 Jul 2006].
Although no further cases of bird flu have been confirmed, public health
authorities met on Saturday [29 Jul 2006] in both Phichit and the
neighboring Phitsanulok Province to assess the situation and work out
stricter bird flu control measures. So far, no H5N1 virus has been found.
Nonetheless, physicians, nurses and public health officials were told to be
more alert for people suspected to have contracted the disease.

[The Thai Ministry of Health website regularly lists the number of people
under observation for possible avian influenza virus infection, together
with the number of suspected and confirmed cases; see
<http://thaigcd.ddc.moph.go.th/AI_case_report_060729.html>.
As of 29 Jul 2006, there have been a single confirmed case and 80 cases
"under observation." None was assessed as "suspected". It is likely that
the 112 "suspected" cases referred to in the above report should be
considered as "under observation". - Mod.CP]
