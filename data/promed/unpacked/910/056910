Cornell plant pathologists have issued a warning to New York apple and pear growers. For 50 years, fireblight has been kept at bay using the antibiotic streptomycin, but streptomycin-resistant strains of the disease were recently found in 4 locations in Wayne and Ontario counties.

"This is a serious situation. The rapid identification of this outbreak positions us to implement a coordinated plan leading up to next year's [2012] growing season," said Herb Aldwinckle, New York State Agricultural Experiment Station (NYSAES), who is developing guidelines to reduce the threat.

Strep-resistant fire blight was 1st identified in California in 1971, and since then, it has been found in Washington, Oregon, Missouri, and southwest Michigan. Diseased nursery trees from Michigan were the source of an outbreak in New York in 2002, but eradication appears to have been effective. For this current infection, sampling was necessarily limited in late fall [2011], so the full extent of the outbreak is as yet unclear.

Aldwinckle said the fact that one of the sites is a nursery does complicate the management plan. Some infections might not be immediately visible, so there's a possibility that trees with the strain were inadvertently shipped to growers. He advises to examine trees carefully after planting.

He is also exploring other ways to eradicate the blight. "The antibiotic kasugamycin is as effective and is not used in human or veterinary medicine," he said. Cornell is leading an application for an emergency registration from the Environmental Protection Agency to use kasugamycin next spring [2012].

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince and apple are susceptible, although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only members of the _Rosaceae_ are affected, mainly the sub-family _Maloideae_ (synonym _Pomoideae_), but also many cultivated rose and bramble varieties. The known host range covers more than 140 species from 40 genera. Many ornamental and weed species serve as pathogen reservoirs for crop infections.

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend forming black hooks; some fruit may show lesions; cankers appear on branches and trunks, and trees invariably die. The bacteria enter the host plant through wounds and are highly infectious. They are spread by insect activity (including pollinators), wind, water (rain, irrigation), mechanical means (tools, orchard workers), and with plant material (including budwood). Importation of plant material including fruit (shipments may also contain contaminated leaf or twig fragments) from areas with endemic fireblight poses a considerable quarantine risk.

The pathogens overwinter almost exclusively in cankers on limbs infected during the previous season, and consequently, the amount of inoculum and thus the risk of outbreaks are increased following years with high fireblight levels.

Phytosanitation and monitoring are used to attempt exclusion of fireblight from individual orchards. Disease management may include cultural measures (such as removal of pathogen reservoirs) and bacteriocidal sprays. Currently, the most effective control is application of streptomycin during flowering, but the use of antibiotics in agriculture is mostly subject to strict regulations. Certain cultivar/rootstock combinations may provide some protection.

A continued spread of _E. amylovora_ to new areas and the emergence of new streptomycin resistant strains are a major concern. In the case of the streptomycin resistant strain(s) reported above, it is not clear whether they are considered new emerging strains or whether it is thought that they may have spread from the other parts of the US.
