Local veterinary authorities in eastern Romania announced yesterday
[18 Oct 2007] that around 2500 pigs will be slaughtered next week
following the discovery of swine fever in a nature park.

According to the head of the local veterinary authority, Gicu Dragan,
the outbreak was discovered last week, and slaughter will begin on
Monday [22 Oct 2007].

The pigs are wild and come from private farms around the park near Bralia.

This comes as a further blow to Romanian authorities, who had
initially announced in June 2007 that they had eradicated the disease
after discovering 716 cases in 2006.

50 000 pigs, however, were slaughtered on 3 farms belonging to the US
company Smithfield in August [2007] after swine fever was discovered
on them.

Brussels decided last month [September 2007] to extend its embargo on
Romanian pork until the end of 2009.

[Although it may be assumed with high certainty that the above
information pertains to classical swine fever, laboratory
confirmation is required to exclude even the slightest possibility
that African swine fever, recently reported from the Caucasus
(Georgia, Armenia, Abkhazia), may have spread.

No reports on the 2007 outbreaks have been submitted by Romania to
the OIE. OIE's WAHID interface website does not include any
information on the CSF situation in Romania since January 2005. -
