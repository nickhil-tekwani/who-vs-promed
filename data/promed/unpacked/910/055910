Ugandan Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak Now Officially Over
------------------------------------------------------------
The authorities in Uganda [have declared that the outbreak of Ebola
hemorrhagic fever in the country is at an end. The head of the National
Task Force that was dealing with it, Dr. Sam Okware, told the BBC that
there had been no new cases anywhere in the country [for 42 days and he
was assured that the epidemic was over. Ebola hemorrhagic fever struck the
district of Gulu, in northern Uganda, last September, claiming over 170 lives.

[On Tue 6 Feb 2001 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the
epidemic of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, which has killed 173 people in Uganda,
was effectively over. No new cases had been reported in the previous 21
days, the maximum incubation period for the disease. "We have to wait for
42 days, twice the maximum incubation period, before we can officially give
the all-clear," announced Dr. Oladapo Walker, the WHO Country
Representative in Uganda. The 42-day period has now expired and
consequently Uganda can be considered an Ebola-free zone. Accordingly this
thread is cut. - Mod.CP
