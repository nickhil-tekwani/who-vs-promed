Radio Mozambique published on 25 Jul 2000 from the station in Quelimane,
Zambezia province, Mozambique, that on 23 Jul 2000 a child died from Rabies
after having been bitten by a dog. It was the seventh lethal case this year
in Zambezia province (3.1 million habitants). Street dogs have bitten 107
people who registered for treatment this year, most of them in the City of
Quelimane and in the districts of Mocuba and Alto Molocue. The stock of
vaccines against rabies is reported to be insufficient.
