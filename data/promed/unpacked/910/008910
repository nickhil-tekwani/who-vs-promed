Bluetongue detected in Suffolk
------------------------------
Laboratory tests have detected the presence of bluetongue in one cow on a
premises near Ipswich, Suffolk. Bluetongue is a very different infection to
foot and mouth disease [FMD] and the strategy to control it is therefore
also different. This is not a confirmed outbreak unless further
investigation demonstrates that disease is circulating.
Bluetongue is a disease of animals. It does not affect humans. This is a
disease of ruminants, including sheep, cattle, deer, camelids and goats. It
is transmitted by the movement of midges or by movements of infected
animals if they are subsequently bitten by midges.
The premises where bluetongue has been found is under restrictions. The one
infected animal will be culled and epidemiological investigations are being
carried out to assess the situation.
This is the first time bluetongue virus has been recorded in the UK.
Notes to editors:
1. Further information on bluetongue can be found on the DEFRA website at:
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007//animalh/diseases/notifiable/bluetongue/index.htm>www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/bluetongue/index.htm>.
2. DEFRA has been working in close partnership with the industry to develop
the Bluetongue Control Strategy and has jointly been involved in raising
awareness of this disease.
3. The Health Protection Agency advise that people who have visited the
affected premises do not need to be concerned that there is any risk to
their health.

First UK case of bluetongue virus
---------------------------------
Bluetongue disease has been found in the UK for the first time -- in a cow
at a farm near Ipswich, Suffolk, government officials have said.
The insectborne virus is usually found around the Mediterranean but nearly
3000 cases in northern Europe since July had fuelled fears of its UK arrival.
Cattle, sheep, goats and deer can all be infected, but the viral infection
is not thought to pose a risk to humans.
The find comes as foot and mouth disease continues to hit Surrey farms.
Bluetongue disease is transmitted by the _Culicoides imicola_ midge [see
commentary]. It is passed from animal to midge, and from midge to animal,
but is not transmitted from animal to animal. The virus has long blighted
Africa, but in recent years has begun to spread northwards into Europe as
the range of the biting insects has increased. Some scientists believe that
climate change could be behind its spread, as warmer temperatures have seen
the midges gradually move north.
Animals with the disease experience discomfort, with flu-like symptoms, and
swelling and haemorrhaging in and around the mouth and nose. They can also
go lame and have difficulty eating properly.
"The premises where bluetongue has been found is under restrictions. One
infected animal will be culled and epidemiological investigations are being
carried out to assess the situation," said the Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). DEFRA said that bluetongue disease was
different from foot-and-mouth, but many of the precautions already in place
may help to control its spread.
No vaccine is available currently for the strain of the disease that has
hit northern Europe, where export and animal movement bans have been
imposed following outbreaks. Once infected, up to 70 per cent of a flock of
sheep can die from the virus. While infected animals can recover -- and
become immune -- productivity is reduced with milk yields in dairy herds
dropping by about 40 per cent.
Professor Hugh Pennington, a microbiologist, told the BBC that the wide
ranging zones restricting animal movements would have severe a economic
impact on the farming industry. "It would be very bad news if this virus
got established here," he said.
Anthony Gibson, of the National Farmers Union, said he expected much of
East Anglia and the East Midlands to be covered by a surveillance zone,
"stretching out for 150km in every direction from the farm on which this
animal has been identified".
In Scotland, where in July scientists began researching the midge
population in response to the spread of the virus, the government urged
farmers to watch for signs of the disease in their livestock. "Bluetongue
can have a significant effect on the livestock sector and our best defence
is good biosecurity and vigilance for signs of disease," a spokesman said.

ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall
[Bluetongue is an insectborne disease of ruminants, caused by the
bluetongue virus (BTV), a member of the genus _Orbivirus_ and family
_Reoviridae_. Twenty-four serotypes of BTV have been identified worldwide.
BTV is transmitted by biting midges of the genus _Culicoides_. Different
_culicoides_ species are the vectors of bluetongue in different parts of
the world; _C. imicola_ is the main vector in Africa, the Middle East, and
southern Europe, into which the disease has spread since the late 1990s.
Contrary to the information provided in the BBC report above, _C. imicola_
is not present in the UK nor in the north west European countries which
have been infected by BTV, for the 1st time, in 2006 -- Belgium, the
Netherlands, France, Germany, and Luxembourg. The species suspected to be
responsible for the transmission of the BTV in those countries was
initially found to belong to the _Culicoides obsoletus_ complex; there is
growing evidence that the species _C. dewulfi_ may play an important role
in the recent north west European outbreaks (see post 20061024.3042).
Among domestic animals, clinical disease occurs most often in sheep, and
can result in significant morbidity. Some strains of the virus can result
in mortality rates as high as 70 per cent in highly susceptible sheep.
Other ruminants, such as cattle and goats are readily bitten by the midge
and infected, but usually subclinically only. Unfortunately, the serotype
BTV-8, which is the one responsible for the current outbreak in north west
Europe, causes clinical disease in cattle as well, which at times can be
serious. Most likely, BTV-8 is the virus which has now spread to Suffolk.
The bluetongue virus has recently expanded its geographic range. Before
1998, this virus rarely occurred in Europe; however, some serotypes are now
regularly found in southern European countries and may have become enzootic
in this region. In 2006, BTV-8, which may have come from Africa, caused
outbreaks in the above mentioned countries in NW Europe.
There should be no illusions about the possibility to eradicate the BTV
once it circulates within an ecologically receptive area. Quarantine
measures and culling will not prevent the disease, though can somewhat slow
its spread -- which may continue until the first frost. If the positive cow
in Suffolk has been infected locally, there is already an endemic
population of infected efficient vectors in the region. There is no
practical way to remove culicoides or prevent them from biting domestic
animals. The sad truth is, that the only efficient way to prevent losses,
which -- particularly in sheep -- may be very heavy, is vaccination. Other
measures may somewhat diminish the losses but will not prevent them.
The DEFRA press release does not mention the way the case was diagnosed nor
the presence or absence of clinical symptoms. The said data, as well as the
serotyping of the BTV involved, are anticipated.
One can but wish DEFRA success in the extremely difficult task of dealing
with both FMD and BT epizootics simulataneously. - Mod.AS]
