Early in October 2007, an increase in notifications of human cases infected
with Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) O157 was seen in
the Netherlands. All cases reported diarrhea, and most also had bloody
diarrhea. No cases developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The onset of
illness for the 1st cases was in mid-September 2007 (figure 1 [see source
at the URL above. - Mod.LL])

STEC O157 strains that contained both stx1 and stx2 genes were isolated
from 36 patients. Subtyping of these isolates by pulse-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) showed, for 33 cases, an identical pattern not
previously observed in the Netherlands. One further isolate was nearly
identical to the 33. The 2 remaining isolates, which were isolated from the
siblings of a confirmed case, have not yet been typed.

The PFGE pattern was compared to the pattern found in Iceland, which
appeared to be identical. The Iceland outbreak of STEC O157 is described in
an accompanying article in this issue (1) [see below - Mod.LL].

The age and sex distribution of the cases is shown in figure 2 [see source
at the URL above. - Mod.LL]. Most cases (67 per cent) were between 10 and
50 years of age. More females than males were affected in these age groups.
The cases were distributed across the whole country, with a concentration
of the cases in the western part.

As part of enhanced surveillance, all laboratory-confirmed STEC patients in
the Netherlands are asked to fill in a questionnaire on symptoms and
exposures in the week before illness onset. For the year 2007,
questionnaires were available for 31 cases of the current outbreak and 37
STEC cases that had occurred earlier in 2007. A case-to-case comparison
revealed raw vegetables as the possible source of the outbreak (71 per cent
of the outbreak cases had consumed raw vegetables, compared with 49 per
cent of the earlier cases, p=0.06).

Municipal health services undertook further trawling interviews with the
current outbreak cases, which pointed towards pre-packaged shredded iceberg
lettuce purchased at several supermarket chains as the possible source.

The environmental investigation is continuing. The Dutch Food and Safety
Authority (FSA) is investigating the distribution channels of packed fresh
vegetables and the individual ingredients. Samples of lettuce and other raw
vegetables are being taken, as well as environmental samples at vegetable
growers and shredding plants that may be involved. One shredding company
for fresh vegetables also cuts and packs lettuce products for Iceland.

An alert was sent by the Dutch FSA to the Rapid Alert System for Food and
Feed on 26 Oct 2007 (2).

From 28 Sep to 22 Oct 2007, 9 domestically acquired cases of Shiga toxin
(Stx)-producing _E. coli_ (STEC) O157 were diagnosed in Iceland, one of
which is probably a secondary case. The cases were between 2 and 61 years
of age, 5 males, and 4 females. All except 2 were treated in hospital, one
with elevated creatinine levels. No cases developed hemolytic uremic
syndrome (HUS).

The onset of symptoms was between 23 Sep and 18 Oct 2007. The cases reside
in different parts of the country: 4 in the area of Reykjavik, 2 in the
north of Iceland, one in the east of Iceland, and 2 in the Westman Islands
(figure [see source at URL above. - Mod.LL]).

8 of the 9 patients (presumed secondary case was excluded) answered a
trawling questionnaire on food consumption, travel, and mass gathering;
supermarket purchase records were collected from 3 cases. The results from
the questionnaires showed that 7 had eaten fish or ham, and 6 had eaten
lettuce. The source of infection is unknown at this point.

5 cases had eaten lettuce packaged and imported from the Netherlands, as
verified either by questionnaire (3 cases) or by supermarket purchase
records (2 cases). Intensified surveillance in lettuce with increased
sampling began in mid-October 2007 and is ongoing. Culture results have so
far been negative.

The strain that caused the outbreak in Iceland was identified by the
Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens at the Health Protection Agency in the
United Kingdom as STEC O157, phage type 8, carrying the stx1 and stx2 shiga
toxin genes. The PFGE pattern of all 9 Icelandic isolates was identical to
the strain that caused the current STEC O157 outbreak in the Netherlands.
That outbreak is described in an accompanying article in this issue [see
[1] above.]

[The vehicle is not yet established but may be the Netherlands-produced
lettuce. It will be interesting to find out if the produce had been sent to
other countries. Fresh produce is a recognized source for E. coli O157. -
