Case Count Update
----
Since the last update on 19 Nov 2015, 50 more ill people have been reported from 16 states. Illnesses that occurred after 21 Dec 2015 might not be reported yet. A series of events occurs between the time a person is infected and the time public health officials can determine that the person is part of an outbreak. This means that there will be a delay between when a person gets sick and confirmation that he or she is part of an outbreak. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

As of 21 Jan 2016, 888 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Poona have been reported from 39 states. The number of ill people reported from each state is as follows: Alabama (1), Alaska (19), Arizona (134), Arkansas (13), California (241), Colorado (21), Connecticut (1), Florida (1), Hawaii (1), Idaho (26), Illinois (11), Indiana (5), Iowa (7), Kansas (2), Kentucky (1), Louisiana (5), Maryland (1), Minnesota (43), Missouri (15), Montana (16), Nebraska (8), Nevada (17), New Hampshire (1), New Mexico (35), New York (6), North Dakota (8), Ohio (3), Oklahoma (13), Oregon (23), Pennsylvania (2), South Carolina (10), South Dakota (3), Tennessee (1), Texas (52), Utah (62), Virginia (1), Washington (26), Wisconsin (46), and Wyoming (7).

Among people for whom information is available, illnesses started on dates ranging from 3 Jul 2015 to 6 Jan 2016. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 99, with a median age of 18. 49 percent of ill people are children younger than 18 years. 56 percent of ill people are female. Among 686 people with available information, 191 (28 percent) report being hospitalized. 6 deaths have been reported from Arizona (1), California (3), Oklahoma (1), and Texas (1). According to the California Department of Public Health, Salmonella infection was not considered to be a contributing factor in 2 of the 3 deaths in California.

Investigation Update
----
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of _S._ Poona isolates from ill people and from contaminated cucumbers distributed by Andrew & Williamson Fresh Produce showed that the strains are closely related genetically. These results also included isolates from people who became ill in October and November 2015.

The number of reported illnesses has declined substantially since the peak of illnesses in August and September 2015; however, it has not returned to the number of reported illnesses that we would expect to see (about 1 every month during this time of year).

106 illnesses started after 24 Sep 2015, when recalled cucumbers should have no longer been available in stores or restaurants. If any of the recalled cucumbers were still available, they would have spoiled by that time. State and local public health officials have interviewed 38 of these ill people. 24 (63 percent) of them reported eating cucumbers in the week before their illness started. Interviews have not identified any additional food items potentially linked with illness. The investigation into the source of these recent illnesses is ongoing.

The source of contamination for cucumbers distributed by Andrew & Williamson Fresh Produce has not been identified. WGS results from recent illnesses suggest they share a common source with the illnesses during the peak of the outbreak in August and September 2015. Investigations are under way to determine if cross-contamination within the distribution chain for the recalled cucumbers could explain recent illnesses.

This investigation is ongoing. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

[As noted in the posting, the time span of this prolonged outbreak of _S._ Poona clearly has gone past when a contaminated lot of cucumbers would have spoiled. This certainly suggests that the source is still "out there" either in the field or later, involving cucumbers or other produce. - Mod.LL
