Public health officials are on alert after cases of a deadly
mosquito-borne disease were found in Columbus and New Hanover
counties. Crews sprayed for mosquitoes in Castle Hayne, after eastern
equine encephalomyelitis was found in a chicken flock that is
regularly tested for illnesses there.

A horse in Columbus County was recently put down after testing
positive for EEE.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, there is an average of
only 5 cases in humans in the US each year. However, EEE is one of
the deadliest mosquito-borne diseases. "We ask that people just be
sure if you're outside at dusk and dawn that you wear long sleeves or
long pants if possible," said Dave Jenkins of the New Hanover County
Environmental Health. "Apply DEET or some other insect repellent if
you're going to be out and you know the mosquitoes are biting."

Mosquitoes breed in even a little bit of stagnant water, so be sure
to regularly clean out old tires, rain gutters, and other areas
around your property.

[This is the 1st EEE report for North Carolina this year [2009].
Backyard chicken flocks make excellent sentinels for eastern equine
encephalitis and are used as such by most public health departments.
There is a vaccine for horses. The immunization against eastern
equine encephalitis is generally combined with that for West Nile
virus, so that one injection immunizes against both diseases. Horse
owners should ask for it. There are also appropriate mosquito
repellents for horses. Horses cannot transmit the virus to owners or
handlers. Mosquitoes carry the virus. - Mod.TG]

[Whatever the background immunity of human populations, horses are
always lethally susceptible unless vaccinated. Here in Louisiana, we
infrequently get human cases, and they are rarely severe; I think
there has been only one such in the past 30 years with permanent
damage, but equine cases are a constant even in "quiet" years.
Because we have mosquitoes essentially year round, I suspect the
human population is largely immune in some manner. Of course, in
states where mosquito seasons are short, the human disease risk is
higher. - Mod MHJ]
