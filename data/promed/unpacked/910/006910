Outbreak of Newcastle in Mash Central
--------------------------------------
Newcastle has broken out in some parts of Mashonaland Central Province and
killed thousands of chickens, veterinary officials said yesterday.
Provincial veterinary director Dr Josphat Nyika said a team of veterinary
officers had been dispatched to Matope and Kamutsenzere districts, where
the outbreak is most severe, to monitor the situation.
Dr Nyika said the diagnosis on the birds had been based on post-mortem and
symptoms. "We have taken brain and blood samples for confirmatory
laboratory diagnosis in Harare," he said.
He advised people in affected areas not to move chickens, as they are
susceptible to the disease, which is spread by an airborne virus.
He urged farmers to report any suspicious death of chickens to the nearest
veterinary offices.
Newcastle, a disease that is characterised by nervous [symptoms] and
pneumonia in poultry, can wipe out entire flocks in a very short time, and
chickens need to be vaccinated against it.
Dr Nyika said they were awaiting delivery of the Newcastle vaccine they had
ordered and would move into the affected areas as soon as the consignment
arrived.
In July 2004, the disease wiped out a flock at a farm in Harare's Vainona area.

[Newcastle disease (NCD) is endemic in Zimbabwe; the last officially
reported outbreak occurred during April 2004 in Matabeleland North.
Clinical and postmortem-based diagnosis of NCD should be
laboratory-confirmed to exclude other possible diseases, particularly
highly pathogenic avian influenza. - Mod.AS]
