71 percent of ducks in southern Viet Nam infected with bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
Initial testing has shown that 71 percent of ducks and 21.4 percent
of chickens in Viet Nam's 11 southern localities in the Mekong Delta
are infected with bird flu virus strain H5.
Up to 80 percent of 2000 samples taken from ducks raised in Can Tho
city alone, which is home to some 1.5 million poultry, tested
positive to H5, local newspaper Youth on Wednesday [13 Apr 2005]
quoted recent tests by the country's Regional Veterinary Center as
saying. The situation poses challenges to many localities, because a
great number of ducks are raised freely in fields and canals in the
delta, which practice can spread the disease from province to
province. Moreover, many local farmers protest the forced culling,
saying that their ducks are totally healthy and not yet confirmed as
having contracted the deadly virus H5N1.
On 1 Apr 2005, Viet Nam started a month-long campaign to clean up
poultry farms nationwide in a move to stamp out bird flu, which has
hit 35 cities and provinces nationwide since January 2005. 33
localities have so far detected no new affected spots in their
territory for 3 weeks, meeting the country's criteria to announce an
end to the disease.
Viet Nam has reported 35 human cases of bird flu infection since
December 2004, of whom 16 have died. To minimize the risk of
infection, it has intensified publicity, urging local people not to
eat dishes made from raw duck blood or to slaughter sick poultry for
food and to avoid coming into contact with fowl without wearing
protective gear.

[The role of ducks as reservoir of infection in Eastern Asia has been
addressed during the recent FAO/OIE consultation, which concluded
that the possibility of vaccinating ducks should be explored.
Experimentally, vaccines have been shown to significantly reduce AI
virus replication and shedding in domestic ducks and geese and thus
decrease environmental contamination (especially in ponds, lakes and
rivers) and prevent contact transmission.
It seems that a Vietnamese debate between supporters of stamping-out
policy and proponents of vaccination against avian influenza is going
on. While the above newswire describes "a month-long campaign to
clean up poultry farms nationwide, in a move to stamp out bird flu,"
a previous posting (20050312.0730) reported a decision by Viet Nam's
Animal Health Department under the Ministry of Agriculture, to start
-- in Apr 2005 -- vaccination of duck flocks in the Mekong Delta. One
possibility is that different control strategies might be adopted in
relation to chickens and ducks, respectively. Clarification might
help. - Mod.AS]
