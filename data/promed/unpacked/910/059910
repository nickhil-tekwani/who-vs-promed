Can a virus such as hantavirus be recovered from human bones and other
organic materials that are hundreds of years old?

[I'm 62 years old and so far no one has recovered a hantavirus from me.
Assuming you mean can a hantavirus be isolated from archaeological
materials from humans, the answer is "no".
Hantaviruses are RNA viruses and RNA is notoriously unstable over time.
When the 1993 Four Corners epidemic of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
occurred, I wondered whether that might have been the reason the Anasazi
left there so suddenly in the 1300s. Subsequently, while hiking at an
archaeological site called Keet Seel, in northern Arizona, I was sifting
some dirt and found a thigh bone of what appeared to be a rodent. Given
that the Anasazi stored much of their food near their residences, it was
reasonable to assume that rodents shared their living quarters and might
have shared their viruses as well. Nonetheless, Stu Nichol, CDC/Atlanta,
told me there was virtually no chance that viral RNA could be detected from
such specimens.
About two years ago I posted a very long message about hantaviruses on a
bulletin boards for archaeologists. They continue to be concerned about
acquiring a hantavirus infection from their digs but thus far none has been
recorded. - Mod.CHC]
