As of 29 Apr 2008, a total of 1884 cases including 20 deaths of hand,
foot and mouth disease (HFMD) due to enterovirus 71 (EV-71) have been
reported among infants and young children. The 20 deaths are in
Fuyang city in Anhui Province, China.

All fatal cases died of serious complications such as neurogenic
pulmonary edema due to EV-71 infection. The overall case fatality
rate has decreased from 11 percent during 10-31 Mar 2008 to 0.2
percent during 17-29 Apr 2008. The number of hospitalised cases has
gradually increased since the end of March 2008 with a sharp increase
in the number of cases since 19 Apr 2008.

Public health experts predict that the number of cases will continue
to increase and will peak around June-July 2008. Retrospective case
investigation has revealed that sporadic cases had occurred since the
beginning of March [2008]. Cases have been reported from all over
Fuyang city.

Testing for a variety of respiratory diseases of the initial cases
did not reveal any conclusive results. Subsequently, additional
testing and several expert consultations were conducted at the
national level. On 23 Apr 2008, EV-71 was confirmed. Health
authorities informed WHO and Hong Kong SAR Department of Health and
the Province of Taiwan's Department of Health immediately on these
results.

Chinese health authorities have put in place targeted prevention and
control measures in Fuyang city and Anhui Province, including
enhanced surveillance, training of health care workers at all levels
in treatment, prevention and control, strengthening of environmental
health management, and the supervision and monitoring of drinking
water quality. A public awareness campaign is ongoing, stressing the
need for good personal hygiene, mostly by hand washing.

Non-polio enteroviruses are common and distributed worldwide.
Although infection often has no symptoms and goes unnoticed, these
viruses are also associated with occasional outbreaks in which a
larger-than-usual number of patients develop clinical disease,
sometimes with fatal consequences. No specific anti-viral therapy is
available, and treatment focuses on prevention of complications. As
there is no vaccine for this virus, control measures during outbreaks
are focused on classical hygiene measures including frequent hand
washing and disinfection of soiled clothing and surfaces. In certain
situations, it may be advisable to close child-care facilities and
schools to reduce the intensity of transmission. It is not necessary
to restrict travel or trade.

Currently, many countries in the Western Pacific region have
implemented heightened surveillance for hand, foot and mouth disease
and for severe complications in children.
