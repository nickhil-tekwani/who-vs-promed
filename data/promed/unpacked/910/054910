The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) announced today [25 Apr 2022] that it has learned of 3 suspected cases of severe hepatitis in children under 10 years of age, potentially linked to a strain of adenovirus. Two of the cases are in suburban Chicago and one is in Western Illinois. One case resulted in a liver transplant. IDPH is working to learn of other suspected cases in Illinois and is asking healthcare providers in the state to be on the lookout for symptoms and to report any suspected cases of hepatitis in children of unknown origin to local public health authorities.

The IDPH announcement follows a nationwide alert issued by the CDC in response to a cluster of 9 cases of hepatitis of unknown origin in children in Alabama ranging in age from one to 6 years old, all of whom were previously healthy.

The CDC said that symptoms of hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, light-colored stools, joint pain, and jaundice and can be caused by viruses. These cases appear to have an association with adenovirus 41. Adenoviruses spread from person to person and most commonly cause respiratory illness, but depending on the type, can also cause other illnesses such as gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach or intestines), conjunctivitis (pink eye), and cystitis (bladder infection). Adenovirus type 41 typically presents as diarrhea, vomiting, and fever and is often accompanied by respiratory symptoms. While there have been case reports of hepatitis in immunocompromised children with adenovirus infection, adenovirus type 41 is not known to be a cause of hepatitis in otherwise healthy children.

CDC said it is working with state health departments to see if there are additional American cases, and what may be causing these cases. At this time, CDC said it believes adenovirus may be the cause for these reported cases, but investigators are still learning more, including ruling out other possible causes and identifying other possible contributing factors.

CDC is asking physicians to consider adenovirus testing using PCR or NAAT on respiratory samples, stool or rectal swabs, and whole blood for pediatric patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology, and to report any possible cases of hepatitis of unknown origin to CDC and state public health authorities. In addition, CDC is encouraging parents and caregivers to be aware of the symptoms of hepatitis and to contact their healthcare provider with any concerns. CDC continues to recommend children be up to date on all their vaccinations, and that parents and caregivers of young children take the same everyday preventive actions that it recommends for everyone, including washing hands often, avoiding people who are sick, covering coughs and sneezes, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.

The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services confirmed to ABC11 on Monday [25 Apr 2022] that 2 school-aged children tested positive for hepatitis. The agency said it was made aware of the cases in March 2022, and both were severe.

In an email to ABC11, NCDHHS communications specialist Bailey Pennington wrote, "No cause has been found, and no common exposures were identified. Neither child tested positive for adenovirus. NCDHHS has notified clinicians of the recent CDC health advisory on this issue and is conducting ongoing surveillance for potential cases in coordination with NC Poison Control and with epidemiologists in the state's largest healthcare systems."

The agency did not specify where the children lived. However, ABC11 was able to independently confirm neither child lives in the ABC11 viewing area.

"It may not happen again," said UNC Health pediatric gastroenterologist Dr. Steven Lichtman. "But it's very rare that we'd have 2 or 3 acute liver failure patients in the hospital at one time." Lichtman said both children ended up on a liver transplant list, which caught the attention of pediatricians across the region. "It is an odd coincidence. I mean, it doesn't make any sense," he said.

The best line of defense, said Lichtman, is washing your hands, which you would normally do to prevent the spread of illness. Whether or not the illnesses are coincidences or the start of something much larger still remains to be seen. "I think both answers are right. I mean, we'll know in the near future if this is the beginning stage now," said Lichtman. "So is this going to be it for all of North Carolina, or are they going to start showing up more? That would be pretty shocking. And then, like you said, would it be the beginning of something, but right now...we don't think so. But nothing. We don't understand it perfectly, to be honest."

Experts also ruled out the possibility of toxic water in the area where both patients live.

[It is not stated in the Illinois post when the cases occurred and if and how the cases were tested for adenovirus. The 2 North Carolina cases were previously mentioned, but the post from today elaborates more on these cases and reports that they were diagnosed in March 2022. Neither case was positive for adenovirus, but what was tested and the testing method was not mentioned.

More cases are likely to be found now that public health officials in the USA and Europe have made announcements about this clinical entity. Whether the adenovirus serotype 41 is shown to be the cause, alone or with a co-factor, is yet to be clarified. Additionally, since the case definition requires the illness to be severe, it remains possible that many more milder cases have occurred beneath the radar. - Mod.LL
