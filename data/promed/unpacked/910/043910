The FDA says that there are 20 sickened as the Jules cashew brie _Salmonella_ outbreak ends. This is a huge increase from the 7 illnesses that were reported in the last update on 7 May 2021. Five people have been hospitalized. Cashew brie is a vegan alternative to the dairy product. It is typically made with raw cashews.

The case count by state is as follows: California (15), Florida (2), Maryland (1), Tennessee (2). The FDA does not give out any information about patient age ranges or illness onset dates.

All varieties of Jule's Foods products were recalled on 22 Apr 2021 because of this outbreak. The recall included 3 varieties of the cashew brie, an artichoke spinach dip, and vegan ranch dressing. These items were distributed to independently owned grocery stores in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Texas.

Originally, there were 2 serotypes of _Salmonella_ identified in this outbreak: _Salmonella_ Duisburg and _Salmonella_ Urbana. Two other strains, _Salmonella_ Typhimurium and _Salmonella_ Chester, are also linked to this outbreak, according to this new update. Illnesses caused by _Salmonella_ Chester have the same genetic fingerprint as _Salmonella_ found in a sample of Jule's Cashew Brie that was collected by the California Department of Public Health. Other strains were found in the raw and finished product samples but have not been linked to any illnesses.

Based on FDA traceback investigation and sample results, the cashews used by Jule's Foods have been identified as the likely source of contamination. The FDA worked with the cashew supplier to make sure that these nuts were removed from the market and that corrective actions were implemented.

This outbreak is over as of 7 Jul 2021. There are no more recommendations about recalls or advisories for consumers, restaurants, or retailers.

Symptoms of a _Salmonella_ infection include a fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, abdominal pain and cramps, and diarrhea that can be bloody. People usually get sick 6-72 hours after they eat food contaminated with this pathogen. While most people do recover without medical care, some get sick enough to be hospitalized.

If you have eaten the recalled products and have been sick with those symptoms, see your doctor.
