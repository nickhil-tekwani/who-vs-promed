About 250 000 birds are to be culled at a poultry farm in south
Russia's Krasnodar Territory following an outbreak of bird flu
earlier this month [September 2007], Russia's agriculture watchdog
said Wednesday [26 Sep 2007].
A total of 170 600 birds have been slaughtered at the Lebyazh
Chepiginskoye farm and the remaining 77 500 are due to be culled in
the near future, Alexander Skorikov, the head of the animal health
department at Russia's agriculture watchdog said.
On 5 Sep 2007, about 22 000 birds were culled at the farm after a
regional laboratory identified the lethal H5N1 virus in dead birds at the farm.
In 2005, 1.3 million birds were culled in Russia, in 2006 the figure
stood at 1.04 million, but this year [2007] the figure had dropped to
around 260 000.
Krasnodar Territory is on the route taken by migrating birds in
winter and is subject to a higher risk of bird flu as a result,
although, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), most of
the spread is through poultry and the poultry trade.
Since late 2003, according to the World Health Organization, when the
virus 1st hit Asia, the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has killed at
least 191 people out of 317 known cases.
No human deaths from bird flu have been recorded in Russia.

[2] Russia: envisaged wild bird vaccine

Russia could develop a bird flu vaccine targeted at wild birds within
2 years, creating a revolution in the flight against the disease, the
chief vet at Russia's food safety watchdog said Tuesday [25 Sep 2007].
"It will, speaking mildly, be a revolution, because no one has ever
tried to control the spread of the flu virus among wild birds. And
this is the source of all the trouble," Nikolai Vlasov said.
Bird flu has never really disappeared from Russia since 2005, Vlasov
told journalists, adding that, out of 100 birds that are culled,
around 2-80 will actually have been infected depending on the location.
According to watchdog estimates, by the end of the year [2007], the
numbers of birds which will die from bird flu outbreaks in Russia
will be 4 times lower than last year's [2006] figure.

Over 4500 fowls were culled on Tuesday night [25 Sep 2007] after
detection of avian influenza virus at a poultry farm of Lahoripara
union in Bogra [Rajshahi Division].
Hasan Shamim Iqbal, officer-in-charge (OC) of Bogra Sadar Police
Station, said 4683 fowls were buried in presence of a magistrate.
[The poultry farm owner] told journalists that after the death of
1317 fowls, he took samples to Jaypurhat Veterinary Research Centre
for lab test on 22 Sep 2007. After the test, it was confirmed that
those were affected by avian influenza (type H5). They also referred
to Bangladesh Veterinary Research Centre at Savar for the final test.
The experts at the Dhaka centre sent a fax to Nakul on Tuesday night
[25 Sep 2007] asking him to cull the fowls.
A 3-member team led by Dr Abdul Baki, chief scientific officer of the
centre, visited the area.
District Livestock Resources officer Qauzi Shahadat Hossain said the
farm was sealed off and 1-km (0.6 mi) area around it had been
