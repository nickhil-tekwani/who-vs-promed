The Osun State Police Command says at least 3 people have been confirmed dead in Ede area of the state after contracting cholera.

The spokesperson of the force, SP Yemisi Opalola, who disclosed this to reporters on Tuesday [23 Mar 2021] in Oshogbo, also denied rumors that they were killed by food poisoning. She said there was no truth in the allegation that the food was poisoned by some people, all beggars, in the Oke-Gada area of Ede. SP Yemisi said a preliminary police investigation revealed that they had died of cholera.

"The Divisional Police Officer in Ede visited the Seriki of Hausa in the community over the incident, because they did not report the matter to the police. The Seriki informed him that it was a cholera outbreak and not food poisoning. Three people have died, while 3 others are in hospital. We are investigating the matter." she said.

But the spokeswoman said they would continue to investigate the matter. The state Health Commissioner, Rafiu Isamotu, who also confirmed the incident, said: "The government has taken samples of those hospitalized and those that have died to know the cause of the incident."

[2] Cholera: Cameroon (Douala)

At least one person has died from cholera outbreak and 10 others are infected in Cameroon's commercial hub of Douala, local health officials said on Tuesday [23 Mar 2021]. The outbreak has affected Manoka, Mbange and New Bell neighbourhoods of the city, said James Longsi, a public health official. "The unhygienic living conditions, ignorance about the spread of the disease are the main reasons for the resurgence of the epidemic," Longsi told reporters during a launch of a vaccination campaign against the epidemic in Douala.

The campaign, intended to keep children and women safe from the epidemic, will run until 30 Mar 2021. "We are vaccinating as from one year old upward, including pregnant women. Vaccination teams will go from door to door," said Nangha Awabeng, head of a local district hospital.

Officials said in 2020 over 200 cases were detected in the city.

[3] Cholera: Somalia
Date: Tue 23 Mar 2021

The Ministry of Health of Somalia has announced 68 new suspected cases of cholera, with no reported deaths, for epidemiological week 10 (1-7 Mar 2021). In week 10, all cases were reported from Banadir, Bay and Lower Shabelle regions. The cumulative total number of suspected cholera cases in 2021 is 780, including 2 associated deaths with a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 0.3%. All of the cases were reported from 17 districts in Banadir region; Merka and Afgoye districts in Lower Shabelle region; and Baidoa district in Bay region.

Of the 780 cases reported from Somalia since the week 1, 284 (36%) are aged 2 years or younger. Of the 2 deaths registered, one (50%) was aged 2 years or younger.

The current cholera outbreak started in December 2017 following floods that affected districts in the basins of Jubba and Shabelle rivers. It was contained in 5 of the 6 regions, while active transmission has continued to be reported from Banadir. Flash floods caused by heavy Gu rains in April 2020 led to the contamination of water sources that led to an increase in the number of cholera cases. In 2021, a cumulative attack rate of 26 persons per 100 000 populations was reported. The highest attack rate was reporting from the districts of Danyile (1207 per 100 000 population), Madina (69 per 100 000 population), and Dharkenly (47 per 100 000 population). The majority of the deaths have been reported in Banadir. The overall CFR is 0.3%.

Of the 216 stool samples tested since January 2021, a total of 65 (30%) samples came out positive for _Vibrio cholerae_. Serotype Ogawa was isolated from stool samples collected from Banadir. This strain is sensitive to tetracycline, chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin.

The overall reduction in the number of new cholera cases as compared to the numbers at the beginning of the outbreak is attributed to improved implementation of preventive interventions, including oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaigns and the strengthening of water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) activities in hot spots. However, the current floods and cholera outbreak occurred at a time when COVID-19 cases are increasing in all regions of Somalia, stretching the already limited capacity to respond to the cholera alerts.

WHO continues to provide leadership and support to health authorities and partners in implementing activities that can mitigate the outbreak. Disease surveillance is being managed with the support of WHO through an electronic system known as the Early Warning Alert and Response Network (EWARN) and is currently being expanded to all health facilities across the country. WHO and the Ministry of Health continue to monitor outbreak trends through EWARN and promptly investigate and respond to all alerts.

[Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J, eds. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp. 113-136:

"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2- or 3-dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80% for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.

"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:
- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;
- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65% (95% CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;
- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).

"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single-dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single-dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64)."
