A Citrus County resident has died from a _Vibrio vulnificus_ saltwater bacterial infection, according to the Florida Department of Health.

The state keeps track of the number of persons who are diagnosed with _V. vulnificus_ infections and those who die as a result of the infection. The state does not release the names of those who are diagnosed with _V. vulnificus_ because of health privacy laws.

So far in 2016, 4 people in Florida have died from _V. vulnificus_. Those who died were from Citrus, Broward, Palm Beach and Santa Rosa counties.

According to the Florida Department of Health, _Vibrio vulnificus_ is a naturally occurring bacterium found in warm, brackish water. The health department says persons with fresh cuts or scrapes should not enter the water. People who are immuno-compromised, those with chronic liver disease, kidney disease, or weakened immune systems should wear proper foot protection to prevent cuts and injury caused by rocks and shells on the beach. There are other ways people can become infected with _V. vulnificus_, including eating certain foods.

Here's a historical look at the number of cases and deaths in Florida since 2008:
2008: 16 cases, 6 deaths
2009: 24 cases, 7 deaths
2010: 32 cases, 10 deaths
2011: 35 cases, 13 deaths
2012: 26 cases, 9 deaths
2013: 41 cases, 12 deaths
2014: 32 cases, 7 deaths
2015: 45 cases, 14 deaths

[There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can include more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL
