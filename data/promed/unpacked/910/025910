Ackee kills 23 in Jamaica in less than 3 months
-----------------------------------------------
With 23 confirmed deaths and 194 suspected cases of ackee poisoning
in less than 3 months, government chemists are now conducting
intensive testing on the fruit to determine the reason for the
unusually high number of fatalities linked to it.

Speaking at a press conference at the Health Ministry's head office
in downtown Kingston Tuesday, Director of Health Promotion and
Protection Dr Eva Lewis-Fuller said that while the cases were
initially being reported in St Mary and St Ann, the ministry has since
received reports from other parishes as well.

"At this time, all parishes are involved in the outbreak, mainly
parishes of the north-east region and some parishes of the west," she
said.

"We have been investigating this, because there has been some unusual
characteristics of this outbreak. It is not following the pattern that
we are used to in the old days when we have ackee poison, when it
affected mainly child[ren] over 5 and it was evenly distributed
between men and women," Lewis-Fuller added.

Dr Lewis-Fuller said that men accounted for 60 per cent of those
cases reported to the ministry -- the majority of them being between
the ages of 25-44. The last [or the latest?] confirmed death was that
of a 52-year-old man from St Mary on 10 Feb 2011 at the Port Maria
Hospital.

Tuesday [22 Feb 2011], the ministry said that it is no closer to
finding out the reason for the increase in ackee poisoning, but has
been cautioning persons -- through advertisements -- about the proper
preparation of the fruit as well as warning against forcefully opening
the ackee pods.

"We do have some theories and hypotheses," said Dr Lewis-Fuller. "We
had very cold weather during December and there are theories
surrounding the delayed opening of the ackee and, therefore, persons
might have been stimulated to do their own thing with opening the
ackee."

Ackee contains hypoglycin, which is known for lowering the blood
sugar to lethal levels. Symptoms of ackee poisoning include
uncontrollable vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, and drowsiness.
The ministry has assured that there has been no suspected case of
ackee poisoning in countries where the fruit has been exported. They
believe this is due to the fact that ackee prepared for export is
tested for hypoglycin. In the meanwhile, Chief Medical Officer at the
Ministry Dr Sheila Campbell-Forrester said ackee poisoning has now
been upgraded to the status of a reportable condition, although there
has been a tapering off of reported cases in the past few weeks.

"Ackee poisoning was really not a reportable disease and so we may
have been having cases of ackee poisoning in the past, which were not
been reported or recorded or may have been missed [or] thought to be
gastroenteritis," she said.
