Poultry vaccination planned
---------------------------
Duck flocks in the Mekong Delta will be vaccinated against bird flu next
month [April 2005], according to the Animal Health Department under the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
The recent inoculation of chicken in the northern province of Ha Tay has
shown "encouraging" results, the department announced.
Animal health officials also planned to continue using bird flu vaccines
made in China and the Netherlands for this inoculation, it added.

[Applying AI vaccination in Viet Nam is a significant change in the
country's official control policy. The last follow-up report of 28 Feb 2005
specified the following measures: control of arthropods; control of
wildlife reservoirs; quarantine; movement control inside the
country; stamping-out policy; screening.
The recent FAO/OIE conference in Viet Nam concluded: "with the success of
vaccination in preventing and controlling the disease in the past year in
several countries and regions, the meeting agreed that vaccines can be a
strong weapon in the fight against the disease in poultry, and the
possibility of vaccinating ducks should be explored. But further study is
needed on the conditions in which vaccines can be delivered with minimum
risk to human health".
So far, only 2 Eastern-Asia countries, namely China and Indonesia,
officially allow AI vaccination. Thailand indicated in Dec 2004 the
planning of field vaccination trials. - Mod.AS]

No new bird flu outbreaks in 22 localities in 3 weeks
---------------------------------------------------------
No new bird flu outbreaks have been reported by 22 out of the 35 bird
flu-infected provinces and cities across the country, for at least 3
consecutive weeks, the Veterinary Department announced on 11 Mar 2005.
The newest localities joining the list were the southernmost province of Ca
Mau and the Mekong delta province of Soc Trang.

[Based upon the said statement, it may be deduced that there are currently
about 13 "localities" in Viet Nam where HPAI cases have been confirmed in
avians during the last 3 weeks.
Viet Nam's last follow-up report to the OIE, received 28 Feb 2005, named 21
locations with new HPAI outbreaks -- including Ca Mau and Soc Trang.
According to Viet Nam's official terminology, "locations" and "localities"
stand for provinces or cities. A new, updated follow-up report could make
the situation clearer.
An Update On Avian Influenza In Animals In Asia (Type H5), as of 11 Mar
2005, is available at
<http://oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/A_AI-Asia.htm>. It includes the
weekly follow-up report (No 48) of Thailand, as well as the follow-up
report No 7 of Indonesia. The previous Indonesian report dates back to 6
Oct 2004.
The said update includes a graph showing the total cumulative numbers of
reported HPAI outbreaks since the beginning of the panzootic in Dec 2003.
The 3 leading countries are Viet Nam (1837 outbreaks), Thailand (1088) and
China (50). - Mod.AS]
