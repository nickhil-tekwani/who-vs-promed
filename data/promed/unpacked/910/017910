1. Equine influenza; situation update, 16 Apr 2002
-----------------------------------------------
No new cases have been confirmed since 10 Apr 2003.
2. An overview, 11 Apr 2003:
----------------------------
Equine influenza has been confirmed to date in 14 flat race training
yards since 13 Mar 2003. Consistent with previous influenza outbreaks
among thoroughbred racehorses that have been vaccinated against the
viral infection, clinical signs in the current outbreak have been
characteristically rapid in their spread around affected yards.
However, signs have been relatively mild compared with infections
among non-vaccinated horses. Signs in the current outbreak have
included acute coughing, mainly at exercise, with some horses
developing a nasal discharge. Fever has been seen but is not a
consistent sign. An unusual feature of the current outbreaks is that,
in most affected yards, the first horses to develop disease have been
3-year-olds or older horses.
The Animal Health Trust, with full cooperation from the yards' vets,
has been conducting detailed epidemiological and virological
investigations of the outbreak. The information obtained from these
investigations is vital to ensure that any strain variation is
monitored and allowed for in future vaccine updates. Therefore, this
service is being provided to the trainers at no cost. The virus
isolated from the earliest cases has already been characterised and
is closely related to a virus that was isolated in Lexington,
Kentucky, USA in the autumn of 2002. It is not yet clear why the
disease has been seen in well-vaccinated racehorses, and this is of
particular interest to the scientists at the Animal Health Trust, so
that they may make recommendations to improve protection from
vaccination in the future.
Scientists at the Trust are working closely with vaccine
manufacturers and human influenza experts in order to expedite their
investigations into the reason for this outbreak. In the meantime,
they are advising trainers around the country to consider a
re-vaccination (booster) programme, in consultation with their own
veterinary surgeons. It is known that antibody levels decline
steadily following vaccination, and it is anticipated that 'topping
them up' in this way will increase the level of immunity, even though
it cannot guarantee full protection.
