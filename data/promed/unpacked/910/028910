Cases of imported cholera in the Czech Republic
-----------------------------------------------
No case of cholera has been notified since 1986 in the Czech Republic.
Recently, however, we have confirmed 2 strains of _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 from
2 unrelated cases of cholera imported into the country. Both patients are
in good condition after receiving treatment. No contacts tested positive.
The first strain was isolated from rectal smears from a 24 year old man who
was admitted to hospital in Pardubice (eastern Bohemia) with clinical
symptoms of cholera after returning from India. The strain was referred to
the laboratory at the Centre of Epidemiology and Microbiology at the
National Institute of Public Health in Prague. It was confirmed as _Vibrio
cholerae_ O1 serotype Ogawa the same day (20 Feb 2002). Subsequently the
strain was shown to be biotype El Tor, and reversed passive latex
agglutination was used to confirm the production of cholera enterotoxin (CT).
The second strain was isolated from a stool specimen from a 29 year old man
from Klatovy (southern Bohemia). He had spent several days trekking in
northern Thailand. The strain was confirmed on 13 Mar 2002 as _Vibrio
cholerae_ O1, biotype El Tor. The serotype was confirmed to be Inaba; the
production of enterotoxin was not confirmed.

[Mod. JW usually writes a comment at this point that Thailand does not
officially report cholera to the World Health Organization (WHO). Checking
the WHO reports on cholera
<http://www.who.int/emc/diseases/cholera/choltbl2000.html> as of the year
2000, Thailand was still not reporting cholera cases and deaths officially
to WHO (they are not listed in reporting countries for the year). In
attempting to check the Thai MOH website -- using the Yahoo country
government search engine -- there is a link to the Thai communicable
disease website, which says [in English: "General Communicable Disease
Division - resource for information on cholera, hepatitis A, measles,
ascariasis, anthrax, and more. Also includes immunization requirement for
children and women during pregnancy. In Thai." This suggests that they do
recognize cholera as a problem. Unfortunately the only English info is
general background on the General Communicable Disease Division, and not
the diseases mentioned in the summary. Official information on the status
of cholera in Thailand and the current circulating serotypes would be very
much appreciated. - Mod.MPP
