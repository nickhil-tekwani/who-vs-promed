Since the preceding West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance report of Fri 8 Jun
2001, 2 more WNV-positive birds have been reported; one each in the states
of Maryland and New York. In addition 2 birds in Rhode Island were omitted
inadvertently from the previous report. The tally of WNV-positive birds is
now: New Jersey 12, Maryland 3, New York 2, Rhode Island 2, and Connecticut
1. So far the only report of West Nile virus-positive mosquitoes has come
from New Jersey. - Mod.CP

Update on the Status of West Nile Virus Surveillance Mapping for 2001
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The National Atlas of the United States of America will not be producing
West Nile maps in 2001, however, another component of the U. S. Geological
Survey (USGS), the Center for Integration of Natural Disaster Information
(CINDI), will be producing West Nile virus surveillance maps for 2001.
The USGS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are
collaborating to produce web-based maps illustrating the results of the
2001 West Nile virus surveillance activity. The USGS Center for Integration
of Natural Disaster Information (CINDI) will produce county-level summary
maps showing the results for 5 categories of surveillance: avian mortality,
mosquito trapping, sentinel species, veterinary, and human. The maps will
be produced on a weekly basis, although more frequent updates may be
performed if conditions warrant. These maps replace the similar products
produced by the National Atlas of the United States of America last year.
CDC expects the WNV reporting system to begin functioning during the week
beginning 18 Jun 2001. Maps created from that data will be available soon
thereafter.
The maps and graphs reflect the data reported to the CDC by state and local
health officials. The maps can be found at the following web address:
<http://cindi.usgs.gov/hazard/event/west_nile/west_nile.html>
Alternatively, users can go to the CINDI home page (cindi.usgs.gov) and

No New West Nile virus-positive Results
---------------------------------------
As of 13 Jun 200, there have been no new confirmations of West Nile virus
anywhere in the State of Connecticut. A crow reported in Milford on 23 May
2001 is the only positive test result to date. The City of East Hartford
has decided to reduce nuisance mosquito populations by spraying an
adulticide. There is no threat or presence of West Nile virus in East
Hartford at this time. The decision to spray was made locally by East
Hartford officials and is not related to the State Mosquito Management Program.
During the first 5 weeks of reporting, 561 dead bird sightings were
reported to local health departments, including 222 crows. As of 13 Jun
2001, birds were submitted for testing from 49 towns, 57 birds are still in
process, testing has been completed on 51 birds. A crow from Milford
(reported on May 23, 2001) was confirmed positive for WNV. Mosquito traps
were placed in Milford in response to the positive crow, 84 mosquitoes were
collected and are negative for WNV. There are no cases of WNV reported for
humans or domestic animals and poultry.

West Nile Virus Confirmed in Third Crow in Baltimore, Maryland
--------------------------------------------------------------
This morning Tue 12 Jun 2001, The Washington Times print edition is
reporting (Section C, Page 1) that West Nile virus has been found again in
a third crow in Baltimore, the largest city in Maryland. Two other dead
crows tested positive for the virus last month. Health officials are
concerned that the infected birds have been found so early in the year. The
first crow was a young one, leading health experts to speculate that the
virus is over-wintering in local mosquito populations. However, the virus
has not so far been found in any of the thousands of mosquitoes from local
ponds that have been tested. Health officials say they expect the virus to
spread this year, among people as well as among birds.

West Nile Virus-positive Crow Count Remains at 12
-------------------------------------------------
Human and equine testing has begun.
Crow, Hawk & Falcon Testing:
To date, 176 crows and one hawk have been tested by the Department of
Health and Senior Services' Public Health and Environmental Laboratory. Of
those tested, 12 crows found in Bergen (1), Middlesex (10) and Monmouth (1)
Counties have been confirmed positive for the presence of the West Nile
virus (WNV).
Mosquito Testing:
To date, 2 mosquito pools collected in Middlesex County have tested
positive for the presence of WNV. A mosquito pool collected 31 May 2001 in
Piscataway has tested positive for the presence of WNV. In total 389
mosquito pools have been tested.
Human Testing:
In total, blood and/or spinal fluid samples from 6 residents have been or
are in the process of being tested for the presence of WNV. Samples from a
Morris County resident tested in New York State were negative and results
are pending on residents from Burlington, Hudson, Mercer, Monmouth and
Ocean Counties. These individuals either had symptoms or signs that met the
established WNV testing criteria or exhibited most of the symptoms and are
from counties where dead crows and/or mosquitoes with the virus have been
discovered.
Horse Testing:
A total of 8 horses have been tested for WNV this season and all are
negative. Equine testing is conducted by the New Jersey Department of
Agriculture's animal health laboratory in Trenton and positive results are
sent to the National Veterinary Services Lab (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa for
confirmation.
