Food bug outbreak tops 100 cases
--------------------------------
More than 100 people have now been struck down by a salmonella bug in North
East Lincolnshire. Environmental health officials are still trying to
pinpoint the exact source of the outbreak 2 weeks after the 1st cases were
confirmed. They now believe the bacteria are being carried in salads at
takeaway outlets. Environmental health manager Steve Mercer said: "We have
every available member of the team tracking back through the entire supply
chain."
Of the 106 confirmed cases so far, 5 required hospital treatment, but all
of those have now been discharged. "This outbreak has extended much longer
than normal," said Mr Mercer. "It has spread across most of North East
Lincolnshire, and our team has been working pretty much round the clock to
track down the source."
Although most of the cases stemmed from just 2 fast food outlets, others
had been reported at "a dozen or more" takeways throughout the area. The
relatively rare Newport strain of salmonellosis is involved in the
outbreak, and Mr Mercer said a few other cases had been reported from
around the country, as well as in Grimsby and Cleethorpes.
There are normally only about 150 cases of the strain reported throughout
the UK every year.

[_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Newport (_S._ Newport) has recently been
named an emerging disease by the American Association of Veterinary
Laboratory Diagnosticians (AAVLD). Salmonellosis, due to any of 2200
_Salmonella_ serotypes (serovars), is one of the few cattle diseases that
is increasing in prevalence. While most serotypes are potential human and
animal pathogens, only 10 serotypes are responsible for most disease in
cattle. The National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) listed _S.
Newport_ as one of the top 10 most frequently identified _Salmonella_
serotypes from USA cattle from July 1998 through June 1999. Cull (market)
dairy cows account for a large amount of beef, especially ground beef. Of
58 serotypes isolated by culture from culled dairy cows in 5 regional
market cow establishments in the USA, _S. Newport_ was among the 30
commonest serotypes.
This serotype of salmonellosis causes significant clinical disease in
livestock, particularly cattle, in humans, and in other animal species.
Multiple antimicrobial-resistant strains have been recorded in the US and
Canada. All of these strains are resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol,
streptomycin, sulphonamides, and tetracycline (ACSSuT). In addition, many
of these strains show intermediate or full resistance to third-generation
cephalosporins, kanamycin, potentiated sulphonamides, and gentamicin.
With this strong association with cattle and dairy products, perhaps cheese
in the "takeaway" salads is the culprit here. - Mod.LL]
