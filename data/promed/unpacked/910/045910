[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections as they are reported. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. Another complication is delayed reporting of cases which occurred during this period. - Mod.MPP]

In the period 27 Feb 2018 - 5 Mar 2015 there have been a total of 4 newly confirmed cases, 2 fatalities and 4 recoveries reported by the Saudi MOH. In addition, there were delayed reports for 25-26 Feb 2018 which included 4 new cases and one recovery.

[3] EMRO Sit Rep January 2018
Date: Tue 20 Feb 2018
Source: WHO, Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO), Epidemic and pandemic-prone diseases [edited]
http://www.emro.who.int/pandemic-epidemic-diseases/mers-cov/mers-situation-update-january-2018.html


Situation update on Middle East respiratory syndrome January 2018
-----------------------------------------------------------------
At the end of January 2018, a total of 2160 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), including 773 associated deaths (case-fatality rate: 35.8 percent) were reported globally; the majority of these cases were reported from Saudi Arabia (1786 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 699 related deaths with a case-fatality rate of 39.1 percent).

During the month of January [2018], 25 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS were reported in Saudi Arabia including 8 associated deaths. A nosocomial outbreak of MERS occurred in a private hospital in Hafr Albatin region [Eastern province/Ash Sharqīyah)], the date of onset of the 1st case was [23 Jan 2018]; while on [4 Feb 2018], 3 asymptomatic healthcare workers were reported through contact tracing.

The demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the cases reported in January 2018 do not show any significant difference compared with cases reported during the same period from 2012 to 2017. Owing to improved infection prevention and control practices in the hospitals, the number of hospital-acquired cases of MERS has dropped significantly in 2015, 2016 and 2017 compared to previous years.

The age group of those aged 50-59 years continues to be the group at highest risk for acquiring infection as primary cases. For secondary cases, it is the age group of 30-39 years who are mostly at risk. The number of deaths is higher in the age group of 50-59 years for primary cases and 70-79 years for secondary cases.

[Take away points from the information in the above update sections:
February and early March have been active periods for MERS-CoV transmission. During this period there have been 2 clusters of nosocomial transmission with 3 asymptomatic cases among healthcare workers detected during contact tracing reported in Hafr-al-Batin (Eastern region), and a currently ongoing outbreak of nosocomial transmission in Riyadh, with 4 reported cases involving 3 patients and one healthcare worker.

Summarizing the information available:
Since the beginning of 2018 there have been a total of 47 newly confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia.
During the month of January 2018 there were a total of 24 newly confirmed cases, 14 fatalities and 5 recoveries reported.
During the month of February 2018, there were a total of 19 newly confirmed cases, 2 fatalities and 12 recoveries reported.
During the 1st 5 days of the month of March 2018, there were a total of 4 newly confirmed cases, 2 fatalities and 4 recoveries reported.

Of the 47 cases where information was available, there were a total of 25 cases classified as primary cases where high risk exposure histories were still under investigation, 12 cases classified as primary cases with history of either direct or indirect exposure to camels were reported, and 8 cases classified as secondary healthcare acquired cases. There were 5 cases reported in healthcare workers. Geographically there were cases reported from Riyadh region (21 cases), Ash Sharqīyah/Eastern region (5 cases), Najran region (4 cases) Hail region (3 cases), Al Qaṣīm region (3 cases), Al Ḥudūd ash Shamāliyah/Northern Borders region (2 cases), `Asīr region (2 cases), Al Jawf region (2 cases),
Tabūk region (2 cases), Makkah region (2 cases), and Al Madinah region (1 case).

During this period there has been delayed and incomplete reporting with a number of cases not being reported as newly confirmed cases, but information became available during reports of recoveries or fatalities. This is mentioned here only to explain why providing detailed cumulative numbers of newly confirmed cases, fatalities, and recoveries has become a significant challenge. Hence I shall revert to using officially reported cases as noted in the MOH summaries, and the periodic WHO updates.

The WHO/EMRO update included in part [3] also has excellent graphics and charts accompanying the SitRep that can be seen at: http://applications.emro.who.int/docs/EMROPub_2018_EN_16780.pdf?ua=1.
