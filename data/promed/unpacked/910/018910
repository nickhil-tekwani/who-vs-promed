Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Gabon/The Republic of the Congo
- WHO Update 7
--------------------
As of Wed 19 Dec 2991, 27 cases have been reported (25 confirmed
cases: 8 laboratory confirmed, 17 epidemiologically linked to cases
and 2 suspected cases under investigation) including 15 deaths. A
total of 227 contacts (having direct or suspected contact with the
blood or other body fluids of a case) have been identified and are
under active follow up.
Of the 27 cases, 16 were detected in Gabon and 11 in the neighbouring
villages of the Republic of the Congo. As of Wed 19 Dec 2001, 133
contacts are being followed up in Gabon and 94 in the Republic of the
Congo. The international team is operational on both sides of the
border and is working closely in the field with the team from the
Congolese Ministry of Health on outbreak control interventions.

[Since the last WHO update on 19 Dec 2001, there has been an
escalation in the number of cases and confirmed contacts. These are
largely accounted for by the reports coming from neighboring villages
in the Democratic Republic of Congo. These cases appear to represent
spread from the outbreak in Gabon and are not related to the suspected
viral hemorrhagic fever outbreak previously reported from the central
province of Kasai Occidental [in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
which is a different country altogether. - Mod.CP
