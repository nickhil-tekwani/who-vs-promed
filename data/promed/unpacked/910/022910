The Connecticut state Department of Public Health [DPH] is investigating an _E. coli_ [O157] outbreak linked to a farm in Lebanon [Connecticut] and the cases keep growing. As of noon Friday, 1 Apr 2016, DPH is investigating 34 confirmed cases of linked to the Oak Leaf Dairy Farm in Lebanon. As of Monday [28 Mar 2016], there were 15 cases.

The patients range in age from 10 months to 45 years, officials said in a statement. The patients include 6 adults and 28 children 14 years old and under; 18 of the children are age 5 years or under. In total, 9 patients have been hospitalized with 4 still in the hospital. 3 of the hospitalized patients have been diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome, a rare but serious illness that affects the kidneys and blood clotting system.

The outbreak was 1st reported on 24 Mar 2016 when 6 out of 7 _E. coli_ cases were confirmed in patients who had visited the Oak Leaf Farm and come into contact with goats there. 3 patients who did not visit Oak Leaf Farm but became ill with _E. coli_ after having contact with someone with an infection who did visit the farm. These people are referred to as secondary cases. DPH continues to monitor for additional reports of secondary cases. It's important for people infected with _E. coli_ or those with a family member infected with _E. coli_ to follow these precautions:

- Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water immediately after using the restroom or changing a child's diaper.
- Wash your hands before and after preparing food for yourself and others.
- Stay home from school or work while diarrhea persists; most people can return to work or school when they no longer have diarrhea. Special precautions are needed for food handlers, health care workers, and child care providers and attendees. Check with your employer before returning to work, and check with your child's child care center before resuming child care.

The investigation by DPH, Department of Agriculture, and the CDC is expected to last several weeks. DPH, in collaboration with CDC, is planning additional studies to better understand the scope of the outbreak and specific risk factors for illness among persons who visited the farm.

The farm is closed to the public.
