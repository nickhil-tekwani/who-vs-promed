An outbreak of the mosquito-borne chikungunya fever infected 17
workers in an area of Singapore and a Chinese national in another
area, as health officers are trying to contain the virus in the city-state.

There is no vaccine or specific treatment for the dengue-like
disease, which causes fever, rash and debilitating joint pain that
can persist for months.

Following the latest cluster of 3 chikungunya cases reported on [2
Aug 2008], the Health Ministry has been carrying out active case
detection at and around the site in Kranji Way, a northern industrial area.

So far, 282 workers have been screened, and 17 have tested positive
for chikungunya fever, the ministry said in a statement on its
website on Wednesday [6 Aug 2008]. These 17 cases have been admitted
for isolation and treatment in a communicable diseases center.

Preliminary investigations indicate that the Kranji Way cluster is
due to local transmission. Health officers have conducted intensive
mosquito control operations within the vicinity of the victims'
workplace and residences.

More than 23 premises have been inspected in the Kranji Way area, and
a total of 15 premises were found breeding the _Aedes_ spp. mosquito,
said the ministry.

Outdoor and indoor fogging of insecticide is also being carried out
for all the premises checked. "This intensive operation to seek out
and remove any mosquito breeding habitats will continue," the ministry said.

Previously, the largest chikungunya outbreak here was also
Singapore's 1st outbreak, when 13 people living or working in Little
India came down with the disease in January this year [2008].

Separately, a Chinese technician who lives in Miltonia Close off
Yishun Avenue 1 and works at Marsiling Industrial Estate was also
found to have contracted chikungunya. He fell sick on [18 Jul 2008],
and was hospitalized for 5 days.

Besides the 20 cases in Kranji Way, a total of 54 confirmed cases of
chikungunya fever have been reported to Singapore's health ministry
this year [2008], including 35 who contracted the disease overseas.

(NEA), press release [edited]

1. The Ministry of Health (MOH) is carrying out active case detection
at and around the site in Kranji Way arising from the latest cluster
of 3 chikungunya cases reported on [2 Aug 2008]. So far, our blood
screening of 282 workers as of [5 Aug 2008] has detected 17
PCR-positive cases [polymerase chain reaction]. These 17 cases have
been admitted for isolation and treatment in the Communicable
Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). The total
number of cases linked to Kranji Way currently stands at 20.
Epidemiological investigations are still ongoing, however,
preliminary investigations indicate that the Kranji Way cluster is
due to local transmission.

2. Since the notification of the 1st 3 cases, NEA officers have been
conducting intensive mosquito control operations within the vicinity
of the cases' workplace and residences and the areas that they
frequent. More than 23 premises have been inspected in the Kranji Way
area, and a total of 15 premises were found breeding the _Aedes_
mosquito. Outdoor and indoor fogging of insecticide is also being
carried out for all the premises checked. This intensive operation to
seek out and remove any mosquito breeding habitats will continue.
Residents and premises owners in the vicinity of Kranji Way have all
been advised to check their premises daily to remove any stagnant
water that may breed mosquitoes.

Update on chikungunya cases
---------------------------
3. MOH was notified of a new case of chikungunya fever involving a
technician (25-year-old Chinese national) who stays at Miltonia
Close. He developed symptoms on [18 Jul 2008] and was admitted to
hospital from [19-23 Jul 2008]. His movement history was largely
confined to his residence and workplace at Marsiling Industrial
Estate. MOH has conducted active case detection among his 10
household contacts. None tested positive for chikungunya virus. NEA
also checked 105 premises around the case's residence, and one
premise was found breeding the _Aedes_ mosquito. The check was
extended to the 23 factories at Marsiling Industrial Estate, and
breeding was found in one factory. Vector control operation is still ongoing.

4. Besides the cluster in Kranji Way (20 cases), to date, a total of
54 confirmed cases of chikungunya fever were notified to MOH in 2008;
19 were local cases and 35 were imported cases.

Ministry's advice to the public
-------------------------------
5. The Ministry advises persons who have traveled to Kranji Way
recently and develop symptoms of chikungunya, which include fever,
joint pain, and rashes, to consult their doctors.

6. There have been reports of chikungunya outbreaks in our region in
India, Indonesia, and Malaysia (Johor, Perak). Persons traveling
overseas are advised to remain vigilant and seek prompt medical
treatment if they are unwell and develop symptoms of chikungunya.

[To date in 2008, a total of 54 cases of chikungunya infection with
no associated fatalities have been reported in Singapore. The 1st
case of chikungunya infection in Singapore this year (2008) was
reported on 14 Jan 2008. A total of 8 cases of chikungunya infection
had been identified by 17 Jan 2008 (see prior PRO/MBDS posting
Chikungunya - Asia: China (Hong Kong), WHO, Singapore 20080202.0422).

Information on the surveillance and response over the 1st chikungunya
outbreak in Singapore was published in the April to June 2008
Epidemiological News Bulletin of the Ministry of Health, Singapore
and is available at
<http://www.moh.gov.sg/mohcorp/uploadedFiles/Publications/Epidemiological_News_Bulletin/2008/ENB02Q_08.pdf>.

Of interest is the discussion on the implementation of a surveillance
system in late 2006 in response to the major increase in chikungunya
fever occurring in the Indian Ocean region including India and Sri
Lanka. "The active surveillance (actively looking for cases) involves
a network of general practitioners (GPs) who are encouraged to
consider chikungunya fever as a differential diagnosis when dengue is
suspected (due to similar initial symptoms for both diseases). It
also involves testing of dengue-negative blood samples from hospitals
and general practitioners."

While the 1st identified case was a resident of a neighborhood
referred to as "Little India," suggesting a large population with
ties to India, this case had no history of travel outside of
Singapore for several months preceding the onset of symptoms. Hence,
the conclusion of the public health sector was that the case was
acquired through local transmission, suggesting that chikungunya
virus had been circulating locally as yet undetected. Active
surveillance was implemented, and an additional 13 cases were
identified residing in the same general location of the 1st case; all
13 were epidemiologically linked to an area of about 0.3 sq km, in
the vicinity of Little India. Of note is that the outbreak was
declared as being over on 21 Feb 2008, 2 incubation periods following
the date of onset of the last identified case.

As discussed above, the official report on the earlier outbreak
involved 13 cases. The newswire above mentions the identification of
20 cases (following implementation of active surveillance after an
initial cluster of 3 cases was identified) in this current outbreak,
suggesting there is an ongoing new cluster outbreak in the Kranji Way
area of Singapore. In a review of prior Ministry of Health press
releases on chikungunya (available at
<http://www.moh.gov.sg/mohcorp/pressreleases.aspx>), one sees there
was a final press release on the initial cluster on 6 Feb 2008. The
next press release is on 7 Jun 2008, when there were 2 cases from the
same household, neither one of which had a history of recent travel,
suggesting local transmission. On 12 Jun 2008, there was another case
identified, also locally transmitted. The next report of cases was on
1 Aug 2008, with a single case report; this was followed by a report
of a cluster of 3 cases in Kranji Way, 2 of which were foreign
workers, one from Bangladesh, one from India, with the 3rd case being
a delivery truck driver who made deliveries to the Kranji Way area.
It is interesting that 35 of the 54 (65 percent) reported cases were
classified as imported cases.

The Singapore experience is a good example of one of Mod.MPP's
favorite statements: "We live in a global village, and diseases do
not need visas to travel from one country to another;" (and as an
addendum, "nor do mosquitoes and other disease vectors.").
