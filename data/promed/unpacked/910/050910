Seven cases of the vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 -- a type of the crippling disease for which vaccinations in Pakistan were stopped in 2014 -- have been detected in the northern areas of the country over the past few months, it has officially been confirmed.

Sources claimed that officials concerned had been reluctant for some time to admit there was any case of the vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 in the country.

"It is not a wild poliovirus outbreak. It is an outbreak of Sabin-Like Type 2 Derived (SLT2D) [cVDPV - circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2]. Similar outbreaks have been recently reported in Philippines, China, Indonesia, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, and several other countries in Africa that have completely eradicated the poliovirus," special assistant to the prime minister on health Dr Zafar Mirza told Dawn.

There are 3 serotypes of wild poliovirus: type 1, type 2, and type 3, each with a slightly different capsid protein.

Pakistan has been giving type 1 and type 3 viruses in oral polio vaccines (OPVs), but had stopped administering type 2 vaccine in 2014, and the virus could not be found even in environmental samples since 2016. An environmental sample is declared positive if virus is found in sewage water.

"However, suddenly, cases have been reported from different areas, which means there was some vial left in some laboratory or somewhere else and started spreading due to human error. Just after getting the cases, which cannot be included in the number of wild poliovirus, we sent samples to the lab of Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, and after getting the confirmation that children were paralysed due to type 2 poliovirus, we have started polio campaigns," Dr Mirza said.

He said the virus had caused 7 cases of paralysis in recent months, mainly in the northern parts of the country. Outbreaks of polio occur where a large number of children were under-immunised, he added.

"The only way to reduce the risks of further transmission is to address gaps in immunisation coverage. The polio programme is working on a comprehensive outbreak response that includes rounds of vaccination in the area to protect every child under the age of 5 years. The programme has also enhanced its acute flaccid paralysis [AFP] surveillance by active search for additional cases, increasing testing of contacts of cases and strengthening environmental surveillance," he said.

He said through the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) schedule, children in Pakistan receive routine immunisation against 10 vaccine-preventable diseases (childhood tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, haemophilus influenza type b, pneumonia, diarrhoea, and measles). Through the service, pregnant women are also vaccinated against tetanus.

The secretary of the Ministry of National Health Services, Dr Allah Bakash Malik, told Dawn that Dr Mirza had directly taken the challenge and was being supported by the entire team in the ministry.

[In another media report it mentioned that the cases were identified in Islamabad and Diamer district of the Gilgit-Baltistan region (https://www.samaa.tv/news/2019/11/two-new-polio-cases-reported-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-2/). While Islamabad is a major, capital city that has significant transit of international and national visitors, the Gilgit-Baltistan region, located in a mountainous region of the country with peaks reaching 8000 m [26 247 ft] high, is somewhat distant from major urban centers and shares a southern border with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. A map showing the districts of Pakistan can be found at https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/pak215_pakistan_districts_v5_a0_20181203.pdf.

Information on the genetic profile of the VDPV2 isolates from these 7 cases might help to determine how long these cVDPV2s have been circulating to address the question of approximately when the original OPV2 (oral polio vaccine type 2) was administered. In 2015 there were 2 cases of cVDPV2-associated AFP cases reported in Pakistan, and in 2016 there was one case reported (http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus/). Possibilities for the origin of the current (2019) cases of cVDPV2 identified in Pakistan include continued use of the trivalent OPV, containing the OPV2 component past the cessation date, continued silent circulation of the cVDPV2 virus from 2015 and/or 2016, or reintroduction of a cVDPV2 from an importation event (a traveler going to Pakistan from an area with known (or unknown) cVDPV2 outbreaks), or reintroduction of an OPV2 virus in a traveler going to Pakistan from a zone where monovalent OPV2 has been used in campaigns to interrupt transmission of the cVDPV2 in an area.

We await further information on the genetic profile(s) of the cVDPV2s involved in the 7 AFP cases mentioned in the above article. - Mod.MPP]

The furious poliovirus has left 2 more children crippled for life as National Institute of Health (NIH) Islamabad on Friday [8 Nov 2019] notified new polio cases from Tehsil Sarai Norang Lakki Marwat, taking the total count of polio cases to 61 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa this year [2019] so far.

In his comment on reporting of new polio cases from Lakki Marwat, coordinator of Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) KP Abdul Basit said that it was a matter of grave concern and indeed a sad day that 2 more children are left disabled by poliovirus, says a press release here on Friday [8 Nov 2019].

He said one wild poliovirus has been isolated from the stool samples of 15-month-old and 22-month-old old male children, residents of village Chandu Khel, UC Kot Kashmir, tehsil Sarai Norgang, district Lakki Marwat.

The epidemiological study of the children showed that both children were zero dose for essential immunization while their SIAs history is under investigation.

He said that it was unfortunate that polio cases have jumped to 61 in the province with 14 cases from Lakki Marwat and 45 from Bannu division only.

Despite the fact that vaccine is available to prevent children from the disease, parents were not vaccinating their children due to misconceptions and were totally responsible for the disability of children.

He said that the virus is "on fire" in southern districts of the province, especially in Bannu division, and is circulating in the environment, hitting any unvaccinated or immune-compromised child.

He said the only viable solution to the problem is to vaccinate the child in every campaign, as only repeated doses can protect the child from permanent disability and stop virus circulation in the environment.

Abdul Basit appealed to parents not to pay attention to propaganda and rumors, adding that the polio vaccine was completely safe and [does] not cause any harm upon administration.

Earlier, speaking to members of Provincial Scholars Task Force and district communication officers here on Friday [8 Nov 2019] at EOC, coordinator EOC Abdul Basit said religious scholars can play a pivotal role in polio eradication, especially in addressing religious misconceptions, as people hold [the scholars] in high regards and follow their sayings. He said religious scholars can convince refusing parents and help the government achieve the goal of polio-free Pakistan.

[Reading the above media report, what jumps out is the statement that the vaccine was "completely safe and [does] not cause any harm upon administration." How does one explain this to the population when there is intense media coverage of the cVDPV2 cases recently reported (see section [1] above)? This is a point in time where assistance from medical anthropologists in the region could be very helpful.

With the addition of these 2 newly confirmed cases, the number of cases of paralytic disease associated with WPV1 reported by Pakistan is now 82 cases, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases with dates of onset in 2019 globally to 102. - Mod.MPP]

Cote d'Ivoire: Status: Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) detected in an environmental sample
---------------------------------
An isolation of a cVDPV2, from an environmental sample, was collected on [24 Sep 2019] in Abidjan city. The isolated cVDPV2, which is an orphan virus and linked to a virus detected in Niger in 2018, belongs to the Jigawa emergence group, which has previously also been detected in Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Benin, Ghana, and Togo.

The GPEI is working with regional and country teams to support local authorities to conduct a full investigation and plan a potential response if needed.

WHO Advice
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories, and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers.

[Yet another country has had cVDPV2 introduced that is related to the ongoing outbreak in Jigawa, Nigeria. The isolation of the cVDPV2 from environmental samples in the capital city is of concern, as there are more densely populated areas in a capital city where this virus is bound to infect the unvaccinated in inadequately vaccinated children. - Mod.MPP]

[Unfortunately, this past week seems to have been a very active week for poliovirus transmission detection. The summary statement of poliovirus isolates includes 4 WPV (wild poliovirus)-associated AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases and 11 cVDPV (circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus)-associated AFP cases. On top of this was the identification of 20 positive environmental samples for WPV and 7 positive environmental samples for cVDPV, with a new country -- Cote d'Ivoire -- having identified a cVDPV in an environmental sample this week (see section [3] above for more details).

For a map showing the locations of both WPV-associated cases and cVDPV-associated cases, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 24 countries: 16 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 3 in the Western Pacific, with either WPV or cVDPV isolates in their countries. An important reminder is that positive environmental samples means that the virus is circulating in the area where the samples have been obtained. Hence, if a susceptible individual is infected with the virus, there is a chance the person may develop paralytic disease.
