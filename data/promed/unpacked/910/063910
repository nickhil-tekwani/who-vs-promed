Sri Lanka: Preliminary Tests for Avian Influenza Infection Negative
-------------------------------------------------
Health authorities in Sri Lanka have revealed that 8 people recently died
from a virus which showed symptoms similar to bird flu. Officials in
Colombo said 100 chickens were culled, and tissue samples sent abroad for
testing for avian influenza virus as a precautionary measure. Initial tests
conducted locally on ill patients were negative for avian influenza virus,
which had not been previously detected on the island.
More than 50 people were receiving treatment in hospitals along the
southern coastal belt for severe respiratory difficulties, which medical
experts suspect is a variation of viral influenza.
Avian influenza hit several Asian countries this year, killing over 30
people, and resulting in the culling of millions of birds.

Sri Lanka: SARS and Avian Influenza Ruled Out
---------------------------------------------
At least 8 people died last week in southern Sri Lanka of a mysterious
influenza-like disease, but it was not avian influenza or SARS, the Health
Ministry stated on Mon 20 Dec 2004.
One of the deceased appeared to have died from influenza A virus infection,
by a particularly virulent strain of the virus, but all samples have been
sent to Australia and Hong Kong for more tests, said Health Minister Nimal
Siripala De Silva. De Silva said that the illness, which killed 8 people
between Tuesday and Sunday in the district of Matara, about 130 kilometers
south of Colombo, was neither SARS nor avian influenza. "There is nothing
to panic about and nothing to fear. We are doing our job," he said.
In 2003, SARS -- Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -- killed 774 people and
infected nearly 8000, mostly in Asia. Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus killed
32 people in Thailand and Viet Nam this year, but no cases were reported in
Sri Lanka. Some 25 cases of the undiagnosed virus had been reported in
Matara, said Nihal Abeysinghe, a senior medical officer with the Health
Ministry. The area is home to a large number of migratory birds.

Sri Lanka: Medical authorities Act to Allay Panic
------------------------------------------------
2 high-level medical teams are now conducting research and testing to
identify the mysterious illness spreading in Matara, Padanangala and
Embilipitiya. Healthcare and Nutrition Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva
told the Daily News that his Ministry has taken swift measures to control
this mysterious disease, which has so far claimed 4 lives. This disease is
suspected to be transmitted by a [respiratory] virus but is yet to be
identified.
Accordingly, 2 teams -- one from the Medical Research Institute (MRI) and
another from the Epidemiology Unit -- were dispatched to the affected areas
on the night of Thu 16 Dec 2004. "They are now conducting medical
investigations in collaboration with the doctors in the respective areas,"
added the Minister. Blood and sputum samples from the deceased, patients,
and suspected patients have been sent to the MRI for further testing. "They
are now under special medical investigation." asserted the Minister.
Minister de Silva explained that his Ministry had paid full attention and
taken prompt action to control the situation. "People do not need to panic,
as we have taken all precautionary measures," he added. Besides, the
Minister called upon the staff of hospitals not to panic. "All protective
gear and equipment have been sent to the hospitals in the affected areas
for the use of the staff from doctors to all the ranks. Hospitals have been
given permission to purchase locally any item if necessary," added the
Minister.
He also assured that all required medicine and drugs have been sent to the
hospitals in Matara and Ratnapura. "There is no need to panic. If there is
any suspicion, patients are requested to seek medical assistance from
Government Hospitals and medical centres."
Earlier, panic gripped inmates at the Matara Base Hospital on Thu 16 Dec
2004 with the death of 3 patients. Following the crisis, all in-ward
patients of the Matara hospital were evacuated to other hospitals in the
area. 2 of the 3 victims were brothers of the same family from the
Kuttigala area, while the other was a native of Beliatta and a relative of
the other victims. The victims were initially admitted with a fever and
treated at the ICU for 3 days before their death. 2 children of one of the
victims are also presently receiving treatment at the Matara bases
hospital. Their condition is being closely monitored, a hospital spokesman
told the Daily News. As a precautionary measure, all doctors and medical
staff at the Matara Base Hospital are wearing masks during duty hours.
Meanwhile another patient with symptoms of pneumonia was admitted to the
same hospital on Thu 16 Dec 2004. With the news of the crisis at the
hospital, there has a huge drop in the number of patients seeking treatment
there. Hospital Director Dr. K. I. Padmatilake said all steps have been
taken to counter any threat of an epidemic at the hospital.
Meanwhile a similar death was reported at the Embilipitiya Hospital
yesterday. The hospital employee who attended to this patient and another
patient on the ward were rushed to the Colombo National Hospital and a
private hospital for observation. The ICU Unit of the Embilipitiya Hospital
was shut down yesterday.

Sri Lanka: Mystery Disease Diagnosed as Influenza B virus Infection
--------------------------------------------------
The Healthcare and Nutrition Ministry yesterday categorically stated that
the mystery illness in the southern parts of the country was a type of
influenza which had links with neither avian influenza nor SARS.
"There is no need to panic. This has been identified as an influenza B type
disease. It is not related to Bird Flu or SARS. We have taken all
precautionary measures," Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva told a press
briefing yesterday [Mon 20 Dec 2004]. He said 2 high-level teams comprising
medical specialists have conducted research and testing to identify the
mystery illness spreading in Matara, Padanangala and Embilipitiya.
2 teams, one from the Medical Research Institute (MRI) and another from the
Public Health Department, had conducted extensive investigations. So far, 8
deaths have been reported from the disease. 15 suspected cases have been
recorded. "There is no need to fear. A similar outbreak occurred in Colombo
and its environs in 1998," senior Epidemiologist Dr. N. Abeysinghe said,
adding that they have implemented several universally adopted precautionary
measures to control respiratory diseases.
He said medical investigations conducted by the MRI had confirmed that this
was due to influenza B virus infection. "At the same time, it is very
difficult to tell the exact number of infected cases due to the common
symptoms. However, we are now implementing our precautionary measures,
having identified this as influenza B."
Dr. Geethani Wickremesinghe, a virologist at the MRI, said this is not a
mystery disease. "This has been found since 1919, and it is fairly common."
She explained that the complications are mostly found in very young and old
people and death could occur mostly among these groups. She said steps have
been taken to send samples to Hong Kong and Australia for further testing.

[The identity of the etiologic agent has still to be established beyond
doubt, but the "mystery disease" is clearly neither SARS nor avian
influenza. The most recent report suggests that influenza B virus may be
the etiologic agent. In the earlier reports, one of the 8 deaths had been
attributed to infection with a virulent strain of influenza virus, which
presumably now has been confirmed as a strain of influenza B virus. It is
not clear whether samples from any of the other patients have tested
positive for influenza B virus. Further information on the results of tests
on other samples and of testing of the materials sent to Australia and Hong
Kong is awaited. - Mod.CP]
[The newswires refer to a similar episode in 1998 which was covered by
ProMED-mail (see 1998 references below) at which time influenza A virus was
presumptively associated with the outbreak and increased morbidity and
mortality. - Mod.MPP]
