Boil smut [also known as common smut - Mod.JAD] is a large visible tissue
growth (gall) containing powdery reproductive spores. It was detected on 13
Jan 2006 on an isolated block of maize in the Gisborne area. There have
been no other reports of boil smut infections to date. Overseas boil smut
is not considered a major disease, but yield losses in some maize crops can
be significant from year to year. Evidence suggests that the smut has not
been present at the infected Gisborne location for very long. Biosecurity
New Zealand has placed a restricted place notice on the infected property
to contain the disease while investigations continue. Through the crop
health scouting program, other local maize crops have been investigated. No
other incidence of boil smut has been recorded.
Relevant industry groups have been informed. The infected site will be
grassed to stabilise the soil and protect against flood events. Next summer
the affected area will be solarized by covering it with polythene to kill
any spores. The restricted place notice will remain for 5 years and the
site will probably be left fallow for 5 to 8 years. These measures will be
followed by restricting maize growing in the affected field for years to come.

A serious disease, common smut, discovered in a Gisborne maize paddock in
January -- but not publicly announced -- has raised concerns about overseas
perceptions of New Zealand's biosecurity.
Genetic Technologies general manager Phil Evans said today it was a very
ugly and easily spread disease and could potentially close some export
markets in parts of Australia where there is no boil smut.
Biosecurity New Zealand has said it may have to expose the infected soil to
fumigants and sunshine, and leave the area fallow for 5 to 8 years.
The disease has the potential to severely affect overseas perceptions of
New Zealand's sweetcorn and maize industry if eradication measures are
unsuccessful.
Also known as boil smut, the fungal disease was found growing on sweetcorn
in a paddock in the Makauri area.
Although key industry players, major growers and neighbouring growers were
told about the incursion soon after it was found, there was no public
announcement. The quick action of a Gisborne crop manager, who had seen the
disease in the United States and knew it was not in New Zealand, led to
biosecurity officials being notified. After the discovery, the infected
plants and soil beneath them were removed and destroyed by incineration.
The remainder of the crop was removed and placed in covered compost heaps.
The field was then direct-drilled with grass to stabilise the soil over the
winter months. Because there is a chance of spores surviving in the soil,
eradication measures against the fungus will continue in the field in
spring and summer.
Gisborne is a major maize and sweet corn growing area and sweetcorn is big
business for the district's major food processor Cedenco. Cedenco's
agricultural manager, Luke Hansen, said it was hard to define the economic
significance if the disease were to establish in New Zealand. "The yield
ability of any plant that gets it is destroyed so it would depend how many
plants in any crop were infected." Education of growers, so there were more
eyes to recognise the disease it if it did appear again, would help prevent
it from establishing here in the future, he said.
The fungus affects only corn and maize plants and is present in most of the
corn-growing areas around the world. There is no known reliable treatment
but work is being done on developing a resistant cultivar across both maize
and sweetcorn.
Biosecurity officials traced the Gisborne infection to 2 batches of
imported seed and the remainder of the seed that was not planted in the
paddock was destroyed. The original seed consignment met the relevant
import health standard, had been fungicide-treated and was inspected.
The fungus can be dispersed by wind but they said the disease found in the
Gisborne corn crop appeared to be from infected seed rather than
wind-distributed spores because of the distribution of the infected plants.

[The crop plants maize (_Zea mays_) also known as corn, is a cereal grain.
It is called corn in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia,
but in other countries that term may refer to other cereal grains.
Varieties have been bred and selected for both animal feed and human
consumption. Sweet corn / sweetcorn is invariably grown for human
consumption and is usually shorter than field-corn/maize varieties grown
for feed.
_Zea mays_ develop symptoms of the disease boil smut (also known as common
smut) when infected by the fungus _Ustilago maydis_. _U. maydis_ is common
where maize is grown but has not been previously detected in New Zealand.
Boil smut is easily recognized by the tumor-like galls that form on any
above-ground plant part. The conspicuous galls that replace kernels are
covered with a greenish-white papery tissue. As the galls mature, the
interior darkens and turns into masses of powdery, dark olive-brown to
black spores. Ear galls may reach several inches in diameter. Galls that
form on other plant parts, including the tassels and leaves, are much
smaller. Although no maize variety is immune, some hybrids and varieties
are more resistant than others. Seed treatments are not very effective and
the disease is generally difficult to manage.
Boil smut was detected on 13 Jan 2006 on an isolated block of maize in the
Gisborne area of New Zealand. A report appeared in the May edition of a
government web site maintained by Biosecurity New Zealand (see item 1 in
this report). The maize industry in the Gisborne area, where the crop is
important, was informed. The news was not made public until newspaper
articles began to appear in late July 2006, one of which is included as
item 2 in this report. These articles pointed out the possible quarantine
implications of the discovery. It is noteworthy that in a report issued in
2000 the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service identifies boil smut
as having quarantine concern to Australia (3rd link in "Links").
This initial infection appears to be an isolated case and appropriate short
and long-term plans seem sufficient to minimize the impact on New Zealand
maize production. No further incidence of the disease has been reported.
In Mexico common smut is called huitlacoche , sometimes spelled
cuitlacoche, and is considered a delicacy, even being preserved and sold
for a higher price than maize cobs from uninfected plants. For culinary
use, the galls are harvested while still immature - fully mature galls are
dry and almost entirely spore-filled. The immature galls, gathered 2 to 3
weeks after an ear of maize is infected, still retain moisture and, when
cooked, have a flavor described as mushroom-like, sweet, savory, woody, and
earthy. Flavor compounds include sotolon and vanillin, as well as the sugar
glucose. Interest in having smutted maize for culinary purposes results in
some conflict between departments of agriculture and chefs in countries
other than Mexico, including the USA.
There are no previous postings on ProMED-mail on common / boil smut.
