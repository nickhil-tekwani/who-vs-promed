Laboratory testing at the University of Wyoming has recently confirmed a Johnson County cat was infected with plague, according to the Wyoming Department of Health. No human cases have been identified at this time.

The cat's home is in Kaycee, and the animal is known to wander outdoors. The illness was confirmed by the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory in Laramie. State health officer Dr. Alexia Harrist points out plague is a serious bacterial infection which can be deadly for pets and people if not promptly treated with antibiotics. However, it is treatable, and if treated it does not spell certain death as it did during the Black Plague.

This is the 3rd plague-infected cat identified in Wyoming over the past 6 months; the others were in Sheridan and Campbell counties. Only 6 human cases of plague have been exposed in Wyoming since 1978 with the last investigated in 2008. There is an average of 7 human plague cases each year in the United States.

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Surveillance efforts testing fleas are very important to detect circulation of _Y. pestis_ and risk of infection.

Plague may infect human beings through several routes: 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals (mentioned previously; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues, generally from an animal; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever (or chills). These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat-fight abscess.

Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities. Be sure to consult your veterinarian if you find a lump on your pet, as well as to get the best flea prevention treatment for your pet. It may be necessary to have your yard and/or home treated for fleas. Vacuum your home, including any bedding and furniture, and immediately upon finishing, take the vacuum bag outside, seal it in a plastic bag, and dispose of it. This type of cleaning will have to be repeated every week for 3-6 weeks to break the cycle of the flea in the home. This disease should be taken seriously, so please be sure your pet is on some form of flea prevention.

If your pets are not on flea prevention, please ask your veterinarian about the best flea prevention. Bathing your pet in dishwashing soap is not sufficient to help your pet avoid diseases carried by fleas. Some of the over the counter flea preventions may be harmful to your pet, so please check with your veterinarian. It is also a good time to make sure your pet is current on a rabies shot.

Keeping your pets inside is best, and being inside a yard will help diminish the ability to consume a dead animal and further reduce the risk of plague to your animal and to yourself. - Mod.TG
