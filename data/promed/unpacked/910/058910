Four men, aged 61, 50, 45 and 43, who live and work in the northern
Melbourne suburbs of Thomastown and Reservoir have been admitted to
hospital with Legionnaire's disease.
Two of the men are in intensive care.
Victoria's chief health officer Dr Graham Rouch said the four men were
diagnosed earlier today by staff at the Northern Hospital in Epping. He
said health officials had not yet been able to identify a common point of
infection.
