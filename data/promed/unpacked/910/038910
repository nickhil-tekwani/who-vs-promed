[Today's [4 Mar 2019] newly confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia is a secondary case in an individual from Wadi Aldwasir. Information was not available as to the type of contact (household, healthcare acquired, general community acquired from contact with known confirmed case), but unfortunately is a sign of continued transmission in the Wadi Aldwasir outbreak. With the addition of this case, it brings the total number of cases reported by Wadi Aldwasir to 51 (or possibly 52, counting the 16-year-old female reported from Riyadh city, but included in the WHO update on the Wadi Aldwasir outcome).

Since the beginning of this year (2019), there have been a total of 87 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia.

Since [27 Jan 2019], a total of 13 MERS cases were reported from Oman, including 9 from North Batinah (5 cases were previously reported in the Disease Outbreak News [11 Feb 2019, https://www.who.int/csr/don/11-february-2019-mers-oman/en/) and 4 from South Sharquia.

An investigation into the exposure history to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to symptom onset in all 8 cases is currently ongoing.

From 2012 through [18 Feb 2019], a total of 2357 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS, along with 820 associated deaths, have been reported to WHO globally. The 1st reported MERS infection in Oman was reported in 2013. Since then, a total of 24 cases and 7 deaths have been reported.

The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.

Whole genome sequencing of available human specimens of patients is being conducted. As of [21 Feb 2019], all identified contacts (family and health workers) of confirmed MERS patients have been screened, including 69 contacts from North Batinah patients and 57 contacts from South Sharqiyah patients. Tracing and follow-up of these contacts is ongoing by the Ministry of Health for 14 days from the last date of exposure as per WHO and national guidelines for MERS-CoV. All contacts have been sampled and have tested negative for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR.

The Ministry of Agriculture has conducted an investigation of dromedaries at the farms of 1 of the patients. Results of this investigation are pending.

The Ministry of Health has strengthened infection prevention and control measures in emergency departments, especially in triaging areas. Health education and awareness materials were produced and disseminated to health care staff, patients and visitors.

Family members of MERS-CoV infected patients have been contacted and advised about the virus and on measures to ensure personal protection to prevent infection. Efforts in improving public health awareness among the general public has been strengthened through greater messaging in the media.

Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans, especially from close unprotected contact with infected patients. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.

The notification of these additional cases does not change WHO's overall risk assessment of MERS-CoV. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (e.g. consumption of camel's raw milk), or humans (e.g. in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV between people in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Early identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.

WHO recommends that comprehensive identification, follow up and testing of all contacts of MERS patients be conducted, if feasible, regardless of the development of symptoms since approximately 20% of all reported MERS infections have been reported as mild or asymptomatic. The role of asymptomatic MERS infection in transmission is not well understood. However, reports of transmission from an asymptomatic MERS infected patient to another individual have been documented.

MERS causes more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with dromedary camels when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, and refrain from eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regards to this event, and does not currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions at this time.

[It appears as though there was transmission of the MERS-CoV in both South Sharquia governorate and North Al-Batinah during the months of January and February 2019. An interesting difference between the 2 locations is that transmission in South Sharquia was among men, whereas transmission in North Al-Bationah was among women.

In both governorates, there was person-to-person transmission. In the cluster in South Sharquia, it appears as though the apparent primary case had onset of illness in late January 2019 but laboratory confirmation wasn't until mid-February 2019. There were 3 additional cases, 1 in a healthcare worker, and 2 in other individuals presumably healthcare acquired contacts. In total there were 2 fatalities reported, the index case and another case with pre-existing co-morbidities. The high reported case fatality rate in this cluster (50 percent) is suggestive of the possibility of under-recognition of possible mild infections, when viewed through the lens of the case reports from Saudi Arabia during the past few years, with decreasing case fatality rates as more milder clinical illness cases are recognized.

In the continuing outbreak in North Al-Batinah, the original 5 cases involved 5 women, all from the same household that included a camel farm, although none of the women had given a history of contact with camels prior to their illness. There were 2 fatalities reported in the earlier cluster. The additional 4 cases from North Al-Batinah reported above involve apparent healthcare acquired cases, including 1 asymptomatic healthcare worker.

Some background information is that in earlier studies looking at seroprevalence among dromedary camels in Oman, 100 percent of camels sampled (50 out of 50) were found to have serologic evidence of prior MERS-CoV infection. (Reusken CB, et al. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus neutralising serum antibodies in dromedary camels: a comparative serological study. Lancet Infect Dis. 2013 Oct;13(10):859-66. doi:10.1016/S1473-3099(13)70164-6. Epub 2013 Aug 9. abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23933067).

A map showing the governorates of Oman can be found at https://www.mapsofworld.com/oman/map.html. South Sharquia and North Al-Batinah governorates are not adjacent to one another, with South Batinah and Muscat governorates separating them. - Mod.MPP]
