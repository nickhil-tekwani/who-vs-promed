I have received the following message from Dr Ted Tsai (CDC Atlanta [sic. -
CDC Ft. Collins]). I thought it would interest the group.
"I've been asked to respond to your query about JE in Pakistan and the need
for vaccination. I agree there are scant reports based entirely on PCR and
on serological diagnosis, which is difficult to interpret because of
co-circulation of West Nile virus. Nevertheless, after communicating with
the Pakistani neurologist working with Dr. Igarashi [Japan], I think there
is a strong possibility that JE is being transmitted in the lower Indus
valley.
I have been making note of this information and on a case-by case basis may
have advised immunization for certain individuals, but there is no official
recommendation for vaccination for travelers to Pakistan. I wonder where
you have seen such a recommendation published?"

[Others also believe there is clinical and serologic evidence for the
presence of JE virus in Pakistan but no firm data have been forthcoming.
Does anyone have definitive information? - Mod.CHC]
