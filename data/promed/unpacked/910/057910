Authorities of the Osorno Base Hospital just confirmed that a man in this
[health care] facility died, the 1st fatal victim caused by [a] hantavirus
[infection in this locality]. He was a resident of the San Juan de la Costa
community and died on 15 Apr [2010] in this hospital. Corresponding samples
were sent to the Institute of Public Health, which yesterday [20 Apr 2010]
confirmed the presence of the virus in the body of the patient.

[Sporadic cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) continue in Chile
this year (2010), including in this same province where on 23 Mar 2010 an
HPS patient was admitted into the Osorno Base Hospital (see ProMED archive
no. 20100329.0990). That patient apparently survived. The hantavirus
involved in this and other recent HPS cases in Chile is most likely to be
Andes virus, although the laboratory test results do not state that.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_),
the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at
