Malaria increase in Kerala State
--------------------------------------
Faced with a rising incidence of malaria and dengue fever cases in
Thiruvananthapuram, the Health authorities have chalked out an
exigency plan to effectively tackle the 2 mosquito-transmitted
diseases.
While malaria cases had surfaced at Valiathura, Beemapally, and
Shankhumukhom areas, there had been an outbreak of dengue cases
across the city. The Director of Health Services, V.K. Rajan, had
convened an urgent meeting on 2 Jun 2003 to discuss measures to
counter the twin menace. The Government is launching a month-long
malaria eradication campaign from June 15. An intensive prevention
programme would be launched against malaria and dengue with the
extensive participation of local bodies.
As part of the campaign, `fever treatment clinics' are being
established at malaria-prone areas in the city such as Valiathura,
Vallakkadavu, Beemapally, and Shankhumukhom. Inpatient facilities to
treat malaria patients are being readied at a special ward attached
to the Valiathura Government Health Centre. Another ward is being set
up at the General Hospital.
Since January 2003, there have been 28 confirmed cases of malaria,
while the incidence of dengue has been spread over areas such as
Venganoor, Pozhiyoor, Athiyannoor, Parassala, Vamanapuram,
Andoorkonam, and Sreekariyam.
Meanwhile, the Health Department will launch intensive vector control
measures in the malaria-prone areas. An estimated 5000 wells would be
taken up for larvicidal operations. Fogging would also be carried out
in these areas.

[Kerala State is a low-risk area for malaria in India, and
prophylaxis is usually not recommended for travellers. If indeed
there is a larger outbreak it may imply an upsurge of malaria in
Southern India, and further information is requested, not least as to
the species (_P. falciparum_ or _P. vivax_) involved. - Mod.EP]
