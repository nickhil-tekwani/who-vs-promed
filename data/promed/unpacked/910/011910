Comment on the "distance rule for mountain gorillas"
----------------------------------------------------
As Dr Toovey rightly remarks [see ProMED-mail post: "Respiratory
infections, fatal, gorillas - Africa (03) 20050720.2096"], not only is it
irrelevant to use data derived from transmission in an airplane environment
as a basis for comparison for human-gorilla transmission in the wild, but
it is also misleading.
To be sure, the impact level of transmission of a human pathogen to a
gorilla is not comparable to that of a human-human transmission, for the
simple fact that most humans can survive or be treated for respiratory
infections, and gorillas cannot.
Second, it seems that Dr Frankel confuses droplet and aerosol studies [see
ProMED-mail post: "Respiratory infections, fatal, gorillas - Africa (02)
20050719.2083"]. Droplets are heavier particles than aerosols, and small
aerosol particles can remain in the air and travel over a greater distance
than larger respiratory droplets. Airborne organisms such as influenza and
measles virus can remain stable long enough in the open for very light wind
to transport particles over great distances (Baker 1995, Cox 1995,
Ehreshman et al, 1995, Ungs 1995, Menkhaus et al. 1990). Influenza can be
transmitted at ranges of 15 to 20 meters (WHO 1999). Measles outbreaks have
been devastating in the past among mountain gorillas (Hastings et al.
1991). These observations have been confirmed by most recent evidence on
atmospheric and airborne spread of SARS and foot-and-mouth disease viruses
following the outbreaks of 2003 and 2004. Indeed a number of studies have
shown that virus-laden aerosols may spread from a common source (and even a
single source) to various locations at considerable distances (up to 50
meters!) from the source (Yu et al, 2004, Somogyi et al. 2004, Wong et al.
2004).
In short, to state that airborne transmission is unlikely outdoors is
simply incorrect. The 7 meter distance recommendations for gorilla tourism
took a number of factors into consideration, based on both controlled
environment data and the wide fluctuations that characterize 1 hour long
encounters with gorillas in the wild. However, in light of the new evidence
coming from SARS studies, and if one considers that 1) the distance rule is
most difficult to enforce given the highly dynamic nature of a gorilla
encounter and 2) the transmission risk associated with a shorter distance
may greatly compound the transmission risk associated with other factors
such as visit duration, stress, and -- as Dr Frankel himself points out --
the possibility of undeclared sickness by a tourist, 7 meters may grossly
underestimate the actual transmission risk generated by the thousands of
tourist-hours and days of human exposure that gorillas are subjected to.
Finally, it is critical to remember that respiratory diseases are but one
of a number of human-related factors threatening the existence of mountain
gorillas. If we want to maximize our chances of success at saving this
species, the only sensible attitude is one of maximum safety and restraint.
This is the very essence of gorilla tourism rules. Even from a purely
commercial point of view, gorilla tourism can flourish only if gorillas
flourish, hence the need to ensure first and foremost the health and
expansion of the mountain gorilla population.
