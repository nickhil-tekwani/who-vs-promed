RESEARCHERS DEVELOP RAPID AND SENSITIVE PRION TEST
October 1998
Nature Medicine Press Release
A team of researchers led by Nobel Prize winner Stanley Prusiner has
developed a test to distinguish between different strains of prion-the
infectious agent believed to be the cause of BSE in cattle and the
neurodegenerative Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease in humans. It is important to
differentiate between prion strains not only to better understand their
biological properties, but also because some strains are thought to result
in disease more quickly than others.
The new test represents a major advance because it allows sensitive and
rapid differentiation between prion strains in the test tube, compared with
existing methods that require year-long studies in mice. The fluorescent
immunoassay test works by distinguishing between the unique protein
conformations of the different strains.
In an accompanying News & Views article, Adriano Aguzzi of the Institute for
Neuropathology in Switzerland discusses the role of prions in disease and
writes that the "original and clever" test will be of "utmost interest for
public health."

Early media coverage of the putative test cites Dr. Fred Cohen as saying
that right now the test for finding the proteins, or prions, requires too
much labor for large-scale use on cattle, and further work will be needed to
produce a workable screening kit.
