I have been following this story since it broke in Dhaka in early 1996.
The following article came from the Guardian in London:

It is one of the biggest outbreaks of poisoning this century, and
foreign aid agencies are to blame. Water from wells dug by Western
engineers is contaminated with arsenic, and 30 million people risk
developing fatal cancers. Fred Pearce reports
Arsenic in the water
------------------------
For the past two decades, water from a million or more wells
sunk into the alluvium of the Ganges delta by agencies such as UNICEF,
the World Bank and Britain's Overseas Development Administration, has
been slowly poisoning Bangladeshi villagers with naturally occurring
arsenic. Now thousands of villagers are being diagnosed with the
debilitating marks of arsenic poisoning on their skins. Doctors believe
that hundreds of thousands more victims remain undetected.
And this is early days. A report by the World Health Organisation (WHO)
predicts that within a few years one in 10 adult deaths across much of
southern Bangladesh could be from cancers triggered by arsenic. "Tens of
millions of people are at risk," the World Bank's local chief, Pierre
Mills, said last week.
The international community is gearing up to handle a health crisis that
stretches across the border into the Indian state of West Bengal. On
Tuesday, British geologists in Dhaka launched a six-month emergency
project to uncover how and why the wells are poisoned.
"Within six months I hope we'll have answers to a lot of questions,"
said David Kinniburgh of the British Geological Survey. But much is
already clear - and it is deeply embarrassing for Western scientists and
engineers. For this crisis is entirely due to their failures.
Until the early 1970s, the 100 million-plus inhabitants of Bangladesh
and neighbouring West Bengal drank from shallow hand-dug wells, rivers
and ponds. But pollution was causing epidemics of cholera, and this
persuaded aid agencies to spend tens of millions of pounds sinking
tube wells - steel pipes fitted with simple hand pumps - to tap the
plentiful, and apparently clean, water in the sands and silt of the
Ganges floodplain. Following their example, villagers sunk many more
privately.
Today there are an estimated 3 million tube wells in Bangladesh,
providing 95 per cent of the drinking water. But until five years ago
there was no record of tests for arsenic on any of those wells.
This was a bad mistake. National surveys unveiled at an international
conference on the crisis, held in Dhaka last week, suggest 30 million
people are drinking water containing more than 50 parts per billion of
arsenic, five times the WHO's recommended limit. And more than a million
may be drinking water with a hundred times the limit.
"It frightens me to think how many people may be suffering," says
Dipankar Chakraborti of the School of Environmental Sciences at Javadpur
University, Calcutta, author of the largest study and the man who
uncovered the epidemic in India before discovering that its true heart
was over the border.
His findings have been confirmed by Bangladeshi government scientists,
who estimate that a fifth of the nation's drinking water has more than
50 ppb of arsenic. Not only that, but arsenic concentrations in many
wells is rising year by year, according to Salim Ullah Sayed at the
National Institute of Preventive and Social Medicine (Nipsom).
Travel almost anywhere in the lush, heavily populated Bangladeshi
countryside and you find victims. I went with doctors from the Dhaka
Community Hospital, who first raised the alarm within Bangladesh, to
Chandipur, a typical rice-growing village of 5,000 people in the
south-eastern district of Laxmipur.
When the doctors checked 800 people here, they found 286 with the
classic early symptoms of poisoning: melanomas on chest and hands; white
skin blotches known as leukomelanosis; keratosis, painful warts that
begin on palms and soles and gradually cover the body; acute
conjunctivitis and breathing difficulties.
Here I met Malabar, a 10-year-old boy whose skin is speckled with white
blotches. His friend Kawsar was covered in melanomas and keratosis. He
appeared mildly deranged and could barely walk. "For these boys the
prognosis is dreadful," said Susan Evans, consultant dermatologist at
Broadgreen Hospital, Liverpool, who examined 130 villagers with me in a
morning and diagnosed symptoms of arsenic poisoning among most of them.
A woman, Kulsun, showed the ulcers on the soles of her feet. Abdul had
sold all his land to buy useless treatment for his wife: "She used to be
the most beautiful girl in the village," he said. Safiq, an elderly man,
asked me: "Please come and test my well to see if the water is safe."
But the evidence of his own body, skin blotched and eyes bloodshot and
swollen, said it was not.
Several patients told us their relatives had died young showing similar
symptoms. And Evans confirmed: "These skin conditions are just the
outward and early signs. Many of these people will eventually die of
internal cancers. What is most alarming is that, even though this is a
cumulative poison, the children seem worse than their parents."
Of 166 wells sampled here recently, the average had 30 times the WHO
arsenic standard. Six were a hundred times higher. "The people in these
villages are very vulnerable," says Chakraborti. "Working in the fields
in hot weather, they drink five litres of water a day. And they consume
more through water used to boil their rice."
Chandipur is one village among thousands with similar stories. In Samta,
in the south-western district of Jessore, only five out of 282 wells are
safe. So far, 330 people have arsenic poisoning. I visited other
villages where a third of the people had symptoms, and met people with
amputated legs, gangrenous toes and gruesome melanomas.
Such evidence mocks the government's claim, repeated by a minister last
week, that it knows of only 2,000 cases. Especially when it turns out
these are from 152 villages. The World Bank says 43,000 villages "are
presently or could be in the future at risk".
Last year, the WHO sent Allan Smith, epidemiology professor at the
University of California, Berkeley, to report on the emerging crisis. He
warned that it is only just beginning. Keratosis, the most unambiguous
early symptom, takes 10 years to develop. "With large numbers of
tube wells dug five to 15 years ago," he wrote, "a major increase in the
number of cases can be projected." He predicted a doubling in the next
two years.
Cancers take longer to emerge. Smith warned that in much of southern
Bangladesh, a tenth of all adult deaths could soon be from arsenic
poisoning.
The Bangladeshi government and UNICEF stand accused of covering up the
disaster to protect their tube well installation programmes. Quazi
Quamruzzman of the Dhaka Community Hospital, convener of last week's
conference, says the government was told in 1985 that Bangladeshis
crossing the border to India for treatment for skin complaints were
being diagnosed with arsenic poisoning. A scientist at Nipsom told me
the arsenic problem was known about in government circles in 1990.
Some foreign water engineers are contrite, though they stand to gain new
contracts as aid pours in to alleviate the problem. Peter Ravenscroft of
British consultants Mott MacDonald, who has spent 10 years installing
tube wells here, admitted: "I've asked myself many times why I never
thought to check the water for heavy metals. But you associate them with
industrial pollution, not rural Bangladesh. And we knew of nothing like
it elsewhere."
"They damn well should have," responded one geologist. "There are plenty
of precedents if the engineers would read the literature. And don't
these guys ever do impact assessments on their projects?"
Meanwhile the installation of wells goes on. Last Saturday, the
Department of Public Health Engineering announced 286 new tube wells over
the past six months in Munshiganj just south of Dhaka - a district where
surveys suggest 80 per cent of well water is unsafe.
There is no effective treatment for arsenic poisoning, though doses of
vitamins can relieve symptoms a little. For most Bangladeshis, the only
chance of remission lies in finding alternative sources of clean
drinking water. Late last year, the World Bank earmarked $50 million.
The first task is to identify which wells are clean and which poisonous.
But with roughly one tube well for every four rural households that is a
huge undertaking.
The Dhaka Community Hospital advises people to switch to surface water
sources - the very sources abandoned a generation ago to halt cholera.
Oxfam's Enamul Haque says most of the hand-dug wells are abandoned and
full of rubbish. But he says old technologies could be revived and
improved, with simple sand filters to remove bacteria. And in a country
with nine months rain a year, "harvesting" of rain falling on roofs
could meet the drinking water needs of many households.
Many water engineers want to sink yet more tube wells, this time tapping
deeper alluvium, which is currently arsenic free. But Chakraborti fears
this will simply draw the arsenic down to the new wells. The arsenic
content of water from one deep well in Samta village increased fivefold
in six months.
In the 1960s, when foreign engineers came here to sink the first
tube wells, villagers warned that this was "the devil's water". They did
not know how right they were.
Underground Rivers of Arsenic
-------------------------------------
The arsenic currently poisoning Bangladeshis lurks in the fine alluvial
sediments of the Ganges delta. It is tapped by tube wells sunk to depths
of 20 to 100 metres - the great majority. Arsenic concentrations in well
water vary widely even between adjacent wells. But geologists hope that
if they can understand the chemistry that releases the arsenic from the
sediments into the water, they may be able to advise on how to sink safe
tube wells.
Dipankar Chakraborti of the School of Environmental Sciences at Javadpur
University, Calcutta, believes much of the arsenic is bound up in pyrite
minerals in the alluvium. He says heavy pumping lowers the water table
and allows the penetration of oxygen, which oxidises the pyrites and
releases arsenic into the water. "It's a reasonable theory," says David
Kinniburgh of the British Geological Survey, except that most of the
arsenic seems to come from layers that contain little oxygen. "It's a
reducing environment down there, not an oxidising one," he says.
Even so, he agrees that pumping causes seasonal fluctuations in the
water tables, and that could be a factor in whatever chemical
changes release the arsenic into the water.
Water movement underground could turn out to be the key. Hiroshi Yokota,
geoengineering professor at Miyazaki University, Japan, believes arsenic
poisoning is worst in wells sunk into ancient buried river channels,
where there are often fast flows of underground water. He found one such
underground "river of arsenic" beneath the worst affected part of Samta
village.
[Next week: On the road with the arsenic task force
19 February 1998
------------------------
The following was sent to me by a hydrologist, Rick Johnston, working in
Dhaka on the problem. The second paragraph is particularly relevant to
some list questions.
"As you can imagine there is a lot of fallout in Dhaka from that Guardian
article. UNICEF is particularly singled out for responsibility, and we
are working on a response now. I will contribute that response to the
group and whatever other information UNICEF has. The article does raise
some good questions, but it is sensationalist and there are many
inaccuracies. Peter Ravenscroft is particularly horribly misquoted. That
said, there is a huge problem here and response could have been faster.
I think you have some perspective on how long things can take to get
done here.
Real quickly, tolerance can be built up to arsenic so that people are
less susceptible to _acute_ poisoning. The fatal dose for humans for
As(III) has been reported to range from 70-180 mg. As(V) is much less
toxic in acute doses. What we are seeing in Bangladesh is _chronic_
poisoning, with intakes on the order of a mg/day. It is thought that at
chronic levels, arsenic speciation is less important, as As(V) is reduced
quickly to As(III) upon ingestion. A good first resource for this kind
of info is the WHO publication: Environmental Health Criteria 18,
Arsenic (1981)."
