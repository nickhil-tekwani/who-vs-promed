The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 8 Feb 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 806, of which 745 are confirmed and 61 are probable.
In total, there were 505 deaths (444 confirmed and 61 probable) and 273 people cured.
- 190 suspected cases under investigation.
- 6 new confirmed cases in Katwa.
- 3 new deaths of confirmed cases: 1 community death in Katwa, 2 deaths at the Butembo ETC
- 2 new recoveries released from Butembo ETC.

News of the response
New probable cases in Katwa [North Kivu]
----------------------------------------
- 7 new probable cases (historical deaths) have been validated retrospectively in the health zone of Katwa. These are people who became ill between November and December 2018 and who died between November 2018 and January 2019.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since Fri 8 Feb 2019, vaccination of primary health care workers has started in Rwampara, a new health zone in Ituri.
- Vaccination in this health zone is justified by the fact that Rwampara is located on the Bunia-Kisangani road, which is used by thousands of people from Beni. This vaccination of primary care providers in the Rwampara health zone is part of the preventive measures to limit the spread of the disease in the other provinces.
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 77 010 people have been vaccinated.

There's a little bit more detail in today's #Ebola update from @MinSanteRDC about the 7 probable cases added to the case count yesterday. These were people -- obviously contacts of cases -- who became sick in Nov & Dec & died between Nov & Jan. All were from Katwa.

- Sun 10 Feb 2019. Why Ebola vaccine on trial in the DRC is raising hopes
[The Conversation, abridged, edited]
https://theconversation.com/why-ebola-vaccine-on-trial-in-the-drc-is-raising-hopes-111126

The vaccine rollout
-------------------
The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is being tested in the DRC. It was first rolled out towards the end of the West Africa epidemic in Guinea in 2015. This was part of a phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine to prevent Ebola spreading among people.

Initial investigative data came from comparing a group of at-risk people who were vaccinated immediately after diagnosis of an Ebola virus case in their surrounding with a similar group of people who received the vaccine after a delay of 21 days.

The "immediate" group didn't contract Ebola while some individuals in the delayed group contracted the disease. This evidence gave the WHO hope that the vaccine could be 100% effective.

But that point hasn't yet been reached. More data and investigation are required before the vaccine is licensed for general use. The rollout of rVSV-ZEBOV in the DRC has been done using a conventional strategy common in other vaccine trials. Called "ring vaccination", it involves vaccinating the 1st and 2nd degree contacts of an infected individual. The aim is to form an immunised "ring" around every infection and prevent it from being transmitted further.

Since August 2018 nearly 66 000 doses of this experimental rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine have been administered in the DRC.

The WHO's confidence in the vaccine has been boosted by the fact that the cases of Ebola haven't increased at the same rates as was the case in 2014 in West Africa before the vaccine was introduced.

But vaccine effectiveness isn't always straightforward to gauge. Detailed data from the current outbreak will help make a more confident assessment and predict the future of its licensing and application.

The vaccine landscape
---------------------
Currently, the WHO and the international community are in favour of the Merck rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, as it has already been used and a number of studies prove that it's a promising candidate for licensing in the near future. Merck has recently promised to roll out another 120 000 doses of the vaccine to the DRC.

Further academic research on this vaccine has shown a sustained antibody response across 2 years, with little or no adverse effects to health in a large multicentre study.

In addition to rVSV-ZEBOV, other potential vaccines are also being investigated. 2 of them are being developed by Johnson & Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline. The former has tested a prime-boost vaccine, which is administered in 2 stages at different times; while the latter has introduced a single dose variant, administered as a one-time injection.

Another 2 candidates come from China and Russia. The one from China was licensed by the country without a trial or human efficacy data, and the one from Russia is also pending clinical trials. Hence, little is known about their safety and efficacy yet, and have not been employed during these outbreaks.

The challenge is to reach adequate numbers of susceptible people in unfavourable sociopolitical and underdeveloped infrastructure situations, such as those in many of the countries that are hot spots of viral outbreaks.

The viral disease burden in Africa is largely underestimated and the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is hopefully the first of many to be fast-tracked and invested in, to address what is fast becoming a global health challenge. It's certainly a much needed vaccine in the fight against Ebola.

[It's important to have more than one vaccine in the pipeline in case problems arise with the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, either in terms of efficacy or production. It would be informative to see the animal data for the Chinese and Russian vaccine candidates since it appears no clinical data are available. The Merck vaccine looks effective, but we have no data on those who were vaccinated but were not protected from disease. The sustained antibody response is very encouraging. It has been so difficult to reach the communities where vaccination is needed, prolonged immunity is important. - Mod.LK]

- Sun 10 Feb 2019. South Sudan (Yei River state) vaccinating health workers for fear of Ebola spread
[Radio Tamazuj, edited]
https://radiotamazuj.org/en/news/article/yei-river-state-vaccinating-health-workers-for-fear-of-ebola-spread

The ministry of health in South Sudan's Yei River state, with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), started vaccinating health workers against Ebola as part of preparedness measures to fight the spread of the disease.

Officials are afraid the Ebola virus is going to spread across the border from neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where an outbreak is still worsening.

Yei's health minister Kogo Manase Levi told Radio Tamazuj [Wed 6 Feb 2019] that they started vaccinating 400 health workers in the state. "All our medical workers in the state have been targeted for vaccination. I also want to take this opportunity to encourage all citizens and those coming from Uganda and DRC to use official routes. They must report themselves to the screening sites first," he said.

The minister said although the state has not recorded any case of Ebola, the government is on high alert.

The common border between Yei River State and DRC is porous and there is a lot of human activity.

The response team responsible for supervision in health facilities was attacked by young people from cell Ngothe B Mutiri neighborhood this Sat 9 Feb 2019. According to the head of the hospital Dieu-merci, the visibility of this team marked by the presence of the vehicle would be the basis of this attack. "This is not the 1st time that supervisors have come here, they come to supervise every day without a truck, but no harm has ever been observed," said Kabuyaya Wakinywa, head of the targeted structure. In an interview with our reporter, this official draws up a balance of 120 US dollars taken from the body of its structure, and the damaged truck. The agents of the response team were saved thanks to the intervention of the police.

- Sat 9 Feb 2019. Patient attendance decreases with the new modalities of free healthcare in Butembo
[Radio Moto Butembo-Beni, in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]
http://radiomotofm.info/lirearticle.php?billet=5415

After the new modalities of free healthcare, the attendance of patients has significantly decreased in health facilities. "With regard to the contract amendment since [16 Jan 2019], the movement of patients has become irregular within the structure, because there are certain diseases that have been discarded, and then there may have been a lot of conditions for care," said the health manager administrator in Katwa Health Zone.

[There is a suspect case now] and we will investigate to see if he is really sick of Ebola, " he added.

Since Wed 16 Jan 2019, we have reduced the package of services covered by free care in the health areas concerned.

[It is not clear why the services covered by free healthcare were reduced in January 2019, at a time when they were certainly needed, but could be a matter of not having the necessary financial resources. - Mod.LK
