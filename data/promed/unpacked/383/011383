Pakistani health officials Monday [21 Jan 2013] called for infants leaving the country to be issued polio vaccinations at airports after virus samples linked to a southern Pakistani city were discovered in Egypt.

Two sewage samples from Cairo were analysed and found to resemble a recently discovered strain in the Pakistani city of Sukkur, a joint statement by health officials, the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF said.

"To reduce the possibility of spread of poliovirus beyond Pakistan's borders, the government's Monitoring and Coordination Cell is advising to set up permanent vaccination counters at the international departure lounges of all airports," it said. The statement recommended that "all children under 5 years leaving the country are vaccinated against poliovirus."

Though Egypt has been polio-free since 2004, authorities there have ordered the immediate vaccination of all children less than 5 years of age in the areas where the samples were found.

Polio cases in Pakistan have risen sharply in recent years, hitting 198 in 2011 -- the highest figure for more than a decade and the most of any country in the world, according to the WHO. UNICEF's acting chief of polio unit, Michael Coleman said the incident highlighted the importance of vaccination in Pakistan. "It reinforces the urgent need of all caregivers across Pakistan to vaccinate children under 5 years of age against polio through the nearest health facility or through campaign vaccination teams," he said.

Shahnaz Wazir Ali, the prime minister's advisor on polio eradication, termed the case "a stark reminder of the risks associated with active poliovirus transmission in the country. Pakistan is one of only 3 countries where the highly infectious crippling disease remains endemic, along with Afghanistan and Nigeria.

Earlier this month [January 2013] Pakistan provided paramilitary and police support to polio vaccination teams in the northwest after a series of attacks on medical workers. UN agencies suspended work on a nationwide campaign to inoculate children against the highly infectious disease after 9 health workers were murdered in a string of attacks in the northwest and Karachi in December last year [2012]. Rumours about the vaccine being a plot to sterilise Muslims have long dogged efforts to tackle the disease in Pakistan. Suspicion of vaccination programmes intensified after the jailing of a doctor who helped the CIA find Osama bin Laden in 2011 using a hepatitis campaign.

Polio this week -- as of 16 Jan 2013
------------------------------------
13 Jan 2013 marked 2 years since the last wild poliovirus (WPV) case in India.

Afghanistan
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2012 remains 37. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [20 Dec 2012] (WPV1 from Nangarhar).
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2012 remains 4. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [3 Dec 2012] (from Hilmand).

Nigeria
-------
- One new WPV case was reported in the past week (WPV1 from Kano), bringing the total number of WPV cases for 2012 to 122. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [3 Dec 2012] (WPV1 from Federal Capital Territory - FCT).
- 2 new cases of cVDVP2, both occurring in Sokoto, were reported in the past week, bringing the total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2012 to 8. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [24 Nov 2012] (from Kebbi).
- Given the spread of WPV of Nigerian origin to Niger, targeted supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) will take place in high-risk and under-served local government areas (LGAs) in Nigeria. Special Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) for underserved populations were conducted [12-15 Jan 2013] in 11 high-risk states. LGAs of Sokoto, Katsina, and Zamfara bordering the recently-infected province in Niger are synchronizing SIAs with Niger this week ([15-18 Jan 2013]).

Pakistan
--------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2012 remains 58. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [30 Nov 2012] (WPV1 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa-KP).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2012 remains 15. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [8 Dec 2012] (from Sindh).
- District officials are assessing security conditions locally, in close consultation with law enforcement. A decentralized approach to vaccination activities is being used due to insecurity for polio workers.

Chad
----
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2012 remains 5. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2012 remains 12. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [20 Oct 2012] (from Wadi Fira).

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
--------------------------------------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. No WPV cases have been reported in 2012. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [20 Dec 2011] (WPV1 from Maniema).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2012 remains 17. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [4 Apr 2012] (from Katanga).
- The security situation in North Kivu continues to be monitored. Approximately 20 000 people have been internally displaced in Katanga and others from the Central African Republic have been displaced to Equateur.

Horn of Africa
--------------
- No new cases were reported in the region in the past week. In 2012 Yemen reported 2 cases of a cVDPV type 3, the most recent of which had onset of paralysis on [24 Aug 2012]; Kenya and Somalia reported 3 cases and one case respectively of cVDPV2 in a related outbreak, with the most recent having onset of paralysis in Somalia on [23 Jul 2012].

Niger
-----
- In the 1st outbreak of polio in 2012 outside of an endemic country or a country with re-established poliovirus, Niger has reported a case of wild poliovirus. This is the 1st case in the country since December 2011 and is related to virus originating in Nigeria.

West Africa
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. One WPV case was reported in the region in 2012, a WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012]. This is the 1st case in the country since December 2011 and is related to virus originating in Nigeria.
- Outbreak response has been launched, with the 1st immunization activities on [15 Jan 2013], in close coordination with Nigeria. These will be followed by NIDs with trivalent OPV on [2-5 Feb 2013] and with bivalent OPV on [2-5 Mar 2013], synchronized with campaigns in Nigeria.
- Planning has started for surveillance reviews and additional immunization activities in high-risk districts in West African countries which have suffered repeated importations of virus of Nigerian origin. Several countries in the region are in severe humanitarian distress. The risk of further spread from Niger is moderate, but such spread would have serious implications.

[The reports above highlight the ever present risk of spread of wild poliovirus (WPV) from the remaining 3 polio endemic countries to areas where WPV transmission has been interrupted previously. In the 1st report, there was the identification of wild poliovirus (WPV) genetically related to WPV circulating in Sukkur Pakistan in an environmental sampling of sewage in Cairo, Egypt. In the 2nd report, there was a case of WPV associated disease in Niger due to infection with a WPV genetically similar to a virus circulating in Nigeria.
