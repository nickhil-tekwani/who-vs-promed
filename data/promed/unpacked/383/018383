[1] Vermont: bobcat, human exposure

The bobcat that ran into a Windsor home and bit an elderly man had rabies, a test confirmed over the weekend.

"This one was definitely on the aggressive side of things," said Vermont Fish and Wildlife Game Warden David Lockerby. ".... You'd go up to the window and hear it making noises and jumping at the window."

The thin, adult male bobcat chased a house cat into the man's home through a pet door, the homeowner told police.

He tried to protect his cat, Lockerby said. The bobcat bit [the homeowner], but he was able to trap it between 2 rooms in his house. He had wounds on his knee and lower leg, said Windsor Police Chief Jennifer Frank.

Two game wardens from Vermont Fish and Wildlife arrived on the scene quickly, which allowed the police to focus their energy on getting the homeowner the medical help he needed in case of rabies, she said.

The bobcat was humanely and quickly euthanized inside the residence, Lockerby said. "Our biggest priority is human health and safety," he added.

The homeowner is doing "as well as one could do after receiving a bite from a bobcat," Chief Frank said. Although the Vermont Department of Health confirmed the bobcat had had rabies on Saturday [14 May 2022], due to a delay in communications, [the homeowner] did not hear the news until Monday [16 May 2022]. He is now receiving additional medical treatment.

Rabid animals pass along the infection through their bite. After a bite, rabies is preventable in humans with wound care and a series of injections given by a medical provider, according to the Vermont Department of Health.

The police were unable to locate the house cat, but the homeowner said it was all right, she added. [One wonders if this means the bobcat did not bite or scratch the domestic cat, or is the cat well vaccinated against rabies? This is unclear in this story. - Mod.TG]

"This is a fairly unusual circumstance," Chief Frank said. "Bobcats try to create space between themselves and people."

Rabies is a deadly virus infecting the central nervous system, according to the Vermont Department of Health. Rabid animals often lose their fear of people, becoming either abnormally friendly or aggressive. Some exhibit extreme depression or bizarre behaviors, such as staggering or seizures. Rabies is not common: in 2021, the agency found 18 out of 588 animals tested -- just above 3% -- had rabies.

[2] Georgia (Glynn County, St Simons Island): cat
Date: Thu 19 May 2022
Source: News 4 Jax [edited]
https://www.news4jax.com/news/georgia/2022/05/19/feral-cat-with-rabies-prompts-warning-for-glynn-county/


A feral cat on the south end of St. Simons Island tested positive for rabies after acting aggressively toward a family dog on Tuesday [17 May 2022], according to the Glynn County Health Department. The dog is up to date on rabies vaccinations and was taken to a local veterinarian for treatment.

The Glynn County Environmental Health team is advising those who may have had contact with the cat to get in touch with their health-care providers for further guidance.

Several species of wild animals that are native to coastal Georgia, including raccoons, foxes, and bats, can carry rabies, which is a potentially deadly virus primarily spread by infected animals.

According to the Mayo Clinic, once a rabies infection is established, there is no effective treatment. So it is important animals stay up to date on vaccinations and contact with potentially infected animals is avoided.

The Glynn County Environmental Health office offers these tips to protect you and your family from rabies:

- Avoid contact with animals you don't know.
- Make sure your pets receive the proper immunizations and boosters as advised by your veterinarian.
- Do not handle, feed, or unintentionally attract wild animals with open garbage cans or by leaving pet food out at night.
- Never adopt wild animals or bring them into your home. Do not try to nurse sick animals to health. Call animal control or a properly licensed animal rescue agency for assistance.
- Teach children to never handle unfamiliar animals, wild or domestic, even if they appear friendly. "Love your own, leave other animals alone" is a good principle for children to learn.

Signs of rabies in animals include a change in behavior, biting, aggression, showing no fear of natural enemies (such as humans), foaming at the mouth, and paralysis.

If an animal ever bites you, seek medical care immediately and contact Glynn County Animal Control at 912-554-7500 and the Glynn County Environmental Health office at 912-279-2940.

[3] Georgia (Glynn County, St. Simons Island): cat, human exposure
Date: Thu 19 May 2022
Source: Yahoo! News
https://news.yahoo.com/man-seeking-rabies-treatment-standoff-091800090.html


A 31-year-old Glynn County man is receiving precautionary rabies shots after he fended off an attack from a rabid feral cat with a child's baseball bat around midmorning Tuesday [17 May 2022] in the East Beach neighborhood on St. Simons Island.

The man killed the cat with the bat, ending an hour-long standoff in which the aggressive animal held a house painter at bay in the bed of a work truck, the man said.

The Glynn County Health Department received a verbal confirmation late Wednesday [18 May 2022] afternoon from officials in Waycross that the feral cat had rabies, said Sally Silbermann, spokeswoman for the Coastal Health District.

The cat did not bite or scratch the man, but he told The News on Wednesday [18 May 2022] he is taking the advice of health department officials to get the rabies treatment. [Very mad, aggressive animals with rabies may slobber or salivate profusely. Saliva in a cut or in the eye, can be as dangerous as the bite. This could be the case as why he is seeking treatment. - Mod.TG]

The workday for the pool maintenance worker, his co-workers, and the painter came to a standstill after encountering the rabid cat on 16th Street on East Beach. The man and a couple of co-workers were surprised to find the painter in the bed of their work truck after returning to the street from a backyard residential pool at around 10 a.m., he said.

"We came out to get some tools from the truck, and the guy's on our truck," the man said. "We're like, 'What the heck?' Then we saw the cat under our truck."

The painter had been cornered in the back of the truck for quite a while, the man said. Every time he tried to jump out of the back of the truck, the cat moved to his location and was ready to pounce, the painter explained to the pool workers.

The cat had already chased a dog, then chased the painter into the back of the truck after he tried shooing it with a broom, the man said.

The man had never seen a rabid animal before, but he knew right off the cat likely had rabies.

"He's rabid," the man said. "He's foaming at the mouth and convulsing. We knew something wasn't right with it."

The pool crew called their boss, who called animal control from the main office. And they waited as the hot sun bore down on the truck.

"He's sweating like crazy," the man said of the painter. "We watched the cat for about an hour. I felt bad for him, in the sun in the back of the truck. And there's a lot of tools back there, so he didn't have much room. We couldn't do anything. The situation shut down 2 job sites."

That is when the man grabbed a nearby child's T-ball bat and a sturdy cardboard box that had contained a pool pump motor he was installing.

"I put the box in front of the cat so he could not see me, and then I tried to block its view of the guy in the truck," the man said, whose name is being withheld due to medical confidentiality. "I had the bat for protection in case the cat came at me."

When the painter jumped from the truck, the cat went after him. Then the cat saw the man behind the box.

"As the painter ran away, the cat came out," the man said. "It saw me and lunged at me. That's when I hit it with the bat."

The cat died immediately after he struck it, the man said. He did not get blood on him or touch the cat.

He later washed the bat in bleach, the man said. An animal control officer arrived shortly after and took the animal, he said.

County officials, who said the cat was feral, sent it for testing at a facility in Waycross Tuesday [17 May 2022] afternoon. The county health department received a verbal confirmation of rabies late Wednesday [18 May 2022], Silbermann said.

The man later told a county health department official the cat did not bleed after being struck. When the official asked if the cat's saliva may have gone airborne in the encounter, he could not answer.

Once contracted, rabies is extremely lethal.

The soon-to-be father said he is taking no chances. His 1st shot is expected Friday [20 May 2022].

"It was crazy," he said. "But it's not worth the risk. I'm just gonna get the shots."

The Coastal Health District urges residents to avoid contact with wild animals. District officials also urge pet owners to ensure that their animals are vaccinated and that the vaccinations are up to date.

Wild animals such as raccoons, foxes, and bats are known carriers of rabies. Aggressiveness, fearlessness in the face of natural enemies, and foaming around the mouth all are typical signs of a rabid animal.

[4] Pennsylvania: imported rabies follow-up
Date: Thu 19 May 2022
Source: The Philadelphia Inquirer [edited
https://www.inquirer.com/health/rabies-dog-azerbaijan-pennsylvania-cdc-20220519.html


A vaccinated rescue dog imported from Azerbaijan to Pennsylvania in 2021 tested positive for a strain of rabies that's been eradicated here, setting off a contact-tracing mission which ended at an intern's desk halfway across the globe.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which regulates importation requirements for animals, detailed the June 2021 case in its weekly Morbidity and Mortality Report, released Thursday [19 May 2022]. The agency concluded vaccination records are not enough to ensure animals are disease-free when they enter the United States.

The dog with rabies was one of 34 rescue animals from Azerbaijan having entered this country through Chicago O'Hare International Airport in 2021. All had vaccination records and were cleared by inspectors at the airport as appearing healthy.

But shortly after one dog -- a 5-month-old, 19-pound mixed breed -- arrived at its adopter's home in an unspecified location in Pennsylvania, it began experiencing rabies-like signs, including excessive salivation, agitation, and biting at invisible objects. [These signs could also be canine distemper, but in this case turned out to be rabies virus. - Mod.TG]

At the veterinarian's office, the dog experienced seizure-like signs and went into cardiac arrest and was humanely euthanized. The Pennsylvania Department of Health tested the animal, confirmed it had dog-maintained rabies virus variant (DMRVV), a strain of rabies eliminated in this country in 2007. Test analysis found the dog had been insufficiently vaccinated against rabies.

After being notified of the rabies case, the CDC launched a contact-tracing effort to find any people who had been in contact with the dog. Researchers found 15 people -- an airport worker, 7 people in the dog's household, 3 pet-store workers, and 4 veterinary staff members -- had exposure that could have resulted in infection and were recommended for the rabies post-exposure prophylaxis.

Meanwhile, researchers also tracked down the 33 other animals -- all dogs except for one cat -- that had been sent to California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Washington. The CDC worked with health departments in those states to test the animals for rabies antibodies and give them rabies vaccine boosters.

Researchers found 8 of the animals were unvaccinated or insufficiently vaccinated, and were quarantined for 4-6 months. The remaining 25 with normal test results quarantined at home for 45 days because they had been exposed to the dog that had rabies. All 33 were released from quarantine by the end of December [2021].

All 8 of the dogs not having met the vaccine requirements came from the same rescue in Azerbaijan and were vaccinated at the same clinic there. The rescue and clinic reported a new veterinary intern was responsible for giving rabies vaccines. They found the intern's workstation had "numerous rabies vaccine vials with higher-than-expected residual volume," meaning used vials still had between 25% and 33% of the vaccine in them.

The CDC concluded the infection resulted from under-vaccinating the animals.

In July 2021, the CDC temporarily suspended dog importations from countries with a high risk of DMRVV. While in this case, the dog had been vaccinated -- but insufficiently -- the CDC has seen a "substantial increase" in attempts to import dogs with fraudulent or incomplete rabies vaccine certificates, the agency said. The suspension is still in place.

[5] New York (Niagara County): fox
Date: Mon 23 May 2022
Source: Niagara Gazette [edited]
https://news.yahoo.com/rabid-fox-reported-falls-214800998.html


An injured fox recently found on College Avenue in the Falls has been confirmed rabid, according to the Niagara County Department of Health.

A homeowner noticed contact between their 2 dogs and the injured fox. The owner will have the 2 vaccinated dogs receive precautionary rabies booster shots. The Health Department's Nursing Division will determine if the property owner may have had incidental contact with the rabies virus that would warrant rabies post-exposure treatment.

Animal rabies continues to be a serious public health concern in Niagara County. Rabies is a viral disease usually resulting in death of the animal not adequately protected with a rabies vaccination.

Bats, raccoons, skunks, and fox are all common wildlife carriers of the rabies virus, according to the health department. It is possible a rabid animal can shed (share) the virus by direct contact before signs appear visible. A rabid animal can only be confirmed by submitting a laboratory sample. [The head of the suspected rabid animal is submitted for testing, as the brain is actually used in the analysis. - Mod.TG]

The Niagara County Department of Health is reminding county residents of the following precautions to prevent exposure to rabies from wildlife and domestic animals:

- Do not feed, touch, or adopt wild animals, stray dogs, or feral cats.
- Be sure your dogs and cats are up to date on their rabies vaccinations. Vaccinated pets serve as a buffer between rabid wildlife and human. Protect pets with rabies vaccination to reduce your risk of exposure to rabies. Dogs and cats receiving their 1st rabies vaccine are protected for a one-year period. A dog or cat's 2nd and subsequent vaccination will protect from rabies for up to 3 years. Pets too young to be vaccinated should be kept indoors. By law, all cats, dogs, and ferrets must have current rabies vaccinations from 4 months of age and on. The Niagara County Department of Health will conduct free rabies clinics in 2022 and will post those dates on our website once the schedule is finalized.
- Keep family pets indoors at night. Do not leave them outside unattended or let them roam free.
- Don't attract wild animals to your home or yard. Keep your property free of stored bird seed or other foods that may attract wild animals. Feed pets indoors. Tightly cover or put away garbage cans. Board up any openings to your attic, basement, porch, or garage. Cap your chimney with screens.
- Encourage children to immediately tell adults if they are bitten by any animals. Tell children not to touch any animals they do not know.
- If a wild animal is on your property, let it wander away. Bring children and pets indoors and alert neighbors who are outside. You may contact a nuisance wildlife control officer who will remove the animal for a fee; or if there is danger, call a local law enforcement agency.

Bat rabies continues to be of particular concern. Niagara County residents must remain aware of the risk for rabies from any contact with a bat. Once illness occurs, rabies is almost always fatal. However, timely and complete post-exposure treatment is effective at preventing illness from occurring.

If you find a bat in your home, it is important not to injure, release or discard it. Immediately contact the NCDOH-Environmental Health Division at (716) 439-7444 to discuss the specifics of the situation or occurrence.

Report all animal bites or contact with wild animals to the Niagara County Department of Health Environmental Division. Further information on rabies can be obtained from the Niagara County Department of Health at <www.niagaracounty.com/health>.

[The articles in this update are quite varied. Perhaps the most unusual is the cat in the Georgia articles. The 2 articles are likely referring to the same cat. It clearly gives one a hint as to how vicious a rabid animal can appear. It should also highlight the very important need for humans to be aware of animal, and to vaccinate their pets as recommended by the veterinarian. The cat in these stories seemed quite agitated.

While pet doors can be very useful for pet owners, the story of the bobcat coming through the ped door into the home definitely would make me reconsider a pet door.

While snakes are seldom reported to have rabies, I have known people to find snakes coming in through pet doors as well.

Please be sure your pet is properly vaccinated against rabies, and keep your pet up to date on this very important vaccine. Be part of the group protecting their pets through vaccination, which helps build a barrier between you and this virus. Our pets are important to us. Let's protect them.

Please recall that any mammal can get rabies virus. Vaccinate your animals. Yes, cats and dogs, but also horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. Check with your veterinarian. - Mod.TG]
