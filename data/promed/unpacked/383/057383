Further information concerning the 2nd patient diagnosed in Romania
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The 2nd patient had symptoms for 2 months before admission but did not
seek medical care before being back in Romania. He worked picking
oranges in Greece without insurance.

He told us that many people from other countries, especially Pakistan,
also worked on the farms.

Bucharest, supports our previous hypothesis, that the cases were
infections transmitted from immigrants from _P. vivax_ endemic
countries. - Mod.EP]
