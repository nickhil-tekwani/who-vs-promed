Govt [Kenya] issues RVF outbreak alert
--------------------------------------
The government is on high alert over a possible outbreak of Rift
Valley fever (RVF) epidemic in North Eastern, upper Eastern and Rift
Valley provinces.

Livestock Minister Dr Mohamed Kuti says the 2nd round of the
vaccination campaign is due to begin in the affected regions to
prevent an outbreak of the disease. Kuti said on Thursday [20 May
2010] that his ministry is awaiting response from Treasury for
additional funding to enable it embark on round 2 of the vaccination exercise.

The Minister said already animals in the pastoralist regions are
infected but no deaths have been reported as they had been
vaccinated. "There is high activity of the disease in the animals in
pastoralist areas, but we are on high alert and intend to embark on
the 2nd round of the vaccination exercise so that we do not reach
epidemic levels," said Kuti who addressed a meeting at Kilimo house.

The Minister said already the government undertook a vaccination
exercise for one million heads of cattle to curb any outbreak this
rainy season.

Last year [2009] the government invested some 500 million shillings
[6.41 million USD] to undertake the off-take exercise during the drought.

RVF is a viral hemorrhagic fever which primarily affects animals but
can also infect humans. The disease also results in significant
economic losses due to death and abortion among animals infected.

A probable case occurs when a person or animal has acute fever with
unexplained bleeding in stool, vomit, sputum, gums, nose, skin and
eyes. The vision deteriorates, [mental status becomes] altered [and]
then loses consciousness.

The virus was 1st identified in 1931 during an investigation into an
epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of Kenya.

A major outbreak occurred in the country In 1997-98, during the El-Nino rains.

In December 2006, several deaths were reported in Garissa District.
Other hemorrhagic fevers that occur in sub-Saharan Africa are yellow
fever, Ebola, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and dengue viruses.

[It will be interesting to note if the vaccine used in Kenya is the
live attenuated (Smithburn) vaccine, expected to confer lifelong
immunity after a single vaccination but contraindicated for
application in pregnant animals, or the inactivated vaccine, which
can be used in susceptible animals irrespective of the stage of
pregnancy and lactation but requires a booster vaccination and is
more costly. Further details on both vaccines are available at
<http://www.obpvaccines.co.za/prods/14.htm> (live vaccine) and
<http://www.obpvaccines.co.za/prods/13.htm> (inactivated vaccine).

Forecasting RVF epidemics is partly based upon remote
sensing/satellite imagery; see FAO's guidelines on "Prevention and
control of Rift Valley Fever"
at <http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/006/Y4611E/y4611e07.htm>.
