Govandi and Dharavi are the hotspots of multidrug resistant-tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the city, suggest statistics released by the civic corporation on Monday [18 Nov 2013]. Almost 43 per cent of the people tested for tuberculosis at Shatabdi Hospital in Govandi since March 2013 suffer from MDR-TB. The corresponding figure for Dharavi is 35 per cent. "These 2 areas are among the 10 critical wards for TB that we had identified earlier," said a BMC [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, formerly the Bombay Municipal Corporation] official.

For the 1st time, the BMC also released data of patients under treatment with private sector doctors. "The government-run Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme has 30 000 patients who respond to 1st-line TB drugs. A year after the government made TB a notifiable disease, we have 10 000 patients from the private sector," said Manisha Mhaiskar, additional municipal commissioner.

Experts say the city should have as many patients in the private sector as are under treatment in the government sector. "We had expected 30 000 more patients, but we started the Nikschay computer programme in May 2013. We may have more numbers next year," said an official.

In a year that has witnessed a drastic rise in MDR-TB cases-from 53 in 2010 to 2502 in 2013 so far, the BMC plans to increase the number of GeneXpert machines across the city. "Over 50 per cent of MDR-TB cases detected this year [2013] are mainly due to the presence of GeneXpert machines that detect the resistant strain within 2 hours," said Manisha Mhaiskar, additional municipal commissioner.

While Shatabdi Hospital in Govandi got a GeneXpert machine in March 2013, Dharavi's civic urban health centre got one a year ago. The city made international headlines in January 2012 when a report of extremely extensive drug-resistant TB was published in a medical journal. The city has since been sanctioned a special TB control plan. The city, for instance, will get 3 GeneXpert machines next week, taking the count to 5. "We have also petitioned the Union government to give us 3 more machines."

Upgrade of its TB Hospital in Sewri will begin this month [November 2013] with the inauguration of a 100-bed dedicated wing for MDR-TB patients. "We want to make Sewri TB Hospital a centre of excellence. It will also get another diagnostic lab to test for line probe assay tests. We will make provision in the next budget for a 10-bed intensive respiratory care unit."

[India is one of 22 countries designated by WHO as "high burden countries" (HBCs) in regard to tuberculosis (TB); HBC account for about 80 per cent of the world's TB cases. In fact, India alone accounts for 26 per cent (about 2.2 million) of the estimated total of 8.6 million people worldwide who developed TB in 2012. However, almost 1.0 million of those in India who developed TB in 2012 were estimated to have not been reported to national TB programs for treatment (http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/gtbr13_executive_summary.pdf).

In 2012, an estimated 450 000 people developed MDR-TB worldwide (http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/gtbr13_executive_summary.pdf), and an estimated 64 000 cases of MDR-TB occurred in India (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/91355/1/9789241564656_eng.pdf); however, only about 25 per cent of this estimate were actually detected in 2012. This has occurred, in part, as a result of serious laboratory capacity constraints.

Although the news report above says that almost 35 per cent and 43 per cent of the people tested for TB since March 2013 in 2 slum neighborhoods of Mumbai, respectively, have MDR-TB, we are not told what percentage of people testing positive for TB have MDR-TB. For comparison, 1.1 per cent of newly diagnosed TB and 4.4 per cent of previously treated cases have MDR-TB in the United States (1).

Traditional sputum smear microscopy is the only laboratory test for TB that is commonly available in much of the developing world. It, however, misses smear-negative active pulmonary TB cases and is unable to detect drug resistance. Where available, conventional methods for mycobacteriological culture and drug susceptibility testing are slow, taking many weeks for completion of sequential procedures for isolation of mycobacteria from clinical specimens, identification of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex, and in vitro testing of strain susceptibility to anti-TB drugs. During the prolonged time required for testing, patients may be inappropriately treated, and drug-resistant strains may continue to spread in the community.

Several molecular methods have been developed in recent years for the diagnosis of TB and rapid detection of drug resistance. The Xpert MTB/RIF is a cartridge-based, automated diagnostic test that integrates sputum processing, DNA extraction and amplification, identification of _M. tuberculosis_ complex and resistance to rifampin. MDR-TB are defined as strains resistant to at least rifampin and INH, and rifampin resistance is used as a surrogate marker for MDR-TB, because 95 percent of the strains resistant to rifampin are also resistant to isoniazid (INH). Test results with the Xpert MTB/RIF can be obtained within 2 hours. Because of its high sensitivity to detect TB (similar to culture) and rifampin resistance, together with its ease of use, WHO endorsed Xpert MTB/RIF technology in 2010 and encouraged its rapid adoption in endemic countries. India has been a major procurer and has placed Xpert MTB/RIF at 32 sites (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/91355/1/9789241564656_eng.pdf).

In addition to Xpert MTB/RIF, high MDR-TB burden countries must, nevertheless, maintain reference laboratories for drug susceptibility testing of other anti-TB drugs, and the increased capacity to diagnose MDR-TB must be matched with supplies of quality drugs and capacity to deliver effective treatment and care.

Govandi and Dharavi are densely populated slums in Mumbai, India. For a map that shows the location of these communities, see http://www.distancesbetween.com/road-map/driving-map-dharavi-govandi/2248342/vi5/. Dharavi's total population estimates vary between 300 000 to about one million (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharavi). For photos of the Dharavi slum, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dharavi_Slum_in_Mumbai.jpg and http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Shanty_dwellings%2C_Railway_tracks_and_Mosque_in_Dharavi_Slum_Mumbai_India_February_2010.jpg. Much of Dharavi slum's low rental housing is without toilets or adequate water supply and was featured in the movie Slumdog Millionaire (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharavi). The problem of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Dharavi has been reported before; see (http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0012023) and the prior ProMED-mail posts in 2012. - Mod.ML
