A potato virus that has the potential to affect crop production has been found to be widespread, meaning eradication is impossible. The potato mop-top virus (PMTV) was discovered in Canterbury in 2018 [ProMED-mail post 20180925.6049697]. It was the 1st time the virus had been found in New Zealand.

A national survey to determine the extent of the disease has now been completed, confirming it has spread throughout the country. Biosecurity New Zealand response to PMTV will now be closed out. "It became evident that this disease couldn't be eradicated, and that the best outcome for potato growers was for industry management," [they] said.

Biosecurity NZ will support industry [to] develop the long-term management plan, which will include non-regulatory controls and voluntary agreements. Potatoes NZ said it was a successful end, and management of the virus had been successful so far. "We plan [to] incorporate research from world experts with best practice. A positive outcome to date is that there have been no significant losses to growers attributed to the disease," [they] said.

[Potato mop-top virus (PMTV; type species of genus _Pomovirus_) is spreading in Eurasia and the Americas. Other than potato, some weed species of Chenopodiaceae and Solanaceae are commonly infected in the Andean region but not elsewhere. Tuber yield may or may not be reduced, but economic losses are due to quality being severely affected. Tuber symptoms called "spraing" include brown lines, rings, and flecks. They normally remain internal but occasionally may extend to the surface, and some PMTV-infected tubers may not show any symptoms. Spraing increases in cool temperatures and with storage. Leaf and stem symptoms only appear if infected tubers are planted. They depend on variety and environmental conditions but may include yellow leaf blotches, leaf distortion, and shortened internodes ("mop-top").

PMTV is spread by the potato powdery scab pathogen _Spongospora subterranea_ (reclassified from fungus to protozoan) where it is retained in the sponge-like spore balls. The virus can survive in the vector for up to 18 years in the soil. Viruliferous vector can be spread with soil (agricultural equipment, human activities). Both virus and vector are favoured by cool, humid conditions. PMTV transmission through tubers is variable, and not all stems produced by a PMTV-infected tuber may become infected. In the absence of the vector it is thought that plants may become free of the virus after 3 generations.

Disease management is difficult and generally directed at the vector. It may include phytosanitation to minimise soil being carried on tubers or equipment, cultural techniques, chemical treatments of seed tubers, soil treatments to reduce spore numbers of the vector, as well as crop rotation (particularly with _Brassica_ species).

The detection of PMTV in New Zealand appears to be the 1st report of the virus for Oceania. Thus it is likely that the source of this incursion lies outside the region. Further work to determine a potential route of introduction may provide valuable information on biosecurity risks or failures associated with this detection.

Spraing symptoms can also be caused by _Tobacco rattle virus_ (genus _Tobravirus_) in some areas (see links below). Tobacco necrosis viruses were shown to cause necrotic symptoms on tuber surfaces. Coinfections of any of these viruses leads to synergistic enhancement of symptoms.
