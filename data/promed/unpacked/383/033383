A total of 29 people have died from cholera in Cameroon in the space of a week, the health minister said on Friday [25 Mar 2022]. Most of the deaths occurred in 3 cities in the west of the country, which has seen a spike in cases of the waterborne disease. Cholera is an acute form of diarrhea that is treatable with antibacterials and hydration but can kill within hours if left untreated.

"We saw a spike in cases of cholera in the Southwest region between 16-22 Mar 2022, with more than 300 cases registered," Health Minister Manaouda Malachie tweeted. He said there were "20 deaths in Kumba,... 2 deaths in Buea,... 5 deaths in Tiko (and) 2 deaths in Yaounde," the capital.

A total of 62 people had died since October 2021, and over the period nearly 2100 cases had been detected, Malachie wrote, adding that the authorities were coordinating a vaccination campaign and other measures to contain the outbreak.

Outbreaks occur periodically in Cameroon, a west African nation of more than 25 million inhabitants. The last epidemic was between January and August 2020, when 66 people died. The WHO said in early 2021 there were between 1.3 and 4 million cases of cholera per year around the world, leading to between 21 000 and 143 000 deaths.

[2] Cameroon: cholera

Cameroon's public health ministry says a cholera outbreak is sweeping across the towns of Limbe, Buea and Tiko, near the border with Nigeria. The government says 12 of the 600 patients rushed to hospitals in those towns died within the past 72 hours.

Nyenti Annereke, director of the Limbe government hospital, said the facility, which has a capacity of 200 beds, has received more than 240 cholera patients. "We built 3 tents in Limbe hospital yesterday [23 Mar 2022] because patients were at the veranda, in the corridors of the wards," he said. "All the beds were full. The Tiko district hospital, the capacity also is overpowered. The hospital in Bota is another crisis zone."

To cope with the overflow, humanitarian workers are helping to erect tents at the hospitals in Limbe and Buea. Still, the government says many families are rushing their sick relatives to surrounding towns, including Mutengene and Douala, a commercial hub on the Atlantic coast.

Bernard Okalia Bilai, governor of the South West region where Limbe, Tiko and Buea are located, chaired at least 3 crisis meetings on Wednesday [23 Mar 2022]. Bilai said the cholera outbreak is caused by a shortage of clean drinking water in western towns and villages provoked by the long dry season, and civilians should desist from drinking open stream water. He said the disease is spreading fast because cattle and civilians defecate in the open and in rivers. "Our structures, the hospitals are overloaded, but thank God that the medical officers in charge of those hospitals have been proactive and they have taken measures to receive various patients," he said. "All the patients are under treatment."

Bilai said the government will provide water to arid towns like Limbe, Buea and Tiko and surrounding villages but did not say when. Meanwhile, health officials are moving from door to door encouraging civilians to boil water from wells and streams before drinking it. The government says people should also eat only properly cooked food and wash their hands before and after meals, and after [going to the toilet].

Another cholera outbreak in Cameroon in February 2022 affected 1300 people and killed about 3 dozen.
