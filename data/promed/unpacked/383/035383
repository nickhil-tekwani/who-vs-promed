[2] USA: Frontier Airlines expands Ebola notifications to 800 passengers

http://www.wkyc.com/story/news/health/2014/10/17/frontier-expands-ebola-notifications-to-800-passengers/17424245

Frontier Airlines is now notifying 800 passengers about potential Ebola exposure tied to the case of nurse AV, according to CNN. Wed [15 Oct 2014], Frontier initially issued passenger notifications to 132 travelers on board AV's return flight to Dallas from Cleveland on Mon [13 Oct 2014]. This expanded notification by Frontier encompasses passengers on both of AV's flights between Dallas and Cleveland along with 5 other flights with the same plane. Health officials say AV, 29, could have been symptomatic with Ebola as early as Friday, 10 Oct 2014, while she was visiting family in Tallmadge to plan her wedding. Despite these additional precautionary notifications by the airline, health officials say passengers stand a low risk of being infected. AV is currently being treated in Atlanta.

[3] USA: Cruise liner banned from Caribbean ports
USA: Cruise ship carrying Texas Ebola nurse refused entry in Belize
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17 Oct 2014: (WP) A Texas health-care worker who "may have" handled lab specimens from Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan has been isolated in a cabin on board a commercial cruise ship in the Caribbean, according to U.S. Department of State. And Belize Coast Guard won't let the vessel or any of its thousands of passengers into port.... -- more

[The U.S. government is working to get her and her husband back home (see next report below). This shows a complete misunderstanding of the mechanics of transmission -- unless health authorities now believe (without any evidence) that asymptomatic (symptomless) contacts who are not coughing or sneezing can spread the virus. The viral load is so low in asymptomatic cases that it is only likely to spread on skin or mucous membrane contact -- and then to immunize rather than sicken. See also comment in next report below. - Mod.JW]

Mexico fails to grant access to cruise ship carrying Texas health worker
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USA, 17 Oct 2014: (WP) Updated and corrected. The cruise ship carrying a Texas health-care worker who "may have" handled lab specimens from Dallas Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan is headed back to the United States after Mexican authorities failed to grant permission for the ship to dock off the coast of Cozumel, according to a Carnival spokeswoman.

The Carnival Magic had been waiting off the Mexican coast since Fri 17 Oct 2014] morning for its scheduled port visit. Mexican authorities still hadn't given clearance by noon, so the ship continued to its home port of Galveston, Texas, where it was due back on Sun [19 Oct 2013], according to Carnival.

The health worker, a lab supervisor who has not been named, has shown no symptoms of the disease but remains on board and in voluntary isolation, according to Carnival. "We greatly regret that this situation, which was completely beyond our control, precluded the ship from making its scheduled visit to Cozumel and the resulting disappointment it has caused our guests," read a statement from Carnival.

The Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital employee and a partner boarded the ship 12 Oct 2014 in Galveston before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated the requirement for active monitoring, the U.S. State Department said in a statement. Although the worker is healthy, the U.S. government had said it was working with the cruise line to get the ship back to America "out of an abundance of caution."
The employee did not come into direct contact with Duncan, the 1st Ebola patient diagnosed in the United States. However, she may have been exposed to his clinical specimens, the State Department said.

Carnival said it would provide USD200 credits to guests aboard the ship and 50 percent discounts on a future cruise..... -- more

[Huge financial implications for the cruise lines -- let alone lost tourist income for the unvisited ports. Will all the thousands of passengers (capacity 3700), captain and crew (1367) then have to be monitored? The ship's next cruise cancelled? I would not be surprised to hear that half the passengers for that cruise have already cancelled, although there is no danger on board. I would snap up half-price tickets for their next cruise like a shot -- but will its cruise ports still ban it? 'Deep decontamination' will take weeks. - Mod. JW]

"The authorities in several countries have implemented entry restrictions to curtail the spread of Ebola from countries that have Ebola cases...."

Entry restrictions
------------------
Kenya on 10 Oct [2014] announced that it had closed the Suam border crossing (Trans-Nzoia county) with Uganda due to reports of an Ebola-related death in Bukwo district (Uganda). Earlier, the Kenyan authorities on 19 Aug [2014] suspended entry of passengers travelling from and through Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, excluding health professionals supporting efforts to contain the outbreak and Kenyan citizens.

Cape Verde on 9 Oct [2014] announced that it would now deny entry to non-resident foreigners coming from countries with 'intense Ebola transmission' -- Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia -- or who have been to those countries in the previous 30 days.

Mauritius on 8 Oct [2014] banned entry to all travellers who have visited Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, Senegal and Congo (DRC) in the last 2 months, rather than just citizens of those countries, as was the case previously. The authorities have announced that entry restrictions for travellers from Senegal and Nigeria will be lifted on 10 Oct & 17 Oct [2014] respectively, if no further cases of Ebola infection are reported [from them].

Seychelles on 8 Oct [2014] suspended entry to travellers who have visited Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Nigeria or Congo (DRC) 28 days prior to their journey, with the exception of Seychellois citizens.

Cote d'Ivoire has reopened in early October [2014] its borders with Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Equatorial Guinea is denying entry to travellers whose journeys originated in countries affected by Ebola.

Cameroon on 17 Sep [2014] reopened its borders to travellers from Senegal. An 18 Aug [2014] ban remains in place on travel from Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Southern African Development Community (SADC) member states -- Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe -- have stated that travellers coming from Ebola-affected countries (according to the World Health Organisation, WHO) would be monitored for 21 days and that travel to member countries for any gatherings would be discouraged. The SADC provided no details as to how member countries will carry out the associated screening and follow-up and it is likely that countries will have individual processes. There are also reports that some countries require health documentation for entry. Travellers are advised to contact the embassy or health ministry of their destination country to clarify their individual circumstances and prepare their trips accordingly.

South Sudan has placed a ban on travellers coming from Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia or Congo (DRC), or those who have travelled to those countries in the preceding 21 days. According to the health ministry, entry of travellers from Nigeria depends on their travel history in that country and whether they have visited Ebola-affected areas.

Namibia's foreign ministry on 11 Sep [2014] announced that foreigners travelling from countries affected by Ebola would be prohibited from entering the country.

Gambia on 1 Sep [2014] suspended entry of persons who have visited Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone or Nigeria in the 21 days prior to travel. Those travelling indirectly from any of the aforementioned countries to Gambia via another country also come under this measure.

Cote d'Ivoire announced on 23 Aug [2014] that it had closed its land borders with Guinea and Liberia.

Gabon stated on 22 Aug [2014] that it was restricting the issuance of entry visas to travellers from Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria on a case-by-case basis.

Rwanda, according to the US Department of State on 22 Aug [2014], has banned entry to travellers who have visited Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone in the 22 days prior to travel.

Senegal on 21 Aug [2014] closed its land border with Guinea, while the country's sea and air borders will also be closed to vessels and aircraft from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Chad on 21 Aug [2014] closed its land border with Nigeria at Lake Chad. The country previously reportedly banned the entry of any travellers originating or transiting through Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria or Sierra Leone, with airlines serving the country reportedly rerouting flights.

South Africa on 21 Aug [2014] restricted entry for all non-citizens travelling from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The government subsequently clarified that this was not a blanket ban and could be waived for 'absolutely essential travel'.

Flights and other transport
---------------------------
Countries that have implemented Ebola-related travel restrictions:

Gambia has banned the entry of flights from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone.

Gabon has banned the entry of flights and ships from countries affected by Ebola.

Senegal has banned flights from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Cameroon has banned flights to and from Nigeria.

Chad has suspended all flights from Nigeria.

Nigeria has suspended flights to the country operated by Gambian national carrier Gambia Bird.

Cote d'Ivoire has now lifted the ban on passenger flights from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Details of airlines that have restricted flights to Ebola-affected countries
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Air France suspended flights to Sierra Leone from 28 Aug [2014].

The Togo-based carrier Asky Airlines has suspended flights to and from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Arik Air (Nigeria), Gambia Bird and Kenya Airwayshave suspended services to Liberia and Sierra Leone.

British Airways has extended their suspension of flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone until 31 Dec [2014].

Emirates Airlines has suspended flights to Guinea.

Korean Air suspended flights to and from Kenya from 20 Aug [2014].

Senegal Airlines has suspended flights to and from Conakry (Guinea) until further notice.

Other airlines have modified their routes but are still operating regular scheduled services. These include:
- Royal Air Maroc
- Brussels Airlines

Medical screening
-----------------
Entry and exit health screening is now in place in numerous countries throughout West Africa and is being introduced in Europe and North America countries as well; related measures can include the partial closure of land borders, ports and river crossings in an effort to restrict cross-border travel. Members should allow additional time to pass through medical screening and not travel if they are sick. Staff should continue to monitor local media and this website for developments.

[Land and sea border "closures" in Africa -- and elsewhere in the world are likely to be ineffective. Smugglers have always been able to largely circumvent them -- I'm willing to bet even the 3 hermit kingdoms (q.v.) also have smuggling routes -- including international colleagues resident in Switzerland bringing in cases of fine wine bought for less across the border in France. Every so often, one was caught and fined.... (Like many other internationals, I lived in France, where the cost of living was lower, while working in Geneva, so had no incentive to do that.) - Mod.JW]

Colombia: cancels flights from West Africa because of Ebola

[I am reminded of what the president of one African country said to me when I introduced the WHO AIDS program to his country in the 1980s: "We do not have any cases. We'll just close our borders." The country had borders with 4 other countries, and of course the AIDS virus (HIV) got in. - Mod.JW]

USA: Travel ban for Texas health care workers in Ebola case
--------------------------------------------------------------------
17 Oct 2014: (USA Today) A health care worker who may have handled a specimen from the Liberian man who died from Ebola in Dallas, is currently on a cruise ship in the Caribbean. The U.S. government is working to get her and her husband back home. Texas health officials have ordered any person who entered the room of the 1st Ebola patient at a Dallas hospital not to travel by public transport, including planes ship, buses or trains, or visit groceries, restaurants or theaters for 21 days, until the danger of developing Ebola has passed.
