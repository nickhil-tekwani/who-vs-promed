Bluetongue situation in Spain
-----------------------------
It seems that the situation regarding the Bluetongue (BT) epidemic in
peninsular Spain is not getting better. The 2 new outbreaks, reported on 5
Nov 2004 in OIE follow-up report No. 3
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_20.HTM#Sec5>,
in Coin and Tolox (Malaga province), are about 25 km apart and more than
100 km east of the 1st cases reported in Jimena de la Frontera (Cadiz
province).
Perhaps more worrying is the information included in OIE's follow-up report
No. 2 of 29 Oct 2004
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_21.HTM#Sec5>
describing 2 new outbreaks in different localities situated more than 100
km apart in Extremadura, and 450 km northwest of the 1st outbreak reported
in Cadiz on 13 Oct 2004. The border with Portugal is not very far away,
there is active movement of animals between countries, and no geographical
barriers to stop the wind-borne vectors.
The presence of _Culicoides imicola_ has been reported all over the western
half of the Iberic peninsula, as far as Braganca in northern Portugal.
The last press report, originally in Spanish, reports the detection of one
clinical case in a calf, in Navarra, not far from the French border.
Reportedly, this case has been confirmed by the central laboratories
(Laboratorio Central de Veterinaria de Algete, Ministry of Agriculture).
In the same area, serosurvellance has detected 3 other positive cases among
1124 sampled cattle. No BT-positive animals were found amongst the 895
tested sheep. According to the report, _Culicoides imicola_ is not present
in Navarra.
Tracing of animals linked to the index case in Cadiz has led to the
detection of seropositive animals in other areas of mainland Spain, such as
Valencia, Salamanca, Zamora, Murcia, Malaga, and Cordoba, the press report
concludes.

Review of the bluetongue situation in Spain
-----------------------------------------
Since 14 Oct 2004, after the detection of the bluetongue virus in the
Province of Cadiz, the dispatch and export of live animals (and their
semen, embryos, and ova) of the bluetongue susceptible species (sheep,
goats, cattle, and wild ruminants) has been prohibited from some southern
provinces of Spain (see Midday Express of 14 Oct 2004) [20041018.2823]. In
the meantime, the presence of the virus has also been detected in other
parts of Andalusia and Estremadura. Therefore, the Standing Committee of
the Food Chain and Animal Health today [29 Oct 2004] decided to extend the
protective measures to a greater part of south Spain. The ban now covers
the provinces of Cadiz, Malaga, Sevilla, Huelva, Cordoba, Jaen, Caceres,
Badajoz, Toledo, and Ciudad Real. The surveillance zone (150 km around
outbreaks) also covers a small part of Portugal. The ban therefore also
applies to a part of the Portuguese provinces Alentejo and Ribatejo e Oeste.
Bluetongue is a fast-spreading viral disease of domestic and wild ruminants
transmitted by insects. It is not known to affect humans. For more
information on this disease, see

[Data on the identity of the BT virus (BTV) serotype involved will be
appreciated. In 1999, BTV-2 was reported from Tunisia, then spread along
the western Mediterranean basin to Algeria, Corsica Island (France),
Sardinia Island (Italy), and Menorca and Mallorca Islands (Spain,
collectively known as the Balearic Islands). Since then, the virus seems to
have become established in the said territories, demonstrating typical
seasonality, which reflects the activity of the relevant culicoides vectors.
A detailed table on sites and exposed animals, recorded between 12-15 Oct
2004, can be seen at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/maps/FCM%20ESP.pdf>.
A map is available at
<http://www.oie.int/cartes/ESP041104.JPG>.
Though initially the authorities reported BT in cattle, the table does not
specify which species were clinically affected. Clinical expression of
Bluetongue in cattle is exceptional in the Mediterranean basin; the
clinical disease has, so far, and almost in all cases, been limited to
susceptible sheep breeds. It will be interesting to note if the Spanish
situation is different, and also, to obtain detailed reporting. - Mod.AS].
