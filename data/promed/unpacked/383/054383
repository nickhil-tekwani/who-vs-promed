Halifax saw a sharp increase in the number of people who tested positive for syphilis in 2012. Last year, 59 people tested positive for the sexually transmitted infection, an increase of nearly 70 percent in just one year.

Epidemiologist Holly D'Angelo-Scott tracks the spread of syphilis in Halifax. "It's an outbreak. We want to stop this outbreak, so yes we are concerned," she said.

Syphilis is transmitted through oral, genital, or anal sex with someone already infected with it. Symptoms include hair loss, a rash, swollen glands, and muscle and joint pain, but they can disappear on their own and the infection remains.

Cases of the sexually transmitted infection have spiked since 2008, when it was virtually unknown in the city.

Syphilis by the numbers: in 2010, there were 11 cases; in 2011, there were 35 cases; and in 2012, there were 59 cases. So far, the syphilis cases are almost exclusively among men who have sex with men [MSM].

Health officials have been working hard to educate doctors and the public about the symptoms of syphilis, and how it's spread. "You can transmit syphilis through oral sex and some individuals don't seem to think that oral sex is sex, and are not as aware of the transmission of syphilis via that route," said D'Angelo-Scott.

She said the increase in positive tests could be a sign that public education is working. "So we're trying to verify that, we're trying to look to see whether or not there is been an increase in testing. That's what we're hoping."

Health officials have identified 28 places where men with syphilis first encountered their sex partners. Some were physical locations including Citadel Hill, but more than half of the hookups were arranged online, or by using apps on smartphones. Grindr, a gay dating application, is being blamed for a rise in the number of syphilis in the Capital District Health Authority, which said it hopes to launch a new education campaign in the spring through those same websites and apps.

"Get tested. Be aware. Know what the signs and symptoms are. Get tested so you can get treated," said D'Angelo-Scott. She said the outbreak in Halifax mirrors patterns in other Canadian cities.

[ProMED-mail reported in October 2012 on this outbreak of syphilis in Halifax, Nova Scotia (Syphilis - Canada (04): (NS) MSM, Internet 20121019.1353614). The increase in the rate of primary and secondary (infectious) syphilis in Nova Scotia, mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM) who meet their sexual partners on the Internet via smartphone applications such as Grindr has been seen elsewhere. ProMED-mail recently posted a report of a similar outbreak in Christchurch, New Zealand (Syphilis - New Zealand: (CA) MSM 20130309.1579043).

Grindr is a gay social networking application launched in 2009 and available worldwide that runs on iPhone, Blackberry, and Android devices (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindr). The app allows users to meet other men within close proximity using the mobile device's location-based services to show men nearby who are also on Grindr.

In the USA, the rate of primary and secondary (infectious) syphilis decreased among homosexual and bisexual males, largely because of changes in sexual behavior due to AIDS. However, a spike in the rate of infectious syphilis occurred in the late 1980s among heterosexual men, women, and neonates (congenital syphilis) that was attributed to epidemic of crack cocaine use and exchange of sex for drugs. Cases of syphilis again dropped from 1990 to 2000. In 2000, the rate of primary and secondary syphilis in the United States was 2.1 cases per 100 000 population, the lowest since reporting began in 1941. From 2001 to 2004, the primary and secondary syphilis rate increased nationally to 2.7, primarily as a result of increases in cases among men who have sex with men (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm).

As in the USA, the rates of infectious syphilis in Canada have been increasing since about 2000. In Canada, the male-to-female rate ratio increased from 1.5:1.0 in 1999 to 6.4:1.0 in 2008, reflecting that more males than females were reported with infectious syphilis, and this disparity increased over time (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php). In 2008, men accounted for 86.1 percent of reported cases. Between 1999 and 2008, the rate in men increased from 0.7 to 7.3 per 100 000 and in women increased from 0.5 to 1.1 per 100 000. In men, the highest reported rate of infectious syphilis was shared between 25-29 year olds and 30-39 year olds (13.3 per 100 000) (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php). Together, these age groups accounted for almost 40 percent of reported cases in men in 2008. In women, the highest reported rate was in 20-24 year olds (3.6 per 100 000). In males, the greatest increase in reported rates of infectious syphilis between 1999 and 2008 was in 25-29 year olds.

In New Brunswick, the Canadian province that borders Nova Scotia, ProMED-mail recently reported (Syphilis - Canada: (NB) 20120210.1038543) an infectious syphilis outbreak that was characterized as involving mainly males, most of whom are men who have sex with men (MSM). Many reported having multiple sex partners, including casual and/or anonymous partners, and at least 5 of the cases were co-infected with HIV. Reported increases in incidence of infectious syphilis among MSM have been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, and use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm).

Reported increases in the incidence of infectious syphilis among MSM have been attributed in part to "HIV prevention fatigue," which appears to limit effective condom use and to result in high-risk sexual behavior associated with use of drugs or the use of the Internet.

Nova Scotia in Eastern Canada is one of Canada's 3 Maritime Provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island). Nova Scotia is bounded in the west by New Brunswick. See http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Nova_Scotia%2C_Canada.svg to locate Nova Scotia on a map of Canada. Halifax, with a population of 130 130 in 2006, is the provincial capital of Nova Scotia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax_(former_city)).
