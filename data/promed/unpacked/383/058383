Taking a serious note of reports of scrub typhus from some parts of the state [West Bengal], the state health department has directed chief medical officers of health (CMOH) of all districts to be alert and vigilant and send details of all cases to the department. "Scrub typhus is a disease that can be treated with antibiotics if it is detected early. So, early detection is of the utmost importance. We have directed all hospitals to conduct blood tests if fever continues for a period of 5 days in a patient," a senior official of the state health department said.

The department has now equipped 19 hospitals across the state with facilities of kits for blood tests related to scrub typhus. The School of Tropical Medicine has been conducting blood tests related to the disease for many years. "If a patient is diagnosed with the disease, then the doctors have been advised to start treatment immediately," the official added.

According to sources in the health department, the Institute of Child Health (ICH) in Park Circus has had 300 cases of scrub typhus since August this year [2019]. The ICH has sent details of all these cases to the department.

[The laboratory method by which the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made in these patients is not stated. Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; confirmation requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region. The Weil-Felix test is unreliable (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16941792) and molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may not be available in endemic regions.

ProMED-mail has posted multiple reports of scrub typhus in several Indian states in the past, especially since 2011. For background information, see ProMED-mail post Scrub typhus - India (05): background 20111208.3546.
