Summary
-------
The objectives of this study are to report the emergence of lumpy skin disease (LSD) in Jordan and associated clinical signs, complications and preliminary economic losses. In mid-April 2013, 2 adult dairy cattle developed clinical signs suggestive of LSD and were confirmed as positive by PCR. The 2 cases were in Bani Kenanah district, Irbid governorate, on the Jordanian border of Israel and Syria. The disease spread rapidly to all the districts of Irbid governorate. During the month following the emergence of the disease, data were collected related to the epidemiology of the disease and the numbers of affected cattle on the premises. 41 dairy cattle holdings were surveyed. The morbidity rate ranged from 3 per cent to 100 per cent, (Mean 35.1 per cent, SD about 28.5 per cent). The mortality rate ranged from 0 to 20 per cent, (Mean 1.3 per cent, SD about 4.4 per cent). The case fatality rate ranged from 0 to 100 per cent, (Mean 6.2 per cent, SD about 22 per cent). The overall morbidity rate was 26 per cent, mortality rate 1.9 per cent and case fatality rate 7.5 per cent. Skin nodules, anorexia, decreased milk production and decreased body weight were common clinical signs, while mastitis and myiasis were seen as complications in a few affected animals. Decreased body weight ranged from 0 to 80 per cent, (Mean 23.1 per cent, SD about 15.7 per cent). Decreased milk production ranged from 0 to 100 per cent, (Mean 51.5 per cent, SD about 22.2 per cent). Affected cattle were treated mainly with broad-spectrum antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. The cost of treatment ranged from GBP 0 to GBP 84.3 [USD 136.4] per animal, (Mean GBP 27.9 [USD 45.1], SD about GBP 2.5 [USD 4]). LSD continues to spread through the Middle East region and poses a serious threat to the rest of Asia and Europe. International collaboration and communication is warranted to prevent the further spread of the disease to the rest of Asia and Europe.

[Subscribers are referred to the full article (subscription required), which includes photographs, detailed clinical descriptions and references. The following 2 extracts from the discussion chapter provide additional observations (references omitted):

1. "Countries in the Middle East region have become more vulnerable to foreign animals diseases due to the increasing demand for food from their growing populations. To meet this demand, Middle Eastern countries have increased rates of importation of live cattle from different continents such as Europe, Asia and Africa. There are no strict testing/quarantine measures in place to prevent these foreign infectious diseases from entering the region. In addition, there is a lack of transparency between these countries and the international organizations that aim to control and eradicate veterinary infectious diseases. The under-reporting of notifiable diseases by these countries is likely to be largely due to fears of affecting international trade, although most of these countries are principally consumers rather than producers. In addition, most of the veterinary authorities in these countries are inefficient, and there is a lack of laboratory capacity that hinders early detection of disease. The countries also have poorly organized veterinary services, a lack of notifiable disease control and prevention strategies, and no disease eradication policies."

2. "Lumpy skin disease spread rapidly through the Northern governorate of Irbid. There is anecdotal evidence that the disease has spread to the governorate of Ajloon, which is located south of Irbid governorate. Lumpy skin disease is a new disease for Jordan; however, there is now a high risk that it will become endemic in the country. This is likely due to many reasons. After the veterinary authority was notified, the possibility of disease eradication was not explored. It was fortunate that a local vaccine manufacturer had a reserve of the internationally used sheep pox vaccine (strain RM 65) to control the disease, which provided an immediate availability of the vaccine in demand. However, this was not of great help as vaccination was not started in the affected district until a few weeks after the emergence of the disease. In addition, no vaccination zone around the initial reported infection area was implemented and minimum numbers of cattle were vaccinated. Furthermore, animal movement restrictions were not enforced and most field veterinarians were not aware of the disease emergence until it was too late. Because the disease had been reported in neighbouring countries, a contingency plan should have been put in place by the veterinary authority to be ready for the imminent disease threat. Carrying out these actions could have prevented the rapid spread of the disease and possibly contained the initial outbreak."

In broad terms, the clinical descriptions from Jordan fall in line with other regional observations, covered in previous postings. Additional information may be found in the LSD chapter in the annual report for 2012 of Israel's State Veterinary Services, (in Hebrew, available online at http://www.moag.gov.il/agri/files/doh_shnati_2012.pdf). Subscribers are referred to the (bilingual, Hebrew/English) graphs "Distance from most far affected new herd to its closest previous affected herd" (page 19) and "Number of Lumpy skin disease outbreaks 1989-2012" (page 23). Results from Israel of observations addressing the efficacy of 2 widely applied vaccines are yet to be summarised and, hopefully, publicly available.

Jordan reported a total of 2 LSD outbreaks to the OIE, declaring the epizootic as resolved on 19 Sep 2013. The summary, including a map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013726_20130919_120410.pdf.

In addition to Jordan, LSD has been recently reported as circulating in Turkey (2013), Lebanon (2013), Israel (2013) and the Palestinian autonomous territory (2013). The disease has been reported in captive wildlife in Saudi Arabia, Oman and the UAE; information on its presence in domestic cattle there, as well as in Iraq (suspected), has been requested (postings 20130724.1842366, 20130718.1831781).

An extensive epizootic which took place in the Sultanate of Oman in 2009 has just been described in a paper reporting its 1st confirmation. The epizootic involved a large number of animals, covering a wide area including Nezwa, Alqabel, Sohar, Saham and Burimi. Morbidity and mortality rates of 29.7 and 26.3 per cent, and 13.6 and 15.4 per cent were observed at Nezwa and Sohar, respectively (ref).

LSD is known to be endemic in Egypt for decades. Its presence in Syria is yet to be reported.
