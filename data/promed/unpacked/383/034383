I would like to comment and ask for more clarification (having worked for
more than 20 years in the feed additive section).
Avoparcin was authorised in the E.U. (E 715) for use in "Chicken for
fattening" and "turkey for fattening" thus covering poultry, but also in
pigs, piglets, calves and cattle for fattening, while a claim for dairy
cattle was once on annex 2 (22). It would be nonsensical if the product was
only withdrawn in poultry. Further in paragraph 5 it is stated that it was
taken off the market in Europe, and that may be explained that the company
marketing it has taken it of the market, while in fact the authorisation
was withdrawn by the E.U. making it illegal to use it further. Last, [with
regard to the carcinogenicity of avoparcin, I would like confirmation if
that was the reason for not authorising it in the US.

[I think there are some journalistic errors in the initial posting in this
thread. First, the article refers specifically to the use of avoparcin as
a feed additive for chickens, but does not exclude non-poultry livestock
from the discussion. So, there is no argument with Dr. Jansegers about the
wisdom of including livestock other than poultry in the ban, and I have
made an unfortunate choice of titles for this thread. Second, Dr.
Jansegers is undoubtedly correct that the ban in the E.U. was prompted by
regulatory action rather than voluntary withdrawal by the manufacturer,
despite what it says in the article. Third, disapproval for use in the US
was related to the risk of spreading antibiotic-resistant strains of
bacteria, not to carcinogenicity. I can find two items in the US Food and
Drug Administration website that refer to avoparcin in the same paragraph
that the word "carcinogenic" is used, but carcinogenicity is never ascribed
to avoparcin. I believe that the journalist has misread these sections. -
