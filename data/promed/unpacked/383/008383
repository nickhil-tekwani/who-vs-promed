A Vermont horse has tested positive for eastern equine encephalomyelitis [EEE], a disease caused by a virus spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes.

The Vermont Agency of Agriculture says it was notified on Friday [14 Sep 2012] about the horse in Whiting. Officials say the animal started showing signs of the illness, including incoordination, on 6 Sep 2012 and was probably infected in late August or early September 2012. The horse was not vaccinated for EEE.

EEE can cause severe neurological disease in horses and usually death. The virus can also cause disease in other mammals such as llamas and alpacas and in emus. Officials say infected mammals are generally unable to transmit EEE to other animals or people.

Officials say horse owners should consult with their veterinarians to ensure that their horses are appropriately vaccinated.

[This mosquito-borne virus is no respecter of boundaries and has been found as far north as in Canada. It is very sad that owners still cannot learn to vaccinate to prevent deaths from EEE.
