Brazil's cocoa mid-crop shrinking
---------------------------------
Witches' broom fungus ravages the mid-crop now being collected, an analyst said. Witches' broom single-handedly knocked Brazil from the rank of world no. 2 cocoa producer to 6th place in the early 1990s when it swept through crop areas in the north-eastern state of Bahia.

"Many farmers are complaining," said analyst Thomas Hartmann. "You have an explosion of witches' broom all over the cocoa region in Bahia." He said 2 analysts forecast losses at 30-35 percent and as much as 50 percent. The apparent severity of the latest witches' broom attack shows the disease can still inflict heavy damage despite efforts to switch to resistant tree varieties.

"It is a combination of disease and bad weather," Hartmann said, referring to 3 spells of drought during the May-September mid-crop's development phase, which led to losses by killing off some of the early flowering that yields the crop. Though dryness usually inhibits the fungus, torrential rain most recently had enabled it to flourish, he said.

[Witches' broom (WB) of cocoa (_Theobroma cacao_) is caused by the fungus _Moniliophthora perniciosa_, which is specific to this host genus. It is a serious disease of the crop with yield losses of up to 90 percent or more. The pathogen is native to the Amazon and is now present in most of the cocoa growing regions in the Americas and the Caribbean.

Symptoms include the formation of multiple small shoots from flower clusters and branches ("witches' brooms"), which later become necrotic. Pods can become infected up to about 12 weeks of age and are often destroyed, or they ripen prematurely resulting in smaller or no beans. The number of pods affected depends on the inoculum pressure during the susceptible early phase of fruit formation.

Spore production occurs in small fruiting bodies developing on branches and pods during rainy periods. Spores are spread by wind, mechanical means, and with infected plant and other materials. There is currently no effective control of WB, but cultural techniques and grafting of established trees with budwood from varieties with reduced WB sensitivity are being used to reduce disease impact.

WB was detected for the 1st time in Brazil in 1989 in the state of Bahia. It ravaged production and yields in Bahia decreased from over 400 000 metric tons in the 1980s to less than 100 000 metric tons within 10 years. Further losses in many areas are due to abandonment of cocoa cultivation.

A related fungus, _Moniliophthora roreri_, causes frosty pod rot of cocoa. Both diseases are spreading in the Americas and the Caribbean. Collaborative programmes have been established for resistance breeding and to attempt to stop the spread. Both diseases pose a potential threat to cocoa growing areas in Africa and Asia if the pathogens are introduced there.

Cocoa trees produce 2 harvests per year, the main crop in October-April and the (usually smaller) midcrop in May-September. In Brazil, however, production of the midcrop is higher than that of the main crop.
