It's still unclear how a young Albuquerque mother contracted [a] hantavirus, but health officials are warning spring is when the cases surge.

The woman, 27, was diagnosed in February [2018]. She died this week, despite months of treatment.

Hantavirus is spread through exposure to the droppings and urine of certain infected rodents. The most common in New Mexico are deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_], which have a white belly. However, the CDC says the white footed mouse [_Peromyscus leucopus_] is found in most of New Mexico and the cotton rat [Sigmodon hispidus_] can also carry the virus.

The family says they have no idea how the young mother contracted the virus. Researchers say it doesn't take much to become infected.

"Sometimes patients contract hantavirus and don't recognize the rodent exposure, so they may have not seen mouse droppings or seen the mice," said Michelle Harkins from UNM Hospital. "It is possible for you to go into an area and sweep and cleanup and not recognize that you have this exposure." Researchers say you can also become infected through a rodent bite, but that is very rare.

They say the cases surge in the spring, likely because rodents become more active this time of year.

The symptoms are similar to the flu [but may progress to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. - Mod.TY].

[It is unfortunate that the young woman died of her hantavirus infection. She was mentioned in the ProMED-mail 2 Mar 2018 post (Hantavirus - Americas (18): USA (NM) 20180304.5664080) while still undergoing a prolonged hospitalization.

The hantavirus involved in this current New Mexico case above and other cases in the western USA is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time. As the above report notes, there is no information about the circumstances or the location under which this infection was acquired.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg, and a video clip of the mouse is available at the above (KRQE) URL. - Mod.TY
