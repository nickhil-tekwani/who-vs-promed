After reviewing the latest COVID-19 developments last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) emergency committee said the pandemic is far from over, though countries are making progress in rolling out vaccines and treatments. The group of outside advisors met on 22 Oct 2021 by video conference for the 9th time and unanimously agreed that the situation still warrants a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), which was declared on 30 Jan 2020. The group typically meets every 3 months or more often as needed.

In a statement released today [26 Oct 2021] on its deliberations, the group raised concerns about Africa's challenges in accessing enough vaccines, tests, and treatments and in monitoring COVID-19 spread, given that many countries have gaps in lab capacity and genomic sequencing (https://bit.ly/3vQCTwh).

The committee also said there's a critical need for all countries to use all tools at their disposal to ease the pandemic's many impacts. Committee members modified and extended most of their temporary recommendations but added a new one that supports uptake of WHO-recommended treatments by addressing access and affordability.

More global headlines
---------------------
- An independent monitoring board set up by the WHO and the World Bank in 2018 to track the world's outbreak and emergency readiness in the wake of West Africa's Ebola outbreak detailed the failures in the world's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Global Preparedness Monitoring Board -- in its new report -- said the failures stemmed from inequality and inaction and were worsened by political division. It called for new efforts to address future threats, including an international agreement on health preparedness and a global summit of health leaders to tackle the topic (https://www.gpmb.org/annual-reports/annual-report-2021).

- In vaccine developments, the Germany-based BioNTech, which developed the mRNA vaccine marketed by Pfizer, said today [26 Oct 2021] that it will build a vaccine production facility in Rwanda next year (https://investors.biontech.de/news-releases/news-release-details/biontech-plans-initiate-construction-mrna-vaccine-manufacturing), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the Moderna booster ([Spikevax]; https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/spikevax-ema-recommendation-booster), and China signaled that it will begin vaccinating children as young as 3 years old (https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-lifestyle-business-beijing-travel-4680b533429a7e3e75c6f99745b3664b [see comment below]).

- Meanwhile, in outbreak developments, the Chinese city of Lanzhou -- the capital of Gansu province and home to 4 million people -- is on lockdown after 6 local cases were detected, according to The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/26/china-locks-down-city-lanzhou-gansu-covid).

- In Europe, Russia and Ukraine -- 2 eastern European countries battling COVID-19 surges -- reported record daily highs for deaths today [26 Oct 2021] (Russia: https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-puts-onus-regional-leaders-step-up-covid-fight-2021-10-26/ and Ukraine: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-ukraine-deaths/ukraine-urges-citizens-to-get-vaccinated-as-covid-19-toll-hits-new-record-idUSKBN2HG1KB).

- The global total today [26 Oct 2021] climbed to 244 318 680 cases, with 4 960 323 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/).

[More regarding China and vaccinations: "Children as young as 3 will start receiving COVID-19 vaccines in China, where 76% of the population has been fully vaccinated and authorities are maintaining a zero-tolerance policy toward outbreaks.

"China becomes one of the very few countries in the world to start vaccinating children that young against the virus. Cuba, for one, has begun a vaccine drive for children as young as 2. The USA and many European countries allow COVID-19 shots down to age 12, though the USA is moving quickly toward opening vaccinations to 5- to 11-year-olds.

"Local city and provincial level governments in at least 5 Chinese provinces issued notices in recent days announcing that children ages 3 to 11 will be required to get their vaccinations."

"China in June [2021] had approved 2 vaccines -- Sinopharm's from the Beijing Institute of Biological Products and Sinovac -- for children ages 3 to 17, but it has only been vaccinating those 12 and older. In August [2021], regulators approved another, Sinopharm's from the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products.

"After the vaccines received domestic approval for children in China, foreign governments began giving the shots to children in their own countries. Cambodia uses both Sinovac and Sinopharm's shots in children 6-11. Regulators in Chile approved Sinovac for children as young as 6. In Argentina, regulators approved the Sinopharm vaccine for children as young as age 3.

"Many developing countries left out of the race to get shots from Western pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna bought Chinese vaccines. China has shipped more than 1.2 billion doses as of September [2021], according to its Ministry of Foreign Affairs" (https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-lifestyle-business-beijing-travel-4680b533429a7e3e75c6f99745b3664b). - Mod.LK]

[2] Children: Pfizer vaccine
Date: Tue 26 Oct 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/10/fda-panel-green-lights-pfizer-covid-vaccine-young-kids


The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vaccine advisory group today [26 Oct 2021] approved the emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5-11, putting the nation on a likely path to immunize younger schoolchildren with schools eager to avoid more disruptions and with holiday gatherings approaching.

With their vote, the 19-member Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) voted 17 in favor, with one abstention, that the benefits outweigh the risks of vaccination. The FDA typically accepts the recommendations of its independent panel. Pending the FDA's decision, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine advisory group is scheduled to discuss a vaccine recommendation for kids on 2 Nov 2021. The vaccine for children contains about one-third of the dose already approved for those ages 12 and older, consisting of two 10-microgram doses given 3 weeks apart.

Ahead of the meeting, Pfizer said the pediatric dose was 91% effective against symptomatic COVID-19. At today's [26 Oct 2021] meeting, Pfizer's representative, William Gruber, MD, said the 10-microgram dose was chosen because it was less reactogenic with similar immunogenicity as larger doses.

Fiona Havers, MD, an epidemiologist with the CDC's Division of Viral Diseases, today outlined what is known about the impact of COVID-19 on children. She said the 1.9 million infections in the age-group is likely a large undercount because children often have asymptomatic or mild infections. However, she noted that since 10 Oct 2021, kids are making up a growing portion of the nation's cases.

She said about 8300 kids have been hospitalized, with the biggest burden on Black, Native Americans, and Hispanic children. Nearly 100 children have died from COVID-19, a level similar to flu, Havers said. Though morbidity and mortality patterns are similar to flu, she added that kids hospitalized for COVID-19 are more likely to be treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) and need mechanical ventilation.

About 5300 kids have been diagnosed with a complication called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), Havers said. She also noted that though children can experience long COVID, their rates are lower than in adults.

One of the issues the group struggled with was assessing the risk of myocarditis, a rare and typically mild event reported in some younger men who received mRNA vaccines. Just ahead of the vote, VRBPAC member Paul Offit, MD, professor of pediatrics at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the data signals so far are reassuring, with lower levels of classic myocarditis occurring in children combined with a lower dose for children. He noted that so far, there's no sign that myocarditis levels are higher in vaccinated adolescents.

Some members had reservations about approving the vaccine for kids, including whether the scope of vaccination for kids should focus on at-risk youngsters. Cody Meissner, MD, director of pediatric infectious disease at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, said many parents are nervous about the vaccine, and he aired worries that other groups will mandate use of the vaccine, which he said he didn't agree with and would be an error.

Other members pushed back, saying that voting no on the vaccine would deny it to all children. Amanda Cohn, MD, chief medical officer for the CDC's National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases, noted that other pediatric vaccines -- such as flu immunization -- are aimed at diseases with death rates similar to or lower than COVID-19. "It's clear to me: The benefits outweigh the risks," Cohn said.

[Note comment in previous post that "children as young as 3 will start receiving COVID-19 vaccines in China...and 2 years old in Cuba" compared with the proposed 5-year-old lower limit for children in the USA. The children in the USA will receive one-third the dose of older children and adults. It is not clear what dose is being administered in China and Cuba to these very young children. Vaccination of children will help protect vulnerable individuals who cannot get vaccinated and will help slow virus spread in general to everyone. - Mod.LK]

[3] African Union: Moderna vaccine
Date: Tue 26 Oct 2021
Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/10/26/african-union-to-buy-up-to-110-million-moderna-covid-19-vaccines


The African Union (AU) intends to buy up to 110 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna Inc in an arrangement brokered in part by the White House, which will defer delivery of some doses intended for the United States to facilitate the deal, officials told Reuters news agency. The AU's doses will be delivered over the coming months, with 15 million arriving before the end of the year [2021], 35 million in the 1st quarter of 2022 and up to 60 million in the 2nd quarter.

"This is important, as it allows us to increase the number of vaccines available immediately," AU coronavirus envoy Strive Masiyiwa said in an email. "We urge other vaccine-producing countries to follow the lead of the [US government] and give us similar access to buy this and other vaccines." Masiyiwa said the Moderna purchase represented the 1st time the 55-member AU secured vaccines not fully produced in Africa.

Natalie Quillian, the White House's deputy coordinator for COVID-19 response, said the Biden administration is deferring delivery of 33 million doses it had bought from Moderna to give the AU its "spot in line" to make a purchase. "We are grateful to have helped negotiate this encouraging step forward between Moderna and the African Union that will significantly expand access to vaccines on the continent in the near term," Quillian said. The new shipments are well below what Africa needs to vaccinate its 1.3 billion people, who have had far less access to the life-saving vaccines than more prosperous parts of the world.

The USA, which has reported more than 700 000 COVID deaths, is flush with vaccines. The delayed Moderna deliveries will not have an effect on efforts to provide booster shots to already inoculated Americans, Quillian said.

Moderna said it was working to make it possible to fill doses of its COVID-19 vaccines in Africa by 2023 and has plans to build a manufacturing plant on the continent. "This is the 1st step in our long-term partnership with the African Union," Moderna Chief Executive Stephane Bancel said in a statement, referring to a Memorandum of Understanding to make up to 110 million doses for the AU.

Last month [September 2021], the AU accused COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers of denying African countries a fair chance to buy vaccines and urged manufacturing countries, in particular India, to lift export restrictions on vaccines and their components.
