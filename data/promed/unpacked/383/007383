The Ministry of Health (MINSA) announced that some 7 patients affected by [a] hantavirus are currently progressing positively from the disease in central provinces.

So far this year [2020], 7 cases of the disease caused by [a] hantavirus have been registered, of which 3 cases have been classified as hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS) and 4 as hantavirus fever," stated MINSA in a communication.

The epidemiological report stated that of the 3 registered HPS cases, 2 are from the Los Santos province and one is registered in Veraguas province; this case was also positive for COVID-19 [coronavirus] test.

As for the registered hantavirus fever cases, 4 were from the Tonosi district in the Los Santos province. It is important to stress that the 7 cases are progressing favorably with their disease.

Recommendations
---------------
MINSA requests that residents in the Los Santos, Herrera, and Veraguas provinces put into place the measures for cleanliness in and around their residences in order to avoid the spread of hantaviruses.

Other preventive measures recommended are:
- store grain in sacks and closed plastic containers, place them on pallets and separated from the walls;
- place firewood, lumber, or any other useful materials distant from the house, in an arid, dry area and on pallets;
- drain residual water from patios and keep them clean;
- keep the kitchen area clean and utensils in covered containers, to avoid that they enter in contact with rodents;
- open doors and windows for 60 minutes before cleaning areas that have been closed for a long time;
- spray the floor with water [a 10% bleach solution is better. - Mod.TY] to avoid raising dust [that may contain virus contaminated excrement from infected rodents].

[The central provinces in Panama, and especially Los Santos, are the localities where most hantavirus infections occur in Panama every year. The earlier WHO report indicates that Choclo is the hantavirus identified in these cases, based on genomic sequence analysis (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148).

Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED-mail from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report above, or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done, confirm the ProMED conclusion that Choclo virus was involved. Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama.

The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The WHO report above indicates that rodents are the reservoir hosts of Choclo virus but does not specify which rodents play that role. The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infections.
