According to the Arizona Department of Health Services, the recorded number of people who have gotten Valley fever [coccidioidomycosis] through March of this year [2018] is more than 1000 people higher than through March of last year.

The biggest increase when comparing this year to last came in January [2018]. There were 1055 recorded cases of Valley fever in January [2018] compared to 529 in January 2017. In February the difference wasn't as large. There were 742 recorded cases in February [2018] and 419 in February 2017. And in March, the difference between 2018 and 2017 continued to grow smaller with 664 recorded cases [in 2018] and 412 in March 2017.

The total number of recorded cases [in 2018] is greater than the total number of recorded Valley fever cases by this time in 2017. The total number of recorded cases as of March of this year [2018] is 2461. In 2017, the total through March was 1360.

If April [2018] has more than 427 recorded cases of Valley fever, it will continue the streak of Valley fever cases surpassing the 2017 numbers.

Researchers at the University of Arizona say the increase of Valley fever cases makes sense considering the time of year and the dry weather. "There's a seasonality to this," said Professor John Galgiani of the Valley Fever Center for Excellence. "We're entering one of those seasons right now as the winter rains have stopped and things seem to dry right out. Then when we get the monsoon, numbers tend to go down and [attack] rates go down until the fall when numbers come back up."

Valley fever can also affect dogs. In fact, dogs are more likely to get it. And living in Arizona also increases your chances of catching Valley fever. Researchers at the Valley Fever Center for Excellence say that two thirds of Valley fever cases in the US are contracted in Arizona.

Remember when hiking in or if you get caught outside during a dust storm that soil is where you get Valley fever. Spores from a specific fungus in the dirt come out when dirt is disturbed. Some symptoms of Valley fever include fatigue, muscle aches, and red bumps along your shins and forearms. If you think you may have Valley fever call your doctor immediately.

[The following is extracted from my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Coccidioidomycosis - Worldwide: outbreaks, epidemiology, 1940-2015:20180215.5630685:

Coccidioidomycosis is due to _Coccidioides immitis_ or _C. posadasii_, 2 nearly identical species of pathogenic fungi that grow in the top 2-8 inches (5 to 20 cm) of soil where the organism produces arthroconidia that can be disrupted and become airborne during conditions that disturb the soil. Coccidioidomycosis occurs in hot, semi-arid regions in the southwestern United States (mainly the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas, but also Nevada, Utah, and Washington State), parts of northern Mexico, and in Central and South America. The airborne spores then can travel great distances by currents of air. If inhaled, the airborne spores can produce infection in humans, as well as other animals.

Coccidioidomycosis is not transmitted from person to person. Risk of infection is highest in dry summer months. A 2nd period of risk usually occurs in the late fall, terminating with winter rains. Dust exposure is critical for acquiring an infection. Indeed, an outbreak of coccidioidomycosis followed exposure to a dust cloud that was blown downwind from the January 1994 6.7 magnitude Northridge California earthquake and its after shocks (CDC. Coccidioidomycosis following the Northridge earthquake -- California, 1994. JAMA. 1994; 271(22): 1735; available at https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/374020).

Because the incubation period for this infection usually ranges from 1-4 weeks, tourists who became infected while visiting areas where coccidioidomycosis is endemic may not become ill until after they return home, and the diagnosis may not be considered by clinicians in areas where coccidioidomycosis is not endemic (See prior ProMED-mail posts on coccidioidomycosis in travelers: Coccidioidomycosis - Taiwan ex USA 20090610.2140 and Coccidioidomycosis - Europe ex USA (Calif): alert 20011214.3026).

Most patients who become infected following exposure are asymptomatic, but have immunological evidence of coccidioidomycosis. Within some endemic communities in the central valley of California, nearly the entire population has serological evidence of prior infection. Infection generally imparts immunity to reinfection.

Risk factors for more severe pulmonary disease include diabetes, recent history of cigarette smoking, income of less than USD 15 000 per year, and older age (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11229838). Disseminated infection occurs more frequently in certain ethnic groups (persons of African, Filipino, and, to a lesser extent, Hispanic descent), pregnancy, and immunodeficiency, such as that due to AIDS or by immunosuppressive drugs.

Reasons for increased cases of coccidioidomycosis are not fully understood. The increase can in part be attributed to increased reporting practices, climatic change (drought and increasing temperatures in the southwestern United States) (http://www.demos.org/publication/economic-and-environmental-impacts-climate-change-arizona), dust storms, soil disturbance caused by increased construction activity, growing numbers of persons who are immunocompromised or have other risk factors for severe disease, and immigration to endemic areas of previously unexposed persons from areas where coccidioidomycosis is not endemic (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5805a1.htm).
