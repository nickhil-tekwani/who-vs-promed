Swine Influenza Virus reassorted with Pandemic H1N1 Virus isolated from Pig
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The University of Hong Kong (HKU) had found in its regular influenza
virus surveillance programme that one sample taken from a pig at the
Sheung Shui Slaughterhouse on 7 Jan 2010 contained a virus which was
essentially a swine influenza virus but had picked up a pandemic H1N1
gene by genetic reassortment. There is no cause for alarm for public
health and pork remains safe for consumption. The government is
closely monitoring developments and shall continue to keep the public informed.

This is the 1st time that reassortment of swine influenza virus with
the pandemic H1N1 virus has been found in the
surveillance programme. Prof Malik Peiris, the HKU expert in charge
of the surveillance programme, considered that the findings of
reassortment between the pandemic H1N1 virus and swine influenza
virus was not totally unexpected. These events were likely occurring
worldwide and its detection in Hong Kong was purely the consequence
of intensive surveillance. Further tests are being conducted by HKU
to determine if there are any particular characteristics of this strain.

A spokesman for the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) reaffirmed that the
World Health Organization (WHO), World Organisation for Animal Health
(OIE) and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
(FAO) had stated that pork and pork products which were handled
properly and thoroughly cooked were safe for human consumption. It
is safe to eat pork and pork products that are cooked to an internal
temperature of 70 degrees Celsius [158 deg F] or above.

A spokesman for the Centre for Health Protection also said:
"Laboratory surveillance on human specimens by the Department of
Health (DH) has not detected similar viruses in humans. There is no
sign that the virus is present in Hong Kong population at this
time. The DH will maintain intensive surveillance of influenza in
humans. Preliminary findings also show that the virus is sensitive to
antiviral drug, oseltamivir."

The CFS spokesman said: "The sample was taken from a pig imported
from the mainland. We have informed the mainland authorities so that
they can further step up the monitoring and inspection of the
registered farms supplying live pigs to Hong Kong." All imported live
pigs from the mainland come from registered farms and are accompanied
by health certificates issued by the mainland authorities. The Food
and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will also carry out
inspection at the boundary control point. Pigs have to go through
ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection in the slaughterhouses. Only
pigs which pass the inspection can be supplied to the market.

Apart from stepping up inspection of imported live pigs, FEHD has
again reminded slaughterhouse staff and people who might be in
contact with live pigs to pay attention to personal hygiene, and to
wear masks and appropriate protective gear at work. To date over
one-3rd of those involved in pig farming and slaughtering trade have
received the human swine influenza vaccine.

The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department will continue
to inspect and closely monitor the health condition of pigs on local
pig farms. Any pig with clinical signs of swine influenza will be
carefully examined and samples will be taken for diagnosis.

[Unfortunately this press release provides too little specific detail
to enable the information to be evaluated. The precise genotypes of
the swine influenza virus and the putative recombinant are not
revealed, other than to indicate that a swine influenza virus has
picked up an unspecified single genome subunit from the human
pandemic (H1N1) virus. Occasional reassortment of influenza virus
genome subunits is not an unexpected or unusual event; the pandemic
H1N1 virus is itself a multiple reassortant. Unless there is some
selective advantage the reassortants which may be generated during
virus replication never become apparent. We will have to await a
proper description of this event to evaluate its significance. - Mod.CP]
