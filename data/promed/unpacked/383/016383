We have new information Wednesday night [24 Sep 2014] on that outbreak of gastrointestinal illness impacting Durand Schools students. There are now 8 confirmed cases of the campylobacteriosis. More tests are pending, and Pepin County health officials hope to have those results by Thursday morning, 25 Sep 2014.

The infection can be contracted by eating or drinking food or water that has come into some type of contact with fecal matter from either an infected person or an animal. So far more than 50 Durand High School students have been forced to stay home with illness.

The Pepin County Health Department says it will continue to investigate these illnesses.

The Eau Claire Health Department says in the past 5 years the county has reported 15 cases of campylobacteriosis, a bacterial illness that infects your intestinal system. "It is most common for people to get this infection in the summer months," said Jill Bauer, a Public Health Nurse.

"The provider will obtain a stool sample to determine what is causing the symptoms and that's how the illness is diagnosed." Bauer continued to say the infection typically lasts a week.

[Certainly campylobacteriosis is often associated with the ingestion of undercooked chicken and has been the most common cause of infection outbreaks related to unpasteurized milk in the USA in recent years, but waterborne outbreaks from human or animal fecal contamination do occur. Often times, outbreaks related to water are multi factorial in origin.

An epidemiological evaluation of the outbreak comparing ill students and well controls, with regard to food ingestion and water exposures especially, would be helpful.
