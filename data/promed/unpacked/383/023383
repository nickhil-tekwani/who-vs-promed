Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 19 Jan 2016
Date of confirmation of the event: 5 Feb 2016
Report date: 11 Nov 2016
Reason for notification: unexpected change in the distribution or increase in morbidity or mortality of a listed disease
Summary description: since January 2016, an increase in cattle deaths has been reported throughout Belize with bovine rabies being confirmed in 4 of 6 districts.
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Rabies virus
Serotype: RABV
This event pertains to the whole country

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors
Epidemiological comments: Belize usually reports 1-3 confirmed cattle rabies cases per year. In the period 1990-2015, the highest number of confirmed cases per year was reported in 1999 when 9 cases were reported. In 2016, since January an increase of cattle deaths has been reported throughout the country. A total of 19 infected farms have reported 44 cattle deaths with 22 of these deaths being confirmed as positive for rabies. Rabies has been reported in the Corozal, Orange Walk, Cayo, and Toledo Districts. The rabies virus was characterised in Mexico as V-11, vampire bat rabies virus. Cases are ongoing.

Increased distribution:
District / Species
Orange Walk / Cattle
Corozal / Cattle
Cayo / Cattle
Toledo / Cattle

Disease Impact:
Increased / District / Species / Change
Incidence / Corozal / Cattle / 0 => 1
Incidence / Cayo / Cattle / 1 => 5
Incidence / Toledo / Cattle / 0 => 5
Morbidity / Cayo / Cattle / 1 => 5
Morbidity / Toledo / Cattle / 1 => 5
Morbidity / Orange Walk / Cattle / 0 => 1
Mortality / Cayo / Cattle / 1 => 5
Mortality / Toledo / Cattle / 1 => 5
Mortality / Orange Walk / Cattle / 1 => 5

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak(s); quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; control of wildlife reservoirs; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Epidemiological Reference and Diagnosis Institute, Mexico (foreign laboratory) / Cattle / indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test / 4 Nov 2016 / Positive

"Rabies transmitted by the common vampire bat (_Desmodus rotundus_) is a major public health concern in subtropical and tropical areas of Latin America. Infected vampire bats can transmit rabies to domestic mammals and humans through their haematophagous behavior." (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/wildlife_damage/nwrc/publications/12pubs/anderson121.pdf)

The following comment by Mod.TG published in posting 20160311.4084861, is applicable here:
"Vampire bats preferentially prey on livestock. Livestock and horses are generally larger than indigenous wildlife prey species, are more abundant and tend to stay in the same location for extended periods. Once a colony of vampire bats has located a herd of animals, they are then able to return to the same herd on subsequent nights. This is particularly true for cattle.

Humans have also provided vampire bats with roosting sites in the form of buildings, bridges, and wells. This in turn has contributed to an increase in the number and size of vampire bat colonies, and enlarged the population that can act as a reservoir for rabies virus. Deforestation, a consequence of land clearance for logging and modification for agriculture has simultaneously reduced the numbers of natural prey species and brought vampire bats into contact with livestock and man.

Bovine rabies in Latin America is commonly called derriengue, a Spanish word for a fatal paralytic disease. The infected animals exhibit signs of restlessness or excitement with sudden onset of hind limb paralysis. This progresses to the fore limbs. Overt salivation is commonly observed but is believed to be due to difficulties in swallowing rather than excess saliva production. Emaciation in animals that survive for any length of time is observed but the disease is invariably fatal.

There are 3 species of blood feeding or hematophagous bats found exclusively in Latin America. Only one of these, the common vampire bat _Desmodus rotundus_, is a well-known reservoir for rabies.

Vaccination of cattle is a very successful way of preventing rabies in cattle".
