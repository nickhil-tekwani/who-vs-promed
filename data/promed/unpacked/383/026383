Argentina confirms foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. Animals will be
slaughtered
----------------------------------------------------
The National Agrifood Health and Quality Service (SENASA) confirmed last
Friday the presence of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in the
locality of Tartagal, province of Salta (north), and announced that it will
begin to slaughter the affected animals immediately.
The news release states that the sero-epidemiological studies performed in
pigs of the locality of Tartagal, province of Salta, were positive for the
FMD virus and that the lesions observed on the pigs indicate the disease
appeared more than 30 days ago.
The release also notes that currently there are no animals with clinical
signs of acute disease in the area, located close to the border with
Bolivia. The province of Salta is approximately 930 miles north of Buenos
Aires.
An officer of the ministry of agriculture in Brasilia informed that,
following the detection of the outbreak, Brazil decided to suspend all
imports of Argentinean beef. Jamil Gomes, director of the Department of
Animal Defense commented that surveillance measures are being implemented
along the borders.
Last Thursday, in light of the suspected outbreak of FMD, Hipolito Tapie,
director for hygiene of the Cattle Services of Uruguay, announced a
temporary ban on the import of beef from Argentina. Paraguay, which, like
Bolivia, shares the border with the province of Salta, declared a state of
"maximum alert" last Friday, and reinforced the border controls. SENASA
will proceed with the immediate sanitary slaughter of the animals from the
interdicted property and their contacts, in order to comply with the
regulations issued by the OIE, and to be able to recover its status of
'zone free of foot and mouth disease with vaccination' within 180 days.
The affected zone, one of subsistence production, is located within an area
declared under emergency status due to the outbreaks of type O FMD virus
declared in Bolivia and Paraguay last July.
The area is characterized by its low livestock density, mainly with
subsistence producers, whose production is destined for local consumption.
There is no animal movement to other areas of the country, and no
properties are registered for slaughter and export to foreign markets.
On 29 August 2003, pigs with foot lesions compatible with FMD were detected
in the locality of Tartagal, department of San Martin, province of Salta,
approximately 25 miles from the border with Bolivia.
As a result, immediate restrictive and sanitary measures were implemented
in accordance with current regulations, and included restrictions on the
movement of animals, ring vaccination, epidemiological surveillance, and
serological studies, with the appropriate notification to the international
agencies.
In addition zoning of the area was performed, and the departments of San
Martin, Oran, Santa Victoria, Iruya, and Rivadavia will undergo a 90-day
closure. Due to reports of cases of the disease in Paraguay, restrictive
measures continue in the departments of Rivadavia (province of Salta) and
Ramon Lista (province of Formosa, northeast).
Last July, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) declared
Argentina "free of foot and mouth disease with vaccination", since there
were no outbreaks registered in the country for a period of 18 months.
