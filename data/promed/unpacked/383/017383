Pneumonia outbreak prompts bighorn sheep killing
------------------------------------------------
Sharpshooters firing shotguns from a helicopter killed 24 bighorn sheep on Sunday [14 Feb 2016] and Monday [15 Feb 2016] in an unprecedented attempt to contain an outbreak of pneumonia in the herd.

According to the Nevada Department of Wildlife [NDOW] it's the 1st time wildlife managers in the state have taken such drastic measures to prevent the spread of pneumonia among bighorn sheep. The operation took place Sunday and Monday in the Montana Mountains, a remote range in northern Humboldt County near the border with Oregon. "This is truly an unfortunate measure," said Nevada Department of Wildlife director Tony Wasley in a written statement. "But as the extent of this disease event has become clearer to us, we have determined that it is the proper and responsible course of action."

Wildlife officials have been tracking the outbreak since December [2015] when they 1st noticed symptoms in wild, California bighorn sheep in the Montana mountains. Not only did they notice fewer-than-expected sheep during surveys, an indication of unusual mortality, they found sheep with symptoms of advanced stage polymicrobial pneumonia.

The outbreak so far is limited to the Montana and Trout Creek ranges. They are near the Double H Mountains, which contain healthy populations of California bighorn sheep. [See map at source URL.]

When the weather warmed up in recent days and the snowpack began to recede wildlife officials made the decision to act to kill sheep in the Montana range in order to prevent them from infecting neighboring herds. "We have an obligation to take action and try to keep this unfortunate disease event isolated to the Montana mountains," Wasley said. "Quick action now can prevent sick sheep from contacting healthy sheep from the Double H mountains and possibly infecting that herd."

Nevada law allows Wasley, as department director, to direct employees to take wildlife from public land, "in the interest of conserving wildlife." NDOW spokesman Chris Healy said the department did, however, notify the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and Governor Brian Sandoval of the operation in advance.

NDOW hired the USDA Wildlife Services division to conduct the operation. But NDOW biologists will also fly in the area to look for more sheep in the target area. Any that are found will be killed, Healy said. Although Nevada wildlife officials have never before killed sheep to contain a pneumonia outbreak there have been similar operations in other western states. In 2013 officials in Washington killed 63 sheep and in 2010 Utah officials killed 25.

NDOW veterinarian Peregrine Wolff said the strain of pneumonia in the sheep was unique to Nevada and that after inspecting bodies of 10 affected sheep, "I'm surprised some of these animals were still alive."

Bighorn pneumonia is one of the biggest obstacles limiting the comeback of bighorn sheep in the western United States, according to the Bighorn Sheep Disease Research Consortium. Wild sheep contract the disease through contact with domestic sheep and goats that graze in wild sheep habitat, according to the consortium. Once an outbreak starts as many as 90 per cent of an infected herd can die. And birth rates among the survivors can be depressed for years. "In some populations, annual pneumonia outbreaks in lambs continue for decades after the initial infection which prevents the populations from bouncing back," a fact sheet on the consortium's website states. "In other populations, lamb survival returns to normal relatively quickly."

Healy said wildlife officials haven't pinpointed the source of the outbreak. But he acknowledged that researchers generally attribute bighorn pneumonia to contact with domestic livestock. "We're not going to put sheep back into the Montana mountains until we are able to hopefully come up with a stronger protocol so to speak for keeping the wild sheep up on the mountain," Healy said. "The key in all of this is separation. The wild sheep are susceptible to this and we have to figure out a way hopefully to avoid that contact."

[Humboldt County is on the northern border of Nevada with Oregon: see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/nevada_90.jpg and http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/united_states_pol02.jpg. A more detailed map of the shooting area is in the report itself.

In winter the bighorn sheep herds will be restricted to their individually preferred winter grazing areas. But come the spring thaw they will move out. And this disease is becoming more serious with each year, indicating a measure of inter-herd contacts, exchange of _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_ followed by a polymicrobial pneumonia; see 20160109.3923355. It will be interesting to see how effective this area slaughter is. Obviously if we had an effective vaccine and an efficient mode of delivery, the control would be more effective and acceptable. - Mod.MHJ
