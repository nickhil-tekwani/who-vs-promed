A new case of a potentially deadly strain of _E. coli_ has been confirmed in New Brunswick, bringing the total number of people affected in the Maritimes and Ontario to 30. Laboratory results show all of the cases of _E. coli_ O157 are linked and the most likely cause is shredded lettuce distributed by FreshPoint Inc, said Dr Eilish Cleary, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has issued a recall of any remaining affected product, said Cleary.

"Additional cases of illness may be identified and linked to this outbreak in the future," according to an advisory issued by the Public Health Agency of Canada. "The CFIA has traced the lettuce to its origin in California and has notified American authorities," it states. The source of the contamination for the shredded lettuce has not yet been determined.

The lettuce was not distributed to any grocery stores, primarily to some KFC and KFC/Taco Bell restaurants, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. "The CFIA is verifying that appropriate food safety controls were followed at each step of production, processing and distribution. Immediate action will be taken to ensure that any unsafe food is removed from the marketplace."

One week ago [week of 10 Jan 2013], health officials announced the source of the _E. coli_ outbreak in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Ontario was likely lettuce served at KFC/Taco Bell outlets. At that time, they said no new cases were expected. All of the suspect lettuce was being recalled and no new cases had been reported since the holidays, they said. The normal incubation period is 10 days [in some studies as long as 12-13 days. - Mod.LL]

The latest New Brunswick case, a child under the age of 2 in Fredericton, has fully recovered, said Cleary. The 6 previous cases, 2 in the Saint John region and 4 in the Fredericton area, were all between the ages of 17 and 49. One patient had to be hospitalized. Nova Scotia has had 10 confirmed cases of _E. coli_ O157 in the past few weeks, while the total in Ontario has now jumped to 13, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.

[The newer reported cases in this outbreak are newly reported but not clearly new in onset. Contamination of produce can occur at any point in the food chain from field, to market, to table. Among the types of produce associated with outbreaks of EHEC are spinach, various types of sprouts, lettuce, tomatoes, raw or lightly pickled cabbage, strawberries, salad greens, green onions, cantaloupes, and various kinds of nuts. - Mod.LL
