Chilaw regional health authorities have restricted entrance to the
Maradankulama Tank after receiving information from Public Health
Officers in the region about the spread of rat fever [leptospirosis].

A death had already been reported from the region with a few more
residents also said to be showing symptoms of the deadly disease. It
had been reported that crowds were entering the tank to fetch water as
well as collect lotus stems as the region was experiencing a severe
drought.

Chilaw is a western coastal town in Puttalam district, within the
North Western Province of Sri Lanka
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilaw). Maradankulama is a village
located east of Chilaw (see map at
(http://www.maplandia.com/sri-lanka/north-western/maradankulama/).

Sri Lanka is covered with a network of thousands of manmade
reservoirs, known locally as 'tanks', that are part of an ancient
tradition of harvesting and preserving the local rainfall, primarily
for agriculture and drinking water, but also for sacred bathing and
ritual
(http://www.edwardgoldsmith.org/1034/traditional-irrigation-in-the-dry-zone-of-sri-lanka/).
Tank use is especially critical to provide water for irrigation of
agriculture in the dry zone of the island where water supply is
dependent on a cycle of dry seasons alternating with monsoon seasons.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease commonly known as rat fever.
Leptospirosis occurs worldwide and is endemic in Sri Lanka. The
disease is caused by exposure to the spirochetal bacterium
_Leptospira_, in fresh (not salty) water, wet soil, or vegetation that
has been contaminated by urine of animals chronically infected with
one of the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira
interrogans_. Rodents, dogs, cattle, and pigs are the usual reservoirs
for this organism.

Leptospirosis frequently occurs during periods of flooding after heavy
rains; but in the instance reported in the news release above, when
leptospirosis is occurring during a period of severe drought, this
disease is being attributed due to exposure to
_Leptospira_-contaminated water in the "tanks". However, how the
diagnosis was made is not mentioned in the news release. Because of
the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of
leptospirosis, the diagnosis of leptospirosis cannot be made
confidently without laboratory confirmation. - Mod.ML]
