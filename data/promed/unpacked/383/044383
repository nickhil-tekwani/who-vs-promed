--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this 4th monthly update of our living review (1), we searched MEDLINE (Ovid) weekly from [4 to 31 Aug 2020] using the same search strategy as described in the original review. We did not limit the search by language. This search update yielded 82 results (de-duplicated), and after an independent dual-review process, we identified 24 new studies meeting our inclusion criteria -- 19 observational studies, 4 meta-analyses, and 1 systematic review (2-25).

New evidence
------------
Findings from the 19 observational studies are overall consistent with prior evidence that found a lack of association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) use and more severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (2-20). Several studies suggest that use of ACEIs or ARBs before developing COVID-19 may be associated with improved outcomes (3,4,7,11,12).

Two meta-analyses addressed our 1st key question about use of ACEIs and ARBs and COVID-19 risk, finding that neither ACEI nor ARB use is significantly associated with the odds of COVID-19 disease (22,24). 3 meta-analyses addressed our 2nd key question about ACEI and ARB use and COVID-19 disease severity, finding that use of these medications was not associated with the risk for more severe disease (21-23).

Overall, inclusion of 24 studies from this search update does not change the certainty of evidence rating we reported in the original manuscript for key questions 1 or 2. Studies have not examined the benefits and harms of initiating ACEIs and ARBs (that is, new users) in COVID-19 treatment; therefore, evidence for key question 3 remains unclear.

[2] WHO vaccine distribution plan
Date: Mon 21 Sep 2020 3:25 PM
Source: Science, American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) [edited]
https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/who-unveils-global-plan-fairly-distribute-covid-19-vaccine-challenges-await


The World Health Organization (WHO) announced today [21 Sep 2020] that countries representing close to two-thirds of the world's population have joined its plan to buy and fairly distribute COVID-19 vaccines around the globe. It also unveiled the mechanism through which it plans to allocate the vaccine as it becomes available, aiming "to end the acute phase of the pandemic by the end of 2021."

"It is a huge success to have equivalent to 64% of the world's population signed up," Alexandra Phelan, a lawyer at Georgetown University who specializes in global health policy, wrote in an email. "However, this doesn't reflect the deeply unequal power dynamics in global health and vaccine manufacturing capabilities that may still challenge equitable access to vaccines." China and the United States are notably absent from WHO's list of partners in the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility, she and other observers noted.

With nearly 1 million deaths reported worldwide from COVID-19, and the Northern Hemisphere heading into its 1st winter in the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 still has the world in its grip. WHO has pushed countries to sign up for a plan that will buy a vaccine in huge quantities and distribute it in an equitable way. But it has been grappling with 2 big issues: how to get high-income countries to join, instead of hoarding early vaccine supplies for their own populations; and how to share the vaccine in a fair way once it becomes available.

"As of today, 64 higher income countries, including 29 economies operating as Team Europe, have submitted legally binding commitments to join the COVAX Facility," Seth Berkley, head of GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, said at the press conference. An additional 38 countries are expected to sign soon, he said. These countries will have access to the vaccines in the COVAX portfolio and will pay for their own doses. Lower income countries that have joined COVAX will have vaccine doses purchased for them; there are 92 such signers.

The list of high-income countries that have joined includes Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and Peru. But "The fact that the US is not part of this conversation at all, as far as I can tell, is incredibly distressing," says Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's School of Public Health. Asked about China's absence, Berkley said the goal is to work with every country in the world. "I can assure you that we have had conversations and will continue to have conversations with all countries," he said.

Many questions remain about how the COVAX Facility will work. So far, just USD 700 million has been raised to pay for the vaccine in lower income countries, short of the USD 2 billion thought to be needed by the end of the year [2021?]. And it is not clear how the deals many countries already have made directly with vaccine manufacturers will impact WHO's plans. "I think the big question for COVAX, and the thing that will determine whether COVAX can really deliver on its vision, is to what extent those domestic deals that are being done by rich countries mean that they won't need COVAX so much themselves, and therefore might not provide sufficient financing for the non-self-financing countries," says Alex Harris of the Wellcome Trust.

In an ideal world, there would be no such bilateral deals, says WHO's Mariangela Simao, "but that's not how it works." And negotiations on many of those deals were already underway when COVAX was being set up, she says. As a result, such deals "are a danger in a way" to the plan.

WHO's "fair allocation mechanism" proposes distributing vaccine in 2 phases. In the 1st phase, all countries would receive vaccine proportional to their population; initially enough vaccine to immunize 3% of their population, with the 1st doses going to frontline workers in health care and social care. Then, additional vaccine would be delivered until 20% of a nation's population is covered. WHO envisages that these doses would be used to immunize those at the highest risk from COVID-19: elderly people and those with comorbidities.

In the 2nd phase, vaccine to cover additional people would be delivered to countries based on how urgently immunizations are needed. The framework suggests 2 criteria should be used to decide priority:
- how fast the virus is spreading (the effective reproduction number) and whether other pathogens such as influenza or measles are spreading at the same time; and
- how vulnerable a country's health system is, based on metrics such as the occupancy of beds in hospitals and intensive care units.

Ezekiel Emanuel, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, criticized WHO's approach in the 1st phase. Countries with the biggest need should be at the top of the list from the start, he says. He compares the situation to a doctor facing an overflowing emergency room. "The doctor doesn't go out into the waiting room and say: 'I'm giving 3 minutes to everybody sitting in the waiting room.' The doctor says: 'All right, who's got the most serious illness? ... I'm going to attend to you first.'" At the moment, he notes, sending vaccine to South Korea, New Zealand, or many African countries would not do much to reduce deaths from COVID-19 because these nations have low case rates; he says the vaccine could be put to better use elsewhere.

But WHO's Bruce Aylward notes new outbreaks can suddenly pop up in new places. "Remember, we are dealing with a ubiquitous threat (the virus) and ubiquitous vulnerability (highly susceptible high-risk populations)!" Aylward wrote. "Hence you go for rapid risk reduction as [the] first step."

Allocating some vaccine to every participating country in the beginning may have been necessary politically, Jha says. "I think [WHO is] probably balancing between trying to get enough people protected, and trying to create enough of a sense of buy-in that people are going to be willing to chip in." Emanuel says he understands WHO's position, "But we shouldn't confuse politics with ethics."

There are numerous caveats to WHO's plan, most importantly that the framework was written without knowing the characteristics of whatever vaccine first becomes available. The mechanism is based on "the current working assumption for a vaccine with a broad safety and effectiveness profile," WHO says. If the 1st available vaccine turns out to be much better at protecting young people than elderly people, for instance, a different strategy might be needed. "I have 40 years of public health and [helping draft the plan] is definitely the biggest challenge I ever faced," Simao says. All kinds of models and calculations were used but there is a huge amount of uncertainty, she says, noting the document is called a "final working version." Until more is known, she says, "this is as good as it gets."

The plan faces other risks. For example, countries could decide to use export controls or other means to restrict vaccine supplies and deny them to COVAX, Phelan says. "We still need global commitment to set the norms of unacceptable conduct during vaccine distribution," she says, "including discriminatory distribution within countries." But there is also the opportunity that this mechanism, patched together as the world scrambles to fight a pandemic, becomes a norm for future pandemics, she says. "As the [WHO] director-general has noted, we need to be preparing for the next pandemic now, in addition to responding to COVID."

The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 am CEST, 20 Sep 2020

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
To date [21 Sep 2020], over 30.6 million COVID-19 cases and 950 000 deaths have been reported to WHO. From [14 through 20 Sep 2020], there were almost 2 million new cases of COVID-19, which represents a 6% increase compared to the previous week, and the highest number of reported cases in a single week since the beginning of the epidemic. During the same period, there was a 10% decrease in the number of deaths, with 37 700 deaths reported in the past 7 days (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases reported weekly by WHO Region, and global deaths, [30 Dec 2019] through [20 Sep 2020]

With the exception of the African Region, an increase in the weekly case incidence was reported across all WHO regions in the last 7 days (Table 1, Figure 2). Overall, the Region of the Americas continues to carry the highest burden of COVID-19 globally, accounting for over 38% of all new cases reported in the past 7 days, although the region has reported a 22% decrease in new deaths. The WHO European Region showed the greatest rise in deaths in the past week, with a 27% increase compared to the previous week.

Figure 2: COVID-19 cases per million population reported in the last 7 days by countries, territories and areas, 14 through [20 Sep 2020]

The WHO South-East Asia Region has continued to report an increase in new COVID-19 deaths, with over 9000 deaths in the past week, accounting for 25% of all reported deaths and surpassing 100 000 total COVID-19 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. In addition, the region accounts for 35% of new cases reported in the past week. The Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific regions have both reported a slight increase in reported cases and deaths over the last 3 weeks. The African Region continues to show a marked decline with decreases of 12% and 16% in reported cases and deaths respectively in the past week.

Situation by WHO region
-----------------------
- African Region
For the last 6 weeks, the African Region has continued to report a decrease in both COVID-19 cases and deaths. During the past week, 33 of the 49 affected countries reported either a decrease in deaths or no deaths. The region has reported almost 25 000 cumulative deaths to date, of which South Africa accounts for 15 900 (64%). South Africa continues to report the highest number of new cases and new deaths, followed by Ethiopia, Algeria, and Mozambique. Notably, 35 of 49 affected countries/territories/areas in the Region continue to report ongoing community transmission.

Figure 3: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO African Region, as of [20 Sep 2020]

- Region of the Americas
The Region of the Americas remains the most affected WHO Region, accounting for 50% of all reported cases and 55% of deaths. Even though the Region has reported an increase of 10% in the number of new cases in the past week, it also accounts for the largest decrease in deaths compared to the previous 7 days (-22%) (Figure 4).

Figure 4: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Region of the Americas, as of [20 Sep 2020]). 32 out of the 48 affected countries and territories in the Region report community transmission, while only 8 report sporadic transmission.

The countries reporting the highest numbers of new cases in the past week include the United States of America, Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia. The number of daily cases reported in Ecuador has remained relatively high, with an average of more than 500 cases reported daily in September [2020].

The marked decrease in the number of deaths in the Region has been driven mainly by a decrease in Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, and Bolivia in the past 7 days, while the United States of America and Brazil continue to report the highest number of deaths, each reporting over 5000 new deaths in the past week.

While Argentina was one of the countries in the Americas with the lowest incidence of cases and deaths during the 1st few months of the pandemic, over the last few months the weekly incidence of cases has been rising rapidly, and test positivity rates have exceeded 40% in recent weeks.

- Eastern Mediterranean Region
The number of cases and deaths reported in the Eastern Mediterranean Region have consistently increased over the last 3 weeks (Figure 5), and have increased by 8% and 14% respectively in the last 7 days. The highest numbers of new cases were reported by Iraq, Iran, and Morocco. Jordan, Oman and Tunisia reported the greatest relative increase in cases compared to the previous week. While Iran reported the highest number of new deaths, Tunisia and Afghanistan reported the greatest increase in deaths compared to the previous week.

Figure 5: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, as of [20 Sep 2020].

- European Region
The number of cases and deaths reported in the European Region increased by 11% and 27% respectively in the past 7 days (Figure 6), with France, the Russian Federation, Spain, and the United Kingdom reporting the highest numbers of new cases in the past week. Iceland and Cyprus have reported the greatest percentage increase in new cases in the past week.

The Region has been experiencing a slight increase in the number of reported deaths over the past 4 weeks, reaching over 4000 new deaths in the past 7 days. Hungary and Denmark reported the highest relative increase in deaths in the past week, while the United Kingdom continues to report the highest number of cumulative deaths, with almost 42 000.

Figure 6: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO European Region, as of [20 Sept 2020].

- South East Asia Region
The South-East Asia Region is the 2nd most affected Region and currently accounts for 35% and 25% of cases and deaths, respectively, newly reported globally in the past 7 days. Although the number of cases and deaths has been increasing steadily since March [2020], the increases have slowed, with increases in new cases and deaths of only 1% and 4% respectively in the past week. The countries reporting the highest number of new cases continue to be India, Indonesia, and Bangladesh, while Myanmar and Nepal showed the highest increase in new cases in the past 7 days.

The countries reporting the highest number of new deaths per million population include India and Maldives, with 6 and 4 deaths per million population respectively, while Myanmar continues to show the highest increase in deaths in the past week.

Figure 7: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO South-East Asia Region, as of [20 Sep 2020]

- Western Pacific Region
Overall, the Western Pacific Region continues to show the lowest cumulative cases, accounting for less than 2% of global cases and less than 1.5% of all deaths. The Philippines and Japan accounted for the greatest number of new cases and new deaths in the Region. Relative increases in the number of deaths were reported in Malaysia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea (Figure 8).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory for 21 Sep 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesSept21%20(2)_1600815155.pdf. The tables have been modified to include countries and territories that are in the region but have not reported any cases to date.

- The Americas region reported 41.8% of daily case numbers and 54.0% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 15.5 million cases.

- The European region reported 14.3% of daily case numbers and 7.7% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 5.2 million. Countries not reporting cases today (21 Sep 2020) include Spain, Israel, Sweden, Portugal, and Switzerland.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.2% of daily case numbers and 8.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.2 million cases.

- The African region reported 1.6% of daily case numbers and 1.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.1 million cases.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.5% of daily case numbers and 1.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.58 million cases.

- The South East Asia region reported 34.6% of the daily newly reported cases and 27.5% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 6.1 million cases.

Today's report from Europe has weekend reporting artifact with key countries not reporting new cases in the past 24 hours.

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India now in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (74 493), followed by the USA (41 448) and Brazil (15 454) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.5%) and 52.1% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 4253 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (20-21 Sep 2020). The decreases in 24-hour new case reports along with the lower 24-hour reported deaths in these 3 countries are possibly consistent with the previously seen pattern of weekend reporting artifacts.

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Spain (12 134), Peru (10 031), Argentina (8782), Russia (6196), Colombia (5359), and France (5298); 30 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. 7 of the 20 top countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the Americas region and 8 of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the European region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 4.5%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 2.2%.

Impression: Cases are increasing globally, with Europe and the Americas showing major increasing transmission in many countries. Numbers appear to be decreasing in the past 24 hours most likely a continued reduction in reporting over the weekend. - Mod.MPP]
