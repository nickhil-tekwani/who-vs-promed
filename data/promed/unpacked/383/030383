Scientists at CSIRO's Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) and the
Queensland Department of Primary Industries (QDPI) took part in an
international effort to help control the outbreak.
CSIRO research to be presented today at the 11th International Congress of
Virology, in Sydney, has shown that the virus is present in nasal mucous and
saliva of pigs with the disease.
"Our research into transmission of the virus shows that farm workers who
became ill may have breathed in or ingested fine particles coughed up by
Nipah infected pigs, which carried the virus," says CSIRO Animal Health
Veterinary Scientist, Dr Deborah Middleton.
"The result is important, as it tells us that people involved in any future
outbreaks should wear breathing masks to avoid infections."
The research also demonstrates that cats can be infected, and that the virus
is present in their urine and mouth fluids.
Dr Middleton says that the Australian research also provides proof that the
disease in pigs is caused by the same agent as the disease in humans.
"This confirms that the strategy of culling pigs was needed to stop human
infections," Dr Middleton says.
The researchers drew on work done in Australia on the related Hendra virus
to find out where the virus came from. The Hendra virus has killed two
people and sixteen horses in Australia since 1994.
QDPI's Dr Hume Field worked in Malaysia during the outbreak for six weeks,
looking for the natural 'host' of the virus. Samples were taken from a range
of species, including wild boar, rodents, shrews, squirrels and bats.
In Dr Field's survey of over 300 Malaysian bats, CSIRO testing found twenty
animals within 4 species of fruit bat had antibodies to Nipah virus. This
means that they had been infected with the virus and their immune systems
had mounted a defence against it. No other wild-life species had antibodies
to the virus.
In a paper to be presented to the Congress on Wednesday 11 August, CSIRO
Animal Health's Dr Bryan Eaton will review the evidence for the connection
with bats for the two diseases, and discuss genetic differences in the
viruses of between 20 to 60 per cent.

Other papers:
------------------
Dr Middleton will present a paper on 'Experimental Transmission of Nipah
Virus Infection to Pigs and Cats'.
CSIRO Animal Health's Dr Bryan Eaton will present a paper on 'Hendra, Nipah
and Menangle viruses: three new zoonotic members of the family
Paramyxoviridae' .
CSIRO Animal Health's Dr Peter Daniels and Dr Alex Hyatt will present
posters at the Conference on aspects of Nipah disease in animals, in
conjunction with sessions on emerging infectious diseases. Dr Hume Field, Dr
Johara Mojd Yob, Dr Paul Selleck and Mr Chris Morissy will also present a
poster on 'Surveillance of wildlife for evidence of infection with Nipah
virus'.
