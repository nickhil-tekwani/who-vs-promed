DNR explores 13 deer deaths
---------------------------
Early indications are that the deaths of 13 deer in north east Otter Tail
County don't appear to be linked to chronic wasting disease, a Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources (DNR) spokesman said.
The DNR received a report last week from 2 landowners southwest of Menahga
that 12 deer had died in a concentrated area, said DNR regional wildlife
supervisor John Breyen of Bemidji. Those deer had decomposed too badly to
be tested for a cause of death, but one more deer died and the DNR removed
its head and sent it to the University of Minnesota to be tested for
chronic wasting disease (CWD).
The landowners who contacted the DNR about the deer said the animals had
been emaciated before they died. But Breyen said a couple of factors
suggested that the deer did not have CWD, an infectious disease that
attacks the brains of deer and elk. The deer were anemic, which can be one
sign of CWD, but they also exhibited other signs not consistent with the
disease such as black, runny droppings, Breyen said. Also, all the deer
were found in a small area, which would not necessarily be consistent with
CWD, Breyen said.
Because the deer all died in such a limited area, Breyen theorized they
could have eaten some tainted food such as moldy corn. "It was a very, very
isolated area," Breyen said. "That leads us to believe it was something
they got into."
The DNR will collect more deer from the area for testing, Breyen said. DNR
personnel from Detroit Lakes and Park Rapids were in the area Tuesday night
hoping to shoot some animals, and several landowners have been authorized
to do the same. Breyen said the DNR would like to collect 5 deer, but 2 or
3 would be sufficient.
The entire carcasses of those deer will be sent to the University of
Minnesota for necropsies. CWD has been at the forefront of DNR testing
efforts for the past couple of years, ever since the disease was found in a
single captive elk on a farm near Aitkin. The disease has never been found
in the state's wild deer population.
In the fall of 2003, the DNR tested nearly 10 000 deer harvested by
hunters. No positive tests were found. The test sample included 328 deer
taken from hunting Zone 411, which is adjacent to the area in Otter Tail
County in which the 13 dead deer were found.
Typical signs of CWD include drooping head or ears, poor body condition,
tremors, stumbling, increased salivation, difficulty swallowing or
excessive thirst or urination, according to the DNR website.

[This many deer in an apparently small areas does not seem to be CWD, and
it seems it is too early in the season for epizootic hemorrhagic disease. ­
