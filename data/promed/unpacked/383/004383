Killer virus back after 30 years
--------------------------------------
A deadly mosquito-borne disease has been detected in northern
Victoria for the 1st time in more than 30 years. Health officials
have warned people at Kerang to avoid mosquito bites.

Murray Valley encephalitis virus has been detected in chickens, which
were placed in the area as a monitor for the disease. Chief health
officer John Carnie said the risk of human illness was low. "It is
still important for people to avoid mosquitoes whenever possible," Dr
Carnie said. This includes wearing long, loose-fitting clothing, and
using repellent.

Dr Carnie said householders should check that insect screens on doors
and windows are in good condition. He also said mosquito numbers
could be cut back by removing stagnant water, such as that in old
tyres, unused fish ponds, and pot plant holders.

Symptoms of the disease include severe headache, high fever,
drowsiness, tremors, and seizures. Dr Carnie said people experiencing
such symptoms should seek urgent medical attention.

The last outbreak in Victoria was in 1974, when 9 people died after
it spread across southeastern Australia. Flocks of chickens were
placed at 10 locations around the Murray River after 1974 as an early
warning system. Infected chickens suffer no ill health because of the
virus, Dr Carnie said.

[Murray Valley encephalitis occurs as a zoonosis in Australia and New
Guinea. Murray Valley encephalitis virus is believed to be maintained
in a natural cycle involving water birds and mosquitoes. It is a
flavivirus closely related to Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile
virus, and St Louis encephalitis virus. The clinical presentation is
similar; fever, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting. There are often early
signs of CNS (central nervous system) involvement and patients who
progress to coma generally have a poor outcome developing respiratory
paralysis followed by neck, limb, and speech impairment. Fatalities
may occur as the result of brain damage or secondary infection. The
inapparent to apparent infection ratio is about 500:1, and the case
fatality rate is about 20 per cent.
