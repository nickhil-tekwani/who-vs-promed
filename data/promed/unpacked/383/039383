A case of anthrax was detected in 2 cattle in the commune of Langatte on Thursday [25 Jul 2019]. The disease primarily affects animals but can be transmitted to humans through contact or ingestion of infected animals. The farm concerned was put under observation pending the vaccination of the animals.

Return of an epidemic?
----------------------
In 2016, an intense episode of anthrax hit Moselle. A total of 8 outbreaks were detected in the Sarrebourg sector [in the Langatte commune]. An animal vaccination campaign was carried out in 15 communes to protect the farms [see 8 Jul 2017 Anthrax - France (02): (Moselle) bovine 20170708.5160530].

The prefecture of Moselle reminds people that it is important to vaccinate the animals before putting in the grass. The vaccine can be obtained from veterinary practices.

[Langatte is in the northeast corner of France, close to the border with Germany; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langatte.

The report on the 2016 series of outbreaks was published in July 2017, and closely matches the wording in this report. This 2019 outbreak probably reflects a re-emergence of spores from one of the cattle graves. The very hot weather in France at this time will have negatively affected the natural resistance of livestock to infection, and a low dose of spores would be adequate to initiate a lethal infection. - Mod.MHJ
