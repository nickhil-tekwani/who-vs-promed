Malaysia: Upsurge of Cases in Selangor
--------------------------------------
Coffee shop talk has it that people are falling ill from dengue. Yes, and
the authorities' verdict is: it's alarming! But don't just talk about it
and do nothing. Go home now and check all the receptacles in your premises
to ensure they are free from mosquito larvae. Check your surroundings, too.
Making sure there are no breeding grounds for the dreaded _Aedes_ mosquito
is the best way to deal with the epidemic. Householders are warned that
more checks are being carried out at homes, and those found with mosquito
larvae in their premises will be fined MYR 500 [USD 131]. If the offence is
serious enough, the fine can go as high as MYR 50 000 [USD 13 165] or a
maximum of five year's jail, or both.
Yesterday, Selangor health chairman Datuk Tang See Hang gave some shocking
statistics; up till 6 Jul 2002, there have been 3156 dengue fever cases in
Selangor. So far 5 people have died from the disease, which is spread by
the _Aedes_ mosquito, which loves to breed in clean water. Of the 5, one
was from Taman Sri Serdang (Subang Jaya municipality), another from Section
27 of Shah Alam and 3 from the Selayang municipality - Kampung Sungai Bakap
and Bandar Country Homes in Rawang and Bukit Lagong in Sungai Buloh.
"There has been a 38 percent increase in the total number of cases so far
this year compared to the same period last year," he said. Most of the
cases were dengue fever while 183 cases were the more deadly form, dengue
haemorrhagic fever. From 30 Jun to 6 Jul 2002, there were 198 reports
statewide compared to 224 reports the week before, which was the highest
weekly figure so far this year. Of the total number of reports until now,
1222 cases or 38.7 percent of them were confirmed cases.
Tang revealed that of the 7 municipalities in the State, Selayang has the
highest number of cases at 711. The others are: Subang Jaya (506 cases),
Shah Alam (488), Petaling Jaya (334), Klang (226), Kajang (199) and Ampang
Jaya (193). [Control] measures being taken include fogging at all areas
where cases were reported, eliminating breeding spots, [destroying] _Aedes_
larvae and deploying residents to get involved in clean-ups. He said the
Government provides free fogging service and warned them that some pest
controllers were offering this service for a fee. "We provide free fogging,
usually in the mornings and late afternoons. These pay-per-fog operators
usually do it at noon. Don't deal with them." So far 10 stop-work orders
have been issued against construction sites; 8 by the Shah Alam City
Council and 2 by the Petaling District Health Office.

Honduras: More Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Deaths predicted
--------------------------------------------------------
TEGUCIGALPA: Yesterday the government of Honduras announced that the number
of deaths due to dengue [hemorrhagic] fever in the past 6 months may
increase to 23. The official reports indicate that [as of Mon 15 Jul 2002]
the disease has been responsible for 9 deaths. The Minister of Health,
Elias Lizardo, pointed out that they are presently investigating another 14
deaths to determine if they were also due to dengue hemorrhagic fever.
This epidemic began on 6 Feb 2002 with the death of a 5-year-old child from
La Ermita, which is located 60 km to the north of Tegucigalpa. According to
official data, [as of Mon 15 Jul 2002] there have been more than 6262 cases
of classical dengue fever and 545 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever
identified in the country. The principal population affected by the disease
are children and youngsters, ages 5-14 years, residing in 18 provinces in
Honduras.
The data that the health authorities have presented show that the majority
of the deaths have occurred in Tegucigalpa and surrounding areas, where the
health authorities have placed an epidemiologic cordon in order to prevent
further spread of the disease. "The situation is difficult... and the
population should collaborate to eradicate the disease, eliminate mosquito
breeding sites from their houses and yards. If th latter isn't done, the
eggs of the insect will persist and nothing that the government does
through fumigation of houses will eliminate the vector." the minister
pointed out.
With the arrival of the rainy season in the end of May, the Government
mobilized a large number of brigades with instructions to eliminate
standing water where the _Aedes agypti_ mosquito (the vector that transmits
the disease) breeds.

Taiwan: Southern Taiwan Experiencing Major Outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
Health officials say this year's outbreak of the [potentially] lethal
disease is more serious than previous years' and there still is no vaccine
for it. Southern Taiwan is experiencing a major outbreak of dengue fever,
with an average of 10 confirmed cases reported every day, the Center for
Disease Control (CDC) said yesterday. As of yesterday afternoon, the CDC
had confirmed 283 cases, including 202 in Kaohsiung City, 80 in Kaohsiung
County, and one in Taipei County.
Kaohiung's Chienchen and Fengshan districts are where the majority of cases
of the mosquito-borne virus have been reported. The CDC says 3 of the cases
have been confirmed as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), the more severe form
of the disease. DHF can be fatal if not recognized and treated properly.
Compared to the last few years, this year's outbreak of dengue fever
developed rapidly between June and July, especially in the Kaohsiung
region," CDC Deputy Director-General Chiang Ying-lung said yesterday. Last
year there were 201 dengue cases reported in Kaohsiung City.
"Reasons for this year's serious outbreak are complicated," Chiang said.
"The rapid rise in temperature and the frequent rain showers in the
southern part of Taiwan could be major factors. Moreover, people tend to
ignore the seriousness [of the disease] and stop cleaning their houses to
eliminate mosquito eggs and larvae since there has been no major outbreak
for the past 3 to 4 years," he added.
In an effort to stop the spread of the disease, a cleaning effort launched
by the local health bureaus in the Kaohsiung area continued over the
weekend. Disinfectants have been sprayed to reduce the mosquito population
and containers or other items that can retain water or collect rainwater
have been thrown out. The CDC also announced that anyone failing to clean
up their household to eliminate possible mosquito-breeding areas could face
fines up to TWD $150 000 [USD 4525]. People who refuse to cooperate with
the local health bureaus or hinder the public clean-up efforts could be
fined up to TWD $300 000 [USD 9050].
Dengue fever is caused by one of four closely related, but distinct, virus
serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN), which are transmitted to humans by
the bite of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which feeds during the day. It
can't be spread directly from person to person. Symptoms of dengue fever
include a high fever, severe headache, backache, joint pain, nausea, and
rash. The incubation period for dengue fever is 3 to 14 days. There is no
vaccine against the disease, nor any specific treatment for it. People with
dengue fever are normally treated with pain relievers containing
acetaminophen or in more serious cases, with fluid-replacement therapy.
