BOTULISM, CANNED FOOD: AEROSOL RISK

Could you comment in the digest on how great is the risk from
exposure to botulinum toxin via the skin, mucous membranes, or
inhalation in a situation with contaminated food? It strikes me that
all or just about all cases of intoxication occur following ingestion.

[Indeed, as Dr Gould states, just about all cases of botulism occur
following ingestion but aerosolization of toxin can occur if a can,
in which _Clostridium botulinum_ is replicating, explodes from
internal pressure related to gas formation. The risk of acquisition
of clinical botulism after an aerosol exposure is not entirely clear
but...
As an example of what might occur, in the early 1960s (1,2), as part
of the German biowarfare program, the laboratory workers exposed
rabbits and guinea pigs to aerosolized botulinum toxin type A. The
animals were enclosed in hermetically sealed containers during the
exposures and the workers wore "completely protective clothing."
Following the exposures, the animals were transferred to other
enclosures and later examinations were made by the workers with only
protective gloves.
By the 3rd day after the exposures, the workers developed pooling of
secretions in the mouth, an influenza-like feeling, and some
dysphagia to solids. The next day, increased weakness, difficulties
with gait and speech, and oculomotor pareses were noted. All 3 were
treated with botulinum antitoxin. Subsequently, they had slow
recoveries and their serum was shown to contain type A toxin in a
mouse assay.
Aerosolization botulism has also been studied in primates (3).
Overall, however, it was estimated that a point-source aerosol
release of botulinum toxin could incapacitate or kill 10 percent of
persons within 0.5 km (0.3 mi) downwind (4).
