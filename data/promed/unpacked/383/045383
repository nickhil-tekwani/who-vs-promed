_Sarocladium kiliense_ fungemia outbreak in Chile
-------------------------------------------------
On 14 Jan 2014, the Public Health Institute of Chile reported contamination by _Sarocladium kiliense_ of the pharmaceutical product Ondansetron IV, in relation to an outbreak of infections in pediatric oncology patients from different centers throughout the country. This drug is produced by the Colombian laboratory Vitrofarma.

The 1st cases of infection by _S. kiliense_ were detected in June 2013 in children treated for onco-hematological diseases. The organism was isolated in blood cultures from peripheral blood and central catheter. Most patients had no episode of neutropenia during fungemia.

The epidemiological [investigation] was able to detect the presence of this fungus in blood cultures from 41 onco-hematologic patients [undergoing] chemotherapy, with central catheters, [whether] febrile or [not]. The study included the search for [_S. kiliense_] in pharmacological products common to all patients included in the outbreak, which resulted in growth of _S. kiliense_ in Ondansetron IV vials produced by Vitrofarma laboratory and imported into Chile by Labvitalis SA.

The management of patients has included the removal of central venous catheters (CVC) and antifungal treatment with amphotericin B (deoxycholate or liposomal) or voriconazole for 10 to 14 days, with good clinical response. 5 patients showed infection in other organs (lungs and sinuses). A patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia, who relapsed, died due to leukemia and infectious complications, which could not be attributed to _S. kiliense_.

The Chilean health authority has banned the use of the drug product and initiated an investigation. The detection of some new cases is still to be expected.

_S. kiliense_ ([formerly known as] _Acremonium kiliense_) is an environmental fungus. There are few case reports in the literature, mainly affecting immunocompromised patients and producing osteomyelitis, sepsis, endophthalmitis, endocarditis, arthritis, and infections associated with peritoneal dialysis. Outbreaks have also been described in cancer patients with CVC, one of them related to parenteral nutrition.

[The report above describes an outbreak of fungemia due to _Sarocladium kiliense_ in pediatric oncology patients from different centers throughout Chile as a consequence of contamination of an intravenously administered drug, ondansetron, with _S. kiliense_.

Ondansetron, originally marketed under the brand name Zofran, is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist available for oral and intravenous administration to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. Ondansetron can cause a prolongation of the QT interval, which can lead to the potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia known as Torsade de Pointes. The US FDA approved generic versions of ondansetron in December 2006.

_Sarocladium_ are filamentous fungi with characteristic morphology on growth in vitro that are found in plant material and soil. The genus is important for its production of antibiotics such as cephalosporins. _S. kiliense_ has been responsible for local and systemic fungal infection (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3122737/): _S. kiliense_ can cause localized forms of infection such as keratitis, endophthalmitis, mycetoma, onychomycosis, or cutaneous infections in immunocompetent individuals; and in severely immunocompromised patients, fungemia, and disseminated infections involving multiple organs can occur. The diagnosis can be confirmed by culturing the organism from blood or other fluids, or by a tissue biopsy. It has been found to be susceptible to the anti-fungal drugs voriconazole and posaconazole, but some isolates may be resistant to amphotericin B, fluconazole, 5-fluorocytosine, and caspofungin (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3122737/).

How contamination of intravenous ondansetron occurred is as yet unknown and the investigation continues. The drug was manufactured by Vitrofarma SA, a "Colombian assembly company, ...[that] specializes in the production of sterile injectable drugs [for human and veterinarian use]" (http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://www.vitrofarma.com/&prev=/search?q%3DVitrofarma%26biw%3D1211%26bih%3D614). If ondansetron was "assembled" by Vitrofarma from various components, were the components previously contaminated elsewhere and if so, where did the components originate?

The authors anticipate that there may be some additional cases. ProMED-mail awaits further information about the extent of this outbreak and the source and mode of the contamination. Information on this matter from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.ML
