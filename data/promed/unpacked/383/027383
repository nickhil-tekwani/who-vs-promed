Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) outbreak has claimed lives of 5 children in Muzaffarpur district of Bihar. 15 others are undergoing treatment in hospitals there, said Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Dr Gyan Bhushan. "Two children succumbed to the disease today. The 1st death this year was recorded on 28 May 2015, and the toll went up to 5 since then. Altogether 15 children are undergoing treatment at the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU)," he said.

Bhushan said of the 15 children with AES symptoms, 14 are admitted at Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) and Kejriwal Hospital in Muzaffarpur city. "AES outbreak has been reported in East Champaran, Sitamarhi, Sheohar and Muzaffarpur districts and the ailing children have been brought to Muzaffarpur, as specialised treatment is available here," he added. The civil surgeon also said that efforts are being made to identify patients at primary health centre (PHC) level in rural areas and ensure that they receive medical attention immediately so that the fatality could come down.

Meanwhile, Bihar health minister Ramdhani Singh asserted that the state government has taken several measures, and is ready to tackle the disease in 2015. "We have held workshops and training on AES for doctors. Since Muzaffarpur is the centre of the disease, we have deployed doctors and medical personnel in enough numbers there. Medicines have been made available in required quantity. The disease is not expected to spread much this year," Singh told PTI.

The health minister also added that the state government has provided enough ambulances in the feeder areas or the areas from which patients come, so that they are taken to hospitals without any delay. Doctors are of the view that immediate medical attention improves the chances of survival of children suffering from AES.

[Information on acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in India can be found in the following publications, 1 of which points to the possibility of litchee nuts as the causative factor, as the cases in that situation coincided with the month-long litchi harvesting season late May to early June; and another which examines infectious etiologies which coincide with the summer season with high densities of vector mosquitoes.

Shrivastava A, Srikantiah P, Kumar A, et al. Outbreaks of unexplained neurologic illness - Muzaffarpur, India, 2013-2014. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2015 Jan 30;64(3):49-53.

"Abstract. Outbreaks of an unexplained acute neurologic illness affecting young children and associated with high case fatality rates have been reported in the Muzaffarpur district of Bihar state in India since 1995. The outbreaks generally peak in June and decline weeks later with the onset of monsoon rains. There have been multiple epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of this syndrome, leading to a wide spectrum of proposed causes for the illness, including infectious encephalitis and exposure to pesticides. An association between illness and litchi fruit has been postulated because Muzaffarpur is a litchi fruit-producing region. To better characterize clinical and epidemiologic features of the illness that might suggest its cause and how it can be prevented, the Indian National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and CDC investigated outbreaks in 2013 and 2014. Clinical and laboratory findings in 2013 suggested a noninflammatory encephalopathy, possibly caused by a toxin. A common laboratory finding was low blood glucose (under 70 mg/dL) on admission, a finding associated with a poorer outcome; 44 per cent of all cases were fatal. An ongoing 2014 investigation has found no evidence of any infectious etiology and supports the possibility that exposure to a toxin might be the cause. The outbreak period coincides with the month-long litchi harvesting season in Muzaffarpur. Although a specific etiology has not yet been determined, the 2014 investigation has identified the illness as a hypoglycemic encephalopathy and confirmed the importance of ongoing laboratory evaluation of environmental toxins to identify a potential causative agent, including markers for methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), a compound found in litchi seeds known to cause hypoglycemia in animal studies. Current public health recommendations are focused on reducing mortality by urging affected families to seek prompt medical care, and ensuring rapid assessment and correction of hypoglycemia in ill children."

Because low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in undernourished children may be common, the CDC refers to the illness as a hypoglycemic encephalopathy, without a specific etiology having been determined. However, the etiology of AES may also be infectious, most commonly Japanese encephalitis virus. See: M Saminathan, K Karuppanasamy, S Pavulraj, et al. Acute encephalitis syndrome - a complex zoonotic disease. International Journal of Livestock Research 2013 3(2): 174-177.

"Abstract. Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is a group of clinical neurologic manifestations caused by a wide range of viruses and bacteria. Japanese encephalitis (JE) is considered as a main viral aetiology of patients with AES. Leptospirosis as a new aetiology of the patients presenting AES. There is seasonal and geographical variation in the causative organism. The outbreak of diseases usually coincides with the onset of climate change where the density of vectors fluctuates for transmission of the infectious organism either biologically or mechanically, while encephalitis due to other viruses specially enteroviruses occurs throughout the year as it is a waterborne disease. The newly introduced West Nile encephalitis (WNE) virus also causes acute encephalitis syndrome. The case fatality and morbidity are very high."

In addition, Chikungunya virus also may occasionally present as an acute encephalitis syndrome (Taraphdar D, Roy BK, Chatterjee S. Chikungunya virus infection amongst the acute encephalitis syndrome cases in West Bengal, India. Indian J Med Microbiol. 2015 Feb;33 Suppl:153-6. http://www.ijmm.org/article.asp?issn=0255-0857;year=2015;volume=33;issue=5;spage=153;epage=156;aulast=Taraphdar.

A ProMED-mail report: Acute encephalitis syndrome - India: (UP) R. prowazekii/head lice susp, RFI 20140306.2317645 from 06 Mar 2014 suspected that the rickettsial infection, _R. prowazeki_ carried by head lice, was the cause of death in the cases of hundreds of children in eastern Uttar Pradesh [UP, India] in 2013.

Because of the diverse possibilities of causation of AES, ProMED-mail awaits laboratory diagnosis of the pediatric cases discussed in this report.
