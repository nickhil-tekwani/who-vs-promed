[1] Kansas cases

Kansas health officials say 5 cases of listeriosis in Kansas are
related to contaminated cantaloupe from Colorado. 3 of the cases were
in Sedgwick County, with 1 of them ending in the patient's death.
State officials said Thu 22 Sep 2011 that at least 8 people in Kansas
have become ill from the bacteria since 26 Aug 2011, but only 5 of the
people have been tied to the cantaloupe. In typical years, Kansas
reports fewer than 6 cases a year.

The CDC says it has confirmed 55 cases in 14 states of people sickened
by the cantaloupes. Jensen Farms is voluntarily recalling the Rocky
Ford cantaloupe linked to the outbreak. The recalled cantaloupes were
shipped to at least 17 states, including Kansas, from the Rocky Ford
growing region of Colorado from 29 Jul 2011 through 10 Sep 2011.

[These 5 cases with a death were not included in the 21 Sep 2011 CDC
update on the outbreak. Adding these cases results in at least 60
cases and 9 deaths. The number of deaths is now equal to that of the
2009 _Salmonella_ Typhimurium peanut butter outbreak but that outbreak
involved more than 600 people. - Mod.LL]

[2] Texas: possible new cases

Of the people who got sick from cantaloupes contaminated with
_Listeria_, 2 live in Dallas County. The health department said the
81-year-old and 75-year-old have recovered. Due to confidentiality and
privacy concerns, the names of those who became ill will not be
released. The results from 2 other Dallas County listeria cases are
pending. DCHHS [Dallas County Human Health and Services] won't know
until then if the pending cases are linked to the outbreak.

[With 9 outbreak cases reported from Texas and 2 of these from Dallas
County, the other 2 county cases may well be outbreak-related as well.

[3] FDA: broader distribution of cantaloupes

Multistate outbreak of listeriosis linked to Jensen Farms' whole
cantaloupes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The FDA is conducting a root-cause investigation and environmental
assessment at Jensen Farms. This includes the on-site expertise of FDA
and state of Colorado microbiologists, environmental health
specialists, veterinarians, and investigative officers working
directly with Jensen Farms to find how the recalled cantaloupes became
contaminated with _Listeria_.

The experts are assessing the fields, the growing conditions, and the
environment. They are also taking samples and will determine the most
likely cause of contamination and identify potential controls to help
prevent future outbreaks.

Jensen Farms recalled its whole cantaloupes on 14 Sep 2011 in response
to the multi-state outbreak of listeriosis. Cantaloupes from other
farms have not been linked to this outbreak. The recalled cantaloupes
were shipped from 29 Jul 2011 through 10 Sep 2011. As FDA conducted
audit checks with Jensen Farms' customers, the Agency found that the
recalled cantaloupes were also shipped to Arkansas, California, Idaho,
Ohio, and Oklahoma, in addition to the previously mentioned 17 states:
Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska,
New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming.

Because a shelf life of a cantaloupe can last about 2 weeks, it is
also possible that some of the recalled product could still be in
commerce or in home refrigerators. Consumers are advised to check with
their retailer to find out where the cantaloupe they purchased
originated. It is the retailers' responsibility to know the source of
their products. If consumers do have the recalled product in their
home, discard immediately.

[It is likely that, as the number of states where distribution of the
vehicle occurred increases, the number of cases and deaths will
continue to rise as well. The incubation period of listeriosis can be
several weeks, which further skews the outbreak curve to the right as
well. We await more information regarding the source of the initial
contamination. - Mod.LL]
