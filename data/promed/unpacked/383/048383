A rabies outbreak has been declared in the municipality of Cauayan [Negros Occidental] after 2 people died this month [March 2017] due to the deadly disease.

PD, 63, a resident of Barangay Tuyom, was bitten by his own dog last year [2016] and died on [20 Mar 2017].

Last [Mon 27 Mar 2017] BP, 65, a resident of Barangay Isio [Cauayan, Negros Occidental] also died in the hospital and tested positive for rabies. He was bitten by his own dog on 15 Jan 2017 but did not seek medical treatment.

RG slaughtered the dog which bit BP and cooked its meat for his family. 10 members of the RG's family ate the meat.

Some of the family members have already been given medical treatment and are under observation for symptoms.

The provincial veterinarian has launched a massive anti-rabies vaccination and information dissemination campaign in the municipality as well as other nearby towns and cities to prevent the spread of the disease.

Though the consumption of cooked meat from a rabid animal is not considered a likely route of infection, those engaged in the handling of the animal prior, during, and immediately after its slaughter may be exposed to the live virus, justifying selective post-exposure medical treatment.

The rabies situation in the Philippines remains to be concerning. According to available OIE data (figures available for the years 2011 and 2013), about 200 fatal human cases are reported annually. The number of outbreaks in animals, predominantly dogs, is counted in several hundreds per year. The disease is widely spread throughout the Republic's multiple islands.

Rabies vaccination of all kept dogs and control/management of the stray dog population are essential. The number of dogs which were reportedly vaccinated against rabies in 2014 (last available data), was 482 057. - Mod.AS]
