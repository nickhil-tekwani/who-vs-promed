A 41-year-old woman living near Dresden in Germany visited her general
practitioner because of headache. She also reported diarrhoea during and
since returning from Tunisia a few days before. The general practitioner
requested bacteriological examination of a stool specimen. A bacterial
strain was isolated with haemolysin and biochemical reactions like that of
_Vibrio cholerae_. Further examination in the regional state laboratory
(Landesuntersuchungsanstalt für das Gesundheits- und Veterinärwesen (LUA)
Sachsen, Standort Dresden), identified a strain of _V. cholerae_ O1. The
national reference centre for enterobacteria (Nationales Referenzzentrum
für Salmonellen u.a. bakterielle Enteritiserreger am Hygienischen Institut
Hamburg) confirmed this result and characterised the isolate as _V.
cholerae_ O1, biotype el tor, serotype ogawa.
The regional health office undertook an epidemiological investigation. The
patient had taken a package holiday to Mahdia in Tunisia from 17 to 31
August 1997 with her husband and daughter. In the second week of their
stay in the hotel the woman and her husband both had slight diarrhoea.
Both had eaten only in the hotel, including raw salads and grapes, but had
drunk only bottled or canned beverages. The daughter had no diarrhoea; she
ate a special diet with crispbread. The family reported that other guests
of the hotel had suffered diarrhoea. Stool specimens from known fellow
travellers were negative.
This imported case of cholera is unusual because no infected area is known
in North Africa and no cases of cholera have been reported from there until
now. It could be an accidental event or the index case of a hidden
outbreak. This case is a reminder of the possibility of such unexpected
cases, an important message for general practitioners and laboratory
personnel.
