[Note: This current update came through in a weekly report email but has not been posted on the actual website as yet. If there are significant changes, I will produce a follow-up post with the changes when it becomes available. That being said, I felt it was important to publish a post updating the number of cVDPV cases for 2018, before the end of the year. - Mod.MPP]

[During the past week (20-26 Dec 2018), there have been 2 newly confirmed cases of cVDPV2 confirmed: 1 in Nigeria and 1 in Niger. There have been cases reported from Yobe state in Nigeria in recent times, with the most recent report during the month of November 2018, from the district/LGA (local government authority) of Damatura, the capital of the state. The case reported from Diffa province in Niger is the 1st report of a case outside of Zinder province. Diffa also borders with Nigeria to its south, but further east than Zinder province (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffa). This preliminary update did not have information on environmental samples.
