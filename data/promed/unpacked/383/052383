Forest officials found on [Tue 12 Mar 2019] [decomposed] carcasses of 2 female elephants in Kuldiha Wildlife Sanctuary in the district. The death of the 2 elephants is suspected to be caused by anthrax. The carcasses were reportedly found within a distance of about 200m in the sanctuary following which the forest department officials informed their higher-ups.

Later, the regional chief conservator of forest (RCCF) and assistant conservator of forest (ACF), Kuldiha reached the spot and sent the carcasses for post-mortem [evaluation]. Preliminary investigations suggest that the elephants were suffering from anthrax, said Laxman Kumar Pradhan, ACF, Kuldiha. "We suspect that the elephants were suffering from anthrax but the actual reason behind the death can be established only after receiving the post-mortem report," said Pradhan.

Two elephant carcasses, in a highly decomposed state, were recovered from Kuldiha Wildlife Sanctuary in Odisha's Balasore district, forest officials said on [Wed 13 Mar 2019].

The carcasses of 2 female elephants, aged between 25 and 30 years, were spotted by forest guards on patrol near Balichua in the reserve forest on [Tue 12 Mar 2019], assistant conservator of forest, Kuldiha, Laxman Pradhan said. He said the pachyderms appeared to have died from some disease. However, the exact reason of their death would be known only after the post-mortem report was issued.

A team of forest officials, along with veterinary doctors, have visited the site.

[The Kuldiha Wildlife Sanctuary (Odia: କୁଲଡିହା ବନ୍ୟଜନ୍ତୁ ସଂରକ୍ଷଣାଳୟ) is situated in the Balasore district of Odisha, India in the northern part of the state. The sanctuary is spread across 272.75 km2 (105 sq mi) in the Chota Nagpur Plateau region. It is linked with Simlipal National Park via the Sukhupada and Nato hill ranges. It is classified as an Eastern Highlands moist deciduous forests ecoregion. It is famous for the Mayurbhanj Elephant Reserve that spreads across Simlipal, Kuldiha and Hadgarh wildlife reserves. Locally in Kuldiha, the elephant reserve is known as Tenda Elephant Reserve. There is a watch tower strategically created at Garsimulia for animal lovers to have a look at elephants bathing or drinking water from a small stream that runs right through the reserve. Major fire was reported in 2012 that engulfed both Simlipal and Kuldiha forests causing significant damage to flora and fauna. The sanctuary has been declared an ecological sensitive zone as of 2 Aug 2013 by the government (< https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuldiha_Wildlife_Sanctuary).

The actual TV report has the carcasses as "decomposed" -- that is, not freshly dead. Transporting these carcasses to the state diagnostic laboratory must have been an interesting experience. But the advantage is that the park site-contamination will be minimal, and burning the parts in the laboratory incinerator is effective though slow. Personally I don't recommend necropsying elephant anthrax carcasses as a blood sample for culturing is usually adequate; accessing an elephant's nasal turbinate bones would be challenging but would be a more reliable sample in the face of decomposition. - Mod.MHJ
