The Mobile County Health Department (MCHD) reports that as of 23 Jul 2022, there have been a total of 4 cases of vibriosis reported for the year 2022. Three out of 4 cases reported injuries that were exposed to waters connected to the Gulf of Mexico.

_Vibrio_ bacteria naturally live in certain coastal waters and are present in higher concentrations between May and October, when water temperatures are warmer. However, the bacteria can be present throughout the year in some areas. While _Vibrio_ bacteria can enter the body through a break in the skin, it can also come from consuming contaminated seafood.

To minimize the risk of this infection:
- Avoid eating raw or undercooked shellfish, cooking foods to recommended temperatures.
- Avoid exposure of open wounds (including cuts and scrapes) to salt and brackish waters.
- If a person gets a cut while in the water, immediately wash the wound with soap and fresh water.
- If the wound shows any signs of infection (redness, pain, and/or swelling) or if the cut is deep, seek medical attention immediately.

Of the more than 70 species of _Vibrio_ that exist, about a dozen can cause human illness -- known as vibriosis. The CDC estimates that each year in the USA 80 000 individuals become sick with vibriosis, and 100 people die from their infection. During 2021, there were 4 cases of vibriosis reported to MCHD.

[The species of the _Vibrio_ cases was not stated. Most of the cases are likely due to _Vibrio vulnificus_ or, less likely, _V parahaemolyticus_.

_V. vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in saltwater, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with seawater harboring the organism or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc. followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the bloodstream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50%). Over 70% of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508923/).

_V. parahaemolyticus_ is a bacterium in the same family as those that cause cholera. It lives in brackish saltwater and causes gastrointestinal illness in humans. Symptoms include watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and fever and chills. Usually, these symptoms begin within 24 hours of exposure. Illness is usually self-limited and lasts approximately 3 days. Severe disease is rare and occurs more commonly in persons with weakened immune systems.

Infections with this organism, which can be normal microflora in seawater, have been associated with the consumption of raw, improperly cooked, or cooked and re-contaminated fish and shellfish. A correlation exists between the probability of infection and warmer months of the year. Improper refrigeration of seafood contaminated with this organism will allow its proliferation, which increases the possibility of infection.

ProMED covered a large 2005 outbreak in Chile. It was impressive in its size (more than 10 000 cases), continued to spread despite early recognition, and involved clams and mussels rather than the classical oyster vehicle.

There are 2 points to be emphasized: (1) vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and (2) most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just develop gastroenteritis. The range of diseases due to these vibrios are involving more northern geographical areas as overall global warming takes effect. - Mod.LL
