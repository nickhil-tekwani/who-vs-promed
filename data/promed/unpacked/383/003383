Thirty-four people died of dengue in the first two weeks of the month,
raising to 236 the total number of fatalities since January, the Department
of Health reported yesterday. Of the fatalities, 63 were from the Ilocos
region, Benguet and Nueva Ecija. A total of 13,024 dengue cases, including
1,815 new ones, have been reported so far this year by government and
private hospitals, according to the DOH. Most of the cases were from Metro
Manila (2,559), Ilocos region, Benguet and Nueva Ecija (2,275), Western
Visayas (1,962), Eastern Visayas (1,906) and Southern Tagalog (1,198). The
DOH dengue epidemic was now under control in Ballesteros, Cagayan and
Malaybalay, Bukidnon, but epidemics were still raging in Dumaguete City in
Negros Occidental and San Antonio and Jaen in Nueva Ecija.
In Metro Manila, the following areas have been declared dengue "hot spots"
because of the increasing number of dengue cases over the past two weeks:
Pandacan, Sampaloc, Sta. Cruz and Tondo in Manila; Bagong Silang,
Dagat-Dagatan, Grace Park and Maypajo in Caloocan; CAA Compound in Las
Pinas; Western Bicutan in Taguig; and, Karuhatan, Malinta, Marulas, Paso de
Blas and Ugong in Valenzuela. The DOH in Ilocos said Pangasinan and San
Fernando, La Union had been declared calamity areas following reports from
their health offices that the mosquito-borne disease had reached epidemic
levels. By declaring their areas in a state of emergency, local
governments can use their 5% calamity funds. They can also ask the national
government for additional assistance.
Out of Pangasinan's 45 towns and three cities, only Natividad, Rosales,
Santo Tomas and Infanta towns are dengue-free, according to Dr. Jovencio
Orduna, DOH director for the Ilocos region. Orduna said most of the recent
fatalities came from Pangasinan and La Union. As of Sept. 16, Pangasinan
had 17 deaths and 1,725 cases while La Union had 13 deaths and 512 cases,
mostly from San Fernando City. In Nueva Ecija, 11 persons died and 500
others were infected, according to Dr. Bienvenido de Guzman, provincial
health officer. In Benguet, reports of at least 50 new dengue cases in
Bokod town were received by provincial health officials Wednesday.
No new fatalities have been reported in Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur since
Sept. 4, but the number of dengue cases has increased. Ilocos Norte now
has 161 cases and Ilocos Sur has 214. Each province has 11 fatalities.
Orduna advised school children to wear long pants to school and at home to
avoid mosquito bites. He expected the situation to deteriorate should the
rains intensify this week. The DOH reiterated its advise to the public to
eliminate dengue mosquito breeding places by covering water containers,
replacing water in flower vases once a week, disposing of all containers
that can hold water like used tin cans, jars, bottles, and old tires, and
cleaning gutters.
