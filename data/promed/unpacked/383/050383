LEGIONELLOSIS - THAILAND EX INDIA: REQUEST FOR INFO

We recently cared for an elderly European man who came to Thailand after
extensive travel in India, last [visiting] 5-star hotels in Jodhpur,
Udaipur and Bombay. Two days after arrival, he developed a right middle
lobe infiltrate, fever and dry cough with WBC of 30,000. Sputum Gram stains
and cultures revealed no clues. He was treated with azithromycin and
ceftriaxone and initially improved but later developed ARDS which required
ICU care with respirator and PEEP. He recovered after 2 weeks and
serologies revealed a 6-fold increase in _Legionella_ titers. We looked at
Medline and India and found no reports of legionellosis in India. In
Thailand, there have been several serologically confirmed cases and the
organism has been cultured from air conditioning towers at many sites (J.
Med Assoc Thai 1995; 78: 57-70 and 1987; 70: 658-666).
[Do] any readers who know more about legionellosis and India? Is this the
first case reported from there?
