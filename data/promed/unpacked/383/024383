Karnal bunt is a fungus that is harmless to people but sours the taste and
smell of flour made from infected kernels. It also slightly cuts production
in infected fields. The disease's main impact is economic: countries ban
imports of wheat grown in infected regions. That could be as crippling for
American growers,who last year produced nearly $6 billion of wheat, as
would be the discovery of foot-and-mouth disease in U.S. livestock, said
Brett Myers, executive vice president for the Kansas Wheat Growers Association.
The suspected karnal bunt contamination was first reported to the
USDA on 25 May 2001, said Michael Bryant, co-owner of the elevator
in Olney, Texas, that found it. It took 7 days for the USDA's Animal
and Plant Inspection Service to confirm the finding, and 15 days before
it quarantined the first affected counties. Charles Schwalbe, director of
APHIS' plant protection and quarantine program, said his agency sent
the sample away for testing at a national lab instead of using a local one
to make sure it had accurate and legally defensible information before
taking action.
The Karnal bunt found in Throckmorton and Young counties in Texas
represented the first confirmed cases in the nation's wheat belt, an area
extending from central Texas to Alberta, Canada. [The USDA added
Archer and neighboring Baylor counties on 19 and 20 June,
respectively, to the quarantined area, and an elevator ... [was also
quarantined in Fort Worth.
Karnal bunt, which originated in India, was first detected in the United
States in 1996 in Arizona and California. It has since spread to southern
Texas and New Mexico. With half the winter wheat going to the export
market, discovery of the disease at the southernmost edge of the
nation's breadbasket just as the wheat harvest was moving north sent
shock waves through the wheat belt.
State regulators feared custom harvesters who follow the ripening
wheat harvest from Texas to the Canadian border would spread the
fungus. Oklahoma immediately closed its borders and ordered
combines coming into the state to be blocked and inspected. Harvesters
from infected areas without a USDA certification of cleanliness were
turned back.
[Fear has ... spread to Kansas, the nation's biggest wheat producer,
[which has a $1 billion wheat crop and nearly 10 million planted acres
each year. [Gov. Bill Graves said that the disease in Texas should be
considered a threat to Kansas wheat.
Bryant said his elevator has already lost [$400 000 because of the
infected wheat, ... cleaning costs and lost business.

[Karnal bunt of wheat is caused by the soil- and seed-borne fungus
_Tilletia indica_, which infects common and durum wheats and
triticale. According to the Kansas Association of Wheat Growers, the
outbreak of the disease in Texas is the first occurrence of Karnal bunt
in the hard winter wheat belt of the Great Plains. If the disease becomes
established in the Great Plains, severe economic disruption in wheat
production and exports can be expected. USDA/APHIS has protocols
in place to monitor for the disease nationally, and to implement
procedures to eradicate the disease. Transport of infected wheat seed
across state borders is a major concern as are wind-blown teliospores
(mature, overwintering stage). Once the pathogen is established in soil,
it can remain viable for up to 5 years. It is difficult, if not impossible,
to eradicate it from infested soil, although methyl bromide and methyl
iodide appear promising. Of current concern is the possibility that
combine harvesting machinery, if not properly cleaned, could transport
infected wheat kernels and teliospores to karnal bunt-free areas of the
US. At present, the disease is confined to 4 counties in Arizona, 2 in
California, 4 in New Mexico and 4 in Texas. - Mod.DH
