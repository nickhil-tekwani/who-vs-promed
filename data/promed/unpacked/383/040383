French authorities are investigating a case of contamination in a
batch of foie gras.
The French agriculture ministry said that _Clostridium botulinum_,
the pathogen responsible for botulism, had been found by the national
laboratory in a batch of duck foie gras under the Monfort label. The
product has been recalled from the market, and a warning has been
issued by the manufacturers.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts
recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated
with the food. Most of the food recalls are related to defective
preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result
in the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_, although it
appears that the organism can found in the canned food.
Foie gras (French for "fat liver")
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foie_gras> is, as defined by French law,
the liver of a duck or a goose that has been specially fattened by
"gavage" [force feeding. - Mod.JW]. Foie gras is one of the most
popular delicacies in French cuisine, and its flavor is described as
rich, buttery, and delicate, unlike that of a regular duck or goose
liver. Foie gras can be sold whole or prepared into mousse, parfait,
or pate (the lowest quality), and is typically served as an
accompaniment to another food item, such as toast or steak. - Mod.LL]
