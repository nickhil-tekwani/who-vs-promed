15 people contract anthrax after eating infected meat
-----------------------------------------------------
The Northern Cape government has ordered residents of Schmidsdrift to take
all meat and carcasses of cows that [have recently died to health
authorities, SABC radio news reported on Wednesday. This came after at
least 15 people were admitted to a hospital in Kimberley after having eaten
meat infected with Anthrax. A spokesman for the provincial agricultural
department, Blessing Plaatjie, said the patients were being kept in an
isolation ward. They all suffered
from swollen arms and skin lesions.
Five cows [have died of the disease on farms in the Schmidtsdrift area. An
outbreak of anthrax killed ten animals, including buffalo and gemsbok, in
Barkly West in January.

[Earlier in the week the opposition Democratic Alliance had called for more
funding for the government veterinary service already stretched by the FMD
outbreaks, the concerns over BSE, and the loss of many experienced field
veterinarians and research staff & faculty at Onderstepoort. As they
pointed out the latter losses cannot be solved by mere numerical
replacement. Mod. MHJ
