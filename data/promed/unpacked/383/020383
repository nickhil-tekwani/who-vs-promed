West Nile Virus Infected Birds Found in Winnipeg and Montreal
-------------------------------------------------------------
Manitoban health officials believe they have found a case of West Nile
virus in a dead crow from Winnipeg, the first time the virus has been
detected west of Ontario. [Two cases were confirmed in Quebec also, the
first cases east of Ontario - see below].
"Last year there were over 100 birds confirmed with West Nile virus in
Ontario so we anticipated this was going to happen," Health Minister Dave
Chomiak said on Fri 12 Jul 2002. Late Friday, Chomiak issued a news release
saying he had decided to authorize additional mosquito fogging as a
preventive measure. He also urged Manitobans to wear long-sleeved shirts
and long pants while outside and to consider wearing mosquito repellent
containing DEET. The City of Winnipeg started fogging for mosquitoes
earlier this year when numbers increased sharply because of heavy rain.
Meanwhile, two birds with West Nile virus found in Montreal last month are
thought to be the first cases of the virus in Quebec, health officials
there said.
Friday's announcements follow by just one day news of a horse in North
Dakota that tested positive for West Nile virus. Confirmation of
preliminary tests results in both the Manitoba and North Dakota cases are
expected within days from the Canadian Centre for Human and Animal Health
in Winnipeg and the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
Dr. Susan Roberecki, Manitoba's deputy chief medical health officer, said
the discovery of one dead bird is no cause for alarm. "Most people who are
bitten by an infected mosquito will not get sick," she said. "Only in very
rare cases will this cause any serious illness." Birds, especially crows
and jays, can carry the virus. Roberecki said people should report any dead
birds they find but not touch them, although there is no evidence the
illness can be passed from a dead bird. Dr. Terry Tannenbaum, a Montreal
public health official, agreed the risks to people are slim." The
recommendation to the public is to use what we would consider common-sense
measures to help reduce the number of mosquitoes and to prevent themselves
from getting bitten," Tannenbaum said.
There have been 150 confirmed human cases of West Nile virus in the United
States where the virus first appeared in North America in 1999. There have
been 18 fatalities. This week, 3 men in Louisiana were hospitalized with
the virus, the first human cases reported in the U.S. this year. The only
documented case of a Canadian with West Nile involved someone who got it
while in New York in 1999.
