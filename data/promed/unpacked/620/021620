When reviewing the symptoms of an elderly member of a [US Congressional
team visiting Beijing from Washington, it sure sounded like [he had fairly
"big-time" influenza. Since mid-July is hardly influenza season in Beijing
[or Washington, DC, I was hesitant to make the diagnosis and was
discussing with the patient that it was, after all, a worldwide disease
with sometimes strange seasonal effects. For instance, there appears to be
currently a problem with passengers on cruise ships visiting Alaska. But
just how HE got influenza was difficult to say.
"Now that IS interesting," he replied. "My wife just returned from an
Alaskan cruise, and she was sick before me."
It puts another spin on "geographic medicine." World travel is certainly
making us re-think the phrase "flu season."
