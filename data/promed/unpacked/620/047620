More than 900 people have been diagnosed with cholera in Chad since
Apr 2006, including more than 200 in the capital N'djamena where the
first case was only diagnosed last week, Chadian health workers said.
"Every day, we receive new cholera patients," a hospital worker at
N'djamena's dilapidated Liberty Hospital told IRIN on Mon, 23 Oct
2006. "In the last 24 hours alone we have registered 13 new cases."
So far one person has died in the capital. A doctor with the medical
NGO Doctors Without Borders told IRIN that the most severe cases have
been recorded in the town of Bol in the Lake Chad region of Chad, 120
km northwest of N'djamena, where 4 people have died.
Cholera had not been reported in West Africa for 100 years until
1970. Since then, there have been outbreaks in several countries,
especially during rainy seasons.

[2] Acute watery diarrhea, probable cholera - Ethiopia

Acute watery diarrhea has continued to spread alarmingly in Ethiopia,
with 29 880 people infected and the death toll rising to 279, despite
efforts by the government and humanitarian agencies to control the
epidemic since April 2006.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)
said government bureaus, UN agencies and NGOs had collaborated to
support the training of approximately 60 health and water
professionals from 12 districts, or 'woredas', in response to the
epidemic and its "alarming spread" in the northern region of Amhara.
An assessment by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in the eastern Afar
region showed 84 new cases, with 11 deaths, according to OCHA. The UN
agency said MSF-France would provide training for medical staff to
handle acute watery diarrhea, including case management, hygiene and
sanitation and isolation procedures as well as surveillance,
coordination and logistics.
The Ethiopian Ministry of Health, which started carrying out
laboratory tests in June 2006, has not confirmed the epidemic as cholera.

An official at the ministry of health and sanitation disclosed on
Thu, 19 Oct 2006 that 74 persons have died from a cholera outbreak
that has also left 1114 others affected in Freetown. Health education
officer, Lansana Conteh said the Disease Prevention and Control
officer, Dr. Alhasan Sesay confirmed the outbreak, after a laboratory
test was done on feces samples in Ghana.
Conteh said the outbreak is more prevalent in the eastern part of
Freetown whereas few cases have been reported in the central and west
of the capital. He also confirmed the presence of cholera in the
northern rural districts of Kambia and Tonkolili.
Meanwhile, emergency health centers have been set up and with the
help of WHO, UNICEF and other healthcare partners, volunteers have
been trained to sensitize local communities about the outbreak, and
how to avoid being infected.

[5] Cholera - Burundi (Bujumbura)

A rising number of cholera cases are being reported in communes of
Bujumbura Mairie and Bujumbura Rural. In the latter province, the
medical supervisor confirmed that Mutambu and Kabezi communes were
affected. As of 22 Oct 2006, the medical authorities reported a total
of 175 suspected cases (128 in Bujumbura Mairie; 20 in Mutambu and 27
in Kabezi) but no deaths have occurred so far. The Ministry of
Health, WHO and humanitarian partners jointly provided assistance to
reinforce the response capacities in terms of medical equipment and
clean water to affected areas.
In an effort to reinforce early warning and preparedness against
cholera, OCHA supported an initiative in Rumonge (Bururi) which set
up communal committees for early warning, response (through referral
system) and hygiene sensitisation. Rumonge is usually affected by
cholera, but with recent improvements in the water and sanitation
system with the support of ICRC and the preparedness measures, it is
hoped that the situation can be improved vis-a-vis 2005.
