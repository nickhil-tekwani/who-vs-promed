Ebola crisis: British medics head to Sierra Leone
-------------------------------------------------
About 100 soldiers from the Royal Army Medical Corps are travelling to Sierra Leone as part of the UK's efforts to tackle the Ebola outbreak....

Cabinet minister Ms Greening left RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on Tuesday morning [21 Oct 2014] with the medics from Catterick-based 35 Squadron, 5 Armoured Medical Regiment and the Royal Army Medical Corps. They will staff an Ebola training academy alongside some 90 personnel from 22 Field Hospital who left for Sierra Leone last week [13-19 Oct 2014]. Ms Greening will visit the academy and the site of a 92-bed treatment facility in Kerry Town, which is in the final stages of construction. She said: "Halting the disease in West Africa is the most effective way of preventing Ebola infecting people here in the UK. That is why we are providing 700 treatment beds in Sierra Leone, sending vital supplies such as chlorine and protective clothing, and training hundreds of health workers."

The UK is leading the [European] response to the disease in Sierra Leone, where it has pledged a GBP 125 million [about USD 200 million] aid package. In all, Britain is deploying 750 military personnel, including the Royal Navy's casualty ship RFA Argus. European countries have committed more than 500 million euros (GBP 400 million; USD 600 million) -- but the UK is pressing for that amount to be doubled.

MSF aims to start drug trials in Ebola clinics next month [Nov 2014]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Bertrand Draguez, medical director of MSF [Medecins sans Frontieres] Belgium, said academics and the World Health Organization (WHO) were currently assessing which drugs to include in the tests....

Draguez said priority would be given to pharmaceuticals that are already available -- so called 'off-label' drugs that were approved for use on other diseases but that may have a beneficial effect on Ebola. "To start the trials, I hope we are talking about weeks," Draguez said. "I hope it will be around the end of November [2014]."

Turn no one down
----------------
Draguez said MSF wanted to avoid having to turn down any patient who wanted to be involved in the trials because of the lack of availability of drugs. He said that while there were good supplies of Avigan, or favipiravir, originally developed by Japan's Fujifilm to treat flu, and Chimerix's Brincidofovir, the ZMapp treatment developed by Mapp Biopharmaceutical was scarcer. A 4th treatment, TKM-Ebola, is being developed by Tekmira.
