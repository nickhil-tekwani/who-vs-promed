Abstract (provisional)
----------------------
Background
----------
Anthrax had become extremely rare in Europe, but in 2010 an outbreak of anthrax among heroin users in Scotland increased awareness of contaminated heroin as a source of anthrax. We present the 1st 2 Danish cases of injectional anthrax and discuss the clinical presentations, which included both typical and more unusual manifestations.

Case presentations: The 1st patient, a 55-year-old man with HIV and hepatitis C virus co-infection, presented with severe pain in the right thigh and lower abdomen after injecting heroin into the right groin. Computed tomography and ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen and right thigh showed oedematous thickened peritoneum, distended oedematous mesentery and subcutaneous oedema of the right thigh. At admission the patient was afebrile, but within 24 hours he progressed to severe septic shock and abdominal compartment syndrome. Cultures of blood and intraperitoneal fluid grew _Bacillus anthracis_. The patient was treated with meropenem, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Despite maximum supportive care including mechanical ventilation, vasopressor treatment and continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration, the patient died on day 4.

The 2nd patient, a 39-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C virus infection, presented with fever and a swollen right arm after injecting heroin into his right arm. The arm was swollen from the axilla to the wrist with tense and discoloured skin. He was initially septic with low blood pressure but responded to crystalloids. During the 1st week, swelling progressed and the patient developed massive generalised oedema with a weight gain of 40 kg. When blood cultures grew _B. anthracis_, antibiotic treatment was changed to meropenem, moxifloxacin and metronidazole, and on day 7 hydroxycloroquin was added. The patient responded to treatment and was discharged after 29 days.

Conclusions
-----------
These 2 heroin-associated anthrax cases from Denmark corroborate that heroin contaminated with anthrax spores may be a continuous source of injectional anthrax across Europe. Clinicians and clinical microbiologists need to stay vigilant and suspect anthrax in patients with a history of heroin use who present with soft tissue or generalised infection. Marked swelling of affected soft tissue or unusual intra-abdominal oedema should strengthen clinical suspicion.

The major lesson to be learned from these 2 Danish cases is that any delay in initiating antibiotic treatment of a suspect anthrax case can be lethal. And I suspect that epidemiologists sometimes need to be reminded of the clinical realities of the beasts that we challenge. During 2010 there was a significant series of injection anthrax cases in Germany and the United Kingdom, and in England, Denmark and Germany in 2012. There is a pitter-patter of new injection-heroin cases in England this year (2013), but thankfully the inter-case interval is getting longer and longer.
