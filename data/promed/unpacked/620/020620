There is a suspected outbreak of the highly infectious African horse
sickness in the Southern Cape. One horse in Knysna is suspected to have
contracted the disease.
Cobus Dowry, the Western Cape minister of agriculture, says the results of
tests will be known later today [15 Nov 2006]. Dowry says if the horse has
the deadly sickness, it would be a blow to the export trade. He says the
department lost R 120 million [USD 16 563 190] 2 years ago, when a ban was
introduced on the export of horses.
"There was one suspected case in the Knysna area that was referred by a
private veterinary surgeon to the Onderstepoort laboratories to check out
whether there is horse sickness in that area. If there is ... we will have
a problem. But we hope that this was a small case and there's nothing to
worry about," Dowry said.

Two suspected cases of the highly infectious African horse sickness are
being investigated in Knysna, said the Western Cape department of
agriculture on Wednesday [15 Nov 2006].
"We understand there are 2 cases," said department spokesperson Alie van
Jaarsveld.
The cases were referred to the Onderstepoort veterinary laboratories for
testing. "We are awaiting the results of those tests," said Van Jaarsveld.
He said the possibility of an outbreak was a blow, as just 2 weeks ago, a
2-year ban on exporting horses was lifted on the Robertson-Worcester area
after an outbreak of African horse sickness there. Knysna is not part of
that area.
"In protecting the horse racing industry, we will pull out all the stops,"
said Van Jaarsveld.

[The recording of AHS in the Western Cape Province -- the only province in
South Africa regarded as free from the disease -- in 2004 was followed by a
2-year ban by the EU on imports of horses from South Africa. On 25 Oct
2006, the EC published Commission Decision 2006/724/EC, repealing Decision
2004/262/EC. It remains to be seen whether the current suspected case(s),
in case confirmed, will affect the recent "go ahead" plan.
