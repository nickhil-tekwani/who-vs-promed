The Mississippi State Department of Health is confirming 3 newly diagnosed cases of Haff disease, a rare but serious illness caused by an unidentified toxin in buffalo fish that can cause a condition called rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis is a muscle injury syndrome that causes pain, stiffness and rarely, kidney damage.

The 3 Mississippi cases are members of one family and are linked to the consumption of cooked buffalo fish harvested in Mississippi waters. While these are Mississippi's 1st recorded cases, Haff disease has previously been associated with the consumption of buffalo fish in the United States. Since 1984, approximately 30 sporadic cases have been reported. Most cases occur in the summer months. So far, there have been no reported deaths linked to the disease in Mississippi or the U.S.

Symptoms, which typically occur within 12 hours of consuming the fish, include muscle weakness and pain, dry mouth, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and dark urine. Intravenous fluids and other treatments can help resolve symptoms. Severe symptoms typically resolve quickly, although some patients complain of fatigue for months following acute stages of the illness.

The Mississippi State Department of Health is advising the public that the consumption of buffalo fish has been associated with a small number of Haff disease cases. Cooking buffalo fish does not reduce the risk of disease. Many Mississippians consume buffalo fish on a routine basis without illness. However, individuals who develop the above symptoms after the consumption of buffalo fish harvested in Mississippi or nearby waters (either caught or purchased at a retail establishment or restaurant) should seek immediate medical care.

[The following is mostly extracted from ProMED-mail moderator TG's comments in a prior post Haff disease - China: (JS) 20100929.3535. These comments were based on a CDC report: Haff Disease Associated with Eating Buffalo Fish -- United States, 1997 MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2010; 47(50): 1091-3; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056038.htm.

Haff disease, 1st identified in Europe in the 1920s, is unexplained rhabdomyolysis in a person who ate fish in the 24 hours (range: 6-21 hours) before onset of muscle tenderness, rigidity, and dark brown urine; it is caused by an unidentified toxin. Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome caused by injury to skeletal muscle that results in release of muscle cell contents into the circulation.

Laboratory features of Haff disease include a markedly elevated CK (creatine kinase) level with an MB (muscle/brain) fraction of less than 5 percent. Levels of other muscle enzymes (such as, lactate dehydrogenase, glutamate oxalate transaminase, and glutamate pyruvate transaminase) also are elevated. Myoglobinuria [the presence of myoglobin in the urine] is often mistaken for gross hematuria [blood in the urine]. Diagnosis is based on a compatible clinical history.

Treatment is supportive and consists of administering large volumes of fluid early in the course of illness to prevent myoglobin [an iron- and oxygen-binding protein found in the muscle tissue of vertebrates] toxicity to the renal tubules. Possible complications include electrolyte disturbances, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Symptoms usually resolve within 2-3 days. Historically, the case-fatality rate is approximately one percent.

Clinicians should be aware of food exposures that pose a risk to their patients and routinely obtain food histories, even from those patients whose illnesses may not appear to be food-related.

The CDC recommends that physicians who identify or suspect cases of Haff disease, based on the clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, and food history, should report them to public health authorities for initiation of traceback and recall of implicated food items.

In a review, 10 of the 12 U.S. cases of Haff disease reported since 1984 occurred seasonally during March through August (Buchholz U, Mouzin E, Dickey R, et al. Haff Disease: From the Baltic Sea to the U.S. Shore. Emerg Infect Dis. 2000:6(2):192-195). Unlike most other seafood-related illnesses (e.g., ciguatera, scombroid fish poisoning, or paralytic shellfish poisoning), which are associated with saltwater fish, most reported cases or outbreaks of Haff disease have been associated with freshwater fish (burbot, eel and pike in Europe, freshwater crayfish in China, and buffalo fish in the U.S. The buffalo fish involved in U.S. cases had been caught in Mississippi, Louisiana or Missouri waters). Unusual smell or taste does not help identify toxic fish. - Mod.ML
