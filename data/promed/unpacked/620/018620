Virus cause of water contamination sickening over 800 in NE Hungary
-----------------------------------------------
The likely cause of contaminated water, which sent 865 people in
search of medical assistance in Miskolc, NE Hungary as of Saturday
[10 Jun 2006], is a virus, the local county chief medical officer said.
Test results showed that contrary to what was believed earlier, the
source of the contamination is not a bacterium but probably a
Calicivirus, Judit Bodnar said.
On Thursday [8 Jun 2006], 258 Miskolc residents called on their
doctors with symptoms of nausea, diarrhea and stomach-related
problems; another 476 fell ill on Friday and another 131 people
reported showing the same symptoms on Saturday.
Head of the city's water works Laszlo Vojtilla said it has become
clear that heavy rainfall over the past few days carried contaminants
into the underground karst waterways, from which 43 000 Miskolc
residents get their water. The city has a population of 185 000. The
contaminated portion of the inflowing water has been disconnected
from the system, and the water is being treated, Vojtilla added. He
nevertheless urged residents to boil their water for at least 10
minutes before using it for cooking or drinking.

[The virus concerned is probably a norovirus. To quote Mod.CP, who
is currently offline:
"The family _Caliciviridae_ comprises 4 distinct genera; the genus
_Norovirus_ (formerly the "Norwalk-like viruses"), the genus
_Sapovirus_ (formerly the "Sapporo-like viruses"), 2 genera which are
associated with human disease, and 2 other genera which contain
viruses of veterinary importance. The genus _Lagovirus_ contains
Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus and European brown hare syndrome
virus, and the genus _Vesivirus_ contains _Vesicular exanthema of
swine virus_ (VESV), from which the genus takes its name. The genus
_Vesivirus_ comprises 2 virus species, the species VESV, which
includes also several closely related viruses isolated from marine
mammals, primates, skunks and reptiles, and the distinct species
_Feline calicivirus_."
