Tirthahalli taluk [sub district of Shimoga district, Karnataka] is affected again by Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD, also known as monkey fever) after 5 positive cases including one death have been reported in the past week.

[S], 47-year old woman, a resident of Ghantejanagallu village, who complained of high fever, headache, and joint pain, was admitted to J.C. Government Hospital on [16 Dec 2017]. The samples of her blood were sent to a laboratory in Manipal, where it was confirmed that she had KFD.

Later, she was shifted to the Government McGann Hospital in Shivamogga and was discharged from the hospital. On [Fri 22 Dec 2017], her condition deteriorated at her home, and she died.

Kiran S.K., taluk health officer of Tirthahalli, informed The Hindu that in addition to KFD, she had also respiratory problems. The blood samples of the 5 persons have been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, he said.

Mr. Kiran said the deaths of 3 monkeys were reported in the forest on the outskirts of Ghantejanagallu and 2 monkeys near Suruvinakoppa village in the 2nd week of December [2017]. Tests on blood samples and viscera of these monkeys have confirmed that they were infected with KFD. Following this, the Department of Health and Family Welfare sounded an alert in the area.

The vaccine against KFD has been administered to people residing within 5 km [approx. 3 mi] from where the deaths of the monkeys were reported. In 2017-18, vaccines [will have been] administered to more than 35 000 people in Tirthahalli taluk, he said.

KFD is a viral infection that spreads from monkeys to humans through tick bites. In 2016-17, 4 people died of KFD in Tirthahalli, and 48 positive cases were reported.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), popularly known as monkey fever, is caused by the Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ belonging to the family _Flaviviridae_. Shimoga district is a district in Karnataka state of India https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimoga_district. KFDV was 1st isolated from sick monkeys captured in Kyasanur Forest, Shimoga district, Karnataka state, hence its name.

The KFD virus (KFDV) is maintained by ticks, mammals, and bird cycles. The black-faced langur (_Presbytis entellus_) and the red-faced bonnet monkey (_Macaca radiata_) act as sentinel animals, as they are very susceptible to KFDV, as humans are https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4545326/. KFDV is transmitted to humans after a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, in particular a sick or recently dead monkey. However, no person-to-person transmission has been described (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/transmission/index.html).

As per the media report above, 5 human cases and one death due to KFD have been reported in Shimoga district, Karnataka in the past week. Deaths in monkeys due to KFD were reported in 2nd week of December 2017 which were confirmed by lab tests.

There is a need to create awareness on how to avoid tick bites, and KFD vaccination facilities should be available in the affected areas. KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with the increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease. Vaccination and personal protective measures against tick bites are keys to prevent KFD. - Mod.UBA
