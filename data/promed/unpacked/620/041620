Scientists of Plant Research International, part of Wageningen UR
[Wageningen University and Research Center in The Netherlands], have
identified a dangerous tomato virus. This virus causes
ever-increasing damage in Spanish tomato growing as cause of the
Torrado ("roasted") disease. The scientists recently published their
findings in Archives of Virology.
The identification of the virus will enable plant breeders to develop
virus-resistant varieties for tomato growers facing the Torrado
disease. The virus appears to be a completely new plant virus that
could not be assigned to any existing virus genus. The virus causes
necrosis of the leaves and thus may result in considerable yield
loss. The plants look as if they are burned, hence the name Torrado.
There are recent reports of the new disease spreading further.
Spanish scientists suspect that the virus is spread by whiteflies.
Some years ago, the Wageningen scientists, in cooperation with the
breeding company De Ruiter Seeds, investigated the 1st plant samples
from the southeast of Spain. Large numbers of filamentous virus
particles were found in the diseased plants. These were particles of
the already known Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV). The scientists also
found other, spherical, virus particles.
The use of so-called indicator plants, not susceptible to the Pepino
mosaic virus but susceptible to the new virus, made it possible to
separate the new virus from the PepMV and to propagate it for further
research. The virus indeed appeared to be capable to cause the same
disease symptoms in tomato plants as those observed in Spain.
The genetic material of this virus consists of two separate RNA
segments. Determination of the RNA nucleotide sequence and comparison
with data in worldwide databases yielded no viruses with similar
sequences. The virus cannot only be considered as a new species; it
is so different from known viruses that it can be said to it belongs
to a yet unknown genus. In their publication in Archives of Virology
the authors propose to name the virus 'tomato torrado virus'.

[A new virus was isolated from tomato plants from the Murcia region
in Spain which showed symptoms of 'torrado disease'; very distinct
necrotic, almost burn-like symptoms on leaves of infected plants. The
virus particles are isometric with a diameter of approximately 28
nanometers (nm). The viral genome consists of 2 (+)ssRNA
(single-stranded RNA) molecules of 7793 (RNA1) and 5389
(non-transcribed spacer) nts (RNA2). RNA1 contains one open reading
frame (ORF) encoding a predicted polyprotein of 241 kDa (kiloDalton)
that shows conserved regions with motifs typical for a
protease-cofactor, a helicase, a protease and an RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase. RNA2 contains 2, partially overlapping ORFs potentially
encoding proteins of 20 and 134 kDa. These viral RNAs are
encapsidated by 3 proteins with estimated sizes of 35, 26 and 23 kDa.
Direct protein sequencing mapped these coat proteins to ORF2 on RNA2.
Phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences
showed that the virus is related to but distinct from viruses
belonging to the genera _Sequivirus_, _Sadwavirus_, and _Cheravirus_.
This new virus, for which the name tomato torrado virus is proposed,
most likely represents a member of a new plant virus genus. - Former Mod. DH]
