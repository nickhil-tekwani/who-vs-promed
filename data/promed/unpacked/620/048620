maize-harvest-hit-by-eyespot-disease-and-poor-pollination-1217664.html>


Poor pollination and disease problems have hit maize yields in the
south and east. As a result, it has been an average rather than a
bumper harvest. Despite farmers and contractors enjoying excellent
harvesting conditions, the early indications are that crop yields are
not as strong as expected.

Tim O'Donovan of Teagasc [Irish Agriculture and Food Development
Authority], Moorepark, explained that some crops in the south and
east had been badly hit by the poor weather during pollination, while
eyespot had infected crops in coastal areas. However, Mr O'Donovan
claimed that the feeding value of these crops may not be
significantly reduced. He pointed out that the crops had high sugar
levels and that this would be retained in the feed where the maize
was harvested later than normal and run-off reduced. The vast
majority of the crop has been cut in the south, while 10-15 percent
remains to be harvested in the northeast.

[Eyespot on maize is caused by the fungus _Kabatiella zeae_ (synonym
_Aureobasidium zeae_), which was first described from Japan in 1959.
It has also been reported from Europe, North America, Argentina, and
New Zealand. Leaf symptoms are lesions with a light coloured centre
and a brown margin surrounded by a yellowish halo giving the
characteristic 'eyespot' appearance. The pathogen causes early drying
out of the leaves and leads to considerable destruction of
photosynthetic leaf area resulting in yield reduction. The disease
may develop on sheaths and outer husks, but lesions are more
concentrated on leaves approaching maturity. The fungus can cause
severe shrivelling of the ears. In extremely infected plants, kernel
infections may also develop. Severe disease will commonly predispose
the host plant to stalk rots. Eyespot lesions may be confused with
genetic spotting common in many inbred maize lines.

Host susceptibility is highest at 10-12 deg C (50-53.6 deg F),
therefore eyespot mostly spreads during the cold rainy seasons. The
fungus is specific to maize and can overwinter in plant debris.
Spores are dispersed by rain and wind, and the disease may be carried
over in stubbles from the previous years maize crop. Disease
management includes deep ploughing, which causes plant debris to
decompose, crop rotation, and fungicide treatments. Hybrid maize
lines with reduced susceptibility are available.

The name 'eyespot' is descriptive of the symptoms and does not imply
a particular pathogen. Thus there are diseases with the same name on
a range of hosts, for example wheat and sugarcane, which are caused
by fungi in different genera.
