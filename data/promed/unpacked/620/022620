Bird flu outbreak in North Korea contained: surveillance should continue
and veterinary services be strengthened
-----------------------------------------------
The recent outbreak of avian influenza in North Korea (DPRK) has been
successfully contained, FAO said today [Mon 25 Apr 2005], urging the
country to continue surveillance on the affected farms and elsewhere to
ensure that no residual infection remains.
An H7 strain of the bird flu virus had been detected recently on 3 poultry
farms near the capital Pyongyang. Although this virus caused severe disease
in chickens, it is not directly related to the H5N1 avian influenza virus
circulating in other parts of Asia.
"The virus appears to have been eliminated from the 3 infected farms by
combining culling of around 218 000 infected chickens, vaccination of
unaffected birds in unaffected poultry houses and strict biosecurity
measures," said FAO consultant Les Sims, who traveled to Pyongyang to
advise the North Korean veterinary authorities on bird flu control.
North Korea has acted promptly and appropriately and has provided essential
information in a timely manner, Sims said, and the official declaration to
the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) was done in due time. FAO
sent 3 experts to the country to assist national authorities in diagnosis
and disease management. This was done through the East Asian Regional
Network on Avian Influenza set up by FAO.
FAO urged North Korea to continue bird flu surveillance throughout the country.
"Reagents and laboratory tools provided by FAO will assist in continuing
the battle against the virus, but additional strengthening of veterinary
diagnostic and surveillance capacity is seen as a priority to ensure that
this work is completed," said Joseph Domenech, FAO's Chief Veterinary Officer.

North Korea contains bird flu outbreak - FAO
-----------------------------------------------
North Korea has contained an outbreak of bird flu, and the virus was not
directly related to a deadly strain which can jump from birds to humans,
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said on Monday
[25 Apr 2005].
The FAO said the bird flu outbreak in North Korea was caused by an H7
strain of the virus which causes severe disease in chickens but is not
directly related to the H5N1 strain circulating in other parts of Asia.
That strain of bird flu has killed 52 people in Cambodia, Viet Nam and
Thailand and has sparked fears of a global pandemic.
"The virus appears to have been eliminated from the 3 infected farms by
combining culling of 218 000 infected chickens, vaccination of unaffected
birds in unaffected poultry houses and strict biosecurity measures," FAO
consultant Les Sims said in a statement released in Rome.
China has tightened quarantine controls at its border with North Korea and
barred the entry of poultry to prevent the spread of bird flu.

[Hopefully, the North Korean authorities have managed to definitely
eradicate this outbreak, thanks to the application of stamping-out policy;
follow-up surveillance is essential.
According to OIE's Code, the eradication of a notifiable disease is to be
officially confirmed in a final report of the affected member-country.
An avian-influenza outbreak was initially suspected there on 15 Mar 2005
(20050315.0752), and, according to the authorities, could eventually be
officially announced in the country on 27 Mar 2005.
On 7-8 Apr 2005, Dr. Ri Gyong Gun, Director of the Veterinary and
Anti-Epizootic Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture, Pyongyang, Democratic
People's Republic of Korea, officially informed the OIE about the diagnosed
H7 outbreak. The notification added detailed information, including the
following statement: "Tests are currently under way to determine the N
subtype of the virus" (see 20050408.1016).
The results of the said tests will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
