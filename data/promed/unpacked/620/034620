MYSTERY DISEASE - HAWAII (3)
============================
Rhipicephalus sanguineus is known as the vector for Ehrlichia canis,
which is not considered pathogenic for humans. However, the fact that
these ticks are being removed from humans (they usually prefer dogs) is
intriguing. Also, the tick exposure history suggests the potential for tick
bites of other species known to harbor Ehrlichia pathogenic for man.
The major Ehrlichia species to be considered and that are known to elicit
an influenza-like illness that may persist include E. chaffeensis
(transmitted by Amblyomma americanum [Lone star ticks]) and the agent
of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis that is closely related to E.
phagocytophila and E. equi and transmitted by Ixodes spp. ticks.
Obviously, other causes of undifferentiated fever need to be excluded by
complete clinical, historical, and laboratory evaluation. Helpful clinical
laboratory findings in ehrlichioses include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia,
and elevations in AST and ALT. The diagnosis of these is best
accomplished now by retrospective serologic testing, but PCR assays
are available for diagnosis during the acute infection. Review of the
blood smears for Ehrlichia-like morulae (intracytoplasmic clusters of small
bacteria) should be done, but this is infrequently helpful.
Interestingly, there are many species of Ehrlichia that are probably
tick-transmitted, most of which are not known to be human pathogens.
Since the implementation of highly sensitive molecular identification
methods has revealed both of the Ehrlichia of human importance in the
last 10 years, it is prudent to keep an open mind about the potential that
other known and unknown Ehrlichia species (such as E. platys, or
Bartonella or Rickettsia, etc.) may be causative agents for a syndrome
such as described.
The identification of a potential bacterial causative agent could follow
from previous identification of emerging bacterial pathogens. The
paradigm has used PCR amplification of eubacterial 16S rRNA genes
with primers that anneal to conserved regions followed by sequence
analysis and phylogenetic characterization. If this is successful,
serologic testing using closely related species as antigen would be
confirmatory, culture nearly definitive. The presence of the causative
agent in ticks in the environment would also be supportive of a tick-borne
mode for transmission.
