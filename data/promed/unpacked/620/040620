The Department of Health (DOH) in Region 12 [SOCCSKSARGEN] has sought the assistance of laboratories in the USA and Japan to determine the cause of the deaths in April 2014 of 7 people in Senator Ninoy Aquino town in Sultan Kudarat province, who were initially believed to have consumed contaminated horse meat. Dr Teogenes Baluma, DOH Region 12 director, said they sent some samples earlier taken from the 7 victims to the American CDC in Georgia, and to another laboratory facility in Japan for examination and analysis.

"We don't have definitive findings yet as to the actual cause of the deaths but we're hoping that these laboratory examinations can provide us some answers," he said in a radio interview. The official said the samples comprised spinal fluid and blood specimens of the 7 victims, all residents of Sitio Parreno, Barangay Tinalon in Senator Ninoy Aquino town. The victims succumbed to severe poisoning symptoms several days after eating the entrails and meat of several horses that died of unknown causes.

Baluma said they sought the assistance of the US and Japan laboratories owing to the limited capability of local facilities. "We want to be really certain as to what caused their deaths so we can properly manage the treatment of the other victims and possible similar cases in the future," he said. Based on the agency's initial analysis on the signs and symptoms experienced by the 7 fatalities and other victims who were hospitalized, he said it appears that it was caused by the viral encephalitis disease.

Nestor Casador, Sultan Kudarat provincial agriculturist, earlier said the victims fell ill after consuming the meat of 3 horses that were slaughtered after turning weak and eventually died from unknown causes. Citing a report from their veterinary unit, he said 5 of the victims died several days after eating the entrails of the horses.

Baluma said no new cases of the disease have so far emerged in the affected area and all local residents who were earlier hospitalized have already recovered. "We have continuing interventions like antibiotic treatments for residents who were hospitalized and had close contact with the victims," he said.

[This is an interesting turn of events that may require a widening of the differential diagnosis bandwidth.

Toxic or poisonous substances were originally thought to be the underlying cause of the deaths of the horses and the also unfortunate individuals who ate the meat and entrails from the dead equines. This post suggests an alternate etiology, a viral encephalitis presumably involving both equines and humans with transmission by ingestion of the horse flesh and entrails. If this is the case, some of the following bears some consideration.

Classical rabies virus could do this and the non-hyperactivity form of the infection in man could make the diagnosis somewhat difficult. Specific immunologic stain of the brain tissue can make this diagnosis. If there are survivors, rabies becomes quite unlikely and a short, several day incubation period almost makes the diagnosis even more unlikely. Bat lyssaviruses other than classical rabies also might be considered and evidence of such viruses has been found in the Philippines.

Eastern equine encephalitis has been said to be present in the Philippines but it is overwhelmingly a western hemisphere disease and would be also quite unlikely. Trichinellosis can be a fatal, but not as rapidly, encephalitis from horsemeat and the histopathology should be characteristic with eosinophilia infiltration. This is also not at all likely and probably would not have killed the horses. Indeed, we do not truly know that the same agent caused the deaths of both horse and man.

Hendra virus is a rare emerging zoonosis that causes severe disease in both infected horses and humans. The natural host of the virus has been identified as being fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family, _Pteropus_ genus. It was first identified during the 1st recorded outbreak of the disease that took place in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra, Australia, in 1994. The outbreak involved 21 horses and 2 human cases. Outbreaks have appeared to be confined to the east coast of Australia. Horses have been identified as the intermediate hosts, transmitting infection to humans through close contact during care or necropsy of the ill or dead horses.

Symptoms of Hendra virus infection in humans range from mild influenza-like illness to fatal respiratory or neurological disease. Horses are the only animal species in which natural infection of Hendra virus has been reported, with a case fatality of approximately 75 per cent. The primary treatment for human cases is intensive supportive care. This virus has not been described in the Philippines but the bat reservoir does exist there. Whether this outbreak is related to a Hendra-like virus remains to be determined.

ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving information on the results of the investigation as it becomes available.
