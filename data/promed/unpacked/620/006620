The US CDC's Weekly US Influenza Surveillance Report was published on 18 Feb 2022, disclosing one human infection with a novel influenza A (H1N2) variant virus was reported by the state of California.

The H1N2 infection occurred in an adult who was not hospitalized and has recovered from the illness. And no ongoing person-to-person transmission has been identified associated with this case.

The patient had direct contact with swine before specimen collection. This is the 3rd human infection with novel influenza A virus that has occurred during the 2021-2022 flu season in the US.

Ohio reported one influenza A(H3N2) variant virus infection, and one influenza A(H1) variant virus (neuraminidase not determined) infection was reported by Oklahoma.

Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by various viruses such as the seasonal flu, avian, swine, and pandemic influenzas.

When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a "variant influenza virus," says the CDC.

In most cases, variant influenza viruses have not shown the ability to spread efficiently and sustainably from person to person.

The CDC has genetically characterized 618 influenza viruses collected since 3 Oct 2021.

Additional information on influenza in swine, variant influenza virus infection in humans, and strategies to interact safely with swine can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/index.htm.

Note: annual flu shots do not protect people from the swine [origin H1N2v] flu.

[H1N2 viruses commonly circulate in North American swine herds. H1N2v is rare and the spread of infection between humans is very rare. Human infections with H1N2v usually result in mild respiratory illness, with symptoms like those seen with seasonal influenza. Most people will have uncomplicated influenza and recover from the flu within a week or 10 days, but some are at greater risk of developing more severe complications, such as pneumonia.

Swine influenza viruses are not transmissible to people through eating pork meat or other products that come from pigs. Cases usually occur following direct or indirect exposure to pigs. This is not a foodborne illness associated with eating pork.

Farm owners, farm family members, farm workers, and those in contact with pigs should protect themselves from animal-related influenzas by frequent handwashing. They should also:
- avoid close contact with pigs that look or act ill;
- take protective measures if they must come in contact with pigs that are known or suspected to be sick. This includes wearing personal protective equipment like protective clothing, gloves, and masks that cover the mouth and nose when contact is required.

Individuals with flulike symptoms should:
- avoid contact with livestock, particularly sick animals;
- contact their physician for more information.

The same influenza antiviral drugs used to treat seasonal flu can be used to treat variant virus infection.- Mod.UBA]

[All flu vaccines in the United States protect against four different flu viruses: an influenza A(H1N1) virus, an influenza A(H3N2) virus, and two influenza B viruses. - Mod ML
