Bangladesh reported its 1st confirmed case of human bird flu on
Thursday [22 May 2008], saying a 16-month-old boy has been diagnosed
with the deadly virus.

"The boy from a slum in the capital Dhaka has survived. He has been
quarantined and his condition has improved," health ministry official
Mahmudur Rahman told reporters. "Although there is no farm in the
neighbourhood we suspect that he got the illness after his family
bought chickens from a farm," he said. Tests by the US Centres for
Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the H5N1 strain of the virus
on Wednesday [21 May 2008], Rahman said, but he declined to say when
the child fell sick.

The health ministry has set up isolation units at all public
hospitals across the country to deal with any human cases of bird
flu. While around 800 people were suspected of having flu earlier
this year [2008], no one was diagnosed with the H5N1 strain. The H5N1
strain has killed more than 240 people worldwide since late 2003.
Bangladesh, which has a population of 140 million, is the world's
most densely populated country with nearly 1000 people per square
kilometre (2600 people per square mile).

It was 1st hit by bird flu in February 2007 near Dhaka, but the
disease became dormant. It made a forceful comeback in January 2008
when a clutch of new districts were hit. At the outbreak's peak, some
50 of the country's 64 districts were affected by bird flu, officials
said. But the outbreaks began to subside in March 2008 as
temperatures started soaring, killing the virus, officials said.

More than a million birds have been slaughtered since the 1st
outbreak. Bangladesh's poultry industry is one of the world's
largest, producing 220 million chickens and 37 million ducks
annually. Industry officials said the bird flu outbreak at its peak
this year led to closure of 40 percent of the nation's poultry farms
and left half a million workers jobless. Earlier this year, one
health official told reporters there was "a huge lack of awareness in
the countryside" about disposing of poultry hit by bird flu and
people were "throwing away dead chickens in open fields, canals and ponds."

Also earlier this year, giant neighbour India suffered its 3rd and
worst outbreak of the virus among poultry in West Bengal state which
borders Bangladesh. No human cases of bird flu have been reported in
India, which has also carried out massive poultry slaughters. The 2
nations recently agreed to pool information on bird flu after
sparring over the source of the deadly disease.

[Bangladesh has become thus the 15th country in the world to report a
human case of avian H5N1 virus infection. Fortunately the affected
child in Dhaka is recovering. Further information regarding the
nature of the exposure is awaited.

Previously in 2008 human cases have been reported from China, Egypt,
Indonesia and Viet Nam. The most recent case was a 3-year-old male
from Central Java province of Indonesia who developed symptoms on 14
Apr 2008, was hospitalized on 21 Apr 2008 and died on 23 Apr 2008.
Subsequently at least 2 other suspected but unconfirmed cases have
been reporded from Indonesia.
