Feral pig hunters in the Upper Hunter Valley are being warned to be vigilant after yet another person acquired a rare bacterial disease spread from pigs to humans.

Brucellosis is common in many parts of the world but rare in Australia and not often seen in humans.

A person is usually infected after being exposed to animal tissues and blood, going on to suffer flu-like symptoms such as fever and rigors.

Last week, a northern New South Wales pig hunter became the 3rd person infected this year [2015].

Scone veterinarian Andy McClenahan said it is a nasty disease. "And in humans, it can be quite debilitating and cause a lot of issues." he said. "The symptoms of it can vary quite a lot. It can cause quite bad flu like symptoms, and, once you have it, it is very difficult to get rid of it, if you ever do."

[Feral pigs are widely distributed in New South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territory, and the Australian Capital Territory. They can be hosts of several diseases that can affect livestock and humans, e.g. leptospirosis, tuberculosis, brucellosis, among others. _Brucella suis_ is a pathogen that can be transmitted to humans and spill over into the domestic swine population. - Mod.PMB
