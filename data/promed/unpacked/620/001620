3 small children from Oslo, Akershus, and Ostfold are in hospital with a
serious kidney disease following an _Escherichia coli_ infection.

Oslo University Hospital authorities confirm 2 have developed the
potentially fatal hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), which can cause acute
kidney failure. The Institute of Public Health (Folkehelseinstituttet/FHI)
says the 3rd child, admitted to Ulleval Hospital, has also developed HUS.
Medical staff at both hospitals are refusing to give details about their
conditions.

Both the FHI and Food Safety Authority (Mattilsynet/FSA) are now trying to
piece together what the 3 children have eaten, as well as where their
parents bought which foodstuffs. They may have to wait up to a week to get
the test results back.

It is too early to say whether the 3 cases are connected, according to the
FHI, however, an FSA spokesperson tells The Foreigner there are normally 20
cases per year. "It is strange when 3 incidents occur in a short period of
time, but not impossible," she says.

[Both the classic _E. coli_ O157:H7 and the O157 verotoxin-producing
strains can be associated with hemolytic-uremic syndrome, a complication
that occurs in about 5 per cent of children infected. The type of _E. coli_
is not stated in the posting. ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding
the vehicle involved. - Mod.LL
