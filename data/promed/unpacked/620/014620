Antibodies Inhibit Prion Propagation
------------------------------------
Prions are the transmissible pathogenic agents responsible for diseases
such as scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in
ProMED-mail. In the current model of prion replication, direct interaction
between the pathogenic prion protein (PrPSc) template and endogenous
cellular prion protein (PrPC) drives the formation of nascent infectious
prions. Reagents specifically binding either prion-protein conformer may
interrupt prion production by inhibiting this interaction. Peretz et al.
[Nature 412, 739-743 (16 August 2001) examined the ability of several
recombinant antibody antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) to inhibit prion
propagation in cultured mouse neuroblastoma cells (ScN2a) infected with PrPSc.
Antibodies binding cell-surface PrPC inhibited PrPSc formation in a
dose-dependent manner. In cells treated with the most potent antibody, Fab
D18, prion replication was abolished and pre-existing PrPSc was rapidly
cleared, suggesting that this antibody may cure established infection. The
potent activity of Fab D18 is associated with its ability to better
recognize the total population of PrPC molecules on the cell surface, and
with the location of its epitope on PrPC. Peretz et al. conclude that their
observations support the use of antibodies in the prevention and treatment
of prion diseases and identify a region of PrPC for drug targeting.

[These are significant experiments paralleling the work of Enari et al.
reported recently in PNAS and referred to in the commentary to CJD (new
var.) - UK: reversal of symptoms (02) 20010815.1925. The question of
whether such antibodies might be effective in animal models or human
patients will remain unanswered for some time yet because of the long
incubation periods associated with all prion-related diseases. For this
reason further discussion of these prospective therapies lies outside the
purview of ProMED-mail.
Nonetheless, these experiments, taken together with the recent
demonstration of the prion-inhibitory activity of certain drugs able to
cross the blood-brain barrier, greatly enhance the prospects for effective
treatment and control of vCJD, an emerging disease of a novel type. - Mod.CP
