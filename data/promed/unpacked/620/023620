The Maine Potato Board [MPB] announced recently that 60 percent more seed potato lots tested in 2019-2020 were rejected than in 2018-2019. A total of 7.3 percent of all seed potato lots were rejected. It was the highest rejection rate since 2012-2013.

The results were emblematic of a significant problem across the country: new strains of potato virus Y [PVY] that are harder to spot during production than previous strains, MPB's Andrew Plant said. The primary cause of these rejections was recombinant strains of PVY. He singled out strains N-Wilga and NTN, which he said have become more common within the potato industry in the past 10 years.

These new strains have displaced the previous cause of rejections: PVY strain O. That strain had a higher likelihood of killing the plants, but was also far easier for growers to spot. Infected [plants] could be easily pulled out to prevent spread. In contrast, potatoes infected with new strains are virtually indistinguishable from healthy potatoes.

Plant said that the work at post-harvest tests across the US play the most important role in being able to combat the development and spread of such viruses by detecting the presence of viruses in seed potatoes before they can be utilized to grow more crops. He said the high number of rejections, along with similar results across the country, would reduce the nationwide seed potato supply over the next few years.

[_Potato virus Y_ (PVY; type member of genus _Potyvirus_) is one of the most damaging potato viruses affecting crop yields and tuber quality. PVY can also affect tomato, capsicum and some other related species. Symptoms vary depending on viral strains and susceptibility level of host cultivars. They may include mottling, distortion and necrosis of leaves and stems; premature defoliation; tuber necrosis and plant death; or no symptoms at all.

PVY is transmitted by aphids in a non-persistent manner, with _Myzus persicae_ being the most efficient vector. PVY can also be spread by mechanical means, plant-to-plant contact, or with infected planting material such as seed tubers. Disease management of PVY and other potato viruses relies largely on clean planting material and use of resistant crop varieties, but reduction of available virus reservoirs and vector numbers may also be useful.

The PVY isolates reported so far have been classified in 3 main strains, PVY-N, PVY-O and PVY-C, according to leaf symptoms induced on the experimental host _Nicotiana tabacum_. PVY-N isolates have been divided into 2 groups, one causing mild mosaic in most potato cultivars, while the other induces "potato tuber necrotic ring disease" (PTNRD) and severe chlorotic mosaic of leaves. It is referred to as PVY-NTN (necrotic group [N] and inducing tuber necrosis [TN]) and is the most virulent strain of PVY. It has been suggested that PVY-NTN isolates may have resulted from natural combination of local strains of PVY-N with PVY-O or PVY-C. PTNRD is present in most European countries and is very widespread in areas with warm climates.

PVY-O isolates induce severe symptoms on potato leaves, such as crinkling, leaf drop, or severe necrotic mosaic. PVY-C isolates causes stipple streak on potato cultivars carrying the Nc resistance gene. Some isolates determined serologically as PVY-O and inducing less severe symptoms in potato than the PVY-N isolates have been called PVY-N-Wilga isolates. PVY-N:O indicates a recombinant strain with PVY-N and PVY-O components.

The emergence of new and recombinant PVY strains is being reported from different areas (examples in ProMED-mail posts listed below). Numbers of co-infecting strains will build up with every crop cycle if PVY infected seed tubers are used, especially if these are moved to different areas where the virus strains they carry may combine with local PVY populations. PVY strains may also occur in (possibly synergistic) co-infection with others of the around 40 known potato viruses, invariably leading to severely reduced plant vigour and a dramatic drop in yield. The important role that tubers play in virus and viroid spread is recognised by the strict requirements for certified seed potato production in many countries worldwide.
