New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Al-Shahanya, Ar Rayyan
Date of start of the outbreak: 11 Feb 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Camelidae / 26 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: a single barn of 26 camels of different ages.

Outbreak statistics (rate apparent, expressed in percentages)
Species /morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / proportion susceptible animals lost*
Camelidae /3.85 / 0 / 0 / 0 /
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: during an existing survey (pilot phase of the survey), nasal swabs were collected from an 8-month-old camel among healthy dromedary camels. The sample was inoculated on Vero cells and cytopathic changes were observed in cells at 48h post-infection. Human hepatoma cells (Huh-7 cells) were inoculated with MERS-CoV to further functionally characterize this viral isolate. After 2 days, virus-induced cytopathic effects were observed in the inoculated cell cultures. Virus production in Huh-7 cells was blocked by pre-incubating MERS-CoV with a 1/200 dilution of serum from MERS-CoV antibody positive camels.
Conclusion: these data demonstrate that the MERS-CoV obtained from a dromedary camel is able to replicate in human cells and uses DPP4 as entry receptor, similar as isolates obtained from MERS patients.

Control measures
Measures applied: no vaccination, no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: quarantine, movement control inside the country, screening.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Department of Viroscience, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam (The Netherlands) (foreign laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Camelidae / real-time PCR / 19 Apr 2014 / positive
Camelidae / virus isolation /19 Apr 2014 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This is Qatar's 2nd confirmed MERS-CoV infection in an (apparently healthy) camel notified to the OIE since the start of the survey.

Initially, the Supreme Council of Health and the Ministry of Environment, Qatar, in collaboration with the National Institute of Public Health and Environment (RIVM) of the Ministry of Health and the Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands, announced (27 Nov 2013) confirmation of the 1st cases of MERS-CoV in 3 camels in a herd in Qatar, in a barn, which were linked to 2 confirmed human cases (see ProMED-mail archive 20131128.2080449).

The 1st MERS-CoV diagnosis in camels above was reported to the OIE as an "emerging disease" on 28 Nov 2013. The following epidemiological information was included in the notification (see ProMED-mail archive 20131129.2082115):

"The health authority in Qatar notified the presence of a confirmed human MERS-CoV (Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) case. A joint team from both health and veterinary authorities was sent to the patient farm to investigate the health status of animals and the contact person. A farm worker proved to be positive for MERS-CoV and samples were collected from the 14 existing camels in addition to one sheep, some pigeons and chickens, and some environmental samples (water, soil, animal food, and grass) and all were sent to the Netherlands for testing. All animals were kept under observation and quarantine and all were apparently healthy."

Follow-up report no 1, dated 29 Dec 2013, informed of the absence of additional cases and included the following epidemiological note (see ProMED-mail archive 20131231.2145606):

"The samples from the same herd tested using the same technique were negative, and this may show that MERS-CoV infection in camels is a self-limiting disease. The planned massive survey for MERS-CoV in animals is under implementation and the same herd is under systematic retesting. Follow-up reports will be submitted when there is new data."

The current isolation of the same virus is thus the outcome of the described commendable systematic retesting, which has become feasible by the cooperation of the Qatari health authorities with the (foreign) Dutch specialised virological laboratory of the Erasmus Medical Center at Rotterdam.

The notification was in line with OIE guidelines, included in their Q&A on MERS-CoV:
"Q: What would happen if MERS-CoV is identified in animals?
A: If information from public health investigations identifies a possible animal source, OIE will support further joint investigations. OIE Member Countries would be obliged to report to the OIE a confirmed case of MERS-CoV in animals, as an "emerging disease" in accordance with article 1.1.3 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code. If MERS-CoV was identified in an animal this would not necessarily mean that the animal is a source of human infection. Detailed investigations would then be needed to understand the relationship between any animal cases and human cases, and whether a finding in animals would be significant for human infection."

The detection of the virus in a young camel falls in line with recently published observations from Saudi Arabia; see item [2] in ProMED-mail archive 20140419.2414479 and the paper at http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2007.140571. However, some young camels in the Saudi farm showed, reportedly, (ephemeral) upper respiratory signs.

It would be interesting to note if other animal species, including bats, are also sampled in the vicinity of the surveyed camel farm.

So far, Qatar's handling of the issue has been exemplary, transparent, and effective. - Mod.AS]

[Since the 1st identification of the MERS-CoV in 2012, there have been 9 laboratory confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including 5 deaths in Qatari nationals. The most recent reported case in a Qatari national was reported on 19 Nov 2013. As of 23 Apr 2014, no cases have been reported by Qatar in 2014. Of the 9 laboratory confirmed cases in Qatari nationals, 2 had a history of travel to Saudi Arabia during the incubation period. The other 7 did not have a history of travel outside of Qatar during the incubation period, so presumably were infected through some exposure in Qatar. Of note is that 4 of the 9 cases in Qatar gave a history of animal (including camels) exposure during the incubation period.

To date, there have been over 350 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection globally, including over 100 deaths reported by Health Authorities in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait and Jordan in the Middle East. Cases have also been reported in the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Greece, Tunisia, Malaysia and the Philippines, all with a connection to one of the 6 Middle Eastern countries. As of today, 24 Apr 2014, there have been a total of 254 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 93 deaths reported by WHO on the WHO Disease Outbreak Notification platform http://who.int/csr/don/2014_04_24_mers/en/. - Mod.MPP
