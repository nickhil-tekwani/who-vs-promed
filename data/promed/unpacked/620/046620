WHO reports tamiflu-resistant flu in US, Canada
-------------------------------------------------
The main seasonal flu virus in the United States and Canada as well as
parts of Europe shows higher resistance to the antiviral drug tamiflu
[oseltamivir], raising questions about its potential effectiveness in a
human bird flu pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported the
elevated resistance in North America on Friday [1 Feb 2008], but said it
was too early to know what the chances may be for increased tamiflu
resistance in the H5N1 strain of avian influenza. It did not change its
recommendation that tamiflu be used to treat human cases of bird flu.

A number of governments have been stockpiling tamiflu, made by
Switzerland's Roche Holding AG and Gilead Sciences Inc of the United
States, for use as a first line of defense in case bird flu sparks a human
influenza outbreak. Health experts fear that the virus, which now mainly
affects poultry, could mutate into a form that spreads easily among people
and trigger a deadly pandemic. WHO said it was investigating the extent of
resistance worldwide to tamiflu, known generically as oseltamivir, in some
seasonal H1N1 flu viruses that have a mutation making them "highly resistant".

"The frequency of oseltamivir resistance in H1N1 viruses in the current
influenza season is unexpected and the reason why a higher percentage of
these viruses are resistant is currently unknown," WHO said. The US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention has reported a 5 per cent prevalence of
resistance to tamiflu in samples of H1N1 virus tested. In Canada, 8 out of
128 samples showed resistance, roughly 6 per cent, WHO spokeswoman Gregory
Hartl said. "These preliminary data indicate that oseltamivir resistance in
H1N1 viruses is geographically variable but not limited to Europe," the WHO
said in a statement.

A preliminary survey issued by the European Centre for Disease Control
(ECDC) this week [28 Jan-2 Feb 2008] said that of 148 samples of influenza
A virus isolated from 10 European countries during November and December
[2007], 19 showed signs of resistance to tamiflu. Of 16 samples from
Norway, 12 tested positive for resistance against tamiflu, according to the
ECDC [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control] study. The new
"elevated resistance to oseltamivir" appears limited to seasonal H1N1
viruses, and does not involve H3N2 or influenza B viruses which are also
circulating, WHO said.

"This means that oseltamivir would most likely be ineffective for treating
or preventing infections caused by these resistant H1N1 strains, although
the drug will be effective against other influenza virus infections," it
added. WHO said it was contacting national health authorities to determine
the extent of resistance to the drug. Neither Japan -- where tamiflu is
widely prescribed for seasonal flu -- nor Hong Kong had seen increased
resistance to date, it said.

"It is still early in the (seasonal flu) season, we don't have a full
picture yet," Hartl said. Past studies had found tamiflu resistance rates
ranging from zero to 0.5 per cent, according to the UN agency.

[Oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1 influenza viruses have been isolated from
patients in several European countries and now oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1
viruses are being reported in North America. The frequency of isolation may
be higher in Europe than North America, but this does not seem to reflect
differential use of oseltamivir by physicians since oseltamivir-resistant
A/H1N1 virus has so fat not been detected in Japan, where the drug is used
extensively. - Mod.CP]
