Newest peril from flooding is disease
-------------------------------------
Authorities said on Mon, 5 Sep 2005 that some of Hurricane Katrina's
evacuees have contracted a bacterial disease that is considered a more
benign cousin of cholera, but is potentially fatal in people whose immune
systems have been compromised. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta said the bacterium _Vibrio vulnificus_ might have
been picked up by people with open wounds who were forced to wade through
polluted floodwaters for a long time.
Von Roebuck, a CDC spokesman, said officials had detected the disease among
some storm evacuees and stragglers but had not been able to determine how
many cases there were. It does not appear that anyone has died from the
disease, Roebuck said [see 2nd posting - Mod.LL].
Since flooding began, authorities have predicted that New Orleans could be
stricken with a host of diseases. This appears to be the 1st confirmation
of illness caused by the storm and the flood.

A 60 year old man, a refugee from the New Orleans hurricane disaster, was
admitted to our Dallas TX hospital on 2 Sep 2005 complaining of pain in
both legs. Blood cultures drawn on admission grew _Vibrio vulnificus_
within 12 hours. The patient developed characteristic hemorrhagic bullous
skin lesions on both lower extremities. He died within 36 hours from
complications of septic shock despite treatment with doxycycline, cefepime,
and levofloxacin as well as activated protein C. The organism was
susceptible in vitro to all 3 antibiotics.
The patient was on medication for hypertensive cardiomyopathy with a
history of congestive heart failure. Otherwise, there was no history of
underlying liver disease. Liver function studies were normal on hospital
admission, and serologic studies for viral hepatitis were negative.

[The following information was extracted from the FDA's Center for Food
Safety & Applied Nutrition Bad Bug Book
<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap10.html>:
"Wound infections with _V. vulnificus_ result either from contaminating an
open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of
the body on coral, fish, etc, followed by contamination with the organism.
The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in
gastroenteritis. The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows
consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with
underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease (see below). In
these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in
septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 per cent).
Over 70 per cent of infected individuals have distinctive bulbous skin lesions.
"The infective dose for gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy individuals is
unknown but for predisposed persons, septicemia can presumably occur with
doses of less than 100 total organisms.
"In a survey of cases of _V. vulnificus_ infections in Florida from 1981 to
1987, Klontz, et al (Ann Intern Med 1988; 109: 318-23) reported that 38
cases of primary septicemia (ingestion), 17 wound infections, and 7 cases
of gastroenteritis were associated with the organism. Mortality from
infection varied from 55 per cent for primary septicemia cases, to 24 per
cent with wound infections, to no deaths associated with gastroenteritis.
"Ingestion of the organism by individuals with some type of chronic
underlying disease (such as diabetes, cirrhosis, leukemia, lung carcinoma,
AIDS), or asthma requiring the use of steroids) may cause the "primary
septicemia" form of illness. The mortality rate for individuals with this
form of the disease is over 50 per cent."
The much more severe disease in diabetes, cirrhotics, and other
immunologically challenged individuals draws a parallel to melioidosis,
which clustered in the area of the recent tsunami. - Mod.LL]
