Plague in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
----------------------------------------------
The multidisciplinary team arrived in Zobia, Bas-Uele district, Oriental
province on 25 Feb 2005 where the suspected cases of pneumonic plague have
occurred (see previous report <http://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_02_18/en/>).
The team now consists of epidemiologists, a clinician, data manager,
logistician and experts in social mobilization from the Congolese Ministry of
Health and WHO (Country and African Regional Offices and headquarters),
laboratory experts from the WHO Collaborating Center, Institut Pasteur,
Madagascar and a logistician and clinical management team from Medecins sans
Frontieres (MSF-Belgium).
The team is carrying out intensive surveillance activities. Since 25 Feb
2005, 4 probable cases (including 1 death) and 4 suspect cases have been
reported. A retrospective study of cases is ongoing and an additional 34
samples have been collected for testing at the Institut de la Recherche
Biomedicale, Kinshasa. The team is actively following up 113 contacts in
surrounding areas. MSF have established an isolation center for treatment of
cases.
A committee for the Control of Epidemics has been created with the local
authorities. WHO has provided equipment, including drugs and materials for
case management and for laboratory sampling and diagnosis.
