Newcastle disease in Sweden
---------------------------
(An outbreak of Newcastle disease in Sweden was last reported to the
OIE in December 2005)
Information received on 17 and 22 Nov 2006 (dated 22 Nov 2006) from
Dr Leif Denneberg, chief veterinary officer, Swedish Board of
Agriculture, Jonkoping:

in a zone following a report declaring the outbreak(s) ended.

Clinical disease: yes.
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory.

on 15 Nov 2006. There were 32 400 susceptible birds, 52 of which were

[In the previous posting I queried a discrepancy between the number
of susceptible birds and the number of birds actually destroyed.
ProMED-mail greatly appreciates the efforts at transparency and the
following explanation from Susanna Sternberg Lewerin of the Swedish
National Veterinary Institute: the probable reason for the
discrepancy between the number of susceptible animals and the number
of destroyed animals mentioned in the report is that not all animals
could be culled immediately on the 1st day, for practical reasons.
Therefore, all animals in the 2 flocks with symptoms (20 400) were
destroyed on the 1st day, and the rest (the 12 000 that were left,
and that were justifiably asked for by the moderator) have now been
destroyed as well. These birds were kept in a separate building and
did not show any symptoms, which is why it was regarded as less risky
to cull them later. There was, however, never any question about
destroying them. - Mod.PC]
