The Centre [National Centre for Disease Control? - Mod.SH] has
constituted a team to probe the outbreak of suspected Japanese
encephalitis [JE] in Muzaffarnagar district of Bihar that has resulted
in the death of 26 children. The team comprises Dr SK Jain, joint
director, National Centre for Disease Control (Delhi), BR Thapar,
entomologist from the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme,
Delhi; and IP Choudhary, senior specialist (paediatrics), Safdarjung
Hospital. An expert from the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of
Medical Sciences, Patna, who is already in the field with the National
Institute of Virology, Pune team, will also coordinate with the
central team. The team will leave for Bihar on Tuesday [21 Jun 2011].

In Muzaffarpur district, 4 more deaths were reported from the
"unknown disease" on Monday [20 Jun 2011] taking the toll to 26. The
disease has now been identified as Japanese encephalitis, which is
common in Uttar Pradesh during this season. 3 children died at
Kejriwal hospital, and another died at Sri Krishna Medical College
Hospital in Muzaffarpur in the past 24 hours. Around 30 children are
still being treated at the 2 hospitals.

The state health department has sent a team of experts from Regional
Malaria Research Institute (RMRI) in Patna to the district. The team
has collected the blood samples which have been sent to a specialised
laboratory in Pune for examination.

[This report is not clear about the diagnosis. It begins by stating
that JE virus infection was suspected, but later states that, "the
disease has now been identified as Japanese encephalitis".

The identification of JE virus as the etiological agent involved in
these cases is presumably the result of laboratory tests on the sera
of 4 patients submitted to the laboratory last week (see ProMED-mail
archive no 20110619.1879). It would be of interest to know which tests
were used and what their specific results were. It would also be of
interest to know if these patients, or others in the population, had
been vaccinated for JE virus.
