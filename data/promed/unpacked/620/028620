Egypt announced Thursday [26 Aug 2010] its 36th death linked to the
H5N1 virus, commonly referred to as avian or bird flu [avian
influenza A(H5N1) virus]. The 33-year-old victim, a woman from
Qalyubiya [governorate], was hospitalized in Cairo Wednesday [25 Aug
2010] after experiencing a high fever and difficulty breathing. The
Ministry of Health suspects she contracted the virus through contact
with infected poultry.

The World Health Organization says Egypt ranks 3rd globally in H5N1
documented cases. The majority of the cases in Egypt have come as the
result of close contact with infected domestic poultry. Approximately
5 million Egyptian families depend on poultry as an important source
of food and income.

[If confirmed by the WHO, this case will rank as the 112th human case
of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in Egypt since the
inception of the outbreak in Egypt in 2006, and the 36th fatality.
There have been some erroneous figures in this and another report
from this source (which have been edited out), and confirmation from
WHO is awaited.

Globally, there have now been 503 human cases of avian influenza
(H5N1) virus infection and 299 fatalities since the 1st human cases
appeared in 2003.
