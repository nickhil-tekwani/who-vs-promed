Disease hits Kabaka's herd
-----------------------------
About 100 cows, out of the 300 the people of Ankole donated to the
Buganda royal couple 2 years ago, are under quarantine at President
Yoweri Museveni's Ngoma farm in Luweero district.
Dr. Kasirye, a veterinary officer with the agriculture ministry,
recently said that Luweero district had put a quarantine on cattle,
following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the district. He
said that, due to the ban, the ministry that was responsible for the
transportation of the Kabaka's animals could not move them to
Mutebi's Kyankwanzi ranch. Kasirye said 80 cows, and some goats, had
been taken to the farm. He said that they were coordinating the
transport of the animals with the President's Office and with the
Buganda Cultural Development Foundation's executive director,
Kyewalabye Male.
The cows were collected from Kiboga, Luweero, Mbarara, Mpigi,
Mubende, Nakasongola, and Sembabule districts.
Officials from the President's Office said that the exercise was
difficult, because the animals were located in distant villages
without proper roads, and, at times, officials reach the homesteads
when the head of the family is not around to hand over the animals.
Kabaka Mutebi and the Nnabagereka officially visited President
Museveni's country home in Rwakitura in 2002, and, as a tradition,
the people of Ankole offered cows to the royal couple.
