Two exposed to Hendra virus horse in Mackay
-------------------------------------------
Two people will be treated with antibodies after a horse tested positive for Hendra Virus in north Queensland earlier this month [July 2022].

Queensland recorded its 1st case of the virus in 5 years when the positive test came back in Mackay on [8 Jul 2022].

The Mackay Public Health Unit identified 5 people who were in contact with the horse while it was infectious and 2 of those will receive monoclonal antibodies.

One is deemed high-risk and the other is moderate-to-high-risk, according to Mackay Hospital and Health Service.

No one exposed to the horse in Mackay has been hospitalised.

One horse on the property where the positive case was identified has already been euthanised, Biosecurity Queensland said. Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Allison Crook said the horse had not been vaccinated against the virus.

"Hendra virus infection can occur throughout the year, so it's important horse owners take steps to protect themselves and their animals at all times," she said.

Hendra can spread from flying foxes to horses, horses to horses and in rare cases, from horses to people. It can be fatal in humans.

Two people who were in close contact with a horse infected with Hendra virus in Mackay, North Queensland, will receive an antibody therapy on "compassionate" grounds, aimed at preventing them from developing the deadly disease.

One is deemed to be at high risk of contracting Hendra virus and the other is considered moderate-to-high risk, after exposure to the infected horse's respiratory secretions.

Mackay Hospital and Health Service said 5 people had been identified as having had contact with the infected horse, which had since been euthanised.

However, the ABC understands only 2 have had high enough exposure to be at risk of contracting the infection.

None of the contacts has been admitted to hospital, but the pair with the highest exposure to the horse will receive an antibody therapy developed in the United States that has been given to fewer than 100 people.

It has been administered on compassionate grounds in more than a dozen Queenslanders after exposure to infected animals.

A safety trial of the antibody therapy involving about 40 healthy human volunteers, published in 2020, found it was well tolerated.

Hendra virus was identified in 1994 in the northern Brisbane suburb of Hendra.

Seven confirmed cases of the disease have been diagnosed in humans, resulting in 4 deaths.

Dr Geoffrey Playford -- the infectious diseases director at Brisbane's Princess Alexandra Hospital -- treated 3 of the 7 cases.

He said the Hendra virus antibody therapy was manufactured at the University of Queensland-based Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology and stored there for use in humans exposed to an infected horse.

"The manufacture of the product is done to pharmaceutical-level standards, so we know it's safe," he said.

He said the therapy needed to be given after a person had contact with an infected horse but before they developed symptoms.

"That's when the product, from the animal models, appears effective at preventing that infection."

Scientists said the antibodies bind to the virus to prevent it from entering human cells.

Dr Playford said vaccinating horses was the best way to prevent Hendra disease.

The Mackay horse had not been vaccinated against the virus.

Dr Playford is the 1st author of the Phase I study, mentioned in article [2] above, of human monoclonal antibody m102.4, which is directed against the viral G fusion glycoprotein expressed by both Hendra and Nipah viruses (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30634-6/fulltext). Although this was only a phase I trial focused on safety and tolerability, m102.4 has been used on a compassionate use basis in Australia for people with significant exposure to the respiratory secretions of an infected horse. - Mod.LXL
