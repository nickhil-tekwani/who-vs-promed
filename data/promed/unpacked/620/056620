Japanese encephalitis kills more than 1000 in India, Nepal
----------------------------------------------------------
The death toll from an outbreak of Japanese encephalitis (JE) passed 1000
in northern India and neighboring Nepal, as health officials in the 2
countries prayed for an end to monsoon rains spreading the mosquitoborne
disease.
India's worst-hit state of Uttar Pradesh overnight reported 16 more
encephalitis deaths, taking the toll to 781 since the end of July 2005,
when the monsoon season was at its peak, officials said in the provincial
capital here.
Overcrowded hospitals today [20 Sep 2005] took in 55 new patients. But
officials said the disease, which is transmitted from pigs via culex
mosquitoes, is on the wane. "Earlier, we were daily getting 120 to 150 new
cases, but this number is now going down, and we hope by month-end
[September 2005], when the rains end, the disease will leave us," said OP
Singh, state health chief.
Volunteers from privately-run health organizations warn that stagnant
water, where mosquitoes breed, poses a serious threat to anti-encephalitis
operations. "There are huge bodies of stagnant water, and they are being
recharged by rains, and little can be done to help these poor people unless
the monsoon ends," said Shalini Raman of the Voluntary Health Association.
The annual monsoon, which starts over north India at the end of June,
begins retreating around 15 Sep 2005, but an unexpected revival, due to a
freak depression last week [3rd week September 2005], led to a downpour
across the region. "The rains are a curse for us, because every year it
brings brain fever," said Bhagwati Devi, who left behind her other children
10 days ago in the town of Barabanki to rush her encephalitis-hit eldest
son to a Lucknow hospital. "We are now counting the days for the weather to
improve," she said.
The authorities in the state of 180 million people claim efforts are under
way to eradicate culex larvae. But NGOs said the operation largely remains
on paper in Uttar Pradesh, where encephalitis has killed a total of some
3500 people since 1987.
In Nepal, the death toll was today [20 Sep 2005] officially put at 252,
with another 1510 being treated for the disease, which causes headaches,
seizures and high fever. "The disease is, however, expected to be
controlled once the monsoon rains stops in the next 3 weeks," Mahendra
Bahadur Bistaa, director of Epidemiology and Infectious Disease Control
Department, told Agence France-Presse in Kathmandu. Bistaa said health
authorities are spraying insecticide in pools, pigpens and duck ponds to
eradicate mosquitoes, adding the disease has spread mainly in the tropical
lowlands bordering impoverished Uttar Pradesh.

[This year's [2005] JE epidemic has hit Uttar Pradesh of India and all of
Nepal especially hard, with a death toll of over 1000 since the season
started 2 months ago. The obvious diminishing of the monsoon season seems
to coincide with decreasing numbers of JE cases. By the end of September
2005, JE will hopefully start to leave this area. - Mod.RY]
