We are very concerned by the appearance of three new cases of GBS in the
last two weeks. Their are all pediatric patients. 3, 6 and 7 years
old, 2 female, 1 male.
In two cases there was a respiratory infection 2 weeks before the start
of GBS. In one case there was a viral gastrointestinal infection 2 weeks
before GBS. Two of them are in intensive care.

[GBS is a progressive, but often reversible, paralysis following viral
infection. Is anyone else anywhere currently seeing pediatric cases of
it?
