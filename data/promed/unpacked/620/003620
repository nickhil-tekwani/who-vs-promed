South Africa - human anthrax cases
-----------------------------------------
3 laboratory-confirmed cases of cutaneous anthrax in humans have occurred
in Schmidtsdrift and Delportshoop in the Northern Cape province of South
Africa. One of the cases also had fatal systemic involvement with _Bacillus
anthracis_, identified on a blood culture. A further 9 suspected human
cases of cutaneous anthrax have been identified. It appears that members of
the community handled and ate the meat of a dead cow from a farm in
Schmidsdrift. It is unclear how widely the meat was distributed, and
environmental health officials are attempting to confiscate any remains of
the carcass.
The health authorities are actively looking for more clinical cases and
investigating the farm from which the cattle allegedly originated.
Extensive health promotion will be undertaken in the area. Animal anthrax
is endemic in southern Africa, and recent outbreaks in animals have
occurred in Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia. A program for annual
immunization of cattle is in place in South Africa.

[The prompt and accurate report from Drs. Blumberg, Frean & de Jong is
greatly appreciated. I am sorry it could not be equally as quickly posted,
but I was out in west Texas setting up field experiments for later this
coming summer. - Mod.MHJ]

Anthrax outbreak under control in Northern Cape
-----------------------------------------------
The anthrax outbreak in the Northern Cape is under control, the Northern
Cape department of health said on Wednesday [19 Jan 2005]. Health
spokesperson Dineo Khechane said all patients treated for anthrax or
suspected anthrax in the Northern Cape in the past 2 months have been
discharged. They were treated in the Kimberley and Barkly West hospitals
during December 2004 and January 2005.
"We have passed the 7 day incubation period. From 7 Jan 2005, no further
cases were reported," Khechane said. It was reported earlier that 8 men
from Schmidtsdrift became sick after eating meat from a dead cow just
before Christmas.
Health officials later confirmed that 2 men from Schmidtsdrift were treated
for anthrax at the Kimberley health complex after they were admitted on 31
Dec 2004. During the 1st week of January 2005, 2 more men from Delportshoop
were admitted to the hospital with the same symptoms. A local newspaper
also reported at the time that about 50 people were treated. Health
officials, however, said that only 4 people were treated at the Kimberley
hospital and one at the Barkly West hospital.
The Northern Cape MEC for health, Kagisho Molusi, thanked the province's
outbreak response team and other health care practitioners on Wednesday [19
Jan 2005] for successfully managing the outbreak.
