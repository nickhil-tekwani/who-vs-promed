The New Mexico Department of Health is urging pet and livestock owners in De Baca County and surrounding areas to vaccinate their animals against rabies after a cat tested positive for rabies this week. This is the 1st cat having tested positive for rabies in De Baca County based on records going back to 1966.

"This positive rabies test in a cat shows the importance of keeping pets, horses, and valuable livestock up to date on rabies vaccinations," said Dr. Chad Smelser, deputy state epidemiologist. "Domestic animals can come into contact with rabid wild animals and then transmit the disease to humans."

Barn cats and feral cat colonies are also recommended to be vaccinated against rabies.

Rabies is a deadly viral disease affecting all mammals and can be prevented but not cured. Most rabies cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention each year occur in wild animals like raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes. Rabies vaccination of dogs and cats is mandated by state law. Unvaccinated pets exposed to a rabid animal must either be euthanized or put into strict isolation for 6 months to prevent them from exposing people to rabies.

"A cat testing positive for rabies is an indication there may be other wildlife in the area with the disease," said Dr. Smelser. "People need to avoid contact with all wild animals as several species are known to carry rabies. If you are bitten by a wild mammal, seek medical attention immediately."

The Department of Health recommends the following to keep you and your family safe from rabies:

- Always keep pets on a leash.
- Pets should be up to date on rabies vaccinations and wearing current license tags on their collar.
- If your cat or dog has been bitten or scratched, especially by a wild animal, call your pet's veterinarian even if the wound is superficial.
- Horses and other livestock should also be considered for rabies vaccination to protect them from rabid animals that may attack them.
- Stay away from wild or unfamiliar animals.
-Do not attempt to feed, approach, or touch wild animals (alive or dead). Teach this important message to your children, and always keep a close eye on your children.
- If you or someone you know is bitten by an animal, or comes into contact with an animal's saliva, wash the exposed site immediately with soap and water. Be sure to report the bite to local animal control and seek medical care as soon as possible.
- If your cat or dog has been bitten or scratched, especially by a wild mammal, call your pet's veterinarian even if the wound is superficial.
- If you see a sick or dead wild animal or a wild animal acting abnormally, report it to your local animal control authorities or the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish.

Rabid animals may show no fear of people and be aggressive, or they may be quiet and can even seem friendly.

https://eu.gastongazette.com/story/news/2022/12/03/gastonia-dog-kills-rabid-raccoon/69698399007/


A pet dog killed a raccoon that ended up having rabies, according to Gaston County Police Animal Care and Enforcement.

Police were called to the 3400 block of Autumn Drive, Gastonia, at 9:15 p.m. Wed 30 Nov 2022. A resident's dog had killed a raccoon in the backyard of the home, according to police.

The dog was current with its rabies vaccinations and received a booster soon after the incident. The state lab reported Fri 2 Dec 2022 that the raccoon was positive for rabies.

Animal Care and Enforcement notified the resident and conducted a neighborhood canvas in the area of Autumn Drive to notify the community of the positive rabies result and to verify rabies vaccinations for family animals in the area.

Gaston County Police Animal Care and Enforcement stresses the importance of having an up-to-date rabies vaccination for all pets. By keeping your pets current on their rabies vaccines, you are protecting them from contracting the disease from wildlife and spreading the disease to your family, other animals, and people in the community.

Also, it is important to never handle or transport sick animals. The animal could have rabies. Gaston County residents should contact Gaston County Police Animal Care and Enforcement to capture and transport sick animals.

This represents the 13th confirmed rabies case in Gaston County this year [2022].

[3] Connecticut (Windham County): raccoon, human exposure
Date: Mon 5 Dec 2022

https://abc7chicago.com/girl-attacked-by-raccoon-ashford-connecticut-attack-home-surveillance-camera/12523396/


A 5-year-old girl was attacked by an aggressive raccoon while waiting for the school bus outside her home in Ashford, Connecticut, on 2 Dec [2022].

[LM]'s home surveillance camera captured the scary moment her daughter, [RM], was bitten. She told Storyful her daughter stepped outside to wait for the bus and the raccoon was sitting on the porch.

The video shows the raccoon quickly latch onto [RM]'s leg, who then screams and attempts to shake the animal off. [LM] rushes to help her daughter, grabbing onto the animal by the scruff of its neck. She's able to remove it, and at one point can be seen holding both the raccoon and her daughter. Once her daughter is inside, she throws the animal into her yard where it can be seen waddling away.

"I heard her screaming and ran to see what was going on. I thought maybe she slammed her hand in the door; I was not expecting to see a raccoon attacking her," [LM] said. "If I didn't have the video, I wouldn't be able to tell you exactly what happened; it all happened so fast."

She told Storyful [RM] has a few puncture wounds and said they both have scratches, but they are doing okay. She said [RM], who normally wears leggings, was wearing jeans, and she believes this helped prevent her from being more seriously injured.

[LM] confirmed they did go to the hospital and said the doctor's main concern was rabies, as the raccoon was out during the day and very aggressive, both signs of the viral disease, according to the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.

Though they've not been able to find the raccoon to test it for rabies, she said they will be receiving rabies vaccines over the coming weeks.

[4] California (Los Angeles County): coyote, human exposure
Date: Sun 4 Dec 2022

https://www.foxnews.com/us/father-springs-into-action-after-coyote-attacks-toddler-outside-los-angeles-home


A coyote ambushed a California family's 2-year-old daughter outside their Los Angeles home Friday [2 Dec 2022], dragging her across the lawn before her father charged at the animal and scared it away.

The girl sustained non-life-threatening injuries and was treated in the emergency room, where she also received the rabies vaccine [PEP: post-exposure prophylaxis], the family said.

[SE], the girl's mother, told KTLA her daughter suffered from scratches and some bruising.

"She has a lot of scratches on her left leg, and one of them is really deep," her mother said. "The coyote just kind of dragged her, so her face is also a little bit bruised," she added.

The incident, which happened at approximately 3:42 p.m. on Friday [2 Dec 2022], was recorded by the family's Ring home surveillance system.

In the video, [AE] (father) can be seen removing his daughter from her car seat and setting her next to the vehicle as he turns back to reach for something in the SUV.

Then the animal struck.

The coyote leaps at the girl and drags her several feet away, across the driveway and onto the sidewalk. The girl is face down on the concrete.

The father responds to the commotion, running after the girl and securing her in his arms. He then throws what appears to be a water bottle at the coyote, causing it to run off.

After carrying the toddler into the home, the father exits welding a piece of wood, and appears to look for and pursue the creature.

The entire incident is over within a few seconds.

The family had just arrived home from her preschool, the parents said.

Coyotes are prevalent in Los Angeles, though human attacks are not common.

[5] Michigan (Oakland County): kitten

https://www.michigan.gov/mdard/about/media/pressreleases/2022/12/06/oakland-county-kitten-infected-with-rabies


Today [6 Dec 2022], the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) state veterinarian, Nora Wineland, DVM, released the following statement due to an unvaccinated 6-month-old kitten becoming infected with rabies in Oakland County.

"While this case is unfortunate, it is not unexpected, as rabies is regularly detected in Michigan's wildlife, particularly in bats and skunks. This means the virus is present, making it important to vaccinate domestic animals against rabies," said Dr. Wineland. "Any mammal, including humans, can be infected with rabies. By vaccinating pets and livestock against the virus and having them avoid contact with wildlife, it protects both animal health and public health."

The kitten was found as a stray about 6 weeks prior to its diagnosis. It was taken to a veterinary practice when it was not eating or drinking and was acting aggressively and unable to use its hind limbs. The kitten progressively became more ill and was humanely euthanized.

Rabies is a viral disease most commonly transmitted by a rabid animal bite. In 2022, a total of 47 rabid animals, including this kitten, have been detected in Michigan. The other cases include 45 bats and one skunk that were found across 24 counties in Michigan.

Even if an animal is kept indoors, keeping their vaccination against the virus up to date serves as an important barrier if they are ever exposed to a wild or stray animal that could be carrying the disease. Please contact your veterinarian for more information about rabies vaccination or to schedule an appointment.

Also, if you think your animal may have had contact with rabid wildlife, it is important to immediately contact your veterinarian or MDARD to determine the next steps to take.

If you are a veterinarian, remember to always consider rabies as a potential diagnosis for neurologic animals. Rabies test kits and submittal forms are available through the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

In Michigan, rabies is reportable to the State Veterinarian's Office. Diseases can be reported to MDARD's Animal Industry Division by email or phone.

[6] Texas (undisclosed county): bat, deceased child
Date: Thu 8 Dec 2022
Source: Daily Mail [abridged, edited]
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11513837/Bat-bite-kills-Texas-boy-rabies-case-years.html


A Texas boy died from rabies after being bitten by a bat, health officials revealed today [8 Dec 2022] as cases of the disease rebounded for the 1st time in years.

The child, aged 7, had picked up the animal outside his apartment in Medina County in late August 2021 when he suffered the injury.

He told his parents he had been bitten, but they put off taking him to hospital because there were no teeth marks, and he did not initially show symptoms. But his condition gradually deteriorated over the next 2 months, leaving doctors perplexed when a spate of hospital tests for more common infections came back negative.

His death -- one of 5 fatal rabies cases in 2021 -- was revealed today [8 Dec 2022] by the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC). It marks the highest number in a decade. There had not been a single infection in 2019 or 2020.

It comes as the CDC warned in May [2022] that rabies could sneak back into the US through imported animals from high-risk countries.

The Barren River District Health Department is reporting a dog in the southwest corner of Simpson County near the Logan County line tested positive for rabies on Thu 8 Dec 2022. The dog was exhibiting signs [of rabies] and was submitted for testing.

At this time, it is unknown how the dog became infected. Rabies is a viral disease attacking the nervous system. It is predominantly seen in bats and skunks, as well as in domestic animals, such as dogs and cats. The best protection for pet owners, their families, and their pets is to keep their dogs', cats', and ferrets' rabies vaccinations up to date.

[Rabies is a deadly virus! Deadly to animals, and to untreated humans.

Please don't take any chances with this disease. It wants your life, and it will take it, if you let it.

The good news is that there are ways to prevent this tragedy.

Preventions starts by keeping all your pets' rabies prevention vaccines up to date. Pets range in size from the small cat or dog to horses, cows, sheep, and goats.

If you are bitten by animal, especially a wild animal such as a skunk, fox, or coyote, or a domestic pet acting strangely, please clean the wound with soap and water and seek medical attention immediately. If you even think you have been bitten by a bat, seek medical treatment. Bats can bite and leave only a tiny scratch or no visible wound, but the rabies virus can enter the tiny scratch.

"Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine given on the day of the rabies exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) should always include administration of both HRIG and rabies vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

"People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving pre-exposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

"Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin."

"The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have your shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses. Patient assistance programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients are available for rabies vaccine and immune globulin.

"People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities."
(https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html)

"Human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) is administered only once, at the beginning of anti-rabies prophylaxis, to previously unvaccinated persons. This will provide immediate antibodies until the body can respond to the vaccine by actively producing antibodies of its own. If possible, the full dose of HRIG should be thoroughly infiltrated in the area around and into the wounds. Any remaining volume should be injected intramuscularly at a site distant from vaccine administration.

"HRIG should never be administered in the same syringe or in the same anatomical site as the 1st vaccine dose. However, subsequent doses of vaccine in the 4-dose series can be administered in the same anatomic location where the HRIG dose was administered.

"If HRIG was not administered when vaccination was begun, it can be administered up to 7 days after the administration of the 1st dose of vaccine. Beyond the 7th day, HRIG is not recommended since an antibody response to the vaccine is presumed to have occurred.

"Because HRIG can partially suppress active production of antibody, no more than the recommended dose should be administered. The recommended dose of HRIG is 20 IU/kg body weight. This formula is applicable to all age groups, including children."
(https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/hrig.html)

"A regimen of 4 1-mL doses of HDCV or PCEC vaccines should be administered intramuscularly to previously unvaccinated persons.

"The 1st dose of the 4-dose course should be administered as soon as possible after exposure. Additional doses should be administered on days 3, 7, and 14 after the 1st vaccination. For adults, the vaccination should always be administered intramuscularly in the deltoid area (arm). For children, the anterolateral aspect of the thigh is also acceptable. The gluteal area should never be used for rabies vaccine injections because observations suggest administration in this area results in lower neutralizing antibody titers."
(https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/vaccine.html)

There is treatment if you are bitten, but it hinges on getting treatment immediately.

We express our sincere sympathy to the family that lost a child. - Mod.TG
