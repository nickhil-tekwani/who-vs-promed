In a follow-up to a report last [Fri 15 Sep 2017], on the pneumonic plague outbreak in Madagascar, the WHO offered up an updated case count and additional details surrounding the occurrence of plague on the island nation off the southeast coast of Africa. The outbreak was detected on [Mon 11 Sep 2017] following the notification of the death of 47-year-old woman from Fort Duchesne, admitted to Soavinandriana Hospital with respiratory disease. After confirmation that the cause of illness and death was pneumonic plague, the Directorate of Health Surveillance and Epidemiological Surveillance (DVSSE) immediately launched field investigations.

These investigations revealed that the primary case was likely to have been a 31-year-old male from Tamatave (a.k.a. Toamasina) on the east coast, visiting Ankazobe District in the Central Highlands (Hauts-Plateaux) - a plague endemic area. He developed malaria-like symptoms in mid-August, and during his journey in a bush-taxi from Ankazobe District to Tamatave (via Antananarivo) on [Sun 27 Aug 2017], he developed severe respiratory symptoms and died. After preservation of the body at Moramanga District Hospital, he was buried in a village close to Tamatave. Subsequently, 27 other individuals became ill - all cases either had direct contact with the primary case or other epidemiologic links.

As of [Thu 14 Sep 2017], a total of 28 cases, including 5 deaths (case fatality rate 17.8 percent) have been reported since the initial case was detected on [Sun 27 Aug 2017]. A total of 2 cases have been confirmed by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) at the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar (IPM). Thus far the outbreak is localized in Tamatave and Faratsiho in Vakinankaratra Region; 100 km [approx. 62 mi] southwest of Antananarivo).

Plague is endemic in Madagascar and cases are reported nearly every year between the months of September and April. The last outbreak was from August 2016 to January 2017.

[The circumstances around the cases, mostly occurring on the eastern, a non-endemic part, of the island nation are clearer at this point.

Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy producing the purpura seen in the "Black Plague" and also spread to the lung causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission. - Mod.LL
