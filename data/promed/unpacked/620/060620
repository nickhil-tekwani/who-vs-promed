Cold Stone ice cream linked to salmonella
---------------------------------------------
5 people in Washington have contracted food poisoning after eating
cake batter-flavored ice cream from Cold Stone Creamery stores.

The victims -- a woman in King County, a man in Whatcom County, 2
girls in Snohomish County and a woman in Spokane -- were infected
with a strain of the salmonella bacteria called _Salmonella
typhimurium_ (_Salmonella enterica_ serotype typhimurium), according
to the state Department of Health.

Cold Stone Creamery is voluntarily recalling the ice cream from its
stores throughout the country.

A teenage girl in Snohomish County was hospitalized briefly, but has
recovered, according to state officials.

A total of 15 cases of salmonellosis related to the ice cream shops
have been reported in 4 states, the others being Oregon, Minnesota
and Ohio, during the past month [June 2005].

contamination, which occurred, presumably, after the milk was
pasteurized. - Mod.LL]
