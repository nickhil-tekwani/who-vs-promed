A young man became the 5th fatal victim of [a] hantavirus so far this year [2012], confirmed the Subsecretary of Health, Jorge Diaz. "A young man of 22 years resided in the Metropolitan region, but he went to a rural area in the BioBio region, where, according to the investigation, is probably where he was infected," Diaz stated.

The Subsecretary added that the young man was interned in the Davila Clinic, "He arrived in Santiago and presented with symptoms and later he developed a very, very difficult and very complex condition, where all available technology was used, but he could not survive."

The [health] authority also confirmed that there are a total of 21 hantavirus [infection] cases in the entire country, mostly concentrated in BioBio.

Epidemiological investigations of the Health Authority detected abundant evidence of the presence of rodents, such as urine and fresh feces in an unoccupied house in a lot in Lanco, where a 5 year old girl -- confirmed as a patient with [a] hantavirus [infection] -- was together with her family.

The Hantavirus advisor of the Los Rios Health SEREMI, Rita Mansilla, confirmed the place, surrounded by various fruit trees, as the most likely place where the girl was infected.

According to the health official, the unoccupied house is permanently locked. Also, there are organic wastes in the fruit orchard that is located immediately around the house, where the hantavirus[es] may be present [in rodent hosts].

The girl remains hospitalized without respiratory deficiency and with favorable progress in the Valdivia Base Hospital. The health authority maintains epidemiological surveillance of the 4 family members who were also in the lot [around the house], the probable focus of the infection.

Also, there is ongoing monitoring of the family members of an adult from Corral who is a confirmed case of hantavirus [infection] and who, according to epidemiological investigations, had contracted the virus [infection] in his home.
