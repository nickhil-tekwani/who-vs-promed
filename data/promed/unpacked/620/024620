[Below is the text of an e-mail received by OIE on 8 Apr 2000 from Dr
Angel Omar Flores Hernandez, Director General of Animal Health, Secretariat
for Agriculture, Animal Production and Rural Development, Mexico City. The
text has many details of the extent of the outbreak. - Mod.PC
End of previous report period: 31 March 2000 (see Disease Information, 13
[13, dated 7 Apr 2000).
End of this report period: 7 Apr 2000.
On 30 Mar 2000, the isolation of velogenic Newcastle disease virus in the
metropolitan area of La Laguna was officially confirmed.
To date, 28 broiler farms (totalling 3 947 187 birds) have been placed
under quarantine. In some of these farms the disease has been confirmed by
virus isolation or clinical examination, whereas in the remainder the
disease is suspected. Eight farms (with a total of 1 236 650 birds) have
been depopulated. In nine farms (with a total of 1 437 628 birds)
eradication procedures are under way; in three of these farms, depopulation
is due to be completed within two days of this report and in six farms
within four days. In the remaining farms under quarantine investigations
are in progress.
To assess the overall situation, testing has been carried out in 130 farms
(49% of the total number of poultry farms in the region), including broiler
and breeding flocks and commercial layer flocks.
Testing is also under way in backyard flocks; to date, 265 samples have
been taken from 77 farms, and are currently being tested.
Since 31 March, the following control measures have been taken:
- The National Animal Health Emergency Plan has been put into effect and
the entire area of La Laguna has been placed under quarantine.
- Farms where the virus has been isolated and those where clinical signs of
Newcastle disease have been observed have been depopulated.
- Strict control measures on the movement of birds and poultry products and
by-products from the area of La Laguna to the rest of the country and
within the area itself have been established under official supervision.
- An epidemiological evaluation is being carried out in each farm to
determine the existing or potential level of risk.
- The most stringent animal health restrictions have been applied to farms
in the outbreak area and surrounding areas.
- Testing, and the epidemiological investigation into the origin of the
problem, are continuing.
