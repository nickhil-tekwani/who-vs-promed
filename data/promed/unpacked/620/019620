More than 15 000 people in southern Thailand have fallen ill with a
mosquito [borne] virus known as chikungunya disease, a disease control
official says. Disease Control Department head Somchai Chakrabhand said the
virus spread by mosquitoes has infected 15 240 people in 15 of Thailand's
southern provinces to date, The Bangkok Post reported Friday [15 May 2009].
Despite the number of infected individuals, the Public Health Ministry
remains confident the outbreak can be contained, Somchai added.

But the disease control official did recognize how a current shortage of
health staff in Thailand could pose problems when dealing with outbreaks of
diseases like Chikungunya or the H1N1 swine flu virus.

Thai officials are attempting to contain the mosquito virus through
enhanced surveillance measures, as well as providing information to the
public about the disease. The Post said information will also be dispersed
regarding how best to destroy suspected mosquito breeding grounds to limit
any future spread of the disease.

[Chikungunya virus infections are spreading in the southern provinces of
Thailand, while they continue across the border in northern Malaysia (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20090515.1820). One hopes that the control measures
will halt the spread northward up the peninsula. It would be of interest to
know if the mosquitoes transmitting chikungunya virus in southern Thailand
are _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_, or both species.
