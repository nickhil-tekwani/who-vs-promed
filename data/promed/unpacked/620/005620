KS was one of the two AIDS-defining lesions at the onset of the epidemic
in 1981 and remains the most common malignancy in HIV-infected persons
(1). The highest prevalence in the US is in white homosexual and
bisexual men, but the incidence has decreased in recent years.
There is a long-standing controversy regarding the etiology and the cell
of origin of this multicentric tumor. A number of viruses have been
proposed as putative causes including CMV [cytomegalovirus, human
papilloma virus and currently herpes hominis virus 8 [HHV-8 and
Epstein-Barr virus [EBV. The tumor cells are plump to elongated
spindle cells arranged haphazardly.
Mitosis, necrosis, and nuclear pleomorphism are rare. The clefts or
vascular slit-like spaces may contain red blood cells or hemosiderin.
PAS-positive intracytoplasmic hyaline globules can be found, but they
are not pathognomonic (2). Plasma cells and coarse granules of
hemosiderin are concentrated mostly at the periphery of the lesion. The
differential diagnosis includes bacillary angiomatosis and the
inflammatory pseudotumors (e.g., vasoproliferation following acute
toxoplasmosis and spindle cell mycobacterial lesions)(3). Appropriate
special stains should rule out infectious agents.

[Thanks for this, Cynthia. So the question appears to be still open as
to whether KS is caused by EBV, as I thought, or HHV-8 or some other
virus - Mod.JW
