[1] Cholera - Sudan (Northern Bahr al-Ghazal)

Cholera has seen a resurgence in southern Sudan, where 20 have died
over the weekend [2-3 Aug 208] following heavy rains that drove
hundreds of thousands from their homes, a local official said on
Monday [4 Aug 2008].

Cholera, which has been in decline in southern Sudan until recent
rains, has infected almost 6000 people in the region and killed at
least 44 in 2008 in other parts of the semi-autonomous region.

"So far, 20 people died of a disease believed to be cholera over the
weekend and many others are now admitted in Aweil hospital," said Tong
Aken Ngor a member of parliament for the Aweil area of the Northern
Bahr al-Ghazal state in southern Sudan. Ngor said some 250 000 people
had been made homeless due to heavy rains that caused flooding and
destroyed houses in the area.

Ngor said many people in the flooded areas had little food or shelter
and called for urgent international help. Southern Sudan is emerging
from a civil war after a peace treaty signed in 2005 that created an
autonomous government for the region.

A cholera outbreak in 2006 killed 700 people and affected around 25 000.

[2] Cholera - Guinea-Bissau

Guinea-Bissau's cholera epidemic has spread through the entire
country, with cases reported in every region. Health workers now say
they fear it will become worse. The 1st cases were reported in May
2008 in the southern region of Tombali. In July 2008, a number of
cases were diagnosed in the capital, Bissau, and hundreds were
treated at the central hospital there.

Deputy Country Representative for UNICEF [United Nations Children's
Fund], Sylvana Nzirorera, says the epidemic has been difficult to
contain. "The cases keep increasing," Nzirorera said. "The last
figures I have from 30 Jul 2008, are 960 cases with 25 deaths. A
subject of concern is that it is progressing, despite the efforts we
are putting in."

Nzirorera says cases have now been reported in all of Guinea-Bissau's
regions. She says the majority of the most serious cases have been in
the capital.

Health services and NGOs [non-governmental organizations] are working
to contain the epidemic to avoid a situation similar to that of 2005,
when cholera infected 25 000 and killed 400. Nzirorera said it is
worrisome that the disease has spread so broadly.

A total of 18 people have died as a result of a cholera outbreak in 2
tribal communities in Palimbang, Sultan Kudarat. The victims were
residents of the hamlets of Sagpaw and Biao in Barangay Milbuk, which
are Manobo communities.

The 1st victims of the cholera outbreak were initially reported by
the villagers last week [28 Jul-3 Aug 2008] when several people
started complaining of diarrhea. The 2 hamlets are located several
kilometers away from the Milbuk village proper. Residents have to
walk down from their mountain location to reach the village health
center.

An acute diarrheal disease has recurred in Thanh Hoa province. The 1st
patient who tested positive to the cholera bacterium in the province
lives in the Truong Son ward, Thanh Hoa city. Earlier, the patient was
on board a ship to go out to sea with 5 fishermen who later suffered
from acute diarrhea.

After that 12 more people were reported sick with the disease, 6 of
whom tested positive for cholera.

In late July 2008, some patients with acute diarrhea were reported in
Hai Ha, Truong Lam, Hai Thuong, and Nghi Son communes of Tinh Gia
district, thus bringing the total of patients in the province to 19,
13 of whom tested positive for cholera.

As many as 9 children died and dozens of others fell sick due to an
outbreak of diarrhea that spread at Syada village in Humala district
in mid-western Nepal recently, The Kathmandu Post reported on Monday
[4 Aug 2008].

According to the daily, the outbreak has not yet been controlled due
to unavailability of medicine in the village. "Nearly 100 minors
[children] are now suffering from diarrhea in Syada, Sata, and Yangu
VDCs (village development committees)," VDC secretary Gajabir Rokaya
claimed.

Dr Srabesh Sharma at District Hospital, however, said he had no
knowledge of the outbreak.
