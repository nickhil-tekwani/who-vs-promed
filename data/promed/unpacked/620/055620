This resembles the recent multisource outbreak of C-CHF in the UAE
(1995-1996). The first case was then also reported from Fujairah (vet
surgeon with a history of a tick bite). Subsequently, approximately. 60
(clinical - some of the cases RT-PCR confirmed) cases occurred in several
places in the UAE. Some cases were also reported in neighbouring Oman
(phylogentically related to the C-CHFV strains in the UAE). Only some of
the cases were related to abattoirs, others with handling of fresh meat
(maid). However, in most of the cases, the mode of transmission remained
unknown. I wonder how UAE port officials plan to screen imported sheep,
goat or cattle in which C-CHFV infection is usually asymptomatic. Animal
markets (especially the famous camel market in Al Ain), which are a major
tourist attraction, may be a potential source to acquire the infection via
tick bites.

[This is important background information. Note the questionable 1998
reports reported by ProMED-mail. The question remains as to whether the
virus is enzootic in the UAE or whether all infections are the result of
importations. Wouldn't it be interesting if viruses were not enzootic
anywhere and all were imported from somewhere else? - Mod.CHC
