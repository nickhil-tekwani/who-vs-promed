13th case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Denmark (1st case
for 2004)
---------------------------------------------------
Information received on 15 Jun 2004 from Dr Preben Willeberg, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, Soborg:
Date of the report: 15 Jun 2004.
On 20 Apr 2004 a cow from central Jutland tested positive for BSE as part
of the routine surveillance of all fallen stock older than 24 months. The
animal was probably born in 1990.
Investigations into the feeding routines in the herd will be carried out in
an attempt to locate the possible source of infection [see commentary].
When this investigation has been completed, the number of the animals to be
killed and incinerated will be decided.
Due to the established slaughtering procedures, new cases of BSE will have
no implications on the safety of Danish bovine meat products.

[This case has already been reported in BSE update 2004 (04). Reportedly,
it was found in a dead beef cow, without typical clinical symptoms; the cow
had been part of 2 herds, totaling 150 animals, in the central area of the
Jutland peninsula in western Denmark.
To date, there have been 16 Danish-born BSE cases. 13 of the cases were
diagnosed in Denmark (2000-1; 2001-6; 2002-3; 2003-2, 2004-1). 2 were
diagnosed in Portugal and 1 was found in Italy. In 1992, there was one case
in a cow imported from Scotland.
Epidemiological investigations are conducted in Denmark on all BSE cases.
So far, however, the exact source of the infection has not been positively
identified in any case. The reader is referred to a recent paper by Larry
G. Paisley and Julie Hostrup-Pedersen, Danish Institute for Food and
Veterinary Research, published in Preventive Veterinary Medicine 63 (2004)
135Â­149: A quantitative assessment of the risk of transmission of BSE by
tallow-based calf milk-replacer. Its abstract follows.
"A Monte Carlo simulation model was constructed to assess the risk of BSE
transmission to calves by calf milk-replacer (CMR). We assumed that any BSE
infectivity in the CMR would be associated with the allowable levels of
impurities in tallow used to manufacture the milk-replacer.
Simulations used 3 different levels of impurities, 6 different
distributions of the BSE infectivity titers of CNS tissues and with and
without inclusion of specified risk material (SRM). Our results suggest
that tallow-based CMR could have been responsible for some BSE infections
in nearly all simulations.
The reduction in the allowable impurities in tallow and the exclusion of
SRM have greatly reduced -- but have not eliminated -- the risk of BSE
transmission by CMR. The results of the simulations are associated with
much uncertainty".
The speculated role of calf milk-replacers, which include cattle tallow, in
the epidemiology of BSE has been the subject of several ProMED-mail
postings (see refs). This is has relevance especially to countries which
have implemented severe and -- seemingly -- effective measures pertaining
to the use of meat-and-bone meals. Interestingly, EU's Scientific Steering
Committee has not classified cattle tallow derivatives as "not infectious"
(ref 20030426.1019). - Mod.AS]
