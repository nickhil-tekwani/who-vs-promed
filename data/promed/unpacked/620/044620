South Korea's farm ministry said Tuesday [28 Dec 2010] that it has
found 20 dead spectacled teal ducks, apparently affected by the
virulent strain of bird flu [HPAI H5N1], and have taken emergency
decontamination measures.

The discovery of the dead birds in Haenam, south of Seoul, is the 3rd
such finding this month [December 2010] and is raising concerns among
local poultry farmers.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza infection was confirmed in wild
birds in Nankai District, South Jeolla Province. This year [2010], the
highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) was detected in the
vast expanse of the Iksan river (7 days ago [?]), and in the Seosan
shallow bay (10 days ago [?]).

The South Jeolla Province authorities announced on 28 Nov 2010,
regarding some 1000 birds on Rock Lake in Hainan county, that 74
Baikal[?] dead birds had been found, and samples were taken from 20.
H5N1 virus was recovered from these samples.

Emergency disinfection teams were deployed throughout this
agricultural area, and a total movement stop was put into effect for
livestock, vehicles and people within a 10-km radius. Investigation
teams are visiting the 43 poultry farms subject to clinical testing
restrictions, which will be removed after 30 days.
