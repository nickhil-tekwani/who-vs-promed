[Professors Karin Stiasny (KS), and Franz X Heinz (FH) responded to comments made by Mods. ML and TY to their report on tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease in Austria (see Tick-borne encephalitis & Lyme disease - Austria: 2005-18 20210908.8653379). Their comments (KS, FH) follow the comments made by Mods. ML and TY]

KS,FH: We thank you for your interest in our paper and its thorough analysis. A few aspects addressed in your comments can be clarified as follows:

Mod.ML: It is clear that in this study the geographic location where tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme disease (LD) were acquired was assumed to be within the federal provinces where the patients reside. However, for both LD and TBE, it is important to obtain a thorough travel history from patients, as these diseases may be acquired in endemic areas other than where they reside and knowing the proportion that travel-related LD and TBE accounts for the documented cases is important. Nevertheless, even though questionnaires were sent to the treating physicians in the hospitals that requested information on the possible geographical site of infection, we are not told to what extent this information matched the location of the patient's residence.

KS,FH: As deduced from the questionnaires returned to the National Reference Laboratory, probable sites of TBE virus infection (that is, those cases for which reliable information was obtained) matched the location of the patients' places of residence at the level of Federal Provinces by 98%. Since the requirements for transmission (tick bites, outdoor activities) are identical for both TBE and LD, it is justified to assume that this number is similar for LD. In addition, travel histories can be expected to be similar for TBE and LD patients.

We are sorry for not having included this important information in the manuscript, and we are grateful for pointing to this omission. We have also sent this information to the Journal.

Mod.ML: Also, the study involved only hospitalized patients with TBE and LD. Only a minority of patients with LD require hospitalization. In the US, about 2800 patients with LD were hospitalized, usually because of carditis, arthritis, or neurologic involvement, between 2005 and 2014 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7521202/). Thus, only about 1% of the about 30 000 cases of LD reported each year (https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/index.html), are hospitalized in the US and perhaps in Austria. Thus, the observed findings in incidence rates of LD in Austria likely apply to only a very small fraction of all LD patients.

However, a much larger portion (20-30%) of patients with TBE develop central nervous system involvement, with symptoms of meningitis, encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis, that likely require hospitalization. As pointed out by the investigators of this study, the falling incidence of TBE is unlikely to be caused by TBE virus strains circulating in eastern Austria that have acquired mutations that reduce transmission or pathogenicity for humans, and thus reduce the frequency of hospitalization.

KS,FH: It is correct that we analyzed only hospitalized patients of LD and TBE, that is, only the tip of an iceberg of a much larger number of infections not leading to hospitalization (see the end of Introduction, page 3; https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.35.2002108). The proportion of the tip to the rest of the iceberg may differ between the 2 infections; the percentage of symptomatic TBE virus infections has been estimated to be in the range of 2-30% (Bogovic and Strle. Tick-borne encephalitis: A review of epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and management. World J Clin Cases. 2015. 3(5): 430-41; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419106/) or even as low as 1% (Suess J. Tick-borne encephalitis 2010: Epidemiology, risk areas, and virus strains in Europe and Asia -- An overview. Ticks Tick Borne Dis. 2011; 2(1): 2-15; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2010.10.007). Such differences, however, would not change the major result and important conclusion of the study, since hospitalized patients with both TBE and LD were infected by tick bites during outdoor activities.

Mod.TY: This report raises some critical questions: was the prevalence of TBE virus in vector ticks constant over the years, including in those localities where the incidence of human TBE cases declined? Was TBE virus vector the tick population in these areas decreasing, stable, or increasing? Was the proportion of the population vaccinated against TBE increasing in localities where hospitalized TBE patients were decreasing?

KS,FH responded: To exclude any vaccination-associated effects we included only cases in unvaccinated individuals in our study (Methods page 3: calculation of incidence rates; Results, page 5: 1st paragraph), that is, the changes observed are not influenced by the obvious decline of the overall incidences through vaccination, as documented previously (Heinz et al, Emerging Infectious Diseases 2013 and Eurosurveillance 2015).

Mod.TY concluded: Had TBE virus transmission efficiency of vector ticks changed over time in any of the localities? Is that efficiency altered for local TBE virus strains with increasing temperature?

[ProMED thanks Professors Karin Stiasny and Franz X Heinz for their comments and clarifications. One hopes that their report will stimulate follow-up studies on the prevalence and transmission efficiency of TBE virus in tick vectors. - Mod.TY
