ROME -- Italy's 17th case of "mad cow" disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), was confirmed by the national institute for
research into spongiform encephalopathies in Turin. The animal
concerned was 14 years old and discovered in Aosta in the north.
A total of 17 BSE cases have been detected in Italy since it launched
its testing program for the fatal brain-wasting disease in January, in
compliance with European Union regulations.
All animals over 30 months old now have to be tested. So far, over 100
000 tests have been carried out.

The French government has lowered the age at which cattle must be
tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) from 30 months to 24
months, according to France's Agriculture Ministry.
Additionally, beginning tomorrow, all cows aged 24 months and older
will be tested for BSE before being slaughtered, the ministry added.
According to the ministry, between 1 Jan and 15 Jul 2001, more than
one million cows were tested for BSE. Of those tested, 31 infected
cows were detected.
