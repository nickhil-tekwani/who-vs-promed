The State Veterinary Service (SVS) of the Azerbaijani Agriculture Ministry has called for more vigilance at customs posts and trade centers due to an outbreak of anthrax in neighboring Georgia, a spokesman of the SVS, Yolchu Khanveli, said, Trend reports. No response to the request for information on anthrax has been given.

Imports of Georgian cattle and meat are permitted with vaccination. Imports need 21 days of quarantine. No cases of anthrax have been registered in Azerbaijan so far. 2 389 681 cattle, 7 041 396 small cattle, 106 421 one-hoofed animals, and 5880 pigs have been vaccinated.

30 people in Georgia, 20 of whom are Azerbaijanis, have been infected with anthrax.

[There are no reports by the OIE of any anthrax outbreaks in recent weeks except for one in relation to La Guajira in Colombia, nor of any human cases in Georgia or Azerbaijan. This is not to say that such events have not occurred or are not occurring. I would hazard a guess that Azerbaijanis in Georgia have been writing home recounting these events. But whatever it takes to get folks to be more aware and livestock vaccinated, so be it.

The disease is infrequent in Azerbaijan, with single outbreaks recorded in 2006, 2007 (with 17 human cases), 2008 (with 12 human cases), and a single human case with no reported livestock cases in 2010; no human or livestock cases were reported in 2011. Unfortunately, the disease is more active in Georgia and with significant numbers of human cases: 2006 (38 human cases); 2007 (42); 2008 (62); 2009 (38); 2010 (28); and 2011 (81 with one death). - Mod.MHJ
