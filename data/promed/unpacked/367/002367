On 11 September 1997 a 37 year old man of African ethnic origin was
admitted to hospital in Mainz, Germany, with fever, liver failure,
rhabdomyolysis, thrombocytopenia, and a haemorrhagic diathesis. Shortly
after admission, he was transferred to an isolation room in the intensive
care unit. During the next eight days his condition deteriorated, his
bleeding diathesis worsened, and he died on 20 September of multiple organ
failure. Preliminary results from a necropsy conducted on 23 September by
the Institute of Pathology of the Eberhard Karls University in TÃ¼bingen
indicated that the patient had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
acute yellow atrophy of the liver, renal failure, and rhabdomyolysis.
During his stay in hospital, extensive testing for bacterial and viral
pathogens all yielded negative results. Viral haemorrhagic fever was
suspected because of his fever, bleeding diathesis, fulminant clinical
course, and a possible history of recent travel from West Africa (Ghana) in
August. On 18 September, testing for viral haemorrhagic fever pathogens was
performed at the Bernhard Nocht Institute in Hamburg. All results were
negative except for those relating to Lassa fever. An immunofluorescence
assay (IFA) for Lassa fever was negative, but a direct polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) for Lassa fever showed fragments, a nested PCR was negative,
and an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for IgM antibody against Lassa
fever was positive (1:1000). The testing laboratory interpreted the results
as suspicious for Lassa fever. On the basis of these initial results and
the compatible clinical history, active surveillance for the development of
fever or symptoms of Lassa fever among close personal contacts of the
patient and relevant health care personnel began. The hospital intensive
care unit was disinfected. On 25 September, the results of viral cultures
from patient samples were confirmed negative for haemorrhagic fever viruses
and active surveillance of community contacts and health care personnel was
discontinued. Parallel antibody testing and viral cultures for haemorrhagic
fever viruses conducted at the Centre of Hygiene and Medical Microbiology
of the Marburg University were also negative. The epidemiological
investigation revealed that the patient had in fact not recently traveled
outside Europe.
Pending further results from the necropsy, the cause of the patient's
illness remains unknown. If you know of other similar cases with acute
liver dysfunction and rhabdomyolysis of unknown aetiology, particularly in
the last six months, please contact Dr Angela Ammon at the Robert Koch
Institute (+49 30 4547 3481).
[Assuming specimens from the patient were tested for hantaviruses, might
any of our subscribers have diagnostically-useful ideas about this case? --
