The referenced source for the ProMED post below does not mention _E.
coli_ O157 infection. Other pathogenic phenotypes of _E. coli_ are
often responsible for sporadic or outbreak associated illnesses. In
Australia, non-O157 STEC (Shiga toxin producing _E. coli_)
serogroups, such as O111, have been responsible for outbreaks. Did
you independently determine that _E. coli_ O157 has been confirmed
among these 10 Australian cases?

[ProMED thanks Peter Evans for his comments. Below is a parallel
posting that specifically mentions O157. Additionally, Dr. Ann
Koehler, who is the Director, Communicable Disease Control Branch of
Dept of Health of South Australia, had written about the previously
reported cases in ProMED [Hemolytic uremic syndrome - Australia
(SA)(02) 20070128.0366]:
"It has not yet been established that the 3 cases are genetically
matched, they are similar. We are running further tests to determine
how closely they are related....The case with hemolytic uremic
syndrome was not one of the confirmed _E. coli_ O157 cases."

A strain of _E. coli_ is baffling South Australian health
authorities, with 10 cases of the bacterium recorded in the past
month [January-February 2007].
In the most recent wave of infections, 3 people have been confirmed
with cases of the possibly deadly O157 strain since the weekend
[10-11 Feb 2007].
State director of Public Health Kevin Buckett said on Tue 13 Feb
2007, that no link had been established between the patients who
range in age from 2 to 81 years and live across Adelaide. One of the
most recent diagnoses was in a rural town, where 3 people reported
symptoms of the infection in January 2007, followed by 4 more 2 weeks
ago beginning of February 2007].
Dr. Buckett said the cases had no common source of infection such as
a supermarket or restaurant that had been identified. Each patient
had been in good health and [eaten] a wide variety of food.
"There is nothing that we can grab hold of and say here is a
something that we need to focus on," Dr. Buckett told reporters. He
said the investigation would focus on finding a link between widely
available foods including meat, fruit, and vegetables that could
carry the bacterium.
