[The latest PowerPoint report on highly pathogenic avian influenza in Germany, presented on 29-30 Nov 2022 at the ScoPAFF (Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food, and Feed) meeting to the EC, can be seen at https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-12/reg-com_ahw_20221129_hpai_deu_0.pdf.

Summary of this PowerPoint report:
- "Number of cases in wild birds has increased significantly.
- Migration is still on-going and the infection pressure in the wild bird population will increase further.
- Number of HPAI outbreaks in poultry and captive birds still relatively low.
- Biosecurity measures in place.
- The activity of trade establishments has to be effectively controlled.
- Still essential: Awareness, knowledge, functional structures, preparation, resources, traceability". - Mod.CRD]

[The high pathogenicity avian influenza situation report No 36, published by WOAH on 2 Dec 2022, mentioned that: "The current HPAI epidemic season continues with about 90 outbreaks being reported in poultry and about the same number in non-poultry birds over the 3 weeks covered by the report (11 Nov to 1 Dec 2022), mainly in Europe, and also in the Americas and Asia. Many of the countries in these regions are experiencing a larger number of outbreaks compared to last year's (2021) wave at the same time. Outbreaks are also spreading further to South American countries. Over 1.3 million birds died or were culled worldwide during the 3 week period. The predominant subtype noticed in the current epidemic season is still subtype H5N1. It is worth highlighting the 1st occurrence of HPAI in Peru and Ecuador. As of 2 Dec 2022, in Peru, the disease was detected in wild birds and in Ecuador, the disease was detected in poultry. HPAI cases in humans from Spain were also reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 3 Nov 2022. The detection of influenza A (H5N1) in these individuals was likely due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Based on the HPAI seasonal pattern, the number of outbreaks in animals is expected to rise in the coming months. The World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) recommends that countries maintain their surveillance efforts, biosecurity measures at farm level, and continue timely reporting of avian influenza outbreaks in both poultry and non-poultry species. High quality of information is key to support early detection and rapid response to potential threats to both animal and public health."
