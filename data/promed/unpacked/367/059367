A human death from anthrax has been registered in Romania. Laboratory
investigation has confirmed that a 45-year-old shepherd, who died on Friday
[6 May 2005] in a hospital in the City of Piatra-Neamt in [the county, or
judet, of Neamt] the northeast of the country, had been infected the
anthrax. The patient was admitted into the hospital on 3 May 2005.
Infection by _Bacillus anthracis_ had taken place through a cut on a
finger; the patient died of a systemic infection of the blood. All people
who had contact with the deceased shepherd (about 40 persons) have been
inoculated. Hospital rooms occupied by the patient, as well as his house
and a work cabinet, were disinfected.
Examination indicates that all animals owned by the shepherd are healthy
and have [been] inoculated against anthrax. Anthrax bacteria can survive in
the ground, in blood, and in leather for 55 years. The last case of anthrax
infection in the area was reported in 2003.

[Human cutaneous cases directly from contaminated soil are frankly rare.
The more usual backstory to such claimed events is that the affected person
was involved in butchering a sick animal; for fear of the legal
repercussions of failing reporting that the animal was sick and selling
said meat in a local market, the true events get covered up. There is a
steady pitter-patter of sporadic anthrax outbreaks and cases in Romania in
spite of some 3.5 million cattle and over 9 million sheep and goats being
vaccinated each year. Their control programme needs a critical
re-examination to determine why it is not more cost-effective.
Human cutaneous anthrax cases carry a 10 percent risk of lethality,
especially if treatment is delayed or missed; prompt early treatment with
appropriate antibiotics is virtually 100 percent successful. However, once
a systemic infection has set in, death is almost inevitable in humans.
Comments on this case have been requested from my Romanian contacts. - Mod.MHJ]
