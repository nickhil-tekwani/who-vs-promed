A man who was confirmed to have measles while staying at the Palace Hotel in Fords has recovered, and no other cases have been reported, according to hotel management. "Everybody's fine right now, no problem," said Nimeshi Matate, manager of the hotel at 1050 King Georges Post Road [New Jersey]. State Department of Health (DOH) spokeswoman Dawn Thomas confirmed that the agency received blood specimens from staff at the hotel and that the individuals were deemed immune to measles because they had been vaccinated against the virus.

The case of measles was confirmed after a member of a 15-person musical group staying at the hotel fell ill and was hospitalized, according to Matate. The group stayed at the Palace Hotel from 25-30 Sep 2014, she said. The patient had recently come from London, though he resides in Sri Lanka, she said. Matate said the man had a high fever while staying at the hotel, and he left to receive medical care. "The whole group is fine," she said, adding that the group went on to play shows in Washington, D.C. and Canada after leaving New Jersey.

Hotel management reached out to travel agents who had coordinated plans for 3 groups from China who were staying at the hotel at the time, according to Matate. The DOH issued a public health alert on 4 Oct 2014, recommending that all who had visited the hotel -- not the banquet hall -- during the specified dates contact a health care provider immediately. According to the DOH, anyone exposed to measles at the Palace Hotel could develop symptoms -- which include rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes -- as late as 21 Oct 2014. New Jersey Health Commissioner Mary E. O'Dowd urged the public to get up to date on the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, as well as all other age-appropriate immunizations.

[An unusual history involving a single player among a group of musicians travelling from London through New Jersey to engagements in Washington DC and Canada. The measles case had been resident in Sri Lanka (the likely source of the virus) before joining this group. Other musicians passing through New Jersey at the same time have been traced and warned of the measles infection risk if not previously vaccinated. Cases may yet appear in New Jersey up to mid-October 2014 among any unvaccinated individuals passing though the New Jersey Hotel. The hotel seems to have behaved correctly and retrospectively warned all unvaccinated travellers staying at the hotel during this period. In general, travellers to and from any part of the world should ensure that their measles vaccinations are up-to-date. - Mod.CP]

Measles was considered to be eliminated (from the USA) in 2000. But we've seen a rise in the disease. According to the CDC, the number of measles cases this year [2014] has already reached a 20-year high.

"We know these outbreaks are driven or started by children or individuals who have not been vaccinated or who actively refused vaccines. And the consequences of their decisions are huge," said Dr. Jana Shaw, Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital pediatric infectious disease specialist. In fact, 90 percent of the measles cases this year [2014] are in people who weren't vaccinated. Parents often refuse vaccines for a number of reasons, including concerns about safety, distrust with government, and a belief that it's better for children to build up a natural immunity.

Dr. Jana Shaw says some younger parents don't get their children vaccinated because they didn't grow up in a time where children were ravaged by these vaccine-preventable infections. In order for a child to go to school, they must have a certain set of vaccinations, but in New York, they can get either a medical exemption or religious belief exemption. Over the last decade, doctors have seen a steady increase in the number of children getting exemptions. In a study this year [2014], Dr. Shaw found exemption rates in private schools were twice as high as in public schools. She says research shows they're often requested by more educated and affluent families.

"From my personal experience, that might be because they feel they know better. They feel they've done their own research. They feel they're educated enough and can make their own decisions," said Shaw. We spoke with both a public and private school in Central New York. Each said they only had a handful of students who have either medical or religious exemptions. "The consequence would be that if there was some type of outbreak, the child would not be able to be in school," said Br. Joseph Jozwiak, Christian Brothers Academy principal. Doctors have already planned a follow-up study to see what they can do to curb these exemption rates.

The Department of Infection Prevention and Control (IP&C) at New York-Presbyterian Hospital collaborated with other departments to harness information technology (IT) during a measles outbreak earlier this year [2014] -- including text message alerts to vulnerable patients -- to prevent the spread of the disease. The findings were presented today [9 Oct 2014] at the IDWeek 2014 meeting.

Measles is a highly contagious airborne virus that was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000. However, a surge in measles cases was seen in 2014 with 592 confirmed cases to date, including 26 in New York City between 5 Feb and 29 Apr 2014. 13 of these patients were treated at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. To help stem the outbreak, the hospital's IP&C team used IT resources to minimise measles exposures, manage suspected cases and increase vaccination rates.

As the measles outbreak unfolded, IP&C identified 537 patients who may have been exposed to the virus. To determine their vaccination status, New York-Presbyterian synchronized its immunization registry with New York City's and found that 287 patients had either no immunity or an unknown immune status. An alert was put into these patients' electronic health records to ensure that the medical staff were aware of the patient's exposure status and the isolation requirements should the patient return to New York-Presbyterian. The electronic health records also contained measles order sets, which included links to the Department of Health specimen collection forms to facilitate testing of suspect cases of measles.

In fact, 20 percent of the potentially exposed patients returned to New York-Presbyterian Hospital for primary care or for care of other health issues while they were potentially infectious for measles[?]. Due to the alerts in the electronic health records and the other interventions taken, there were no healthcare-associated measles cases during this outbreak at the hospital. "The IT resources mobilized during this outbreak were an invaluable resource in communicating our infection prevention and control plan to frontline staff," said Maria Messina, RN, IP&C, New York-Presbyterian/Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, and lead researcher on the study. "We were also able to communicate important information about the epidemiology of the outbreak across the healthcare system."

New York-Presbyterian was also proactive in increasing vaccination rates in the community during the outbreak. Using its immunization registry, the hospital identified 266 children one to 6 years of age who had not yet received a measles vaccine. The hospital sent text messages to these families urging them to have their children vaccinated immediately. The texts included walk-in hours as well. To date, 48 percent of those children have received their measles vaccination.
