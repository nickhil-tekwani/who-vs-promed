The Barnwell hospital has announced the 1st case in 2012 [of a chikungunya virus infection], treated on 11 Jan [2012], according to the minister of health [of the Island of Mauritius]. The patient is aged over 60 and was hospitalised for 3 days at Moka. He lives in the region of Ebene.

The minister of health says everything has been set in motion to fumigate around the ill man's residence. Private doctors ask the population to take precautions against the breeding sites of mosquitoes, which transmit this virus infection by their bites [only female mosquitoes bite].

[There have been isolated cases as well as outbreaks of chikungunya virus infection on the Island of Mauritius in recent years. The last reported cases were in January last year (2011). One hopes that the above case is another isolated one and not the index case of an impending outbreak.

Chikungunya is an Alphavirus of the Togaviridae family, transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes. The above report makes no mention of the relative abundance of these vector mosquitoes on Mauritius at the present time. - Mod.TY
