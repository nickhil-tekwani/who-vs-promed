[The information above, from a reliable source, is cause for grave concern. The Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated territories on earth. On top of the human population, estimated at 1.6-2.0 million, there are numerous backyard poultry holdings. The HPAI H5N1 virus strain involved is, most likely, similar or identical to the one circulating in Egypt. A significant increase in human infection has been observed in Egypt since the beginning of November 2014. Since the beginning of 2015, as of 31 Mar 2015, Egypt reported to the WHO 125 human cases, of which 33 (26.4 percent) died. The total number of cases reported there during the month of March 2015 stands at 30 cases, including 4 deaths (see 20150409.3287821).

International support to the Veterinary and Public Health authorities in Gaza to control the epizootic seems vital. Since stamping out seems to be out of the question, public education is essential and, probably, mass vaccination of poultry deserves to be included in the considerations.

A map showing the location of Khan Yunis is available at the source URL above.

Official confirmation, and genotyping, are anticipated. - Mod.AS
