[In reply to Moderator CHC's questions:
1) We don't know the identity of the arthropod vector(s). When we were
certain to be in the presence of the West Nile virus it was too late [to
make collections, due to the first cold of autumnal season.
2) Yes, we conducted a serosurvey and complement fixation tests on blood
samples taken at approximately 3-week intervals, from a statistically
significant number of horses in the affected areas. The results showed a
seroconversion (infection ratio varying from 1:32 and 1:118 became varying
from 1:4 and 1:8). [I do not understand this at all. - Mod.CHC. At
present we are doing an analogous survey on horses living outside
stud-farms where the six horses died.
3) No WNV related human disease case has been reported by the local human
health department since the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale in
Teramo, on 03 Oct., [indicated the horses were infected with WN virus.
That department, I suppose, didn't consider it appropriate to conduct
serological or other tests on humans.
4) I don't know anything about the work of Pasteur Institute in Paris
regarding the genomic sequence of Italian WNV and its possible relation
with other [WN virus isolates from other areas (Egypt, South Africa
Romania etc.). Perhaps Dr. [Vincent Deubel will [send some of his results
for posting on ProMED-mail as he completes them.

[As mentioned in previous posting about other infections, the
complement-fixation test can be quite useful in determining recent
infections. When spring comes, and serosurveys are done, I assume
neutralization or IgG ELISAs will be used. This also would be a rare
opportunity to determine the longevity of IgM antibody persistence and,
with the collaboration of people involved in human diagnostic virology, the
rate of human infections, if any, as well as the longevity of IgM antibody
persistence in such humans as might have been infected. Should be an
interesting, as well as beautiful, spring in northern Italy. - Mod.CHC
