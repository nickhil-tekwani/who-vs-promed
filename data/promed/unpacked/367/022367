Abstract
The zoonotic origin of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still unknown. Animal experiments have shown that nonhuman primates, cats, ferrets, hamsters, rabbits, and bats can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in felids, mink, and dogs in the field. Here, we describe an in-depth investigation of outbreaks on 16 mink farms and humans living or working on these farms, using whole-genome sequencing. We conclude that the virus was initially introduced from humans and has evolved, most likely reflecting widespread circulation among mink in the beginning of the infection period several weeks prior to detection. At the moment, despite enhanced biosecurity, early warning surveillance, and immediate culling of infected farms, there is ongoing transmission between mink farms with 3 big transmission clusters with unknown modes of transmission. We also describe the 1st animal-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in mink farms.

[The exhaustive and detailed paper, addressing the Dutch COVID-19 human-to-mink-to-human event, is based upon data collected up to 26 Jun 2020 from 16 mink farms. Since then, 28 additional farms have been found infected: on 2 Sep 2020, the Dutch authorities published the detection of the 44th infected mink farm, located in the community of Gemert-Bakel, North Brabant (https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19/nieuws/2020/09/02/nieuwe-besmetting-covid-19-bij-nertsenbedrijf). The (around) 5000 breeding animals are to be culled, similarly to all minks kept on the 43 farms infected previously.

For a map showing all municipalities in the Netherlands in which mink farms have been operational in 2019, as well as the number of farms per municipality, see supplement 1 of the paper; municipalities with SARS-CoV-2-affected farms (by 21 Jun 2020) are shown in red.

The following 2 chapters, extracted from the paper, are presented for subscribers' convenience (references omitted); visiting the full text is recommended.

1. Zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2
----------------------------------------------
"On mink farm NB3, SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed on 7 May 2020. Initially, all 7 employees tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, but when retested between 19 and 26 May [2020], after developing COVID-19-related symptoms, 5 out of 7 individuals working or living on the farm tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) were obtained from these 5 individuals, and the clustering of these sequences with the sequences derived from mink from NB3, together with initial negative test result and the start of the symptoms, indicate that the employees were infected with SARS-CoV-2 after the mink on the farm got infected. Also, an additional infection was observed based on contact tracing: a close contact of one of the employees -- who did not visit the farm -- got infected with the SARS-CoV-2 strain found on NB3. Animal and human sequences from farm NB3 were related to those from farm NB1, but were both part of cluster A.

"Similarly, on mink farm NB7, zoonotic transmission from mink to human most likely occurred. On this farm, SARS-CoV-2 infection in mink was diagnosed on 31 May [2020], and employees initially tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 but started to develop symptoms at a later stage. Samples were taken between 10 Jun and 1 Jul [2020] from 10 employees, of which 8 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. From 2 samples, WGS could be generated from the employees, which clustered together with the sequences from the animals from this farm.

2. Discussion
-------------
"Here we show ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in mink farms and spill-over events to humans. To the best of our knowledge, these are the 1st animal-to-human SARS-CoV-2 transmission events documented. More research in minks and other mustelid species, to demonstrate if these species can be a true reservoir of SARS-CoV-2, although from our observations we consider this likely. After the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on mink farms, 68% of the tested farm workers and/or relatives or contacts were shown to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected mink is a risk factor for contracting COVID-19.

"A high diversity in the sequences from some mink farms was observed, which most likely can be explained by many generations of infected animals before an increase in mortality was observed. The current estimates [based upon COVID-19 observations in humans] are that the substitution rate of SARS-CoV-2 corresponds to around one mutation per 2 weeks. This could mean that the virus was already circulating in mink farms for some time. However, there was also a relatively high sequence diversity observed in farms that still tested negative one week [earlier], hinting towards a faster evolution of the virus in the mink population. This can indicate that the virus might replicate more efficiently in mink or might have acquired mutations that make the virus more virulent. However, no specific mutations were found in all mink samples, making increased virulence less likely. In addition, mink farms have large populations of animals that could lead to very efficient virus transmission.

"Generation intervals for SARS-CoV-2 in humans have been estimated to be around 4-5 days, but with high dose exposure in a high-density farm could potentially be shorter.

"Recently, a specific mutation in the spike protein (D614G) was shown to result in an increased virulence in vitro, while not associated with increased growth rate for cluster nor increased mortality. This mutation was present in farm clusters A, C, and E, but no obvious differences in clinical presentation, disease severity, or rate of transmission to humans were observed.

"While we found sequences matching the animal sequences on several farms, not all of these can be considered direct zoonotic transmissions. For instance, the 2 employees from mink farm NB3 were most likely infected while working at the mink farm, given the specific clustering in the phylogenetic tree and the timing of infection. Subsequent human infections may have originated from additional zoonotic infections, or from human-to-human transmission within their household. Further proof that animals were the most likely source of infection was provided by the clear phylogenetic separation between farm-related human cases and animal cases, from sequences from cases within the same 4-digit postal code area.

"Spill-back into the community living in the same 4-digit postal code area was not observed using sequence data, but cannot be entirely ruled out as the testing strategy during April and May [2020] was focusing on healthcare workers, persons with more severe symptoms, and persons at risk for complications, rather than monitoring community transmission and milder cases.

"While the number of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals was decreasing in the Netherlands in May and June [2020], an increase in detection of SARS-CoV-2 in mink farms was observed. Based on WGS, these sequences are part of multiple individual transmission chains linked to the mink farms and are not a reflection of the situation in the human population during this time. In some cases, the farms had the same owner but in other cases no epidemiological link could be established. People coming to the different farms might be a source, but also semi-wild cats roaming around the farms or wildlife might play a role. So far, the investigation failed to identify common factors that might explain farm-to-farm spread.

"During interviews, it became clear that farms had occasionally hired temporary workers that had not been included in the testing and were lost to follow-up, stressing the need for vigorous biosecurity and occupational health guidance. Since our observation, SARS-CoV-2 infections have also been described in mink farms in Denmark, Spain, and the USA, and mink farming is common in other regions of the world as well, [including] China, where around 26 million mink pelts are produced on a yearly basis. The population size and the structure of mink farms is such that it is conceivable that SARS-CoV-2 -- once introduced -- could continue to circulate. Therefore, continued monitoring and cooperation between human and animal health services is crucial to prevent the animals serving as a reservoir for continued infection in humans."

The above paper deserves the attention of all involved in studies into the epidemiology of COVID-19, origin, animal health, and zoonotic potential. Its weight is underlined by the extensive application of whole-genome sequencing, allowing in-depth analysis of the virus' evolution on the mink farms, in animal and man. The mechanism of the continued spread of the virus in the Netherlands' mink farms is yet to be unravelled.

The possible role of minks in the pandemic is a matter of some concern, requiring further studies, which should incorporate, as the authors plead, also other mink-producing countries, in particular China. Interestingly, Chinese authors published, in January 2020, a study into infectivity patterns of viruses hosted on many vertebrates, leading them to conclude that "infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be 2 candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov" (Ref 1). While this conclusion might be argued, it should encourage China's scientific community to attend the situation in the local mink industry, starting with serosurveillance.

The observations included in the current paper have been used as basis for the recent Dutch government's decision not to allow the restart of infected mink farms after culling (see ProMED-mail post 20200830.7730463). According to a 2010 decision, mink farming was to be banned in the Netherlands, starting 2024. The current paper has led the parliament and government to revise the decision, discontinuing mink farming to start in 2021 (see ProMED-mail post 20200830.7730463).
