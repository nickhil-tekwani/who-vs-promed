Haiti's cholera toll has passed 2500, official figures showed Sunday
[19 Dec 2010], dashing hopes the fatality rate might be beginning to
taper off. The health ministry listed 2535 deaths since the outbreak
in the impoverished Caribbean nation erupted in mid-October 2010.
Almost 57 000 of the 114 497 people infected have been treated in
hospital.

Hopes rose last week that the death rate could be slowing as fewer
than 30 people died on 2 consecutive days. Those hopes were dashed as
the earlier tolls were amended and 54 people were shown to have died
on 14 Dec 2010, the most recent day recorded. At the outbreak's peak
in November 2010 there were daily tolls of 60, 70 and even 80 and
above [deaths].

[The number of cases of cholera in Haiti's neighbor on the island of
Hispanola contines to slowly increase. Most of the cases are likely to
have been locally acquired but the much slower increase in cases
probably relates to better access to clean water. - Mod.LL]
