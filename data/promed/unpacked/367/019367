Days after the dreaded dengue announced its comeback in Ranchi, summer has brought in its wake another disease -- chickenpox. The highly contagious disease has already attacked hundreds and more are falling prey to it.

According to city hospitals, as many as 450 people have been affected by chickenpox in Ranchi in the past month alone. As many as 30 patients had been treated at the Rims in April [2014] while the Sadar hospital attended to 50 such patients in its OPD [outpatient departments] during the same period. The Devkamal hospital received 5 cases in the week gone by.

Chickenpox is essentially an airborne disease and highly contagious, with common symptoms such as low grade fever, running nose, and rashes.

According to statistics obtained from OPD authorities of the city hospitals, cases of chickenpox have been predominantly reported from areas such as Lalpur, Hatia, Dhurwa, Harmu, and Kanke. People from Kantatoli, Argora, Mandar, and Ratu have also fallen prey to the virus.

The city hospitals have already prepared for the patients. Dr Gopal Srivastava, in charge of the Sadar hospital, said the vaccines are already in place. "We have not yet received any admissions so far, but isolation wards are in place," Srivastava said.

However, experts have already listed measures to keep the virus at bay. "Chickenpox attacks bodies with low immunity and hence children fall prey to it," said Dr Anant Sinha of Devkamal hospital.
