Koi herpesvirus disease, Ireland
--------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 21 Jul 2016 from Dr Martin Blake, Chief Veterinary Officer, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Agriculture House, Dublin, Ireland

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 17 Jun 2016
Date of confirmation of the event: 12 Jul 2016
Date event resolved: 8 Jul 2016
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 2007
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Koi herpesvirus
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic and advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: County Dublin, Dublin
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 Jun 2016
Outbreak status: resolved 8 Jul 2016
Epidemiological unit: pond
Water type: fresh water
Population type: farmed
Production system: closed
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Koi carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) / 34 / 10 / 10 / 24 /0
Affected population: Most of the fish in this garden pond have been in-situ for approximately 3 years. In late April/ early May of this year [2016], 8 small fish were purchased from a pet shop in Co. Wicklow. These fish were quarantined for 3 weeks before being placed into the bigger pond. They appeared to be healthy throughout this time.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Koi carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) / 29.41 / 29.41 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: The pet shop was inspected and a sample of 20 fish encompassing different cohorts from each of their two koi suppliers was taken on 13 Jul 2016. Both companies who supply this shop are located outside the country but have Category I (disease free) status. PCR test results obtained from the National Reference Laboratory on July 15th indicated that all 20 fish were negative for KHV.

Control measures
Measures applied: disinfection/disinfestation; stamping out; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied; No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type /
The Marine Institute (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 7 Jul 2016 / Positive
Carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) / virus sequencing / 12 Jul 2016 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[The following information comes from the datasheet found on "Invasive species compendium" website available at http://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/78694:

"Koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD) is a disease of common carp, _Cyprinus carpio_, and its ornamental varieties that has had a significant effect on their culture since the mid- to late-1990s. The disease, as far as is known, only affects _C. carpio_, but the causative virus is highly infectious for that species and is easily transmitted to susceptible individuals or populations. The disease appears to have been spread to most continents with the transfer of ornamental carp, and in many countries has then been transmitted to common carp, both cultivated and feral. The causative virus is believed to be a herpesvirus, koi herpesvirus (KHV), by many research groups, but other groups believe that the evidence for the virus to be a herpesvirus is lacking, and have named the virus carp nephritis and gill necrosis virus (CNGV) after some of the main pathological features of the disease. The taxonomic status of the virus will be resolved by further research. The virus can be isolated in cell culture, but isolation from infected fish is not consistent. However, molecular diagnostic methods are more reliable. There is a need for more sensitive cell cultures, and for the different molecular diagnostic methods to be compared so that sensitive, standardized methods can be used for diagnosis. Vaccination protocols are being developed, and there is a need for further research in that area, particularly with regard to the safety of live virus vaccines, and the need to distinguish between vaccinated fish and fish naturally infected with the virus during health screening programs. More research is needed on the virus carrier state".
