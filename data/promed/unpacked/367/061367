Influenza activity is returning to low levels in most parts of the
WHO European Region
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------
- This issue is based on data reported in week 14/2011 [4-10 Apr
2011] by 47 [of the 53] Member States in the WHO European Region.
- Clinical consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or
acute respiratory infections (ARI) continue to decline or have
returned to baseline levels in 36 countries.
- Sentinel surveillance for hospitalized severe acute respiratory
infections (SARI) in 10 countries suggests that SARI hospitalizations
have passed previous peaks in all of these countries.
- 13 percent of sentinel specimens from patients with ILI or ARI, and
3 percent of specimens from sentinel SARI patients tested positive for
influenza.
- In week 14/2011 [4-10 Apr 2011], influenza B viruses represented
the majority of influenza detections from sentinel sites in the
Region.

Current situation -- week 14/2011 [4-10 Apr 2011]
-------------------------------------------------
Of the 37 countries reporting on the intensity of respiratory disease
activity, 34 reported low intensity and 3 reported medium intensity.
Of 38 countries reporting on the geographical spread of influenza, 28
reported none or sporadic activity. Local activity was reported in 5
countries, while 4 reported regional activity, and 1 (Croatia)
reported widespread activity. The impact of influenza on health care
systems was reported to be low in 19 and moderate in 2 of the 21
countries reporting on this indicator.

Trends in clinical and virological data indicate further declines in
influenza activity in the Region. Of the 15 countries indicating a
baseline threshold for influenza activity, all reported ILI or ARI
clinical consultation rates to be below these thresholds. Data from
sentinel hospital-based surveillance for SARI were reported by 10
countries: Albania, Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Romania,
the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Serbia, and Ukraine.
Sentinel SARI hospitalizations have declined to levels below previous
peaks in all of these countries. This has been accompanied by
concurrent declines in the percentage of sentinel SARI specimens
testing positive for influenza. Although a few countries (Armenia,
Kazakhstan, and Georgia) reported a slight increase in sentinel SARI
hospitalizations during the current week, the percentage of specimens
testing positive for influenza was very low (3 percent).

Virological situation -- week 14/2011 [4-10 Apr 2011]
-----------------------------------------------------
No country reported pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus to be
dominant but it was co-dominant with influenza B virus in 6 countries.
Influenza B virus was dominant in 4 countries.

Sentinel physicians collected 506 respiratory specimens, of which 64
(13 percent) were positive for influenza virus: 19 (30 percent) were
influenza A and 45 (70 percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A
viruses, 12 were subtyped: 9 (75 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 3 (25
percent) as A(H3). In the 8 countries testing 20 or more sentinel
specimens, influenza positivity ranged from 0 percent to 46 percent,
with a median of 11 percent (mean: 15 percent). In addition, 386
non-sentinel specimens were reported positive for influenza: 204 (53
percent) influenza A and 182 (47 percent) influenza B. Of the
influenza A viruses, 154 were subtyped: 123 (80 percent) as pandemic
A(H1) and 31 (20 percent) as A(H3).

Sentinel hospitals participating in SARI surveillance (10 countries)
collected 111 sentinel SARI specimens of which 3 (3 percent) were
positive for influenza (compared to 15 percent positive in week
13/2011 [28 Mar-3 Apr 2011]). Among the 3 countries testing 10 or more
sentinel SARI specimens, the percentage testing positive for influenza
ranged from 0 percent in Georgia and the Russian Federation to 4
percent in Kazakhstan.

Cumulative virological update -- weeks 40/2010-14/2011 [4 Oct 2010-10
Apr 2011]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 82 759 influenza virus detections were reported during
this period, of which 58 749 (71 percent) were influenza A and 24 010
(29 percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 46 843 were
subtyped: 45 115 (96 percent) as pandemic A(H1), 1727 (4 percent) as
influenza A(H3) and 1 as influenza A(H1).

>From week 40/2010 through week 14/2011 [4-10 Apr 2011], 1526 out of
5471 sentinel SARI specimens (28 percent) tested positive for
influenza. Of these influenza viruses, 867 (57 percent) were influenza
A and 659 (43 percent) influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 688
were subtyped: 636 (92 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 52 (8 percent)
as influenza A(H3).

Since week 40/2010, 4654 influenza viruses have been characterized
antigenically: 2387 were A(H1) pandemic A/California/7/2009
(H1N1)-like; 1936 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria/2/87
lineage); 155 were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like; 174 were
B/Florida/4/2006-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage); and 2 were
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). Based on the
genetic characterization of 566 influenza viruses, 150 belonged to the
pandemic A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1) clade; 10 belonged to the
pandemic A/Christchurch/16/2010 A(H1) clade; 46 belonged to the
pandemic A/Hong Kong/2213/2010 A(H1) clade; 132 belonged to the
recently emerged A/England/142/2010 subgroup characterized by S185T
substitution in the HA; 12 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by
A/Perth/16/2009; 6 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by
A/Victoria/208/2009; 28 belonged to the subgroup represented by A/Hong
Kong/2121/2010 in the A/Victoria/208/2009 A(H3) clade; 20 belonged to
the B/Bangladesh/3333/2007 clade (Yamagata lineage); and 162 to the
B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (Victoria lineage).

Since week 40/2010, 9 countries (Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK) have screened
3532 viruses for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors
oseltamivir and zanamivir. The UK analysed most of the viruses
screened (1672). Of the 3182 pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses that were
tested, 3090 were sensitive to both inhibitors and 92 viruses (2.9
percent) carried the NA H275Y mutation. These 92 viruses were
resistant to oseltamivir but remained sensitive to zanamivir. Four
influenza A(H3N2) viruses were tested and found to be sensitive to
both inhibitors. All of the 346 influenza B viruses tested for
susceptibility to oseltamivir and the 340 tested for susceptibility to
zanamivir were found to be sensitive. All 197 pandemic influenza
A(H1N1) 2009 viruses and 10 A(H3N2) viruses that were screened for
susceptibility to adamantanes were found to be resistant.

Comment
-------
Trends in clinical and virological data suggest that influenza
activity is declining further across the WHO European Region. Recent
declines in clinical indicators have been observed in nearly all
countries, and many are below baseline thresholds for influenza
activity. Influenza B now dominates in circulation relative to
pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009, but positivity rates continue to
decline for all influenza types and sub-types of influenza.

[The EuroFlu website features an interactive map presenting
qualitative indicators of influenza activity (intensity, trend,
geographical spread, and impact) and the dominant virus as assessed by
each of the countries. This information can be accessed by clicking on
the individual countries in the map and readers are recommended to
make use of this facility. In addition, clicking on France, the
Russian Federation, Turkey, and UK (England) will provide regional
data for these countries.

The data above indicate that influenza virus infection is now a minor
cause of serious respiratory infection and respiratory illness
throughout most of Europe. - Mod.CP]
