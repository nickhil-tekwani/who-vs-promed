Indonesian man allegedly dies of bird flu
-----------------------------------------
An Indonesian chicken butcher is alleged to have died of bird flu on Monday
[3 Nov 2008] after being treated in hospital for 2 days. Director of Hasan
Sadikin Hospital, Cissy Rachiana Prawira, said that the man had suffered
from breathing failure due to the pneumonia that had infected his lung. "We
have sent a blood test this morning but have yet to receive the result of
the test," she said.

Doctor Uun Sunardi said that the man had been declared as a suspect based
on a thorax photo indicating his acute pneumonia. "He has [potential] to
get infected by the disease [bird flu] as he works as a butcher," he said.
The man's father said that his son had suffered from fever since Thursday
[30 Oct 2008] and that he brought him to the Sartika Asih Hospital on
Sunday afternoon [2 Nov 2008]. "After taking a thorax picture, my son was
referred to the Hasan Sadikin Hospital [that] night," he said.

[ProMED-mail no longer reports unconfirmed human cases of avian (H5N1)
influenza, except with regard to reports emanating from Indonesia. This
exception is necessitated because the usual flow of information -- first
suspected and then confirmation -- has been disrupted as a consequence of
an official Indonesian embargo on immediate release of information.

The suspected case above is reported, therefore, although there is no
confirmation that the patient has died as a result of avian influenza virus
infection. According to the WHO Timeline
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/Timeline_08%2009%2023.pdf>
the most recent confirmed case (the 137th) in Indonesia occurred on 24 Jul
2008.

The location of the current suspected case is not stated in the report, but
the Sartika Asih and Hasan Sadikin Hospitals where the patient was treated
are located in Bandung, West Java, which can be located on the
