The Post-Courier reported recently that typhoid was becoming a common
killer in communities in the Highlands region. This was especially so
in the Western Highlands where the number of deaths and admissions to
the hospital had risen in recent years. More than 40 people have died
from typhoid in Western Highlands Province out of more than 600
patients reportedly admitted to Mount Hagen General Hospital last
year [1998.
According to a report from the hospital's acting chief executive
officer Dr James Kintua, the number of cases and deaths is
increasing. Dr Kintua said, apart from the deaths, typhoid patients
were rated to be number one in admission from other diseases. He said
since the epidemic started, it had become a common killer in the
communities. According to Dr Kintua the rise in the number of
reported cases is the result of people eating unhygienic food and
drinking contaminated water.
[In November 1998, Kavieng Hospital authorities reported an outbreak
of typhoid in Kavieng town [in New Ireland Province with reported
cases reaching a toll of more than 30 people. New Ireland provincial
disease controller Peter Bale said the outbreak began two months ago
and the number of people affected has drastically increased in the
past two weeks. He added that a number of children treated at the
hospital had been experiencing diarrhoea and constant fever while
adults have been suffering from constipation and dehydration. The
hospital has reported one death so far from typhoid last week.
Mr Bale said health inspectors were conducting research on the
outbreak, by checking all fast food outlets in Kavieng, the town
water supply system and settlements, to see if there was proper
sanitation and living conditions.
[According to the 5 Jan 1999 news report, health authorities in
Kavieng have reported a decline in the number of patients treated for
typhoid at the hospital over the last four weeks. Provincial health
adviser, Dr Joachim Taulo said precautions had been taken when the
disease broke out in the Kavieng township last month which had
prevented town residents from contracting and spreading the disease.
Dr Taulo said a special committee was set up comprising health and
the Kavieng Town Authority to monitor and control the spread of the
disease which had resulted in it declining. He said the authority had
put a stop to the selling of cooked food at the market and streets.
[Presumably that was the common source of infection - Mod.CYC
Health inspectors also carried out tests on the town water supply
while all fast food outlets were warned to apply precautionary
measures when preparing food. [They did not have to observe the
no-selling rule - Mod.CYC
Dr Taulo also warned residents to be extra careful when handling food
and use clean water. He said people should report immediately for
treatment at the hospital when they begin to feel sick and not wait
until they are very ill.
