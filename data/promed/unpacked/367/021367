Four residents of a village in Kazakhstan's southern region of Zhambyl have been diagnosed with anthrax. The region's health authorities said on [Tue 17 Sep 2019] that 44 individuals who have been in close contact with the 4 have been placed under medical supervision as well. According to the authorities, the 4 patients are believed to have been infected with anthrax by consuming meat from a cow slaughtered several days ago.

Less than a month earlier, a village near the Kazakh capital, Nur-Sultan, was put under quarantine after lab tests confirmed anthrax infections in several people there. Kazakhstan's Health Ministry said on [19 Aug 2019] that 5 residents of the village of Olginka, 100 km [approx 62 mi] east of Nur-Sultan, had been hospitalized with anthrax symptoms, 4 of whom tested positive for _Bacillus anthracis_ -- the bacteria that causes the infectious disease.

In 2016 in nearby Qaraghandy region, 2 people died as a result of anthrax infections.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), domestic and wild animals -- such as cattle, sheep, goats, antelope, and deer -- can become infected by inhaling or ingesting spores in contaminated soil, plants, or water. The CDC says all types of anthrax infections can cause death if they are not treated with antibiotics.

[I included the third report as it demonstrates where our US tax dollars go. This latter report indicated possible gastroenteric infections, while the 2 previous local reports had typical cutaneous lesions on the hands and forearms. If the four men had been slaughtering and butchering sick cattle as is hinted, such cutaneous lesions are very typical. The search for any affected source cattle appears to have been perfunctory.

Zhambyl is in the midst of an area of Kazakhstan where livestock anthrax occurs. For a description of Zhambyl, go to: http://spktaraz.kz/eng/jambul/ and: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambyl_Region. To confirm we are in the right part of Kazakhstan on the southern border with Kyrgyzstan, go to Zhualy, the paired district: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhualy_District. - Mod.MHJ
