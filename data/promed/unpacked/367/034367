Santa Cruz is the department [state or province equivalent] with the
most rabies cases in the entire country, but 2 people have died die
from this disease in Cochabamba. According to data from the Ministry
of Health, 49 of the 121 rabies cases reported this year [2011] in
Bolivia occurred in Santa Cruz. In all of 2010, the incidence in the
region was 28 cases. After Santa Cruz, the departments with the most
cases are Cochabamba with 40, followed by Sucre with 21, La Paz and
Beni with 4, Potosi with 2, and Tarija with one.

Precisely due to this situation, the health authorities have fixed as
a goal the vaccination of 90 per cent of the dogs and cats in the
city, thus exceeding the numbers of previous campaigns, when 80 per
cent of the animals were immunized. The alarming expansion of the
disease forced the health authorities to program a rigorous
vaccination campaign for this weekend [13-14 Aug 2011].

The official responsible for the rabies program of the departmental
Health Services (SEDES), Johnny Ruiz, stated that this effort will be
undertaken in the 12 urban districts of the Santa Cruz capital, given
that the animals in the cantons (Paurito, Montero Hoyos, and Palmar
del Oratorio) have already been immunized in [vaccination]
mobilizations in previous weeks. Some 550 000 doses of vaccine will be
available and have been distributed to the health centers. Other
cities in the country expect to begin their vaccination campaigns this
Sunday [14 Aug 2011], the national [health] authorities stated.

"We are in an alert situation and because of this we all must
cooperate to halt the disease," said the SEDES director, Juaquin
Monasterio, and indicated that during the course of this week the
[vaccination] brigades will circulate in the neighborhoods to urge
people to participate in the vaccinations. "All the logistics are now
ready," said Ruiz, indicating that they plan to mobilize 1121 brigades
composed of government employees, municipal police, Uagrm [Universidad
Autonoma Gabriel Rene Moreno], and Udabol [Universidad de Aquino de
Bolivia] students and armed forces soldiers, who will be located in
the health centers and public places in the neighborhoods.

Speaking for his agency, the head of Zoonoses of the Ministry of
Health, Gary Barrios, recommended that the population vaccinate dogs
over one month of age. In order to dispel doubts, Ruiz stated that
pets that have been vaccinated within the past 6 months must be
vaccinated again, given that the more doses given the better the
immune response against the virus.

According to Barrios, the Ministry of Health has distributed 800 000
[doses] of the biologics [vaccine] against the disease in the whole
country. This amount, he added, is over and above the 1.5 million
doses of the vaccine that were previously distributed.

[The rabies outbreak continues intensifying in Santa Cruz department.
Involvement of the community, as indicated above, is critical to the
success of the vaccination campaign. One hopes that 90 per cent
vaccination coverage will be achieved.
