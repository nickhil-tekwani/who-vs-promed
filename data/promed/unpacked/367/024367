----------------------------------------------------------------
For over 50 years, deaths due to varicella in the United States have exceeded deaths from measles, mumps, and rubella. The introduction of varicella vaccine during 1995-1996 was followed by a marked decline in mortality rates. [1,2]

[ProMED thanks Steve Berger for submitting these informative references on decrease in mortality following implementation of varicella vaccine.

Also see FE Andre et al. 2008. Vaccination greatly reduces disease, disability, death and inequity worldwide. Bulletin of the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/2/07-040089/en/ doi: 10.2471/BLT.07.040089). This bulletin provides an excellent summary of the benefits of vaccines. While elimination of smallpox may be the best example of a successful vaccine, data for efficacy of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine are given below. These vaccine-preventable diseases still occur, largely because of vaccine hesitancy, but disease severity and mortality are greatly reduced.

Before the measles vaccination program started in 1963, an estimated 3- 4 million people got measles each year in the United States. Of these, approximately 500 000 cases were reported each year to CDC; and of these, 400-500 died, 48 000 were hospitalized, and 1000 developed encephalitis (brain swelling) from measles. Since then, widespread use of measles vaccine has led to a greater than 99 percent reduction in measles cases compared with the pre-vaccine era. However, measles is still common in other countries. Unvaccinated people continue to get measles while abroad and bring the disease into the United States and spread it to others (excerpted and edited from https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccination.html).

Before the US mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States. Since the 2-dose vaccination program was introduced in 1989, mumps cases have ranged year to year from a couple of hundred to several thousand. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases, from 229 cases in 2012 to 6366 cases in 2016. The recent increase has been mainly due to multiple mumps outbreaks reported across the country in settings where people often have close contact with one another, like college campuses (excerpted and edited from https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html).

Before the rubella vaccination program started in 1969, rubella was a common and widespread infection in the United States. During the last major rubella epidemic in the United States from 1964-1965, an estimated 12.5 million people got rubella, 11 000 pregnant women lost their babies, 2100 newborns died, and 20 000 babies were born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Once the vaccine became widely used, the number of people infected with rubella in the United States dropped dramatically. Today, [fewer] than 10 people in the United States are reported as having rubella each year. Since 2012, all rubella cases had evidence that they were infected when they were living or traveling outside the United States (excerpted and edited from https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/about/in-the-us.html).
