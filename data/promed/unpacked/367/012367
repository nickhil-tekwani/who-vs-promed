Jamaica's Ministry of Agriculture announced that huanglongbing was
detected in plantations in the area of St. Catherine. The ministry
warned that if not treated early and decisively, this plague could put
at risk the entire citrus production in the country, whose revenues
are estimated at JMD 3.7 billion [approx. USD 43 million].

Evidence of the disease was found last September [2009], when samples
were collected and analyzed at the University of the West Indies,
after which it was determined that the plague is present in the
country. Other Caribbean states, most recently the Dominican Republic,
are affected by the disease, which has caused tremendous damage to
plantations in the USA, Latin America and Asia.

In its statement, the ministry warns that, to date, no country that
has reported the infection has been able to eradicate it, which
implies the need for a concerted effort by the authorities and
plantation owners.

The citrus greening disease which was detected in Bog Walk, St.
Catherine earlier this week has now spread to Clarendon. According to
the Jamaica Citrus Protection Agency, at least one plant sample in the
parish has tested positive.

Programme Manager at the agency Alfred Barrett said surveillance teams
from the Ministry are now in other parishes to conduct checks. He said
the disease could also spread to other plants.

Mr. Barrett is urging citrus farmers to take advantage of training
opportunities in their area on how to deal with the disease. He said
the Agriculture Ministry is still trying to determine the origin of
the citrus greening disease, which is spread by the citrus psyllid
insect.

[Huanglongbing (HLB, also called citrus greening), is one of the most
damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruits. In
northern and central America and the Caribbean area, it is caused by
the fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacterium _Candidatus_ Liberibacter
asiaticus. However, the species may comprise several different
variants, even within a given region. Symptoms include blotchy
mottling and yellowing of leaves and small, irregularly shaped, pale
fruits with bad taste which are unmarketable. Affected trees become
stunted and may die prematurely.

_Ca._ L. asiaticus is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina
citri_), and infectious insects can be carried long distances by
various means. The disease is also often spread by grafting and
possibly seed transmission. The vector is specific to _Citrus_ and
close relatives, and thus the disease is confined to these crops.
Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of
clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, and vector
control in orchards and non-crop reservoirs (such as ornamental
mock-orange _Philadelphus_). Biological control by interplanting of
guava is showing some promise (see ProMED-mail post 20070912.3018).

Two other species, _Ca._ L. africanus (including a subsp. capensis)
and _Ca._ L. americanus, and their specific vectors exist in the
respective areas. _Ca._ L. americanus is closely related to _Ca._ L.
asiaticus but has been reported mainly from Brazil. HLB has not been
reported from the Mediterranean region or Australia.
