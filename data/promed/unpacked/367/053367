[According to the last 6-monthly report (July to December 2012) sent to the OIE by South Korea, classical swine fever (CSF) had been absent in the country since April 2009. A reason for the prompt notification is due to South Korea's ongoing surveillance (both general and targeted) in domestic and wild animals [http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalsituation; to see the information from Korea (Rep. of), you need to choose the region and scroll to the country name and time period].

The following information was obtained from the summary of a study in a publication titled "Prevalence of Classical Swine Fever Virus in Domestic Pigs in South Korea: 1999-2011" (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22925439). According to this article,
"The major policy for eradication of classical swine fever (CSF) in South Korea has focused on the implementation of compulsory vaccination of the susceptible pig population. A vaccine strain of CSF virus, the LOM strain, is used to maintain high herd sero-conversion, a practice complementary to the 'stamping-out policy' and restriction of animal movement during disease outbreaks. The highest number of outbreaks in South Korea occurred in 2002 and 2003; since then, outbreaks have decreased each year, with the last CSF outbreak recorded in 2009."

The last 2 outbreaks reported by South Korea in 2009 were located in the region of Chungcheonbuk-do and Gyeongsangnam-do. Details of these outbreaks can be found at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail.
