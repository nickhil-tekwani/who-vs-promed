[Dr. Nobuhiko Okabe, Director of Infectious Disease Surveillance Center,
wrote the following: " We would like to send the following information
relating to the serological investigation of humans involved in the mass
culling operation at a large-scale poultry farm affected with highly
pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H5N1) in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan. These
studies were commissioned by the Kyoto Prefectural Government from the
Infectious Disease Surveillance Center and the Department of Virology III
(Influenza CC of WHO), National Institute of Infectious Diseases. Both
Departments (IDSC and Virology III) submitted a report officially on the
studies requested, to the Kyoto Prefecture on Wed 22 Dec 2004.
Among 58 subjects involved in the mass culling operation, 4 positives by
single sera and one positive by paired samples were detected by micro NT
test. All 33 controls were negative. One person [who] seroconverted claimed
sore throat soon after starting chemoprophylactic treatment with
oseltamivir but without any systemic symptoms such as fever. The other 4
seropositive persons did not experience any influenza-like symptoms
including fever. All seropositive poultry workers had history of exposure
to ill chickens without protections. One seropositive prefecture worker is
among the 3 sent as the 1st investigation team.
This study highlighted the potential risk of HPAI infection among persons
who were involved in the mass culling operation without personal infection
prevention procedures including wearing PPE [personal protective equipment]
and oseltamivir chemoprophylaxis and the importance of these procedures. In
case of HPAI outbreak in other poultry farm in the future, the personal
infection prevention procedures should be emphasized and further study
would be considered for more precise assessment of the risk of infection
and effectiveness of the personal infection prevention procedures.
The following is the content of the report translated into English and
which we have sent just now sent to WHO both HQ and WPRO."

Serological investigation among humans involved in the mass culling
operation at a large-scale poultry farm affected with highly pathogenic
avian influenza H5N1 in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Background
----------------
58 persons who were involved in the operation during the poultry highly
pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreak in Feb 2004 were
investigated. Of which 16 are poultry workers from the affected farm and
the other 42 are prefecture workers who participated in the poultry culling
operation. All participants were asked about the type of work that they did
with poultry, performance of personal infection prevention procedures, and
illnesses experienced during and after the operation. For comparison, serum
specimens were also collected from 33 prefecture workers who did not join
the operation.
The poultry workers had been exposed to ill chickens without protection
before prefectural intervention. The first investigation team consisting of
3 persons sent urgently by the Prefecture wore gowns, goggles, gloves and
masks (non N-95) without prophylactic use of oseltamivir. Then Kyoto
Prefecture government conducted the mass culling operation from 27 Feb to
22 Mar 2004. All persons involved in the operation including the poultry
workers and the 3 first investigation team members wore personal protective
equipments (PPE) including N-95 mask and were given oseltamivir
chemoprophylaxis during the operation.
2. Results
----------
Serum specimens were tested by a microneutralization assay by use of an
avian influenza virus A/Chicken/Kyoto/3/2004(H5N1) which had been isolated
from a chicken from the affected farm. The assay was performed at
Department of Virology III, National Institute of Infectious Disease,
Tokyo, Japan. Serum specimens were considered to be positive for antibody
to H5 viruses by microneutralization assay if titres of 10 were obtained,
because all the control sera showed titres of less than 10 and a cut-off
value could not be assigned statistically. All specimens were collected
approximately one month after the end of operation. Frozen serum specimens
which had been taken from the 4 persons about one month earlier were
obtained, therefore we could evaluate their neutralization antibody
seroconversions.
Category / No. of persons enrolled / Positive serum Anti-H5 neutralization
antibodies / Negative serum Anti-H5 neutralization antibodies /
Poultry workers / 16 / 12 / 4* /
Prefectural workers / 42 / 41 / 1 /
Control / 33 / 33 / 0 /
* One of whom seroconverted.
Among 4 persons with paired serum samples, one person seroconverted. This
person claimed sore throat soon after starting chemoprophylactic treatment
with oseltamivir for a couple of days but without any systemic symptoms
such as fever. The other four seropositive persons did not experience any
influenza-like symptoms including fever. All seropositive poultry workers
had histories of unprotected exposure to ill chickens. One seropositive
prefecture worker eas among the three sent as the first investigation team.
3. Discussion
--------------
The seroconverted poultry worker was considered to have been infected with
H5 influenza virus recently. Therefore, he was likely to have been infected
during unprotected contacts with the affected chickens. The other 3
seropositive poultry workers were possibly infected with H5 influenza virus
also during unprotected contacts. The seropositive prefecture worker may
have been infected during the first investigation visit with incomplete PPE
such as without wearing N-95 mask.
It is difficult to evaluate precisely the effectiveness of personal
infection preventive procedures including wearing PPE and chemoprophylaxis
based on this study because paired serum specimens were tested in only 4
persons. However, since all prefecture workers who participated in the
operation with the personal infection prevention procedures were
seronegative except a seropositive person of the first investigation team,
the personal infection prevention procedures were considered to be effective.
Among these 5 seropositive persons, none clinically developed human HPAI
infection compatible symptoms or other febrile illness. They also took
chemoprophylaxis during the period of the operation organized by Kyoto
prefecture. Therefore, the chemoprophylaxis may have prevented them from
developing illness. There are no public health problems in terms of
possibility of their developing illness related to this event and further
HPAI transmission.
There are some limitations of this study to deliver solid conclusions.
First, the validity of the cut-off value at 10 in our assay has not been
not evaluated sufficiently, because of limited knowledge on human H5
infections. Second, paired serum specimens were obtained from only a
limited number of people.
