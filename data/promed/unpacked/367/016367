[1] Israel - asymptomatic carriers

The Health Ministry is preparing for a campaign to inoculate children in the south of Israel with a live attenuated vaccine against polio, in light of the continued spread of the disease through the region's sewage systems. However, a final decision will only be made this weekend and announced on Sunday [4 Aug 2013].

The new inoculations would be on top of the regular polio shots given to all children at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months and 12 months, and then again in 2nd grade. Those shots contain the dead polio virus.

As Haaretz reported 3 weeks ago, any decision to revaccinate children with a live-virus vaccine involves an ethical dilemma, since the goal isn't to protect the children themselves, as they are already protected by the dead-virus vaccine. Rather, the goal would be to protect those around them, and especially their parents and other relatives. The live attenuated virus will commonly spread to other people, and thus inoculate them as well.

Revaccination involves virtually no risk that the children themselves will contract polio, with only one known case of a child who contracted polio from a live-virus vaccine after previously being inoculated with the dead-virus version.

Until 2005, Israel regularly vaccinated children with the live attenuated virus, which is administered orally. But in exceptional cases, the live attenuated virus can cause polio in other people who contract it from the inoculated child, especially if they already have weakened immune systems, for instance because they are seriously ill.

This is why the Health Ministry ultimately stopped the practice, and one reason why it is still weighing the benefits of a new inoculation campaign.

To reduce the potential risks, the ministry has ordered drops containing only 2 strains of attenuated polio virus, rather than the 3 contained in the drops used until 2005.

The ministry said it is currently consulting with leading experts in the field, including senior pediatricians and family doctors, as well as public figures and officials from the affected municipalities, on whether to launch the campaign.

Meanwhile, it is continuing to collect stool samples from residents of the south in order to assess the spread of the disease. Thus far, it has collected 2300 samples, from which it has identified 7 Israelis who definitely carry the virus and 10 suspected carriers. However, none of them have come down with active polio.

Israel hasn't had an active polio case since 1988, when 15 people came down with the disease, mostly in Hadera and Or Akiva. All suffered some degree of paralysis.

The current polio outbreak began in late May [2013]. The virus was 1st detected in the sewers of the Bedouin town of Rahat in the Negev. It later spread to the sewage systems of several other southern towns, including Be'er Sheva and Ashdod.

Over the past month [July 2013], it has also spread to several towns in central Israel, including Ramle, Lod and Modi'in. The Health Ministry thinks the disease arrived from Egypt.

The ministry believes that the fact no active polio cases have yet occurred despite the spread of the disease is because such a high percentage of the population has been vaccinated against polio, an estimated 94 to 95 percent.

Worldwide, only 5 countries are known to have people with active polio. In 3 of them, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria, the disease is considered endemic, while in the other 2, Somalia and Kenya, only a few isolated cases have been identified since the start of 2013. Should anyone here come down with an active case of the disease, Israel would join this dubious list.

[The dilemma posed by the re-introduction of the live attenuated vaccine is a significant issue, as the possibility of having vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV) cases among inadequately vaccinated individuals is of real concern. As seen in other countries, there is also the risk of having circulating VDPV (cVDPV) cases, especially when the vaccine is used in areas with pockets of low vaccination coverages. It is interesting that, thus far, the wild poliovirus carriage rate is 0.3-0.4 percent (7-10 out of 2300 sampled), a very low rate, suggesting there is a significant "wall of immunes" preventing heightened circulation of the WPV in the community.

In the absence of paralytic cases, in an area with relatively high vaccination coverages, one can understand the challenges the MOH is having in deciding the best approach to take to interrupt transmission of the WPV.

Israel is comprised of 6 main administrative districts: Jerusalem District, Northern District, Haifa District, Central District, Tel Aviv District, and the Southern District. WPV1 isolates have been found in environmental samples of sewage in both the Southern and Central Districts earlier this year [2013] (see prior ProMED-mail posts: Poliomyelitis update (14): Israel, environmental samples, global 20130715.1826123; Poliomyelitis update (10): Israel, positive environmental samples, MOH 20130605.1756289; Poliomyelitis update (09): Israel, positive environmental samples, RFI 20130604.1754766; and Poliomyelitis update (08): Israel, environmental isolates, WHO, RFI 20130603.1753099 for more details on these isolates from sewage sampling). These isolates were found to be genetically similar to those circulating in Pakistan and the sewage isolate found in Egypt in December 2012 (see prior ProMED-mail post Poliomyelitis - worldwide (01): Egypt ex Pakistan, Niger 20130122.1509210).

According to a Channel 1 News report, 3 children from the Bedouin community of Tel Sheva and a 4th southern district child are feared to have contracted polio.

Health Ministry officials have been urging parents to have all children under 6 vaccinated after traces of polio were detected in Beersheva area sewers. In addition, traces of the virus were found recently in the Sharon Region sewage system. The system is connected to the Lev HaSharon, Kalansua, Jaljulia, Kfar Bara and Choreshim communities.

Health officials in the southern district in the past 2 weeks conducted tests on 1700 stool samples from adults and children from areas in which polio was detected in the sewage system. Additional testing is being conducted for those people whose stool samples tested positive. Health officials explain the children may be carrying the illness but remain asymptomatic.

Thousands of samples are being studied as well to determine how many children up the age of 8 carry the virus.

If these cases are confirmed, and if it is established that a large population carries the virus, the ministry is likely to give an additional vaccine to an estimated 150 000 children under the age of 8. A decision is expected within approximately 2 weeks.

[This moderator has attempted to find more information on these supposedly suspected cases of polio in the Southern district to no avail. From the wording of the article, this moderator suspects that the "alleged" cases refer to asymptomatic carriers of the WPV; the article mentions 3 or possibly 4 such cases out of 1700 stool samples tested for WPV, whereas the newswire in the 1st section ([1]) mentions 7-10 positive samples out of 2300 stool specimens processed. The article is being presented here requesting clarification from knowledgeable sources in Israel. - Mod.MPP]

Somalia's Ministry of Health confirms there are now 94 cases of polio in south-central Somalia, and the outbreak is showing no signs of slowing down. New cases of the disease near the border with Ethiopia have also put that country at risk.

The polio outbreak, 1st identified in May [2013], is spreading throughout Somalia, according to Dr. Yassin Nur, head of immunization at Somalia's Ministry of Health.

He said another case also has been confirmed in the autonomous region of Somaliland, close to Ethiopia, and could easily be transmitted across the border.

"The risk is there," Nur said. "Not to mention that Ethiopia has a very long and porous border with Somalia, and it would be very easy to have an outbreak in Ethiopia."

Another 10 cases of polio also have been confirmed across the border with Kenya, in the Dadaab refugee camps.

Before the new outbreak, polio had been nearly eradicated across the world, with active cases reported only in 3 countries: Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria.

But the U.N. children's agency UNICEF said that in May [2013], a 2-year-old girl in Somalia was confirmed to have contracted polio, becoming the 1st case in the country since 2007.

According to Nur, the population of internally displaced people [IDPs], who number more than one million in Somalia, are most at risk of contracting the virus that causes polio. The constant movement of people raises the risk of spreading the disease.

"The problem is this movement between Somalia and Kenya, between Somalia and Ethiopia," Nur said. "Whether they are IDPs or not, the movement of the people is what worries us."

Nur is hopeful a vaccination campaign launched in coordination with U.N. agencies, as well as local and international organizations, will be able to "limit and control" the transmission of the disease.

According to the U.N., almost 4 million people have received a polio vaccination in Somalia since May [2013].

Children are most at risk of contracting the disease, which has no cure and can paralyze those who are infected.

[According to the most recent global update on the Polio Eradication Initiative website, as of today [31 Jul 2013], there have been 95 cases of WPV in Somalia and 10 in Kenya in this ongoing outbreak. The challenges of interrupting transmission in a "floating" population as seen in Somalia and Kenya are expressed in the above newswire, as the denominator of numbers of individuals targeted for vaccination changes on a daily basis with the continued migration of the internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Somalia, and those who seek refuge in the camps in Kenya. The concerns of possible spread into Ethiopia are valid concerns, especially with the most recent case occurring in Somaliland, near the border with Ethiopia, where there is a similar population movement ongoing.

[4] India - 4th case of VDPV
Date: 30 Jul 2013
Source: The Hindu [edited]
http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mumbai-child-becomes-fourth-indian-to-get-polio-from-vaccine/article4967388.ece?homepage=true


A 9-month-old boy from Navi Mumbai has tested positive for vaccine- derived poliovirus (VDPV) type 2 and is now on a ventilator at BJ Wadia Hospital in Parel. This is the 4th such case recorded in the country this year [2013].

"When he arrived, he didn't have any power in all the 4 limbs. Now, he is showing signs of improvement. There is flickering and muscle contraction in his legs," said the director of the Directorate of Health Services, Dr. Satish Pawar.

[The boy], born in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, was brought to Mumbai by his mother when he was 2 months old. Since then, he has been orally vaccinated for polio 5 times. "There seems to be a problem with his immunity, which we are examining at the moment. In normal children, the polio virus in the intestines completely dies after about 200-300 rounds of replication. But in this child's case, due to low immunity, the virus seems to have become virulent, resulting in polio," said Dr. Pawar.

A Polio Surveillance Team visited the Ilthanpada area in Navi Mumbai where the child lives. The area has 95 per cent polio vaccination coverage, according to municipal records. The team has taken stool samples of all the family members, including [the boy's] older brother.

Meanwhile, the State Health Department has asked the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation to follow a protocol. "There are about 450 children in the Ilthanpada area, and they will be thoroughly examined. A polio drive will be undertaken in Navi Mumbai, and if there are homes that had not administered polio drops, they will be asked to do so," Dr. Pawar said. The sewage system and other sanitary conditions in the area would also be checked.

The earlier 3 cases were from Orissa, Pudicherry and Maharashtra. In 2012, a VDPV case was recorded from West Bengal. Going by the past records, circulating VDPVs have been rapidly stopped with 2-3 rounds of high-quality immunisation campaigns. Health experts said the solution lay in immunising a child several times with the oral vaccine to stop polio transmission, regardless of the origin of the virus.

"The time has come to shift to injected polio vaccine, as this does not cause the disease. Even as India has become polio-free, the need of the hour is for the government to come up with a comprehensive programme where even VDPVs don't occur," said Dr. Nitin Shah, paediatrician from PD Hinduja Hospital.

[The concerns re: VDPV infection in an immune compromised individual is that there is the chance the individual will become a chronic VDPV carrier and virus shedder over prolonged periods of time.

It is interesting that the discussion on switching to the inactivated vaccine has begun, especially given the occurrence of 4 VDPV cases this year (2013). It has been 2.5 years since the last case of WPV associated polio was identified in India (in January 2011). The cost and logistical implications of switching from an oral vaccine to an injectable vaccine in India are not minor. We await further discussions.

Data in WHO as of 31 Jul 2012 for 2012 data and 30 Jul 2013 for 2013 data.

Highlights of this week:

- In Nigeria, the Presidential Task Force has reviewed the latest epidemiology of poliovirus transmission and strategies to overcome remaining challenges. A new risk-classification system of low-performing areas aims to focus resources where they are most needed.

- In Pakistan, the outbreak in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) is continuing, with a new case reported from Khyber Agency. The current outbreak is threatening progress achieved elsewhere in the country, as well as efforts in neighbouring Afghanistan.

Afghanistan
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 remains 3. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [6 Jun 2013] (WPV1 from Nangarhar).
- All 3 WPV cases this year were reported from Eastern Region. In the high-risk Southern Region, no WPV cases have been reported since November 2012.
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [13 Mar 2013] (from Kandahar, Southern Region).
- Subnational immunization days (SNIDs) were held on [1-3 Jul 2013], with resources focusing on Southern and Eastern Region. Planning is underway for nationwide activities in August [2013].

Nigeria
- Five new WPV cases were reported in the past week (4 WPV1s from Kano state and one WPV1 from Yobe state), bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2013 to 40. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [9 Jul 2013] (WPV1 from Kano).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains one (with onset of paralysis on [6 Jun 2013] from Borno). Although this cVDPV2 case is linked to cVDPV2 currently circulating in Chad, which has also been detected in Cameroon, cVDPV2 linked to this transmission chain had previously been isolated from an environmental sample in Kano in March [2013] (indicating circulation in Nigeria).
- The latest epidemiology and strategies were discussed at last week's Presidential Task Force meeting on [23 Jul 2013] in Abuja. The meeting underscored that more than half of this year's [2013] cases are from 2 states: Borno and Yobe.
- Performance during Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) continues to improve in all high-risk states. However, vaccination coverage gaps persist in low-performing Local Government Areas (LGAs), particularly in Kano, Borno and Yobe.
- Although Borno and Yobe are affected by insecurity, polio eradication activities are continuing in most LGAs of Borno and all LGAs of Yobe. Special strategies are being evaluated for these areas, including conducting
"wall fencing" immunizations around insecure areas, use of permanent health teams and increased use of Short Interval Additional Dose (SIADs) campaigns, as and when opportunities arise. Social mobilization activities are being targeted to increase community demand for polio vaccination.
- Efforts must continue to improve micro planning, reaching "absent" children and further engaging communities and traditional leaders to address non-compliance.
- At the same time, more needs to be done to foster subnational political engagement [as] the involvement of LGA Chairpersons remains inconsistent across high-risk states. Engagement at the state-level is also inconsistent, as measured by the Abuja Commitments.
- A new risk classification system will improve the delivery of resources to areas where they are most needed. Across the high-risk states, 129 LGAs have now been classified as "very, very high risk," "very high risk," or "special situation" (security-affected LGAs in Borno and Yobe).
- The next subnational IPD in northern states is planned for early September [2013] using bivalent OPV. Measles vaccine will also be offered during this round.

Pakistan
- One new WPV1 case was reported in the past week (WPV1 from Khyber Agency, Federally Administered Tribal Area - FATA), bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2013 to 22. It is the most recent WPV1 case in the country and had onset of paralysis on [3 Jul 2013].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 5. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [8 May 2013] (from Gadap town, greater Karachi, Sindh).
- Additionally, one new WPV1 environmental sample was isolated from Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), collected in early July [2013]. In total, 22 environmental samples have tested positive for WPV1 in 2013 from various sites across Pakistan, the bulk from Peshawar (9) and Hyderabad, Sindh (5).
- Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) is the major WPV1 reservoir in Pakistan at the moment, accounting for 13 of this year's [2013] 22 cases in the country. Khyber Agency is particularly affected, with 9 cases, and in particular Bara tehsil of Khyber. This outbreak is threatening progress achieved elsewhere in the country and in neighbouring Afghanistan. In 2011 and 2012, Bara was the epicentre of a major outbreak which also spread to other areas.

Chad, Cameroon and Central African Republic
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac). No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4 (the most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 May 2013] from Ennedi).
- The 4 cVDPV2 cases were reported from various parts of the country, indicating widespread transmission. In some areas, only one immunization round has been conducted in response. A more comprehensive outbreak response to these cVDPV2 cases must be planned and implemented. The risk of further spread within Chad and further international spread remains high (cVDPV2 circulating in Chad has also been detected in Cameroon and Nigeria).
- In Cameroon, no new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 2. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [27 May 2013] (from Extreme-Nord).
- Emergency outbreak response is ongoing in both countries.
- Central African Republic (CAR) continues to be at risk of re-infection due to proximity with Chad and, in some areas, insecurity. To minimize the risk and consequences of potential re-infection, 2 subnational immunization campaigns were conducted in border areas with Chad, in June and July [2013] using trivalent OPV.

Horn of Africa
- 24 new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week (23 from Somalia and one from Kenya), bringing the total number of WPV1 cases in the region to 105 (95 from Somalia and 10 from Kenya). The most recent case in the region had onset of paralysis on [10 Jul 2013] (from Somalia).
- Eleven of the newly-reported cases are from Banadir, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak, accounting for more than half of all cases associated with this outbreak.
- Four of the newly-reported cases are from Lower Shabelle, areas of which are inaccessible due to insecurity. Special strategies continue to be implemented for these areas, including increased local-level access negotiations, immunizing older age groups and setting up vaccination posts at entry/exit points of inaccessible areas.
- In Somalia, nationwide campaigns were conducted last week, targeting children under the age of 5 years. In Kenya, SIAs are currently ongoing ([27-30 Jul 2013]), aiming to reach host communities around the Dadaab camps.
- Immunization campaigns across the Horn of Africa, including in Ethiopia and Yemen, will continue throughout August [2013].

West Africa
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was a WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- Multi-country immunization campaigns are planned in West Africa for mid-October [2013], as well as SNIDs in parts of Mali and Niger in July and September [2013], respectively.

[Since the last polio update, with information as of 10 Jul 2013, there have been 38 new cases reported, raising the global total of polio cases from 132 to 170. 32 of these cases have occurred in the ongoing outbreak in Somalia and Kenya, raising the total number of outbreak associated cases to 105 from 73. In Somalia, during this 3-week period (from 10-31 Jul 2013), there have been 30 newly identified cases, raising the total number of cases in Somalia to 95.

A disappointing observation is that the year-to-date total of confirmed cases of WPV associated polio for 2013 is now 170, whereas the year-to-date total for this same period in 2012 was 103.
