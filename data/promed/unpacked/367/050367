The agriculture ministry of Kyrgyzstan reported Wednesday [9 Jan

[During 2007, Kyrgyzstan submitted to the OIE (World Organization for
Animal Health) reports on outbreaks of FMD serotypes O and A. No
report for 2007 on the applied disease control measures is available;
Kyrgyzstan's 2006 report mentioned vaccination against FMD.
Confirmation of the current media report, and the essential
epidemiological data such as exact location, vaccination status of
the affected cattle, and their age and number, and particularly the
serotypes involved, are requested.
