Dr. Chen Jianping, a researcher with the Zhejiang Academy of
Agricultural Sciences, has discovered a new type of wheat virus. The
virus has been confirmed by scientists outside China and has been
named China wheat mosaic virus. It was found by Dr. Jianping while
he was investigating wheat diseases in China's wheat-growing regions
in 1996. Wheat experts in Beijing have said that viruses, including
the one newly discovered, have caused serious damage to wheat crops
in several areas.
