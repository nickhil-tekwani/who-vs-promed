The seasonal flu death rate is higher than swine flu's, the director
of the Iranian Society of Internists said in Tehran on Saturday [5 Sep
2009]. Compared with H1N1 flu [i.e. pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus
infection], regular [seasonal] influenza kills more Iranians, but
there are no official figures showing the exact death rate from
regular flu across the country, Iraj Khosrow-Nia told the Mehr News
Agency. Khosrow-Nia said the old and those who have had chronic
diseases are those [most seriously affected] by regular seasonal flu.

Great numbers of people die of regular flu per annum in the country
during the fall and winter, but the rate has not been registered so
far, Khosrow-Nia explained.

As of 22 Jun 2009, when it burst onto the scene in the Islamic
Republic, a total of 285 cases of the disease have been confirmed
around the country. One person has also died from the H1N1 virus [the
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, presumably] since then. But swine flu
cases in Iran are mild, Khosrow-Nia said; we should be cautious but
not panicky. The severity doesn't seem to be much different than what
it is in the regular seasonal flu, Khosrow-Nia noted.

Mohammad-Mahi Guya, an official at the Infectious Diseases Department
of the Health Ministry, also said that regular seasonal influenza is
more dangerous than the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. Guya recommended
that high-risk groups (the old and those with chronic disease) should
get vaccinated against the [seasonal] flu before the flu season (the
autumn) sets in. Free seasonal flu shots are available for high-risk
groups [from the ministry].

The former health minister Kamran Baqeri-Lankarani also today [4 Sep
2009] spoke of the availability of the free seasonal flu shot in
pharmacies across the country. Speaking at his final meeting with the
ministry's deputies, Lankarani said: "The free flu shots are available
for high-risk groups across the country." High risk groups include
senior citizens (65 and over), infants under 5, and pregnant women,
anyone with a weak immune system or a chronic illness, and anyone with
asthma or heart disease. The meeting was also attended by the new
Health Minister Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi who was approved by the
Parliament on Thursday [3 Sep 2009] to become the 1st Iranian minister
since the history of the Islamic Revolution.

Swine flu [pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection] emerged in Mexico in
April [2009] and quickly spread around the globe. According to the
latest WHO figures issued on Friday [4 Sep 2009], more than 2837
people around the world have died from the virus over the past 4 months.

[Despite the absence of quantification, the above information
indicates that exposure to the influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus
conforms to the pattern observed in most other parts of the world.
Detailed statistical information from Iran would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
