Ongoing disease outbreaks in dogs - latest News, last modified 24 Sep 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Latest news:
Since [Mon 23 Sep 2019], the Norwegian Food Safety Authority has received 2 new reports on dogs with similar symptoms of disease. The cases are from Akershus and Hordaland.

These are cases that have been reported directly to the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and not as feedback via the survey sent to veterinarians. So far, an estimated 43 dogs with similar symptoms of disease have died.

The Norwegian Food Safety Authority's survey shows that almost 90 different dog breeds have had similar symptoms. See list under 'We know this so far' [article 2].

It is important to remember that diarrhea is a fairly common symptom in dogs, but often with less acute illness and seriousness. It is not always contagious and the cases may not be interconnected. Therefore, all the reports of dogs with bloody diarrhea cannot be put into context until we know what the disease is actually caused by.

Further work is being done to process information from the survey, while new responses are coming in. There is extensive work to systematize data on the dogs that are reported with these symptoms and to find any common features.

We are following several tracks in collaboration with the Veterinary Institute in the hope of finding the cause of the many cases of sick and dead dogs lately.

2. We know this so far:
We have received information on cases with similar symptoms from all the counties in the country.

We have been actively collaborating with the Veterinary Institute, NMBU Veterinary College and veterinary clinics to obtain information on those cases through a questionnaire that has been sent to veterinarians. Veterinarians also send in samples from sick dogs, and several dead dogs have been autopsied.

It is a comprehensive and time-consuming task to systematize information about the sick dogs and to find any common traits or connections between the cases. At this time, the search for possible causes is wide and includes viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites.

- Currently, there are no common traits among cases of sick dogs with regard to age, breed, feeding, contact with other dogs, areas and the like, except that many of the cases are from some counties in Eastern Norway.

- Preliminary responses may indicate an increase in illnesses with bloody diarrhea in dogs from approx. [20 Aug 2019]. The number of cases now seems to be on the decline. However, there is some uncertainty about this, as there may be missing or delayed reports submitted to the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and the Veterinary Institute.

- In most of the cases where several dogs shared the same household, only one dog became ill. This may indicate that if a common disease is involved, it is not very contagious between dogs.

- The Veterinary Institute has autopsied 15 dogs, all showing the same signs of bloody intestinal inflammation. The bacterium _Providencia alcalifaciens_ has so far been detected in 12 of these. The bacterium _Clostridium perfringens_ has been detected in several dogs. At this time we cannot say if these were the cause of the symptoms.

- The Veterinary Institute and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority believe that we can exclude several possible causes: Parvovirus, circovirus, _coronavirus_, _Giardia_ and _Cryptosporidium_ parasites, anthrax, EHEC, tularemia, distemper, the bacteria _Campylobacter_ and _Salmonella_, yeast poisoning, mushroom poisoning, mold poisoning [mycotoxins], (this does not cover all types of toxins that may occur naturally) and similar specific poisonings. Algae poisoning and tick-borne diseases are also unlikely.

[Though the investigation's efforts are impressive, this unusual, widely dispersed syndrome, characterised by haemorrhagic enteritis, remains enigmatic. So far, cases have been observed in dogs of 90 breeds; their listed names, some of which spelled in Norwegian, are available in the source url. The web-site presents also guidelines to practitioners.

The web-site includes also an exhaustive English version ("Serious illness in dogs", published 6 Sep 2019, modified 10 Sep 2019), as well as summaries in Spanish, Russian, Polish and German.

Due to the new disease cases in Norway, the Swedish Kennel Club, SKK, has decided to extend the stop for Norwegian dogs at Swedish exhibitions, tests, competitions and descriptions until 30 Sep 2019. In addition, SKK advises against traveling with the dog to Norway right now and appealed to Norwegian hunters not to take their dogs to hunting in Sweden. Dog owners who visited recently Norway with their dog, were advised to avoid allowing it to participate in Swedish events. - Mod.AS
