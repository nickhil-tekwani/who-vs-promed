Dozens of Quebec vacationers show signs of norovirus
----------------------------------------------------
A Montreal woman who became ill while attending her cousin's wedding in Cuba believes she and other members of her family picked up a virus during their vacation -- not on an airplane. She said about 25 of the 29 people who travelled with her to the resort town of Holguin became ill with either diarrhea, vomiting, or nausea. The group flew to Cuba on 9 Jan 2012 on a CanJet flight from Montreal. Not even the bride was spared, said [the woman, who is a nurse]. The bride became ill the day after her wedding and had to stay in her room. "As the week went by, more people were ill," recalled the nurse, who was sick for 24 hours. "It seemed to me to be a gastro because other people at the resort were also complaining about being sick." A doctor had to visit several of [the nurse's] relatives in their hotel rooms because they felt so weak, she said.

Air Transat announced this week that 45 of its passengers were ill while flying home on 3 flights from Holguin to Toronto and Ottawa. The sick passengers were examined by public health employees, who determined they did not need to be quarantined. About 15 passengers who landed in Montreal on Saturday night [21 Jan 2012] felt nauseated, said Debbie Cabana, an Air Transat spokesperson.

The Public Health Agency of Canada has notified Cuban officials of the illnesses and Cuban officials are trying to determine whether there is an outbreak of a specific virus, agency spokesperson Sylwia Gomes said. The sick tourists were showing symptoms consistent with norovirus, a highly contagious stomach bug.

Any passenger who still feels ill after returning from Cuba should see their doctor, Gomes said. Gastrointestinal illness is common in sun destinations, she said. Information regarding food and water when travelling to sun destinations has been updated on the agency's website.

Cabana [the Air Transat spokesperson] said it is unusual to have so many passengers felling ill at the same time. She said the airline has about 1000 tourists staying in various hotels in Holguin. "We are in contact with our people there and the hotels are taking measures to reinforce hygiene," she said. Cabana said also that the airline believes its passengers were already sick before they boarded the planes for their flights home. "We don't think they got the virus on our plane, but had contracted it at their destination," she said. The airline has been cleaning and disinfecting its planes as a precaution, she added.

A 2nd Montreal woman said members of their wedding party also became ill while staying at the same resort, the Sol Rio de Luna y Mares. The woman, who didn't want her name published, said she still feels a bit queasy one week after returning home on her CanJet flight.

All of the sick Canadian tourists had been vacationing in Holguin, but at different resorts.

[ProMED-mail does not normally report outbreaks of norovirus infection because the rapid onset/fast resolution characteristics of the infection means that many outbreaks are over before they can be reported. However, the outbreak described above illustrates how norovirus infection can be transmitted rapidly from one country to another as consequence of tourism and air transportation.

Noroviruses are a group of related, single-stranded RNA, non-enveloped viruses that cause acute gastroenteritis in humans. _Norovirus_ is the official genus name for the group of viruses previously described as "Norwalk-like viruses" (NLV) or small round structured viruses (SRSVs) because of their morphologic features. Noroviruses are part of the larger _Caliciviridae_ family, which also includes the genus _Sapovirus_, formerly described as "Sapporo-like viruses" (SLV) and sometimes referred to as classic or typical caliciviruses, which also cause gastroenteritis in humans.

Noroviruses are named after the original strain "Norwalk virus," which caused an outbreak of gastroenteritis in a school in Norwalk, Ohio, in 1968. Currently, there are 5 recognized norovirus genogroups, of which 3 (GI, GII, and GIV) are known to affect humans. More than 25 different genotypes have been identified within these genogroups. And since 2002, variants of the GII.4 genotype have been the most common cause of norovirus outbreaks.

The incubation period for norovirus-associated gastroenteritis in humans is usually between 24 and 48 hours (median in outbreaks, 33 to 36 hours), but cases can occur within 12 hours of exposure. Norovirus infection usually presents as acute-onset vomiting, watery non-bloody diarrhea with abdominal cramps, and nausea. Low-grade fever also occasionally occurs, and diarrhea is more common than vomiting in children. Dehydration is the most common complication, especially among the young and elderly, and may require medical attention. Symptoms usually last 24 to 72 hours. Recovery is usually complete and there is no evidence of any serious long-term sequelae. Studies with volunteers given the virus have shown that asymptomatic infection may occur in as many as 30 percent of infections, although the role of asymptomatic infection in norovirus transmission is not well understood.

Noroviruses are transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route, either by consumption of fecally contaminated food or water or by direct person-to-person spread. Environmental and fomite contamination may also act as a source of infection. Good evidence exists for transmission due to aerosolization of vomitus that presumably results in droplets contaminating surfaces or entering the oral mucosa and being swallowed. No evidence suggests that infection occurs through the respiratory system.

Noroviruses are highly contagious and as few as 10 viral particles may be sufficient to infect an individual. During outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis, several modes of transmission have been documented; for example, initial foodborne transmission in a restaurant, followed by secondary person-to-person transmission to household contacts. Although pre-symptomatic viral shedding may occur, shedding usually begins with onset of symptoms and may continue for 2 weeks or more after recovery. It is unclear to what extent viral shedding over 72 hours after recovery signifies continued infectivity.

Mechanisms of immunity to norovirus are unclear. It appears that immunity may be strain-specific and lasts only a few months; therefore, given the genetic variability of noroviruses, individuals are likely to be repeatedly infected throughout their lifetimes. This may explain the high attack rates in all ages reported in outbreaks. Recent evidence also suggests that susceptibility to infection may be genetically determined.
