Correspondents have pointed out the following 2 inaccuracies in the
ProMED-mail post titled: Hepatitis A - Sri Lanka (Gampola) 20070520.1606
[1]
Geographical error
------------------
Docteur Bertrand Gachot of the Institut Gustave-Roussy, 94805
Villejuif cedex - France has pointed out that the town of Gampola is
too small to be located on the map of Sri Lanka accompanying the
report and in fact it is located in the Central province of Sri Lanka
(not the Western province) in the district of Kandy:

Jody Lanard, M.D., of The Peter Sandman Risk Communication website
<http://www.psandman.com> has commented that the Moderator's
statement that "fortunately, there are no long term consequences of
hepatitis A infection, and recovery from infection confers permanent
immunity," is not strictly correct. The Hepatitis A Fact Sheet
published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention indicates that: "sometimes, people die as a result of
hepatitis A infection -- about 3-5 deaths per 1000 cases." (From:
"Hepatitis A vaccine: What You Need to Know", at:
