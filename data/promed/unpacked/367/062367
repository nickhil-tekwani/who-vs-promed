[We'd like to thank Dr. Louisa Woonton, Niue's Director of Health for the
attached outbreak warning. Following her message we'd like to start a
discussion on the issue raised by Dr. Woonton, about the importance of
streptococcal serology testing in guiding the subsequent case management of
suspected streptococcal pharyngitis. - YS]
OUTBREAK WARNING STARTS
***********************
Niue is currently experiencing an epidemic of a rheumatic fever type
illness and/or a viral illness yet to be identified conclusively.
The illness may have started in early June 1998. In late July, two children
from the same class at school were referred to New Zealand with sore
throat, fever, migrating joint pains and in one case, chorea. the girl with
chorea was subsequently confirmed as having acute rheumatic fever while
the other child was diagnosed with a viral illness or post streptococcal
polyarthralgia. despite efforts to clarify the diagnosis, New Zealand
authorities cannot confirm actual diagnosis for the second child.
Subsequently, several other children were admitted to the local hospital
similar symptoms and signs.
The illness affected mostly children under 20 years of age and most
presented with sore throat, high fever, joint pains and myalgia in some.
Approximately 50% were noticed to have large tonsils and some were
inflamed, with pustules present. Joint pains did not constitute arthritis
and almost all were arthralgia. Some children had epistaxis but no other
signs of bleeding were found. In most cases, the examination was
unremarkable and no abnormalities were found in the heart.
In most cases, the while cell counts were within normal limits and ESR
[erythrocyte sedimentation rate] were elevated to below 100mm per hour in a
few cases. In some cases, lymphopenia was present. Throat swabs and blood
cultures have so far failed to grow any streptococci. Blood samples have
been collected from all symptomatic patients as well as asymptotic children
during screening completed in all the villages. Tests for antibodies to
streptococci have been requested from Auckland Hospital where 266 first
[acute-phase] specimens have been sent. Convalescent-phase sera have not
been collected as we are only now in the convalescent phase for most of the
people affected.
I should point out that the epidemic is now affecting all age groups with
an increasing numbers of adults presenting with a respiratory illness. We
are preparing to collect viral swabs in addition to standard tests
described above.
[..] Niue authorities are happy with virology testing on a sample only but
would request streptococcal serology testing on all specimens collected
thus far so that we can inform families accordingly. Negative serology is
extremely useful because there is possibility that the early cases could
have been streptococcal pharyngitis with or without acute rheumatic fever.
Recent cases are possibly viral in origin. We cannot exclude the
possibility of streptococcal pharyngitis/acute rheumatic fever now followed
by an epidemic of a viral illness. Naturally, we are concerned not to
under-manage children who may have acute rheumatic fever.
Your assistance with further information if such cases are present
elsewhere in the Pacific. Support for streptococcal serology testing all
specimens would be appreciated.

OUTBREAK WARNING STOPS
**********************
[With regards to the outbreak's evolving pattern (age, symptoms, time) we
agree with Dr. Woonton on the need for further virology testing on a sample
of those specimens already taken. Concerning the issue of whether blood
specimens that have been taken (from symptomatic and asymptomatic children)
should all be serologically tested for the presence of ASO, our opinion is
to be considered from a public health efficiency point of view, and
according to our (limited) experience of Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF)
outbreaks. In communities where streptococcal infections may occur
endemically, ARF attack rates is usually very low (less than 1%) among
untreated pharyngitis cases, even when associated with positive throat
culture for group A streptococci AND serological evidence of ASO. Though
the literature also suggests that ARF attack rate is sensibly higher (2-3%)
among severe clinical forms of streptococcal throat infections supported by
bacterial and immunological evidences, about 1/3 of ARF cases occur after
asymptomatic streptococcal infection. Therefore, considering the above and
the magnitude of the current epidemic(s), the value of the serological
testing (for streptococcal antibodies) of all blood samples taken so far
appears to be low from a public health point of view, i.e., in order to
monitor the risk of occurrence of post-streptococcal syndromes in the
affected population. We would rather recommend to raise clinicians'
awareness on the early diagnosis and treatment of post-streptococcal
syndromes. Having said so, PACNET accounts for much better qualified
colleagues on this particular topic. We would like now to hand over the
discussion to them. - YS/TK]

I read with interest Dr. Louisa Woonton's message on PACNET regarding the
outbreak of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) in Niue. I am a consultant in
paediatrics and child health in Samoa. My main interests are in public
health and rheumatic fever, which is why I have been managing our rheumatic
fever program for the last ten years.
1. ARF is a post-strep pharyngitis condition so a pharyngitis occurring
simultaneously with fever and migratory arthralgia is extremely unlikely to
be acute rheumatic fever.
2. Chorea is definitely a sign of ARF.
3. The ESR in ARF is always elevated - rarely below 80mm/hr.
4. ASO titres, while useful, are expensive and lack specificity and
sensitivity for ARF. The limited Pacific medical literature shows that most
Pacific island children have high titres anyway (Elliot et al 1984) perhaps
because of the high prevalence of streptococcal carriage rates in the
throat and skin.
5. While I still do ASO titres as part of a Group A _Streptococcus_ work-up
I do not rely on the result to guide our management of sore throats. Our
MOH is currently finalising a policy whereby every sore throat in children
between the ages of 5 - 15 years is treated with penicillin. While this may
seem like overkill, and rather unscientific, our rates of ARF are one of
the highest in the world - so we are going for the no-thrills approach!
This has been done successfully before - see Paediatrics, May 1989: the
Costa Rican experience.
6. I believe the outbreak in Niue is viral in origin - most probably a
coxsackievirus or a parainfluenzavirus.
7. For the information of our readers we have just published the results of
epidemiological survey looking at the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease
and its risk factors in 10,000 school children. Furthermore we also looked
at the prevalence of Group A streptococcal pharyngitis and Group A
streptococcal pyoderma and the skin and throat carriage rates of Group A
_Streptococcus_ (GAS). I believe the GAS that causes proderma is
genetically similar to the throat GAS. The Public Health Research Lab in
Darwin [Australia] is currently analysing these and it would be very
interesting to se what the results are. I will keep you posted. If anyone
is interested to discuss this further - drop me a line.
