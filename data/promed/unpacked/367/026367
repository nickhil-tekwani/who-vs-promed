LIVESTOCK DISEASE SUMMARY: OIE NOV 19
*************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promed@promedmail.org>
Date: Mon, 22 Nov 1999
From: Peter Cowen <peter_cowen@ncsu.edu>

In an effort to be "information lean" and carefully limit the number of our
postings, ProMED-mail has decide to provide periodic summaries of relevant
animal disease outbreaks from OIE and FAO. We will only report new
outbreaks of disease and their sequelae. We will generally not provide
updates on important disease control events such as the progress of the
Rinderpest Eradication campaign. While acknowledging the significance of
worldwide animal health campaigns, we also declare them to be outside our
domain.
The source for these summaries is Disease Information, on-line publication
of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). For further details on
any of the outbreaks summarized here, see
<http://www.oie.int/Info/AIS_17.HTM>.
We will also monitor and report new information from the FAO EMPRES system,
an animal disease monitoring system focused on rinderpest, contagious
bovine pleuropneumonia, foot-and-mouth disease, peste des petits ruminants,
Rift Valley fever, Newcastle disease, lumpy skin disease, African swine
Fever. For more information from EMPRES system see:
<http://www.fao.org/WAICENT/FAOINFO/AGRICULT/AGA/AGAH/EMPRES/EMPRES.HTM>

NEW DISEASE OUTBREAKS-OIE:

SWINE FEVER, CLASSICAL - LUXEMBOURG
-----------------------------------
[see also:
Swine fever, classical - Germany (Brandenberg) 990819165509]
Report date: 16 November 1999
A wild boar shot at Beiler (near the northern border of the country) was
positive on serum neutralization testing for classical swine fever.
The surveillance zone, set up on 10 October 1999 following the declaration
of a case of classical swine fever in a wild boar close to the border with
Germany, has been extended over a radius of 10 km in Luxembourg, including
the districts of Weiswampach,Troisvierges, Heinerscheid and a part of the
district of Wincrange.

AFRICAN SWINE FEVER - PORTUGAL
------------------------------
Report date: 17 November 1999.
A farm in the Alentejo region (in the southern part of the country) was
infected on 3 November. 6 pigs died and the remaining 38 pigs on the farm
were destroyed.
Diagnosis: laboratory confirmation (virus isolation) on 15 Nov 1999.
[ASF is essentially endemic in Iberia. Portugal has an excellent
diagnostic lab - Mod.PC]

FOLLOW-UP REPORTS ON OUTBREAKS - OIE
FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE, CATTLE - TURKEY
---------------------------------------
[see also
Foot and mouth disease - Turkey 991112094014]
In Agri province, the disease has not spread to other herds. There have
been no additional deaths in the outbreaks since the emergency report date.
A total of 14,618 cattle, which are kept in 28 villages, have been
vaccinated against foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus type Asia 1 using a
vaccine produced at the SAP Institute in Ankara (ring vaccination).
There has been one new outbreak in Derekoy village, Pazar district, Tokat
province. It appears that a truck (or some would say lorry) driver visited
cattle markets in the region of the previously reported outbreak in
Anatolia. Transmission is suspected to be by contact with his contaminated
vehicle (not uncommon for FMD - Mod.PC). There is no indication that the
cattle in the infected village have been destroyed yet, but a ring
vaccination control has been instituted.

AFRICAN SWINE FEVER - GHANA
---------------------------
