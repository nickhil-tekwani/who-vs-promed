For recreational anglers on Lake St. Clair and the Detroit River --
and others who make their living on those waters -- concerns are
rising over the impact of the disease viral hemorrhagic septicemia
(VHS). Scientists do not consider VHS a threat to human health. But
it could deal a severe blow to many local industries that thrive off
the fish in Lake St. Clair, Lake Erie, the Detroit River and the St.
Clair River. In response to thousands of dead fish reported last year
[2006], state environmental officials have drawn up an action plan
for 2007 that calls for shuffling resources to better monitor the
spread of VHS. They are also studying ways to fight the disease,
which has already jumped from one species in Lake St. Clair area to
at least 5. There is no cure or vaccine proven to be effective.
"Right now, we're just praying we can keep it out of the inland
waters and fisheries," said Kelley D. Smith, the Michigan Department
of Natural Resource's (DNR) Fisheries Division chief. "The fishing
industries are going to be hard hit for a while."
While no additional funding is available this year [2007] to the
department, Smith said some inland testing programs will be curtailed
or cut and those funds will go toward testing in the lake areas to
monitor the spread of VHS.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture reacted to the spread of the
disease in August 2006 by issuing an alert describing VHS as an
"emerging disease." Three months later, the federal government locked
down the shipping of live fish and bait in the Great Lakes region.
Last week, Ontario placed similar restrictions on shipping to keep
the virus from spreading into Canada's inland waterways.
Smith said one possible directive would restrict the use of bait
minnows taken from water known to have VHS-infected fish. Fishermen
may be barred from using those minnows in bodies of water that have
not had infections reported, to keep the disease from being
introduced into new areas. Such a directive would be legally
enforceable by the state.
State officials admit they simply don't know what course VHS may take
this year [2007]. The disease works quickly, causing a fish's liver,
spleen and intestines to hemorrhage. Internal bleeding can result in
lesions and sores that are outwardly visible to fishermen. Prior to
death, the fish become lethargic, swimming in circles or remaining
relatively motionless near the surface. Its effects have not been
missed by area fishermen.
"We've had fish viruses before, even one or 2 that might have caused
sores on the fish," said Chimelak. "But the number of dead muskies we
saw last spring [2006] really makes this one stand out. And I've
never had as many people coming into the shop talking about dead fish
as we had last year."
The earliest recorded appearance of VHS in Lake St. Clair was 2003.
In both 2005 and 2006, large die-offs indicated the disease had
spread. At least 5 species in the lake are known to be susceptible to
the disease, and testing underway now could add more to the list that
includes: freshwater trout and perch, gobies, emerald shiners and muskies.
Scientists believe the waters from the St. Lawrence River to Lake St.
Clair are already compromised by the disease and that more [water]
bodies will inevitably be contaminated. "Eventually, it will get
through [all] the Great Lakes, and we'll be approaching this from a
management standpoint," Smith said. " Everything we're trying to do
these days focuses on slowing the spread of the disease to buy time
so we can understand it better."
A best-case scenario, according to Smith, would be for VHS to follow
the pattern of another fish disease in the Great Lakes region,
Bacterial Kidney Disease (BKD). In the mid-1980s, BKD struck chinook
and salmon in Lake Michigan and caused large-scale mortalities in
those species. Within a few years, the disease had spread through the
lakes surrounding Michigan. But the die-offs eventually came to a
halt when fish built up an immunity to it. While BKD is still
detectable in Great Lakes fish, it no longer kills them.
VHS is a viral fish disease 1st identified in the Lake St. Clair area
in 2003. It is not considered a health threat to humans, and infected
fish can still be consumed. Scientists say the waters connected from
the St. Lawrence River west to Lake St. Clair have fish infected with
VHS. Eventually, officials expect the virus to reach all of the Great Lakes.
Fish contract the disease through urine, feces and sexual fluids,
often entering through the gills or wounds. While they are not sure,
scientists believe VHS most likely arrived through contaminated
ballast water discharged here. [Ballast: heavy material such as
rocks or water that is placed in the hold of a lightly loaded ship to
enhance stability. Ballast water would have been taken on in an
infected area, then discharged when the ship is loaded at another
port. That is how cholera was carried from China to Peru in 1991 to
start the 1st outbreak of cholera in South America for 100 years. - Mod.JW]

Fish-killing virus confirmed in Lake Huron
-----------------------------------------------
An aquatic virus that doesn't harm people but kills fish has made its
way to Lake Huron, state officials said Thu 25 Jan 2007.
The Michigan Department of Natural Resources said it confirmed the
presence of viral hemorrhagic septicema, or VHS, in fish taken from
Thunder Bay and from waters off Rogers City and
Cheboygan. Previously, VHS had been found only in 2 of the Great
Lakes -- Ontario and Erie -- and in Lake St. Clair. But officials
have predicted the virus eventually would spread across the entire lake system.
Infected fish in Lake Huron include whitefish, walleye and Chinook
salmon. All are popular sport and commercial species.
"The continuing march of VHS through the waters of the Great Lakes is
a major challenge to our agency and our management options," DNR
Director Rebecca Humphries said.
Last October [2006], the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) banned
shipments of 37 species of live fish from the Great Lakes states in a
bid to check the spread of VHS.
Responding to complaints that the measure was damaging the region's
fishing industry, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) later modified its order. The agency now allows some
fish to be taken across state lines with proper documentation. The
agency is working with state officials to craft a long-term policy.
