In 2002, endemic transmission of measles was interrupted in the
Americas, and in 2009, interruption of rubella's endemic transmission
was achieved. Since 2003, historically low numbers of measles cases
-- both imported and imported-related -- have been registered: 119 in
2008, 108 in 2004, 85 in 2005, 237 in 2006, 167 in 2007, 207 in 2008,
and 81 in 2009.

In the 2008-2009 period, 199 secondary cases were registered as a
result of a total of 69 importations, while the source for 24 cases
were unknown. The notified measles cases reported in the Americas
have been isolated or sporadic, and the outbreaks have resulted in
limited secondary cases due to importation.

During this year [2010], measles cases, imported and
imported-related, have been registered in Argentina, Brazil, Canada,
the United States, and French Guyana. From January to 21 Aug 2010,
143 confirmed measles cases have been registered, 40 of which were
imported, 37 imported-related, and 66 of which are still under
investigation or whose source of infection is unknown.

In order to prevent the re-introduction of measles and rubella
viruses in the region, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)
encourages countries to continue observing the Technical Advisory
Group's (TAG) recommendations concerning surveillance, vaccination
strategies, and laboratory-related issues [see:
<http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1862&Itemid=358&lang=en>].
Moreover, PAHO recommends the countries of the region to adopt the
following measures:

Surveillance:
---------------
- Achieve an adequate level of preparedness through the elaboration
of national preparedness and rapid response plans in the event of a
an importation.

- Actively involve the private sector in the surveillance of
measles, rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) to support the
rapid detection of importations and response to outbreaks, as well as
vaccination activities.

- Guarantee the total integration of measles and rubella
surveillance systems, in order to achieve high quality surveillance
-- placing emphasis on high risk and "silent" zones.

Vaccination Strategies:
-----------------------------
- Maintain regular, high, and homogenous (over 95 percent)
vaccination coverage in every municipality through the administration
of the 1st routine dose. Also, monitor the accumulation of
susceptible people and continue the execution of national tracing campaigns.

- Following TAG's recommendations, any resident of the Americas who
travels to areas where measles or rubella cases have been reported
must be immune to these viruses prior to his/her departure.

Laboratory:
----------
- Establish priorities to obtain samples for viral detection,
putting emphasis on suspect cases with a high exposure probability
(patients with a travel history, or people who have received visits
from individuals with a travel history, and workers or their
relatives who have a link to the tourism sector) or that come from
high risk localities (inter alia, areas where the virus is
circulating, areas of frequent tourism, high traffic bordering areas,
and industrial areas).

- Use or adapt, according to each country's needs, WHO laboratory
testing algorithms for the classification of measles and rubella
cases. Cases must be classified only after the laboratory and
epidemiological teams have examined all the analyses and
epidemiological data results.

- The laboratories must try to determine the initial genetic
composition of measles and rubella viruses through typification of cases.

[This alert has been issued as a consequence of the fact that measles
virus infection has become more prevalent in some parts of the world
during 2010, with measles cases, imported and imported related,
occurring in the Americas, specifically Argentina, Brazil, Canada,
the United States, and French Guyana. - Mod.CP]
