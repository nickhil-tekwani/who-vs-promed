Public health officials and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) are continuing to see an elevated number of hepatitis A cases in Southeast Michigan [SE MI].

Since the beginning of the outbreak in August 2016, public health response has included increased healthcare awareness efforts, public notification and education, and outreach with vaccination clinics for high-risk populations. No common sources of food, beverages, or drugs have been identified as a potential source of infection. Transmission appears to be through direct person-to-person spread and illicit drug use. Those with history of injection and non-injection drug use, homelessness or transient housing, and incarceration are thought to be at greater risk in this outbreak setting. Notably, this outbreak has had a high hospitalization rate.

A hepatitis A outbreak has hit several states across the country, killing dozens of people and potentially sickening thousands. Michigan has been hardest-hit in terms of deaths, with 22. The outbreak there began in August 2016 and, after a drop off during the winter, continued to climb last year [2017], according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

"We currently have 677 cases in Michigan and continue to see approximately 15-20 cases matching into the cluster every week," Lynn Sutfin, spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, wrote in an email. "The Michigan outbreak now includes 15 different county jurisdictions. We believe that person-to-person transmission is the primary route of infection."

Fighting the outbreak was challenging in some jurisdictions due to a national shortage of the vaccine for hepatitis A. "Vaccine supply is still 'constrained,' " Sutfin wrote. "We continue to prioritize vaccine to the highest risk individuals that have been identified and focus our vaccination efforts in the parts of the state who are experiencing the largest number of cases." Vaccine supplier Merck said the shortage of pre-filled syringes, the easiest to administer, would not ease until the 2nd quarter of 2018. However, vials containing 10 single doses are available. "The company is taking steps to continue to increase our capacity to meet demand globally in 2018," Merck spokeswoman Pamela Eisele wrote in an email. "We apologize for any inconvenience this supply availability may be causing."

The only other vaccine maker, GlaxoSmithKline, said it has adult hepatitis A vaccine in prefilled syringes in stock and is "working diligently to increase our supply." The company is also working closely with the CDC, spokeswoman Robin Gaitens wrote in an email, to ensure that its vaccines "are directed to areas of greatest need."

The Grand Traverse County Health Department has confirmed 5 cases of hepatitis A in northern Michigan. 4 of the cases were reported in Grand Traverse County and 1 in Leelanau County. The cases were linked this week to a larger outbreak in Southeast Michigan.

Of the 677 cases reported in Michigan since 1 Aug 2016, the health department said 82 percent of those cases were serious enough to need hospitalization. "This outbreak is growing," said Wendy Hirschenberger, Health Officer for the Grand Traverse County Health Department. "It's still focused primarily in southeast Michigan but as we know people travel, so we want to get the word out to people with the highest risk."

Health leaders say this strain of hepatitis A appears to be more severe, and has doctors concerned because it's impacting a different population of people than they've seen with previous outbreaks. "Usually hepatitis A is a foodborne illness," said Salah Qutaishat, PhD, of Munson Medical Center Infection Prevention. "We talk about fecal oral transmission. This is completely different."

[The continued outbreak in Michigan is growing in numbers and slowly spreading as the parallel outbreak in Southern California, mostly San Diego county, is slowing to a halt. What is different about both of these large outbreaks is not that they are not fecal-oral spread -- they are -- but rather that the spread has been facilitated by extremely poor sanitary conditions among homeless and otherwise disadvantaged individuals. San Diego, at least from what has been made public, has addressed the need for changes in the paradigm of prevention in its outbreak by environmental cleanup and the availability of more portable toilets. It is not clear if similar steps have been taken in Michigan.

Grand Traverse and Leelanau counties are located in the far northwestern aspects of the lower peninsula of the state. They can be located on a map at: https://geology.com/county-map/michigan.shtml. Detroit in southeastern Michigan (Wayne county) is located about 260 miles (about 418 km) from Traverse City, the county seat for Grand Traverse county. - Mod.LL]

The Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH) reported 3 additional hepatitis A cases during the 1st week of 2018, bringing the outbreak total to 62 since the beginning of 2017.

Of this total, 51 of the patients required hospitalization for their illness. An increase in cases since 1 Aug 2017, primarily among individuals who were homeless or drug users, prompted the declaration of a statewide outbreak in November 2017. Viral sequencing has linked several outbreak-associated cases in Kentucky with outbreaks in California and Utah.

KDPH is working closely with the CDC and local health departments to provide guidance and education to health professionals and at-risk populations. Treatment for acute hepatitis A generally involves supportive care, with specific complications treated as appropriate. Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease.
