[The location, near the Afghanistan border, can be seen appended to
the OIE report or at the HealthMap website. The outbreak does involve
substantial numbers of animals, and there is a significant amount of
FMD activity in the larger region. The report from Kyrgyzstan details
high level consultations within the country in trying to cope with
their outbreak. Furthermore, Kazakhstan has banned imports from
Kyrgyzstan.

With all this activity, it is imperative that more information on the
outbreak subtype be made available and better epidemiological insights
be provided. Indicating that the epidemiological situation consisted
of contact with infected animals at grazing or at water holes doesn't
really help us understand how the disease got into Tajikistan in the
1st place, or its likelihood to spread given the control measures
adopted. - Mod.PC]
