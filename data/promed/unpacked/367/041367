Venezuela: 1st Outbreak of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis for 3 Years
---------------------------------------------------
Venezuelan equine encephalitis has reemerged in the country after being
absent or controlled by health authorities for more than 3 years.
Representatives of the National Breeders' Federation (FEDENAGA) reported
that the disease has affected animals in 2 ranches in the state of Barinas
(municipality of Arismendi). The sanitary authorities have confirmed this
information.

[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) was first isolated from a
horse in Venezuela in 1938. It is closely related to Eastern equine
encephalitis virus (EEEV) and Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), all
3 being classified as distinct species in the genus _Alphavirus_ of the
family _Togaviridae_. These viruses produce encephalitis in equines and
humans, and differ in geographical distribution, as their names suggest.
Phylogenetically, VEEV is more closely related to EEEV than to WEEV. VEEV
causes veterinary and public health problems mainly in Central and South
America. Focal outbreaks occur periodically, and occasionally regional
epizootics are responsible for large numbers of equine cases and deaths. In
1995 an epidemic in Columbia and Venezuela caused around 75 000 human
cases. Infection of humans with VEEV, however, tends to be less severe than
infection with EEEV or WEEV, and fatalities are rare.
An effective live virus vaccine is available for containment of animal
disease. 6 antigenic subtypes of VEEV (and variants within these subtypes)
are recognized, which have differing distributions and biological
properties; but only 2 (subtypes I and II) are associated with human disease.
VEEV is maintained in cycles involving forest-dwelling rodents and mosquito
vectors (_Culex_ spp.). The natural reservoir hosts of some epizootic
strains are not known, however, and equines were the amplifying hosts in
the 1995 outbreak in Columbia and Venezuela, which resulted in many human
cases. In the context of risk to the human population, it would be useful
to extend diagnostic testing to the subtype level. - Mod.CP]
