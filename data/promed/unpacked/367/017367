So far in 2011, there are 4 confirmed cases of hantavirus
[infections]. According to information from Public Health, these
[patients] are recovering favorably. Of these [4 patients], 3 are from
Oran and one from Pichanal [Salta province in northwestern Argentina.
- Mod.LJS] In 2010, there were 30 positive cases and in 2009 the total
was 29.

The officials responsible for epidemiology stated that [a] hantavirus
[infection] is a disease that begins with symptoms similar to flu. In
3 days, there is difficulty in breathing.

[The infection] is acquired breathing the virus that is found in
dried feces of rodent [hosts].

[This report does not indicate which hantavirus is involved in these
cases. Oran virus is a likely candidate.

Several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in
Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy
rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like
viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown);
Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O.
flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_);
and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_) virus.
