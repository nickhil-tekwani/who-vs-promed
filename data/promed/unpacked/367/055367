South Australia's largest supplier of gelati [Italian-style ice cream -
Mod.JW] has been blamed for a _Salmonella_ food-poisoning outbreak that so
far has affected 83 people.

Newton-based Alba Gelati has recalled its product from supermarkets, delis
and restaurants as health authorities try to establish the source of the
bacteria.

The Health Commission said yesterday the 83 cases of _Salmonella
oranienberg_ [infection] had been reported since the middle of March.

Most of the victims had been treated by their own doctors but several had
needed hospital treatment.

Alba Gelati supplies about 600 outlets across the State and in the Northern
Territory. These include cafes, restaurants and supermarket chains Coles
and Franklins.

Department of Health Services Communicable Disease Control Branch director,
Dr Robert Hall, said yesterday the outbreak had been linked to the Italian
food after an intensive investigation lasting several weeks.

"People should not consume any Alba gelati they have in their freezers," Dr
Hall said.

"The gelati should be destroyed or returned to the shop where it was
purchased."

Dr Hall said extensive tests at the Alba factory had not found any problems.

Alba's managing partner, Mr Frank Mattiassi, said yesterday the cause had
not yet been identified despite testing of the factory's ingredients and
swabs taken from the plant.

"We are working closely with the Health Commission and our investigations
are continuing to identify the possible introductory source," Mr Mattiassi
said.

"Our main priority is public safety," Mr Papa said. "The Health Commission
has helped us in every way and what they've said, we've done."

Dr Hall said yesterday South Australia had between 300 and 1,000 cases of
[salmonellosis per] year.
