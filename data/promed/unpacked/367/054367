Euro Surveill. 2017; 22(5): pii=30456. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.5.30456]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We describe a case of severe swine influenza A(H1N1) virus infection in an immuno-competent middle-aged man in October 2016 in Italy who had only indirect exposure to pigs. The patient developed a severe acute distress respiratory syndrome which was successfully supported by extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation and treated with antiviral therapy. The sole risk factor for influenza was a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2. After a month of hospitalisation, the patient was discharged in good health.

Virological findings
--------------------
Molecular subtyping of the influenza A strain (A/Pavia/65/2016) was unsuccessful using real-time RT-PCRs specific for human influenza subtypes H1 and H3 directly on biological samples. On day 7 of admission, partial nucleotide sequences of the nucleoprotein and non-structural genes, obtained in an RT-PCR that amplifies all 8 segments of the influenza A genome showed that the A/Pavia/65/2016 strain was an influenza A(H1N1) virus of swine origin.

A phylogenetic tree of the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuroaminidase (NA) genes constructed using MEGA6 software confirmed that the A/Pavia/65/2016 strain was closely related to the European avian-like swine influenza A(H1N1) virus.

The patient had not had any direct contact with pigs but lived with a brother employed as a breeder on a pig farm. When interviewed, the patient's brother reported having had mild respiratory symptoms, in late September to early October [2016]. Virological investigations on the pig farm mid-October showed an absence of clinical signs in the animals, but nasal swabs collected from 12 weaning pigs resulted positive by PCR for influenza A, although at a low viral load. Partial genome sequencing of one of the strains (A/swine/Italy/285919/3/2016) included complete HA, NA, M, NS genes and partial PB2, PB1, PA, and NP segments (GenBank accession numbers KY368155-162) and proved its close relationship with the A/Pavia/65/2016 strain, placing it among the Eurasian swine influenza virus (SIV) avian-like strains circulating in Italy.

Discussion
----------
Exposure to swine is often considered a risk factor for human SIV infections. Here we describe a severe case of swine influenza A(H1N1) virus infection requiring [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation] in an adult immunocompetent man with a BMI greater than 30 as a risk factor, who had indirect exposure to pigs through a brother working as a breeder on a pig farm. 12 pigs of the farm tested positive for influenza A, and the strain sequenced from one of them was closely related to the virus recovered from the patient. In addition, antibodies against swine influenza A strains (including the strain recovered from the patient) were detected in the serum sample of the patient's brother. These data support the hypothesis that SIV infecting our patient was circulating on the pig farm and the patient's brother might have operated as a bridge for transmission of the virus. In our phylogenetic analysis of HA and NA, this Dutch strain and the strain A/Pavia/65/2016, circulating in the same period in Europe, clustered into distinct branches of the trees.

[Borrowing from the above article's background section: "Since the 1st isolation of a swine influenza virus (SIV) from a human in 1974 [1], sporadic human cases of SIV have been reported in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia [2-4]. Although most cases of SIV in humans are associated with mild respiratory syndromes [1-4], a case of severe SIV has recently been reported in the Netherlands [5]. Exposure to pigs is often considered a risk factor for human SIV infections and seroepidemiological studies have demonstrated increased rates of SIV infection in occupationally exposed humans [1-3]. People with exposure to swine may be the first to be infected in the event of a novel virus becoming epizootic in a swine herd, and those who work with swine may operate as a bridge for transmission of the virus to their communities [2]."
