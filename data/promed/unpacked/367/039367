Public urged to use Tennant Creek dengue hotline
-------------------------------------------------
A hotline phone has been established in a bid to stop the spread of
mosquitoes carrying dengue fever from Tennant Creek to other Northern
Territory towns.

The disease was detected on 20 Feb 2004, and an extensive program has been
set up in a bid to eradicate the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which carries
the infection.

The Territory Centre for Disease Control wants anyone who finds mosquito
larvae in containers on their properties to call the hotline.

The centre's Peter Whelan says people should also call if they have not
been visited by a member of the eradication team. He says all containers
should be turned upside down or treated with surface spray if they have
held water in the past 3 weeks.

The hotline number is 1800 008 002.

Dengue fever found in NT mosquitoes
-----------------------------------
The Northern Territory's Communicable Disease Centre says an infestation of
a mosquito (_Aedes aegypti_) that can carry dengue fever has been in
Tennant Creek since the start of the rains in the Top End.

The centre's medical entomologist, Peter Whelan, says a survey of Tennant
Creek has found the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes breeding in 44 locations.

Mr Whelan says the insect may have been brought in as eggs in a receptacle
from Queensland during the last year's wet season. He says the extent of
the infestation indicates the mosquito has been in the town since December
2003.

Mr Whelan says the Northern Territory has been free of the mosquito since
the late 1950s.

He is urging people to stop the insect from breeding to prevent dengue
fever outbreaks like those occurring in North Queensland.

[There are several incidences of _Ae. aegypti_ being eradicated from areas
only to reappear, sometimes after many years. For example, in the 1970s
this mosquito was eradicated from a number of South American countries, but
by the mid 1990s _Ae. aegypti_ had reinvaded many of them. With regard to
Australia, populations of _Ae. aegypti_ in Queensland were greatly reduced
in the 1970s, but after an absence of 26 years, dengue was again reported
from Queensland in 1981/82.
