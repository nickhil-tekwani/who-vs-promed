WHO Statement on the 2nd Meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee concerning MERS-CoV

WHO Statement - [17 Jul 2013]

The 2nd meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the Director-General under the International Health Regulations (2005) [IHR (2005)] was held by teleconference on Wednesday [17 Jul 2013], from 12:00 to 16:04 Geneva time (CET).

In addition to Members of the Emergency Committee, an expert advisor to the Committee1 participated in the meeting. During the informational session of the meeting, several affected States Parties were also on the teleconference. The States Parties on the teleconference were: France, Germany, Italy, Jordan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom.

The Committee reviewed and deliberated on information on a range of aspects of MERS-CoV, which was prepared or coordinated by the Secretariat and States in response to questions presented by Members during the 1st meeting.

It is the unanimous decision of the Committee that, with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met.

While not considering the events currently to constitute a PHEIC, Members of the Committee did offer technical advice for consideration by WHO and Member States on a broad range of issues, including the following:

- Improvements in surveillance, lab capacity, contact tracing and serological investigation
- Infection prevention and control and clinical management
- Travel-related guidance
- Risk communications
- Research studies (epidemiological, clinical and animal)
- Improved data collection and the need to ensure full and timely reporting of all confirmed and probable cases of MERS-CoV to WHO in accordance with the IHR (2005).

The WHO Secretariat will provide regular updates to the Members and will reconvene the Committee, in September [2013], on a date to be determined. However, serious new developments may require an urgent re-convening of the Committee before then.

Based on these views and the currently available information, the Director-General accepted the Committee's assessment that the current MERS-CoV situation is serious and of great concern, but does not constitute a PHEIC at this time.

The Director-General expressed her gratitude to the Committee on its wide range of advice on health actions for countries to implement, and advice on follow-up work by WHO.

1 Please note that the listing of Emergency Committee Members on the WHO website has been updated to include the adviser to the Committee.

[The above is the official statement of the WHO IHR Emergency Committee that was convened to assess the global risks of MERS-CoV. At present, the Committee felt that "with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met." The term Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) is defined in the IHR (2005) as "an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response." This definition implies a situation that: is serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected; carries implications for public health beyond the affected State's national border; and may require immediate international action. (see http://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/pheic/en/ for a description of PHEIC procedures).
