Maine's number of Lyme disease cases will exceed 1000 for the 4th straight year. The Portland Press Herald reports the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention reported 1231 Lyme infections through November this year [2014]. That figure is on track to be the 2nd highest on record.

State data show the state has exceeded 1000 cases every year since 2011 and set a record of 1377 cases in 2013. That figure is more than 5 times the number reported a decade ago according to the Maine CDC.

A new lab scheduled for completion at the University of Maine in 2017 is expected to accelerate the process of identifying infected ticks. That will give doctors information more quickly and could speed up diagnosis and treatment of the tick-borne illness.

[In prior ProMED-mail posts of tick-borne diseases in the US state of Maine this year, the number of the Lyme disease cases in this state were said to be down significantly so far this year [2014]; more than 1377 cases of Lyme disease were reported in 2013, compared to close to 1000 cases in the 1st 9 months of 2014 (ProMED-mail post Anaplasmosis - USA (02): (ME) increased incidence, update 20141013.2857236). According to the news report above, the number of Lyme disease cases for the 1st 11 months of 2014 is 1231, while the number of cases reported in Maine of anaplasmosis and babesiosis, 2 other diseases transmitted by the _Ixodes scapularis_, were said to be increasing.

The increased incidence of anaplasmosis and babesiosis in Maine can be due to a true increase in the number of cases as the primary tick vector (_Ixodes scapularis_) and the reservoir hosts spread geographically into previously uninvolved regions; but also better recognition and reporting of anaplasmosis and babesiosis may contribute to their increases in cases, which may explain their increased incidence despite lower numbers of Lyme disease cases. - Mod.ML
