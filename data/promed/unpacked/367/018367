Manitoba: First Human Death Attributed to West Nile Virus Infection
--------------------------------------------------
The first human death attributed to West Nile virus infection in Manitoba
has been identified. The individual, a man in his 60s from Portage la
Prairie died from West Nile virus neurological syndrome. He also had an
underlying chronic medical condition.
In addition, there are 7 new probable human cases of West Nile virus
infection in Manitoba, bringing the total number of West Nile human cases
to 18 (2 confirmed and 16 probable). [Up from the figure of 8 probable and
2 confirmed listed in the Health Canada Surveillance Data of Tue 9 Sep
2003. - Mod.CP]. 5 women and 2 men ranging in age from 49 to 70 have been
identified. These individuals are from the regional health authorities of
Assiniboine (4), Interlake (2) and Winnipeg (one).
Of the 8 new cases [presumably the death and the 7 new probable cases], 2
have been identified as West Nile virus neurological syndrome, which
includes encephalitis, meningitis, or other nervous system disorders. 3 of
these cases have been identified as West Nile virus fever, which is usually
a mild illness. Three cases have yet to be classified.
6 of the 18 Manitoba cases are West Nile virus neurological syndrome and 8
are West Nile virus fever. One case, discovered through the testing of
donated blood by Canadian Blood Services, has been reported to Health
Canada as an asymptomatic case of West Nile virus infection. Three cases
are yet to be classified. In addition, Manitobans continue to be assessed
for West Nile virus infection, and many are still undergoing further testing.
These recent West Nile virus cases reflect exposure to mosquitoes in the
month of August 2003. Although mosquito counts are generally lower, there
are still infected mosquitoes in Southern Manitoba that may be active,
particularly in warmer weather. All Manitobans, especially those over the
age of 50 or with chronic medical conditions or weakened immune systems,
are advised to: reduce the amount of time outdoors from dusk to dawn when
mosquitoes are most active; wear light-coloured, loose-fitting,
long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outside; use insect repellent
containing DEET; and check that door and window screens fit tightly and are
free of holes.
To date, 216 mosquito samples have tested positive for West Nile virus, of
which 184 are _Culex tarsalis_. Positive mosquito samples have been
identified in Winnipeg, Winkler, Virden, Steinbach, St. Andrews, West St.
Paul, Selkirk, Russell, Killarney, Boissevain, Deloraine, Stony Mountain,
Brandon, Portage la Prairie, and Beausejour.
As of Wed 10 Sep 2003, 125 birds, 37 horses, and 20 sentinel chickens have
tested positive for West Nile virus infection. Additional information is
available on the Manitoba Health West Nile virus Web-site at
