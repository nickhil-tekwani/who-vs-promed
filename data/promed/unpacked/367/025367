Cote d'Ivoire finds 12 new cases of polio
---------------
A total of 12 confirmed cases of polio have turned up in less than a
year in Cote d'Ivoire, one of the West African countries where the
disease was thought to have been eradicated. Almost all cases have
been registered in the rebel-held northern part of the country, where
most health institutions have ceased functioning.
According to the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs (OCHA), "the 12th confirmed case of polio in Cote d'Ivoire in
less than a year marks a drastic increase" from zero the year before.
The number of confirmed cases has risen from 8 to 12 cases in 4
months, the UN agency informed today.
The latest cases have all been confirmed in the northern zone of the
country, where medical services have been largely cut off since the
country plunged into conflict 2 years ago. The northern zone is
controlled by the Forces Nouvelles rebels, and most state
institutions here have ceased functioning.
The UN's Children Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organisation
(WHO) have carried out 4 national immunisation campaigns in Cote
d'Ivoire in 2004, the latest being between 8 and 11 Oct [2004]. The 2
agencies are now appealing to international donors for funds to carry
out another 2 rounds of polio and measles vaccinations before the end
of the year.
To date, humanitarian agencies have received just 6 percent of the US
$14.3 million they have requested to carry out emergency health
programmes in the country, according to OCHA. In terms of overall
percentages, "Cote d'Ivoire has received less than any other" country
where anti-polio campaigns are held, according to OCHA. Only 16.7
percent of the US $61 million required for emergency programmes in
2004 has been received.
Cote d'Ivoire's polio outbreak was "a reflection of the generally
precarious state of the health sector" in the northern and western
part of the country, the zones most affected by the crisis, OCHA
said. Ivorian health staff are yet to be redeployed -- in some cases
they have been absent since the crisis began 2 years ago -- and as
the various state structures responsible for provision of medicines
and other supplies are not in place.
Currently, local populations in rebel-held areas rely entirely upon
the many humanitarian organisations working within this domain, which
are running hospitals, health centres, and mobile health clinics in
these areas.
UNICEF continues to reinforce the capacities of the health sector and
train health staff on the management of medicines as part of their
programme to improve health care and ensure that children are
vaccinated properly. So far UNICEF has trained 36 administrative
staff, 22 doctors, 241 nurses and 439 health care assistants.

Polio: Nigeria, 22 Others Immunize 80m
Dec 2005 now target for eradication
------------------------
As the 4th round of National Immunization Days (NIDs) ends today
across the country, over 80 million children in 22 other countries of
sub-Saharan Africa including west and central Africa, would have been
immunized by an estimated one million vaccinators.
The synchronized immunization campaign, reputed to be the
largest-ever bid to beat polio, local and international health
workers in collaboration with traditional and religious leaders,
school teachers, parents, Rotary Club, and Red Cross members and
other volunteers, joined nurses and a vast array of other health
workers going house-to-house and village-to-village to ensure the
vaccine got to every child under the age of 5 years.
The campaign comes one month after an emergency meeting in Geneva
where health ministers of the 6 remaining polio-endemic countries --
Afghanistan, Egypt, India, Niger, Nigeria and Pakistan -- committed
themselves to end polio transmission in 2004 with a bold new plan for
the mass immunisation of a total of 250 million children.
Previously, before the campaign kicked of Friday last week, a total
of 786 polio cases had been reported globally in 2004 down from over
125 reported cases when the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI)
was launched in 1988 by WHO, Rotary International, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, and UNICEF. So far about US $3
billion has been expended on the initiative.
To date Nigeria tops the list with 597 cases compared with 178 cases
at about the same time in 2003. It is followed by India (62),
Pakistan (31), Niger (20), Afghanistan (3) and Egypt (1). Countries
with imported cases included Benin Republic (6 cases), Botswana (1),
Burkina Faso (6), Cameroon (2), the Central African Republic (12),
Chad (16), Cote d'Ivoire (15), Guinea (1), Mali (2) and the Sudan
(11).
Currently, the country accounts for about 77 per cent of the global
wild polio virus cases-count and 88 per cent of the cases in Africa
since January 2004. It is expected that with the latest NIDs,
transmission of the polio virus could stop completely by early 2005.
It is further believed that if the campaigns reach enough children in
the region's hotspots, polio transmission could be expected to slow
significantly.
The latest anti-polio drive is spearheaded by th World Health
organization and other partners in the Global Initiative -- Rotary
International, the United States Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and UNICEF.
In Lagos State, one of the 4 where the wild polio virus is confirmed
to still be circulating, an estimated 3 million children were
immunized. Speaking to Good Health Weekly shortly after the event
commenced, the state's Commissioner for Health, Dr. Leke Pitan said
about 120 000 personnel were mobilized for the activity. Armed with
500 000 doses of the OPV, the men and women who made up the 479 sweep
teams combed 400 000 homes to ensure that every child within the
target age was reached with the life-saving oral drops.
[Announcing the] recommendations of the Expert Review Committee on
polio Eradication, Pitan stressed that the new target date to
interrupt transmission of the polio virus had been extended till the
end of 2005 from the former December 2004 target date.
On attaining this objective, Pitan stressed, there would be intensive
activities for the next 12 months after the last detected wild polio
virus, and this is expected to go on right through 2006. A mop-up
exercise will follow in the first half of 2006, after which
certification processes will take off in 2007.
Nigeria's suspension of immunisation campaigns in key northern
states, particularly Kano, remains the greatest challenge for a quick
end to polio in Africa. Until mid-2003, Nigeria was part of Africa's
polio success story, with only a few northern states still endemic
with the virus and Lagos polio-free for over 2 years. The suspension
of immunisation campaigns in Kano and the subsequent outbreak of
polio in that area were fueled by unfounded rumours about the safety
of polio vaccine.
In recent months, polio has again spread across West and Central
Africa from Nigeria, paralysing children in 7 previously polio-free
countries -- most recently in the Central African Republic -- and
putting millions more at risk [see Polio Eradication report below
[5], the number of countries reinfected as a result of the ongoing
transmission in Nigeria is 10 - Mod.MPP]. But partners in the Global
Polio Eradication Initiative say that if upcoming campaigns over the
next several months reach every child, polio in Africa could be
stopped in its tracks already this year.

UNICEF Confirms Re-Emergence of Polio Virus
-------------------
UNICEF has confirmed the re-emergence [, as evidenced by] about 210
cases, of wild polio virus in some states under the zone D office of
the world body.
The communication officer of the Bauchi Zonal Office of UNICEF,
Alhaji Mohammed Anka announced this figure in Bauchi recently at a
forum of Directors of the National Orientation Agency (NOA) from 10
States within the zone.
The forum, at the instance of the Bauchi State office of the NOA with
support from UNICEF, discussed effective strategies for the
implementation of a new action plan for the eradication of wild
poliovirus in the most endemic states of the zone.
According to the UNICEF Spokesman, "Kano State has the highest rate
of wild polio virus with 127 assorted cases followed by Jigawa with
37; Bauchi 18; Borno 12 and Yobe 9", adding that Taraba, Plateau and
Nasarawa States have 2 cases each".
Anka warned politicians and religious leaders against toying with the
lives of innocent children through their unwarranted utterances that
lacked scientific proof, allegations difficult to substantiate.

New polio cases prompt enhanced immunisation campaign
-----------------------
11 confirmed cases of polio were reported in Sudan this year,
prompting 2 United Nations agencies and an international
non-governmental organisation to step up efforts to stem the spread
of the crippling and sometimes fatal disease, the UN Children's Fund
(UNICEF) said on Wednesday.
Most of the [viruses detected in samples taken from] cases were
genetically linked to the polio virus endemic in northern Nigeria,
UNICEF said in a statement. UNICEF was working with with the UN World
Health Organization (WHO) and Rotary International in the fight
against the spread of polio, it added.
Sudan had been polio-free since April 2001, but cross-border movement
between Chad and Sudan is believed to have re-introduced the virus.
The conflict in the western region of Darfur, where the 1st of the 11
cases was noticed, prevented the immunisation of all children under
the age of 5 years.
"Armed conflict has contributed to the re-infection by the wild polio
virus in Darfur that has now spread to the capital city, Khartoum,"
the WHO representative in Sudan, Guido Sabatinelli, said in the
statement.
The 1st of 2 rounds of national immunisation days was concluded on 12
Oct 2004. The 2nd round is scheduled for 21-23 Nov 2004, targeting 6
million children.
The campaigns are part of a larger, regional immunisation effort in
23 countries across west and central Africa that aims to immunize
more than 80 million children in a bid to urgently stop the spread of
the polio virus that originated in northern Nigeria.

[5] Africa vaccination campaigns

One million polio vaccinators, 80 million children, 25 countries:
Africa launches largest-ever immunization campaign
-------------------------------------------------
Africans unite across borders in massive effort to combat epidemic
and get polio eradication effort back on track
------------------------
More than one million polio vaccinators in 25 African countries today
embark on the continent's single-largest immunization campaign in
history, aiming to immunize 80 million children across sub-Saharan
Africa against polio over just 4 days. This massive effort is a
direct response to an ongoing polio epidemic in the region, which
risks paralysing thousands of children for life.
Tens of thousands of traditional and religious leaders, school
teachers, parents and Rotary club members will join nurses and a vast
array of other volunteers and health workers to systematically go
house-to-house and village-to-village, to hand-deliver the vaccine to
every child under the age of 5 years. To succeed, these vaccinators
-- many of them volunteers -- will need to cover half of the African
continent, an area larger than western Europe, travelling on foot,
horseback, bicycle, boat, car or whatever means possible.
Reaching every one of the 80 million children will present
vaccinators with tremendous challenges. For up to 12 hours every
day, many will battle stifling humidity, dusty environments,
temperatures upward of 40 C and in some places torrential downpours
at the end of the rainy season. Every immunization team will carry
iced vaccine carriers to maintain the polio vaccine until it is
administered to a child. Collectively, more than 100 million doses
of polio vaccine will be carried in the iced carriers, filled with
well over 3 million ice-packs.
Civil unrest in a number of the participating countries will
complicate access to children, particularly in parts of Cote
d'Ivoire, Liberia and the Sudan. The recent spread of polio in the
Darfur region of the Sudan and spread to Khartoum underscores the
speed with which the virus can re-infect communities, particularly
those which are displaced and isolated by conflict. In some areas,
such as in parts of Liberia, the polio vaccine has to be airlifted to
otherwise inaccessible parts of the country, putting a further strain
on already stretched financial, human and technical resources.
Across Africa the communication challenges will match the logistical
challenges. Once households are reached, many vaccinators will have
to alleviate parents' concerns regarding the safety of the polio
vaccine. Since mid-2003, unfounded rumours concerning vaccine
safety, originating in northern Nigeria, have been circulating
widely, leading to substantial confusion across the region,
particularly in the poorest communities where access to basic
healthcare is limited. To help reassure families, vaccinators have
been trained on the importance of re-assuring parents that polio
vaccination is safe and the only way to protect their children from
life-long disability caused by the poliovirus.
The eradication effort has united all levels of civil society in
Africa to collectively eradicate this disease. Traditional,
community and religious leaders throughout the region have pledged
their support. From the Emir of Kano and the Sultan of Sokoto in
Nigeria, to traditional chiefs in Burkina Faso and surrounding
countries -- all have expressed their intention to engage their full
constituencies to advocate for a polio-free Africa.
Smaller-scale activities held in 2000 and 2001 had previously stopped
polio in all countries in the region, except Nigeria and Niger. In
these 2 countries, immunization activities need to improve if polio
is to be stopped in Africa by the end of 2005.
But if the campaigns reach enough children in the region's hotspots,
polio transmission can be expected to slow significantly by the end
of 2004. In some countries where the virus has a weaker foothold,
transmission could stop completely by early 2005, epidemiologists
predict. The spearheading partners of the Global Polio Eradication
Initiative -- the World Health Organization (WHO), Rotary
International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and UNICEF -- stress that the benefits of these campaigns must
be underpinned by strong routine immunization services and
prioritising healthcare to the poorest communities, to provide the
best defence against the poliovirus.
This campaign was given a significant political boost on 2 Oct 2004
at an official presidential launch. H.E. Mr Olusegun Obasanjo,
President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Chairperson of the
African Union, Professor Alpha Oumar Konare, Chairperson of the
African Union Commission, and Jonathan Majiyagbe, past President of
Rotary International and long-time resident of Kano, added their
support at a launching celebration in Kano, Nigeria. As part of the
proceedings, President Obasanjo personally immunized the daughter of
the Governor of Kano.
A great deal is riding on the success of these campaigns, with a
global investment of over US $3 billion since 1988 for the
eradication effort, including more than US $500 million contributed
by Rotary International. An additional US $200 million is required
to implement similar cross-border polio immunization campaigns on 18
Nov 2004 and throughout 2005. If Africa can meet this challenge, it
will boost confidence in other public health and development
initiatives.
Notes to editors:
The ongoing polio outbreak originating in northern Nigeria occurred
due to a combination of factors, including the suspension of polio
campaigns in mid-2003 in Kano, Nigeria (due to unfounded concerns
regarding the safety of the oral polio vaccine), and low routine
immunization coverage in countries surrounding Nigeria. Polio
campaigns resumed in Kano on 31 Jul 2004.
The 25 countries participating in the polio campaign are: Benin,
Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad,
Congo-Brazzaville, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea,
Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, Niger, Sao Tome
and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo and Sudan. Start dates for
each respective national campaign vary -- 19 of the 25 countries'
campaigns will be conducted in October.
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is spearheaded by the World
Health Organization (WHO), Rotary International, the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and UNICEF. The poliovirus is
now endemic in only six countries, down from over 125 when the Global
Polio Eradication Initiative was launched in 1988.
The 6 remaining polio-endemic countries are: Nigeria, India,
Pakistan, Niger, Afghanistan and Egypt. As at 6 Oct 2004, this year
there have been 786 cases reported globally, in the following endemic
countries: Nigeria (597 cases), India (62), Pakistan (31), Niger
(20), Afghanistan (3), Egypt (1); and the following importation
countries: Benin (6), Botswana (1), Burkina Faso (6), Cameroon (2),
the Central African Republic (12), Chad (16), Cote d'Ivoire (15),
Guinea (1), Mali (2) and the Sudan (11).

[The 10 countries that have been re-infected with wild poliovirus
related to the ongoing transmission in Nigeria are Benin, Botwana,
Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Central African
Republic, Guinea, Mali, Sudan. As mentioned in earlier postings, the
ongoing polio transmission in Nigeria was a result of suspension of
vaccination activities in Kano State. One hopes that this issue has
now been resolved and with participation of Kano in the current
25-country vaccination campaign, interruption of transmission of the
wild poliovirus in Africa will be achieved. - Mod.MPP]
