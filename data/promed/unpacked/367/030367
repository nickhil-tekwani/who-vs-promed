In the Riverina (about 100 km north of the Goulburn Valley) we see
most of our cases [of anthrax in late summer/early autumn. The
Riverina is the south-central part of NSW on the Victorian border
between the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers and west of the Great
Dividing Range. It is the part of the world that I call home. The
Goulburn River runs into the Murray just on the Victorian side from
the Riverina. We are a little hotter and a bit drier than them, but
it is pretty close.
Our weather was warm for the first half of April 2002 (about 30 deg
C) with a few light showers on 11-14th. This is what I would expect
before an anthrax incident. I don't think it would have been much
different at Tatura.

[ProMED-mail does not customarily get into intense epidemiological
discussions, so this thread on the recent cases in Victoria and claim
of the latter's year-round incidence in contradistinction to NSW must
be cut (reluctantly). However, I am still puzzled, as anthrax in
grazing animals is normally seasonal. - Mod.MHJ
