Taiwan on Wednesday confirmed a fresh outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) among sheep in the southern county of Changhua and ordered the
destruction of all 228 infected sheep to prevent the disease from spreading.
The cabinet's Council of Agriculture said the farm owners reported on
Monday 22 newly-born sheep had died after being infected with the deadly
disease.
All cloven-hoofed animals are vulnerable to FMD but it was the first
reported outbreak among sheep in Taiwan, the council said. The council
ordered an island wide vaccination of cloven-hoofed animals. "Only when we
conduct a thorough vaccination of animals can we stop further spreading of
the disease," council chairman Ling Shiang-nung told reporters.
In January, the council slaughtered 134 cattle suspected of being infected.
Taiwan ordered a vaccination of livestock following a 1997 outbreak that
ravaged the island's feedlots, but isolated cases of infection have been
reported periodically.
Taiwan's feedlots were devastated in 1997 by an island wide outbreak of
FMD, forcing farmers to destroy a quarter of the island's 14 million hogs
and crippling what up to then was a US 1.6 billion-a-year pork export
industry.
