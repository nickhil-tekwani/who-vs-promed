A 3rd case of meningococcal [serogroup] C has occurred in Sarlat in 3 weeks. This time it is a municipal officer in the city of Sarlat. She was admitted to hospital in Perigueux on Friday [22 Nov 2013]. 3 of her close colleagues have received preventive treatment. The Institute for Public Health Surveillance will investigate why these 3 cases have occurred in such close proximity.

The 1st case was a 19-year-old girl in the canton of Saint Cyprien, next a young child, in Sarlat; and now a Sarlat commune employee on Thursday [21 Nov 2013]. The Institute for Public Health Surveillance acknowledges that Dordogne is facing an unusual situation.

This department [Dordogne] usually sees between 1 and 5 cases per year, but according to Patrick Rolland, the head of the intelligence unit of the INVS [Institut de veille sanitaire (Institute for Public Health Surveillance)], there is no reason to worry.

First, because the disease can only be transmitted after close contact, through coughing or even saliva. Second, [meningococcal disease is vaccine-preventable. Immunization against meningococcus serogroup C disease has been recommended in France since 2009 (infants from 12 to 24 months of age, and catch up vaccination up to 25 years of age) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23428390)].

[The news report above describes the occurrence of 2 cases of meningococcal disease due to serogroup C in Sarlat and 1 case in nearby Saint Cyprien (20 km/12.4 mi apart) in the department of Dordogne, France. The commune of Sarlat has a population of about 9300 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarlat-la-Can√©da) and the canton of Saint Cyprien, about 6500 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Saint-Cyprien). Perigueux is the capital of the Dordogne Department in the region of Aquitaine in southwestern France.

Immunization against meningococcus C has been recommended in France since 2009 (infants from 12 to 24 months of age, and catch up vaccination up to 25 years of age). 2 years after the Ministry of Health's decision to reimburse this vaccine, a survey found that only 21.3 percent of teenagers and 32.3 percent of infants during the 2nd year of life had been vaccinated (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23428390).

In a community outbreak of meningococcal disease, the cases should reside in the same geographic area, but are not close contacts of each other and do not share a common affiliation and the population at risk is the community population, which is used as the denominator in calculations of the disease attack rate (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm).

There are 3 patients with meningococcal disease in the department of Dordogne (population of about 406 000) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dordogne). The primary attack rate in this community is thus about 0.7 cases per 100 000, which does not meet the CDC definition of an outbreak of meningococcal disease, which is the occurrence of 3 or more confirmed or probable cases during a period of up to 3 months, resulting in a primary disease attack rate in the population at risk of at least 10 cases per 100 000 persons (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm).

However, we are not told if the 3 cases are linked by association to the same organization or grouping, in which case the population at risk could be much smaller and the attack rate higher.
