Madhya Pradesh [MP] government has banned transportation of bovines, their sale and mingling in animal fairs, and mating without a test for the next 2 months as a viral disease -- lumpy skin disease -- has affected at least 15 000 such animals in at least 10 districts of the state bordering Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. Measures are being taken to contain the spread of the disease, government officials said.

The animal husbandry department and Nanaji Deshmukh Veterinary Science University, Jabalpur, has ordered isolation of infected bovines for 12-14 days and also put a ban on their inter-state and intra-state transportation, as per officials.

Animal husbandry department's additional chief secretary, JN Kansotia, said, "Spread of the virus was limited to some districts, but we have issued instructions to district officers of animal husbandry department of all the districts to contain the disease."

Nanaji Deshmukh Veterinary Science University, Jabalpur, dean RK Sharma said, "The disease is spreading very fast due to 4 main factors: contact, secretion of dung and urine, flies, and mating with affected bovines. Isolation and proper medication are the only ways to contain the disease."

"The 1st case was reported in Anuppur in the 2nd week of August [2020] when some cows showed the symptoms of the viral disease," said PK Solnaki, a senior veterinary surgeon of animal husbandry department, appointed as nodal officer for disease containment efforts. "The tested samples from Anuppur confirmed the presence of the virus from family Poxviridae, which causes lumpy skin disease."

"In just one week, we came to know that it had spread to at least 6 districts. In less than one month, it spread to more than 10 districts and affected over 15 000 cattle, mainly domestic. The worst-affected district is Balaghat, where 8700 cases were reported," said Solanki.

"The local municipal bodies and panchayat officials of all 52 districts have been asked to remain on alert and ensure isolation of stray cows if found infected. Owners of bovines have been asked to make a separate shed for infected ones and not leave the infected ones for grazing in an open ground," said the officer.

Solanki says that the ban on organising animal fairs, which were on hold due to COVID-19, will continue for the next 2 months. The bovine owners have also been asked to mate their animals only after testing.

To create awareness among people and to provide medicines to infected bovines, camps are being organized in more than 500 villages of 10 districts of east and southeast of MP, said JN Kansotia.

"The disease has a very rare chance of mortality, but the morbidity rate is very high," said RK Sharma, dean of the university. "It causes secretion of milk in affected cows and buffalos. There is no report of transmission of the disease from animals to humans so far."

[India submitted its immediate OIE notification on 18 Nov 2019 to announce its 1st lumpy skin disease [LSD] event, which reportedly started 12 Aug 2019 in the northeastern state of Odisha (also known as Orissa). Since then, the disease has spread to at least 10 additional states throughout India, namely Assam, Bihar, Kerala, Jharkand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and West Bengal. This extensive spread covering vast parts of the Indian subcontinent is yet to be officially reported to the OIE. Vaccination is being applied.

LSD, a non-zoonotic capripox disease of cattle, was, in the 20th century, known to circulate mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, with sporadic introductions into Near Eastern countries. In 2015, the virus extended its spread, causing outbreaks in Greece and Caucasian Russia. In 2016, the disease extended its domains northwards, westwards, and eastwards, entering the entire Balkan area (Macedonia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Albania, and Romania), further within the Russian territories in eastern Europe, western Asia, and eastwards to Kazakhstan. Since 2016, LSD continued its extension, in 2019 reaching China, India, Bangladesh, and Kyrgyzstan, where its circulation has been informed by reliable sources and described in media reports including photographic evidence (https://tinyurl.com/y5tf6bxe, October 2019, and https://elgezit.kg/ky/2020/08/15/160360/, 15 Aug 2020). During 2020, LSD has entered Taiwan and Nepal.

Taiwan's authorities notified the OIE on 14 Sep 2020 about 14 additional LSD outbreaks in Kinmen County, an island adjacent to China mainland (see, with map, at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=35667). Since 10 Jul 2020, when LSD was first reported in Taiwan, a total of 34 outbreaks have been confirmed, with a total of 154 cases and 226 animals culled.

Another new LSD outbreak in a location bordering China's mainland is Khabarovsk, in Russia's far-east province Altai. This outbreak was reported to the OIE on 3 Sep 2020; it had started 25 Aug 2020. The measures applied in the Altai province, as updated 17 Sep 2020, are described in the province's website, available at https://tinyurl.com/y2lyqsqw (in Russian). The LSD situation in China is likely to be under-reported.

OIE's global LSD map, presenting all outbreaks reported since January 2016, is available at https://tinyurl.com/y2k2m6df (click on the relevant cluster to center, zoom in to the required resolution).
