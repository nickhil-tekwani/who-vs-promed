I think the Argentine die-off mentioned in a recent ProMED post is
the same one I was contacted about; see below. It sounds like
botulism. We are sending out specific antiserum today [6 Feb 2006?]
to determine whether it is type C or not.

[Re. ProMED post Undiagnosed die-off, avian - Argentina (02) -- see ref. below]
-----------------------------------------------
I think that die-off is the same. I don't have knowledge of another
one. The die-off that I refer [to] occurred in La Pampa province
(central), involving 500 birds of different species (_Anas platalea_,
_Platalea ajaja_, _Podiceps occipitalis_, _Anas flavirostris_ &
_Himantopus melanurus_), however, 90 percent of them were _Anas
platalea_.
We did serum inoculation in mice with serum samples from all of these
species, and all mice had characteristic symptoms (wasp waist,
labored breathing) and died after intra-peritoneal inoculation
between 5 and 48 hours later. We also found 7 dead chickens in a hen
house that was 500 meters from the small lake where most of the birds
died. The serum of these chickens also had botulinum toxins. The
chickens had access to a putrid aquatic bird, and after eating
maggots, died. We also prepared suspensions with 4-5 maggots from
this bird and others, and after filtering through a filter of 0.25 u,
we did mouse inoculation, and most of the mice died too.

[Avian botulism, or Western duck sickness, is a paralytic disease
caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium
botulinum_. This bacteria is widespread in soil and requires warm
temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen)
environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing
vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can
provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and
produce toxin. A wide variety of birds and some species of mammals
are susceptible to the disease.
