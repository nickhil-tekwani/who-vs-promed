Since the beginning of 2022, 5 cases of leptospirosis have been detected in the Khmelnytskyi region: 2 of them among migrants.

This was reported by Public News with reference to the infectious disease doctor of the Khmelnytskyi City Infectious Diseases Hospital Elena Markevich. According to the doctor, there are currently 3 patients diagnosed with leptospirosis in the medical facility; 2 cases were recorded among internally displaced persons.

"The condition is moderate. Some will recover. One patient was discharged recently. There was also a case where the patient had both leptospirosis and a coronavirus infection. In 2021, during this 3-month period [January, February, and March 2021], there was one case in the city of Khmelnytskyi, and up to 3 cases in the region. Infectious diseases proceed in waves: one year there are fewer of them, one year there are more of them," says the infectious diseases specialist.

According to the Center for Public Health of the Ministry of Health, leptospirosis is a dangerous zoonotic (common to animals and humans) infectious disease. Symptoms range from mild (headaches, fever, muscle aches, red eyes, diarrhea, rash) to serious (kidney, liver, meningitis) and even fatal (when seeking care and treatment are delayed).

Sources of causative agents of leptospirosis are infected animals - mainly small mammals (murine and waterfowl [?] rodents). The disease is not transmitted from person to person.
