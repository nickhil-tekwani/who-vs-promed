Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Singapore, Singapore
Date of start of the outbreak: 28 May 2019
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Not applicable
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Dogs / 3 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: A 3-year-old female entire French bulldog (imported from another country) showed clinical signs of weight loss despite a normal appetite, non-pruritic alopecia on the head, enlarged lymph nodes, anaemia and proteinuria. Dog was diagnosed with leishmaniosis and is currently undergoing treatment with allopurinol. There are no other dogs in the household, but the dog has possible contact with 2 other dogs.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Dogs / 33.33 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Legal movement of animals
Epidemiological comments: A 3-year-old female entire French bulldog imported from another country showed clinical signs of weight loss despite a normal appetite, non-pruritic alopecia on the head, enlarged lymph nodes, anaemia and proteinuria. Dog was diagnosed with leishmaniosis and is currently undergoing treatment with allopurinol. There are no other dogs in the household, but the dog has possible contact with 2 other dogs. The owner was advised to continue treatment and take precautionary measures (vector control measures, segregation from other dogs, avoid contact with immunocompromised individuals, etc.)

Control measures
Measures applied: Screening, traceability, control of vectors, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), treatment of affected animals (allopurinol)
Measures to be applied: No other measures

["Leishmaniasis is an important complex of protozoal vector-borne diseases that affects both humans and animals. It can be caused by many species of _Leishmania_. A few of these organisms are primarily maintained in humans, but most circulate mainly in animals. Most of the latter organisms are zoonotic. Leishmaniasis is transmitted by sandflies and can be difficult to prevent, and some of the drugs used for treatment have significant side effects or limited availability outside endemic regions.

"In humans, leishmaniasis has 3 general forms -- cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral -- and different species of _Leishmania_ tend to cause each type. Cutaneous leishmaniasis, a form that typically remains limited to the skin, can be caused by numerous organisms. A few species of _Leishmania_ regularly affect the mucous membranes, as well as the skin. Both cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis may result in disfigurement, but mucosal involvement is generally more serious. Two organisms, _L. donovani_ and _L. infantum_, cause most cases of visceral leishmaniasis, the most serious form. Visceral leishmaniasis is characterized by damage to the internal organs, and fully symptomatic cases are considered life-threatening.

"_Leishmania_ can also cause skin and mucosal lesions and/or visceral signs in animals. Most species of _Leishmania_ are maintained in wildlife, often without clinical signs, but dogs are an important reservoir host for _L. infantum_. Dogs are also the domesticated animal most often affected by leishmaniasis. Clinical cases in this species can be life-threatening, and may be difficult to treat. Cases of leishmaniasis are also seen occasionally in guinea pigs, cats, equids, and captive or free-living wild species. Ruminant livestock are rarely affected.

"Treatment [in animals] can produce clinical improvement, especially in mild to moderate cases. However, it may not eliminate the parasite and relapses are possible. Pentavalent antimonials are often used where they are available. Outside endemic regions, these drugs can sometimes be obtained from government agencies or other sources. In the USA, they are provided through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Other drugs used in humans (e.g., miltefosine, allopurinol, amphotericin B) can also be employed (provided the animal species is not unusually susceptible to the agent's side effects). Allopurinol has been used as a maintenance drug to prevent relapses, but prolonged or indefinite treatment may be required. Drug-resistant _Leishmania_ are common in some areas."
