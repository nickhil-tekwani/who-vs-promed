[1] Vaccine protection against variants

New UK government research suggests 2 doses of a Covid-19 vaccine are needed to provide strong protection against symptomatic infection from the coronavirus variant 1st identified in India, according to 2 people briefed on the preliminary data. Two vaccine doses provided 81 per cent protection against the B.1.617.2 variant found in India, and 87 per cent against the B.1.1.7 strain 1st identified in Kent in south-east England, according to the Public Health England data that was presented to a meeting of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag).

Two people who attended the Nervtag meeting said the data showed that one dose offered 33 per cent protection against symptomatic infection from B.1.617.2, and 51 per cent against B.1.1.7. This suggests a single shot offers 35 per cent less protection against B.1.617.2 compared with B.1.1.7, according to Financial Times analysis.

The PHE figures aggregate data from the BioNTech/Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs.

The rapid spread of B.1.617.2 in pockets of England has cast doubt on the country's road map out of lockdown, with the next phase due to take place on 21 [May 2021].

A pair of models by Neil Ferguson, a leading epidemiologist from Imperial College London, presented at the Nervtag meeting on Fri 21 May 2021 supported the new PHE research, with one suggesting that a single vaccine dose was about 50 per cent less effective against B.1.617.2 compared with B.1.1.7, and the other showing a 20 per cent reduction.

The figures for reduced efficacy compare favourably to estimates for the B.1.351 variant 1st detected in South Africa, where a single dose of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine was found to offer only 17 per cent protection against confirmed infection with Covid-19, rising to 75 per cent after 2 doses.

UK scientists have been racing to work out how much more transmissible B.1.617.2 is than other variants in circulation, most notably B.1.1.7. Modelling released last week by government advisers suggested it could be about 50 per cent more transmissible than B.1.1.7

Current Covid shots provide a high level of protection against hospitalization and death, according to a summary of the efficacy of 8 vaccines that showed the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE jab may be better at stopping at least 2 worrisome coronavirus variants.

Efficacy against Covid-linked disease averaged about 85% after a full course, rising to almost 100% protection against severe disease, hospitalization or death, Julia Shapiro, Natalie Dean, Ira Longini and colleagues said in a paper released Fri [21 May 2021] before peer-review and publication. The University of Florida researchers compared data from journal articles and media reports for products that have gone through double-blind, placebo-controlled, late-stage vaccine trials, as well as observational studies.

"These estimates should be useful for constructing mathematical models for vaccination impact and for making policy decisions involving vaccination," they said. They plan to update their research, which received funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health, as more information becomes available.

The unprecedented speed with which safe and effective vaccines have been developed and rolled out across the world have enabled many economies to reopen, paving the way for a recovery from the worst pandemic in a century. Still, uncontrolled spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus risks spawning new variants that may undermine the potency of these immunizations.

Protection against any disease with infection for 3 so-called variants of concern averaged 86% for the B.1.1.7 strain 1st detected in the U.K., 61% for the P.1 strain that drove an explosive outbreak in Brazil, and 56% for the B.1.351 strain discovered in South Africa, the University of Florida researchers said.

Vaccine efficacy was estimated for immunizations that are being rolled out on local and global scales, they said. These include the Pfizer, Moderna Inc., Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca Plc, Sputnik, Novavax Inc., Sinovac Biotech Ltd., and Sinopharm Group Co. products.

"Some of the estimates are based on rigorous, preplanned statistical analyses from double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, while others are extracted from observational studies with different levels of control," the researchers said.

Vaccine efficacy to prevent any Covid-caused disease after 2 doses is summarized below:

Vaccine: % efficacy (% Range)
------------------------
Moderna: 94.5 (86.5-97.8)
Pfizer: 94.2 (88.7-97.2)
Novavax: 89.3 (75.2-95.4)
AstraZeneca: 81.5 (67.9-89.4)
Sinopharm: 78.1 (64.9-86.3)
Sinovac: 50.7 (35.7-62.2)

The researchers found vaccine efficacy against infectiousness was 54%, on average, indicating that immunization reduces the direct transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to others by 54%.

Data for 4 vaccines are summarized below.

Vaccine: % against infectiousness
---------------------
Pfizer: 94.0
Moderna: 80.0
Johnson & Johnson: 65.5
AstraZeneca: 50.0

Estimates for vaccine efficacy for 3 variants of concern are summarized. The researchers found B.1.1.7 led to "somewhat reduced" efficacy compared with the "wild type" strain. In contrast, the P.1 and B.1.351 variants led to considerably lower vaccine efficacy, owing to mutations that affect immune function.

B.1.1.7 variant (U.K.)
Vaccine: % Efficacy
----------------
Pfizer: 89.5
Novavax: 85.6
AstraZeneca: 74.6

P.1 variant (Brazil)
Vaccine: % Efficacy
---------------
Johnson & Johnson: 66.2
Sinovac: 49.6

B.1.351 variant (South Africa)
Vaccine: % Efficacy
---------------
Pfizer: 75.0

Novavax: 49.4
AstraZeneca: 21.9

Dozens of climbers and staff on Mount Everest have tested positive for coronavirus following an outbreak of the virus on the world's highest summit, reports claim.

Lukas Furtenbach, an expert climbing guide from Austria, has estimated there could be upwards of 100 active cases of Covid-19 at Everest's South Base Camp in Nepal.

However, Nepalese officials have denied this is the case, insisting that there has not been an outbreak at the site where some 1500 people are currently located.

They instead blamed any symptoms on other illnesses such as altitude sickness.

Mr Furtenbach, who is the only prominent guide to have axed his expedition due to virus fears, says one of his foreign guides and 6 Nepali Sherpas tested positive.

He estimated there are "at least 100 people, minimum" who are positive for Covid in South Base Camp, adding: "The numbers might be something like 150 or 200."

Elsewhere, it was reported some 77 Sherpas have tested positive for the virus, according to local health section coordinator Artimaya Tamang.

Speaking from Kathmandu, Mr Furtenbach said: "I think with all the confirmed cases we know now -- confirmed from [rescue] pilots, from insurance, from doctors, from expedition leaders -- I have the positive tests, so we can prove this."

He said it was obvious there were many cases at the Everest Base Camp because he could visibly see people who were sick and hear people coughing in their tents.

Mr Furtenbach runs Furtenbach Adventures, which boasts a 100 per cent success rate on Everest and 20 years of expedition experience on the mountain.

A total of 408 foreign climbers were issued permits to climb Everest this season, aided by several hundred Sherpa guides and support staff who have been stationed at base camp since April [2021].

Officials earlier denied there are any active cases among climbers and support staff this season at all base camps for the country's Himalayan mountains.

Other climbing teams have not confirmed any Covid-19 infections among their members or staff.

However, several climbers have reported testing positive for the virus after they were brought down from Everest South Base Camp.

Mr Furtenbach stressed that most teams on the mountain were not carrying testing kits, adding that his team had helped conduct tests and confirmed 2 cases ahead of returning home.

Most teams are reportedly still at Base Camp, hoping for clear weather so they can make a final push to the summit before climbing season ends next month [June 2021].

Last month [April 2021], a Norwegian climber became the 1st to test positive at the camp. He was flown by helicopter to Kathmandu, where it was confirmed he contracted Covid-19. He later returned home.

Nepal is currently experiencing a surge in cases, with 8607 new infections and 177 deaths reported on Fri 21 May 2021. This brings the nation's totals to 497 000 cases and 6024 deaths.

China last week cancelled climbing from its side of Mount Everest due to fears the virus could be spread from the Nepalese side.

Earlier this month [May 2021], Nepal made an urgent plea for 1.6 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses as the infection rate soared.

"People who have already gotten the 1st dose will be in difficulty if they don't receive their 2nd dose within the stipulated time," said Samir Adhikari, a senior official.

Nepal, between China and India, has already vaccinated more than 2 million people with the AstraZeneca vaccine provided by India and China's Sinopharm. But authorities were forced to suspend the vaccination programme in April 2021 after the country failed to secure fresh dispatches of vaccine.

"I would like to request our neighbours, friendly countries and international organisations to help us with vaccines and critical care medicines to support ongoing efforts to combat the pandemic," Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli said.

Complacency, populism, and poor infrastructure fueled a devastating 2nd wave of Covid-19 in India, a disaster that has infected millions and wrought havoc well beyond its borders thanks to a new, more contagious variant. But none of those failings are unique to the country.

So why are we not paying more attention to surges elsewhere in the neighborhood, in places no better equipped to contain a spike or track new mutations?

Alarm bells should be ringing across Southeast Asia. It's bad enough in Thailand, Malaysia, and even, to a more modest degree, Viet Nam, all hitting record daily cases far worse than in earlier waves. Indonesia is edging toward 6000 new daily infections, and the Philippines on Saturday [22 May 2021] announced over 6800. It's too early to know whether that's just a blip in a recent downward trend or something more serious.

But a bigger concern should be the region's poorer corners that, until now, had escaped the worst. Cambodia saw a surge so severe last month [April 2021] that leader Hun Sen said his country was "on the brink of death." New infections have eased, but overall case numbers are now well over 24 000, from a 10th of that in early April 2021. Laos had a total of less than 50 cases at the start of April 2021, but official figures are now at more than 1700. In Myanmar, it's hard to even know the extent of the spread, given that testing virtually dried up after a military coup in February 2021.

It's all coming at a time when economies and households are weakened by the consequences of more than a year of virus restrictions, and few governments are eager to repeat 2020 lockdowns. Vaccine rollouts are slow and borders porous, with cases already turning up in China. Laos has roughly 5000 km, some 3100 miles, of frontiers with 5 neighbors, and early cases in this wave involved people crossing the Mekong River from Thailand.

Then there are wealthier countries, like Singapore and Taiwan, that had been seen as havens for their success in controlling the virus and are now grappling with outbreaks and imposing tighter restrictions. Japan is an unmitigated Covid-19 mess, with a fresh wave of cases, one of the lowest vaccination rates among affluent nations, and a looming Olympic Games opposed by more than 80% of the population.

Asia isn't alone. South American authorities are struggling with new waves and a worrying variant, this time coming out of Brazil, where a president who scoffs at the disease has left hospitals struggling. But it's a striking example -- and not the 1st in this pandemic -- of how we keep repeating the same mistakes.

Two clear lessons need to be taken on board. The 1st, simply, is that there's no way of controlling the coronavirus without vaccines. It's the reason parts of Europe and the United States are now seeing lower numbers and discussing summer holiday plans. Thailand, by contrast, wants to reopen the tourist island of Phuket but has fully vaccinated just over one % of its population and is seeing prison outbreaks so severe it's contemplating pardons.

A low vaccination rate left Taiwan exposed when cases broke through its defenses, and it's a similar story in Singapore, where more citizens are immunized, just not enough of them.

Both are now scrambling. The Lion City, forced to cancel high-profile events like the World Economic Forum, is rushing to give all adults a 1st shot by the end of August 2021 and will lengthen time between doses to cover more people.

That should be a warning to places where local cases are currently under control but where vaccination rates remain anemic. Less than 12% of Hong Kong's population has had both doses.

Australia has moved at such a leisurely pace -- "a marathon and not a sprint" -- that enough doses have been given to cover just 7% of the population. Both should be doing far more to prepare.

And there's a 2nd, vital lesson from India, and indeed Brazil. That's the cost to the wider world of allowing hotspots to develop unmonitored, with insufficient testing, tracking, and genome-sequencing abilities, which allow health authorities to keep up with the evolution of the virus and act accordingly.

Their absence leaves everyone flying blind. Consider Myanmar, already one of the worst-hit and least-prepared countries in Southeast Asia, with threadbare hospitals and just 0.7 intensive care beds and 0.5 ventilators per 100 000 people. India, by comparison, had a little over 2 beds, and South Korea nearly 11. None of that was helped by the military takeover, and doctors and nurses have been at the forefront of civil disobedience. Testing has fallen to a daily average of fewer than 1000 samples from a paltry 18 000 before the coup.

There is little hope for mass vaccination.

Variants must be caught before they explode, and we can't afford to overlook what's happening now across the region. The double mutant variant seen in India was around in December 2020 but progressed unchecked. More are bound to emerge at this phase of the pandemic. That means urgent outside support and attention. It isn't, yet, all over.

[It's important to vaccinate the populations of all countries, especially the poorer ones. So long as Sars-CoV-2 is circulating anywhere in the world, mutations will continue to occur, some of which may have a selective advantage. With only one % of the population of Phuket, Thailand vaccinated, the naive population presents a high risk, not only to themselves, but globally. - Mod.LK]
