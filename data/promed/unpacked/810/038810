C. Other epidemiological details:
- The results of 2 rounds of area testing indicate that the virus has not
spread either to other establishments within the same enterprise or to
other production facilities in the state of Connecticut and surrounding states.
- A pilot program of sequential depopulation to eradicate the H7 virus will
be conducted based on the vaccination of recovered hens and of replacement
pullets prior to placement on the affected establishment.
- Strict biosecurity measures will be followed to ensure virus containment,
and monitoring will be conducted to detect any mutation of the virus.
Control measures:
- Quarantine and movement control.
- USDA-APHIS is working closely with the state of Connecticut to conduct
epidemiological investigations, tracebacks, and area surveillance testing.
