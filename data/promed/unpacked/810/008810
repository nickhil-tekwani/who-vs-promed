Ebola death toll in 3 African countries hits 7373: WHO
------------------------------------------------------
The death toll from Ebola in the 3 worst affected countries in West Africa has risen to 7373 among 19 031 cases known to date there, the World Health Organization said on Sat 20 Dec 2014.

The latest data, posted overnight on the WHO website, reflected nearly 500 new deaths from the worst ever outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since previous WHO figures were issued on 17 Dec 2014.

Sierra Leone accounts for the most cases, 8759, against 7819 for Liberia. But Sierra Leone's death toll of 2477 is far less than 3346 recorded in Liberia, leading some experts to question the credibility of the figures reported by Freetown [Sierra Leone]... -- more

[The WHO reference is:
Latest available situation summary, 19 Dec 2014
http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.ebola-sitrep.ebola-summary-latest?lang=en
Footnotes explain that the figures are as of
- 14 Dec 2014 for Liberia,
- 16 Dec 2014 for Guinea, and
- 17 Dec 2014 for Sierra Leone; and that
- separate cumulative totals for confirmed, probable, and suspected deaths for Liberia are not available (that is, only total deaths are shown).
- cases and deaths outside the 3 countries are not included.

The previous WHO update dated 17 Dec 2014 stated:
"A total of 18 569 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD and 6900 deaths have been reported up to the end of;
- 14 Dec 2014 by the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Sierra Leone, and
- 9 Dec 2014 by the Ministry of Health of Liberia."
So this is an increase of 462 cases & 473 deaths (not all confirmed) in less than 3 full days.

It's getting quite difficult to calculate the total daily increases per country, let alone overall -- and WHO recognizes that all these figures are highly suspect. A lot of time and talent is being put into analyzing them, but it is questionable whether the results are any use. I used to think that as long as case and death figures were consistently wrong, one could derive trends -- but reporting criteria, lags & case finding have varied so much over time, both between and within the 3 countries, as to render detailed trends invalid -- other than the fact that cases are increasing dramatically. - Mod.JW
