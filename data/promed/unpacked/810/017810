A laboratory testing has confirmed the 8th horse infected with Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus this year [2019], the Massachusetts Department of Public Health said. The horse was stabled in Spencer in Worcester County, a community already considered at high risk for EEE, health officials said.

No change in risk levels is indicated. There are 35 communities now at critical risk, 53 at high risk, and 121 at moderate risk for the EEE virus in Massachusetts.

There have been 12 human cases of EEE this season in Massachusetts and 9 confirmed cases of EEE this year [2019] in animals -- 8 horses and a goat. State officials continue to remind residents throughout the commonwealth to take personal precautions to prevent mosquito bites.

EEE is a rare but serious and potentially fatal disease capable of affecting people of all ages. EEE occurs sporadically in Massachusetts, with the most recent outbreak years occurring from 2004 to 2006 and 2010 to 2012. There were 22 human cases of EEE infection during those 2 outbreaks.

EEE virus has been found in 426 mosquito samples this year [2019], many of them from species of mosquitoes capable of spreading the virus to people. An additional 76 mosquitos have tested positive for WNV [West Nile virus].

Another animal case of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has been confirmed in Michigan. A horse in St. Joseph 1st showed signs of the mosquito-borne illness [23 Sep 2019] the Department of Health and Human Services said.

EEE has been confirmed in 9 people in Michigan in Barry, Berrien, Calhoun, Cass, Kalamazoo and Van Buren counties. Four Michigan residents have died from EEE. Animals from Allegan, Barry, Berrien, Calhoun, Cass, Genesee, Jackson, Kalamazoo, Kent, Lapeer, Livingston, Montcalm, Newaygo, St. Joseph and Van Buren counties have also had EEE.

More than 328 000 acres of land have been treated with insecticide to help combat the outbreak.

EEE is a disease caused by a virus spread from infected mosquitos causing inflammation of the brain. Viruses spread by mosquitos are referred to as arboviruses. West Nile is another kind of arbovirus. EEE virus is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. Transmission does not occur directly from person to person. Only about 4% or 5% of human EEE virus infections result in EEE.

It takes 4 to 10 days after the bite from an infected mosquito to develop symptoms of EEE (in people). Symptoms include sudden onset of fever, chills, body and joint aches, severe encephalitis, headache, disorientation, tremors, seizures, and possibly paralysis. People who experience symptoms are urged to see a doctor as soon as possible. Those infected could get permanent brain damage, go into a coma, or die.

The virus is built up in a particular area through an amplification cycle:
- Infected mosquitos feed on birds, infecting them in the process.
- Infected mosquitos then feed on infected birds and become infected themselves.

EEE is typically found along the East Coast and Gulf Coast, along with the Great Lakes region. Once an area has a hard frost, mosquito activity dies down and the virus goes dormant until spring.

A vaccine has been developed for horses, but no human vaccine is available. In the USA, an average of 7 human cases of EEE are reported annually. The disease kills one-third of patients and leaves 80% of survivors with mild to severe brain damage.

As of Sunday [29 Sep 2019], EEE was confirmed in 9 people and 3 have died in the following 6 counties: Barry, Berrien, Calhoun, Cass, Kalamazoo and Van Buren [the 4th death was reported 2 Oct 2019]. Cases have also been confirmed in 30 animals from the following 15 counties: Allegan, Barry, Berrien, Calhoun, Cass, Genesee, Jackson, Kalamazoo, Kent, Lapeer, Livingston, Montcalm, Newaygo, St. Joseph and Van Buren.

Aerial treatments for several counties were scheduled for Sunday night [29 Sep 2019], but were postponed due to weather. Areas of Berrien, Cass, St. Joseph and Van Buren counties were set for treatment Monday night. A small part of northern Washtenaw County will also be treated. Aerial spraying is used to control and reduce the number of mosquitos and reduce the chances for a virus to spread. Airplanes spray very low volumes of adulticide or larvicide in areas where mosquitos are spreading viruses. Larvicides kill larvae that hatch from eggs within 1 to 4 days. Adulticides kill adult mosquitos immediately.

How to protect yourself from EEE:
- Apply insect repellents.
- Wear long-sleeved shirts.
- Use window and door screens.
- Eliminate mosquito breeding sites by emptying water from buckets, kiddie pools and tires.

In all, [4] have died in Michigan, 3 in Massachusetts, 2 in Connecticut and 1 in Rhode Island. Michigan's EEE outbreak is its worst in more than a decade. Massachusetts, with 12 cases, is seeing its worst outbreak since 1956. Aerial sprays have taken place a record 6 times this year [2019] in Massachusetts.

"It looks like 2019 is clearly the beginning of our next outbreak," said Catherine Brown of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Brown believes EEE virus is more widespread this year. Brown says outbreaks are often caused by a new strain being introduced to a region. She believes a new strain of EEE virus came to the Northeast from birds migrating from Florida.

State health officials announced Friday [4 Oct 2019] the potentially deadly virus Eastern equine encephalitis or EEE has now been found in Luzerne County. The State Health Department says a horse in Fairmount Township died from the mosquito-borne disease this week.

Cases of EEE have already been reported in Carbon and Monroe counties. Those cases were in animals as well. EEE is carried by birds and when mosquitoes bite the birds, they can then transmit the disease.

So far 11 people have died from EEE this year [2019], but none of the victims were from Pennsylvania. Experts say it is the worst outbreak of EEE in decades.

[Protecting yourself from mosquitoes with proper clothing (long sleeves, long pants), avoiding dusk and dawn -- times mosquitoes may be most active -- and using mosquito repellents is important, regardless of where you are.

Mosquitoes carry a number of diseases with EEE being one. West Nile virus is another. There are others beyond the scope of this particular posting.

Remember to protect your pets as well. Vaccinate your horses against EEE, WNV and WEE. Usually tetanus is included with this vaccine, and this combination vaccine requires a series of 2 shots approximately 3 weeks apart, and annually thereafter. However, if you are in an area having an outbreak, the EEE vaccine wanes quickly and revaccination every 3 months is recommended.

Also use mosquito and fly spray approved for horses on your equine friends for further protection and relief from these biting pests. - Mod.TG
