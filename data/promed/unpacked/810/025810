CRIMEAN-CONGO HEMORRHAGIC FEVER - KOSOVO

A patient suffering from Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever died Tuesday
evening [8 Jun 2010] at the infectious disease clinic in Pristina
hospital, the 4th person in Kosovo to succumb to the disease this year
[2010]. The patient, aged 50, was from the Gjakova municipality.

The clinic has registered some 357 patients this year [2010] who
complained of tick bites, but only 72 of them required further
treatment in hospital. Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, CCHF, is a
tick-borne disease.

"The patients come from a region in Kosovo where there is evidence of
the haemorrhagic fever," Prof Dr Shemsedin Dreshaj, the director of
the infectious disease clinic, told Balkan Insight. He added that for
the past 15 years an area that covers 4 municipalities has been the
region where the highest number of infected people has been found. In
2009, 13 persons were confirmed to be infected with CCHF virus, of
whom 2 persons died.

Explaining the situation in 2010, Dreshaj said: "75 patients either
had clinical signs or were bitten by a tick from the endemic region."
The affected region covers Suhareke municipality, Podrime region,
Malisevo municipality, and reaches to Istog municipality.

Dreshaj confirmed that there are no patients currently in danger. On a
daily basis the infectious disease clinic receives individuals
complaining of tick bites but after treatment they are discharged from
hospital. "There are ticks that are not infected [with the virus],
therefore people are not kept in hospital," Dreshaj stressed.

The youngest victim to succumb to the disease this year was an
11-year-old boy from Malisevo municipality who passed away on 21 May
2010.

Dreshaj said that the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Health
had conducted decontamination activities in the affected areas.
"Disinfection starts in early spring but this does not eliminate all
infected ticks," Dreshaj explained. He added that ticks lay the eggs
50 to 70 centimetres [20-28 in] under the ground, making it difficult
to eliminate the disease. "This makes the process a bit difficult."
[But see comment below].

Dreshaj recommends that people who live in affected regions avoid
areas where ticks are plentiful and wear long clothes [long sleeves
and pants] when working outside.

[The bit about ticks laying eggs 2 ft underground is nonsense. Female
ixodid ticks, the vectors of CCHF virus, lay their eggs in a
gelatinous mass stuck to their body, then die and stay on the surface.
