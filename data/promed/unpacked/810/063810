There is an outbreak of leptospirosis in the northeastern part of Surin district [Surin province]. 107 cases have been confirmed and 7 people are dead. Health authorities of the prefecture consider farmers at great risk and recommend that they wear rubber boots and rubber gloves in order to prevent infection during farm work.

Leptospirosis is an infection caused by Gram negative bacteria of the genus _Leptospira_ (the natural host are wild animals such as rats). It is a zoonotic disease and infection occurs orally and percutaneously from water and soil. In humans, the incubation period is about 3-14 days and symptoms include chills, fever, headache, malaise, and myalgia. In the mild form, patients soon recover. However, in the severe form (Weil's disease), jaundice, bleeding, kidney failure, and liver damage are observed, and the mortality rate is 5-50 percent. Epidemics of leptospirosis occur from July to October in Southeast Asia, including Thailand.

[Leptospirosis outbreaks occur with some regularity during periods of flooding in Thailand as a result of people wading through contaminated water. Most cases occur among agricultural workers, notably rice producers. The principal reservoirs in Thailand are chronically infected rats and dogs that excrete _Leptospira_ in their urine (see ProMED-mail posts Leptospirosis - Thailand (02) 19971121.2345 and Leptospirosis - Thailand (Nan)(02): background 20060913.2592).

Surin province, with a population of 1,375,257 in 2006, is located in the north east of Thailand and borders Cambodia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surin_Province).
