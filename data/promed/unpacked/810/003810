Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus -- Lao People's Democratic Republic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
On [8 Oct 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) notified WHO of one confirmed type 1 vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) case.

Details of the case
In Lao PDR, one case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) was confirmed, with onset of paralysis on [7 Sep 2015]. The patient was 8 years old when he died on [11 Sep 2015].

Genetic sequencing of the virus confirmed on [6 Oct 2015] that it is vaccine-derived and suggests that it has been circulating in the area for more than 2 years. The child was in the district of Bolikhan, in Bolikhamxay Province. The district has chronically low immunization rates: reported coverage with 3 doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV) was of 40 percent to 66 percent between 2009 and 2014; and 44 percent in 2015 to date.

Lao's last case of indigenous wild poliovirus was reported in 1993.

Public health response
Comprehensive outbreak response activities are taking place in response to this outbreak, in line with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative Standard Operating Procedures for responding to a poliovirus outbreak. A joint team of the Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization, UNICEF and the Lao Office of US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team travelled to the province for further assessment on [7 Oct 2015]. A rapid survey conducted in the affected village showed low vaccine coverage for OPV. Active case finding in the surroundings of the case's household is ongoing; stool specimens are being collected from healthy children in the case household and community.

Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) at the national and province level have been activated to coordinate outbreak response activities. Preparations are under way for large-scale supplementary OPV immunization campaigns covering Bolikhamxay province and several adjacent provinces. The scope of additional campaigns will be ascertained following completion of the ongoing investigations.

WHO risk assessment
Circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) are rare but well-documented strains of poliovirus mutated from strains in oral polio vaccine (OPV). They can emerge in some populations that are inadequately immunized.

Ending polio for good requires eliminating both wild and vaccine-derived polio, and due to the risk of cVDPVs, use of OPV must be stopped to secure a lasting polio-free world. OPV will be withdrawn in a phased manner, beginning with the removal of type 2-containing OPV. The switch from trivalent to bivalent OPV, planned in April 2016, will reduce the risk of cVDPV substantially (as 90 percent of cVDPV is caused by type 2) and sets the stage to eventually stop using OPV altogether and transition to the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which cannot cause cVDPV.

Because of relatively limited travel to and from this area and the planned immunization activities, the World Health Organization (WHO) assesses the risk of international spread of the cVDPV1 from Lao to be low.

WHO advice
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

[The disconcerting news is the appearance of the circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) in Laos, combined with the very low vaccination rates. While cases of wild poliovirus (WPV) have not been seen in Laos since 1993, the existence of the cVDPV is a wake-up call that if a WPV was introduced into the country, there is a sufficient susceptible population to support transmission of the WPV within the country to lead to an outbreak.

Of note, this is the 3rd country to report cVDPV type 1 this year (2015) -- 2 cases were reported from the Ukraine and 9 cases were reported from Madagascar.

Health officials on [Thu 8 Oct 2015] confirmed Karachi's 1st poliovirus case of 2015, almost a year after the last case was reported from the port city.

It was no surprise that the parents of the victim, an 18-month-old girl, had refused polio vaccination to the child. The family belongs to Waziristan and lives in Shafiq Colony, Gulberg Town, adjacent to Sohrab Goth, a predominantly Pakhtun [Pashtun] and Afghan locality.

The latest polio case was reported from the area classified as 'high-risk' for polio vaccinators which implies that health workers administering polio drops in the locality can be attacked, even killed for defying a ban imposed by Taliban on anti-polio drives.

At least 23 polio cases were reported from the city last year [2014] despite repeated anti-polio drives, health officials said, explaining that the refusal-cases undo all efforts of wiping out the disease.

Polio-vaccinators expressed concerns over security lapse. The number of police escorting the vaccination teams was half than what was committed by the government.

[The 1st poliomyelitis case of 2015 has been reported from Karachi. The child is from a predominantly Pashtun and Afghan locality and a 'high-risk' area for vaccinators. The child's parents refused to vaccinate the child.

While the number of poliomyelitis cases in 2015 in Pakistan has gone down substantially compared to the number of cases in 2014, pockets of high-risk areas with low vaccination rates continue to hinder the efforts to eradicate poliomyelitis from the country. Of note, Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only 2 polio-endemic countries in the world.

Another 2 polio cases have emerged in Peshawar [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa] and Quetta [Balochistan] after which the number of such cases reported in the country this year [2015] has reached 35.

The sources in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health Department said that the fresh polio case was witnessed in Sheikhan rural area of Peshawar where a 1-year-old girl was diagnosed with poliovirus.

They said that the after the emergency of this case in Peshawar, a total of 9 polio cases have been confirmed in the Provincial Capital [Peshawar] while 14 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the current year [2015].

Separately, a new case of crippling polio disease was also confirmed in a child in Quetta on [Tue 29 Sep 2015].

The Polio Emergency Control Room's sources said that the latest case was found in 3-year-old boy resident of [Kalli Barakzai] at Eastern Bypass in Quetta.

The sources said that the number of polio cases during 2015 has risen to 6 with this case in Balochistan, including 4 in Quetta, 1 in Loralai, and 1 in Killa Abdullah districts.

Last year [2014], a total of 306 polio cases were reported across the country.

Pakistan and Afghanistan remain the only 2 countries in the world where polio remains endemic. Earlier, Nigeria was also in the United Nations list of countries where polio existed but recently the World Health Organization (WHO) said that Nigeria and Africa as a whole are now closer to be certified polio-free.

Health authorities have detected a fresh polio case in Kalli Barakzai area of Quetta on [Tue 29 Sep 2015].

According to the provincial health department, a 3-month-old boy has been diagnosed with polio. According to [his] parents, [the boy] was administered polio drops 7 times.

So far, 7 polio cases have been registered in Balochistan this year [2015]. 5 cases were confirmed in Quetta, 1 in Loralai, and 1 in Killa Abdullah [district].

Pakistan, along with Afghanistan and Nigeria, are the only 3 countries in the world where polio remains endemic [see comment above]. The highly contagious virus is transmitted in unsanitary conditions but is easily fended off with a vaccine.

[According to the news reports above, 2 new pediatric cases of poliomyelitis have been reported from Peshawar (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) and Quetta (Balochistan) bringing the total number of cases to 35 in the country so far in 2015. The age of the child from Quetta is confusing since different ages are mentioned in the news reports. However, according to the child's parents, the child received oral polio vaccine 7 times. The total number of cases from Balochistan is reported to be 7 in 2015 according to the 2nd news report.

Of note, more than 50 percent vaccine refusals has been reported from Balochistan in 2015 (see ProMED-SoAs archive no. 20150908.3630723).

The Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) officials have informed of new polio cases identified in eastern Nangarhar province of Afghanistan.

MoPH spokesman Wahidullah Mayar said the 3 new polio cases were identified in Achin and Shirzad districts.

The 2 districts are among the most volatile districts of Nangarhar province where anti-government armed militant groups including the newly emerged ISIS loyalists are actively operating.

This comes as at least 3 children have been diagnosed with polio in Kandahar city, Dund, and Panjwai districts last year [2014].

According to the local government officials one of the children diagnosed with polio had repatriated to Kandahar from Karachi city of Pakistan, while 2 others have moved to Kandahar from Helmand and Uruzgan provinces.

Although polio has been eradicated from many countries, the disease remains rife in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The polio strain in Afghanistan and Pakistani is identical where over 1.5 million children crossing the frontier every year, with cross-border transmission remaining an inevitable eventuality.

Currently Afghan health workers are positioned at the border crossings in an attempt to monitor all children who cross, vaccinating any who are at risk of contracting the disease.

However, many people do not cross the border at formal customs posts, choosing instead to use tracks across the mountains and deserts. This makes it increasingly difficult for health workers to identify any potential health risks.

[According to the last report from the Afghanistan Polio Eradication Initiative website (http://www.polioeradication.org/Keycountries/Afghanistan.aspx), the last reported case (prior to the report above) had onset of paralysis on 7 Aug 2015 in Zaranj district of Nimroz province. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2015 now stands at 12 after the addition of the new cases.

A number of positive efforts and measures have been undertaken by the 2 nations and the case counts have decreased considerably as compared to 2014. However, in order to achieve complete eradication status, collective and continued efforts by both countries, particularly across the large border areas, are still required. - Mod.UBA

[6] Nigeria - removed from endemic country list - WHO press release

Source: Global Polio Eradication Initiative, WHO press release [edited]
http://www.polioeradication.org/mediaroom/newsstories/WHO-Removes-Nigeria-from-Polio-Endemic-List-/tabid/526/news/1291/Default.aspx


The World Health Organization announced today [25 Sep 2015] that Nigeria is no longer polio endemic. This is the 1st time that Nigeria has interrupted transmission of wild poliovirus, bringing the country and the African region closer than ever to being certified polio-free.

The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), the public-private partnership leading the effort to eradicate polio, called this a 'historic achievement' in global health. Nigeria has not reported a case of wild poliovirus since [24 Jul 2014], and all laboratory data have confirmed a full 12 months have passed without any new cases.

As recently as 2012, Nigeria accounted for more than half of all polio cases worldwide. Since then, a concerted effort by all levels of government, civil society, religious leaders and tens of thousands of dedicated health workers have resulted in Nigeria successfully stopping polio. More than 200 000 volunteers across the country repeatedly immunized more than 45 million children under the age of 5 years, to ensure that no child would suffer from this paralysing disease. Innovative approaches, such as increased community involvement and the establishment of Emergency Operations Centres at the national and state level, have also been pivotal to Nigeria's success.

The interruption of wild poliovirus transmission in Nigeria would have been impossible without the support and commitment of donors and development partners. Their continued support, along with continued domestic funding from Nigeria, will be essential to keep Nigeria and the entire region polio-free.

Polio, which can cause lifelong paralysis, has now been stopped nearly everywhere in the world following a 25-year concerted international effort. Polio remains endemic in only 2 countries -- Pakistan and Afghanistan. The eradication of polio globally now depends primarily on stopping the disease in these countries. As long as polio exists anywhere, it's a threat to children everywhere.

Nigeria has made remarkable progress against polio, but continued vigilance is needed to protect these gains and ensure that polio does not return. Immunization and surveillance activities must continue to rapidly detect a potential re-introduction or re-emergence of the virus. After 3 years have passed without a case of wild poliovirus on the continent, official 'certification' of polio eradication will be conducted at the regional level in Africa.

Eradicating polio will be one of the greatest achievements in human history, and have a positive impact on global health for generations to come. Nigeria has brought the world one major step closer to achieving this goal and it's critical that we seize this opportunity to end polio for good and ensure future generations of children are free from this devastating disease.

[This was very welcome news, reducing the number of polio endemic countries to 2 -- Pakistan and Afghanistan. Reviewing prior annual statistics on polio cases maintained by WHO (and the Polio Eradication Initiative), in 2014 Nigeria had reported 6 cases of WPV associated disease and 30 cases of cVDPV2 associated disease. In 2013 there were 57 cases of WPV and 4 of cVDPV2, in 2012 there were 130 cases of WPV and 8 of cVDPV2, in 2011 there were 95 cases of WPV and 34 cases of cVDPV2, in 2010 there were 95 cases of WPV and 27 of cVDPV2, in 2009 there were 48 cases of WPV and 155 cVDPV, in 2008 there were 541 cases of WPV and 68 cVDPV, in 2007 there were 541 cases of WPV and 71 cases of cVDPV, and in 2006 there were 861 cases of WPV and 22 cases of cVDPV2. Looking at the annual figures for WPV, while there wasn't a clear pattern of epidemic years every 3 or 4 years, there was a suggestion that this was the case. The challenge here will be to maintain high levels of coverage throughout the country as well as maintain high levels of surveillance for poliovirus (both WPV as well as cVDPV), including environmental sampling to detect possible "under the radar" (silent) circulation of the WPV. Experience has shown that the WPV has circulated elsewhere silently over the course of 1 or 2 years. In 2011 (see prior ProMED-mail report Poliomyelitis - worldwide (13): Kenya, China, Pakistan 20110920.2860), there were 3 cases of WPV1 in the Western Province of Kenya that were identified genetically as related to one found in Uganda's Bugiri in District in 2010.

(Data on WPV and cVDPV in Nigeria were taken from http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tsincidencepolio.html and http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Circulatingvaccinederivedpoliovirus.aspx.

Implementation as of [15 Aug 2015].

Highlights of the week:
- Afghanistan became the final polio-endemic country to introduce the inactivated polio vaccine on [30 Sep 2015] as part of the biggest globally synchronized vaccine introduction in history.
- This week, the Independent Monitoring Board is meeting in London to assess progress towards polio eradication and to make recommendations for the coming months. The report is expected to be published in the next few weeks.

Afghanistan
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [6 Sep 2015] in Sherzad district of Nangarhar province. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2015 remains 12.
- Genetic sequencing is awaited to determine whether these cases represent spread of the virus previously reported in Achin or whether they are new importations from neighbouring Pakistan. Afghanistan has repeatedly stopped poliovirus transmission following importations in this region, and previous experience is driving the response to these cases.
- One new environmental sample positive for WPV1 was collected in Kandahar on [26 Aug 2015].
- Environmental surveillance allows detection of continuing circulation of polioviruses, not just in known infected areas but also in areas without confirmed polio cases. Environmental surveillance continues to be a very helpful supplemental surveillance tool enabling the programme to increase the overall sensitivity of surveillance for polioviruses.
- National Immunization Days (NIDs) will take place on [18-20 Oct 2015] using trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) and Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) are planned from [15-17 Nov 2015] in the south and east of the country using bivalent OPV.

Pakistan
- Four new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were confirmed in the past week; 2 with onset of paralysis in Peshawar district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, one in Quetta district of Balochistan and one in FR Peshawar district of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, which is the 1st case in this district in 2015. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [16 Sep 2015] in Peshawar. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2015 is now 36, compared to 186 at this time last year [2014].
- No new type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week, and no cases have been reported in 2015. The number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2014 remains 22. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [13 Dec 2014].
- Two new environmental samples positive for WPV1 were reported in the last week, one collected in Peshawar district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on [24 Aug 2015] and the 2nd in Quetta district of Balochistan on [28 Aug 2015].

Central Africa
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. No cases have been reported in 2015. In 2014, 10 cases were reported in central Africa: 5 in Cameroon and 5 in Equatorial Guinea. The most recent case in central Africa was in Cameroon, with onset of paralysis on [9 Jul 2014].
- In October [2015], National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned in Angola, Chad, Equatorial Guinea and the Republic of Congo, and Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) in the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, all using trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV).

Horn of Africa
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in the past week and no cases have been reported in 2015. The total number of WPV1 cases that were reported in the Horn of Africa in 2014 was 6: 1 in Ethiopia (with onset of paralysis on [5 Jan 2014]) and 5 in Somalia. The most recent case of WPV1 in the Horn of Africa had onset of paralysis on [11 Aug 2014] in the Hobyo district of Mudug province, central Somalia.
- No cases of type 2 circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) have been reported in the past week. No cases have been reported in 2015. In 2014, 2 cases were reported in South Sudan. The most recent case of cVDPV2 had onset of paralysis in South Sudan on [12 Sep 2014].
- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned in Somalia in October [2015], and Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) in South Sudan. In November [2015], NIDs are planned in Kenya and South Sudan and SNIDs in Ethiopia, Somalia and South Sudan.

Madagascar
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis in Mahajanga 1 district of Mahajanga province with onset of paralysis on [7 Jul 2015]. The total number of cVDPV1 cases for 2015 remains 9. The total number of cVDPV1 cases reported in 2014 was one.
- The 2015 cases are genetically linked to the case reported in September 2014, indicating prolonged and widespread circulation of the virus.
- The emergency outbreak response continues to be intensified. A 2nd round of National Immunization Days (NIDs) took place in September [2015] covering an expanded age group of up to 15 years. Extended age group NIDs are also planned for [12-16 Oct 2015] using bivalent oral polio vaccine, and in November [2015] with dates to be confirmed.

Middle East
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in the past week. No cases have been reported in 2015. Three cases of WPV1 were reported in the Middle East in 2014 -- 2 in Iraq and 1 in Syria.
- The most recent case reported from Syria had onset of paralysis on [21 Jan 2014], while the most recent case in Iraq had onset of paralysis in Mada'in district, Baghdad-Resafa province, on [7 Apr 2014].
- Phase III of the Middle East outbreak response is continuing to further strengthen vaccination services for vulnerable populations and to strengthen surveillance for polioviruses across the region.

Nigeria
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. No cases have been reported in 2015. Nigeria's total WPV1 case count for 2014 remains 6. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [24 Jul 2014] in Sumaila Local Government Area (LGA), southern Kano state.
- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis in Kwali Local Government Area (LGA), Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja, with onset of paralysis on [16 May 2015]; this is the only cVDPV2 case reported in Nigeria in 2015.
- In September [2015] Nigeria was removed from the list of polio-endemic countries following all samples in the polio laboratory being tested negative for wild poliovirus for a whole year following the most recent case on [24 Jul 2014]. This is the 1st time that Nigeria has interrupted transmission of wild poliovirus, bringing the country and the African region closer than ever to being certified polio-free. Vigilance must be maintained to ensure that all children are reached with polio vaccines and that surveillance systems remain alert to polioviruses.
- Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) are planned in the north of the country on [17-19 Oct 2015] using trivalent OPV and on [5-7 Dec 2015] using bivalent OPV.

Ukraine
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases have been reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [7 Jul 2015] in the Zakarpatskaya oblast, in south-western Ukraine, bordering Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland. The number of cVDPV1 cases reported in 2015 remains 2.
- Ukraine had been at particular risk of emergence of a cVDPV, due to inadequate vaccination coverage. In 2014, only 50 percent of children were fully immunized against polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases.
- Discussions are currently ongoing with national health authorities to plan and implement an urgent outbreak response.

West Africa
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in the past week. The most recent WPV1 case in West Africa (excluding Nigeria) occurred in Tahoua province, Niger, with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case, a 19-month old boy, had onset of paralysis on [20 Jul 2015] in Guinea but was reported in Bamako, Mali. This case has officially been reassigned to Guinea. The closest genetic match to this case is from a case from Kankan, Guinea, from [30 Aug 2014]. Discussions are currently ongoing with national health authorities to plan and implement an urgent outbreak response following the cVDPV2 outbreak.
- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned in Benin and Mali, and Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) in Burkina Faso, Ghana and Niger in October [2015] using trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV).

[On reading the global summary, one feels a guarded optimism that there is a light at the end of the tunnel ... the world is down to only 2 endemic countries for WPV circulation ... but the guarding relates to the continued occurrence of cVDPV in Africa (Guinea/Mali, Nigeria, Madagascar), Europe (Ukraine), and Asia (Laos -- see section [1] above). The identification of cVDPV is an indicator of sub-optimal vaccination coverages that should WPV be reintroduced into these countries, there are sizeable susceptible populations to permit local transmission of the WPVs.

What is also added to the "guarded optimism" are the realities that there remain parts of the world with civil unrest and strife where vaccination activities have been compromised leading to sub-optimal vaccination coverages, also leaving these areas at risk for WPV circulation should it be reintroduced, and perhaps continued silent circulation.

A map showing the locations of WPV associated cases globally can be found at http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Poliocasesworldwide.aspx, and a map showing the locations of cVDPV cases can be found at: http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Circulatingvaccinederivedpoliovirus.aspx. - Mod.MPP]
