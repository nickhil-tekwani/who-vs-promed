First report of _Xylella fastidiosa_ subsp. _fastidiosa_ in Germany
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The NPPO of Germany recently informed EPPO of the first finding of _Xylella fastidiosa_ (EPPO A1 List) on its territory. The bacterium was detected on a single plant of _Nerium oleander_ in a nursery in Saxony. In 1 greenhouse, during an official phytosanitary inspection, 1 potted oleander showing unusual symptoms was observed. This plant belonging to private owners had been brought to the greenhouse for the first time to overwinter and had been produced by cutting from another plant belonging to a private person at least 4 years before.

Samples were tested by the official laboratory of Saxony and the JKI [Julius Kuehn Institut]. In July 2016, results confirmed the presence of _Xylella fastidiosa_ [Xf] subsp. _fastidiosa_ in the symptomatic plant. Other potential host plants in the greenhouse (including a symptomatic potted olive tree) and within a radius of 100 m [approx. 33 feet] around the infected oleander were tested (87 samples) but all results were negative. The presence of potential insect vectors of Xf was investigated within a radius of 100 m [approx. 33 feet]. One adult of _Philaenus spumarius_ and 1 adult of _Cercopis vulnerata_ [froghoppers] were caught. Sampling and investigations are continuing.

Eradication measures were immediately taken, including 14 potted oleander and olive plants from the greenhouse. Demarcated areas are being delimited around the infected site, the buffer zone also includes part of Thuringia.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem in infected plants, causing wilting, necrosis and often death of the host. It has been reported from a number of crops causing very serious diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine; leaf scorch of coffee, almond and olive; phony disease of peach; leaf scald of plum; variegated chlorosis of citrus; lucerne dwarf; as well as leaf scorch of elm, oak, plane, mulberry, maple, oleander and other woody ornamentals. Latent infections of a number of wild species have also been reported and these may serve as pathogen reservoirs. While all strains of _Xylella_ have been classified into a single species, there are different pathotypes, most of which have not been characterised and compared with each other yet. Several subspecies have been proposed and more research is needed to determine host range and risks to crops of the spectrum of Xf strains.

_X. fastidiosa_ is spread by xylem-feeding insect vectors. It can also be spread by grafting and with infected plant material, but is not seed-borne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore Xf-associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of potential reservoir hosts and vectors and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious quarantine concern. The pathogen has been added to the EPPO quarantine lists.

The pathogen has been reported mainly from the Americas, but was also detected on grapevine in Taiwan in 2013 (ProMED-mail post 20130806.1866205). In Europe, it seems likely that the outbreak on olives in Italy (ProMED-mail posts 20131101.2033095, 20140820.2708739 & 20140424.2425497) represents the 1st report of the pathogen in that region. While a source of the European incursion is currently still unproven, suggestions that it was due to contaminated imports of plant material appear likely. In 2015, Xf was also reported from France on ornamental coffee plants and amenity trees (ProMED-mail post 20150422.3313661 & 20150727.3538734). The froghopper species _P. spumarius_ mentioned above was identified as a vector in Italy.

Xf subsp. _fastidiosa_ is the cause of Pierce's Disease of grapevine. In the German source listed below it is stated that this is the first report of this subspecies in Europe. Leaf scorch of oleander has been reported to be due to ssp. _sandyi_ and possibly also _pauca_, but subsp. _fastidiosa_ has never been reported to affect this host. Ssp. _pauca_ has been reported to cause diseases on coffee and citrus. Olives in Italy are also thought to be infected by a somewhat atypical form of ssp. _pauca_ ( see link below), but this host has also been reported to be susceptible to ssp. _fastidiosa_ and _multiplex_ elsewhere. It appears that further research is needed for clear characterisation and host range delineation of Xf subspecies.

In the same source report as the story above, ssp. _pauca_ on olives in Brazil has also been reported for the first time (item no. 134), and vector studies on grape and pear isolates of Xf in Taiwan show different efficiencies of vector species depending on Xf ssp. (item no.135).
