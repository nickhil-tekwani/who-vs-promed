The San Antonio Metropolitan Health District has initiated a campaign to re-educate the population about syphilis, as the city has seen an increase in the number of congenital syphilis cases over the past couple of years.

Metro Health said San Antonio is number 2 in the state in the number of syphilis cases per capita. Last year [2012] in Bexar County, 18 babies were born with syphilis, and the department said that number should be zero.

Dr Anil Mangla of the Metro Health District said the city is reaching out to all the local hospitals, the medical school, and local health providers to step up the testing of pregnant women and to educate their patients about the rapidly spreading disease.

"We are actually reaching out to all hospitals," Mangla said. "As a matter of fact, I've started presenting grand rounds at the hospitals and the medical school on congenital syphilis and making people aware, because the population, as well as many of the providers, think this is a problem of the past. But it hasn't gone away yet."

[Syphilis is a bacterial infection caused by the spirochete _Treponema pallidum_. Transmission from mother to fetus during maternal spirochetal bloodstream infection can occur through the placenta. Transmission may also occur during delivery if maternal genital lesions are present. Late abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal death may result from congenital infection in untreated pregnancies. Among survivors, manifestations that develop in the 1st 2 years of life are called "early" and are similar to adult secondary syphilis; manifestations that develop after age 2 years are called "late" and include tooth abnormalities (Hutchinson teeth), bone changes (saber shins), "Clutton's joints" (bilateral painless swelling of the knee joints), neurological involvement, blindness, and deafness.

Control of congenital syphilis is achieved by antenatal screening and treatment of mothers who are infected. Serologic testing for syphilis of the mother's serum is preferred rather than testing of the infant's serum because the serologic tests performed on infant serum can be nonreactive if the mother's serologic test result is of low titer or the mother was infected late in pregnancy (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/genital-ulcers.htm#syphilis). Screening should be performed at the 1st prenatal visit in all pregnant women, as well as in the 3rd trimester and at delivery in communities and populations in which the risk for congenital syphilis is high. Groups at high risk include uninsured women, women living in poverty, sex workers, illicit drug users, women diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases, and those living in communities with high syphilis morbidity (http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf09/syphilis/syphpgsum.htm).

For the treatment of syphilis during pregnancy, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends parenteral benzathine penicillin G. Penicillin is effective for preventing maternal transmission to the fetus and for treating fetal infection. Pregnant women should be treated with the penicillin regimen appropriate for their stage of infection. Because evidence is limited regarding the efficacy or safety of alternative antibiotics in pregnancy, women who report penicillin allergies should be evaluated and desensitized to penicillin if necessary. See http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/genital-ulcers.htm#syphilis for other management considerations and follow-up.

No infant should leave the hospital without the maternal serologic status having been determined at least once during pregnancy; in communities and populations in which the risk for congenital syphilis is high, documentation should also occur at delivery. See http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/genital-ulcers.htm#syphilis for evaluation and treatment of infants for congenital syphilis.

San Antonio is the 7th most populous city in the US and the 2nd most populous city located in the south-central part of the state of Texas, with a population of 1.3 million; San Antonio serves as the seat of Bexar County (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio).
