Horse euthanised after 1st Hendra virus case in 5 years reported in Queensland
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Queensland has recorded its 1st case of Hendra virus since 2017 after a horse tested positive in Mackay.

Biosecurity Queensland said the result was confirmed on Friday [8 Jul 2022] and the horse was euthanised after its condition deteriorated rapidly.

It isolated the property as staff worked to identify the source of the virus and ensure humans had not been exposed.

"Tracing and risk assessments have been undertaken on other animals on the property," Biosecurity Queensland's chief veterinary officer, Allison Crook, said.

"We are working with the property and horse owners to ensure the risk is contained on the property."

The horse having tested positive had not been vaccinated against Hendra.

The virus was discovered in 1994 following an outbreak of illness in horses at a racing stable in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra. It can spread from flying foxes (a type of bat) to horses, horses to horses and, rarely, from horses to people. It can be fatal in humans.

"Hendra virus infection can occur throughout the year so it's important horse owners take steps to protect themselves and their animals at all times," Crook said.

Horse owners are urged to seek advice if an animal shows any symptoms of the virus, including a rapid onset of fever, an increased heart rate and rapid deterioration with respiratory and/or neurological signs.

"If a horse becomes sick, owners should contact their veterinarian immediately," Crook said.

"People in contact with horses need to remember to continue to practise good biosecurity and personal hygiene measures even if a horse is vaccinated against Hendra virus."

Deadly bat-born virus hits Australia for the 1st time in 5 years as authorities scramble to contain the outbreak
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A deadly virus capable of spreading to humans infected a horse for the 1st time in 5 years on a Queensland property. The case of Hendra virus, detected on Friday [8 Jul 2022] in Mackay, is the 1st confirmed case of the infection in horses in the state since 2017.

Hendra is generally contained amongst fruit bat populations.

The virus has killed more than half of the people who have contracted an infection, the majority of whom were vets.

Biosecurity Queensland said they were working on containing the outbreak, having put down the horse and tested other animals on the property. Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Allison Crook said the horse's condition rapidly deteriorated after it caught the virus.

'Tracing and risk assessments have been undertaken on other animals on the property,' Dr Crook said.

'We are working with the property and horse owners to ensure the risk is contained on the property.

'We are also working with Queensland Health's Public Health experts to determine if any humans had contact with the infected horse and stand ready to provide any assistance, counselling, information, testing or treatment that may be required.'

Dr Crook also revealed the horse hadn't been vaccinated against the virus.

'Hendra virus infection can occur throughout the year, so it's important that horse owners take steps to protect themselves and their animals at all times,' said Dr Crook.

'If a horse becomes sick, owners should contact their veterinarian immediately.'

The Hendra virus is common within fruit bat or flying-fox communities, with all 4 mainland species of flying fox considered natural hosts.

Infections amongst flying foxes cause minimal problems except in the event the infection is transferred to horses.

The virus has a much harsher effect on humans than flying foxes and people can contract it by handling infected horses.

Humans are considered unlikely to spread the virus between themselves.

The last person to die from the virus was Rockhampton vet Alister Rodgers in 2009.

'People in contact with horses need to remember to continue to practise good biosecurity and personal hygiene measures even if a horse is vaccinated against Hendra virus,' said Dr Crook.

What is Hendra virus?
---------------------
Hendra virus is a virus infecting large fruit bats (flying foxes).

Occasionally the virus can spread from flying foxes to horses and horses can then pass the infection on to humans. A small number of people who had very close contact with infected horses have developed Hendra virus infection.

Hendra virus was discovered following an outbreak of illness in a large racing stable in the suburb of Hendra, Brisbane in 1994.

Hendra virus can cause a range of symptoms in horses. Usually there is a rapid onset of illness, fever, increased heart rate and rapid deterioration with respiratory and/or neurological (nervous system) signs.

In humans, the virus can be fatal. Symptoms typically develop between 5 and 21 days after contact with an infectious horse.

Fever, cough, sore throat, headache and tiredness are common initial symptoms. Meningitis or encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) can develop, causing headache, high fever, and drowsiness, and sometimes convulsions and coma.

[Hendra virus is a virus that mainly infects large fruit bats (flying foxes) which can be passed on to horses. The infection has occasionally been passed onto people who have been in close contact with an infected horse.

What is Hendra virus?
• Hendra virus is a virus that infects large fruit bats (flying foxes).
• Occasionally the virus can spread from flying foxes to horses and horses can then pass the infection on to humans. A small number of people who had very close contact with infected horses have developed Hendra virus infection.
• Hendra virus infection has been confirmed in 2 dogs on properties where horses had been infected with the Hendra virus. Neither dog was showing signs of illness.
• There is no evidence of Hendra virus occurring naturally in any other species.
• Hendra virus was discovered following an outbreak of illness in a large racing stable in the suburb of Hendra, Brisbane in 1994.

What are the symptoms?
Hendra virus symptoms in horses
• Hendra virus can cause a range of symptoms in horses. Usually there is a rapid onset of illness, fever, increased heart rate and rapid deterioration with respiratory and/or neurological (nervous system) signs. For more information on Hendra virus infection in horses, refer to the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI).

Hendra virus symptoms in people
• Symptoms typically develop between 5 and 21 days after contact with an infectious horse.
• Fever, cough, sore throat, headache and tiredness are common initial symptoms. Meningitis or encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) can develop, causing headache, high fever, and drowsiness, and sometimes convulsions and coma.
• Hendra virus infection can be fatal.

How is it spread?
• It is thought that horses may contract Hendra virus infection from eating food recently contaminated by flying fox urine, saliva or birth products.
• The spread of Hendra virus between horses is possible whenever horses have close contact with body fluids from an infected horse.
• All confirmed human cases to date became infected following high level exposures to body fluids of an infected horse, such as doing autopsies on horses without wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, or being extensively sprayed with respiratory secretions.
• There is no evidence of human to human, bat to human, bat to dog, or dog to human transmission.

Who is at risk?
People who have had close contact (particularly high level exposures as described above) with an infected horse, without wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, are most at risk.

How is it prevented?
Preventing horse infection
• Protect horse feed from contamination by flying fox fluids.
• Contact your local veterinarian if you notice unusual disease symptoms, abnormal behaviour or unexpected deaths in your horses. If you cannot contact your veterinarian, contact your animal health authority or the Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888 (24-hour hotline).
• Isolate sick horses from other horses.
• A vaccine for horses is available from veterinarians and is strongly encouraged as the single most effective way to reduce the risk of exposure to Hendra virus.

Preventing human infection
• While the greatest risk is with sick horses, infected horses can shed Hendra virus for a few days before they show any sign of illness so it is always important to use good hygiene practices when around horses.
• Don't kiss horses on the muzzle (especially if the horse is sick).
• Cover any cuts or abrasions on exposed skin before handling horses and wash your hands well with soap and water, especially after handling your horse's mouth or nose (e.g. fitting or removing a bridle) and before eating, smoking or touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
• If body fluids or manure from a horse gets on unprotected skin the area should be washed with soap and water as soon as possible.
• If a horse becomes unwell and Hendra virus infection may be a possibility, as few people as possible should care for the horse until the infection is ruled out.
• Appropriate personal protective equipment which prevents contamination of the skin, eyes, nose and mouth by the horse's body fluids should be worn if close contact with the sick horse is considered essential.
• Although there is no evidence of Hendra virus spreading from an infected person to another person or animal, health care workers will take a cautious approach and wear personal protective equipment when caring for people suspected or confirmed to be infected.
• If you have been exposed to Hendra virus, you should not donate blood or any other tissue until you are cleared of infection. Confirmed cases should never donate blood or any other tissue, even if they fully recover.
• No human vaccine is currently available.

How is it diagnosed?
People with suspected Hendra virus infection will usually have blood and urine tests. Depending on their symptoms they may also have nose/throat swabs and/or other tests. People with high level exposures to horse body fluids may have blood samples collected over 6 weeks to check if they have developed antibodies to the infection. Testing for Hendra virus infection is generally not recommended for people who have had lower-level exposure.

How is it treated?
There is no specific treatment for Hendra virus infection and cases are treated supportively in hospital or in intensive care. Antiviral medications have not been found to be effective in treating Hendra virus infection. People who have had high exposures to the body fluids of an infected horse may be offered experimental treatment with a type of antibody that may prevent infection.

What is the public health response?
• When a horse is diagnosed with Hendra virus infection, the local public health unit will work closely with the state/territory animal health agency, horse and property owners, and veterinarians to identify people who may have been exposed.
• Public health unit staff will identify people who may be at risk and contact them to assess their exposure.
• People who may be at risk of infection will be given information about Hendra virus and asked to monitor their health. Where necessary, arrangements will be made for blood tests to be taken.
