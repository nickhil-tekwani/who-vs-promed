[Though reported as a "recurrence" of FMD, most likely this event is not a new introduction but presents a continuation of the event that had started in northern Israel on 5 Sep 2018, caused by FMD virus O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2(QOM-15), which eventually spread westwards. Ein Ayala (map at https://tinyurl.com/y4a9bp9l) has most likely become outbreak No. 23 in the continuing event; it is 10 km [6.2 mi] southwest of the site of outbreak No. 22 (Daliyat-El-Carmel-Isfia). The latter was located 18 km [11.2 mi] southwest to outbreak No. 21, in Tamra.

The ability to detect 2 solitary clinical cases of FMD within a group of 600 apparently healthy cattle is remarkable. It may be attributed to the vigilance of the owners, combined with the operation of a computerized milking apparatus, which reports early changes in the milk production of individual animals. Last but not least, early detection and diagnosis are related to the prevailing system of clinical veterinary services by a countrywide insurance farmers' cooperative, which warrants a visit of the practitioner to every dairy farm twice weekly; additional calls on emergency, such as suspicion of disease, are free of charge. This allows early involvement of the State Veterinary Services, including the diagnostic FMD laboratory at the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan.

Information on the vaccination history of the herd will be useful. According to the prevailing FMD vaccination policy in Israel, the entire farm's cattle population, above the age of 3 months, should have been vaccinated 7-9 months ago. Checking whether there is currently sub-clinical infection in the rest of the farm's cattle population (e.g. by PCR-ing individual milk samples) may provide useful information, e.g. the efficacy of the applied vaccine.

To view the location of the 3 mentioned recent outbreaks in NW Israel, please go to OIE's interactive FMD map at https://tinyurl.com/y5x4do65; click on Israel to center, and repeatedly zoom in (to the scale 1:6 778 233). The new outbreak (red) is southwest of the previous 2 (blue) outbreaks. The route of spread has yet to be investigated. - Mod.AS
