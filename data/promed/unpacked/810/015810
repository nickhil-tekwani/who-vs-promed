International Journal of Infectious Diseases. 2019. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2019.01.008.

Highlights
- Dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in acute encephalitis syndrome (AES).
- Existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.
- Dengue accounts for 5% of AES cases in India, especially in the absence of laboratory evidence for other pathogens tested.
- Testing for dengue in AES cases must be included in routine surveillance.

Abstract
Background
AES surveillance in India has indicated that Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) accounts for 5-35% of AES cases annually; the etiology remains unknown in the remaining cases. We implemented comprehensive AES surveillance to identify other etiological agents of AES, with emphasis on dengue virus.

Methods
Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were collected from patients enrolled prospectively in AES surveillance from 2014-2017 at selected sites of 3 high-burden states of India. All samples were initially tested for JEV IgM. Specimens negative for JEV by serology were tested for IgM to scrub typhus, dengue virus (DEN), and West Nile virus; all JEV IgM-negative CSF samples were tested by PCR for _S. pneumoniae_, _N. meningitidis_, _H. influenzae_, herpes simplex virus type 1, enteroviruses, and DEN.

Results
Of 10 107 AES patients, an etiology could be established in 49.2% of patients, including JEV (16%), scrub typhus (16%), and DEN (5.2%) as the top 3 agents. Among the DEN-positive cases (359/6892), 7 (2%) were positive only for dengue virus RNA: one in serum and 6 in CSF.

Conclusion
Among the pathogens identified, dengue accounted for 5% of all AES cases and was one of the 3 common etiological agents. These results underscore the importance of including dengue virus in routine testing of AES cases.

[Frequently, in reports of JE cases in India, acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) of undefined etiology is often mentioned with JE cases, a minority of those hospitalized. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. The above retrospective study indicates that scrub typhus is responsible for 16% and dengue for 5% of AES cases. Dengue, as the authors state, should be included in testing of AES cases.
