--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in southern Africa has been characterised by 3 distinct waves. The 1st was associated with a mix of SARS-CoV-2 lineages, whilst the 2nd and 3rd waves were driven by the beta and delta variants, respectively (1-3). In November 2021, genomic surveillance teams in South Africa and Botswana detected a new SARS-CoV-2 variant associated with a rapid resurgence of infections in Gauteng Province, South Africa. Within 3 days of the 1st genome being uploaded, it was designated a variant of concern (omicron) by the World Health Organization and, within 3 weeks, had been identified in 87 countries. The omicron variant is exceptional for carrying over 30 mutations in the spike glycoprotein, predicted to influence antibody neutralization and spike function. Here, we describe the genomic profile and early transmission dynamics of omicron, highlighting the rapid spread in regions with high levels of population immunity.

[2] France: New variant
Date: Fri 7 Jan 2022
Source: Independent [edited]
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ihu-new-COVID-variant-france-what-b1988532.html


While the world is grappling with the highly infectious omicron strain of COVID, scientists in France have identified a potentially worrying new variant, which has 46 mutations.

Named IHU, the new B.1.640.2 variant is so far known to have infected 12 people living in southeastern France. The 1st case was linked to a person with a travel history to Cameroon, Western Africa, said researchers in a paper published on medRxiv [see citation below].

However, experts were quick to announce that just because a new variant had been discovered, that did not necessarily mean IHU will prove as infectious as other strains, including omicron.

In the analysis, the authors found "46 mutations" which had not been spotted in other countries, nor labelled a variant under investigation by the WHO.

The genomes were obtained by next-generation sequencing. The authors of the paper claimed that the person who was identified with the IHU variant was fully-vaccinated. The person tested positive for COVID after returning from a 3-day trip to Cameroon.

The authors of the research paper said, "subsequent detection... of 3 mutations in the spike gene to screen for variants... did not correspond to the pattern of the delta variant involved in almost all SARS-CoV-2 infections at that time."

[3] Mexico: cases
Date: Thu 6 Jan 2022
Source: NBC News, Reuters report [edited]
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/mexico-likely-surpass-300k-COVID-19-deaths-week-fifth-highest-worldwid-rcna11176


Mexico is likely to surpass 300 000 deaths from COVID-19 this week -- the 5th highest death toll worldwide -- as infections rise after the holiday season, fueled by the omicron coronavirus variant and largely unrestricted tourism.

Infections have more than doubled to 20 000 during the last week when many US tourists visited Mexico. 11 of Mexico's 32 states decided not to resume in-person school classes this week with cases climbing fast.

The arrival of the highly contagious omicron variant reversed a downturn in infections during the autumn [2021] when the widespread application of vaccines provided relief.

Some Mexicans said people had dropped their guard as the holidays came. "Since December [2021], a lot of people started to go out and there are many who no longer wear face masks," said Isauro Perez, a 53-year-old taxi driver in Mexico City. "If we don't take care of ourselves, the government won't take care of us."

As of Wed [5 Jan 2022], Mexico had registered 299 805 confirmed deaths from COVID-19, a figure that is likely significantly below the real toll, officials say.

Separate government data showed there had been nearly 452 000 deaths "linked to" COVID-19 by mid-December [2021], and lower testing has likely helped to understate the reach of the virus.

Mexico has the highest fatality rate -- deaths per confirmed cases -- among the 20 nations most affected by COVID-19 worldwide, according to an analysis by Johns Hopkins University.

Laurie Ximenez-Fyvie, an expert on molecular genetics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), said in the end, Mexico's death toll would be the ultimate yardstick of how the government had performed in the pandemic.

So far, she argued, it risked suffering "absolute failure."

[4] India: death toll
Date: Fri 7 Jan 2022
Source: New Scientist [edited]
https://www.newscientist.com/article/2237475-COVID-19-news-indias-death-toll-may-be-six-times-higher-than-thought/


India's death toll from COVID-19 may be 6-7 times greater than that officially recorded. The country's records say that nearly half a million people have died from coronavirus infections so far, but the latest study [see citation below] estimates the real figure is 3.2 million deaths up to July last year [2021].

If correct, this means the worldwide death toll from the coronavirus would be pushed up from 5.4 to 8.1 million -- although other countries may also have underestimated their death rates. "This may require substantial upward revision of the World Health Organization's estimates of cumulative global COVID mortality," Prabhat Jha at the University of Toronto and colleagues say in their paper.

India experienced a huge 2nd wave of coronavirus infections in the 1st half of 2021, leaving hospitals overwhelmed and a national shortage of oxygen supplies. In common with many other low and middle-income countries, India does not have good systemic methods for recording causes of death, especially those that occur in rural areas. For instance, Jha's team says that in 2020, an estimated 8 in 10 deaths did not involve medical certification, which is standard procedure in richer countries.

Jha's team reached the figure of 3.2 million by using government data on all-cause mortality and an ongoing telephone survey of 140 000 adults across the country, which asked people about COVID-19 symptoms and deaths in their households.

The military is being deployed to help in London hospitals due to staff shortages caused by COVID-19 infections and people self-isolating. The 200 members of the armed forces will include doctors, nurses, and other personnel for general assistance. London was the 1st part of England to experience the latest COVID-19 surge caused by the omicron variant.

People may need a 4th dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by autumn [2022] in the northern hemisphere, Stephane Bancel of vaccine manufacturer Moderna has said. Israel has approved giving 4th shots to healthcare workers and people over the age of 60.

[5] Finland: long COVID
Date: Fri 7 Jan 2022
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-finland-long-COVID-idUSKBN2JH14W


"Long COVID", where symptoms of COVID-19 persist for months after an initial infection, could be emerging as a chronic disease in Finland, Minister of Family Affairs and Social Services Krista Kiuru said on Friday [7 Jan 2021].

Speaking at a news conference, she referred to a Finnish expert panel's summary of more than 4000 international studies which showed one in 2 adults and around 2% of children may experience prolonged symptoms connected to COVID-19.

"There is a threat that Finland will see the emergence of the largest, or one of the largest, new groups of chronic diseases, and that not only too many adults will suffer from a long-term COVID-19, but at worst also children," Kiuru said.

The Finnish institute of health and welfare considers an illness chronic when it has a major impact on public health and the national economy through lowered working capacity and strains on healthcare.

The summary published by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health said long COVID was more likely when the initial infection had required hospitalisation, but it might also occur after a mild or asymptomatic infection.

"The virus has been shown to enter the brain through the nose and its effects are also seen on magnetic resonance imaging," Risto Roine, professor of neurology and chairman of the expert panel, told the same news conference.

"Around 20% see long-term cognitive impairment," Roine added, warning that the incidence of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's could increase sharply following a COVID-19 infection.

The Nordic nation of 5.5 million people recorded nearly 10 000 new coronavirus cases on Friday [7 Jan 2021], bringing its tally since the pandemic began to 305 522. 6 deaths brought the total in Finland to 1638.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A large study of children and young people who caught SARS-CoV-2 has found that as many as one in 7 (14%) may still have symptoms 15 weeks later.(1) However, this figure is lower than in some studies that have reported a prevalence of long COVID as high as 51% in children and young people.

Speaking at a Science Media Centre briefing, the study's lead author, Terence Stephenson, who is Nuffield professor of child health at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health in London, said, "It is reassuring that the figures were lower than the worst case scenarios predicted last December. However, they are not of trivial importance."

The Children and Young People with Long COVID (Clock) study is published as a preprint and has not yet been peer reviewed. But its strengths are that it is nationally representative, relies on PCR proven COVID status, and includes a COVID negative comparison control group.

The researchers contacted young people aged 11-17 from the database of test results held by Public Health England from January to March 2021. They sent questionnaires to 220 000 young people in England and received 17 000 responses.

This preliminary analysis included 3065 young people who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and a matched cohort of 3739 who had tested negative. Both groups completed detailed questionnaires 3 months after their test.

The researchers found that 15 weeks after their PCR test 66.5% of people who had tested positive and 53.3% of those who had tested negative had one or more symptoms. About 30% of those who had tested positive for COVID-19 had 3 or more symptoms, compared with 16% of those who tested negative. This enabled the researchers to conclude that 14% of people who test positive for COVID have persistent symptoms. The most common symptoms reported were headaches and tiredness.

The high numbers of young people who tested negative reporting symptoms at 15 weeks may be explained by tiredness being common in this age group generally and the survey period coinciding with the return of school after lockdown and a likely increase in non-COVID infections.

Wellbeing
---------
Roz Shafran, study coauthor from the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, said, "Our study also shows the importance of having a comparison group so that longlasting COVID-19 symptoms are not confused with non-COVID-related ill health. Without a control group of young people, our findings would be uninterpretable."

One limitation of the study is that the response rate was only 13.5%. The researchers say that if this 13% is representative of all 11-17-year-olds who have tested positive, 32 000 throughout England would still have 3 or more physical symptoms 3 months later. However, if only teenagers who responded to the survey had any persisting problems and those who chose not to respond had completely recovered, this would mean a best case scenario of 4000 cases of long COVID. These figures are over and above the background level of symptoms experienced by the negative test control group.

No difference was found in mental health and wellbeing scores between young people who tested positive and those who tested negative, but a high proportion in both groups reported being a bit or very worried, sad, or unhappy (41% of those who tested positive v 39% who tested negative.)

Liz Whittaker, senior clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial College London, told the briefing, "It's unclear at this time whether vaccination will prevent long COVID ... "

Commenting on the study, Nick Bishop, vice president for science and research at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said, "This is a carefully designed and conducted piece of work that adds significantly to what we know about the later effects of COVID-19 infection in some children and young people and, importantly, the differences found compared to adults."

In the past 24 hours, 28 countries including the USA (489 602), France (303 669), Spain (242 440), Italy (197 535), India (160 244), the UK (140 566), Argentina (101 689), Australia (93 309), Turkey (66 237), Brazil (49 303), Germany (42 422), Canada (41 723), Greece (37 670), Portugal (35 643), Colombia (31 170), Mexico (30 671), the Netherlands (27 890), Belgium (24 694), Philippines (26 211), Ireland (26 122), Israel (22 398), Bolivia (19 013), Russia (16 568), Viet Nam (16 553), Japan (13 913), Peru (12 833), Denmark (11 604), and Poland (10 897), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 5618 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 6 Jan to late 7 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last couple of weeks can be attributed to the rapid increase in the omicron variant cases in over 90 countries. Studies suggest that the omicron variant causes milder disease than the previously dominant delta variant, but the high number of cases caused by this highly infectious/transmissible variant could rapidly overwhelm hospitals and health systems. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 72 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 39 of the 75 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and 11 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 65.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 2.5%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 79.3% increase in daily reported cases and a 26.6% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: Globally, more than 2 200 000 newly confirmed infections were reported in the past 24 hours with over 306.03 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.50 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
