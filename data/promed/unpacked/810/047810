The World Organization for Animal Health [OIE] has announced that Ecuador has successfully eradicated foot and mouth disease. The government-sponsored Eradication of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Project, which began in 2011, has effectively wiped out the disease, which has existed in Ecuador since 1943, which means the export ban of Ecuadorean beef and dairy products can be lifted.

Prior to 2011, about half of Ecuador's 4.65 million cattle were vaccinated. Today, 98 per cent have been vaccinated as part of the eradication plan. As well as vaccination programs, the scheme successfully pushed forward technological development and laboratories, and has created jobs for technicians and some 300 veterinarians to work in the field and in educational initiatives.

The US$86 million project was considered a priority and seen as part of diversifying the economy and expanding exports. The general manager of the Livestock Association of the East and the Highlands, Juan Pablo Grijalva, said cattle production is "growing at a very fast rate, because there are policies that were established by the government with the private sector." The general coordinator of animal sanitation of Agrocalidad, Dr Javier Vargas, explained that the increase in production will allow Ecuador to open international markets.

Now with the necessary mechanisms and infrastructure to effectively combat foot and mouth, as well as other diseases, Ecuador has set the goal of reaching infection-free status by 2018 without vaccination, to further strengthen this national industry and secure international markets.

[This is splendid news. For years Ecuador lagged behind in FMD control with repeated outbreaks in the small dairy herds on the upper slopes of eastern side of the Andes and did not seem to be able to get their veterinary act together. But they did and they have been successful. It is marvellous.

There has been a large coordinated push to eradicate FMD from South America, led by Brazil. The current national vaccine coverages have been in the high 90 percent range. These have not been easy to achieve, as regions with extensive cattle rearing can be vast and with minimal infrastructure. Chile has been free of FMD for decades. We can confidentially expect FMD to be eradicated from these countries and formally recognised in the next few years. - Mod.MHJ
