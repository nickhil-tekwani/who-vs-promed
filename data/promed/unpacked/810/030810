New Source of Foot-and-mouth Disease Found in Argentina
--------------------------------------------------
On Wednesday, Argentine health authorities confirmed reports of a new
source of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in livestock south of the Colorado
River, an indication the disease has crossed the health barrier that was
established when it was first detected in the country.
The outbreak was detected some 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of the river,
near the city of Villarino in Buenos Aires province, according to the
National Animal Health and Quality Service (SENASA). This area had been
considered free of FMD. Up until Tuesday, 567 cases of the disease had been
reported in the country, according to the SENASA.
Argentine daily Rio Negro reported [that a ranch owner in the area warned
that 2 cows from a group of 80 appeared to have been infected with the
disease. Laboratory tests carried out last Monday in Buenos Aires confirmed
the 2 cattle were infected with FMD.
Following official regulations, all livestock within a 3-kilometer
(2-mile) radius of the source of infection were quarantined, while the
area within a 15-kilometer (9-mile) radius was declared under strict
surveillance.
Having denied the existence of the disease for several months, Argentine
authorities finally acknowledged the appearance of FMD in mid-March [2001,
which immediately prompted Brazil, the United States and Britain, among
other important markets, to ban Argentine beef imports.
Argentine beef exports fell more than 60 percent in the first quarter
this year, while beef producers are losing some $50 million monthly due
to the absence of these foreign markets, the CICC, Argentina's beef
chamber of commerce, reported.
According to provisional reports for this year's first quarter, Argentina
exported 37 455 tons of cattle at a value of $66.4 million, which
represents a 64.1 percent drop in volume and a 61.3 percent decrease in
value compared to the same period last year.
Argentina is the fourth-largest beef exporter worldwide, and, in May
2000, the South American country was declared free of foot-and-mouth
disease by the International Organization for Epizootics (OIE).
Argentina's status has been suspended and may be stripped during the
organization's assembly in Paris, to be held in the next few days.

Argentina finds foot-and-mouth in Patagonia
-------------------------------------------
Health authorities found cattle infected with the foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) virus in the historically disease-free zone of Patagonia in southern
Argentina, the national
food and animal health inspection agency Senasa said. "There are 2
outbreaks," said a Senasa spokeswoman.
Senasa said the infected animals were found in Rio Negro province, an
area in which the transport of cattle and meat products with bones is
banned.
The agency set up the sanitary barrier to protect cattle in Rio Negro and
other Patagonian provinces as part of an extensive plan to contain the
disease.
Last week, Senasa said authorities incinerated more than 2 tons of meat
with bone being illegally transported to the Patagonian province of Chubut,
south of Rio Negro.
This week's discovery of infected animals marks the failure of efforts to
prevent the spread of the virus, which is easily transported on clothing,
vehicles and even in the air.
Argentina, South America's second-biggest beef producer, lost nearly all
its export markets in March when officials said they had discovered
infected animals. That put in danger some $600 million in annual meat
exports.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) attache in Buenos Aires last
week cut his estimate for Argentine beef exports this year to 220 000
tonnes, or about 44 percent lower than the export forecast at the
beginning of the year.
