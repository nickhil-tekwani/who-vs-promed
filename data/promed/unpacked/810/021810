[2] Liberia: 1st Ebola death since July 2015
Date: Fri 4 Dec 2015

http://oceansidepost.com/2015/12/04/liberia-records-1st-ebola-death-since-july.html


Liberia said on [Mon 30 Nov 2015] that it had sought help from 2 experts from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the cause of the latest cases. The fatalities have been largely concentrated in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea -- Liberia alone has had more than 10 600 cases, and about 4800 people have died. The new Ebola cases in Liberia come less than a week after Guinea released its last patient and began the 42-day countdown to being declared Ebola-free... -- more

After releasing the 2 known Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases from hospital on [Thu 3 Dec 2015], Liberia has started a new countdown to the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of Liberia being free of the virus for a 3rd time, health officials said. According to Tolbert Nyenswah, head of Liberia's Ebola response "There are no cases in the ETUs (Ebola treatment units) in the entire Republic of Liberia," adding "EVD safety measures remain in place."

The 2 patients released from the Paynesville ETU are the father and younger brother of the presumed index case, a 15-year-old boy from a suburb of the capital Monrovia who died from the disease last week [week of 28 Nov 2015]. However, new cases could still emerge in Liberia since there are 165 contacts still under quarantine, of whom more than 30 are deemed high risk, health officials told Reuters.

Note: There have been reports of multiple breaches of EVD-prevention protocol, including the offices of Liberia's president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) failing to have "Ebola buckets" (buckets filled with water and chlorine) outside her offices) at the entry to their facilities... Reemergence of EVD cases in Liberia, possibly transmitted sexually by survivors, has called into question the current policy of declaring a country Ebola-free after 42 days.]

Nigeria: wife of Ebola survivor delivers baby girl in First Consultants Hospital
A healthy baby girl was born to [Dr Ada Igonoh] who is an Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivor. [Dr Igonoh] delivered the baby on 1 Dec 2015. According to the medical director of the hospital, Dr Benjamin Ohiaeri, "The baby girl, weighing 3 kg [6.6 lb] at birth (its placenta 450 g [1 lb]), a product of a term gestation, was delivered following strict guidelines and recommendations from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USA, through the pre-natal and delivery stages." -- more

[Media reports fail to note the important point that since Nigeria was declared Ebola-free on 19 Oct 2014 http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/137091/1/roadmapsitrep22Oct2014_eng.pdf, this lucky baby was conceived long after her father recovered from Ebola, showing that not all male survivors transmit infection sexually.

4 Dec 2015 Guinea-Bissau: awareness is the antidote to fear of Ebola
http://firstperson.oxfamamerica.org/2015/12/in-guinea-bissau-awareness-is-the-antidote-to-fear-of-ebola
["We've seen changes in people's habits. Now, many illnesses that used to come from the villages aren't appearing any more. I don't think people will forget that washing hands keeps their families healthy... Though the Ebola risks remain high, everyone I meet in the villages says NADEL [National Association for Local Development] and Femmes Travailleuses [National Commission of Women Workers] have helped them cope. A woman who lives in a community where [nurse] Cardoso works summed up the consensus: "Now, we have less fear of Ebola because we know what to do in order not to catch it."]

3 Dec 2015 Liberia: MoE mandates schools to reinstitute Ebola safety protocol

[In response to the reemergence of Ebola virus disease in Liberia, on (Tue 1 Dec 2015), Liberia's Minister of Education, Romelle A Horton, directed Liberia's school administrators and teachers to reinstitute temperature-monitoring system teams and hand-washing stations at school entries "in full observance of the School Safety Protocol."
In addition, the ministry is calling on all parents, community leaders, civil society groups and other relevant stakeholders to support the implementation of the school Ebola safety protocols at homes and in communities.]

4 Dec 2015 UK: Declining Ebola case numbers, new control methods prompt PHE screening scale-back
http://en.starafrica.com/news/declining-ebola-case-numbers-new-control-methods-prompt-phe-screening-scale-back.html
[Public Health England (PHE) is scaling down screening arrangements following a sustained decline in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Other factors influencing the decision include the introduction of new control methods such as a highly effective Ebola vaccination, the WHO declaring Sierra Leone Ebola transmission free and the continued low risk presented to the UK by the disease. Under the scaled back operations, from 5 Dec 2015 screening will stop for travellers from Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia. PHE will maintain its monitoring system for high-risk returning workers until the outbreak has been declared over in the affected countries.]

3 Dec 2015 USA: ACLU-Yale report finds Ebola quarantines medically unjustified and unconstitutional
http://enewspf.com/2015/12/03/aclu-yale-report-finds-ebola-quarantines-medically-unjustified-and-unconstitutional/
[A report by the America Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Yale Global Health Justice Partnership, issued 3 Dec 2015, recommends quarantine policies ensure future state responses to diseases are based on science, not politics.]
[But politicians had no choice but to respond "out of an abundance of caution" to the hysteria among the public in response to the news that the country was receiving large numbers of returning aid workers who had been exposed to Ebola patients. See also

3 Dec 2015 Liberia: 'UN Agencies, NGOs still withholding Ebola funds'
http://allafrica.com/stories/201512041083.html
[According to the former Minister of Health, Dr Walter T Gwenigale, who was the keynote speaker at the 1st Annual General & Scientific Meeting of the Liberia College of Physicians and Surgeons (LCPS), several United Nations agencies and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have not yet accounted for funds given to them to fight Ebola virus disease (EVD). Some of the funds have not yet been used, he stated. According to Dr Gwenigale, "All the money that was coming into this country during the Ebola period was not coming to the [Liberian] government. They were giving the funds to international NGOs, United Nations agencies, but people were coming to the government when other people were saying that the government got the money." Dr Gwenigale said the government must have a greater say in how funds are used whenever donors want to help the country, and is calling for a full accounting of the spent funds.]

[5] Vaccine injury compensation - correction
[Re my comment in item [3] Vaccine, of Ebola update (131): WHO, semen, susp., prevention, blood, vaccine 20151203.3838759: "A compensation system for vaccine injuries is needed for diseases such as Ebola (http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-12-compensation-vaccine-injuries-diseases-ebola.html), I misunderstood the suggestion to apply to survivors with post-Ebola syndrome, when in fact it only applies to post-vaccination injury. I withdraw my comment, and hope there will not be any undesirable long-term side effects from the vaccines. - Mod.JW]
