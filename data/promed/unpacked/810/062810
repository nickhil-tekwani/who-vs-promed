Dengue surveillance in French Guiana No. 7
-----------------------------------------------
Weekly Epidemiologic Status Report, Week 21, 2006 (22-28 May 2006);
Observations: The peak of the (dengue) epidemic was reached during week 14,
2006 (1055 suspected cases). By all indications, the number of suspected
cases for the entire department (of Guiana) is remaining constant (700
cases for week 21) during the last 3 weeks, except for the communities of
Cayenne, St. Georges, and Mana. For the 1st time since the beginning of the
epidemic, some cases have been detected in the community of Saul (one
confirmed case and 3 suspected cases). An investigation will be held in the
community to better assess the situation.
After strengthening the monitoring since week 14, 2006, it is estimated
that approximately 6900 persons have been seen for dengue in clinics. Since
week 48, 2005, 1981 dengue cases have been confirmed by laboratory tests.
The recent introduction the NS1 test lead to modifying methods, such that
the final results need to be considered incomplete since week 18, 2006.
Because of this, it is not possible to follow the progression of the
epidemic course by biological sampling alone. Since the start of the
epidemic, 4 deaths can be directly attributed to dengue, 3 of whom were
children (ages 7 months, 4 years, and 6 years), and a 64-year-old adult.
Suspected cases for Week 21, 2006:
From sentinel physicians:
The number of persons having consulted a town doctor is estimated at 300
(an estimate based on the number of clinical cases diagnosed by the
sentinel physicians and also partly on their activity). 18 percent of the
suspected cases are under 6 years of age.
From Health Centers:
23 cases reported. 26 percent of the suspected cases are under 6 years of age.
From the Medical Service of the Armed Forces in Guiana:
Three cases reported, of which 2 were in Cayenne, and one in Saint Jean.
Emergency Rooms and Medical Watch in Cayenne:
336 persons received consultation for suspected dengue. Eight percent of
the suspected dengue cases lead to hospitalization.
From the Emergency Medical Assistance Service (SAMU):
SAMU received 31 calls for suspected dengue, representing 5 percent of all
calls (for the week).
Hospitalizations (for confirmed cases of dengue):
Since the beginning of the epidemic, there were 162 confirmed cases of
confirmed dengue requiring hospitalization: 17 percent for hemorrhagic
dengue, and 56 percent for severe non-hemorrhagic dengue. The distribution
by age group follows: 16 percent were under 5 years of age, 22 percent were
between the age of 5 and 14, and 62 percent were over 15 years of age or
more. Among those followed by laboratory means, thrombocytopenia was noted
in 77 percent, and 63 percent had a very profound thrombocytopenia. A
significant increase in hematocrit was found in 30 percent of the cases (53
percent of these increases were greater than 20 percent of the reference
value). Furthermore, 20 percent presented with serious bleeding.

Fiji declares state of medical emergency
---------------------------------------------
Health authorities in Fiji have declared a state of medical emergency
following an outbreak of diarrhea, which has claimed the lives of 4 children.
A senior health ministry spokesman, Dr. Joe Koroivueta, said the state of
medical emergency activated the response to a disease outbreak.
The health ministry is also maintaining a watch on an outbreak of dengue
fever and whooping cough, which have claimed lives in Samoa and Papua New
Guinea, in case a response is necessary in Fiji.
