According to the Santa Cruz SEDES [Departmental Health Services], 90 soldiers from the Santa Cruz Battalion have been placed under quarantine, and another 54 are hospitalized in the Santa Cruz city Pampa de la Isla Hospital.

With the report of the 2 deaths and the evacuation of 166 soldiers from the Bolivian Condors School (ESCONBOL) in Sanandita, located in the Tarija [department] municipality of Yacuiba, due to the hantavirus outbreak, the authorities of the Departmental Health Services (SEDES) carried out an epidemiological blockade in the locality. The Army regretted what has happened.

The Tarija SEDES Director, Paul Castellanos, stated that the laboratory tests confirmed the cause of death of the 1st soldier, but indicated that the cause of the 2nd death "is yet to be confirmed, although the symptoms are similar." There is also a 3rd case in intensive care in the Incor Hospital in Santa Cruz.

The Army General Commander in a communique regretted the deaths of the 2 "young soldiers" and explained that when they presented with symptoms, they were carrying out military instruction activities. They were evacuated immediately to Santa Cruz. Now, help is being provided to their families.

Castellanos explained that they carried out the 1st search in the area where there was evidence of the long-tailed rodents, the main transmitters of the disease [virus].

"Due to this, they have recommended the total evacuation of the place, because there are 9 patients hospitalized and more than 80 who have some symptoms. They are under quarantine," he said.

With these data "the outbreak" of the virus is confirmed in this zone where the disease was never [before] registered. "We have cases almost every year in Bermejo, but this is a new outbreak in Yacuiba," he stated.

The evacuated soldiers were taken to Santa Cruz department where they "are under observation."

Meanwhile in the camp, an epidemiological action was carried out that consists of a cleanup, fumigation, and the elimination of the long-tail mice.

Hantavirus [causes] a disease that is acquired by inhalation of feces and urine of the vector [reservoir], according to PAHO. It is characterized by patients that present with symptoms including fever, headache, gastrointestinal effects, respiratory difficulty, and hypotension.

The disease is contracted in rural areas such as forests, fields, among others, where rodents that carry the virus can be encountered.

The Santa Cruz SEDES Director, Marcelo Rios, stated that from Saturday [20 Apr 2019] until yesterday [21 Apr 2019], 167 soldiers were brought to this city to be placed under observation. "All are being monitored by military physicians and SEDES personnel," he stated.

He added that the majority are in the Army Battalion camp. "The 90 are in 2 battalion barracks. They do not have symptoms but are under observation in order to discard [detect?] any symptoms. Another 54 soldiers are in the Pampa de la Isla Hospital [in Santa Cruz city] where they are being watched over by military personnel. Also, there are 22 hospitalized in Cossmil.

In order to calm the [local] citizens, Rios stated that the movement of the affected individuals to Santa Cruz does not represent any risk of infection for the population, since [infection] only occurs due to the presence of the vector [reservoir].

In the La Asunta municipality in La Paz [department], 6 months ago a [health] emergency was declared due to the same disease in the camp of the Joint Task Force to eradicate surplus coca [cultivation]. There, 2 police died, and 17 were evacuated due to intoxication [infection?].

Meanwhile, the Army arranged for all the personnel that had changed their destination in recent weeks to present themselves in the Isolation Centers prepared in La Paz, Cochabamba and Trinidad, to monitor their health.

Tasks to be done given the new cases:
- Searches: According to the investigations carried out by the Tarija SEDES, in the military camp, the long-tailed mouse was found in the sector.
- Work: Currently, SEDES and Ministry of Health personnel carry out tasks together for cleanup and rodent control in the sector. This work will be done with all the precautionary measures necessary.
- Movement: A total of all the soldiers in Sanandita were evacuated via air in a Hercules airplane to Santa Cruz department.
- Transmission: SEDES investigates what could have been the cause of the transmission of the disease [virus]. It could have been by ingestion of food materials or water contaminated with urine or feces of the mouse or by raising and inhaling dust of contaminated soil.

[Cases of hantavirus infections in Tarija department are not new. Tarija department is endemic for hantaviruses, and cases occur there sporadically. Last year (2018), there were 11 cases. The previously reported 2015 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) that occurred in Tarija department were confirmed. As noted in the previous comments, earlier cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from tropical, lowland areas of Bolivia, including 7 cases in Tarija during 2014. The specific hantaviruses involved in these or previous cases in Bolivia were not given.

In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the rodent hosts of the hantavirus that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases, with their images, include the following:
- Laguna Negra virus (_Calomys laucha_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/images/Calomys%20laucha%20enciso%2031aug2011.jpg and _C. callosus_ https://eee.uci.edu/clients/bjbecker/PlaguesandPeople/Calomyscallosusb.jpg);
- Bermejo (Chaco rice rat _Oligoryzomys chacoensis_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/oligorizomyschacoensis.html); and
- Oran (_O. longicaudatus_ http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1203.jpeg).

Since previous cases in Tarija department have occurred in Bermejo, perhaps Bermejo hantavirus was involved. Since the military camp is in Sanandita, near the Argentina border in the Chaco ecosystem, perhaps Oran hantavirus with the long-tail rice rat host could be responsible.

Dr. Jan Clement earlier pointed out the need to be able to differentiate Seoul hantavirus, with its wide distribution around the world, from hantaviruses found in the Americas. - Mod.TY
