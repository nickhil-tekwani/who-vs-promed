Newcastle disease - 11 days on
-----------------------------------
The cull of pheasants at a farm in Surrey to stop the spread of Newcastle
Disease has been completed. The affected premises are now being cleansed
and disinfected.
Defra has continued to urge poultry keepers all over the country to stay
vigilant following the outbreak at the farm and to alert authorities if
their birds show suspicious symptoms.
However, there have been no other confirmed outbreaks of the disease
anywhere in the country. There has been no evidence of the disease
spreading from the original infected area or that infected birds have been
imported elsewhere in the UK.
Defra moved swiftly once samples taken from pheasants imported for shooting
from France proved positive for the disease on 15 Jul 2005. An Infected
Area around the outbreak was declared, imposing movement restrictions on
poultry and poultry products in order to limit any spread of disease. The
State Veterinary Service is carrying out surveillance in the area to detect
any signs of spread of disease.
The UK contacted the French authorities, who immediately began a thorough
investigation. There was a rapid exchange of information with the French
authorities, who identified a number of farms that had supplied birds to
the infected premises. Their investigations suggest that birds on one farm
have been exposed to the ND virus. Other EU Member States and the European
Commission have been kept informed and have not imposed any further trade
restrictions on either the UK or France.
The poultry industry, the NFU, shooting organisations and other
stakeholders have been kept closely informed since the disease was confirmed.

[An "Immediate notification report" on this outbreak was sent by the UK
authorities to the OIE on 16 Jul 2005 (see 20050718.2069). According to the
revised provisions of OIE's International Terrestrial Animal Health Code,
follow-up reports on a weekly basis should continue until the situation has
been resolved, either through the disease being eradicated or becoming
endemic, so that 6-monthly reporting will satisfy the obligation of the
country to the OIE. In any case, a final report on the incident should be
submitted. - Mod.AS]
