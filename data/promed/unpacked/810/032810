A man in New York developed an extremely rare and fatal brain disorder after he ate squirrel brains, according to a new report of the man's case.

In 2015, the 61-year-old man was brought to a hospital in Rochester, New York, after experiencing a decline in his thinking abilities and losing touch with reality, the report said. The man had also lost the ability to walk on his own.

An MRI of the man's head revealed a striking finding: The brain scan looked similar to those seen in people with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), a fatal brain condition caused by infectious proteins called prions. Only a few hundred cases of vCJD have ever been reported, and most were tied to consumption of contaminated beef in the United Kingdom in the 1980s and 1990s. [A human neurological disease known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob (CJD) is known to exist. "Mad cow disease" in cows is caused by a prion. When infected animals are consumed, the prion may be transmitted to humans. This particular strain of prion then infecting a human is a variant form of the neurological condition CJD, but because the source appears to have originated from cattle, it is called variant or new variant CJD. For a more complete explanation see the moderator comments below. - Mod.TG]

But in this case, the man had another dietary habit that could have raised his risk for vCJD: his family said he liked to hunt, and it was reported he had eaten squirrel brains, said Dr Tara Chen, a medical resident at Rochester Regional Health and lead author of the report. It's unclear if the man consumed the entire squirrel brain or just squirrel meat contaminated with parts of squirrel brain, Chen said.

Chen didn't treat the patient, but she uncovered the case while writing a report on suspected Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases seen at her hospital in the last 5 years.

The report was presented on 4 Oct 2018 at IDWeek, a meeting of several organizations focused on infectious diseases.

A rare brain disorder
---------------------
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects only about 1 in a million people each year worldwide, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It's a "debilitating disease" progressing quickly and usually results in death within 1 year of diagnosis, Chen told Live Science. There is no treatment or cure.

The disease results from prion proteins folding abnormally, leading to lesions in the brain.

There are 3 forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD): one that is inherited, one that comes from exposure to infected tissue from the brain or nervous system (this form includes vCJD), and one type is "sporadic" and does not appear to have a genetic or environmental cause.

The sporadic type is the most common, responsible for 85 percent of cases, according to the NIH.

Because CJD is so rare, doctors at Rochester Regional Health were surprised when 4 suspected cases of the disease occurred at the hospital within a 6-month period, from November 2017 to April 2018. That number is higher than expected based on the population of the Rochester area, which has about 1 million people, said study co-author Dr John Hanna, also a medical resident at Rochester Regional Health.

This high number of suspected CJD cases prompted Chen, Hanna, and colleagues to conduct a review of suspected CJD cases occurring at their hospital from 2013 to 2018. (5 cases were identified, but 2 of those 5 ultimately tested negative for CJD.)

That's when the doctors came across the case tied to squirrel brains. Tests indicated this was a "probable" case of vCJD because of the MRI finding and a test showing specific proteins in the patient's cerebrospinal fluid, which often indicate the disease.

However, CJD can be confirmed only with a test of brain tissue on autopsy at death. Although the patient passed away after his diagnosis, Chen and colleagues are working to obtain access to his medical records to see if CJD was confirmed at autopsy. If so, such a confirmation would be highly unusual; only 4 confirmed cases of vCJD have ever been reported in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The review of the 5 cases revealed a concerning finding: diagnosis of the condition was often delayed; in one case, about 2 weeks passed before doctors suspected a patient had CJD. In that case, the patient, a 65-year-old woman, had undergone plasmapheresis, a blood-filtering procedure, and a gynecological surgery before her diagnosis.

Quick diagnosis of CJD is important, because infectious prions could contaminate equipment used on patients with the disease, and this might transmit the condition to others if the equipment is not properly cleaned.

Diagnosis may be delayed, in part, because CJD is rare and is not "on the tip of the physician's mind" when assessing a patient, Hanna told Live Science. In addition, once doctors suspect CJD and order a cerebrospinal fluid test, it typically takes around 2 weeks to get the test results.

The report highlights the need for doctors to keep CJD diagnosis in mind and for hospitals to have "policies for infection control when it comes to CJD," Hanna said.

["Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare, degenerative, fatal brain disorder. It affects about one person in every one million per year worldwide; in the United States there are about 350 cases per year. CJD usually appears in later life and runs a rapid course. Typical onset of symptoms occurs at about age 60, and about 70 percent of individuals die within one year. In the early stages of the disease, people may have failing memory, behavioral changes, lack of coordination, and visual disturbances. As the illness progresses, mental deterioration becomes pronounced and involuntary movements, blindness, weakness of extremities, and coma may occur.

There are 3 major categories of CJD:
- In sporadic CJD, the disease appears even though the person has no known risk factors for the disease. This is by far the most common type of CJD and accounts for at least 85 percent of cases.
- In hereditary CJD, the person may have a family history of the disease and test positive for a genetic mutation associated with CJD. About 10 to 15 percent of cases of CJD in the United States are hereditary.
- In acquired CJD, the disease is transmitted by exposure to brain or nervous system tissue, usually through certain medical procedures. There is no evidence that CJD is contagious through casual contact with someone who has CJD. Since CJD was first described in 1920, fewer than one percent of cases have been acquired CJD. A type of CJD called variant CJD (or vCJD) can be acquired by eating meat from cattle affected by a disease similar to CJD called bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or, commonly, "mad cow" disease.

"CJD cannot be transmitted through the air or through touching or most other forms of casual contact. Spouses and other household members of people with sporadic CJD have no higher risk of contracting the disease than the general population. However, exposure to brain tissue and spinal cord fluid from infected persons should be avoided to prevent transmission of the disease through these materials.

"In some cases, CJD has spread to other people from grafts of dura mater (a tissue that covers the brain), transplanted corneas, implantation of inadequately sterilized electrodes in the brain, and injections of contaminated pituitary growth hormone derived from human pituitary glands taken from cadavers. Doctors call these cases that are linked to medical procedures iatrogenic cases. Since 1985, all human growth hormone used in the United States has been synthesized by recombinant DNA procedures, which eliminates the risk of transmitting CJD by this route."

This is not the 1st case of squirrel brains producing what appears to be vCJD. The Lancet reported a case of squirrel brain vCJD from Kentucky in 1997 (see https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)63333-8):

"Spongiform encephalopathies have been reported in a variety of large and small mammals.

"While conducting a study of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in south Florida, one of us (JRB) observed an affected patient who was originally a native of Kentucky and had a history of eating squirrel brains. Dietary transmission of prion diseases has been documented experimentally in animals and in human beings who are cannibals. Several case reports have suggested the possibility of transmission of CJD by consumption of brains of wild animals.

"These observations, together with recent concerns about the transmission of a unique encephalopathy in man believed to be related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy led us to examine the possible association of eating squirrel brains with CJD in rural Kentucky, where eating squirrel and other small game is not uncommon.

"Culinary preparations include scrambling the brains with eggs or putting them in a meat and vegetable stew referred to as 'burgoo'."

Perhaps it is wise to remember that consumption of any brain matter likely presents significant risk of some type of neurological disease. - Mod.TG
