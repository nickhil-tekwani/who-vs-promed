The West Nile [WN] virus infection morbidity is declining in Volgograd
oblast, where most of the cases were registered this year [2010]. The
total number of West Nile virus infection cases in Russia reached 480
this year. Rospotrebnadzor [Russian Federal Agency for Protection of
Customer Rights and Human Welfare] has reported 50 cases registered
during last week and 8 just yesterday [22 Sep 2010]. The majority of
cases were registered in Volgograd oblast (393), 53 cases in Rostov
oblast, 25 in Voronezh, 6 in Astrakhan and one in each: Kalmykia,
Krasnodar and Chelyabinsk.

Most of the cases were of moderate severity (353), only 26 cases were
severe and 92 cases were mild. The local authorities in Volgograd
confirm the decline of morbidity and note that preventive measures
facilitated the decline. The prevention measures included treatment of
water bodies against mosquitoes. The specialists consider that the
current outbreak of West Nile virus infection is due to abnormally hot
weather. There is also a cyclic feature in yearly morbidity. A similar
outbreak occurred in Volgograd 11 years ago, but then only Volgograd
city was affected, unlike now.

[The number of encephalitis cases has increased from 294 in the
Volgograd region on 14 Sep 2010 to 393 in the current report, 9 days
later. The onset of colder weather should happen soon, reducing WNV
vector mosquito populations and virus transmission.
