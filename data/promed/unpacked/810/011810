Midges that carry bluetongue -- the disease closely related to the
deadly African horse sickness -- may have carried a new strain of the
disease to the northern shores of Australia, evidence suggests.

However, there is no evidence of disease and the result was picked up
as part of a standard animal-monitoring programme.

Australia has filed a report with the World Organisation for Animal
Health (OIE) in respect of the single positive test result, which
occurred among a herd of 24 sentinel cattle. (The report is available
at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6964>.)

Dr Jill Mortier, who sent the report, said it is believed the
infected vectors are periodically blown to Australia by monsoonal
winds.

The positive result was confirmed by a 2nd laboratory.

Dr Mortier reported that bluetongue serotypes 1, 3, 9, 15, 16, 20,
21, and 23 had previously been isolated in Northern Australia cattle.
This was the 1st time serotype 7 had been isolated.

The positive result was on a farm near Humpty Doo [Northern Territory].

Bluetongue is a disease of sheep and cattle. The midges that spread
it can also carry the closely related African horse sickness.

Bluetongue is present in many countries worldwide, with various
strains having been present in the Mediterranean area for some time.
In 2006, a new strain, bluetongue serotype 8, began to circulate in
northern European countries such as Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg,
Holland, and France. In 2007, it appeared for the 1st time in
Britain, in East Anglia.

African horse sickness has spread north from Africa and has caused
horse deaths in several European countries. It has a high fatality
rate and is considered a major disease threat to northern European
horses, which have never been exposed to it.

Bluetongue is an infectious, noncontagious, arthropodborne viral
disease primarily of domestic and wild ruminants. Infection with
bluetongue virus is common worldwide but is usually subclinical or
mild in most infected ruminants.

Bluetongue virus is the type-species of the genus _Orbivirus_ in the
family _Reoviridae_. There are 24 serotypes worldwide, although not
all serotypes exist in any one geographic area. Distribution
throughout the world parallels the spatial and temporal distribution
of vector species of _Culicoides_ biting midges, which are the only
significant natural transmitters of the virus. Of more than 1400
_Culicoides_ species worldwide, fewer than 20 are actual or possible
vectors of bluetongue virus. Continued cycling of the virus among
competent _Culicoides_ vectors and susceptible ruminants is critical
to viral ecology.

In Australia the principal vector is _C. brevitarsis_, while in
Africa, Europe, and the Middle East it is _C. imicola_. In each
geographic region, secondary vector species may attain local
importance.

Vectors become infected with bluetongue virus by imbibing blood from
infected vertebrates; transovarial transmission has not been
reported. High affinity of the virus to blood cells, especially the
sequestering of viral particles in invaginations of RBC (red blood
cell) membranes, contributes to prolonged viremia in the presence of
neutralizing antibody. The extended viremia in cattle (up to 9
weeks), and the host preference of most vector species of
_Culicoides_ for cattle, provides a mechanism for year-round
transmission in domestic ruminants.

Mechanical transmission by other bloodsucking insects is of minor
significance. Bluetongue virus is not contagious, and concentrations
in secretions and excretions are minimal, making oral or aerosol
transmission unlikely. However, semen from viremic bulls can serve as
a source of infection for cows through natural service or artificial
insemination. Embryo transfer is regarded as safe, provided that
donors are not viremic and an appropriate washing procedure for
embryos is used. Accidental infection has been reported in dogs in
the USA following administration of a modified live virus vaccine
that was contaminated with the virus. Serologic evidence of infection
with bluetongue virus has been found in large carnivores in Africa,
perhaps as a result of ingesting virus-infected viscera.

The pathogenesis of bluetongue in cattle seems to differ from that in
sheep and is based on immediate IgE hypersensitivity reactions.
Clinical signs in cattle are rare but may be similar to those seen in
sheep. They are usually limited to fever, increased respiratory rate,
lacrimation, salivation, stiffness, oral vesicles and ulcers,
hyperesthesia, and a vesicular and ulcerative dermatitis. Susceptible
cattle and sheep infected during pregnancy may abort or deliver
malformed calves or lambs. The malformations include hydranencephaly
or porencephaly, which results in ataxia and blindness at birth.

One of the most effective methods of combating the disease is with vaccination.

Australia has a strategy that has been in place since 1991. They are
well experienced with dealing with this disease. - Mod.TG
