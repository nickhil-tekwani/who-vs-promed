[The presence of West Nile virus (WNV) in Europe was first recorded in 1958. Since then, the virus has caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of human and equine disease, predominantly in Southern countries.

In Europe, WNV circulates in resident and migratory birds,. Despite its high virulence in birds in North America (especially crows), WNV circulates relatively harmlessly in the Old World, presumably reflecting co-evolution of virus and host over a long period (Gould E, Higgs S, Buckley A, Gritsun T. Potential arbovirus emergence and implications for the United Kingdom. Emerg Infect Dis. 2006; 12(4): 549-55; https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid1204.051010).

The crow infected by WNV reported here, however, was found dead. We do not have information about the signs and lesions of this crow, which could indicate whether the death of this animal was due to WNV.

This is the 1st report of WNV in Slovenia. A few years ago, mosquitoes sampled in adjacent regions (north eastern Italy) were found to be infected by the virus (Savini G, Capelli G, Monaco F, et al. Evidence of West Nile virus lineage 2 circulation in Northern Italy. Vet Microbiol. 2012; 158(3-4): 267-73. doi: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.02.018; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.02.018). - Mod.PMB
