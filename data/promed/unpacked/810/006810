Public health agency THL has reported a rapid rise in the number of cases of Pogosta disease -- a mosquito-borne viral infection with flulike symptoms that is unique to Finland -- during autumn this year [2021]. In the middle of last month [September 2021], the agency recorded 151 infections, but this number had jumped significantly, to 467, by mid-October [2021].

Some 83 cases have been found in blood tests carried out in Eastern Finland's North Savo region, which is the highest number of regional infections detected so far. There have also been 65 cases registered in Central Finland, 64 in North Ostrobothnia and 56 in the Pirkanmaa region.

The last time such high numbers of the virus were detected nationwide was nearly 20 years ago, when 597 infections were recorded. "This is now clearly a 'Pogosta year'," professor of virology at the University of Helsinki Olli Vapalahti told Yle.

The disease tends to be cyclical, meaning cases remain very low for about 7 years and then there are suddenly hundreds of cases in one year. The highest number of infections ever recorded in Finland was in 1995, when more than 1300 cases were diagnosed.

Pogosta disease is caused by a virus that is transmitted through a mosquito bite, and the symptoms usually include a rash, mild fever and other flulike effects -- but in more extreme cases can lead to a painful arthritis. The disease was first detected in 1974 in the North Karelian village of Ilomantsi, located on Finland's eastern border with Russia, and the word "pogosta" derives from the Russian term for the area around the village church.

[The above report indicates that a Pogosta disease outbreak is again occurring in Finland. As a previous post noted, citing a published report, Sindbis virus (SINV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus (of the family Togaviridae), present in Eurasia, Africa, and Oceania. Antibodies to SINV are detected in humans in various geographical areas, but clinical infections caused by SINV are reported mostly from Finland where SINV is associated with fever, rash, and arthritis, known as Pogosta disease (see Sindbis virus - Finland 20100114.0173).

In the ProMED post of 22 Sep 1995, in addressing these "Sindbis-like" viruses, Dr. Charles Calisher pointed out that Karelian fever, Ockelbo, and Pogosta viruses are sufficiently different to give them different names, and that the diseases that they produce are more severe than that caused by prototype Sindbis virus (see Sindbis virus - Finland (2) 19950922.0870). - Mod.TY
