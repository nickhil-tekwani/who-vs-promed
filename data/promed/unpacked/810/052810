The family of a 4-year-old girl who died from [enterohemorrhagic] _E. coli_ infection suspects watermelon might have been the source of the bacteria, after swapping stories with the families of 2 other kids who also ate watermelon and also ended up in the hospital with the same infection.

An aunt of the girl who died said her niece ate watermelon purchased from the same Walmart in Lebanon [Linn County, Oregon] as the 2 other children who also fell ill with _E. coli_ -- a 5-year-old and a 3-year-old.

The families started sharing stories about the events leading up to when their children fell ill before both were rushed to Doernbercher Children's Hospital in Portland, Oregon with kidney failure.

"We have also contacted our suppliers and they have not received any watermelon illness complaints," said Brian Nick, Director of Walmart's National Media Relations. Nick said he 1st learned about the concern after watching a KATU story several days earlier. Nick said he checked for complaints early in the week and then checked again after our request Thursday, 18 Sep 2014.

Jonathan Modie, spokesman for the Oregon Public Health Division, said the state works with the respective county health department whenever _E. coli_ is reported, but would not comment further, citing an Oregon confidentiality law. Modie said the law precludes the state from talking about the families or the on-going investigation.

On Wednesday, 17 Sep 2014, health officials cleared a restaurant that the families also suspected may have the source where 2 of the children shared a turkey sandwich.

"All of the test results have come back negative and our comprehensive investigation of the establishment did not reveal a link to the reported case," said Amy Chapman, Lincoln County Environmental Health Program.

Full statement from Oregon Public Health Division Spokesman to KATU:

"Oregon law regarding confidentiality of information submitted to public health authorities precludes us from confirming, refuting or discussing details of specific cases related to identifiable individuals. It also precludes us from discussing details of ongoing investigations.

The routine response of public health officials to reports of illness is to interview patients, family members and close contacts of cases to ascertain potential sources of exposure to illness-causing bacteria; and to investigate and control any sources of potential outbreaks.

In the case of _E. coli_ O157 and related bacteria, such potential sources would include high-risk foods such as undercooked meat, unpasteurized milk or juices, restaurants at which cases have eaten, exposure to live animals, recreational water, and exposure to child care centers.

We have no new information to report on _E. coli_ at this time. When we do, we will let you know."

The law Modie is referencing is ORS 433.008(1)(a).

The restaurant where 2 children shared a sandwich isn't responsible for the _E. coli_ that killed one and hospitalized another, health officials said. Rebecca C. Austen, the Lincoln County [Oregon] Public Health Division director, said lab tests indicate the Roadhouse 18 Bar & Grill was not responsible for the _E. coli_ that infected 2 children, one of whom died.

"All of the test results have come back negative and our comprehensive investigation of the establishment did not reveal a link to the reported case," said Amy Chapman, Lincoln County Environmental Health Program Manager.

[At this time, there is no available DNA fingerprinting to link the 3 cases in the Pacific Northwest together and whether the recent Kentucky cases are related. The source of the outbreak (or outbreaks) remains unclear. - Mod.LL
