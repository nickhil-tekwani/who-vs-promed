Nepal has found a patient from Damak, eastern Nepal, to be a
suspected case of human bird flu infection, the Nepali national news
agency RSS reported on Sunday [25 Jan 2009]. Damak of Jhapa district
is some 320 km east of the Nepali capital Kathmandu. In mid-January
2009, the 1st case of bird flu in poultry was detected in Kakarbhitta
of the same district.

According to the report, bird flu has been suspected to have infected
a patient from Damak, who was taken to nearby BP Koirala Institute
for Health Sciences (BPKIHS) in Dharan. Communication spokesperson
for BPKIHS Bijay Rimal said bird flu virus has been suspected to have
been found in the patient's blood sample during tests in the
institute's laboratory. He said the patient's blood sample has been
sent for further tests in a sophisticated laboratory. He said the
patient was showing symptoms of bird flu infection. The BPKIHS,
however, did not reveal where the patient's blood sample had been sent.

Rimal, however, said it cannot be officially confirmed whether the
patient is infected with bird flu yet as the institute lacked a
specific lab to test bird flu. The patient has been referred to
Dharan by Lifeline Hospital in Damak following 3-day treatment there.

With panic spreading among the public about bird flu, Nepali
authorities confirmed Sunday [25 Jan 2009] no person has been
infected with the virus, and the virus has not spread in the capital
Kathmandu, local media reported. Director of the BP Koirala Institute
of Health Science Dr BP Das rebuffed the rumors that 2 persons being
treated at the hospital were infected with the avian virus (H5N1). He
clarified that the 2 were admitted into the hospital 3 days ago after
being infected with pneumonia, not bird flu, eKantipur.com reported.

Dr. Das claimed that the media had unnecessarily created false rumors
that the 2 patients had contracted the virus. He also reported that
the hospital had already contacted the government for the provision
of additional manpower, tools and medicines, keeping in view the
possible outbreak of avian flu in people. He added that the hospital
has made preparations for a separate "Tropical Ward" for the
treatment of avian flu, if needed.

Likewise, the government has confirmed that the avian virus has not
been detected in the capital so far. Spokesperson at the Ministry of
Agriculture and Cooperatives Hari Dahal said: "A few chickens died in
the capital recently. We are carrying out the tests, but it has not
been confirmed yet as to whether the chickens died of the avian
virus. After carrying out preliminary tests in Nepal, samples have
been sent to the United Kingdom for confirmation," he said.

The government on 16 Jan 2009 confirmed the outbreak of bird flu
virus in the eastern district of Jhapa.

[A map of the administrative regions of Nepal is available at:
<http://ncthakur.itgo.com/map04.htm>. Jhapa district where the
suspected human case originated is also where the 1st confirmed
outbreak of avian A/H5N1 influenza in poultry occurred. It lies about
300 km to the east of the capital Kathmandu, where the 1st 2
suspected human cases, now discounted, were treated.

Further information is awaited on the outcome of laboratory diagnosis
of the clinical samples from the Jhapa patient, more likely to test
positive due to the proximity of the outbreak of disease in poultry.
