One person has died of suspected anthrax and another hospitalised in Kisumu, officials say. The disease was reported in Mowlem, Kisumu County government said in a statement released Friday morning [12 Jul 2019].

"We have cases of suspected anthrax in the county. Two people were admitted to the hospital Thursday [11 Jul 2019], and one has since died," Dr Jonathan Billis, health officer in Kisumu Central Sub-county, said.

Dr Billis called on all health workers in the county to be on high alert for patients exhibiting symptoms such as sores, swellings, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pains. He urged locals to watch out for signs and symptoms, including face inflammation, breathing problems, and unexplained wounds.

Anthrax is caused by _Bacillus anthracis_ bacterium. It affects livestock, wild animals, and humans and can kill within 24 hours.

[This news report has no information on any possible identified source for these 2 suspected human cases. It is interesting that Dr. Jonathan Billis, Kisumu County health officer, has not instructed his people and the county veterinary officer to look for sick livestock. If you don't stop this disease in livestock, it just continues to appear in careless humans eating contaminated meat from sick and dead animals. Treating humans is very expensive. Burning infected carcasses and vaccinating livestock is much cheaper and more effective. Logic would say that the source is a villager's herd in Mowlem.

For a description of Kisumu County, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kisumu_County. Kisumu County is located in western Kenya, far from the nation's capital. The city of Kisumu, on the shores of Lake Victoria, has historically functioned as a major center of western Kenya commerce. Because of its location along Africa's largest lake, the area is ideally situated for fishing and fish processing, but the central government has long controlled key concessions on the lake, and economic development has left many of the inhabitants behind. Fishing, sugarcane farming, and rice farming are the county's principal industries. - Mod.MHJ
