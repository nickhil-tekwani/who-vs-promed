1st record of a Hop stunt viroid variant on Nagpur mandarin and
Mosambi sweet orange trees on rough lemon and Rangpur lime rootstocks
-----------------------------------------------
P. Ramachandran <viroidram@yahoo.co.in>, Plant Virology Unit,
Division of Plant Pathology, Indian Agricultural Research Institute,
New Delhi - 110012, India; J. Agarwal (as for Ramachandran); A. Roy,
Plant Virus Lab., Division of Crop Protection, Central Research
Institute for Jute and Allied Fibres, Barrackpore, Kolkata - 700 120,
India; D. K. Ghosh, NRC for Citrus, Nagpur, India; D. R. Das (as for
Ramachandran); and Y.S. Ahlawat (as for Ramachandran). Accepted for
publication 22 Dec 2004.
Citrus rootstocks play a very significant role in tree health and
productivity. The sub-viral pathogens, viroids, pose a major threat
to trees and susceptible rootstocks resulting in a slow decline
(Ahlawat, 1997).
In a survey of citrus orchards in certain parts of Central India,
symptoms of bark scaling, bark splitting and leaf yellowing were
observed on Nagpur mandarin (_C. reticulata_) (7 plants) and mosambi
(_C. sinensis_) (10 plants) grafted on rough lemon and Rangpur lime
rootstocks.
Following grafting of scions from all these plants onto Etrog Citron
(_C. medica_), an indicator host for Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd),
an unusual symptom of reduced size and yellowing of newly emerging
leaves developed. This prompted further investigation.
Electrophoresis under denaturing conditions of total nucleic acid
extracted from the grafted Etrog citron plants with symptoms
indicated the presence of viroid-like low molecular weight (LMW) RNA
in all samples. These RNAs were used in RT-PCR using a set of citrus
viroid-specific primers (Ramachandran et al., 2003).
Amplicons of ca. 300 bp were obtained in all the samples with primers
specific to Hop stunt viroid (HSVd), but none were observed with CEVd
specific primers. Cloning and sequencing of these amplicons
identified a viroid RNA (Acc. No. AY237168) with 100 percent sequence
similarity to HSVd-Ca905 (Acc. No. AF131250; Reanwarakorn & Semancik,
1999) and HSVd-ycv (Acc. No. AJ490824; Roy & Ramachandran, 2003).
This constitutes the 1st isolation of a HSVd isolate (HSVd-RL) from
citrus rootstocks showing bark scaling and splitting symptoms in
Central India. This result suggests that HSVd is also a component in
producing bark-scaling symptoms in rootstocks, which were previously
considered to be due to CEVd-infection alone.
This report indicates the need for the testing of citrus plants for
HSVd in budwood certification and germplasm evaluation.

[There are 2 significant aspects to this report. First, the
suggestion that both HSVd and CEVd are involved in disease
pathogenesis, contrary to the prevailing belief that CEVd alone
caused the disease. Second -- and possibly more significant -- is the
need to test for HSVd in germplasm evaluation and certification
schemes. Disease management depends upon sterilizing pruning shears
with bleach before moving to the next tree. This report emphasizes
the need for modern techniques for detection of viroids in citrus,
especially since viroid-infected trees often show no symptoms.
