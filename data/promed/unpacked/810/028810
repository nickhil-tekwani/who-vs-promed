A viral fever of unknown origin has hit the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, resulting in 68 deaths, including of 40 children, within the past week, The Times of India reported on Monday [30 Aug 2021].

Twelve children are among the reported fatalities who died from the fever in the past 24 hours in the Firozabad district, according to the health ministry.

"The situation in the districts is alarming," a member of the legislative assembly of Firozabad, Manish Asija, was quoted by The Times of India as saying. Asija added that "waterlogging, lack of sanitation and hygiene are the reasons behind the disease spread."

Most fever carriers suffered from high temperature, dehydration and a low platelet count. Some patients died during treatment, and others showed symptoms of dengue fever. State hospitals were running out of beds with blood banks running dangerously low.

The causes of the deaths are being studied, medical experts told the newspaper. The situation is aggravated by the high humidity amid severe heat in the region, creating a favorable environment for the spread of viral diseases.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday [30 Aug 2021] visited some dengue patients in the Firozabad district [Uttar Pradesh] where around 40 people, mostly children, have died in a week, and said teams will be formed to ascertain the cause of the deaths. Commenting on the situation, chief minister Yogi Aditynath said, "Till now, 32 children and 7 adults have died," adding that instructions have been issued to officials to ensure treatment of every patient at government hospitals.

"The death of children will be probed by a team from King George's Medical University in Lucknow and a surveillance team so that the reasons can be ascertained," he said.

Meanwhile, in the wake of the current situation, authorities have ordered the closure of schools (for classes 1 to 8) in the district till 6 Sep [2021].

The chief minister told reporters on Monday [30 Aug 2021] that the 1st case was detected on 18 Aug [2021], and family members of patients started their treatment in private hospitals and clinics.

"As the district administration came to know about the fever, a paediatric isolation ward was set up...where the death of 3 children was reported in the past 2 days. Two out of the 3 children were brought dead," he said.

Adityanath also said samples of some patients should be sent to the King George's Medical University in Lucknow and the National Institute of Virology in Pune. He visited the 100-bed ward of the government hospital to meet the children affected by dengue and check the arrangements for their treatment. He warned officials of strict action against the laxity of any kind.

After visiting the hospital, the chief minister met the district magistrate, chief medical officer, additional director (health), and public representatives in the hospital's auditorium and gave necessary instructions to them to make proper arrangements for children's treatment and the prevention of dengue in the district. He also visited the Sudama Nagar from where most of the dengue cases were reported.

Divisional Commissioner Amit Gupta of Agra division had also toured the affected areas of Firozabad on Sunday [29 Aug 2021] afternoon and had given necessary instructions to the Health Department and Municipal Corporation officials and asked people to exercise caution.

BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] MLA [Member of the Legislative Assembly] [Manish] Asija on Sunday [29 Aug 2021] said more than 40 children have died in Firozabad due to dengue since 22-23 Aug [2021]. "This morning [29 Aug 2021], I received the sad news of (the death of) 6 children," he said.

For more than a week now, children in some districts in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh have been waking up with a high fever and drenched in sweat. Many of them complained of joint pains, headaches, dehydration and nausea. In some cases, they reported rashes spreading across legs and arms. At least 50 people, mostly children, have died of the fever, and several hundred have been admitted to hospital in 6 districts in the eastern part of the state. None of the dead tested positive for Covid-19.

At a time when India appears to be slowly recovering from a deadly 2nd wave of coronavirus, the deaths in Uttar Pradesh have provoked a rash of panicky headlines about a "mystery fever" sweeping through the countryside of India's most populous state. Physicians in a few of the affected districts - Agra, Mathura, Mainpuri, Etah, Kasganj and Firozabad - believe dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection, could be the main cause of deaths. They say many of the patients were taken to hospital with a declining platelet - a blood component which helps form clots - count, which characterises a severe form of dengue.

"The patients, especially children, in hospitals are dying very quickly," says Dr Neeta Kulshrestha, the most senior health official of Firozabad district, where 40 people, including 32 children, have died in the past week.

Transmitted by female mosquitoes, dengue is mainly a tropical disease and has been circulating in India for hundreds of years. It is endemic in more than 100 countries, but some 70% of the cases are reported from Asia. There are 4 dengue viruses, and children are up to 5 times more likely to die during a 2nd dengue infection than adults.

The mosquito - Aedes aegypti - breeds in and around houses in containers holding fresh water. "Humans provide breeding places and only humans can take them away," says Dr Scott Halstead, one of the world's leading experts on viruses spread by mosquitoes.

Nearly 100 million severe cases of dengue - severe bleeding, impaired organs - are reported worldwide every year. "The combined impact of Covid-19 and dengue epidemics can potentially result in devastating consequences for the populations at risk," according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Yet it is still not clear whether an epidemic of dengue is alone responsible for the fever-related deaths in Uttar Pradesh. A state with more than 200 million people and traditionally poor standards of sanitation, high levels of-malnutrition in children and patchy health care routinely reports such "mystery fever" cases after monsoon rains every other year.

Outbreaks of the mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis - 1st identified in Uttar Pradesh in 1978 - have claimed more than 6500 lives since. The disease mainly spread through Gorakhpur and adjoining districts which border Nepal in the foothills of the Himalayas, all low lying and prone to floods and providing a breeding ground for mosquitoes which transmit the virus. A vaccination campaign, which began in 2013, has led to a drop in cases, but children continue to die. 17 children have died of Japanese encephalitis in Gorakhpur so far this year [2021], and 428 cases have been recorded.

In 2014, reacting to increasing cases of children dying of encephalitis and myocarditis - inflammation of the heart muscle - scientists examined 250 afflicted children in Gorakhpur. They found that 160 of them had antibodies to the bacteria that caused scrub typhus. Scrub typhus, also known as bush typhus, is a bacterial infection spread through bites of infected viral mites. The mites settle on the thriving vegetation in the villages after monsoon rains. Scientists found the mites on firewood which villagers store inside their homes. A lot of the time, scrub typhus spreads when children handle firewood at home or defecate in the open in the bushes infested with the mites.

In a separate study, scientists also found scrub typhus and dengue were mainly responsible for post-monsoon fever cases in six districts in eastern Uttar Pradesh between 2015 and 2019. Another potentially fatal bacterial infection called leptospirosis transmitted from animals to humans, and chikungunya, a mosquito-borne disease, accounted for the other fever causing pathogens.

"So there was a bunch of fever-related diseases happening in the region after the monsoons ended. You need systemic surveillance to keep a track of these diseases and treat them," says V Ravi, a professor of virology at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuroscience (Nimhans), who led the 2nd study.

Earlier, in 2006, scientists investigated another "mystery" outbreak of fever-related deaths among children in Uttar Pradesh. This time they found that the children had died after consuming cassia beans, which grew abundantly in the western part of the state. This food poisoning was the result of "poverty, hunger, lack of parental supervision, ignorance, children playing by themselves, non-availability of toys and easy access to the plant", the scientists concluded.

Clearly, only more investigations and genome analysis will reveal whether the latest spate of "mystery fevers" in India are triggered by dengue alone, or a host of other diseases. This would mean training local clinics and hospitals in collecting samples of people suffering from fever and send them for genome testing to labs.

Also, there is no clear record of how these fevers began and progressed; and whether the severity of the condition was determined by the long, arduous journeys that people have to make to government hospitals for treatment. Or whether the afflicted children were suffering from other conditions such as tuberculosis.

If the cause of the mystery deaths is dengue alone, it points to the government's largely ineffective anti-mosquito control programmes. The intensity of transmission, according to Dr Halstead, can be only determined by antibody tests - called sero surveys - by age groups.

"If we don't investigate properly and regularly, a lot of things will continue to remain a mystery," says an Indian virologist, preferring to remain unnamed.

["Firozabad district forms one of the western districts of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, which has Firozabad Town as its district headquarters" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firozabad_district).

Dengue is a vector-borne disease, transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with one of the 4 dengue virus serotypes. It is endemic throughout India, mostly in metropolitan cities and towns.

The above report highlights a high number of cases in young children that merits further investigation. As there is no specific treatment for dengue/severe dengue/dengue hemorrhagic fever, early detection and provision of timely proper medical care can reduce fatalities to less than 1%. Maintenance of body fluid volume is critical to severe dengue care.

India's National Guidelines for Clinical Management of Dengue Fever can be found at https://nvbdcp.gov.in/WriteReadData/l892s/Dengue-National-Guidelines-2014.pdf.

To prevent or control dengue transmission, it is necessary to control mosquito vector density and/or interrupt human-vector contact. Mosquito source reduction and community awareness about vector-borne diseases are 2 important activities to control them. The WHO fact sheet including prevention and control measures for dengue can be accessed at https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue.

Guidelines for Integrated Vector Management for Control of Dengue/Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever are available at https://nvbdcp.gov.in/WriteReadData/l892s/dengue_1_Director_Desk_DGHS_meeting_OCT06.pdf. - Mod.UBA]

[It is unclear that dengue has been confirmed in all reported cases of this "mystery fever". Other possible etiologies should also be considered. The news report says the patients had fever and low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). Decreased platelet counts may be seen in certain bacterial and viral infections or after administration of drugs (e.g., heparin), in hematologic malignancy or severe sepsis, and in immunologic conditions, like idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, systemic lupus erythematosus, and the antiphospholipid syndrome. The causes of outbreaks of an infectious disease associated with thrombocytopenia include:
- Scrub typhus due to _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like bacterium spread by chiggers (larval mites);
- Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), a tick-borne infection caused by the SFTS virus, a novel phlebovirus;
- Dengue, caused by one of 4 serotypes of dengue virus, a _Flavivirus_, transmitted by _Aedes_ (_Ae. Aegypti_ or _Ae. Albopictus_) mosquitoes;
- Leptospirosis, caused by _Leptospira_ bacteria, spread by contact with water, frequently caused by flooding, contaminated by the urine of chronically infected animals, especially rats; and
- Hantavirus infection, caused by one of several hantaviruses (bunyaviruses), following exposure to aerosolized urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents or after exposure to dust from their nests.

The situation in the village where the outbreak occurred, described above as "waterlogging, lack of sanitation and hygiene," could facilitate spread of leptospirosis and mosquito-borne dengue. Rodent infestation could facilitate spread of leptospirosis and hantavirus infection. More information hopefully may be forthcoming following further investigation. - Mod.ML
