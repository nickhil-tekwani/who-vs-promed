[ProMED-mail posting "Avian influenza (47): China (Tibet), Kuwait,
Viet Nam 20070307.0805" included a request for information on the
breeding or domestication of bar-headed geese in China. The following
information, translated from Chinese websites, has been subsequently
received from Dan Silver who is gratefully acknowledged. - Mod.AS]

Below are a few pieces of information gathered from online
Chinese-language sources, in response to your request for information
about bar-headed goose breeding in China.
1. A write-up on the website 'Wetlands.cn' states that the National
Bird Banding Center of China has conducted research on bar-headed
geese and brown-headed gulls in Qinghai Lake Nature Reserve since
1985 and "in recent years the Management Office has undertaken
captive breeding, abandoned egg incubation experiments, research on
ecological habits, etc. of bar-headed geese."

2. 'Wetlands' further states the number of bar-headed geese in
Qinghai Lake and its surroundings was determined to be 5520 in a
1988-89 survey.
3. 'China Green Times' puts the number of bar-headed geese in Qinghai
Lake and its surroundings at 12 100 in an article dated 2 Feb 2007.

4. Articles from mid-2006, such as one from 'Chinabreed.com',
describe bar-headed goose meat farming as a nascent and potentially
lucrative niche for farmers in China.

5. An article on 'Chunming 888', a commercial agriculture website,
states that there are bar-headed goose farms in some parts of Tibet.
The article also states that bar-headed geese are rarely affected by
disease, making them well suited to commercial breeding with minimal
use of antibiotics.

bar-headed geese and if their breeding is carried out in facilities
that allow contact with wild, free roaming geese. - Mod.AS]
