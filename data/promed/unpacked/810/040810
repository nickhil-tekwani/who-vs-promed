Rural anthrax situation in Argentina, 2013
------------------------------------------
The author (Ramon Noseda) has been presenting reports on the situation of this zoonosis in Argentina since March 2003, when the 1st report was submitted to the OMS-WHO Anthrax Working Group, in Nice, France. Today, we present the events that occurred during the year 2013 in (1) the Assessment Area (1977-2013) and in (2) the Alert Zone, and responses to outbreaks of natural, accidental or deliberate occurrence of _Bacillus anthracis_ (1988-2012), and other parameters of interest.

In the 1st -- Area de Evaluation de Carbunclo Rural -- there were 8 districts (partidos) involved: Azul, Belgrano, Daireaux, Las Flores, Laprida, Madariaga, Olavarria, and Pila, with 14 outbreaks. We note that during the summer season, there were 8 focal points of epidemic nature in the districts of Laprida and Olavarria during 2 months, February and March, of intense local rain, high temperatures, and an explosive hatch of Tabanid biting flies. In 36 years of assessment, the normal percentage of samples from dead cattle with _B. anthracis_ identified is 11 percent (450+s/3964) but in 2013 it was 8 percent (14+s/175). The summer seasonal percentage distribution in 2013 was of 23 percent, compared to 18 percent normally; the recoveries during the rest of 2013 were between 2 percent and 4 percent of samples submitted. In the broader Alert and Response Zone, there was a Vet Alert but there were no humans involved. Anti-carbuncle (anthrax) voluntary vaccination together with foot-and-mouth disease vaccination was performed in 83 856 bovines with Sterne strain and applied by veterinarians. The 5 other similar Veterinary Diagnose Laboratories of similar characteristics identified 18 percent (15+s/94 samples) positive for _B. anthracis_; Laboratorio Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires Province, 16 negative samples; Laboratorio Regional Rauch, Ministerio de Asuntos Agrarios, Buenos Aires Province, 14 +/32 samples with positives in the partidos of Ayacucho, Azul, and Rauch; INTA Balcarce, Buenos Aires Province, 1+/2 samples relating to the Vidal partido; Laboratorio Biologico Tandil, Buenos Aires Province, 8 negative samples; Laboratorio Santa Rosa, La Pampa Province, 26 negative samples. Overall there were bovine anthrax outbreaks in 11 districts of the Province of Buenos Aires, all of which are included among the 53 anthrax affected districts reported in the period 1977-2012. The production of bovine Sterne anthrax vaccine was of 16 648 530 units. Cutaneous anthrax was diagnosed in 13 people, 7 of which were in the Province of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe (4), Mendoza (1), and Tierra del Fuego (1). The epidemic situation of Rural Carbuncle in Argentina during the term 1977-2013 has not changed. The control and surveillance procedures are fully in place, but the ongoing endemic state is the result of a negligent failure of the bovine community to vaccinate their stock.

[Yet again, we must thank Ramon for his excellent annual report on the state of anthrax in Argentina. I know that they struggle hard to get the herd owners in the high-risk districts in Buenos Aires Province to vaccinate their stock, but the lazy ones ably demonstrate the persistence of this pathogen in the optimum black soil habitat of this province. These ongoing cases just recontaminate their soils and undo any natural spore die off that has occurred.
