No step has so far been taken in Dhaka city to identify the cattle
infected with anthrax. The deadly disease has been spreading in
Sirajganj and Pabna districts through which most of the cattle were
brought to the capital.

The Dhaka City Corporation (DCC), which manages the capital's cattle
markets and is responsible for checking and certifying the meat sold
in the city areas, is depending on livestock department to tackle the
issue, said DCC health department official Azmat Ali. Many believe
the indifference of DCC to the issue has posed a threat to lives of
the city dwellers. According to Azmat, an anthrax infected cow died
recently at Nayabazar in Dhaka before slaughtering.

Mohammad Sohel, manager of city's largest Gabtoli cattle market, told
bdnews24.com that everyday 30 to 50 trucks of cattle come to the
market from the country's northern region where the anthrax-hit 2
districts fall. He said the leaseholder of the market planned to
request the DCC authorities to check the cattle.

But Azmat said the city corporation has no plan to check the cattle.
He said: "Livestock department is supposed to tackle the issue. There
is a livestock department officer deputed at DCC for the matter."
Azmat said other than the Nayabazar case no anthrax-infected cattle
were found in the capital.

According to health experts, anthrax is an acute disease caused by
the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. Most forms of the disease are
lethal, and it affects both animals and humans. There are effective
vaccines against anthrax, and some forms of the disease respond well
to antibiotic treatment. Azmat said anthrax causes blisters which can
be cured by taking antibiotics. ["Blisters"? The cutaneous lesions
consist of more than small vesicles. If caught early with
antibiotics, the lesions resolve fairly quickly. - Mod.MHJ]

[It would seem that the Dhaka City Corporation has still to get
adequately organised to prevent any anthrax infected animal being
picked up and transported to Dhaka, much less identified at the city
cattle market. - Mod.MHJ]
