[Hendravirus infection], a horse-borne disease potentially fatal to
humans, has killed a horse south of Brisbane.

A vet treating the horse at Kerry, near Beaudesert, contacted
Biosecurity Queensland and the state health department on Tuesday [28
Jun 2011] to report the death, News Ltd says.

The outbreak was confirmed by Queensland Health Minister Paul Lucas,
who said all measures were being taken to secure the site and ensure
the safety of those who had contact with the horse.

Since its discovery in Queensland in 1994, the virus has killed 30
horses and 4 humans.

8 people are feared to have been exposed to the potentially deadly
hendravirus after an infected horse died in southeast Queensland.

A vet who was wearing only gloves, and no mask, when he treated the
sick horse is among the people being tested. They have a long and
anxious wait, because hendravirus can take up to 3 weeks to incubate.

The bat-borne virus can spread among horses, who can in turn infect
humans who come into close contact with their respiratory secretions
or blood.

Acting chief health officer Dr Aaron Groves said all involved were
believed to have had a low to moderate level of exposure and were
showing no active signs of the virus so far. "The longest period of
time (to incubate) is 21 days after exposure," Dr Groves told
reporters today [29 Jun 2011]. "We are letting them know we'd like to
do the 2nd blood test within 21 days and another test after 6 weeks."

Two properties have been quarantined, after the horse fell ill while
at an agistment property [a place that boards & feeds horses for a
fee] at Kerry, near Beaudesert, on Saturday [25 Jun 2011]. The horse
died the following day, about 30 km [19 mi] south at Biddaddaba, after
the female owner took it home.

No other horse on either property has yet contracted the virus.
Queensland's chief vet, Dr Rick Symons, said the vet who assessed the
sick horse had shown great intuition to take a blood sample for a
hendravirus test. He said it showed vets were more aware of the deadly
disease following outbreaks over the past few years. "We certainly
encourage vets to test and we had well over a 100 meetings last year
[2011] talking to them and asking them to take tests," Mr Symons said.
"It's really good he took the test."

However, the vet wore only gloves when attending the horse. He should
have worn a facial mask and full body clothing, for full protection
from the virus.

Biosecurity Queensland is visiting both properties to determine the
horse's movements and what other horses it had contact with.

Queensland Horse Council president Debbie Dekker said the Beaudesert
area was a stronghold for all sectors of the horse industry. But she
expected the fallout from the latest outbreak to be limited to
affected properties. "It's a big horse area -- there's stockhorse
studs, Arab studs, pony clubbers, equestrian people, trail riders, and
thoroughbred studs as well," she said. "But it's only horses on the
affected properties that will be at risk, because hendravirus is not
very contagious and requires nose-to-nose contact. There'll be no
cancellation of horse events in the district or anything like that."

[Hendravirus infection] has a high death rate in humans -- 4 of the 7
confirmed human cases recorded since it surfaced in 1994 resulted in
death.

While the exact route of infection is not known, it's thought horses
may contract it by eating food contaminated by flying fox urine,
saliva, or birth fluids.

[The virus is believed to be spread by bats, and horses graze under
the trees where the bats may roost.

We hope the people are all cleared of the virus. While the
veterinarian is to be applauded for taking the blood sample, it should
serve as a stark reminder that personal protective gear is always
appropriate. We sincerely hope the veterinarian and people exposed
will be negative for this virus. - Mod.TG]
