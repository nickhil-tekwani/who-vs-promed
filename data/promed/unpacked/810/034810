During the period between 16 Jul-12 Aug [2009], Itabuna recorded a
suspected DHF death and 101 new cases of dengue, showing that the
disease continues to threaten the city. The Public [Works?] Ministry
has stated that its recommended actions have been ignored by city
hall, such as the cleaning of all canals of the city and local
[vector control] fighting in neighborhoods with high infestation of
the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_.

In 2009, Itabuna has had the greatest dengue epidemic in its history,
with more the 13 000 cases of this disease, as well as 8 confirmed
[dengue] fatalities and 4 [additional fatal cases] awaiting
confirmation by the Central Laboratory in Salvador. And there are
still 4 months to go until the end of 2009.

In the capital, cases rose 50 percent in the 1st half of 2009, from
214 to 322. According Bronislaw de Castro, coordinator of dengue
surveillance in the municipality, the increase is not representative.
In 2009 [incidence] was 2.9 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. The
Ministry of Health considers the transmission to be low up to 100
cases [per 100 000]. "Even in 2007, the incidence was 24.2 per 100
000. To have an epidemic in the city, it would take 33 000 cases in
the year," he said.

El Salvador's Health Ministry designated 26 Aug [2009] as its
national anti-dengue day since the number of confirmed dengue cases
has topped to 1145, up 36 percent year-on-year, according to news
reaching [Mexico City] on Friday [14 Aug 2009].

"We have made several plans to tackle dengue and flu. But the most
important one is to avoid mosquito breeding," said health minister
Eduardo Espinoza. Dengue fever is [caused by] a mosquito-borne
tropical virus that causes muscle pain, internal bleeding, and death.
The rainy season (May to October) increases the amount of stagnant
water, a breeding ground for dengue [virus]-carrying _Aedes_
mosquitoes, thus increasing the spread of dengue and flu. [_Aedes_
mosquitoes are not involved in the transmission of flu (influenza)
virus. - Mod.TY]

Guatemalan health officials on Tuesday [11 Aug 2009] confirmed that 2
people have died from DHF in the Caribbean province of Izabal, where
there were reports that at least 8 children died from the disease in
the past few weeks. An investigation conducted last week confirmed
that at least 2 people died from the disease in the region, the
Health Ministry said.

Dengue is a serious viral disease transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito that is characterized by high fever, intense headaches,
muscle pain, gastro-intestinal problems, and rashes. DHF, in addition
to having symptoms associated with classic dengue, like fever,
headaches, and joint pain, can also produce internal bleeding.

Opposition GANA [Grand National Alliance] party Congressman Byron
Chacon, who represents Izabal, said last Thursday [13 Aug 2009] that
8 children had died from DHF and 69 other people were infected with
the disease in his district. Health Minister Celso Cerezo said,
however, that 2 people had died and 16 others had been infected with
DHF, but they were all recovering.

A total of 115 cases of classic dengue have also been detected in
Izabal, health officials said. Dengue is common in Izabal, which does
not have drains, allowing the mosquitoes that spread the disease
[virus] to breed in standing water.

The number of dengue cases has risen to 22 757, while 232 people have
died of the disease in Sri Lanka so far, the Epidemiological Unit of
the Health Ministry said on Thursday [13 Aug 2009].

The Epidemiological Unit said in its latest statistics that of the 22
757 cases, the highest number of patients were reported from June
[2009], totaling 7050, followed by July [2009] with 6714 cases being
reported. This represents a sharp increase, as only 4156 dengue cases
and 85 deaths were reported for the whole of 2008.

Health officials said the majority of these cases have been reported
from the areas of Gampaha, Kegalle, Kandy, and Colombo.

The rapid rise has forced the health authorities to carry out an
extensive public awareness campaign to eradicate the mosquito-based epidemic.

Households have been warned to keep the environment free of
mosquitoes. Those who allow the mosquitoes to breed by allowing water
to stagnate face prosecution, with a special hotline being made
available for public information.

[Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease of humans
that in recent years has become a major international public health
concern. Transmitted by the main vector, the _Aedes aegytpi_
mosquito, there are 4 distinct but closely related viruses that cause
dengue. Globally, 2.5 billion people live in areas where dengue
viruses can be transmitted.

There is good evidence that sequential infection increases the risk
of more serious disease, resulting in dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).
DHF was 1st recognized in the 1950s during the dengue epidemics in
the Philippines and Thailand, see
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/dengue/en/index.html>.

Normally, dengue outbreaks tend to increase in numbers of cases and
deaths reported in rainy seasons. As the southwestern monsoon in Sri
Lanka starts from May to August, it is possible that the dengue
outbreak is still going on. More dengue outbreaks are also possible
in November to February when the northeast monsoon begins.

Although the number of dengue cases should be declining because we
are in the last month of the southwestern monsoon, the number of
dengue cases seems to be rapidly increasing in Sri Lanka. There have
been 5 fatalities and 1012 new dengue cases reported since 9 Aug 2009
(see prior ProMED-mail Dengue/DHF update 2009 (32) 20090811.2864).

According to the newswire above, this is the largest dengue outbreak
(22 757 cases and 232 fatalities) in Sri Lanka between 2004 and 2009.
In 2004, there were large outbreaks of dengue in Sri Lanka that
caused 15 467 cases and 88 deaths reported. In 2006 there was another
dengue outbreak in Sri Lanka, which caused 11 972 cases and 48
deaths, see <http://web.gideononline.com> (requires subscription).

With 32 suspected dengue cases already recorded in Phuentsholing as
of [8 Aug 2009], health officials say that the number of dengue
victims might rise, unless residents take responsibility to keep
their toilets and surroundings clean.

Officials of the vector-borne disease control unit in Phuentsholing
said that dengue cases were suspected to be from in-house breeding.
Unlike the nocturnal malaria-transmitting mosquito, which breeds in
dirty water, the dengue mosquitoes (_Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes
albopictus_) breed in clean water and bites during the day. "Most
residents in Phuentsholing are storing water in their bathroom for
more than a week, which gives mosquitoes place for in-house
breeding," said the Dzongkhag malaria supervisor in Phuentsholing
hospital, Dr Wangchuk. He said that the water should be emptied and
refilled at least after every 4-5 days so that in-house breeding does
not happen. "But people don't listen, saying that they face
unexpected water shortage at times," he said.

Dengue cases in Phuentsholing are expected to cross last year's
[2008] record of 35 reported and cured cases, officials said. 7 cases
were reported from Pasakha, 5 from the Indian border town of Jaigoan
and 13 cases were from the Phuentsholing municipal area, comprising
the RICBL colony, Karate and RBP colony.

Although records show that most dengue patients were from the Pasakha
area, officials found that these victims work in Pasakha but live in
the Indian border town of Jaigoan. "Many cases were also reported
from an area called the Chinese line in Jaigoan, which is located
behind the revenue and customs head office in Phuentsholing," said
one health official.

Officials said that there is a high chance of dengue in the border
town because of poor sanitation, drainage and waste system, which
provided fertile grounds for mosquito breeding.
