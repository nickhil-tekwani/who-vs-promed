Dengue hemorrhagic fever has claimed at least 4 lives here this year, the
head of the regency's ministry of health office, Muchtadi, disclosed on
Thursday. He said his office recorded a total of 136 cases, most of them
affecting women and children. The dengue cases have been found in 39 of the
130 subdistricts in Kudus, home to the cigarette industry of Central Java.
The health office identifies Kaliwangu, Kota and Undaman districts as the
most dengue fever-prone areas in the regency. The subdistricts have been
fumigated.

[More and more, dengue reminds me of the movie "Groundhog Day". This is not
an emerging disease, it has emerged. It is rampant throughout tropical and
subtropical areas of the world and whether the Top Down or Bottom Up
approach has been tried, it has failed. This disease should be nearly as
easy to eradicate as was smallpox, but we need a vaccine, desperately. It
may be that all the epidemiologic research that has been conducted has been
in the wrong direction and that a completely new paradigm is required. -
