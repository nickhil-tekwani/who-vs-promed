Results of our molecular studies indicate that the dengue-2 virus
responsible for the current outbreak in Western Samoa is closely related to
dengue-2 viruses isolated earlier this year in other Pacific Island
countries. The nucleotide sequence of dengue-2 virus isolates from Western
Samoa shows 100% homology in the E/NS1 region with dengue-2 virus isolates
from an outbreak in the Cook Islands in February of this year.

Our previous postings, reporting results of collaborative studies with Dr.
Eliane Chungue [Tahiti, showed close similarities between the dengue-2
virus isolates from the Cook Islands, Tahiti and New Caledonia. Of interest
is the finding that the nucleotide sequence of the E gene protein of
dengue-2 virus isolates from an outbreak in Australia in early 1997 was
significantly different from the dengue-2 virus circulating in Pacific
Island countries.
