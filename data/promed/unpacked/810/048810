The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is recalling a brand of salami sold in Nova Scotia due to concerns over botulism. The agency says the caraway-pepper salami sold by Webbersfood Ltd. is being pulled from store shelves because it may permit the growth of the dangerous bacteria.

The meat was sold unlabeled at the Historic Farmers' Market in the Brewery Square in Halifax on 9 Apr 2016. The agency says there have been no reported illnesses linked to the salami. It says the meat should be thrown out or returned to the store where it was purchased.

Food contaminated with the _Clostridium botulinum_ toxin may not look or smell spoiled, but can cause nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness and death in some cases.

Mustard relish from HardyWares Preserves in Nova Scotia is under recall by Canadian authorities because of possible contamination with the bacterium that causes botulism poisoning. The recalled relish, sold in 250 ml [about 8.5 oz] jars, can be identified by the HardyWares logo on the label and a "packaged on" date of 3 Dec 2015, according to the recall notice on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's website. No other traceability information is available.

Laboratory test results spurred the recall. No illnesses had been linked to the recalled mustard relish as of Wed 13 Apr 2016, Canadian authorities warn that consumers should not eat the recalled mustard relish. "Check to see if you have recalled products in your home. Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased," according to the recall notice.

The HardyWares Preserves website describes the company as a home-based business that has been producing jellies, jams, garnishes and pickled foods since 2008.

[The distribution of the mustard relish product was not stated.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
