First Report of Blackleg Disease Caused by _Leptosphaeria maculans_ on
Canola in Brazil.
W. G. D. Fernando and P. S. Parks, Department of Plant Science, University
of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; G. Tomm and L. V. Viau,
Pesquisador da Embrapa Trigo, 99001-970 Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil; and C.
Jurke, Advanta Seeds, Inc. 3-75 Scurfield Blvd., Winnipeg, MB R3Y 1P6,
Canada. Plant Dis. 87:314,2003; published on-line as D-2003-0117-01N, 2003.
Accepted for publication 7 Jan 2003.
Canola (_Brassica napus_ L.), a relatively new crop in Brazil, has been
grown there for 8 years. In 2000, leaf lesions and stem cankers were
observed in cvs. Hyola 420 and Hyola 401 in farmers' fields in the state of
Rio Grande do Sul. Cankered stems were received at the University of
Manitoba, Canada, from Rio Grande do Sul for disease identification.
Small stem pieces were cut from the cankered area, and standard protocol
was followed to surface-sterilize them. Pieces were plated on V8 agar
medium and incubated under light for 12 days. Typical fungal colonies with
concentric rings containing pycnidia formed on the agar. The colony
characteristics were typical of the blackleg pathogen, _Leptosphaeria
maculans_ [Lm] (Desmaz.) Ces. & De Not. (anamorph = _Phoma lingam_)
(Tode:Fr.) Desmaz.).
Blackleg is an economically important and serious disease in many parts of
the world including Australia, Canada, the United States, and Europe. Lm
strains can be characterized in 4 pathogenicity groups (PG1 through PG4)
based on differential testing procedures giving interaction phenotype (IP)
reactions (2).
2 weeks after plating on V8 media, plates were flooded with sterile
distilled water, and pycnidiospores were harvested. Flats of multipots
filled with Metro Mix were seeded with 3 cultivars (Westar, Glacier, and
Quinta).
1-week-old cotyledons from the 3 cultivars were inoculated with
pycnidiospore suspensions (20 million pycnidiospores per ml) of 7 Brazilian
isolates, numbered 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, and 18, respectively. Each
cotyledon leaf, punctured in the center with a needle, was inoculated with
a 10-microliter droplet of inoculum.
Disease evaluations were made 11 days after inoculation using a 0 to 9
rating scale (1) and repeated 3 times from February 2001 to October 2001.
After the second repeat, the isolates from Rio Grande do Sul were passed
through the highly susceptible canola cv. Westar.
Results from all 4 trials were consistent, and yielded 1 PG1 isolate (No.
7) and 6 PG3 isolates. PG1 is classified as a nonaggressive strain, whereas
PG3 isolates are classified as aggressive. PG3 isolates would have an IP
reaction of 7 to 9, 7 to 9, and 3 to 6 on cvs. Westar, Glacier, and Quinta,
respectively. PG2 is the most commonly found aggressive strain in the
Canadian prairies. PG3 is predominantly found in Australia, the United
Kingdom, and the United States.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of blackleg disease caused by Lm
on canola in Brazil. Differential testing fulfilled Koch's postulates and
determined the PG groups found in Brazil (PG1 and PG3).

[Blackleg is considered to be the most damaging disease of canola in the
major production areas (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the UK).
Stems are weakened by cankers, resulting in plants falling over. Complete
crop losses can occur. Disease management includes the use of resistant
cultivars if available, deep plowing to bury infested and infected plant
material, crop rotation of at least 3 years, and treatment of seed with
recommended fungicides.
