[The location of the outbreak in one of the northern departments of Uruguay
can be seen on the map at the end of the OIE WAHID report referenced above
or at <http://encarta.msn.com/map_701516037/Rivera.html>.

Vampire bat transmitted rabies is both an animal health and public health
problem. _Desmodus rotundus_ is the hematophagous bat most commonly
involved in transmission to mammals and there are an estimated one million
bovine cases per year in South America. Vaccination is the key to prevent
transmission, especially once an outbreak has started.

Since it is Hallowe'en [31 Oct], I treated myself to reading the following
reference: Baer GM. Vampire bat and bovine paralytic rabies. In: Baer GM,
ed. Natural history of rabies. 2nd ed. Boca Raton: CRC Pr, 1991: 389-403. -
