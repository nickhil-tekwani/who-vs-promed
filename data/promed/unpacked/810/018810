The eastern French region of Hautes-Alpes [Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region] said [Mon 3 Sep 2018] it has begun vaccinating cows and sheep against anthrax after an outbreak of the fatal infection in the region. Anthrax has been detected in 23 locations, local authorities said in a statement, with 54 animals killed, mainly bovines.

Vaccination doses for 5000 cows and 10 000 sheep have been rushed to the area to tackle the worst anthrax outbreak in France in nearly 20 years.

Anthrax is an infection spread by spores of the _Bacillus anthracis_ bacteria which occur naturally and can be ingested by livestock and passed on to humans, usually through skin contact, causing black lesions. If left untreated it can be fatal.

[French reports:

https://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/sante/anthrax-dans-les-hautes-alpes-instauration-de-la-vaccination-animale_127171

The latter report has the following communes affected: Ancelle, Chorges, Gap (Romette), La Batie-Neuve, La Fressinouse, La Roche-des-Arnauds, Montgardin, Rambaud, Saint-Bonnet-en-Champsaur, Saint-Etienne-le-Laus, Saint-Leger-les-Melezes, Saint-Michel-de-Chaillol, and Theus. Not a minor concern. We wish them well.

Something our medical colleagues may be unaware of is that when vaccinating livestock there is always the real risk that for various reasons one is likely to vaccinate oneself. So with some 15 000 head to be vaccinated they will experience a few handlers vaccinated with Sterne. No real problems, just some inflammation. The S19 brucella vaccine would put you to bed for a number of days. Not pleasant. - Mod.MHJ
