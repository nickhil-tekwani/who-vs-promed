Singapore authorities said they expected within two to three weeks the
results of tests by the CDC in Atlanta on blood and tissue samples taken
from eight Singapore abattoir workers diagnosed as suffering from
encephalitis. One of the eight has died and initial tests showed signs of
a different strain [a different virus? - Mod.CHC], indicating that more
than one killer virus may be lurking in livestock.
"We haven't ruled out Japanese encephalitis. It can be that some cases are
Japanese encephalitis and some cases are another virus," said primary
production department director Ngiam Tong Tau.
Moves to prevent the spread in Singapore of another strain, known as the
Hendra virus, have been implemented through a ban on pig imports from
Malaysia and there were no more pigs in Singapore, he said.
"We can only say Hendra has been isolated in cases in Malaysia. In
Singapore we cannot definitely say. We will have to wait until the results
come back from the CDC in Atlanta," he added.
Three Singaporean abattoir workers were in serious condition and four
others in stable condition, the health ministry said.
But since 19 March 1999, "no new cases have been admitted to hospital,"
Ngiam said. Health authorities said 510 of the 550 abattoir workers in
Singapore had already been screened and tests on the remaining 40 would be
completed over the next two days.
After receiving word from Malaysia that some victims there had signs of
Hendra, named after an Australian town where it struck horses and humans in
1994, Singapore took further precautions by banning cross-border travel of
all animals including horses, pigs, dogs and cats, said Ngiam.
More than 20 jockeys, 15 trainers and some 200 workers in Singapore's horse
racing industry are to undergo screening on Wednesday for signs of Hendra,
and 2000 horses in its stables are under close watch as well. The
Singapore Turf Club said it was confident that horses in its stables were
free of Hendra and the virus which causes Japanese encephalitis, since
vaccination of the horses has been mandatory for more than 20 years. Races
scheduled in Singapore in April would go ahead as planned, it added.
Malaysia's Selangor Turf Club has called off horse racing this weekend due
to restrictions imposed amid the virus outbreak in Malaysia.
