As the cases of COVID-19 again have hiked, a new subvariant was confirmed in India by WHO. According to World Health Organisation Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, this subvariant BA.2.75 of the omicron variant of COVID-19 has been reported in various countries including India. Ghebreyesus further added that the world body was following the development.

"On COVID-19, globally reported cases have increased nearly 30% over the past 2 weeks. Four out of 6 of the WHO sub-regions saw cases increase in the last week," Ghebreyesus said during a press briefing on Wednesday [6 Jul 2022]. "In Europe and America, BA.4 and BA.5 are driving waves. In countries like India, a new sublineage of BA.2.75 has also been detected, which we're following," the WHO chief said.

On Wednesday [6 Jul 2022], India reported 16 159 new COVID cases in the previous 24 hours, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. As per the Health Ministry, 15 394 COVID patients recovered from the disease during the period, taking the total number of recoveries since the onset of the pandemic in the country to 42 907 327. The rate of recovery currently is 98.53%.

WHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan also highlighted in a briefing yesterday [6 Jul 2022] that there has been an emergence of a subvariant known as BA.2.75. She stated the subvariant was first reported from India and then from about 10 other countries.

"There are still limited sequences available of the subvariant to analyse, but this subvariant seems to have a few mutations on the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. So obviously, that's a key part of the virus that attaches itself to the human receptor. We have to watch that. It's still too early to know if this subvariant has properties of additional immune evasion or indeed of being more clinically severe. We don't know that," the chief scientist said. "So we have to wait and see," she said, adding that the world health body is keeping an eye on it, and the Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE) is continuously analysing the data from across the world.

WHO Incident Manager COVID-19 Abdi Mahamud warned and said that now is not the time to declare that the pandemic is over. "We're still in the midst of the pandemic, and the virus has a lot of force left. So whether it is the BA.4 or BA.5 or BA.2.75, the virus will continue. It does what it does good," he said. He also stated that people and communities must continue to take necessary precautions such as wearing masks, avoiding crowds, and ensuring that the people who are more vulnerable and at high risk are protected.

[The new omicron subvariant BA.2.75 has mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein that interacts with the human cell receptors. However, of note, "It's still too early to know if this subvariant has properties of additional immune evasion or indeed of being more clinically severe." Monitoring of emerging variants and subvariants of concern is important in predicting upcoming increase in cases, thereby serving as an important tool in response planning. - Mod.UBA]

There has been a sharp decline in the number of reported cases and deaths from all regions with the Americas not reporting over the last 24 hours -- most likely the weekend affect at play -- and the actual trends will become clearer later in the week.

- The Americas region reported no cases or deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported more than 164.53 million cases, 2nd to the European region, the most severely affected region.

- The European region reported 46.1% of cases and 35.3% of deaths over the last 24 hours, as the most affected region, with cumulative cases exceeding 232.26 million. Many countries did not report cases in the last 24 hours or longer, including France, the UK, Turkey, Spain, Ukraine, the Netherlands, Romania, Hungary, and Ireland, among others. A total of 6 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours, with no countries reporting more than 100 000 cases, 3 countries reporting more than 10 000, and 3 reporting over 1000 cases; 2 countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 3.8% of cases and 6.4% of deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 22.13 million cases. Iraq (4774) reported the highest number of cases followed by Iran and UAE. Pakistan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia reported more than 500, but less than 1000 cases over the last 24 hours.

- The African region reported 0.11% of cases and 6 deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 9.15 million cases. Only 10 countries reported in the region with Kenya (88) reporting the highest number. However, numbers from all reporting countries remained under 100 or 50 cases in the last 24 hours.

- The Western Pacific region reported 42.5% of daily case numbers and 41.8% of deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 65.60 million cases. Japan (50 918) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by China, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, and Brunei.

- The South East Asia region reported 7.5% of the daily newly reported cases and 14.9% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 58.81 million cases. India (16 678) reported the highest number of cases followed by Thailand (1811) and Indonesia (1681). Bangladesh, Maldives, and North Korea did not report cases over the last 24 hours.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 11 Jul 2022, is an excellent visual representation of the pandemic. - Mod. UBA]

[In the past 24 hours, 17 countries including France (251 337), Germany (158 224), the USA (153 303), Japan (96 951), Italy (83 761), Australia (48 418), Brazil (44 043), South Korea (37 323), Taiwan (19 128), the Netherlands (15 415), Portugal (15 415), Romania (14 943), Peru (14 170), Israel (12 648), New Zealand (11 852), India (11 487), and El Salvador (11 324) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 1698 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (10-11 Jul 2022).

A total of 43 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 24 of the 43 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 3 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, and none are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 15.7%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 16.9%. Comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 5.6% decrease in daily reported cases and 7.5% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 1.09 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 561.78 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.37 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
