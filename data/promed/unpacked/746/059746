USA

USA (Hawaii, Big Island). 23 Nov 2015. Dengue (conf.) 92 cases, 79 cases in residents, 67 cases in adults, 22 cases in children.
http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/30588523/4-new-dengue-fever-cases-bring-total-to-92

[A 21 Nov 2015 report cites Dr. Randal Covin, Blood Bank of Hawaii Medical Director saying that Hawaii does not screen its supplies for the dengue virus at this time as there is no licensed test for the donated blood and the center has several safety protocols in place such as:
- Donors must be healthy and feeling well on day of donation.
- Donors have their temperature taken at the time of donation and cannot have a fever to donate.
Those who feel ill within 2 weeks of donation should contact Blood Bank of Hawaii as soon as possible (http://www.hawaii247.com/2015/11/21/does-dengue-fever-threaten-the-blood-supply/).]

Sudan (Darfur). 17 Nov 2015. Dengue (reported) as of 13 Nov 2015, 381 cases; Deaths 118 cases; Sates affected: West Darfur 268 cases, Central Darfur 53 cases, North Darfur 43 cases, East Darfur 11 cases, and South Darfur 6 cases.
https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/darfur-dengue-update-118-deaths-decline-expected

[As mentioned in the previous post, the case fatality rate is extremely high. Either the total case count is too low, or deaths are due to other factors. The situation in the Darfur states over the past 2 months has been confused. Significant numbers of deaths have been attributed to an undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever. Other deaths have been attributed to West Nile virus infections. In the above report, severe dengue is reported as the cause of many deaths.
