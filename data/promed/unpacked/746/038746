A total of 50 cases of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) have been detected in Goa since January this year [2018].

The disease is mostly limited to the Sattari taluka and none of the 50 cases was found to be critical. No death due to KFD has been reported.

Dr Utkarsh Betodkar, epidemiologist at the directorate of health services (DHS), said that areas like Casarvanem, Dharbandora, Betki, Madkai which were the worst-affected last year [2017] have witnessed zero cases this season. He said that this was the result of the intensified awareness carried out by the directorate of health services among villagers by conducting programmes on information, education and communication.

"We have continued the vaccination drive and are distributing demethyl phthalate (DMP) tick repellent oil among the villagers which they have to apply on their bodies before venturing into forests, especially in cashew plantations," he said adding that there is a need to take precaution, as the end of the cashew season in the state is still a month away.

In 2016, a total of 285 persons were afflicted within Goa, 3 among whom died. In 2017, the number of KFD cases plunged to 85, with no KFD related deaths reported last year [2017]. Dr Betodkar said that the KFD cases are expected to be less than the previous year [2017].

He advised the people visiting cashew plantations to walk on along clear trails and avoid coming in contact with the weeds, adding that resting in cashew plantation may invite tick bites.

He said that it will be safer for people to wear full-sleeves shirts and long pants to avoid being bitten by ticks. Besides, people need to take a scrub bath on their return home to get rid of ticks.

[KFD continues to be a zoonotic disease of public health concern in Goa state and other parts of India where the disease in endemic.
Prophylaxis by vaccination, as well as preventive measures like protective clothing, tick control, and mosquito control are advised. The vaccine for KFDV consists of formalin-inactivated KFDV. The vaccine has a 62.4 percent effectiveness rate for individuals who receive 2 doses. For individuals who receive an additional dose, the effectiveness increases to 82.9 percent [Kasabi, Gudadappa; Murhekar, Manoj; Sandhya, Vijay; Raghunandan, Ramappa; Kiran, Shivani; Channabasappa, Gowdra; Mehendale, Sanjay (2013). "Coverage and Effectiveness of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) Vaccine in Karnataka, South India, 2005-10." Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases. 7 (1): 1-4]. Specific treatments are not available.

Vaccination with formalin-inactivated tissue-culture vaccine has been the primary strategy for controlling KFD. The strategy involves mass vaccination in areas reporting KFD activity (i.e., laboratory evidence of KFD virus [KFDV] in monkeys, humans, or ticks) and in villages within a 5-km [3.106 mi approx.] radius of such areas [Directorate of Health and Family Welfare Services, Government of Karnataka, 2005 manual on Kyasanur Forest disease; unpub. data]. Two vaccine doses are administered at least one month apart to persons 7-65 years of age. Vaccine-induced immunity is short-lived, so the 1st booster dose of vaccine is recommended within 6-9 months after primary vaccination; thereafter, annual booster doses are recommended for 5 years after the last confirmed case in the area https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/1/14-1227_article.
