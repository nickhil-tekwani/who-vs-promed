The Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) reported investigating a probable case of botulism after receiving injections of botulinum toxin locally. The female patient, aged 24 with good past health, presented with chest discomfort, shortness of breath, generalized weakness and palpitation since 3 Sep 2021. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Yan Chai Hospital on that day and was admitted. She remained in a stable condition and was discharged on 6 Sep 2021. The clinical diagnosis was suspected iatrogenic botulism.

According to the information provided by the patient, she received botulinum toxin injections over the calves in a beauty premises in Mong Kok on 3 Sep 2021. Investigations are ongoing.

"When botulinum toxin is used for cosmetic purposes, its cosmetic effects after injections are temporary and will gradually disappear. If referred to a doctor for the procedure, customers should look for his or her full name against the list of registered doctors of the Medical Council of Hong Kong as well as his or her professional qualifications and relevant experience," a spokesperson for the Department of Health (DOH) said.

Due to the weakening of associated muscles and the fact that botulinum toxin may spread and affect other areas beyond the injection site, affected patients may have drooping of the eyelids, double vision or blurred vision, problems with chewing, hoarseness or even difficulties in swallowing, speaking or breathing, which may happen hours, days or weeks after the injection.

The DOH urged the public to observe the health advice below before receiving botulinum toxin injections:

- Injections should be performed only by locally registered doctors;
- Understand the procedure, potential risks and complications before receiving injections. Consult a doctor for an informed decision;
- Do not receive an injection in the case of history of allergy to botulinum toxin, or infection or inflammation on the injection site;
- Request the full name of the doctor in writing if referred by a beauty service provider for the procedure, as well as the professional qualifications and relevant experience; and
- If symptoms develop, such as fever or feeling unwell, seek medical attention immediately.

There are 5 main kinds of botulism: infant botulism, wound, foodborne, iatrogenic and adult intestinal toxemia. Iatrogenic botulism can happen if too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic reasons, such as for wrinkles, or medical reasons, such as for migraine headaches.

[At least a dozen cases of systemic botulism from the cosmetic use of botulism toxin were reported in 2016 from Hong Kong, most acquired from injections done on the mainland.

A 2008 petition to have a black box warning on botulinum toxin for injection (https://www.citizen.org/our-work/health-and-safety/petition-requesting-regulatory-action-concerning-spread) is reproduced below documenting systemic effects and deaths from these injections in the USA. The citations can be found at the original URL.

"Botulinum toxin is one of several proteins produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulinum toxin acts by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles, causing those muscles to relax resulting in a loss of muscle control. In the case of food poisoning from botulinum toxin, in which the toxin spreads widely around the body, early symptoms include dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, drooping eyelids, and muscle weakness. Subsequent paralysis of respiratory muscles can lead to death.

"In the case of injected therapeutic or cosmetic use of botulinum toxin, if the product spreads from the injection site to another area of the body, this loss of muscle control can be similarly harmful. For example, when muscle control to the esophagus is lost (dysphagia), one loses the ability to control swallowing; food and drink can then accidentally reflux and be aspirated into the respiratory tract and lungs, causing a serious complication, aspiration pneumonia, and occasionally lead to death.

"Botulinum toxins are classified as distinct serotypes, with different potencies but the same mechanism of action. Types A and B have been developed commercially for use as drugs. In the USA, there are 2 approved products: Botox (Allergan), which is type A, and Myobloc (Solstice Neurosciences), which is type B.

"The 2 broad indications for the use of botulinum toxins are therapeutic and cosmetic. FDA-approved therapeutic uses include cervical dystonia (contractions of the neck and/or shoulder muscles that cannot be controlled), strabismus (crossed eyes), blepharospasm (spasmodic blinking of the eyes), and primary axillary hyperhydrosis (excessive underarm sweating; Botox only). Botox has one approved cosmetic use (Myobloc has none), and that is for temporary improvement of glabellar lines (wrinkles between the eyebrows). Most cosmetic use of botulinum toxin is unapproved by the FDA and is therefore considered off-label."

Therapeutic uses
----------------
"Significant rates of dysphagia were documented in the medical officer's clinical reviews of both Myobloc (October 1999) (12) and Botox therapeutic (November 1999) (13). In most studies, patients had previously been exposed to botulinum toxin. Since those with previous adverse events would presumably be less likely to enroll in subsequent trials, the incidence of dysphagia may be underestimated.

"Botox: There was only one RCT [randomized controlled trial] for Botox therapeutic that was placebo-controlled (Study 140). The rates of dysphagia were 7% vs 4% (treated vs placebo). Severity grades were only provided for the 6 cases in the treated group: 3 moderate and 3 mild cases of dysphagia (14).

"Myobloc: The 3 RCTs for Myobloc consisted of one phase II range-finding study (Study 009) and 2 phase III trials (Studies 301 and 302). The only difference between studies 301 and 302 was that subjects in the former had cervical dystonia symptoms that were still responsive to Botox, while those in Study 302 had ceased to respond to Botox. The data below summarize the incidence of dysphagia in all placebo-controlled trials of this product, based on only one dose. (Doses of Botox and Myobloc cannot be compared directly, as they are different botulinum toxins.)

Incidence of dysphagia in all Myobloc placebo-controlled studies (15)
Dosage / Number of patients / Percentage dysphagia
Placebo dose / 123 / 2
Less than 2500 U / 92 / 9
2500-7500 U / 67 / 10
7500-10 000 U / 106 / 25

"A summary of the severity of dysphagia for all Myobloc-exposed patients, both those in placebo-controlled and open-label studies, is shown below.

Severity of dysphagia in all Myobloc studies (n = 531) (16). All toxin-treated subjects = 29% with dysphagia
19% of all therapy -- mild dysphagia
8% of all therapy -- moderate dysphagia
1% of all therapy -- severe dysphagia

"Although these trials were small and consisted only of a single dose, the results have a consistency that lends them added weight. The medical officer noted that dysphagia was consistently the 2nd most common adverse event after dry mouth and '...the most common important adverse effect of Botox treatments for cervical dystonia reported in the medical literature' (17). While not having as high an incidence of serious cases as dry mouth, serious dysphagia cases 'can be more medically risky' and 'even moderate grade events in these 2 categories have been responsible for patients discontinuing repetitive injections...' (18).

Cosmetic uses
-------------
"The Botox cosmetic reviews found the incidence of muscle weakness in treated patients in 2 placebo-controlled clinical trials to be 1% and 3%. There were no cases of muscle weakness in the placebo groups and no cases of dysphagia in either the treated or placebo groups (19).

"Thus, dysphagia was a common adverse event in the clinical trials conducted prior to approval and occurred in a dose-related fashion. Although most cases were mild, some severe cases did occur.

FDA analysis of adverse events
------------------------------
"FDA [Food and Drug Administration] subsequently highlighted the dangers of botulinum toxin in a published 2005 analysis of adverse events covering the period from 1989 to May 2003 (20). These adverse event data add to the clinical trial information because severe cases of dysphagia were not common in the clinical trials, and the adverse event data would tend to include more severe cases of dysphagia. The adverse event data also emphasize that, although dysphagia was more common in therapeutic than cosmetic clinical trials (presumably due to higher doses and, for many indications, greater proximity to the esophagus), cosmetic cases have been reported, and some have been serious.

"Therapeutic use: The FDA analysis found 406 adverse event reports related to therapeutic use, 217 of which met the FDA's definition of serious. There were 26 reports of serious adverse events involving dysphagia (including one death due to aspiration pneumonia) and 13 reports of non-serious dysphagia.

"Cosmetic use: There were 36 serious reports related to cosmetic use, including 2 reports of dysphagia, but no deaths. There were, in addition, 995 non-serious reports for cosmetic use, the most frequent of which was 'lack of intended effect' (63%). Four of the non-serious reports were for dysphagia. The agency also noted that 'numerous departures from FDA-approved recommendations for drug use, dilution, handling, site of injection, and storage were noted in these AE [adverse event] reports.'

Public Citizen analysis of adverse events
-----------------------------------------
"We have done our own analysis using the FDA adverse event database for cases submitted to the agency by drug manufacturers between 1 Nov 1997 and 31 Dec 2006.... We found 658 cases of adverse events for all searched Preferred Terms, of which 180 (27%) were associated with aspiration, dysphagia, or pneumonia. Of these 180, 106 had an indication listed: 18 cosmetic only and 87 non-cosmetic only. Eighty-seven of the cases associated with these 3 Preferred Terms were hospitalized, and 16 died (including 4 children less than 18 years of age). Table 1 presents the cases broken down by Preferred Term and Outcome, while Table 2 contains a description of the 16 deaths, one of which was associated with cosmetic use."

"It should be noted that these data come from voluntary reports submitted to the FDA, which have been estimated to represent about 10% of the actual occurrences. Additional limits to our data include causality cannot be proved, other Preferred Terms may exist that might increase our counts, some fields such as Outcome are not consistently filled in, and reports from individual consumers were not included." - Mod.LL
