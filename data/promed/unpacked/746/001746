Rural poor most at risk from rabies
-----------------------------------
A 65-year-old woman recalls in horror when a snarling dog bit her
husband 4 years ago. Before he died, the farmer hallucinated and
convulsed. "He barked like a dog," she said. "We put a chain on him
and locked him up."

He had contracted rabies, a virus that kills nearly all victims who
develop symptoms. The woman could not afford to bring her husband to
the capital Phnom Penh, the only city in Cambodia that has a centre
offering free treatment. Even if she had, it would have been too late.
He left behind his family of 7, who are struggling to make ends meet
through farming.

Cambodians in the countryside have little access to treatment for
rabies, a preventable disease that disproportionately affects the
rural young and poor. If dog-bite victims do not seek immediate
treatment, they are likely to die. The virus is untreatable after
symptoms appear, which can be anything from 10 days to a year after
being bitten.

"The loss of a family member to rabies has a profound psychological
impact on the family," said Deborah Briggs, head of the Global
Alliance for Rabies Control, a US-based NGO. "The disease is
frightening and it is devastating to watch a loved one die." In 2007,
the most recent year data are available, 810 human rabies deaths may
have occurred in Cambodia, says a study in Neglected Tropical
Diseases, a science journal. [See: Rabies Situation in Cambodia. Ly
S, Buchy P, Heng NY, Ong S, Chhor N, et al. (2009) Rabies Situation in
Cambodia. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 3(9): e511.
doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0000511;
http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0000511.

This number is only an estimate. Hundreds of cases in the countryside
go unreported, because patients are rarely hospitalized and tend to
die at home. The estimated rabies mortality for 2007 exceeded that of
malaria (240 deaths) and dengue fever (400 deaths), the study said.

The report concluded that free post-exposure prophylaxis, an
injection after a bite that prevents infection, is really only
relevant for residents of Phnom Penh. Injections must be administered
promptly, usually within 10 days of an infection. The Pasteur
Institute, a nonprofit medical research and treatment centre in Phnom
Penh, is the only institution in Cambodia offering free post-exposure
treatments.

The rural poor often cannot afford lengthy and expensive visits to
the capital and therefore miss out on the free treatment. "We see
maybe 5 patients per year who arrive with symptoms," says Philippe
Buchy, head of the virology unit at the Pasteur Institute, "and the
only thing we can do is to send them to Calmette Hospital where they
will die after few days."

The fact that poor people are most susceptible to rabies means
campaigns against the virus tend to be given lower priority, said
Francois-Xavier Meslin, the Geneva-based team leader for neglected
zoonotic diseases at the World Health Organization (WHO).

Epidemiology of rabies
----------------------
Warm-blooded mammals, mostly dogs, spread the virus through bites,
scratches, and licking on open wounds.

Typically between 10 days and a year after exposure, patients
experience insomnia, headaches, a fever, and twitching around their
wound. Two to 10 days after those 1st signs appear, they hallucinate,
have seizures, become fearful at the sight of water and experience
paralysis. Most rabies patients die from respiratory failure.

Each year, about 55 000 people around the world die from rabies. More
than 80 percent of cases are in Asia, according to WHO, which says
half of all human rabies deaths occur in children under 15. "Every one
of those deaths could have been prevented as we have the vaccines.
available to save their lives before clinical signs begin," Briggs
told IRIN.

In Bali, Indonesia, authorities culled 100 000 dogs to prevent the
spread of rabies by shooting poison blow darts at them, but the
authorities halted this policy last September [2010] in favour of a
mass inoculation programme of 400 000 dogs (70 percent of the island's
dog population). WHO's Meslin does not advocate killing dogs because
it is "inhumane," he told IRIN.

In Cambodia, the Pasteur Institute recommends setting up a national
rabies control programme to improve disease surveillance and access to
treatment. It also recommends starting vaccination campaigns for
dogs.

[According to S. Ly et al. (reference given in the text above):
"During 1998/2007, 124 749 patients received PEP at IPC [Institut
Pasteur] (average 12 470; range 8907 ­ 14 475), and 63 fatal human
cases presenting with encephalitis following a dog bite were reported,
in which 73 percent were confirmed positive for rabies by direct
immunofluorescence assay or by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction. During 1998/2007, IPC tested 1255 animal brain samples; 1214
(97 percent) were from dogs including 610 (49 percent) positive
samples. In 2007, 14 475 patients received PEP (100 PEP/100 000 people
in Cambodia) including 95 percent who resided in Phnom Penh (615
PEP/100 000) or 5 neighboring provinces. The predictive model
estimated 810 human rabies deaths would occur in 2007 (95 percent
confidence interval [CI] 394 ­ 1607), an incidence of 5.8/100 000 (95
percent CI 2.8 ­ 11.5)."

It would seem to this moderator that since the dogs are the
predominant (perhaps only?) vector of rabies efforts should be devoted
predominantly to controlling and eradicating canine rabies rather than
attempting to provide universal access to PEP.
