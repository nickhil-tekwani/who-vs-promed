Over 150 people have fallen ill in a food poisoning epidemic in the Tampere
region, according to health officials on Mon 31 Jul 2006. The epidemic,
described as exceptionally large by the Valkeakoski hospital, is suspected
to originate from salad served at various staff canteens in Tampere late
last week. Officials noted that no further cases have been diagnosed since
Fri 28 Jul 2006.
The food poisoning has affected 50-80 people in Tampere and 100 people in
Valkeakoski. "I cannot recall ever having witnessed so many cases of
illness at the same time," said health officer Pertti Hyvarinen.
Some of those suffering from food poisoning have had violent symptoms
lasting 1-3 days, but no lives have been in danger. Samples of food served
at the canteens have been sent to be examined at a laboratory. Results are
expected later on Mon 31 Jul 2006.

[It is unclear whether the illness was a bacterial toxin-induced disease,
such as staphylococcal or clostridial food poisoning, an infection per se,
such as norovirus, or a non-infectious toxin disease. It would be useful to
know about the presence or absence of fever, the symptoms, and the
incubation period.
