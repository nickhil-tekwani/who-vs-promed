Anthrax found in man's body after heroin-related death
------------------------------------------------------
An investigation begins after a 29-year-old man dies after taking
heroin that was contaminated with anthrax. Anthrax has been found in
the body of a 29-year-old Leicestershire drug user who died after
taking heroin. Police and the Health Protection Agency are
investigating the death of [the Loughborough man], who died on [Thu
26 Aug 2010].

This is the 4th time anthrax has been detected in a drug user in
England since February 2010. Health officials have urged all heroin
users to stop taking the drug and to seek treatment immediately. Four
Loughborough men aged 24, 31, 35, and 37 were arrested in connection
with the death but have been released on police bail pending further inquiries.

Leicestershire Police said a post-mortem examination on [the
deceased] was taking place on [Tue 31 Aug 2010].

Dr Philip Monk, of the East Midlands South unit of the Health
Protection Agency, said there was no risk to people who did not take
heroin. "I'd like to reassure people that there is no risk to the
general population, including close family members of the deceased."

Tim Davies, deputy director of public health at NHS Leicestershire
County and Rutland, said: "While public health investigations are
ongoing, it must be assumed that all heroin in Leicestershire carries
the risk of anthrax contamination." He said people should seek
medical advice if they experienced signs of infection, such as
redness or excessive swelling at or near an injection site, as early
antibiotic treatment could be lifesaving. "This is a very serious
infection for drug users and prompt treatment is crucial." Anthrax is
a very rare [in the UK] but serious bacterial infection caused by the
organism _Bacillus anthracis_.

[The dead man's] family said he was "a happy-go-lucky lad and was
always full of fun". They added he was "first and foremost a
dedicated father to [his 5-year-old son]. He was a very considerate
and polite man. He kept himself busy by keeping fit which included
kick-boxing with his dad, brother, and his son."

Heroin dealer snared during anthrax probe
-----------------------------------------
A drug dealer who was caught by police investigating the supply of
heroin contaminated with anthrax has been jailed for 4 years. He
admitted selling the Class A drug to 6 people in the town between
February and April this year [2010]. Judge Lord Turnbull said he
would have been jailed for 6 years if he had not pleaded guilty at an
early stage.

The court heard that he had previous drug convictions involving cocaine.

Laura Thomson, prosecuting, said: "He admitted supplying to 6 people,
heroin with a total value in the region of GBP 38 000 [approx. USD 58
500] to GBP 40 000 [approx USD 62 000]." The High Court in Glasgow
was told the drug was part of a supply chain that originated in
Liverpool. Forteath also said that along with another person, he had
a suitcase stuffed with heroin that had a potential value of GBP 26
000 [approx. USD 40 000].

His defence counsel, Susan Duff, said the fact that her client had
the condition Asperger's syndrome partly explained his drug
activities. She said: "He became involved solely for financial gain
after he found difficulty finding and keeping jobs because of his
Asperger's." Judge Lord Turnbull told Forteath: "You involved
yourself in the heroin trade and were in the process of supplying
more when you were caught. If it had not been for your early plea of
guilty I would have jailed you for 6 years."

[With any luck the "suitcase stuffed with heroin" was of the/an
anthrax spore contaminated batch. Analysis of this would reveal how
the heroin got contaminated. The working and very speculative
hypothesis at this time is that raw material was collected in
Afghanistan in goat skins of animals that had died of anthrax. - Mod.MHJ]

[Asperger syndrome is an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), one of a
distinct group of neurological conditions characterized by a greater
or lesser degree of impairment in language and communication skills,
as well as repetitive or restrictive patterns of thought and behavior
(<http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/asperger/asperger.htm>). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]

Death of injecting drug user in Leicestershire
----------------------------------------------
The Health Protection Agency (HPA) and NHS [National Health Service]
Leicestershire County and Rutland can confirm that they are
investigating the death of a drug injecting heroin user in
Leicestershire. Testing of samples from the patient has confirmed the
presence of anthrax.

This is the 4th case of anthrax seen in an injecting drug user in
England, the 1st being announced in London on 5 Feb 2010. [There were
2 prior cases in London and one in Liverpool, plus a related case in
Germany. - Mod.MHJ] Similar cases have been seen in Scotland since
December 2009 with 47 cases having been confirmed and one in Germany.
Similarities to the cases in Scotland suggest that the heroin, or a
contaminated cutting agent mixed with the heroin, is the likely
source of infection.

Dr Philip Monk, Consultant in Communicable Disease at HPA East
Midlands South Unit said: "We are working closely with NHS
Leicestershire County and Rutland to monitor the situation. I'd like
to reassure people that there is no risk to the general population,
including close family members of the deceased. It is extremely
unlikely that this form of anthrax can spread from person to person."

Tim Davies, Deputy Director of Public Health from NHS Leicestershire
County and Rutland, said: "While public health investigations are
ongoing, it must be assumed that all heroin in Leicestershire carries
the risk of anthrax contamination. I urge all heroin users to be
extremely alert to the risks and to seek urgent medical advice if
they experience signs of infection such as redness or excessive
swelling at or near an injection site, or other symptoms of general
illness such a high temperature, chills, or a severe headache, or
breathing difficulties, as early antibiotic treatment can be lifesaving.

"Heroin users are strongly advised to cease taking heroin by any
route, if at all possible, and to seek help from their local drug
treatment services. This is a very serious infection for drug users
and prompt treatment is crucial."

He added: "If friends and family are concerned about a family member
or friend and their drug use there are a number of services,
including their GP, Social Services and local drug teams who can help
advise about where the most appropriate help can be found."
