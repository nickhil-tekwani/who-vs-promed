Brooklyn mumps outbreak continues
---------------------------------
A mumps outbreak in Brooklyn that has lasted for months has prompted health
officials to issue a multistate mumps outbreak alert, warning health care
providers in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to be aware of the
problem. New York City is dealing with nearly 600 confirmed and suspected
cases. Most of the patients have one thing in common: religion. The cases
started turning up in late August [2009].

Mumps is an illness characterized by acute swelling of the salivary gland
lasting 2 or more days. The illness can cause deafness and encephalitis. A
person can be infected for 2 days before symptoms appear. The health
department is telling people who suspect they have mumps to stay home for 5
days. Children who are not fully vaccinated against mumps are the highest
risk of infection.

Not immune from mumps
---------------------
Stemming from an initial mumps outbreak that wreaked havoc at a Jewish camp
this summer [summer of 2009], 247 New York City residents plus 131 other
state residents [as of 1 Dec 2009] have since contracted the disease, which
remains mostly contained among fervently Orthodox adolescent boys in
pockets of New York, New Jersey, and Quebec, according to official reports
from the New York City and State Departments of Health.

The trigger case occurred back in June [2009], when an 11 year old boy
returned to his Sullivan County summer camp after traveling in the United
Kingdom, where an ongoing outbreak has now reached about 4000 cases [see
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/infections/immunisation.htm>, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported. From there, the mumps spread
to 24 other boys at the camp and continued to plague their local
communities when they returned home, and the median age of patients remains
around 14.

But perhaps the most frustrating news to some parents is that most of the
affected patients had received their proper 2-dose vaccination as children
-- 83 per cent, according to CDC.

"This is a very confusing issue not only for ourselves but for providers
and parents," said Cindy Schulte, vaccine-preventable disease surveillance
officer at the New York State Department of Health. "If you have a
population that's fairly well but unevenly vaccinated, by logic, you're
going to end up having some disease in the effective population." The
measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine has an 85 to 91 per cent efficacy
rate among those who take the proper doses, she said.

The commonest symptoms of this viral disease are fever, muscle aches, and
parotitis -- the signature inflammation of the salivary glands below the
ear. Though no deaths have occurred thus far and symptoms may often be
subtle, there have been several hospitalizations and one potential case of
meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain), according to Dr Debra
Blog, medical director at the Bureau of Immunization Program in the New
York State Department of Health.

Mumps can be particularly dangerous to pubescent boys, doctors say, because
a small number will develop orchitis, a swelling of the testicles that can
potentially (though rarely) lead to infertility. The same goes for girls,
who can develop swelling of the ovaries that can lead to sterility. While
mumps cases among women have certainly increased since the summer, New York
City infections remain around 79 per cent male, Blog explained.

"These communities tend to have social contact with themselves and tend to
be a bit isolated from the outside community," she said. "In New York City
especially it's going through their schools."

As of 30 Oct 2009, CDC had only reported a total of 179 cases in New York
and New Jersey and another 15 in Canada, but New York City health officials
say that the numbers have increased so dramatically in the past month
simply because doctors are taking more care to report their ill patients to
the government.

"We're still getting cases reported virtually every day," said Dr Chris
Zimmerman, medical director at the Bureau of Immunization in the New York
City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. "There was a substantial
increase just from the week before the alert to when the alert came out."
It is difficult to maintain an exact number of cases, Schulte added,
because disease spread is a "fluid number".

A mumps outbreak of this size has not occurred since 2006, when the United
States experienced over 6500 cases that were particularly hard-hitting
among college dormitory residents in Iowa. But the current wave largely
remains within pocketed chasidic communities, all linked back to that one
summer camp flare-up. "There have been less than a handful of cases outside
the community," Zimmerman said. "The population is segregated -- these kids
are not going to public schools, they're going to yeshivas," he continued.
"They only have the opportunity to interact with other boys in their
community."

And while statistics show that an overwhelming majority of the kids in
these neighborhoods are in fact properly vaccinated, the few outliers are
probably the ones perpetuating the disease spread, he added. "Overall,
immunization coverage is good, but this is a community that has had
resistance to MMR vaccines -- their parents have claimed religious
exemptions," Zimmerman said.

Yet despite outbreaks that have resurfaced from time to time, state medical
officials still maintain the mumps vaccine is a successful product,
particularly in what Blog calls "evenly vaccinated communities" -- those
who pretty much unanimously undergo the immunization.

Regarding the disease spread, another crucial element worth considering
among the allegedly vaccinated patients is whether or not their dosages
were properly refrigerated speculated Dr Michael Augenbraun, a professor of
epidemiology at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. "Breaks in the 'cold
chain' are a serious problem for vaccine efficacy if, for example, an
office allowed for a vaccine to sit out on countertops overnight,"
Augenbraun said, noting that we have no way of knowing this after so many
years, however.

Thus far, despite the one hospitalization and some cases of orchitis,
complications from this outbreak have generally been minimal. About 56 per
cent of the confirmed cases exhibited the parotitis, according to Schulte.
"We're not seeing the same rate of complications that we saw in the
pre-vaccine era," Zimmerman said, noting that before the vaccine, another
dangerous side effect of the mumps was permanent deafness. But the subtle
nature of so many of these current cases may be yet another reason that the
disease is spreading, because parents neglect to see a doctor about their
children's illnesses. So what can parents do to protect their families from
catching the mumps?

They should make sure that their children have received the 2 dosages of
the vaccine on time, ideally before their 1st birthday, Schulte said. If an
older child has not yet received the vaccine but hasn't yet been exposed to
the illness, this child too should be immunized. And if a child or adult
becomes sick, the best thing to do, as always, is to stay home from school
or work, wash hands frequently and see a doctor. Blog added, "Isolation and
vaccination are the most effective things along with common sense."

[This is now a very large outbreak in a population that is considered to be
well vaccinated. This is perhaps a consequence of maintenance of an
imported infection in a sub-set of the population which has declined
vaccination on the basis of religious convictions. Additionally, or
alternatively, it may reflect an inherent lower immunogencity of the mumps
virus component of the triple MMR vaccine.
