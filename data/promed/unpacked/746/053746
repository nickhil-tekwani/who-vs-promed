Influenza Update number 132 - 21 Apr 2011

Summary
-------
- Worldwide influenza activity is generally low and decreasing.
- Influenza activity in the northern hemisphere temperate regions is
back to baseline levels in most areas, indicating the season is now
ending.
- In countries of the tropical zone, influenza activity is generally
low with a few recent localized areas of activity reported and ongoing
transmission of H3N2 in central Africa.
- In southern hemisphere temperate countries, influenza seasonal
activity has not yet started.
- Viruses which have been characterized antigenically continue to be
largely related to the lineages found in the current trivalent
seasonal vaccine.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America:

http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/2011_04_21_influenza_north_america_circulation_main.pdf].

Influenza activity continues to decrease in both Canada and the
United States of America (USA). In Canada, the influenza-like illness
(ILI) consultation rate declined compared to previous weeks and is now
slightly below the expected rate for this time of year. The number of
new virus detections, outbreaks and pediatric hospitalizations all
decreased during epidemiological week (EW) 14.

Ten percent of clinical samples tested were positive for influenza,
of which influenza B now accounts for a greater proportion than
influenza A. This represents a change in the relative proportions of
the 2 virus subtypes since the beginning of the season. Overall in
that time period, 89 percent of virus detections were influenza type A
and 11 percent influenza type B. Notably, H1N1 (2009) has accounted
for only 5 percent of all virus detections or 15 percent of all
subtyped A viruses.

Since the beginning of the season, 618 pediatric hospitalizations
with laboratory-confirmed influenza have been reported from
participating provinces; 16 percent confirmed as influenza A(H3N2), 4
percent A(H1N1)2009, 54 percent as unsubtyped influenza A, and 26
percent influenza B. This is somewhat different from the pattern of
virus detections in the adult hospitalized cases, in which A(H3N2) was
detected in 21 percent, H1N1 (2009) in 5 percent, unsubtyped influenza
type A in 67 percent, and influenza type B in only 6 percent.

In the United States of America, the proportion of all outpatient
visits due to ILI is below the national baseline of 2.5 percent, and
all 10 regions reported ILI activity below regional baseline levels.
The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza
declined to near baseline levels after being at or above the epidemic
threshold for 11 consecutive weeks. Overall, 9 percent of samples
tested positive for influenza during EW 14, down from 14 percent in
the previous week. Of these, influenza type B was detected in 37
percent of the samples. Of the influenza A samples, 28 percent were
influenza A(H1N1)2009, 41 percent were influenza A(H3N2) and the
remaining 31 percent were not subtyped.

In Mexico, there is a low number of virus detections but increasing
proportion of influenza A(H1N1)2009. The H1N1 (2009) outbreak in the
northern state of Chihuahua reported last month [March 2011] has
primarily affected Juarez and Chihuahua. The outbreak has included 6
H1N1 (2009) associated deaths, all adults who were previously healthy
and including one pregnant woman.

Europe:
------
[See figure: South west Europe circulation of influenza viruses
(snapshot) pdf, 95kb
http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/2011_04_21_influenza_south_west_europe_circulation_main.pdf].

Influenza activity in the European Region continues to decline, and
activity has returned to baseline in 36 of 50 countries. 13 percent of
sentinel specimens from patients with ILI or Acute Respiratory
Infection (ARI) tested positive for influenza, and 3 percent of
specimens from sentinel SARI patients tested positive for influenza in
EW14, down from 15 percent in the previous [period].

As overall detections of influenza virus decrease, the proportion of
influenza type B virus detections has increased proportionately and
now accounts for 70 percent of all the influenza virus detections in
EW 14. Overall for the season, a total of 82 759 influenza virus
detections have been reported since the beginning of the season in the
last week of September 2010, of which 71 percent were influenza A and
29 percent were influenza B. Of 46 843 influenza A viruses that were
subtyped, 96 percent were influenza A(H1N1), 4 percent were influenza
A(H3N2).

72 percent of 4766 severe acute respiratory infection cases
hospitalized since the beginning of the influenza season in reporting
countries of the European Union and European Economic Area were
infected with an influenza virus. Of 3072 typed and sub-typed
influenza viruses from the hospitalized cases, 90 percent were
influenza A(H1N1)2009, one percent were influenza A(H3N2), and 10
percent were influenza B viruses. As in North America, the large
majority of viruses tested in Europe are antigenically similar to
those in the current trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine.

North Africa and the Middle East:
--------------------------------
Influenza virus transmission in North Africa has generally been
similar to the pattern observed across Europe, primarily associated
with H1N1 (2009) with smaller amounts of influenza type B. Peak
transmission occurred somewhat later in Algeria and Tunisia but has
now subsided to very low levels across the region.

Northern Asia:
-------------
[See figure: Eastern Asia circulation of influenza viruses (snapshot)
pdf, 115kb
http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/2011_04_21_influenza_eastern_asia_circulation_main.pdf].

Transmission in northern Asia has also returned to baseline or near
baseline levels in Mongolia, northern China, Republic of Korea, and
Japan. Of the very small number of viruses detected in those
countries, most are influenza type B, though H3N2 and H1N1 (2009) have
also been reported recently. Bhutan has reported a recent boarding
school-associated outbreak of H1N1 (2009) in early April 2011.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Influenza activity in the tropical zones of the world is largely
localized to a few countries. In the Americas, there is no significant
community transmission of influenza reported from Central America or
the Caribbean, however, Venezuela recently reported an increase in
cases of influenza A(H1N1)2009 in parts of the country associated with
at least 12 deaths. All of the deaths are reported to have occurred in
individuals with pre-existing medical conditions.

The surveillance system in Venezuela reports that 33 percent of SARI
admissions detected by the sentinel surveillance system were positive
for H1N1 (2009). The epidemic appears to have peaked in early April
2011. Other countries in tropical South America do not report similar
increases.

In sub-Saharan Africa, influenza A(H3N2) is circulating in the
central part of the continent as evidenced by increases of virus
detections in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. Further to
the east, Kenya H1N1 (2009) is circulating with influenza type B,
primarily of the Victoria lineage. The previously reported
transmission of H3N2 and influenza type B in Madagascar appears to
have lessened somewhat, although both viruses continue to be detected
there. Influenza activity in the tropical areas of Asia is at baseline
levels in all of the countries reporting, indicating that transmission
is at a very low level or absent in most of the zone.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Influenza activity remains low in most regions in the temperate zone
of the southern hemisphere. Australia continues to report on low but
unusual levels of influenza A(H3N2) viruses, with the majority of the
detections from the Northern Territory and Queensland, the tropical
and subtropical areas of the country.

Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide
and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on
available epidemiological and virological data sources, including
FluNet (reported by the Global Influenza Surveillance Network) and
influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States.
Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of
data available at the time when the update is developed.
