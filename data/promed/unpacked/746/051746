S. Korea Finds _E.coli_ O26 Infection in Patient
------------------------------------------------
South Korea has found a patient with _E. coli_ O26 bacteria, according to
the National Institute of Health (South Korea) Wednesday. A man was
hospitalized last month after he suffered bloody diarrhea due to food
poisoning.
His symptoms were diagnosed as typical _E. coli_ O26 bacterial infection,
similar to _E. coli_ O157 disease which was first found in the United
States in 1982.
The man is the second _E. coli_ O26 patient found in the country since 1999
when _E. coli_ O26 infection was designated a communicable disease. In
1987, the nation registered a child afflicted with the disease. In 1997,
the country was shocked when beef imported from the United States showed
traces of _E. coli_ O26 bacteria.
