On 25 Jun 2018, the [UK] Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Animal and Plant Health Agency Advice Services -- International Disease Monitoring, published a report entitled "Preliminary Outbreak Assessment Peste de Petits Ruminants in Bulgaria." The following comes from that report:

"The Bulgarian Authorities have reported a case of peste de petits ruminants (PPR) in sheep in Yambol region on the border with the Thrace region of Turkey. In a flock of 540 sheep and goats, 2 animals tested positive and one died, with disease confirmed by the EU Reference Laboratory. This is the 1st occurrence of PPR in Bulgaria and in the EU.

According to the disease report, the sheep/goats were co-grazing with 3 other flocks in an area where there are many small holdings. Disease control measures are in place, including protection and surveillance zones and culling all in-contact small ruminants.

Peste de petits ruminants (PPR) is a serious (non-zoonotic) viral disease of sheep and goats causing production loss, and mortality of more than 50 percent in affected flocks in non-endemic regions. PPR is the current focus for global disease eradication, following the success with the related morbillivirus, rinderpest. Vaccination with live attenuated vaccines is available for prevention and control of disease, although there is no approved DIVA [differentiating infected from vaccinated animals] vaccine available in the EU. Instead, as an exotic notifiable disease, control in the EU is based on eradication, according to European legislation Directive, 92/119/EEC. There are 4 lineages of PPR virus strains, lineages I and II are found in West Africa; lineage III in East Africa, the Middle East and South India and; lineage IV in Asia. However, lineage IV viruses have been detected in Morocco in 2008 and even in sub-Saharan Africa."
