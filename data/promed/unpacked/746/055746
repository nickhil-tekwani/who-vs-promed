New tomato virus identified in Arizona
--------------------------------------
A new plant virus identified in fall 2006 in Arizona threatens not only
home gardens, but also the commercial tomato industry in the state. Tomato
yellow leaf curl virus, also known as TYLCV, was found in 2 home gardens in
the Phoenix area.
Tomato plants infected by the TYLCV develop severely curled, yellowing
leaves, shattered nodes, and short stalks. The virus causes many of the
flowers to abort, lowering fruit set and reducing yields. Symptoms are most
apparent on the growing tips of plants, where the newest growth is taking
place.
"You'll see very small, stunted plants that aren't going to be able to
produce fruit -- not good enough for shipping and storage," says Judith
Brown, a virologist and whitefly vector biologist in the department of
plant sciences at the University of Arizona. "The virus stresses the plants
beyond belief, and they simply stop growing."
Brown isolated DNA and identified the virus from plant samples submitted by
Mary Ann Garewal, a UA-certified master gardener in Surprise, who observed
symptoms and collected samples from her vegetable garden and those of
another Phoenix gardener. At about the same time, Brown also identified a
distinctly different isolate of the virus on infected commercial tomato
plant samples from Sonora, Mexico, suggesting that the 2 isolates came from
different sources.
The plant samples from both Arizona (USA) and Mexico were also infested
with the "B" biotype of the sweet potato whitefly, _Bemicia tabaci_, which
feeds on the leaves and can transmit the virus to other plants through its
saliva.
TYLCV 1st infected tomatoes in the western hemisphere in the Caribbean and
along the eastern coasts of both the United States and Mexico in the early
90s. "It seemed to be contained in those areas until it was introduced in
Texas last summer," Brown says. The source of that outbreak was traced to
infected commercial transplants that were possibly infected by the virus in
plants brought in from out of state.
TYLCV has also been tracked from the east coast states of Mexico to the
Pacific coast production area in the state of Sinaloa, where the virus
ravaged commercial tomato crops throughout the state during spring 2005 and
again in fall and spring 2006, according to Brown. "In the summer of 2006
we next found it in Sonora," she says. "Now it's becoming a giant epidemic
across the Pacific coastal Mexican states, causing heavy yield losses in
fresh-market tomatoes and peppers that are exported to the United States."
Brown notes that the TYLCV identified in Arizona did not come from Mexico.
DNA testing matches it with isolates from Texas. When viruses pass through
different hosts, particularly ornamentals or new hosts, they can mutate
into different isolates and then be introduced back into a crop. "It's a
very prolific virus," Brown says. "If TYLCV infects a variety of tomato
that is not resistant, you'll have a huge problem. I don't think any of the
varieties grown hydroponically in greenhouses are resistant, although some
of the field processing varieties are. None of the current home garden
varieties are resistant."
TYLCV infects not only tomatoes, but also beans and peppers in home
gardens, and some ornamentals.
Brown advises against spraying whiteflies to control the virus because by
the time the symptoms appear it is too late to stop the disease. She adds
that there are currently no chemical or biological controls for TYLCV. "The
best approach is to avoid introducing the virus in transplants. Virus-free
seedlings are the way to go," she says. "You're safest if you buy
virus-free plants or start your own from seed -- although that still may
not help if your garden or crop is near an infected field or a neighbor's
garden that harbors the virus."

[The crop plant tomato, _Lycopersicon esculentum_, is susceptible to the
disease yellow leaf curl, caused by the tomato yellow leaf curl virus
(TYLCV) (family: _Geminiviridae_, genus: _Begomovirus_). TYLCV can cause
serious fruit loss and is the main limiting factor in tomato production in
many parts of the world. It frequently enters new areas on transplants, a
concern expressed in the article above. The whitefly _Bemisia tabaci_ is
the efficient vector of the virus.
This report documents the western spread of TYLCV in the USA, with specific
reference to Arizona where it is reported for the 1st time in samples
collected in the fall of 2006. The virus is very damaging to the vegetables
it infects, especially to susceptible tomato varieties.
Whitefly-transmitted viruses such as TYLCV are very difficult to control
and this problem is described in the well written report that is the
subject of this posting.
