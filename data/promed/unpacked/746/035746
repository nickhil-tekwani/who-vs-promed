Aldi, Woolworths and Costco recall products containing toxic spinach
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A 3rd supermarket has been added to the list of sites where a toxic batch of spinach has been recalled after almost 50 people fell ill after eating it.

Aldi has recalled 450g packets of The Fresh Salad Co-branded Fresh & Fast Stir Fry sold in stores across Victoria.

It includes all products with use by dates of up to and including 24 Dec 2022.

To date [17 Dec 2022], as part of the ongoing investigation, there are 47 people in NSW who have reported symptoms after eating baby spinach.

More than a 1/3 of these (at least 17) have sought medical attention.

Earlier this morning [17 Dec 2022], residents in Victoria, New South Wales, ACT and Queensland were urged to immediately throw away 2 products containing the toxic leaf.

The 2 products are the Woolworths Chicken Cobb Salad 270g (ID 218366) with use by dates of 20 Dec 2022 and the Woolworths Chickpea Falafel 290g (ID 218371) with use by dates of 20 Dec 2022 and 22 Dec 2022.

On Friday [16 Dec 2022], NSW residents were urged to throw out spinach products bought from Costco after a number of cases of "possible food-related toxic reactions".

NSW Health warned Riviera Farms-branded baby spinach should not be eaten, as the product is "not safe to consume".

There have been 9 people from 4 unrelated households across Sydney who have required medical treatment after developing poisoning [signs after] having eaten the product.

Dr Darren Roberts from the NSW Poisons Information Centre, told the Sydney Morning Herald those affected had been "quite sick".

"No one has died, so we're very happy with that and we hope it remains that way, but these people are quite sick ... to the point of marked hallucinations, where they are seeing things that aren't there," he said.

Affected products were sold through Costco with an expiry date of 16 Dec 2022.

"Initial investigations suggest the presence of an accidental contaminant in the food product," NSW Health said.

"NSW Health is working with the NSW Food Authority, as well as other jurisdictions, to investigate the issue further."

Anyone who is concerned about exposure to the spinach should call the Poisons Information Centre.

NSW Health urges anyone who experiences any unusual and severe symptoms to seek immediate medical attention by visiting their nearest emergency department.

Reported symptoms can be severe, including:
- Delirium or confusion
- Hallucinations
- Dilated pupils
- Rapid heartbeat
- Flushed face
- Blurred vision
- Dry mouth and skin
- Fever

NSW Health advises the impacted baby spinach was sold through Costco with an expiry date of 16 Dec 2022.

The product is not safe to consume and people who have it should throw it out.

Anyone who is concerned about exposure to the spinach should call the Poisons Information Centre.

Riviera Farms recalls baby spinach products
-------------------------------------------
Riviera Farms has been working with retailers and regulators to identify, and recall, potentially contaminated spinach products from shelves.

Riviera Farms is now issuing a recall of all baby spinach products with a best before date up to, and including, 28 Dec 2022.

This is a precautionary measure and is an update on earlier advice where we stated the products with a best before date of 16 Dec 2022 were impacted.

It appears these products, which were grown on a farm in Victoria and shipped to stores in NSW, have been contaminated with a weed which can have health consequences if consumed.

The relevant advice from NSW Health regarding the potential contaminant and health impacts can be found at https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/news/Pages/20221215_00.aspx.

Samples have been sent to laboratories for testing.

Riviera Farms advised authorities immediately after being alerted by 1 of our retailers and we will continue to work closely with health and food regulators as investigations continue.

Riviera Farms has been in the business of providing fresh food since the 1880s and has been saddened by this incident, which is our 1st in our long history of providing fresh food products.

We continue to work pro-actively and transparently with our customers and regulators on this issue.

The advice from Food Standards Australia New Zealand is that "Consumers should not eat this product and should return the products to the place of purchase for a full refund. Any consumers concerned about their health should seek medical advice."

[An interesting case without a solid answer at the present time. We hope the source of the problem is found and dealt with quickly.

A toxic plant looking like spinach has infiltrated the growing area? Or perhaps something was sprayed on the spinach causing a reaction?

One possibility is the incorporation of one of the many plants in the genus _Solanum_ sp, also known as the nightshades or the belladona plants. If any of a number of these plants grew along side the spinach and was harvested with the spinach then these plants may have contaminated the spinach. The nightshades contain atropine, which could produce the signs noted, fever, headache, hallucinations, and "meaningless speech. The mnemonic trick often used to remember the signs caused by the nightshade group is, " Hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as a beet, and mad as a hatter" because the signs of nightshade poisoning are fever, headache, hallucinations, and "meaningless speech." There are a number of different nightshade which could have infiltrated the fields and been harvested with the spinach.

Hopefully, there will not be any further cases since a recall has been issued. We wish those affected a speedy recovery.. - Mod.TG
