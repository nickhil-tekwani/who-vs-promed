Public health physicians of Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP)
who are fighting the epidemic of yellow fever [YF] in the interior of
Sao Paulo [state] were surprised on Tuesday [31 Mar 2009] to see the
transmission of disease from a mother to her child. The discovery is
unprecedented. "This type of transmission scared us because it has
never been reported before in the medical literature," said Tania
Ruiz, Coordinator of the Center for Epidemiological Surveillance of
the Hospital of Unesp in Botucatu (Sao Paulo).

According to the Coordinator, the serological tests proved that a
baby, son of a [YF] infected mother, was born with the disease. The
serological tests are results of studies by researchers from UNESP
and other institutions of the country According to Tania, the
immediate importance of discovery is in the procedures adopted in
epidemics the disease. "From now on, we need to take more care with
pregnant [YF cases]," she explained.

The epidemic of yellow fever in Sao Paulo began on 27 February
[2009]. This Tuesday [31 Mar 2009], 2 more cases were reported. The
total documented confirmed deaths from the disease reached 8 in the
cities of Piraju, Sarutaia and Itatinga in the southern part of the
state. So far, 15 total reported [YF cases] were confirmed.

Mass vaccination is still being done in health posts and even
supermarkets. According to Tania, over 90 percent of residents of
these municipalities are immunized, which reduces the risks [of YF
infection]. However, most health concern is to prevent the disease,
currently considered to be a sylvan [jungle transmission cycle], that
might move into an urban area.

So far, all cases are related to victims who were in rural areas.
According to public health officials, the expansion of the disease
into urban areas would be "a disaster."

[This is not surprising, nor is it a reason for alarm. The yellow
fever virus is a flavivirus; other flaviviruses, such as dengue
virus, can have transplacental transmission.

The poor infant, now an orphan, is not a public health threat for
urbanization of yellow fever, should it happen, it would certainly
not be by means of a case (rare) of vertical transmission. - Mod.LJS]
