Multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis infections linked to pet guinea pigs
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, several states, and the US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis infections. CDC began investigating in December 2017 when CDC PulseNet identified a cluster of 3 _Salmonella_ Enteritidis infections that whole genome sequencing showed were closely related genetically.

A review of the PulseNet database identified 9 more closely related illnesses dating back to 2015. These illnesses were added to the outbreak case count.

To date, 9 people infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Enteritidis have been reported from 8 states. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 17 Jul 2015 to 15 Dec 2017. 1 person was hospitalized, and no deaths were reported.

States / Case count
Colorado / 2
Indiana / 1
Iowa / 1
Massachusetts / 1
Michigan / 1
New York / 1
Virginia / 1
Vermont / 1
------------------
Total / 9

Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicate that contact with pet guinea pigs is the likely source of this multistate outbreak. 4 of the 7 people interviewed reported contact with a guinea pig or its habitat in the week before getting sick. The outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ was identified in a sample collected from an ill person's pet guinea pig in Vermont.

Whole genome sequencing showed that _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from sick people and the guinea pig were closely related genetically. This result provides more evidence that people in this outbreak got sick from contact with pet guinea pigs. Whole genome sequencing did not identify predicted antimicrobial resistance in 11 of 13 isolates analyzed (9 ill people and 4 guinea pigs). One isolate from a sick person and one isolate from a guinea pig contained genes for resistance to streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Testing of outbreak isolates using standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System laboratory confirmed these results.

This outbreak is a reminder that pet rodents such as guinea pigs, regardless of where they are purchased or adopted, can carry _Salmonella_ bacteria even when they look healthy and clean. Follow CDC's tips to keep you and your pet safe and healthy:

Advice to pet owners:
---------------------
Pick the right pet for you.
- Pet rodents, including guinea pigs, are not recommended for families with children younger than 5 years, pregnant women, elderly adults, or people with weakened immune systems because these groups are at greater risk for serious illness.
- Pet rodents should not be kept in childcare centers, schools, or other facilities with children younger than 5 years.

Wash your hands.
- Always wash your hands immediately after touching, feeding, or caring for pet rodents or cleaning their habitats.

Play safely.
- Do not kiss, nuzzle, or hold pet rodents close to your face. This can startle your pet and increase the chance it will bite you. Bites from pet rodents can spread germs and possibly make you sick.

Never eat, drink, or smoke while playing with or caring for your pet rodent.
- Keep pet rodents, food and water bowls, and other supplies out of the kitchen or other areas where food is prepared, served, or consumed.

Be aware that pet rodents can carry germs that can contaminate surfaces in areas where they live and roam.
- You don't have to touch pet rodents to get sick from their germs.
- Make sure rodent enclosures are properly secured and safe so your pet doesn't get hurt or contaminate surfaces.

Clean and disinfect rodent habitats, food and water bowls, and other supplies outside your home when possible.
- If you clean rodent supplies indoors, use a laundry sink or bathtub, and thoroughly clean and disinfect the area immediately after.
- Never clean rodent habitats or their supplies in the kitchen sink, other food preparation areas, or the bathroom sink.

Talk to your veterinarian about your pet rodent's health.
- Your veterinarian can play a key role in helping you and your pets stay healthy.

Tell your healthcare provider that you have been around pet rodents, whether at home or away from the home, especially if you are sick or have been bitten or scratched.
- Some germs carried by pet rodents can cause serious and life-threatening illness in people.

Options for unwanted guinea pigs
--------------------------------
Releasing unwanted pet rodents into the wild is not recommended. Many pet retailers, pet stores, local animal shelters, zoos, or animal rescues accept unwanted pets. Talk to your veterinarian about other options.

[The guinea pig, _Cavia porcellus_, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig), also called the cavy, is a species of rodent belonging to the family _Caviidae_. Despite their common name, these animals are not in the pig family, nor are they from Guinea. They originated in the Andes, and earlier studies based on biochemistry and hybridization suggested they are domesticated descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as _Cavia aperea_, _C. fulgida_, or _C. tschudii_ and, therefore, do not exist naturally in the wild.

The animals were originally domesticated for their meat in the Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s it has become more socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be a major part of the diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cows. Guinea pig meat is high in protein and low in fat and cholesterol, and is described as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken. The animal may be served fried, broiled, or roasted, and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee. Ecuadorians commonly consume 'sopa' or 'locro de cuy', a soup dish. 'Pachamanca' or 'huatia', a process similar to barbecuing, is also popular, and is usually served with corn beer (chicha) in traditional settings.

As early as 1927, if not earlier, salmonellosis has been recognized to cause infection in guinea pigs (1). Although some infections have been related to common serotypes of _S. enterica_ such as Enteritidis and Typhimurium, more unusual serotypes have been described including Amager (2), Narashino (3), and Limete (4). Salmonellosis spread from guinea pigs to humans is certainly recognized (5, 6) but the moderator could not find English language reports of spread from guinea pig as a foodstuff. It is possible that contamination of the rodent occurred during processing and did not originate in the guinea pig(s) in vivo as has occurred with outbreaks of salmonellosis from fish (see ProMED-mail Salmonellosis, serotype Paratyphi B - USA: raw tuna 20100428.1371).

"Abstract
-----------
_Salmonella_ outbreaks have been linked to a wide variety of foods, including recent nationwide outbreaks. Guinea pig (_Cavia porcellus_), also known as cuy or cobayo, has long been a popular delicacy and ceremonial food in the Andean region in South America. This case report describes three family outbreaks of nontyphoidal salmonellosis, each occurring after a meal of guinea pigs. We believe this case report is the 1st to describe a probable association between the consumption of guinea pig meat and human salmonellosis. Physicians should be aware of the association of _Salmonella_ and the consumption of guinea pigs, given the increasing immigration of people from the Andean region of South America and the increasing travel to this region." - Mod.LL
