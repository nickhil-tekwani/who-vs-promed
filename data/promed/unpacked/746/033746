Source of Legionnaires outbreak identified

Health officials investigating how four patients at Harford Memorial
Hospital contracted Legionnaires disease, now say a water storage tank is
to blame for the outbreak. The disease could have been spread through the
hospital's water system.
State health and Harford Memorial Hospital officials announced Friday that
a hot water tank cooled and allowed the _Legionnella_ bacteria to grow.
Two patients died from the disease - one on June 26th and the second on
July 6th. One patient remains in intensive care in critical but stable
condition. Officials are still investigating whether the fourth case can be
linked to the hospital.
The hospital flushed their water system earlier this week with 150 degree
water to kill any lingering bacteria. Officials are awaiting tests on the
system following the cleaning. The suspected hot water tank has been taken
out of service.
Legionnaires is a form of pneumonia caused by a common bacteria often
found in air conditioning cooling towers, hot water tanks, and humidifiers.
