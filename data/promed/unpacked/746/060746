[1] Case update
- Sat 4 Aug 2018. Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs), edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/don/4-august-2018-ebola-drc/en/

On 28 Jul 2018, the North Kivu Provincial Health Division notified the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo of a cluster of suspected acute haemorrhagic fever cases. On 1 Aug 2018, the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB) in Kinshasa reported that 4 of 6 samples collected from hospitalised patients tested positive by GeneXpert automated PCR. These presumptive positive tests prompted an immediate escalation of response activities by the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners, and the declaration of the outbreak by the minister of health.

The prompt alert by the Ministry of Health to WHO, under the International Health Regulations, followed the detection and rapid investigation of a cluster of suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in a family in North Kivu province during mid to late July 2018. Local health officials have since identified sporadic, antecedent deaths in the community since May 2018 (tentatively classified as probable cases), which are subject to ongoing investigations to determine if they are related to the current outbreak.

The Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners are working to establish the full extent of this outbreak. As of 3 Aug 2018, 43 Ebola virus disease cases (13 confirmed and 30 probable), including 33 deaths, have been reported. An additional 33 suspected cases are currently pending laboratory testing to confirm or exclude Ebola virus disease. A total of 3 healthcare workers have been affected, of whom one has died. Geographically, confirmed and probable cases are currently localised to 5 health zones in North Kivu province (38 cases, including 13 confirmed and 25 probable), and one health zone in Ituri province (5 probable cases) (figure -- see source URL above). Suspected cases are currently under investigation in one additional health zone of Ituri Province. The affected areas host over one million displaced people and shares borders with Rwanda and Uganda, with frequent cross border movement due to trade activities. The prolonged humanitarian crisis and deterioration of the security situation is expected to hinder response to this outbreak.

Further laboratory testing by INRB has detected Ebola virus using conventional PCR in 3 of the initial batch of 6 samples from Mabalako health zone. These results are highly suggestive that [Ebola virus (_Zaire ebolavirus_)] is the cause of this outbreak; however, genetic sequencing is necessary to definitively confirm the virus species.

Characterization of viral sequences will help to inform the potential use of vaccines and therapeutics, and any link to the recent outbreak in Equateur Province -- located in the far west of the country, some 2500 km [about 1553 mi] from the current outbreak. Currently there is no evidence to suggest that these events are related.

- 5 Aug 2018 1243 GMT. 33 reported dead in Congo Ebola outbreak
[CNN, edited]

The Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed 33 people, the World Health Organization said [on Sun 5 Aug 2018]. An additional 43 suspected cases of Ebola were reported, including 13 confirmed by lab testing, according to WHO.

The outbreak is spreading through 5 health zones in North Kivu province and one health zone in Ituri province, which poses geographic and political challenges, WHO said. North Kivu borders Rwanda and Uganda and trade activity fuels heavy movement across the borders. North Kivu also hosts over 1 million displaced people and fighting between government forces and armed militant groups makes containing the highly infectious virus a challenge.

"We're responding to an outbreak of this high-threat pathogen, with one of the highest mortality rates of any known disease, but in the context of a war zone," Peter Salama, head of emergencies at WHO said.

Health officials announced the outbreak [Wed 1 Aug 2018], about a week after the government of Congo declared another Ebola outbreak in Equateur province had been contained. That outbreak was about 2500 km (1553 miles) from the current outbreak.

There are 33 additional "suspected cases" in the North Kivu outbreak that are pending lab test results to "confirm or exclude Ebola virus disease," according to WHO. Three healthcare workers have been affected, including 2 who died, WHO said. "The Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners are working to establish the full extent of this outbreak", the WHO statement read.

- 6 Aug 2018. 13:22 WAT. DRC: No reported case of Ebola in Ituri, says governor Abdallah Pene Mbaka
[Radio Okapi, in French, machine trans., edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2018/08/06/actualite/sante/rdc-aucun-cas-declare-debola-en-ituri-selon-le-gouverneur-abdallah-pene

Contrary to the rumors circulating about possible cases of Ebola in Ituri, no case is declared there, assured the governor of this province Abdallah Pene Mbaka. During a press briefing held on Sun 5 Aug, he still invited the people to wash their hands, avoid contact with people who are suspicious or who died of this disease.

"The Ebola outbreak is not declared in Ituri. These are just rumors that announce it. People were contaminated in Mangina, died in Mangina and were buried in Mangina. At this stage, information that reaches us from different health structures, there is no case of Ebola virus at home in Ituri, not even a suspected case", quieted the governor.

In its bulletin published last [Sat 4 Aug 2018], the Ministry of Health announced that laboratories are already operational in several cities in the provinces of North Kivu, Tshopo and Ituri, to prevent the spread of the disease. In this regard, Abdallah Pene Mbaka urged his people not to consume dead game meat or bats. He urged all residents of Ituri to alert the health authorities of any suspected cases of vomiting or diarrhea in families.

[One has to wonder whether this is correct as the WHO and the Ministry of Health have reported 5 cases in Ituri (see ProMED mail Ebola update (60): DR Congo (NK) case update, response, risk 20180805.5948198). Strong control measures should be implemented regardless. - Mod.LK]

[2] Response
5 Aug 2018. ACAPS Briefing Note
[Start Network - ACAPS, edited]
https://www.acaps.org/sites/acaps/files/products/files/20180803_acaps_start_briefing_note_drc_ebola_nord_kivu.pdf

On 1 Aug 2018, a new Ebola Virus outbreak was declared in Mabalako health zone, Beni territory, Nord Kivu, when 4 samples collected from patients suffering from an 'unknown disease' tested positive for the virus. So far, 33 cases including 20 deaths (case fatality rate [CFR] 60.6 per cent) have been reported, though the latest official press release states 26 cases and 20 deaths as of 28 Jul 2018. The declaration of this outbreak followed detection of a significant cluster of suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in July [2018] in Nord Kivu. Investigations found that sporadic deaths in May [2018] in the affected communities may have been related. A strike affecting the health sector in Nord Kivu is one factor why the detection and response to the virus has been impeded.

Crisis impact
-------------
On 1 Aug 2018, an Ebola virus outbreak was declared in Nord Kivu, after 4 out of 6 samples from patients affected by an 'unknown disease' tested positive. This outbreak is the 2nd one in DRC since the beginning of 2018, and comes barely one week after the last Ebola virus outbreak in Equateur province was officially declared over. The current outbreak is located some 2500 km [approx. 1550 mi] from Equateur province and any connection is unclear. However, initial tests identified the strain of the virus as serotype Zaire, the same that affected the Equateur province and which was contained due to the successful application of Merck's vaccine. Further tests are ongoing to confirm the specific strain of the virus. Merck's vaccine is only effective against the Zaire strain. (Ministry of Health 2 Aug 2018, Reuters 2 Aug 2018, Radio Okapi 1 Aug 2018, Le Monde 1 Aug 2018)

Ministry of Health officials have reported 33 cases including 20 deaths (CFR: 60.6 per cent) to ECHO, although the latest official press release citing figures from 28 Jul 2018 reports only 26 cases (20 deaths). The outbreak is currently only reported in Beni territory, in the north of Nord Kivu province, near Lake Edward and the border with Uganda. Three areas within the health district of Mabalako (30 km -- 18.6 mi -- from Beni, a city of over 230 000 people) are affected so far: Mangina, Bingo, and Mangodomu. Most cases are reported in Mangina alone. (IFRC 2 Aug 2018, WHO 1 Aug 2018, DG ECHO 2 Aug 2018) However, it is likely that the case numbers and the spread of the outbreak, at least in the immediate affected areas, will evolve quickly. Updated information is expected to be frequently released. At the time of publication the 1st reports of cases in Ituri were released, though remained unofficial.

Health: Trained health staff, medical supplies, and functioning health infrastructure are needed to respond to the outbreak. However, in Beni territory, health infrastructure is for the most part inadequate, and struggles to deliver quality services. There are 7 hospitals and 133 health centres in Beni territory. Health facilities are often confronted with shortages of medical supplies, and they lack equipment and qualified staff to respond properly to the outbreak (CAID 31 Mar 2017). Even though the outbreak may have originated in May [2018], and a significant cluster of suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in North Kivu Province was detected and rapidly investigated in mid to late July [2018], the declaration of the outbreak only occurred in August [2018]. One factor is that some of the health staff in Nord Kivu have been on strike since last May [2018] to protest working conditions and unpaid salaries. Some medical personnel undertook response activities due to the outbreak despite remaining on strike, simultaneously using the opportunity to underline their poor working conditions. (Actualite CD 2 Aug 2018, Le Monde 1 Aug 2018)

WASH [water, sanitation and hygiene]: In DRC, about 13.1 million people are in need of WASH support. (OCHA 19 Jan 2018). Adequate WASH infrastructure and access are crucial to prevent Ebola virus from spreading. Particularly safe disposal of medical waste in areas affected by the outbreak is crucial. However, water and sanitation infrastructure poor in parts of Nord Kivu, including in places hosting IDPs. (OCHA 10 Jul 2018)

Protection: As of 2 Aug 2018, most cases are concentrated in Mabalako health district, where the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF, an armed group founded in the 1990s in Uganda) has been historically active, including with attacks on local populations (IRIN 9 Apr 2016, Le Monde 1 Aug 2018, Le Figaro 1 Aug 2018). The latest incident was on 16 Jul 2018, when ADF rebels attacked an FARDC base near Beni, killing 3 soldiers and 3 civilians (Security Council, 2 Aug 2018). Insecurity and ongoing armed conflict in Beni territory is causing frequent displacement, but also paralysing socioeconomic activities, making the response to the outbreak even more challenging (OCHA 28 May 2018) Tensions between the DRC and Uganda armed forces are also high: since early July [2018], over 30 people have been killed around Lake Edward in clashes between the 2 armies.

Humanitarian and operational constraints
Humanitarian access in Nord Kivu and Ituri is limited; much of DRC's 1700 km [about 1050 mi] road network is in poor condition. Most roads are made of dirt, and only 11 per cent are paved (OCHA 31 Jul 2018) Most humanitarian access in Nord Kivu depends on air, but air access is also affected by the rainy season (expected to begin in September and last until January), the poor quality of landing tracks, and financial constraints, all of which impede the delivery of aid (OCHA 31 Jul 2018, FEWSNET December 2016).

The security environment is also a major constraint for humanitarian actors. Ongoing violence and clashes between the Congolese army and armed militias are a threat to the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Some affected areas in Nord Kivu (displacement sites in particular) are inaccessible to humanitarian actors because of insecurity. Since January 2018, it was reported that over 18 000 people living in Beni had almost no access to humanitarian assistance due to security constraints. Access is severely restricted in most of the conflict-affected areas; in Ituri as well. Unlike the outbreak in Equateur, where the security situation was mostly stable, one of the main challenges of the response in Nord Kivu is the difficulty for humanitarian agencies to access populations in need (OCHA 31 Jul 2018, OCHA 9 Apr 2018, The Guardian 2 Aug 2018).

Violence against humanitarian actors is a recurring issue in Nord Kivu. Robberies, lootings, kidnapping, and killings are regularly reported. During the first 3 months of 2018, 3 kidnappings were reported, and 2 local NGO workers were killed. In 2017, 7 kidnappings were reported (OCHA 31 Jul 2018).

Attacks on health facilities and aid workers have been regularly reported in Nord Kivu in 2018, particularly in Goma, Rutshuru, and Mushikiri villages. Ongoing intercommunal violence and conflict has a detrimental impact on the access to health care. (Insecurity Insight May 2018, Insecurity Insight Mar 2018, Insecurity Insight Feb 2018, WHO Feb 2018, MSF 16 Jan 2017)

Aggravating factors
-------------------
Existing vulnerabilities
In Nord Kivu, over 31 per cent of the population (2.6 million out of 8.3 million total) are in need of humanitarian assistance. (OCHA 31 Jul 2018)

...[more]

Other diseases in region
------------------------
The commonest diseases reported in Beni are malaria (60 per cent), respiratory infections (15 per cent) and diarrhoeal diseases (12 per cent) (CAID 31 Mar 2017).

The mountainous zones of Nord Kivu are hypoendemic to malaria: the incidence of the disease is relatively low and the transmission season short, which leads to low immunity and higher risk of epidemics. More than 2 million cases of malaria were registered in Nord Kivu in 2017 with Mweso, Masisi, Rutshuru, Walikale, and Kaina health zones affected the most (ACP 29 Apr 2018, US Aid 2018).

Cases of cholera, other types of haemorrhagic fevers, and an outbreak of rabies (with CFR at 18 per cent) have been reported in Nord Kivu in 2018. (IFRC 2 Aug 2018, WHO 27 Jul 2018).

...[more]

Languages spoken in the affected areas are diverse, including 7 in Beni territory; 80 per cent of the population in Beni territory speak Swahili, though Nande/Kinande is the first language for 78 per cent of the population. Mbuba is the 1st language for 20 per cent of the population and should not be overlooked in the response and information exchange with affected populations (TWB 3 Aug 2018).

...[more]

Response capacity
-----------------
Local and national response capacity
... Given the volatile security situation in the region, a new security component has been adopted to ensure protection for both responders and affected populations (DG ECHO 2 Aug 2018, The Guardian 2 Aug 2018, Ministère de la Santé République Démocratique du Congo 1 Aug 2018) A team of 12 experts, composed of epidemiologists, psychologists, and physicians, was deployed in Beni by the MoH on 2 Aug 2018 (Le Figaro 1 Aug 2018, Jeune Afrique 1 Aug 2018).

International response capacity
In Nord Kivu, 49 per cent of humanitarian projects are executed by local NGOs. There are currently 71 operational actors, including 17 actors operating in the health sector. In Beni territory, 7 organisations are currently implementing health projects (OCHA 14 May 2018). A lot of international actors were already in place for the response to the Equateur outbreak, and their medical staff and equipment have not yet been repatriated. A total of 4 Red Cross volunteers have been deployed in a Beni hospital, while MSF has started installing tents inside health centres. WHO started providing support teams to local and national health authorities as well as local Red Cross committee. Oxfam announced they started working on awareness raising activities with the local communities and providing WASH assistance (IFRC 2 Aug 2018, Oxfam 2 Aug 2018, Le Monde 1 Aug 2018).

[This is an excellent comprehensive summary of the situation from ACAPS, a Norwegian non-profit, non-governmental project that provides international, independent humanitarian analysis. ACAPS was created in 2009. The project is currently funded by 5 donors. The analysis is based on evidence and needs and is free of operational agenda. It is freely provided to the NGOs, UN agencies and donors to help them better understand the humanitarian crises, make more informed decisions and respond more effectively to disasters. It is well worth reading the entire report. - Mod.LK]

[byline: Patrick Maki]

The international organisation Medecins sans frontieres (MSF; Doctors Without Borders) is supporting the Ministry of Health in the response to the officially declared Ebola outbreak on 1 Aug 2018 in the locality of Mangina, 30 km [about 19 mi] west of the city of Beni (North Kivu).

At least 33 people have died since last May [2018] following the epidemic in this part of the country, according to official figures. MSF is currently building the Ebola treatment center in the locality of Mangina for the care of patients and suspected cases.

"For now, we are setting up the Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) and we have already made an isolation at Mangina level. Yesterday [Sun 5 Aug 2018] we were able to isolate 15 cases. For the CTE we move quickly. We are bringing the international and national team to work in the field", said Dr Salha Issoufou, MSF's chief of mission, on [Mon 6 Aug 2018].

The MSF team arrived in Beni on [Sun 31 Jul 2018] in support of government experts in the fight against the disease. The NGO is also involved in the management of malaria cases in structures not affected by Ebola in Mangina. "There are 2 areas of intervention: the care and support of non-Ebola health facilities for protection, but also the management of malaria cases because they have similar symptoms; we must ensure that cases of malaria in non-Ebola structures are supported, "said Dr Issoufou.

Vaccination against Ebola begins [on Wed 8 Aug 2018] in Mangina. According to Dr Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathé, general director of the response to this epidemic in this area, the vaccination will begin with the medical staff and all those who had the 1st contacts with the patients.
