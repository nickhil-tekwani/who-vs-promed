Uzbekistan denies reports of anthrax outbreak in country
--------------------------------------------------------
The State Veterinary Department under the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources of Uzbekistan denied reports of some media about 19 people hospitalized with suspected anthrax in Samarkand region.

The information is not true, there were no patients with symptoms of anthrax in Samarkand or in other region, said Chief of the Veterinary Department Bakhram Narkobulov. He added the livestock was vaccinated against anthrax [in accordance with the preventive measures].

Constant control over the spread of the disease is held by the Veterinary Service, and all needed measures are taken, he stressed.

In summer, the heat intensifies the danger of spread of infectious diseases among the livestock. In this regard, the regional veterinary departments have intensified prevention works. Stable epizootic and epidemiological situation remains in all regions of the country, added Narkobulov.

[We should note that our previous report was labeled 'suspected' because of the Uzbek statement: "The local health department said that the disease has not been confirmed yet." And thus, presumably the medical services were unable to confirm the initial diagnosis. But the CVD (chief veterinary doctor) only remarks on vaccination, not on any examination of the bovine carcass or meat.
