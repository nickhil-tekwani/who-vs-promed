A new strain of malaria has killed 55 people and infected more than 18 000
others in India's eastern state of West Bengal since January 2006, the World
Health Organization and the state government said on Monday. "All the deaths
could be a result of poor surveillance and drug resistance, but we are still
trying to find answers," KC Barui, state director of health services, told
Reuters.
In the famous tea district of Darjeeling, almost 2400 people have been
infected with malaria since January 2006, compared with just 700 in the same
period of 2005. Officials at the School of Tropical Medicine in Kolkata say
a new strain of _Plasmodium falciparum_, the deadliest form of the malaria,
is the likely cause of the infections.
The new strain has been tracked to Myanmar, has mutated and has become
drug-resistant. "Traditional drugs seem to have little effect and we are
trying cocktails," Prabhakar Chatterjee, a top WHO official told Reuters.

[West Bengal borders Assam, where a severe malaria epidemic was reported in
April 2006, which may suggest a further spread of malaria into West Bengal.
The posting indicates that drug-resistant _Plasmodium falciparum_ has been
identified and suggests that it originated in Myanmar.
ProMED-mail is interested in information on the pattern of drug resistance
in the _P. falciparum_ isolates -- especially whether it is only resistant
to chloroquine, or whether resistance against sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine
(Fansidar) and mefloquine (Lariam) has also been found.
