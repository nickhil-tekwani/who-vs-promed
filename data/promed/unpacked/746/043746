I agree with the author as to the minimal likelihood of getting these
diagnoses made in the current climate of health funding. Surveillance
is falling down (it was often paid for in the past by cost-shifting) in
the current system; probably it's another argument for a single-payer
plan.

Thank you for this interesting personal observation. However, most of it
concerns factors which are immanent to the sociomedical system of the US
but are less likely to be seen e.g. in continental Europe.

While I can understand your feelings, I want to point out that brain biopsy
in suspected CJD is never an easy-to-make decision, giving its invasive
character, involving some risk, and to be performed on an individual who is
not able to make decisions for himself or others. The traditional position
- not only with CJD, but also other neurodegenerative conditions as well -
is that there should be possibly treatable alternative diagnoses if a brain
biopsy is considered; otherwise it seem rather irresponsible to do it. This
traditional approach was exactly what happened in the UK when some nvCJD
cases were diagnosed by brain biopsy - in such very young people with
atypical presentations there might have been treatable alternative
diagnoses.
The problem is of course the fact that nvCJD can be diagnosed only by
tissue examination, either by biopsy or by autopsy. Given the low autopsy
rates in many countries including the US, it might be tempting to do brain
biopsies because autopsies won't be obtained - a _very cynical_ option for
me. There is no way to circumvent the need for autopsies in all suspected
TSE cases; otherwise many surveillance efforts will be futile. How about
making a legal or forensic autopsy (we call it in Austria "sanitary police
autopsy") obligatory in suspected TSEs? This is an obvious public health
problem, and many forensic autopsies are made (to my knowledge in the US by
coroners) e.g. on victims of traffic accidents - thus it shouldn't be a
problem of adequate resources. There are enough neuropathological and other
specialist laboratories in the US and elsewhere willing to diagnose
submitted cases.
I know well enough how reluctant some neurosurgeons, pathologists,
laboratory workers etc. are in working with TSE patients. With
neurosurgery, this is understandable to some degree because the whole used
instrumentarium should be discarded after the operation. With other medical
professionals, this ill-directed anxiety is much less tolerable and mostly
derives from lack of sufficient knowledge. There are enough recommendations
around how to deal safely and effectively with human TSEs. People have
become acquainted to deal with infections such as HIV which are much more
likely to be accidentally transmitted in the medical setting.

A positive CSF test for the (unspecific neuronal) 14-3-3 protein supports
but does not make certain a CJD diagnosis. From my point of view, this
should not influence the decision to biopsy or not; however, most
clinicians would consider it to argue against biopsy. However, it is
desirable to expand our knowledge on the validity of the test by autopsy
control.

Right, see above. So you correctly went for an autopsy.

We have in Europe similar problems when a person dies in a nursing home and
an autopsy is desirable. That is why an obligatory legal/forensic autopsy
might be a solution.

All this is seen in classical CJD as well.

Also in Europe, it was only during the past 15 years that medical doctors
fully realized that CJD does occur in the old; our oldest patient was 84.
This is evident from the rising percentage of old CJD patients e.g. in the
UK and Austria.

Maybe this issue, revolving around the need to have more autopsies, should
in the US become a topic for CJD patients' families groups?

Given that the CJD nervous tissue is so infective that the entire
instrument must be discarded because it cannot be surely disinfected, then
what happens to instruments used for spinal taps?
