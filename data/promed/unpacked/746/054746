The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recorded 78 more measles cases in the last week [1-7 Apr 2019], a sign that ongoing outbreaks in several states are growing.

The 2019 total number of cases has jumped to 465 in 19 states, as Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, and Nevada all reported their 1st cases of the year [2019] last week.

"This is the 2nd-greatest number of cases reported in the U.S. since measles was eliminated in 2000," the CDC said. In 2014 the agency recorded 667 measles cases, and last year saw 372 cases, now the 3rd-most since 2000. If the current pace of cases continues, the nation could top the 2014 total as soon as the end of this month or in May [2019].

Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas, and Washington have all recorded cases.

Of note this week is a growing outbreak in Michigan, where 39 cases have been reported between [13 Mar and 5 Apr 2019] in Oakland and Wayne counties. As with outbreaks in New York and New Jersey, the Michigan outbreak is connected to an imported case of measles from Israel. New York City recorded 45 more cases in an outbreak in Queens and Brooklyn that's been ongoing since October [2018]. There are now 259 cases in that outbreak, which began with an unvaccinated child who contracted the virus in Israel.

In addition to Michigan and New York City, the CDC is tracking 5 other measles outbreaks: Rockland County, New York (157 cases); Washington state (74); New Jersey (13); Butte County, California (6); and Santa Clara County, California (3).

A total of 13 people in New Jersey now have measles, as the 2nd Ocean County outbreak in less than 6 months continues to grow.

The updated numbers came [Fri 5 Apr 2019] from the state's Department of Health; 11 of the cases have been directly linked to the outbreak, declared [15 Mar 2019], while 2 others are unrelated. As many as 7 of the outbreak cases are in Ocean County, and 4 others are contained to one household in Monmouth County, which has ties to the Orthodox Jewish community in Ocean County, according to the Department of Health. Two other cases were reported previously in Bergen and Essex counties.

A spokesperson for the department confirmed [Mon 8 Apr 2019] afternoon that the number stood at 13.

Those people associated with the outbreak, along with another person who is suspected of having contracted measles, would have exposed others to the virus that causes measles between [9 and 14 Mar 2019], the spokesperson said.

While this is the state's 2nd outbreak in 6 months, New Jersey isn't alone: measles cases are continuing to climb around the country, with 465 cases nationwide so far this year [2019], according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Around 80% of those who have contracted the disease across the country are under the age of 19. That total includes 78 new cases in just a week.

Nationally, 2019 has already seen the highest number of cases since 2014, when 667 were confirmed. That makes it the 2nd highest year since 1994, which saw 963 cases.

New York City and Rockland County, New York, have seen outbreaks recently as well. Around 2-3rds of the new cases reported last week came from New York City.

In Ocean County, [the locations and dates listed at the URL above are flagged] by officials for possible measles exposure.

[4] USA (New York, Brooklyn): declaration of public health emergency
Date: Tue 9 Apr 2019, 7:56 PM
Source: Washington Post [abridged, edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/04/09/new-york-orders-measles-vaccinations-brooklyn-amid-outbreak-mayor-says/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.398851752c3a


New York City declared on [Tue 9 Apr 2019] a public health emergency and ordered mandatory measles vaccinations amid an outbreak in Brooklyn, becoming the latest national flash point over refusals to inoculate against dangerous diseases.

Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also announced on [Tue 9 Apr 2019] that they were setting up a special team to oversee and manage the agency's response to ongoing measles outbreaks. The agency said it "continues to be seriously concerned about the accelerating numbers of measles cases being confirmed nationally."

Outbreaks nationwide have forced state and city health officials to pursue tougher stances, such as mandatory vaccines or banning unvaccinated children from public places, prompting legal challenges and judicial intervention.

New York's mandate comes as health officials have scrambled to blunt the spread of measles. At least 285 people have contracted the disease in the city since September [2018], mostly in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood.

"This is the epicenter of a measles outbreak that is very, very troubling and must be dealt with immediately," Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said on [Tue 9 Apr 2019]. "The measles vaccine works. It is safe, it is effective, it is time-tested ... The faster everyone heeds the order, the faster we can lift it."

The mandate orders all unvaccinated people in 4 Zip codes, including a concentration of Orthodox Jews, to receive inoculations, including for children as young as 6 months old. Anyone who resists could be fined up to USD 1000.

"We cannot allow this dangerous disease to make a comeback here in New York City," de Blasio added. "We have to stop it now."

Some Orthodox Jews have resisted vaccines. City health officials said on [Mon 8 Apr 2019] that yeshivas in Williamsburg that do not comply will face fines and possible closure.

As The Washington Post's Frances Stead Sellers reported, government pushes for inoculations and public space bans of unvaccinated children have prompted a backlash among anti-vaccination activists, whose misinformation campaigns have led to declines for vaccinations against one of the world's most contagious diseases.

In New York City late last year [2018], the health department ordered yeshivas and child-care centers in the Orthodox Jewish community to keep out unvaccinated students. One school that violated the mandate has been linked to more than 40 cases, the health department said. "We're making clear that unvaccinated students will not be allowed in schools or day cares," de Blasio said.

Insured adults and children will be covered. Those who are uninsured will pay what they can afford, de Blasio said, and those who cannot afford the vaccination will receive it free.

The vast majority of American Jews are vaccinated, but small groups of Jews with stricter beliefs have chosen to put confidence in their faith rather than health officials. Others mistrust the government. "Most rabbis encourage vaccination based on the Torah commandment to protect one's life," Rabbi Yuval Cherlow, founder and head of the ethics department of the Tzohar Rabbinical Organization in Israel, told The Post on [3 Apr 2019]. "In Judaism, the majority has the right to dictate what takes place in the public space to ward off danger." Still, he said, "there is no pope in Judaism, and no one can force you to vaccinate."

The outbreak in the area has been tied to a child who had not received the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and contracted the disease during a trip to Israel. "Since then, there have been additional people from Brooklyn and Queens who were unvaccinated and acquired measles while in Israel," according to the city's health department.

New York has contended with measles outbreaks and the legal challenges that have arisen in efforts to contain them. An outbreak in Rockland County outside New York City led officials to ban unvaccinated children from public places in mid-March [2019]. A state judge overturned that decision 10 days later.

In Kentucky, a high school student sued state health officials after he was barred from playing basketball because he wasn't vaccinated for chickenpox. He claimed the vaccine was against his religious beliefs. In early April [2019], a judge ruled against his request to rejoin activities at his school.

[The report has been included in full in this post because of its importance. Extreme measures such declaration of a public health emergency and mandatory measles vaccinations appear to be a necessary response by the health department and will work towards protecting public health. It is legal and ethical action to take. In Rockland before the ban of unvaccinated individuals in public spaces was lifted, the vaccination rate had increased significantly, demonstrating declaration of a ban was working. It is very interesting and encouraging that unvaccinated teens are "fact-checking their parents -- and trying to get shots on their own." One has to hope that parents learn from the younger generation. - Mod.LK]

[5] USA (New York): students without vaccinations barred from school
Date: Mon 8 Apr 2019
Source: NY Post [abridged, edited]
https://nypost.com/2019/04/08/city-orders-yeshivas-to-bar-students-without-measles-vaccinations/


"This outbreak is being fueled by a small group of anti-vaxxers in these neighborhoods, said Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot. "They have been spreading dangerous misinformation based on fake science."

The department says that 246 of the 285 cases are children and 39 are adults; 21 people have been hospitalized - including 5 admitted to intensive care units -- but there have been no deaths.

Last month [March 2019], the Health Department put the total at 158 cases.

Officials attributed much of the recent surge to Yeshiva Kehilath Yakov in Williamsburg allowing unvaccinated kids back into school or daycare. They said the yeshiva is connected to more than 40 cases, nearly double the 21 cases reported there a month ago.

However, the Health Department says the school is now in compliance with the exclusion order.

The new order is more expansive than the one issued in December [2018] affecting only schools in selected zip codes in Williamsburg and Borough Park.

[6] USA (New York): city cracks down
Date: Mon 8 Apr 2019
Source: NYPost.com [edited]
https://nypost.com/2019/04/08/de-blasio-calls-measles-clear-and-present-danger-as-city-cracks-down/


Mayor Bill de Blasio backed the Health Department's ban on unvaccinated children attending schools in heavily Orthodox neighborhoods as the city battles its worst measles outbreak in years.

"What we're seeing is very clear, children cannot -- must not -- go to school if they are not vaccinated," de Blasio said during an appearance on NY1 on [Mon 8 Apr 2019] in which he was asked about a city order to bar students at yeshivas from going to class if they have no vaccination. "The school will be held responsible if an unvaccinated child is there."

"There can be fines levied and -- to be very blunt -- if the school does not address this situation in short order, there's even an option for the Health Commissioner to have the school close down," he added. "We can't take the risk, this can be a fatal disease."

De Blasio's remarks were the 1st on the subject since the Health Department issued an order earlier on [Mon 8 Apr 2019] that threatened private yeshivas with fines and closure if they allow unvaccinated students to attend. Officials in December [2018] ordered yeshivas not to allow unvaccinated students to attend and reported that 5 of the religious schools in Brooklyn failed to comply with the order in March [2019].

The latest crackdown comes as the number of measles cases continues to soar in Orthodox neighborhoods in Brooklyn, due to lower vaccination rates and widespread fear of vaccines in the community -- which have been fueled by conspiracy theories. There have been 285 cases of measles reported in Brooklyn and Queens since October [2018], the latest stats from the Health Department show.

The sometimes-fatal disease is especially dangerous for young children and can cause long-term brain damage in still-developing minds. "We have a clear and present danger," de Blasio said. "This is serious, serious stuff."

Washtenaw County is reporting its 1st confirmed case of the measles as the number of infected in Michigan continues to rise. Issuing an update on the outbreak on [Mon 8 Apr 2019], the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) said it has confirmed 2 additional measles cases, bringing the state total to 41 for this year [2019].

The newly confirmed cases are in Oakland and Washtenaw counties, with 39 of those cases in Oakland County, one in Washtenaw County and one in Wayne County. Infected individuals range in age from 8 months to 63 years-old.

MDHHS is working closely with the Oakland County Health Division and Washtenaw County Health Department to identify possible exposure locations for these latest cases. There are dozens of stores, schools and other public buildings already identified as exposure locations, which means anyone who recently visited the locations could have been infected. A complete list of known exposure sites and corresponding dates in Oakland County is listed at <Oakgov.com/health>.

Exposure locations are not yet available for the Washtenaw County case, officials said, and will be provided once available at <washtenaw.org/health>. There are no public exposure sites for the Wayne County case.

A Montreal hospital is warning its patients about possible measles exposure, after an employee worked there while contagious with the disease. McGill University Health Centre [MUHC] says the possible exposure could have occurred at its Glen adult site between [23 and 27 Mar 2019].

MUHC infectious diseases specialist Dr. Marie-Astrid Lefebvre said in a news release that the employee in question "had limited contact with patients and staff" but the hospital isn't taking any chances. "For the moment, there is no evidence that the disease has been transmitted to other people, but we will continue to monitor the situation closely until the end of the incubation period," Lefebvre added.

Measles was considered eradicated in Canada but has re-emerged. The Public Health Agency of Canada says there were 28 cases confirmed in Canada this year [2019], as of [23 Mar 2019]. Those cases occurred in Quebec, British Columbia, Northwest Territories and Alberta. Possible cases have also been reported in Ontario.

Measles cases in Macau reached a total of 31 this year [2019], following the latest confirmation by the Health Bureau (SS) about the contamination of a 55-year old blue-card holder.

The new patient is a woman from Mainland China whose vaccination record was unknown.

The patient manifested fever on 1 Apr 2019 and visited private clinics several times. She then received medical treatment at the emergency section of the Kiang Wu Hospital in Taipa on 5 Apr 2019. She was confirmed to have measles on 6 Apr 2019.

The SS stated that the patient had been in Zhuhai 3 times a week during the incubation period.

The health authority claimed that none of her relatives have yet manifested symptoms of the infection and that it is monitoring the health status of other people who had been in contact with the patient during the initial phase of the disease.

Among the total of 31 measles cases registered since the beginning of the year [2019], 8 cases are health professionals from Kiang Wu Hospital, in the Macau Peninsula, and 2 are health professionals of the Public Hospital Conde de Sao Januario (CHCSJ).

A total of 27 people reportedly recovered and were discharged from hospital facilities.

http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2019/04/119_266819.html


Measles is spreading, with at least 33 confirmed cases of the infectious disease, according to the health authorities.

The infections took place at 2 hospitals, one in Anyang, Gyeonggi Province, and the other in Daejeon, and health officials are trying to stop the disease from spreading into local communities.

25 cases have been confirmed at Hallym University Medical Center in Anyang. 22 of these are doctors, nurses and medical students at the hospital, while 3 are patients.

14 have been placed under mandatory home quarantine as a precaution to stop the virus spreading, and one has been hospitalized. The remaining 10 have been released from quarantine, according to the provincial government.

The local government is keeping close tabs on 4349 people who came into contact with the 25 patients. Officials also checked all 2000 workers at the hospital and found 179 did not have measles antibodies. These workers were vaccinated and have been excluded from work for the time being.

In Daejeon, a 7-month-old girl caught measles, which spread to 7 more children.

The infant was admitted to hospital at the end of last month [March 2019] with cold-like symptoms after being taken to Viet Nam, where measles is also spreading. Doctors suspect she contracted the disease there.

Four more babies aged from 9 months to 3 years old, who shared the hospital ward with the girl, caught measles. They have been isolated at home or in hospital.

Daejeon health authorities have been monitoring more than 170 people who had contact with the babies, including other patients, caregivers and medical staff.

It was believed that measles had been eradicated in Korea thanks to vaccinations, but there have been a growing number of cases recently, mostly involving people infected while overseas.

https://www.sbs.com.au/news/queensland-and-nsw-on-measles-alert-after-tourists-bring-virus-home


Two unvaccinated Australian tourists have sparked a measles alert in the region with the worst immunisation rates in the country.

NSW Health is warning visitors to Gold Coast airport and several NSW north coast towns to remain alert for measles symptoms after the pair of returned travellers caught the disease in Asia.

At 90.6 per cent, NSW North Coast has the worst rate of fully vaccinated 5-year-olds of any primary health network in Australia, according to national data.

Gold Coast doesn't fare much better at 92.2 per cent, 2.5 per cent lower than the national average. Vaccination rates in NSW are at their highest level ever, with more than 95 per cent of 5-year-olds fully vaccinated against measles.

Since Christmas, NSW has recorded 33 measles cases, a rate almost 5 times higher than over the 2 years before that.

The 2 travellers, aged in their 20s, likely acquired the infection while in the Philippines in mid-March 2019 and were unwell before landing on the Gold Coast on 30 Mar 2019, NSW Health said.

Australia is on track for its worst measles rate in 5 years, with 84 confirmed cases so far in 2019, compared to 103 for the whole of 2018 and 81 in 2017.

In NSW, there have been 27 cases so far in 2019, with NSW Health issuing 18 alerts this year [2019], issuing warnings to people who have frequented public places who may have come into contact with those infected.

The majority of the alerts were for Sydney suburbs [with some city locations also].

Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District (ISLHD) public health director Curtis Gregory said while there had been no confirmed cases in the region this year [2019] -- and only one last year -- it was important for residents to be vigilant.

"In 2014, Australia had eradicated measles; there was no internal transmission," he said. "So all these cases are linked to people who have travelled overseas and brought the disease back from countries which don't have strong vaccination programs, like the Philippines where coverage rates have dropped right off."

The latest NSW Health alert was issued on Sun 7 Apr 2019, after 2 young adults were infected while visiting the Philippines. The 2 siblings, who were unvaccinated, spent time in a number of northern NSW locations while still infectious.

"There's a lot of domestic travel in Australia with many people visiting the Illawarra and South Coast to enjoy their natural attractions," Mr Gregory said. "We also have many residents who commute to Sydney."

In the ISLHD vaccination rates are high; in five years or older, the coverage rate is 96.6 per cent, while at 12 months, the rate is 95.6 per cent.

However, those born between 1966 and 1994 were at greater risk of being under-vaccinated, Mr Gregory said, due to changes to the immunisation schedule.

"Prior to 1966, most people were exposed to measles as it was so prevalent back then," he said.

"From 1966 to 1994, people may only have been given one dose, and after that, the 2-dose program was introduced.

The Democratic Republic of Congo is facing a measles outbreak. Since the beginning of the year [2019], this infectious disease has already killed 761 people, according to the World Health Organization.

Between January and March 2019, nearly 42 000 people were infected with measles in the DRC, says WHO. The virus is prevalent in 24 of the 26 provinces in the country. New cases continue to increase, according to the UN agency in charge of health.

Since 2010, the DRC has been dealing with measles epidemics. Last year [2018] for example, the disease caused the deaths of 900 people.

To stem the current infection, WHO and UNICEF will launch a massive vaccination campaign across the country in mid-April 2019.

[The number of measles infections (nearly 42 000 infections and 761 deaths) in 3 months reported in the DRC is devastating to families.

Ebola is an awful disease, yet no one is talking about measles in the DRC, an annually occurring and vaccine-preventable disease.

A measles outbreak in London has reached more than 300 people in the past 6 months. Infections have mostly been within the strictly Orthodox Jewish Charedi community, where inoculation rates have generally been low.

Hackney and Haringey experienced approximately 322 cases from the beginning of October 2018 to 21 Mar 2019. Hackney Clinical Commissioning Group is running immunisation clinics. Harringey Council says it will continue to work with partners to encourage MMR vaccination. Hackney and Haringey have seen 322 cases since the beginning of October 2018, according to Public Health England.

In early December 2019, around 60 people had contracted the disease, but since then the number has risen significantly. The cases have mainly occurred among the area's strictly Orthodox Jewish Charedi community, where vaccination rates have historically been low.

Between 2006-2013, the community experienced measles at a rate of 117 per 100 000. The latest outbreak is affecting people at 10 times that rate, and the data suggest it has now reached between 1 and 2 per cent of the approximately 20 000 strong community.

Hackney Clinical Commissioning Group is running immunisation clinics in an attempt to address the issue, with particular focus on education within Charedi communities.

The MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination is usually delivered in 2 doses, and Haringey and Hackney as a whole have relatively low rates for completing the process. In 2018, they were at 70.2 per cent and 69.7 per cent.

Those numbers are well below the national average, which is 87.2%. The WHO recommends 95% coverage to ensure herd immunity, the form of indirect protection from infectious disease created when enough of the population is immune.

Israel has seen an outbreak of measles in the past year, recording 3600 cases since March 2018. Travel between the country and northeast London is common and believed to have sparked the recent explosion in cases.

Similar circumstances contributed to the measles epidemic in Rockland County, which resulted in the banning of unvaccinated children in public spaces after a state of emergency was announced. The New York Times reported that there had been 153 confirmed cases of measles there since October 2018, primarily among the ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in the county.
