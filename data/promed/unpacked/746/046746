[Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a List A pox disease of cattle characterised
by fever; nodules on the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs;
emaciation; enlarged lymph nodes; edema of the skin; and sometimes death.
LSD is caused by strains of capripoxvirus that are antigenically
indistinguishable from strains causing sheep pox and goat pox, though LSD
has a different geographical distribution to sheep and goat pox, suggesting
that cattle strains of capripoxvirus do not infect and transmit between
sheep and goats. Transmission of LSD virus is thought to be predominantly
by insects, natural contact transmission in the absence of insect vectors
being inefficient. Until 1988 LSD was confined to sub-Saharan Africa, but
then spread into Egypt. There has been only one laboratory-confirmed
outbreak of LSD outside Africa, in Israel in 1989, which was eliminated by
slaughter of all infected and in-contact cattle, and vaccination. Outbreaks
reported in Bahrain and Reunion in 1993 were not confirmed by virus isolation.
Table-form data on the incidence of LSD since 1996 is available on OIE
web-site (Handistatus); all affected countries are located in South Saharan
Africa <http://www.oie.int/hs2/sit_mald_freq_pl.asp?c_cont=1&c_mald=8>
