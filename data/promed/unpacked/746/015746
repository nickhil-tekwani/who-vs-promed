The 2-year old female elephant, Ko Raya, died on Friday [27 May
2011], after suffering from a type of elephant herpes. It is the same
disease that killed her sister Shaina Pali just 8 weeks ago.

Ko Raya had been under the weather for the past few days and on
Friday morning she fell over during a mud bath and died.

"Her mother wanted to get her to stand up," an eyewitness told
mass-circulation paper Bild. "Ko Raya didn't have any more strength.
Suddenly all the elephants started trumpeting together. I think they
wanted to call for help."

Veterinarian Dr Andreas Ochs explained that although the zookeepers
rushed to the elephant, it was too late. "She was already dead."

The herpes virus can be fatal to Asian elephants and it has already
killed 2 other animals at the zoo over the past few years. "The virus
spreads through the blood," Ochs explained to Bild. "It attacks the
internal organs, damaging the liver, intestines, and heart muscles."

Zoo director Bernhard Blaskiewitz says the staff feel helpless in the
face of the deadly disease which has left the zoo with just 6
elephants. "There is simply nothing we can do."
