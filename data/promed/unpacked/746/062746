Previous emergency warnings have been made regarding the potential for
outbreaks of illnesses caused by hantaviruses, Chinese Government agencies
in the heavily flood-damaged northeastern Heilongjiang province. Flooding
of the Yangtze as well as the Songhua and Nenjiang rivers in the northeast
this summer has killed at least 3,000 people and left an estimated 10
million to 14 million homeless.
Health Ministry officials have warned that the entire northeast faces
increasing danger from a possible major outbreak of epidemics, given that
500,000 people have been left homeless by the floods and are still sleeping
in makeshift accommodations in Heilongjiang alone. Crowded, unsanitary
conditions in refugee camps as well as the spread of human sewage by
floodwaters have put health authorities on top alert, with outbreaks of
typhoid and cholera already reported.
President Jiang Zemin continued an inspection tour of flood-hit areas along
the Yangtze River, state television reported.
"We have scored a decisive victory in the anti-flood struggle. Now we have
to make all efforts to rebuild new homes," he told an audience of troops
and flood evacuees.
