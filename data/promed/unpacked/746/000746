Destruction caused by [pink] snow mold in some eastern Washington wheat has surprised Tim Murray, WSU. Melting snow is exposing injured wheat in parts of the state where destruction by snow mold is rarely seen. Damage [is] ranging from lesions on leaves to underground crown decay that kills the crop.

Abnormally warm temperatures in November [2016] kept the ground from freezing before snow arrived, creating a more hospitable environment for _Microdochium nivale_. That, coupled with a longer-than-usual period of snow cover, gave it just what it needed to thrive. _Microdochium nivale_ is one of 3 snow molds in Washington.

Murray is advising growers to let a few weeks of warmer weather pass in order to assess the full damage and decide whether reseeding will be necessary.

[Pink snow mould of wheat and other small grain cereals is caused by _Microdochium nivale_ (previously _Monographella nivalis_ var. _nivalis_) which produces masses of microscopic spores on pink growth. It attacks plants during wet, cool weather but is not dependent on snow. It can also cause seedling and head blights, as well as contribute in co-infection with other pathogens to a number of "fusarium" disease complexes such as seedling blights, head blights and foot rots (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

Several other fungal species can show up as snow moulds of cereals, such as _Typhula_ species causing speckled (due to sclerotia) snow mould. Some of these fungi are restricted to areas with prolonged deep snow cover.

Snow moulds survive in debris of affected plants or as sclerotia in soil. They generally affect a number of cereal and grass hosts. The pathogens are most aggressive at low temperatures. Symptoms are most apparent in early spring when the snow first melts. Plant vigour may be markedly reduced, and in severe cases, the crowns are killed (as mentioned above). Surviving plants recover slowly and are sensitive to additional stresses. Disease management may include cultural practices, fungicide applications and the use of suitable host cultivars with increased levels of resistance or tolerance to the pathogens.
