Recent ProMED-mail reports on HFRS outbreaks in Tatarstan and Yaroslav
prompted us to the attached reply, in which we try to summarize the present
knowledge on hantaviruses and their rodent carriers in western Russia. We
hope you will find it valuable.

On several occasions when hantavirus cases/outbreaks in Europe, especially
in Russia, have been reported on ProMED-mail, there has been a confusion
regarding the potential infectious agents. Hantaan virus (HTNV), originally
isolated in the striped field mouse (_Apodemus agrarius_) in Korea, has
repeatedly been suggested as one of the likely causes of the epidemics.
Some of us have earlier commented on these messages from Russia, suggesting
that Puumala virus (PUUV), and not HTNV, is the most likely agent for the
recent epidemics. This is based on the corresponding extraordinary high
densities of the bank vole (_Clethrionomys glareolus_), the natural
reservoir of PUUV, in these regions during the epidemics (e.g. in Samara
and in Bashkortostan in 1997). However, we would like, once again, to
clarify what is known for hantaviruses in (eastern) Europe.
1) The circulation of HTNV virus has never been convincingly proven in this
part of Russia or elsewhere in Europe. Previously reported isolates of HTNV
from Russia have in all investigated cases been found to be laboratory
contaminations (by prototype strains). Actually, there are no proven cases
of HTNV or Seoul (SEOV) infections either from Europe or from western
Russia (west of the Urals). This is not to say that SEOV will not be found
in Europe in the future, but so far all claimed cases have turned out to be
Dobrava hantavirus (DOBV).
2) On the other hand, during the recent years of hantavirus research the
circulation of DOBV, has been proven in large parts of central and eastern
Europe. HFRS cases caused by DOBV have at present been proven, in addition
to from former Yugoslavia, from Albania, Greece, Germany, Estonia and
Russia. Interestingly, in contrast to the Balkan region where DOBV seems to
be carried mainly by _Apodemus flavicollis_, in Estonia and Russia the
virus has only been found in _Apodemus agrarius_.
3) Notably, two outbreaks in the Ryazan and Tula regions in Russia,
previously reported as caused by SEOV virus, were later proven to be solely
caused by DOBV.
Thus, the two hantaviruses known to circulate and to cause HFRS in western
Russia are PUUV and DOBV. All available data from the last epidemics, based
on rodent epidemiology and clinical observations, indicate that PUUV is the
most common cause of the recent HFRS epidemics.
Simultaneous HFRS epidemics in Bashkortostan (Bashkiria), Samara, and
Tatarstan (all have been discussed earlier on ProMED-mail) are probably
related. In European temperate deciduous forests, mast years (heavy seed
crops of oak, beech etc) affect in a pronounced way the dynamics of forest
rodents like the bank vole, the wood mouse (_Apodemus sylvaticus_) and the
yellow necked field mouse (_A. flavicollis_). In addition to the basic
multiannual rhythm in bud development, flowering and masting, warmer than
normal summers can induce the bud development, and therefore the mast years
can be synchronous over large areas. A similar connection between masting
and rodent dynamics is also known for eastern USA, where it has been
associated to the prevalence of Lyme disease. Even though garbage dumping
etc. was mentioned as likely causes of the epidemics in the original
ProMED-mail reports, multiannual variation in the masting could instead be
the primary reason for the regular HFRS epidemics in these regions. The
increasing trend in the number of human cases could be, as Prof. Tkachenko
has suggested, due to the construction boom during the last decade; i.e. a
lot of new private houses and cabins have been built in the forests, which
in turn has resulted in increased contacts with rodents. In 1997, HFRS
epidemics occurred in Bashkortostan and in Samara, and were most likely
caused by the high numbers of bank voles carrying PUUV. For Bashkortostan
and Yaroslav this winter, PUUV has already been reported as the likely
agent, and it is probably the same agent in Samara and Tatarstan.
However, only specific serology or direct RT-PCR on patient material will
solve these interesting questions. We are willing to analyze samples from
these cases without any charge. Most efficient will be a) acute-phase
serum/blood samples for confirmation of an acute hantavirus infection (by
detection of hantavirus-specific IgM), combined with b) convalescent
samples, drawn at least 1 month after onset of symptoms, for hantavirus
serotyping (by neutralization test). Please contact A. Lundkvist for details.

[Thanks to Ake and his collborators for taking time from their busy
schedules to provide us with this marvelous overview and expert summary. It
seems to me that there has not been "confusion regarding the potential
infectious agents". Until we have definitive information as to the specific
hantavirus that is the etiologic agent, we simply say "a hantavirus", which
is correct, but we always ask for additional information from a local
source; it usually is not forthcoming. I make regular field trips
(hantavirus studies) and, by chance, reports on outbreaks of disease caused
by hantaviruses seem to arrive at ProMED-mail when I am away. When this
occurs, someone else does the moderating. We are now holding all such
reports until I return home. - Mod. CHC
