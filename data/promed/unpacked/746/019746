Officials with the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) report another fatality due to primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) from infection with the brain-eating amoeba, _Naegleria fowleri_. The 20-year-old, Malir man is the thirteenth death due to this parasite in Karachi to date this year [2019].

According to the Pakistani news source, The News, Director General Health Sindh Dr. Masood Solangi said their teams of experts had started investigating the case and visited the residence of the deceased to interview his family, who informed that he had gone to a local pool for swimming. He said the swimming pool without having any chlorination could have been a place where he contracted the deadly brain infection.

According to the CDC, _Naegleria fowleri_ is a free-living microscopic ameba, (single-celled living organism). It can cause a rare and devastating infection of the brain called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM).

The ameba is commonly found in warm freshwater (e.g. lakes, rivers, and hot springs) and soil. _Naegleria fowleri usually_ infects people when contaminated water enters the body through the nose. Once the ameba enters the nose, it travels to the brain where it causes PAM, which is usually fatal. Infection typically occurs when people go swimming or diving in warm freshwater places, like lakes and rivers.

In very rare instances, _Naegleria_ infections may also occur when contaminated water from other sources (such as inadequately chlorinated swimming pool water or heated and contaminated tap water) enters the nose. You cannot get infected from swallowing water contaminated with _Naegleria_.

[According to the above report there have been 13 fatal cases of PAM in 2019. The sub-optimal chlorination of the water sources has been highlighted as a contributing factor which coupled with hot, humid climate in Sindh provides an environment for proliferation of _Naegleria fowleri_ amoebae.

Amebic meningoencephalitis is an extremely rare and sporadic central nervous system (CNS) infection caused by free-living amoebae, mostly found in freshwater lakes and rivers. The initial symptoms of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) are indistinguishable from bacterial meningitis, while the symptoms of granulomatous amebic meningoencephalitis (GAE) can mimic a brain abscess or meningitis. Diagnosis can be made by observing motile amoebae in a wet mount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or visualization on CSF Wright or Giemsa stain. Treatment consists of a combination of systemic and intrathecal antibiotics. - Mod.UBA
