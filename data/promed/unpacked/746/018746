According to these stories, investigators from the Federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention who are looking into an outbreak of food
poisoning that has sickened 40 people and killed four in 10 states since
August have warned consumers on the storing and cooking of hot dogs and
cold cuts.
The stories say that _Listeria monocytogenes_ is carried in the intestines
of animals and can easily come into contact with raw vegetables, dairy
products or uncooked meat. It thrives in refrigerators, but can be
destroyed by boiling or reheating food to 165 degrees Fahrenheit.
When ingested, _Listeria bacteria_ can cause illness and death among the
elderly, pregnant women, newborns and those with weakened immune systems.
In a normal year, an estimated 1,850 people become seriously ill. Of these,
425 die.
Three who have died in this outbreak have been elderly. They are a man, 79,
from the Rochester, N.Y., area, and two others from Ohio, one from Toledo
and one from Cincinnati. The fourth victim, from the Toledo area, was a
fetus.
Ohio has had the largest number of cases, 13. New York has had 12.
Tennessee, Massachusetts and West Virginia have each had 3. Michigan has
had two cases. Connecticut, Oregon, Vermont and Georgia have had one each.
The outbreak began on Aug. 2.
Dr. Elizabeth Koch, acting state epidemiologist in Ohio, was cited as
saying the DNA of the bacteria involved in the outbreak showed "a very rare
pattern," called Pattern E.
Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the disease agency, was cited as saying that
on Dec. 19, three days before the Bil Mar recall, investigators isolated
this strain of _Listeria_ on an open package of hot dogs that a month
earlier had been eaten by one of those who became ill. It is not known how
or where this package was contaminated.
