Death toll from yellow fever in Sudan's Darfur region jumps to 150
------------------------------------------------------------------
The death toll from yellow fever jumped to 150 in Sudan's Darfur region and the number of infection cases to 400, Khartoum's Al-Ray Al Am daily reported Sunday [18 Nov 2012].

"The death cases from yellow fever in Darfur region reached 150 in addition to the infection of 400 people," the report said.

The paper further disclosed that great quantities of yellow fever vaccines have arrived in the country and have been received by Sudanese Ministry of Health, while the remaining quantity is expected to arrive in the coming days to reach 4.2 million doses at a cost of more than 7 million US dollars.

The vaccines would be transported to the region to commence a vaccination campaign by the end of this week [week ending 25 Nov 2012].

According to the paper, the disease outbreak has sparked panic among the citizens of the region.

The World Health Organization (WHO) last week announced that the total
number of cases had reached 374, including 110 deaths, with case fatality rate of 29.4 percent.

It said 7 quarantine centers have been established in Nyala, Kass, Nertity, Zalengei, Garcilla, Morni, and Geneina in response to the disease outbreak in the region.

Yellow fever is mainly spread by mosquitoes, and its most frequent symptoms are fever, bleeding, and vomiting. There is no effective treatment for the disease, other than alleviate dehydration and fever and blood transfusion.

[Yellow fever deaths in Darfur have increased by 40 since the most recent ProMED-EAFR update of 16 Nov 2012 (archive no. 20121117.287980). Good enough, yellow fever vaccines are already in the country to allow reactive yellow fever vaccination to protect at-risk populations and hence prevent new cases/deaths.

[ProMED-mail Correspondent SB found a snippet in the Khartoum newspaper Alnilin [in Arabic] which said that Professor Mamoun had revealed the emergence of yellow fever [YF] cases in Khartoum and that the Khartoum Minister for Health had revealed the 'emergence' of 2 cases. The URL for this snippet is not longer available on the internet. The arrival of YF vaccine is good news indeed. However the delay until the end of the week to begin the vaccination campaign in Darfur, and the 11 days post-vaccination period for reliable immunity to occur, indicate that additional YF cases and deaths can be expected. The occurrence of 2 YF cases in Khartoum is a serious concern. It was not stated if these cases were imported from Darfur or were locally acquirted. In either case, is these individuals were viremia while in Khatrom, there is a risk of ongoing transmission there. This would complicate the YF situation in Sudan considerably. ProMED would appreciate receiving addition information as it becomes available. - Mod.TY]

Sudan's Minister of Health Bahar Idriss Abu Garda announced the arrival of anti-yellow fever vaccines to Darfur States where the disease had struck. Anti-yellow fever vaccination campaign will kick off on Tuesday [20 Nov 2012], said Abu Garda who stopped over El Fasher en route to west Darfur, the hard-hit area.

West Darfur Minister of Health Ahmed Ishaq Yagoub told Sudan Vision yesterday that fatalities as a result of the disease reached 43 and122 cases contracted the disease.

By the kickoff of the vaccination campaign, the Health Ministry has made great strikes in its endeavour to combat the disease in the region, he said. Abu Garda added that the Health Ministry made great efforts to control the spread of the disease and the international community has positively responded to the campaign against yellow fever. He praised efforts made by the North Darfur State to prevent the outbreak of the disease. Comparatively, the health situation in North Darfur is better, he said.

Abu Al Abbas Abdullah, Minister of Health of North Darfur State said 5 cases suspected to be yellow fever were reported in the State and that samples were taken for lab test. He underlined the precautionary measures taken by the State to that end, affirming the readiness of the ministry to continue awareness and vaccination campaigns.

Health authorities in Darfur States have affirmed the stability of the health situation after the campaigns of spraying to control spread of yellow fever.

Central Darfur State Health Minister Eissa Mohamed Musa said causes of the disease are declining after measures were taken to control the outbreak. He said cases of the disease shot up to 303 among them 73 fatalities over the past days. He added that vaccines are being transported to the region, adding that many patients have recovered from the disease in their quarantines. He said a campaign will start today in all Darfur States to control the disease.

Abu Baker Hussein, governor of East Darfur State confirmed the stability of the security situation in the state, adding that there were no fatalities as a result of the disease in his state.

The minister added that many health staff has been trained and several health clinics opened as part of efforts to control the disease.

Hamad Ismail Hamad, governor of South Darfur, said health situation in the area is stable and the cases are now decreasing and the disease is under control. He said vaccines have reached the area to control the disease. He said campaign for vaccination against yellow fever and polio will start on Tuesday.

Dr. Ahmed Ishaq, Minister of Health of West Darfur State said cases of yellow fever reached 122 until yesterday among them 43 fatalities. He said 35 mobile spraying pumps were delivered to the State to combat mosquitoes that transmit the disease. He said the federal ministry of health received quantities of vaccines to control spread of yellow fever.

[The figures given in this report are significantly lower than the numbers of fatalities and total cases cited in the 1st report [1] above. Given the sharp increase in the number of reported cases in the past 2-3 days, it is difficult to understand that the outbreak is under control and decreasing as the health officials indicated. Spraying is, at best, a temporary measure to reduce vector mosquito populations. Although adult mosquitoes may be killed, if the breeding sites remain, a new crop of adults will emerge quickly and YF virus transmission will continue. If the vaccination campaign can start on Tuesday, rather than at the end of the week as indicated in [1] above, that will be very helpful in reducing the number of cases. - Mod.TY]
