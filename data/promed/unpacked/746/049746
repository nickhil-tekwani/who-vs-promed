FDA PANEL SAYS GELATIN IS FREE OF MAD COW RISK
A panel of scientists was cited as telling the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration today that gelatin made from cattle bones and hides in
countries with mad cow disease is safe if certain precautions are taken.
The FDA usually follows the recommendations of its advisory panels.
Committee chairman Paul Brown of the National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke said the advisers want to review gelatin safety again
in a year, when more industry studies are completed.
The FDA restriction has caused a supply shortage because U.S. manufacturers
rely heavily on Europe for raw material, and spinal columns are not
routinely removed in those countries, said William Stringer of the
Coalition of Gelatin Capsule Manufacturers.
Stringer said the panel's decision would help ease the shortage, but added
that "there is no evidence that gelatin or gelatin products serve as a
vector for BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease)."
Field tests by the British government found no evidence of BSE in skins or
hides, although there was some hint that it might be in the bone marrow of
animals more than 30 months old, said Raymond Bradley of the U.K.
agriculture ministry.
Earlier on Thursday, the panel separately recommended that the FDA continue
to bar imports of tallow from countries with outbreaks of mad cow disease.
They said there was a small risk that people could be infected by products
made from cows with the disease. [see previous posting for details on this.
