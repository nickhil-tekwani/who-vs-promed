The composition of the vaccine for year 2000 (southern hemisphere influenza
season) has been decided and communicated to vaccine manufacturers by the
World Health Organization (WHO), following agreement on its content by
international experts at a WHO meeting held in Nice, France this week. The
experts recommended that the influenza vaccine for 2000 (Southern
Hemisphere) contain the following three components:
· an A/Moscow/10/99 (H3N2)-like virus
· an A/Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like virus
· a B/Beijing/184/93-like virus* or a B/Shangdong/7/97-like virus
WHO recommends the vaccine composition for the northern hemisphere each
year in February. Since 1998 WHO now also holds a Consultation each
September to formulate a recommendation for the composition of inactivated
influenza vaccines intended for the following southern hemisphere winter
(May to September of the following year). The timing of WHO's
recommendations is critical to allow sufficient time for companies to
produce the vaccine before the new influenza season starts.
WHO strongly recommends the use of vaccine as an effective preventive
measure against this potentially fatal disease. About 50% to 80% of vaccine
recipients will be protected against the disease when there is good match
between the vaccine and strains of influenza virus that are in circulation.
In cases where the vaccine does not fully protect against the disease,
severity of illness and the frequency of serious complications are reduced.
Most of the population has been previously infected with or exposed to
influenza A(H3N2), influenza A(H1N1) and influenza B viruses and is known
to have some degree of residual immunity. As a consequence, one dose of
influenza vaccine should be sufficient for all ages except young children.
Previously-unimmunized children should receive two doses of vaccine with an
interval of at least four weeks.
The specific vaccine viruses used in each country should be approved by the
national control authorities. National public health authorities are
responsible for recommendations regarding the use of vaccines.
All WHO recommendations are published in WHO's Weekly Epidemiological
Record (WER) and communicated to public health authorities, national
control authorities and influenza vaccine manufacturers.
The detection of new influenza viruses is made possible through the WHO
network for influenza surveillance and control composed of 110 National
Influenza Centres in 82 countries and the four WHO Collaborating Centres
for Virus Reference and Research in Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom
and the USA. This network helps WHO monitor influenza activity in all
regions of the world and ensures that virus isolates and information are
sent rapidly to the WHO Collaborating Centres for Virus Reference and
Research for immediate strain identification.
* The most widely used vaccine virus is B/Yamanashi/166/98
