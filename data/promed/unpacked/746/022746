West Nile virus Detected in 3 Dead Flamingos at Zoo Atlanta
-----------------------------------------------------------
Three flamingos that died at Zoo Atlanta in late August and early September
tested positive for West Nile virus, zoo officials confirmed on Wed 28 Nov
2001. The virus was discovered in routine examinations of the dead birds at
the University of Georgia. Zoo Atlanta spokeswoman Xiamara Richards said
that the official cause of death is "natural causes" for the 2 adult
tropical birds and one chick. "We can't say conclusively that they died [as
a result of West Nile virus infection, only that they tested positive.
Little is known about what symptoms flamingos would show once infected, so
it's difficult to diagnose."
A stand of pink flamingos congregates in a small pond near the entrance of
the zoo and are practically unofficial greeters to visitors. The zoo had
been on watch for the potentially fatal virus throughout the summer as part
of a national survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
the American Zoological and Aquarium Association. Once the first cases of
West Nile virus were reported in Georgia in July 2001, zoo-keepers stepped
up efforts to fight mosquitoes, which carry the virus.
This is not the first time flamingos have been found vulnerable to the
virus. Several died in New York City zoos in 1999, when the exotic virus
was first recognized in the U.S. The Georgia Division of Public Health,
which monitors the spread of West Nile virus, maintains a running tally of
West Nile cases. As of 15 Nov 2001, 325 birds, 30 horses and one person
have tested positive for the virus in Georgia this year [As of 5 Dec 2001,
the number of human cases has risen to 5, with one death. - Mod.CP. No
flamingos were listed in the state tally at that point, but Fulton County,
where the zoo is located, has had 20 crows, 36 blue jays, one robin and one
mockingbird test positive.
