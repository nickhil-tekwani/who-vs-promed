Multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ Braenderup infections linked to Rose Acre Farms shell eggs
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Case count update
-----------------
Since the last update on 16 Apr 2018, 12 more ill people were added to this outbreak.

35 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Braenderup have been reported from 9 states. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 16 Nov 2017 to 14 Apr 2018. Ill people range in age from 1 to 90 years, with a median age of 65. 50 percent of ill people are female. Of 28 people with information available, 11 (39 percent) have been hospitalized and no deaths have been reported.

State / Case count
------------------
Colorado / 1
Florida / 2
New Jersey / 1
New York / 8
North Carolina / 5
Pennsylvania / 6
South Carolina / 3
Virginia / 8
West Virginia / 1
------------------
Total / 35

Illnesses that occurred after 23 Mar 2018, might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill with _Salmonella_ and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

WGS [whole genome sequencing] analysis did not identify antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from 22 ill people. Testing of 3 clinical isolates using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory also did not show any resistance.

Investigation update
--------------------
State and local health officials continue to interview ill people to ask about the foods they ate and other exposures they had before they became ill. 22 (88 percent) of 25 people interviewed reported eating shell eggs. 16 (64 percent) reported eating various egg dishes at different restaurants. This percentage is significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy people in which 38 percent of respondents reported eating any eggs away from home in the week before they were interviewed. These restaurants reported using shell eggs in the dishes eaten by ill people.

This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide more information as it becomes available.

[Adequate cooking of the contaminated eggs will prevent illness. More than 200 million eggs were recalled.

_Salmonella enterica_, especially serotype Enteritidis, has the unique ability to contaminate eggs without causing discernible illness in the birds infected. The infection route to humans involves colonization, survival, and multiplication of the pathogen in the hen house environment, the bird, and, finally, the egg. The review cited below highlights the stages of transmission and discusses evidence that altered bacterial growth patterns and specific cell surface characteristics contribute to the adaptation of _S._ enteritidis to these diverse environments.
