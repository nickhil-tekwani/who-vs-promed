Consumption of meat from ill goats has caused the locals of a village of Melgada of Aadarsha rural municipality-1 in the district to fall ill, confirmed doctors involved in their treatment.

Of the total 15 people who have taken ill receiving treatment at Shaileshwori Hospital in Pipalla, 13 have been discharged, and 2 are reported to be in serious condition. The victims had vomited and had diarrhea after they ate goat meat.

"The people were taken ill after they ate goat meat on Sat 4 May 2019. The slaughtered goats must have been suffering from disease. They fell ill after they ate uncooked meat of the ill goats," said Dr Aaijung Kunwar, director of the hospital.

Some months ago, dozens of livestock had been killed due to an outbreak of an unidentified disease. Further investigations into the matter would be launched, said assistant chief district officer Tek Narayan Poudyal.

[The newswire does not state what the incubation period was from ingestion of the meat to the start of symptoms and whether fever was present. The relative mildness of the illnesses (13 of 15 already discharged) makes anthrax unlikely. - Mod.LL
