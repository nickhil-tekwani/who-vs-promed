Veterinary Measures to Reduce the Risk of Human CCHF Infection
--------------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI: The current outbreak of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF),
which has caused several deaths, demands urgent measures to isolate the
entire Kohlo [region and nearby areas in Baluchistan, where the occurrence
of the disease was first reported in October 2000. Physicians have also
called for proper measures to quarantine and disinfect hospital wards all
over the country, where confirmed patients as well as those under
investigation are admitted. This viral disease had erupted during the dry
season (between Sept to Dec) in 1976, 1987 and 1994 in Baluchistan. This
calls for [introduction of measures to combat any future epidemic situation.
CCHF is transmitted by the [bite of a fly [ixodid tick carrying the virus
from infected cattle to human beings. So [the relocation of cattle pens
[away from human settlements to the outskirts of cities is essential [to
limit the risk of human infection. Dr Asad Abro, WHO Operations Officer
for Sindh, also emphasized the need for veterinary personnel to be
extremely vigilant, to identify infected cattle, arrange their isolation
and safe elimination, and to ensure that they are not slaughtered for
public consumption. CCHF virus also spreads through direct human contact.
Therefore all hospitals and dispensaries need to [ensure effective
sterilization procedures. CCHF is a dangerous disease and early treatment
is advised, because mortality is attributable [predominantly to a severe
decline in blood platelets as a result of hemorrhage, and management of the
disease is limited to control of bleeding.
[The present situation is that some 10 deaths are reported to have
occurred in Baluchistan due to CCHF virus infection during the past one
month. A further 2 deaths have been reported in Karachi. However, another 5
cases, all from Baluchistan, who were admitted with high fever to a private
hospital in the city, have [been cleared and discharged after thorough
investigation. One other suspected CCHF patient has been admitted to a
private ward in a city hospital, and is currently under observation.

[A problem for public health officials responsible for preventative
measures in this part of the country is the prevalence of other epidemic
viral diseases (e.g., dengue fever) and lack of facilities for rapid and
accurate diagnosis. - Mod.CP
