More than 5 million people in South and Southeast Asia will die from
viral hepatitis over the next decade, as experts warn of a rampant
epidemic that has already taken more lives than malaria, dengue and
HIV/AIDS combined in the past 10 years.

The crisis is compounded by lack of awareness about the disease and
the increasing resistance to drugs, the World Health Organisation
(WHO) says. More than 130 million people from 11 Asian countries carry
hepatitis B and [and/or?] C, out of a total of 520 million globally.

A statement released by WHO today [22 Jul 2011] said that "seemingly
healthy people may be infected and can continue to spread the
infection," while chronic hepatitis B and C are "among the leading
causes of preventable deaths" in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, East
Timor, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Nepal, North Korea, Sri Lanka and
Thailand.

"These viruses are 30 times more prevalent than HIV in [these
countries]. However, due to the asymptomatic nature of these
infections, about 60 percent of infected individuals remain unaware
that they are infected, until they show symptoms of cirrhosis or a
type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma; this may take
over 20 years."

It added that more than half of the total deaths [attributable] to
hepatitis E [virus infection], which can be contracted by eating or
drinking contaminated food or water, occur in this region.

The majority of these 11 countries [Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, East
Timor, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Nepal, North Korea, Sri Lanka and
Thailand] suffer from regular and acute health crises, with rates of
HIV/AIDS in Thailand among the highest in the world, and Burma and
North Korea subjected to some of the world's lowest government
healthcare spending.

Up-to-date information on hepatitis, however, is scarce. Vismita
Gupta-Smith, from the WHO's regional office in India, said that the
lack of public awareness meant the organisation was struggling to find
accurate data for each country in the region. "We're asking national
governments to give us all their data and advocating that monitoring
[of the spread of hepatitis] should be strengthened," she said. "We
want disease to be on the radar for the general public so that people
can go and test themselves."

To boost awareness, the WHO has set 28 Jul 2011 as the 1st World
Hepatitis Day, Gupta-Smith said.
