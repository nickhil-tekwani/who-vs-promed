Babesiosis Rates Among U.S. Elderly Explored
---------------------------------------------
The prevalence of babesiosis among elderly Medicare beneficiaries in
the
United States increased from 2006 to 2008, with significant
variations
across race, gender, age, and state of diagnosis, according to a
study
published online Dec. 14 in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Mikhail Menis, from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in
Rockville, Md.,
and colleagues assessed annual rates of babesiosis among elderly
Medicare
beneficiaries (aged 65 years and older) in the United States during
2006 to
2008, using Medicare & Medicaid Services administrative databases.
The
estimated rates were stratified by year, age, sex, race, state of
residence,
and month of diagnosis.

The investigators found that 985, 851, and 1,223 babesiosis cases
were
recorded in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively, yielding
corresponding
annual rates of 3.6, 3.2, and 4.7 per 100,000 beneficiaries.

Annual babesiosis rates for those years were significantly higher
among white
elderly (4.0, 3.6, and 5.2, respectively) compared to non-white
elderly
beneficiaries (0.6, 0.9, and 1.4, respectively). Significantly higher
rates
were observed for men than women, and for young elderly women (65 to
84
years) than older elderly women (>=85 years).

July and August saw the highest number of cases, with 74.4 percent of
diagnoses occurring in May through October. The top 10 states and
District of Columbia accounted for 84.7, 83.3, and 83.7 percent of
cases in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. The highest rates were
seen in Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, and Massachusetts.

"Overall, our three-year study suggests that there were more cases of
babesiosis in 2008 compared with previous years," the authors write.

[The original study is found in Emerging Infectious Diseases (Anderson
SA et al. Babesiosis among Elderly Medicare Beneficiaries, United
States, 2006â€“2008. EID 2012,18
http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/1/11-0305_article.htm. The study
used notified cases and does not address the question whether the
diagnosis was correct or not. Babesia infections is often asymptomatic
in immunocompetent people. A study of antibodies against Babesia in
blood donors from the northeastern United States found a 1.1%
seroprevalence was identified in Connecticut and a seroprevalence for
the offshore islands of Massachusetts of 1.4% (Johnson ST et al.
Seroprevalence of Babesia microti in blood donors from Babesia-endemic
areas of the northeastern United States: 2000 through 2007.
Transfusion. 2009;49:2574-82.). Thus Babesia is a common infection and
the majority of the cases are asymptomatic.
