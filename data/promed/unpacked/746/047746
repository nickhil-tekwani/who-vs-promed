Panama disease detection worry
------------------------------
Panama disease, also known as fusarium wilt, has been detected in a
commercial Ladyfinger banana plantation near Mareeba. Mike Ashton,
Biosecurity Queensland, said that although this particular strain has been
found in the region before, it was important that growers put in place
appropriate biosecurity measures to protect their farms.

The race 1 of Panama disease has previously been identified on the Atherton
Tablelands at Mareeba and Tolga, and is endemic throughout most
banana-growing regions of Queensland and northern NSW. It attacks the
Ladyfinger and Ducasse varieties of banana, but not Cavendish.

The Plant Protection Regulation 2002 establishes quarantine areas in
Queensland to prevent the spread of banana pests and diseases, and
prescribes measures to contain Panama disease when it is detected.

"We are taking immediate steps to minimise the effect of this outbreak,
including issuing directions to prevent spread from the affected property,
trace-forward investigations to determine the potential for further spread,
and surveillance of the affected and neighbouring properties to determine
the extent of the outbreak," Mr Ashton said. "It is important our efforts
are supported by growers."

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is
caused by the soilborne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_.
Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem. Affected
plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material,
mechanical means, soil, and water, and can survive in the soil for more
than 30 years. Since no effective chemical or cultural control measures are
known, disease management must rely on exclusion and eradication. Constant
vigilance is required in areas where the pathogen is known to exist to
prevent flare-ups of the disease.

Several races of the pathogen exist. Races 1 and 2 attack several different
cultivars of eating and cooking bananas, but not Cavendish varieties (for
information on banana genotypes please see link below); race 3 attacks
ornamental _Heliconia_ species only; temperate race 4 and the recently
emerged tropical race 4 (TR4) attack cultivars in the Cavendish subgroup as
well as hosts of races 1 and 2. Different PD races have been reported from
Australia, and resistant cultivars suitable for commercial use are being
developed but are not yet available.
