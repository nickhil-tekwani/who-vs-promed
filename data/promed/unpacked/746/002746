Subject: Bat lyssavirus, cat, Italy

On 27 Jun 2020, the national reference center for lyssavirus in Italy isolated a bat lyssavirus, namely the Western Caucasian bat lyssavirus, from the brain of a cat that died after displaying neurological signs and biting its owner (and possibly other people, including the veterinarian who had it in care). As of today [Tue 7 Jul 2020], various sources have stated the owner and 3 other people have undergone PEP, even though it's not clear whether the standard rabies vaccine and antiserum are effective against this particular lyssavirus. Moreover, there's no prior evidence of this strain ever being transmitted to humans. Local authorities have put in place a series of measures aimed at investigating the presence of this virus in the local bat population and controlling the rabies infection.

You can find the 1st communication from the reference center at https://www.izsvenezie.it/caso-lyssavirus-gatto-comune-arezzo/ [see comment] and an article published by the national veterinary association detailing the public health measures that have been put in place at https://www.anmvioggi.it/rubriche/attualita/69780-lyssavirus-le-due-ordinanze-del-sindaco-di-arezzo.html.

[The following information is copied/abridged from the (translated) notification by the Venezia national reference center:

"On Sat 27 June 2020, the National Reference Center for rabies isolated a lyssavirus from a cat brain sample, sent by the Zooprophylactic Institute of Lazio and Tuscany (IZSLT). The sample had been taken following the death of the cat, who had previously bitten the owner residing in the municipality of Arezzo. Prior to this case, this specific lyssavirus had been found only once, worldwide, in a Caucasian bat in 2002, without ever having confirmed its ability to infect pets or humans. Italy is officially free of rabies since 2013.

"Based on the experience gained from similar cases in other countries for similar viruses, the transmission capacity from the natural reservoir to another species represents an extremely limited event, which is not followed by an epidemic spread. Currently, there is no evidence of animal-to-human transmission. As a precaution, people who were in contact with the cat who tested positive for the infection underwent post-exposure prophylaxis."

The West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV) was obtained from the brain of a male common bent-winged bat (_Miniopterus schreibersi_), captured during a field expedition in July 2002 in the Caucasus (about 100 km [62 mi] southeast of the town of Krasnodar). No sick bats or carcasses were found in the visited caves. Inoculated mice became paralyzed and died 9-13 days after intracerebral inoculation (Ref 1). Subsequent experiments (Ref 2) indicated that WCBV was apathogenic for 3-week-old mice by intramuscular and oral routes; but Syrian hamsters challenged intramuscularly with the same virus dose developed typical rabies symptoms and all succumbed (100% mortality).

Further research is needed to assess the distribution and zoonotic implications of this virus.

Education of the public to avoid manipulating bats may prove an effective preventative measure.
