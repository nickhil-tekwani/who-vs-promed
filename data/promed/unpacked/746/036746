The [Crimean] Congo [hemorrhagic fever; CCHF] virus claimed another life in Karachi as a 51-year-old man died on Friday [26 Sep 2014] due to the deadly, tick-borne viral disease. This was the 3rd case reported in the city this year [2014], with 2 of them fatal.

Karachi Health Director Dr Zafar Aijaz told The News that the man, a resident of Liaquatabad, had gone to the sacrificial cattle market on Super Highway a few days back and had developed high fever and other symptoms related to the CCHF virus.

Aijaz said this was the 3rd case of CCHF reported in the city in the current season. According to him, one of the reported patients has recovered, while 2 of them have passed away.

The CCHF virus infects humans when they come into close contact with animals infected with ticks.

[There have been sporadic cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in various parts of Pakistan this year (2014). CCHF virus is a tick-borne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_. The man's exposure may have been via tick bite or exposure to the blood of an infected animal. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs [where infection control procedures are faulty. - Mod.JW]. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.
