Pertussis (whooping cough) cases in San Diego County number nearly 900 for the year [2014], according to the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency; 9 new cases of the disease were confirmed this week in which the public may have been exposed. The locations are listed below.

"The county and the state are experiencing an epidemic of pertussis," said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. "Infants are at greatest risk for severe illness and death from pertussis, so we are urging parents to vaccinate their children and pregnant women to be vaccinated to protect their babies."

There have been 895 confirmed cases of pertussis in 2014. There were only 120 cases reported at this same time last year [2013] and a total of 431 in [all of] 2013. Pertussis activity hit a record high in 2010 with 1179 cases.

A typical case of pertussis starts with a cough and runny nose for one to 2 weeks, followed by weeks to months of rapid coughing fits that sometimes end with a whooping sound (http://www.whoopingcough.net/sound%20of%20whooping%20cough%20with%20much%20whooping.htm). Fever, if present, is usually mild. Antibiotics can lessen the severity of symptoms and prevent the spread of disease to others.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the following vaccination schedule: Young children need 5 doses of DTaP by kindergarten: at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months and 4 to 6 years; All students entering 7th grade need proof of a whooping cough booster immunization (Tdap). A Tdap booster is recommended for pregnant women during their 3rd trimester of each pregnancy, even if they got a booster before becoming pregnant. One dose of Tdap is recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent.

Parents can obtain the DTaP vaccine series and the Tdap booster shot for themselves and their children through their primary care physicians. Local retail pharmacies offer vaccinations for a fee, and anyone who is not covered by a medical insurance plan can get the shot from a County Public Health Center at minimal or no cost (http://www.sdcounty.ca.gov/hhsa/programs/phs/immunization_branch/immunizations_free_for_children_under_age_two.html).

In the midst of a state-wide whooping cough epidemic, the number of Yolo County cases jumped from 37 to 80 in the past month. [Yolo County is a relatively rural agricultural region located in the Sacramento Valley immediately east of Napa County and is included in the Sacramento-Roseville-Arden-Arcade, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolo_County,_California#Adjacent_counties).]

"We have already seen over 5400 cases of pertussis in California this year [2014] as compared to a total of 2372 cases in all of 2013," said Constance Caldwell, Yolo County health officer. "In Yolo County, we have seen nearly 80 cases so far in 2014, compared to 4 cases in all of 2013." These cases represent ages from 6 weeks to 60 years old.

Health officials continue to be alarmed that the number of cases has soared since 1 Jan [2014], with the traditional peak month of July [2014]. As of 11 Jul 2014, the number of cases is now at 5393, more than double the 2532 reported for all of 2013, according to the state's Department of Public Health. As of 10 Jun 2014, there had been only 3458 reported cases, for an increase of 1935 in the past month.

Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a bacterial illness which causes severe coughing fits that can last for weeks, according to Caldwell. It is spread easily by coughing on others and is most dangerous in young infants who can become severely ill very quickly and even die from it.

Pertussis is cyclical and peaks every 3 to 5 years. The last peak in California occurred in 2010, so it is likely another peak is underway, according to the California Department of Public Health.

Although Yolo County cases shot up to 80 in the past month, Marin, Napa and Sonoma counties [counties just north of the city of San Francisco] have the highest whooping cough rates in the state, with 168, 124, and 589 cases, respectively.

"The symptoms of pertussis vary by age," Caldwell said. "For children, a typical case of pertussis starts with a cough and runny nose for one to 2 weeks. The cough then worsens, and children may have rapid coughing spells that end with a whooping sound."

Overall whooping cough rates are highest for babies under one year old, followed by adolescents and teens from 10 to 17 years old, with the peak age at 15 years old, according to the California Department of Public Health.

"Young infants may not have typical pertussis symptoms and may have no apparent cough," Caldwell noted. "Parents may describe episodes in which the infant's face turns red or purple." For adults, pertussis may simply be a cough that persists for several weeks.

"Prevention of the illness with the vaccine is the best course of action," she said. "However, immunity from pertussis is not life-long."

Infants too young to be fully immunized remain most vulnerable to severe and fatal cases of pertussis. Two infant deaths have been reported and 2/3rds of pertussis hospitalizations have been in children 4 months or younger. One of the deaths was a 2-month-old infant who was 5 weeks old at time of disease onset.

The Tdap vaccination for pregnant women is the best way to protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated. All pregnant women should be vaccinated with Tdap in the 3rd trimester of each pregnancy, regardless of previous Tdap vaccination. Pertussis antibodies are transferred from vaccinated mothers to their infants and will help protect them until they are old enough to be vaccinated. In addition, infants should be vaccinated as soon as possible. The 1st dose of pertussis vaccine can be given as early as 6 weeks of age.

"Students entering 7th grade also receive a booster dose, as should health care workers and others working with infants and young children," Caldwell said.

[Pertussis has been on the increase throughout most of the world. This has been attributed in part to increased virulence and other genetic changes in the circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, as well as waning or an ineffective immune response after vaccination.
