Manila to slaughter 6000 pigs to stop Ebola spread
--------------------------------------------------
The Philippines will slaughter 6000 pigs at a hog farm north of the
capital Manila to prevent the spread of the Ebola-Reston virus,
health and farm officials said on Monday [23 Feb 2009].

But the government has lifted a quarantine on a 2nd hog farm after
tests by experts from the World Health Organisation (WHO), World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and Food and the Agriculture
Organisation (FAO) showed no more signs of the disease.

The country has more than 13 million heads of swine and the discovery
of Ebola-Reston on 2 hog farms north of Manila was isolated, the
government said.

"There is ongoing viral transmission in Bulacan ... as a
precautionary measure, depopulation will be carried out in the
Bulacan farm," health secretary Francisco Duque told reporters,
referring to the farm just north of Manila.

The government said 6000 pigs would be killed, burned, and buried as
experts sought to determine the source of Ebola-Reston in pigs as
well as pig-to-pig and from pig-to-human transmission. Duque said 147
human samples have been tested for Ebola, but only 6 have tested
positive. But all 6 remain healthy, he added.

"Ebola-Reston poses a low risk to human health at this time," Duque said.

It is the 1st time the virus has been found outside monkeys and the
1st time it has been found in pigs. The virus had previously jumped
from monkeys to humans but this was the 1st case of a jump from hogs.

The Ebola-Reston virus was found in the Philippines as early as the
late 1980s and 25 people were found infected after contact with sick
monkeys. But only one developed flu-like symptoms and later recovered.
