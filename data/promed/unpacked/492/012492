[These represent the following increases in numbers of YF cases
(deaths) since the WHO report in Yellow Fever - South America: update
(03) below):
Colombia 12 (6)
Peru 12 (7)
Venezuela 6 (5)
Considering that countries are required under the International
Health Regulations to report cases of YF to WHO Geneva within 24
hours, it is disappointing to see that it has taken a minimum of 9
days, e.g., 10-19 Sep for Peru, for these countries to make their
reports. - Mod.JW]
