[ProMED-mail's posting "Avian influenza (186) - Netherlands, H5N1: NOT, RFI
20060827.2439", dated 27 Aug 2006, included the following request for
information: "The current news release mentions investigations in 2 birds.
Results pertaining to tests (if carried out) of the other 2 allegedly
involved birds and the postulated cause of death of all 4 if H5N1 is
excluded will be helpful in the final accomplishment of the investigation
of this unusual event." We are glad to publish the following response,

Response to "Avian influenza (186) - Netherlands, H5N1: NOT, RFI"
-----------------------------------------------
We hereby respond to the request for information in the recent post (Avian
influenza (186) - Netherlands, H5N1: NOT, RFI) about suspected H5N1 virus
infection in northern hawk owls (_Surnia ulula_) from Rotterdam Zoo.
In total, 4 hawk owls were examined. As reported previously (Avian
influenza (186) - Netherlands, H5N1: NOT, RFI), 2 of these birds (birds 2
and 3), which died with neurological signs, were initially suspected of
infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the subtype H5N1,
but no influenza virus could be isolated from their tissues. Tissues of the
2 other birds (birds 1 and 4), which also showed neurological signs and
were euthanized, tested negative in PCRs for the influenza virus matrix
gene and for subtype H5 of the hemagglutinin gene, and no further
virological tests were performed.
Based on histopathology and bacteriology, bird 3 had a meningo-encephalitis
and septicemia due to _Escherichia coli_ infection. Bird 2 had an
encephalitis of unknown origin.
The cause of neurological disease in the remaining 3 birds is still open.
The tissues of birds 2 and 3 tested negative in PCRs for Newcastle disease
virus, paramyxovirus, and West Nile virus. Further tests are ongoing and
will be reported if a diagnosis is made.
An extensive epidemiological investigation was started in the zoo. In
throat and cloaca swabs of 72 birds that were looked after by the same
animal care takers as the PCR-positive owls all tested negative by PCR. In
addition, sera of 50 non-vaccinated birds housed in the same cages tested
negative in the hemagglutination inhibition test against H5N1 antigen.
