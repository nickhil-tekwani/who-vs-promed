Antrim _Escherichia coli_ outbreak: toll rises to 12
----------------------------------------------------
The number of people suffering from _E. coli_ O157 infection in Antrim has
risen to 12. The latest victims are believed to be relatives of children
from the day nursery where the outbreak was first detected. The Northern
Health Board has said it is working towards finding the source of the
outbreak, which has already infected 9 children at the nursery.
Laura's Lodge Day Nursery closed voluntarily last Thu, 11 Sep 2003,
following advice from environmental health officers and the Northern Health
Board.

[Transmission of Verotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (VTEC) such as
O157:H7 from children to adults as household contacts can also produce
hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), although HUS may also occur independent of
VTEC. These latter cases (not associated with VTEC) have a substantial
mortality rate and risk of relapse. VTEC-associated HUS in adults has a low
mortality rate and does not relapse but does progress in some cases to
chronic renal failure.
