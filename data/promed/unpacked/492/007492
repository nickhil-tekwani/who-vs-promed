A Lambton County [Southwestern Ontario] resident has tested positive for the West Nile virus, the 1st lab-confirmed human case this year [2020], Lambton Public Health said. Testing of mosquito pools in Petrolia and Oil Springs had already shown the virus was present.

Ontario has had 24 human cases, which are often confirmed in late summer and early fall, late in the mosquito season.

West Nile virus is spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito.

The health unit reminds residents to remain vigilant to prevent mosquito bites and eliminate mosquito-breeding sites on their property. Mosquitoes remain active until frost and below-zero [deg C; 32 deg F] temperatures arrive.

[West Nile virus (WNV) occurs across southern Canada. Lambton County is in far southern Ontario province, across from Detroit, Michigan, USA. Although Ontario has reported 24 human cases this year (2020), this is the 1st case there that has come to ProMED's attention. WNV transmission can be expected for a few more days in Ontario, until the 1st hard frosts of the season occur. Meanwhile, residents of the area should continue to avoid mosquito bites and horses should be vaccinated against the virus. - Mod.TY
