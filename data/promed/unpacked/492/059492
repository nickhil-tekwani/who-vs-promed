[Exactly a year after the initial reported confirmation of FMDV
serotype O in PRC (Guangdong), which, according to the official
report, was the 1st outbreak of this serotype in PRC since 1999, the
epizootic is still live and kicking. So far, 19 outbreaks have been
reported to the OIE, stretching throughout the entire mega state, from
Guangdong in the east to Xinjiang in the west; see map at
<http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8988>.
Most likely (see further data from Hong Kong), the causative agent of
this epizootic is topotype SEA, strain Mya-98, the same virus strain
responsible for major 2010 outbreaks in several countries around China
(in brackets, starting dates as reported to the OIE): Japan (7 Apr
2010), S. Korea (21 Apr 2010 and 26 Nov 2010), Mongolia (21 Apr 2010
and 26 Aug 2010), Kazakhstan (9 Jun 2010), Russia (5 Jul 2010 and 26
Aug 2010, both adjacent to the Chinese/Mongolian borders), N. Korea
(25 Dec 2010).

To the best of our knowledge, no official information is available on
the genotyping of the Chinese strain. However, 14 isolates from Hong
Kong - SAR (which reports separately to the OIE), collected 5 Feb
2010, were sent to the World Reference Laboratory at Pirbright (WRL)
and genotyped there as the said SEA genotype, strain Mya-98; see
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/hkn.htm>.

Hong-Kong has served, for decades, as a useful sentinel for FMD in
China, as apparent from the impressive record of samples submissions
to the WRL.

China's transparency has significantly improved since the SARS event;
this trend deserves to be further encouraged in the country, which
maintains some half of the world's swine population and a considerable
percentage of the world's domestic large and small ruminant
population. - Mod.AS]
