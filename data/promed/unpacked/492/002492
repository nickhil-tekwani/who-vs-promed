The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is alerting consumers that
Mars Petcare US, Inc. has recalled 2 dry dog food products because of
the potential contamination with _Salmonella_ Schwarzengrund.
The Mars Petcare US, based in Franklin, Tennessee, is voluntarily
recalling 5-pound (2.3 kg) bags of Krasdale Gravy dry dog food sold
in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and
Pennsylvania, and 50-pound (22.7 kg) bags of Red Flannel Large Breed
Adult Formula dry food sold in Pennsylvania.
The FDA conducted tests on 10 samples, representing 7 product brands
from the company. Each sample (same size and brand of product)
consisted of 15 subsamples, for a total of 150 subsamples. Tests of
the 150 subsamples revealed 2 positive samples; one from the Krasdale
Gravy dry food and another from Red Flannel Large Breed Adult Formula dry food.
_Salmonella_ can potentially be transferred to people handling pet
food, especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after
having contact with the product or any surfaces exposed to the
product. To date, there have been 64 cases of illness in humans
related to _Salmonella_ Schwarzengrund reported to the CDC (US
Centers for Disease Control & Prevention); however, none of the
reported cases have been directly linked to the recalled product that
was tested. The FDA is working with local and state officials, and
with officials at the CDC in the investigation.
Here is identification information on the recalled products:
Product: Krasdale Gravy dry dog food
Size: 5-pound bag
UPC Code: 7513062596
Best By Date: 16 Jul 2008 & 17 Jul 2008
Best By Date Location: Back of bag
Distribution: Stores in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New
York, and Pennsylvania
Product: Red Flannel Large Breed Adult Formula dry dog food
Size: 50-pound bag
UPC Code: 4286900062
Best By Date: 12 Jul 2008
Best By Date Location: Back of bag
Distribution: Stores in Reedsland and Richlandtown, PA.
Pets with _Salmonella_ infections may be lethargic and have diarrhea
or bloody diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. Some pets will have only
decreased appetite, fever, and abdominal pain. Well animals can be
carriers and infect other animals or humans. If your pet has consumed
the recalled product and has these symptoms, please contact your veterinarian.
Consumers with questions about the recalled product should call Mars
Petcare US, Inc. at 866-298-8332.

[This is the FDA recall notice from several days ago related to the
dog food. It should be noted that 23 of the 66 (35 percent) CDC
reported _S._ Schwarzengrund outbreak strain cases were in states not
listed for distribution of the canine food. The distribution of the
food was limited to the northeastern part of the country, but cases
have been reported from Ohio, Maine, North Dakota, Virginia,
Minnesota, Alabama, California, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky,
Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. Unless the cases
have links to the distribution states, other company products not yet
recalled are likely involved. - Mod.LL]
