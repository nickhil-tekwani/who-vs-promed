The heading [of the prior posting cited above should more correctly read
Tick typhus rather than Scrub typhus. Scrub typhus (Tsutsugamushi disease)
although also a rickettsiosis is transmitted by larval mites [chiggers
-Mod.ES i.e. it is a mite-borne typhus. Scrub typhus does not occur in
South Africa.
The report was very useful for travellers to this part of the world
especially those spending time out of doors. It is more common in the
summer months when the tick populations are high. The eschar is very
characteristic when present (sometimes even found on the scalp by the
astute examiner) and in this part of the world almost pathognomonic for the
disease which we refer to as "tick bite fever".
It is interesting to note that the initial diagnosis of this disease is
often missed by medical personnel, emphasising the fact that a good general
and travel history is of vital importance. Locally the disease is not too
severe in younger persons but may be fatal in older patients if not
diagnosed early and treated promptly. We have had good results with both
tetracycline and doxycycline (often easier to obtain in IV form here).

The etiologic agent of Scrub typhus is _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ formally
_Rickettsia tsutsugamushi_. The vectors of Scrub typhus are larval mites
of the Family _Trombiculidae_ called chiggers. Scrub typhus is found
throughout southeast Asia, to date, I don't believe it has been found in
Africa. _Rickettsia_ vectored by ticks are usually termed spotted fever
group _Rickettsia_.
