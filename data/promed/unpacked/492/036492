The Secretariat of Health of Bahia, in north eastern Brazil, reported today
[5 May 2010] that 330 cases of meningitis have been confirmed in the state
so far this year [2010], 39 of them fatal. 27 of the deaths were caused by
type C [meningococcal] meningitis, the most severe form of the disease.

Also according to the Secretariat, there was increased mortality of the
disease in the previous year [2009], from 25.4 to 31.1 per cent.

Throughout 2009, 1511 cases of meningitis and 152 deaths were registered in
Bahia.

[The state of Bahia is one of 26 states of Brazil and is located in the
north eastern part of the country on the Atlantic coast. The population of
Bahia in 2008 was 14 109 000; the capital is Salvador, with a population of
2.8 million (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahia>).

Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis in Brazil in the past have been due
to both serogroups B and C (see ProMED-mail post: Meningitis, meningococcal
- Brazil 19960125.0182). There seems to be an ongoing outbreak of
meningococcal meningitis in Bahia. However, the numbers of cases and deaths
in Bahia in 2009 reported in the news release above are different from
those reported in a previous ProMED-mail posting. According to a
ProMED-mail post "Meningitis, meningococcal - Brazil (02): (BA) RFI
20091212.4229", as of 10 Dec 2009, there were 2218 total cases of
meningococcal meningitis with 138 deaths, and 178 cases of serogroup C
meningococcal meningitis with 48 deaths (27 per cent case fatality rate) in
2009.

In addition, the case fatality rates given in the above news release do not
fit the reported data. The case fatality rate in 2010, using the numbers
given in the above news release, is 11.8 per cent (39 deaths in 330 cases),
not 31.1 per cent, unless this higher rate refers to deaths from serogroup
C disease; but then the total number of cases of serogroup C disease is not
given.
