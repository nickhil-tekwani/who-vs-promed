Occurrence of potato wart caused by _Synchytrium endobioticum_ on Prince
Edward Island, Canada. SH De Boer, Centre for Animal and Plant Health,
Canadian Food Inspection Agency, 93 Mount Edward Road, Charlottetown, PE
C1A 5T1, Canada. Plant Dis 2001; 85:1292. Published online as
D-2001-1017-02N, 2001. Accepted for publication 25 Sep 2001.
During harvest (October 2000) of a 26 hectare (ha) field of processing
potatoes (cultivar (cv) Russet Burbank) on Prince Edward Island (PEI), a
small number of tubers with signs of potato wart [PW were found in a 1 ha
area of the field. Resting sporangia of _Synchytrium endobioticum_ were
present in diseased tissue.
[PW ... is not endemic in Canada outside of Newfoundland, where the
disease has occurred since 1909, and has been under official quarantine
control since 1912 (1). In the United States, [PW was eradicated from
Pennsylvania and West Virginia by 1974 and, more recently, was eradicated
from Maryland, where its presence had been reconfirmed in 1987 (2).
Anecdotal information pertaining to the PEI field suggests that the source
of infection may have been infected tubers from Newfoundland that were
grown in this portion of the field many years ago. Cv Russet Burbank is
resistant to pathotype 1, which occurs in the United Kingdom, but is
susceptible to pathotype 2, which predominates in Newfoundland (1). A soil
survey confirmed the presence of _S. endobioticum_ resting sporangia in the
1 ha area in which the symptomatic tubers were found. Concentrations of
sporangia ranged from <1 to 124 sporangi[a per g of air-dried soil.
Resting sporangia of _S. endobioticum_ were not found in soil samples from
fields within a 0.8 km radius of the infested field, nearby garden plots,
or fields in which the same equipment had been used since 1984.

[PW is a devastating disease of potato; severe cases result in complete
crop failure. Resting spores of _Synchytrium endobioticum_ can remain
viable for at least 40 years, thus supporting the suggestion that the
current infection is linked to a previous crop grown on infested land.
Failure to detect resting spores in soil collected within a 0.8 km radius
of the infested field in encouraging, but this does not mean that the
pathogen has been eliminated.
An agreement between the Canadian and PEI governments will provide $14.1
million to assist the province's potato growers following the closure of
the US border to PEI potatoes. $12.6 million in federal funds, expected to
be matched by provincial funding, will be used to finance disposal of
surplus potatoes accumulated following the US restrictions. The Canadian
government will also contribute up to $1.5 million to supply surplus
potatoes to food banks across Canada. Moreover, PEI potato growers will
receive funds under the emergency farm assistance program announced earlier
this month, and also under the Canadian Farm Income Program (CFIP).
Meanwhile, the US government is requesting potato wart inspections across
PEI to a 4 year program, likely adding another $1 million to the total cost
of province-wide inspections. The new demand came in November 2001 as an
attachment to a protocol sampling agreement finalized last spring between
both countries. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency will closely monitor
Island potato fields, farms and warehouses for PW.
