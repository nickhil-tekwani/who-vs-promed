The Marion County Health Department has reported an outbreak of more than
76 cases of shigellosis spread among 14 day care centers. Patients have
included both young children and family members who have contracted the
illness after exposure to contaminated toys or diapers. Antimicrobial
therapy has been used in some cases, and food handlers are being screened
in an effort to identify the primary source(s). The principal Health
Department recommendation is that careful handwashing practices be used to
limit the spread of the disease.
