Statement by Dr Keiji Fukuda on behalf of the WHO at the Council of
Europe hearing on pandemic (H1N1) 2009
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ther World Health Organization (WHO) is pleased to take part in this
hearing, and thanks the Council of Europe for taking this initiative.
The H1N1 influenza pandemic has created immensely complicated
challenges for countries as well as the global community. At the same
time, rising to this challenge has created an unprecedented level of
global cooperation and coordination among countries in confronting a
fast-moving threat in this increasingly linked and globalized world.
There is much to learn about how the world can improve its handling
of such events and a need to separate fact from rhetoric. Again, we
welcome this opportunity.

I would like to place the current experience in a historical and
scientific context. The WHO is a specialized agency of the United
Nations with 193 Member States. The WHO implements the global health
policies decided upon by these countries and provides technical
support to the countries. The WHO takes very seriously its role of
helping all countries to protect and improve the health of their
populations. The response to the H1N1 pandemic is just one example.

In 1946, when plans for establishing the WHO were being discussed,
one of the 1st actions agreed upon was the creation of a worldwide
network of laboratories to monitor influenza viruses. That network
became operational 2 years before the WHO itself began its work.

There were good reasons for this sense of priority and urgency. 1st,
influenza viruses mutate constantly and are notoriously
unpredictable. And 2nd, influenza was known to cause both seasonal
epidemics of disease, and on occasion, much larger global outbreaks
of disease, known as pandemics. Influenza pandemics occur when a new
influenza virus appears and spreads around the world in populations
which previously have not been exposed to the virus. History has
shown that influenza pandemics can range enormously in their impact
but that it is impossible to accurately predict the eventual impact
at the beginning. What is seen early may be very different from what
has been experienced by the end. The 1918 influenza pandemic, which
killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide, started with
relatively mild waves of illness and then evolved into the most
severe influenza pandemic in history.

Preparedness
------------
Over decades, the WHO has worked with its Member States and partners
to strengthen global defences against influenza as well as other
major health threats. Such efforts include the strengthening of
laboratories, epidemiological investigations, clinical care and
communications, as well as the building of new capacities such as the
International Health Regulations, to which I will return later. One
result has been to significantly strengthen the broad global and
national foundations essential for detecting, assessing, and
responding to many health threats and not only influenza. The WHO
network of influenza laboratories, 1st conceived in 1946, now
encompasses 139 national laboratories in 101 countries which
collectively work together under the coordination of the WHO. This
network provides rapid warning and expert scientific assessment as
well as the information essential for keeping influenza vaccines updated.

This system did not catch the very start of the 1957 and 1968
pandemics, but did quickly confirm, for both pandemics, that
explosive outbreaks of respiratory disease in Asia were caused by
novel influenza viruses. This allowed the WHO, in both instances, to
alert the world to prepare for the international spread of a pandemic.

In 1918, vaccines were not an option. For both the 1957 and 1968
pandemics, vaccines were produced round-the-clock but arrived too
late. Worldwide, the 1957 pandemic caused more than 2 million deaths
while the pandemic of 1968 caused around one million deaths. Although
both were less severe in comparison to 1918, by any other
measurement, such numbers of preventable deaths are large and
unacceptable. Terms such as "severe" and "mild" are relative when it
comes to pandemics.

The WHO issued its 1st influenza pandemic preparedness plan in 1999,
2 years after a serious outbreak of avian H5N1 influenza in Hong
Kong, SAR. This document was part of an intensified effort to help
countries prepare for future pandemics and was updated in 2005 and
again in 2009. These public documents, which form a historical record
and provide recommendations to countries, were based upon the
collective input of public health and scientific experts from around
the world. The documents are built around the idea of phases,
including a pandemic phase, and provide recommended actions to be
taken by countries and the WHO depending on the real world situation.

The 2009 version provides an example of the effort that went into
these plans. The work began in 2007 and involved contributions from
more than 135 public health scientists from 48 countries. An
invitation to countries for additional comments on a draft document
resulted in more than 600 replies. This work was completed in
February of 2009 and published in April of that year.

The H1N1 pandemic
-----------------
In April 2009, the WHO was informed of human infections caused by a
new H1N1 virus. The report was of immediate concern because the genes
contained in the virus were from animal influenza viruses,
definitively establishing this virus as very different from the usual
seasonal human influenza viruses. Further laboratory testing
confirmed that existing antibodies to the current human H1N1 viruses
did not react to the new H1N1 virus further underscoring the
potential of the new virus to cause a pandemic. But the most
important information was when investigations indicated that this new
virus was causing community outbreaks with person to person spread.

In Mexico, early outbreaks included deaths and severe respiratory
illnesses requiring ventilators among previously healthy young
people. The WHO took decisive actions in accordance with the
International Health Regulations but did not announce the start of a
pandemic until 11 Jun 2009 when the updated pandemic criteria were
met. The new virus spread with unprecedented speed, reaching 120
countries and territories in about 8 weeks, and now has been reported
from virtually all countries.

The H1N1 pandemic is not the same as seasonal influenza and differs
in major respects. Large outbreaks occurred outside the usual season
for influenza. The virus caused a striking and unusual pattern of
severe illness and deaths in younger people, with many deaths caused
by viral pneumonia, an especially aggressive form of pneumonia. This
pattern is not typically seen during seasonal influenza.

The pandemic is not over, but to date, more than 14 000
laboratory-confirmed deaths have been reported. We often see the
number of deaths compared with figures from seasonal influenza. This
is like comparing apples with oranges. Deaths from seasonal influenza
are based on statistical models. Deaths from the pandemic have been
confirmed one by one through laboratory tests and unquestionably are
much lower than the true number. It usually takes about one to 2
years after the end of a pandemic to get more realistic estimates of
deaths using statistical modelling.

International Health Regulations and the Emergency Committee
------------------------------------------------------------
I now want to focus on the International Health Regulations or IHR as
they are often called, and the Emergency Committee. Revised in 2005,
the IHR provide the world with an orderly, rules-based framework for
detecting, assessing, reporting, declaring and responding to public
health emergencies of international concern. They also provide the
world with a system of checks and balances to ensure that no one,
including the WHO Director-General, has unfettered power when making decisions.

When a possible public health emergency of international concern
occurs, the IHR calls for the establishment of an Emergency Committee
to advise the WHO Director-General. The Committee's membership is
drawn from a larger roster, also established under the IHR, of people
who are selected from around the world on the basis of their
individual technical expertise.

The Emergency Committee met multiple times to advise the WHO
Director-General on phase changes as well as temporary
recommendations. When the Emergency Committee met to discuss a
possible move to a declaration of a pandemic, the Emergency Committee
meeting additionally included members who represented Australia,
Canada, Chile, Japan, Mexico, Spain, UK, and the USA, 8 countries
that experienced widespread outbreaks at the time. These national
representatives were present to ensure full consideration of the
views and possible reservations of the countries expected to bear the
initial brunt of economic and social repercussions.

On 11 Jun 2009, the Committee and all national representatives
advised the Director-General that all criteria required for declaring
an influenza pandemic had been met. The decision was unanimous.

Pharmaceutical industry
-----------------------
Recently, accusations have been made that policies and
recommendations of the WHO were influenced by the pharmaceutical
industry. Providing independent advice to Member States is a very
important function of the WHO that is taken seriously. The WHO guards
against the influence of any improper interests.

Let me state clearly for the record. The influenza pandemic policies
and responses recommended and taken by the WHO were not improperly
influenced by the pharmaceutical industry.

The WHO recognizes that global cooperation with a range of partners,
including the private sector, is essential for optimally addressing
the public health challenges of today and tomorrow. Numerous
safeguards are in place to manage conflicts of interest or perceived
conflicts of interest among members of WHO advisory groups and expert
committees. Expert advisers provide a signed declaration of interests
to the WHO detailing any professional or financial matters that could
affect the impartiality of their advice. The WHO takes allegations of
conflicts of interest seriously and is confident of the integrity and
scientific validity of its decision-making during this influenza
pandemic. An explanation of how the WHO uses advisory bodies in
responding to the influenza pandemic was made publicly available on
the WHO web site on 3 Dec 2009.

Closing remarks
---------------
In closing, I would like to reiterate the most basic point. This
current influenza pandemic is a scientifically well-documented event
in which the emergence and spread of a new influenza virus has caused
an unusual epidemiological pattern of disease throughout the world.
This is not an arbitrary matter of word-smithing, definitions or
polemics. The labelling of the pandemic as "fake" is to ignore recent
history and science and to trivialize the deaths of more than 14 000
people and the many additional serious illnesses experienced by others.

As we go forward, the world will continue to face many difficult
health challenges. The resources to face them are limited, especially
among developing countries, and finding ways to do this better is the
shared responsibility of Member States and organizations, such as the
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, as well as the WHO. Thank you.

some European parliamentarians of what they considered to be the
premature designation of the influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus outbreak as
a pandemic, and the consequent profits accrued by the pharmaceutical
industry. - Mod.CP]
