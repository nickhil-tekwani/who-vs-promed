A cluster outbreak of pneumococcal disease at Harland and Wolff [1] in Belfast is being investigated after a small number of employees have been confirmed as having the infection. The Public Health Agency (PHA) is working with the Health & Safety Executive Northern Ireland (HSENI) and Port Health colleagues to investigate the cluster outbreak. The PHA said is working closely with Harland and Wolff and hygiene advice has been given to employees.

Welders or people exposed to welding fumes in their job are among those at more risk of developing a pneumococcal infection, the agency explained. Vaccination is being offered to employees working in high-risk exposure areas as a preventative measure. The disease is spread by close contact, particularly coughs or sneezes, but there is said to be no wider risk to the public.

Pneumococcal disease is a term used to describe the range of infections caused by a bacterium called _ Streptococcus pneumonia_.

In Northern Ireland there are around 50-60 cases a year and the bacteria can cause a variety of infections ranging from sinusitis and ear infections to more serious illnesses such as pneumonia, meningitis, and blood poisoning [bacteremia, sepsis].

[1. Harland & Wolff Heavy Industries, located in Belfast, Northern Ireland, is a heavy industrial company, specializing in shipbuilding; offshore construction (wind- and marine-generated electricity) constitutes 75 per cent of the company's work as of 2011 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harland_and_Wolff)].

[The news report above does not tell us the number of case-patients of pneumococcal disease involved in the outbreak, over what period of time the outbreak occurred, what type of work the patients were engaged in or the workplace location at Harland & Wolff, characteristics of the patients (such as age, sex), medical conditions predisposing to pneumococcal disease (such as, chronic cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal dysfunction), history of previous pneumococcal vaccination, how the diagnoses were confirmed, the types of pneumococcal infection involved in the outbreak, or serotypes or genotypes of the _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ causing the infections. More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.

_Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (pneumococcus) is a Gram positive bacterium with more than 90 known serotypes, based on the antigenic specificity of the organism's capsular polysaccharide. Pneumococci are spread when nasopharyngeal carriers of the organism sneeze or cough, releasing airborne droplets among close contacts in crowded settings. Pneumococci can cause an asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carrier state, otitis media, sinusitis, non-bacteremic pneumonia, and invasive pneumococcal disease, such as bacteremic pneumonia, septic arthritis, endocarditis, peritonitis, and meningitis. At high risk of invasive pneumococcal disease are children younger than 2 years of age, persons who have certain underlying conditions such as HIV infection, and those 65 years of age and older. Although all serotypes may cause serious disease, a relatively limited number of serotypes cause the majority of invasive pneumococcal disease.

Outbreaks of pneumococcal disease have been reported in nursing homes (http://www.immunize.org/reports/report053.asp), shelters for the homeless (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7420632?dopt=Abstract), military camps (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/3/441.abstract?ijkey=480be94b029ef0ef87beb11be36bfeb82d99300e&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha), and childcare centers (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2717096/). A large clonal outbreak due to serotype 5 with a particular genotype (ST289) occurred in western Canada in the years 2005-2009, mostly affecting middle-aged men (median 41 years of age) who were homelessness, illicit drugs users, and people of First Nations [various Aboriginal peoples in Canada who are neither Inuit nor Metis] heritage (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/5/11-0235_article). This Canadian outbreak might have gone unrecognized if it were not for a surveillance program in place to document fluctuations in serotype prevalence.

In 2000, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of the pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV7) for all children aged 2-23 months and for children aged 24-59 months who are at increased risk for pneumococcal disease (such as children with anatomic or functional asplenia, sickle cell disease, HIV infection or other immunocompromising conditions, or chronic illness including chronic heart or lung disease, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, and diabetes mellitus). PCV7 covers pneumococcal serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F. In 2007, the ACIP revised its recommendation for routine use to include all children aged 2-59 months (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt11-pneumo.html).

Following the introduction of PCV7 in 2000, dramatic declines in invasive pneumococcal disease were reported among children aged less than 5 years as early as 2001 and a lower pneumococcal disease burden was noted in the rest of the population as well, through reduced transmission of pneumococcal vaccine serotypes (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt11-pneumo.html).

In 2010, the ACIP recommended use of a pneumococcal conjugate 13-valent vaccine (PCV13), with 6 serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A) in addition to the 7 serotypes that are in PCV7, for 1) all children aged 2-59 months; 2) children aged 60-71 months with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for pneumococcal disease or complications (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5911a1.htm), and 3) adults aged 19 years and older with immunocompromising conditions, a cerebrospinal fluid leak, or a cochlear implant (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6140a4.htm#tab).

Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), which consists of capsular material from 23 pneumococcal serotypes that historically caused approximately 85 to 90 per cent of cases of pneumococcal disease, is recommended in the US for all adults 65 years of age and older and in younger adults who have a condition that increases the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease or pneumococcal pneumonia.

A clonal outbreak of pneumococcal disease has been reported in a setting of low vaccination coverage in residents of a nursing home, which underscores the importance of providing pneumococcal vaccine to high-risk people (http://www.immunize.org/reports/report053.asp). - Mod.ML
