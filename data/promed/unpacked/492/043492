A ruling on Monday [18 Apr 2022] by a "not qualified" judge...is a bleak reminder that, for many Americans, having to wear a mask occasionally has been the worst thing about the COVID-19 pandemic.

It certainly isn't the unknown number of people who still struggle with COVID's lingering effects or the millions of children who lost parents or guardians to the virus. It's not the thought of those who left this world alone without the final comfort of a loved one's touch. It's not the grocery store employees who lost their lives because they didn't have the luxury of working safely at home.

Judging from the jubilant reactions posted on social media after airline employees announced mid-flight that passengers were no longer required to wear a mask, they weren't thinking about the more than 6.2 million people killed by COVID -- nearly 990 000 in this nation alone, the highest death toll in the world. Buoyed by the selfishness that has prolonged this pandemic, they think only of themselves.

Of course,...US District Court Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle's vexing decision to void the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's national mask mandate for public transportation doesn't affect only air travelers. It also applies on trains, buses, and boats. Uber, the ride-hailing company, won't require masks for drivers or passengers.

Throwing out the mask mandate reeks of the privilege of someone who doesn't rely on public transportation. Airplanes may have great ventilation and filtration systems, but the same cannot be said of many subways and buses. On Tuesday [19 Apr 2022], the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) rescinded its mask mandate for all customers, except users of The RIDE paratransit services.

After Mizelle's ruling, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said, "This is obviously a disappointing decision." That's not much of a response. It makes me wonder if the Biden administration may see the end of this mask mandate, conveniently not by its own hand, as one less political liability to shoulder before the midterm elections. President Biden said Tuesday [19 Apr 2022] that it's "up to" Americans to decide whether they should wear a mask. The Transportation Security Administration had already announced it would no longer enforce the mask mandate.

"This was a legal decision, not a public health decision, and it was abrupt," Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said during a Tuesday [19 Apr 2022] segment. "All of a sudden masks came off, families and travelers who were fully anticipating they would still be able to travel in a masked environment suddenly could not. Children under the age of 5 who've not been able to be vaccinated -- again, feeling more comfortable in a masked environment -- suddenly were not in a masked environment."

All of this is happening as BA.2, an even more transmissible omicron subvariant, is causing COVID infections to rise again. Vaccinations have stalled. There are about 40 000 new cases a day, and it's probably higher, since people generally do not report home test results. Between 400 and 500 people die every day. Such numbers aren't as dire as those during the height of the delta and omicron waves, but it still means that thousands continue to die from COVID each week.

As a nation, Americans never nailed the whole "we're in this together" thing during this ongoing pandemic. The greatest public health crisis of our lifetime has often been met with indifference.... While refrigerated trucks were parked outside of hospitals as mobile morgues to accommodate the overwhelming number of COVID deaths, some preferred to burn masks to protest pandemic restrictions.

Once headlines verified what many of us anticipated -- that COVID, enabled by systemic and institutional racism, would have a disproportionate impact on Black and brown communities -- scores of white people, some of them armed, took to the streets and state houses for raucous anti-lockdown tantrums.

People went from cheering healthcare workers to cheering the fact that they would no longer have to use one of the most effective mitigation devices during this pandemic. That puts the elderly, immunocompromised, and children too young to be vaccinated at risk. What's being hailed as a victory for independence and personal choice feels like surrender.

I haven't been on a plane since March 2020. I had the middle seat, wedged between an open-mouth snorer and a woman who coughed most of the trip from Charleston, SC, to Boston. No one on the flight wore a mask because few recognized COVID as a threat. Now we know better -- or should -- and many will still be happily unmasked on public transportation. I won't be one of them.

During these past 2 unprecedented years, I've often thought about something Michelle Obama said: "Being president doesn't change who you are. It reveals who you are." That can also be applied to how this nation has handled the pandemic. The COVID crisis has not changed America, but revealed its churlishness and cruelties, both unchecked and now unmasked.

[From MedPage Today (https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/98284): "...The American Medical Association (AMA) did not comment directly on the ruling, but AMA president Gerald Harmon, MD, said in an email that the AMA 'strongly supports the legal authority of health officials to enact reasonable, evidence-based public health measures when necessary to protect the public from serious illness, injury, and death. We know that wearing a well-fitted, medical-grade mask is an effective public health measure that helps limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and helps protect those who remain vulnerable to COVID-19.'

"'On planes and public transportation and in numerous other congregate settings, medical grade masks have slowed the spread of COVID-19 infections,' he added. 'With a highly transmissible BA.2 variant now dominant in many parts of the country, we urge everyone to remain vigilant, and, if they haven't done so already, get vaccinated and get boosted.'

"Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, who was in Las Vegas on Tuesday [19 Apr 2022] for a mental health event, said he 'will respect the ruling, but I follow the science and I would urge people to take every precaution they think necessary to protect themselves,' especially if they're older or immunocompromised. He added that the administration is 'right now in the process of deciding -- we likely will appeal that ruling, but stay tuned.'"

People are understandably confused over how best to proceed with masks. "...Masks are ultimately designed to protect the wearer, which means certain high-risk individuals, such as the 7 million people in the United States considered to be immunocompromised, can take comfort in knowing they can still protect themselves by wearing a mask.

"'We know that masks, worn correctly, with the right material, offer protection. It reduces the risks of viral particle transmissions,' said Dr. Jenny Yu, head of medical affairs at Healthline Media. 'We shouldn't take the all-or-none approach as there are still people who would benefit from the extra protection despite the numbers being low overall.'

"Although that 7 million represents less than 3% of the total US population, the decision of whether to wear a mask remains a constant consideration for this group -- as well as others, such as individuals over age 65, pregnant women and children under age 5, the latter of which are not yet eligible to get vaccinated" (https://thepointsguy.com/news/why-i-plan-to-wear-masks-on-planes/).

I, personally, will continue to wear my mask in enclosed crowded spaces. This is not only to protect myself, but also to protect others should I be unknowingly asymptomatic. It is our responsibility to our communities to maintain a high level of diligence when cases are continuing to rise in many locations. - Mod.LK]

[2] Prone position for patients

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/04/study-suggests-worse-outcomes-awake-covid-patients-prone-position


A nonrandomized controlled trial yesterday [18 Apr 2022] in JAMA Internal Medicine shows worse outcomes for hospitalized COVID-19 patients with low oxygen levels placed in the prone (chest-down) position while awake, although a commentary cautions about study design shortcomings (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2791385).

Led by Vanderbilt University researchers, the study assessed the clinical outcomes of 501 COVID-19 patients with hypoxemia (low oxygen levels) not on mechanical ventilation who were placed in the prone position at 2 academic medical centers from 13 May 2020 to 11 Dec 2020. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either prone positioning (intervention group) or usual care (control group). Average patient age was 61.0 years, 56.7% were women, and 83.2% were of non-Hispanic races.

Baseline illness severity was similar between the intervention and usual-care groups, with 65.9% vs 66.7%, respectively, receiving oxygen through a low-flow nasal cannula, 27.5% vs 25.5% receiving oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula, and 6.2% vs 7.8% on noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Per nurse observations, intervention patients spent a median of 4.2 hours a day in the prone position.

On day 5, the odds of the prone-positioned patients having worse outcomes than controls on the modified World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal outcome scale was 0.998 (posterior median adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.63; 95% credibility interval [CrI], 1.16 to 2.31). But on days 14 and 28, the odds of harm were 0.874 (aOR, 1.29; 95% CrI, 0.84 to 1.99) and 0.673 (aOR, 1.12; 95% CrI, 0.67 to 1.86), respectively.

By day 5, 7.4% of the intervention group and 3.7% of the control group had died, rising to 20.2% and 15.6%, respectively, by day 14. By day 28, when data were available for only 461 patients from one study site, 56 of 239 (23.4%) of those in the intervention group and 47 of 222 (21.2%) in the control group had died.

The intervention group needed higher concentrations of supplemental oxygen than controls on study days 1 through 5 (e.g., day 1 average, 45.32% vs 40.36%; day 5 average, 40.59% vs 37.10%). Over days 2 to 5, the probability of needing more oxygen in the intervention group increased (e.g., day 2 aOR, 1.06; day 3 aOR, 1.22; day 4 aOR, 1.39).

There was no difference in the number of either ventilator-free days (median, 28.0 days in both groups) or patients progressing to need mechanical ventilation (30 control patients [12.3%] vs 31 intervention patients [12.0%]).

Current guidelines recommend prone positioning for awake COVID-19 patients with the aim of preventing progression to mechanical ventilation and increasing survival. But the study authors noted that prone positioning, which has been used to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) since the 1970s, may raise oxygen levels without improving outcomes because oxygenation is not maintained on return to the face-up position.

"In this nonrandomized controlled trial, prone positioning offered no observed clinical benefit among patients with COVID-19-associated hypoxemia who had not received mechanical ventilation," they wrote. "Moreover, there was substantial evidence of worsened clinical outcomes at study day 5 among patients recommended to receive the awake prone positioning intervention, suggesting potential harm."

A possible explanation for these findings may be that prone positioning early after COVID-19 diagnosis may accelerate the progression of lung damage, which the researchers said is supported by the increasing probability of needing more oxygen from days 2 to 5 in intervention patients. "Adoption of early prone positioning may improve oxygenation but obscure the natural progression of disease, causing practitioners to potentially delay life-saving therapies or diagnostic testing," they wrote.

Although an unlikely explanation, the authors said the process of changing position can disrupt oxygen delivery, leading to lower oxygen levels and, perhaps, urgent intubation. "Although these events were not systematically collected, the steadily worsening oxygenation observed in the intervention group does not support this potential explanation," they wrote.

In a commentary in the same journal, Peter Sottile, MD, Richard Albert, MD, and Marc Moss, MD, all of the University of Colorado at Aurora, said the study findings are provocative but added that the authors' conclusions were diluted by a nonuniform patient population and the relatively short time patients were kept in the prone position (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2791388).

"If prone positioning is associated with improved mortality by reducing VILI [ventilator-induced lung injury] in patients with moderate to severe ARDS who are in the prone position for more than 16 hours per day, we would expect that the use of prone positioning for shorter periods among patients with less severe disease would be associated with improved short-term oxygenation," they wrote.

"However, the results of Qian et al suggest caution is warranted when extrapolating evidence-based interventions to different patient populations," Sottile and colleagues wrote. "As the Washington Post's Pulitzer-prize winning columnist Michael Dirda stated, 'science fiction is after all the art of extrapolation.'"

[3] CIDRAP news
[A] COVID and maintenance drugs
Date: Tue 19 Apr 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/04/covid-19-scan-apr-19-2022


Use of the common maintenance drugs angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), warfarin, statins, direct-factor Xa inhibitors, and P2Y12 inhibitors was tied to lower risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death, a large US National Institutes of Health (NIH) study suggests (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266922).

The observational study, published yesterday [18 Apr 2022] in PLOS One, identified COVID-19 patients using prescription claims data on a 20% random sample of Americans enrolled in Medicare Part D from 1 Apr 2020 to 31 Dec 2020. The patients were matched in a 1:5 ratio with uninfected controls based on age, race, sex, dual-eligibility status, and geographic region.

During the study period, 374 229 Medicare patients older than 65 years tested positive for COVID-19, and 278 912 (74.6%) of them were taking at least one study drug. The 3 most common such drugs were statins (50.1%), ACEIs (26.2%), and ARBs (22.3%).

Use of ACEIs (to lower blood pressure), ARBs (to lower blood pressure and treat heart failure), statins (to lower cholesterol), and the anticoagulants warfarin, direct-factor Xa inhibitors, and P2Y12 inhibitors were linked to a lower risk of COVID-19 infection, with risk reductions ranging from 1% for direct-factor Xa inhibitors to 12% for warfarin.

The heartburn preventive famotidine was associated with a 12% increased risk of infection, and the antimalaria drug hydroxychloroquine was tied to a 63% increased risk but had no effect after censoring for patients who recently started the drug. Hydroxychloroquine has been repeatedly disproven as a COVID-19 treatment.

Among COVID-19 patients, 39.6% were hospitalized. Use of ACEIs, ARBs, statins, warfarin, direct-factor Xa inhibitors, P2Y12 inhibitors, and famotidine were linked to a 2% to 11% decreased risk of hospitalization relative to never-users. After censoring, hydroxychloroquine showed no effect.

Overall, 17.2% of COVID-19 patients died. Use of ACEIs, ARBs, statins, warfarin, direct-factor Xa inhibitors, and P2Y12 inhibitors in this group was associated with reduced risk of death, ranging from 6% for P2Y12 inhibitors to 20% for direct-factor Xa inhibitors.

"One possible explanation is that if these drugs blunted the effects of COVID-19 infection, infected patients might have milder symptoms and would be more likely to not seek medical care and remain undiagnosed," the study authors wrote.

[B] Booster side effects
Date: Tue 19 Apr 2022

A study based on the 1st recipients of a 3rd (booster) Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose in Israel had only mild side effects, with only 11% of recipients reporting their side effects were worse than those experienced after the 1st or 2nd doses. The findings were published yesterday [18 Apr 2022] in JAMA Network Open (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2791203).

The study was based on the survey responses of 27 046 members of Clalit Health Services, which insures more than half of the Israeli population. The participants were all 60 or older and received a 3rd dose of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine from 30 Jul 2021 to 3 Aug 2021. Two surveys were conducted to gauge adverse effects (AEs) within one month of the 3rd dose.

The median age of respondents was 71, and 49.2% had at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19. A total of 30% of respondents reported at least one AE, and 24.8% reported an injection-site reaction. Pain at the injection site was the most common AE, followed by fatigue (9.7%) and malaise (7.2%).

Most of the respondents (67.8%) said after the 3rd dose they felt similar to how they felt after their 2nd dose, with 18.7% saying AEs were milder and 11.1% saying they were worse. A total of 1.2% of respondents sought medical attention because of booster-dose AEs.

Women and younger recipients were more likely to report systemic AEs, a pattern also seen in Israeli studies on 2nd-dose AEs.

"We found that AEs after the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine booster dose were generally mild and usually did not require medical care," the authors concluded. "The proportion of self-reported AEs that occurred in our study was similar or lower than that after the administration of the 2nd vaccine dose in several previous studies."
