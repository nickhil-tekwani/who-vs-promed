1st isolation of Asian fungus in Brazil soybean harvest
-----------------------------------------------
The Asian soybean rust [SR] fungus was detected for the 1st time in the
commercial cycle of 2004/2005 (Oct/Sep) of Brazilian soybeans, according to
a statement on 22 Nov 2004 by the Brazilian Company of Agricultural
Investigation (Embrapa). The outbreak appeared in the municipality of Tres
Barras, in Parana state. The soybean crop was planted in Sep 2004.
Previous detection of SR in Brazil had occurred in research areas or in
volunteer soybean plants that germinated spontaneously from grains that
fell to the ground during the last harvest.

[The fact that soybeans infected with soybean rust fungus (_Phakopsora
pachyrhizi_) have entered the commercial trade in Brazil means that control
of SR will become a higher priority in managing the disease. There is no
durable resistance to SR. Producers in Brazil will have to increase the
applications of chemical fungicides so as to reduce SR inoculum. Assuming
that they are registered for use in Brazil, chlorothalonil and azoxystrobin
based fungicides are recommended.
Chlorothalonil based fungicides have provided fair to good rust control in
dry beans when applied before infection. Preventative treatment will be
critical once SR is actually present. Azoxystrobin based fungicides are in
the relatively new strobilurins and are environmentally safer, according to
results of foreign trials. Unfortunately, the strobilurins are a single,
specific mode of action, so resistance management is a big concern if they
are overused or misused. Triazoles will be very important in protecting the
strobilurins from rust resistance. Resistance to azoxystrobin has been
reported in the United States from 3 powdery mildew isolates.
