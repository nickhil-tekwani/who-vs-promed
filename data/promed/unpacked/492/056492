The health commission of southwest China's Chongqing Municipality said Friday [16 Sep 2022] that it has found an imported case of monkeypox.

The case is an inbound traveler who transferred to Chongqing from abroad. The case developed symptoms, including a rash, during quarantine.

A laboratory test was conducted and the results showed positive for the monkeypox virus nucleic acid. Experts diagnosed the case as a confirmed case of monkeypox.

The patient is currently under quarantine and receiving treatment at a designated hospital, and is in a stable condition. All the close contacts have been placed under medical observation.

[5] USA: decline in cases

U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky said on Thursday [15 Sep 2022] she was cautiously optimistic over a decline in the growth of new monkeypox cases, but that some areas of the country are still experiencing a rise in infections.

She also said during a White House briefing that the agency was taking steps to address racial and ethnic disparities in distribution of monkeypox vaccines.

Nearly 23 000 cases of monkeypox have been identified across the United States as of [14 Sep 2022], Walensky told reporters.

"Over the last several weeks, we've been pleased to see a decline in the growth of new cases here and abroad. There are areas of the U.S. where the rate of rise in new cases is still increasing," she said. "We approach this news with cautious optimism."

The racial and ethnic makeup of the outbreak has evolved over the past few weeks, Walensky said.

CDC is opening applications for a vaccine equity pilot program under which 50 000 doses of Bavarian Nordic's Jynneos vaccine have been allocated to address distribution disparities.

"While monkeypox cases were first seen predominantly in non-Hispanic white men, in the last week among the cases for which we have race and ethnicity data, non-Hispanic Black men represented 38% of cases, Latino or Hispanic men represented 25% of cases and non-Hispanic white men represented 26%," Walensky said.

Conversely, of the 91% of 1st vaccine doses administered for which the CDC has race and ethnicity data, white people received about 47% of those shots, Hispanic people got about 20% and Black people accounted for some 12%, the CDC director noted.

"The percentage of vaccines administered to Latino or Hispanic men and non-Hispanic Black men are disproportionately lower than we are seeing represented in cases," she acknowledged.

More than 540 000 doses of monkeypox vaccine have been administered so far, Walensky said. CDC data shows that 80% of those were 1st doses, but the number of 2nd doses administered has increased over the past several weeks, Walensky said.

Jynneos needs to be given in 2 doses, 4 weeks apart, to be fully effective. At a briefing on [26 Aug 2022], Walensky said 97% of shots administered had been 1st doses.

[6] USA: low risk, healthcare workers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
Although risk for monkeypox transmission to health care personnel (HCP) is thought to be low, CDC recommends that HCP wear personal protective equipment (PPE) consisting of gown, gloves, eye protection, and an N95 (or higher-level) respirator while caring for patients with suspected or confirmed monkeypox.

What is added by this report?
Among 313 Colorado HCP exposed to patients with monkeypox, recommended PPE use and receipt of postexposure prophylaxis vaccination was low. HCP were assessed for risk and actively monitored for 21 days when indicated; none acquired monkeypox.

What are the implications for public health practice?
The risk for acquiring monkeypox among U.S. HCP after exposure to patients with monkeypox is very low. HCP in all health care settings can benefit from public health outreach regarding infection prevention education and training.
