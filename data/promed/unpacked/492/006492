A 9-member team of the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad on Tuesday [8 Dec 2020] collected samples of water, milk, rice, vegetables, along with the blood and urine sample of patients after a massive number of people fell sick due to unknown disease in Eluru town of Andhra Pradesh.

"They have collected blood and urine samples of patients from hospitals. Later they went to places in town where the cases have been developed. The team collected samples of water, milk, rice, and vegetables," said NIN scientist and team leader JJ Babu.

"The team will leave for Hyderabad tonight and will analyse the samples at NIN Hyderabad tomorrow. Preliminary reports may come by Friday or Saturday, final analysis reports will take a max of 10 days' time. If needed, the samples will be sent to Ahmadabad also," said JJ Babu.

"Heavy metals or organochlorine is suspected to be a reason but this cannot be confirmed immediately," said the NIN scientist Dr Sinha.

"The number of cases that are reported are gradually coming down. In the morning it was 123 now it is 77. The remaining cases on the bed at this point in time are 77 and we feel another 20 cases may be discharged by morning. So gradually the panic in the public is coming down. The incidents of cases are also coming down. And the severity of symptoms are also coming down," Dr Mohan told media on Tuesday [8 Dec 2020].

A report released by the West Godavari district collector on Monday [7 Dec 2020] said one person has died due to the unknown disease. Besides, a household health survey has been conducted in 57 863 houses to shed light on the matter, said the report.

[In other updates, they have focused on organochlorines from mosquito spraying, and have found some heavy metal exposure in some individuals.

I have never heard of mass hysteria involving either organochlorines or heavy metals. Nor am I aware of true heavy metal exposure cases improving so rapidly. While some chemical cases may improve rapidly, the oddity comes in how quickly so many victims occurred and likewise how they seem to be resolving almost as fast.

When I consider the rapid symptoms and the rapid recovery, I am concerned the actual culprit of these has not yet been identified. I am quite glad so many are recovering so quickly.

While something certainly affected these people, the question remains of what was it. Hopefully, definitive answers will become apparent.

The rapid response from healthcare workers and others is to be applauded. We look forward to the results of the investigation to determine the cause. - Mod.TG]
