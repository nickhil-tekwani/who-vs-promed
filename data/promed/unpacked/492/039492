[Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases is increasing.

According to the last FAO update dated 25 Aug 2021: "To date, 41 human cases of influenza A(H5N6) have been reported, 40 occurring in China and one in Lao People's Democratic Republic" (http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/Global_AIV_Zoonotic_Update/situation_update.html). Including the case from the above report, it makes a total of 42 cases to date (9 Sep 2021).

According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia. - Mod.UBA
