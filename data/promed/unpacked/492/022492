Dozens of students fall ill in mumps outbreak
---------------------------------------------
The Health Protection Agency has been called in after dozens of students at
the University of Chichester were struck down with mumps. A total of 66
students were identified as having the symptoms and those infected have
been sent home to recover.

John Gallally, head of student support services, said: "The university has
taken the suspected outbreak very seriously and immediately sought expert
guidance from the Health Protection Agency. We have been working very
closely with the agency. They have visited the campus and are satisfied
with the precautions being carried out. We have been advised to carry on
our business as normal. We have student health advisers on both campuses to
advise on a daily basis and anyone showing the symptoms has been told to
stay at home for at least 5 days."

[Outbreaks of mumps continue to occur among young adults attending further
education colleges and universities in the United Kingdom as a consequence
in part of to the less than optimal acceptance of the triple mumps,
measles, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and in part to the lesser
immunogenicity of the mumps virus component of the triple vaccine.

The 2 campuses of the University of Chichester are located on the south
coast of England in the adjacent tows and Chichester and Bognor Regis which
can be located using the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of the
