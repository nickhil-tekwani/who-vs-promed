The Veterinary Department in the central province of Quang Tri yesterday [18 Feb 2016] reported that cases of foot-and-mouth disease were on the rise and could become widespread.

Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has appeared in Gio Linh, Trieu Phong, and Cam Lo Districts, with a total of 49 cases reported in 16 local households.

The cattle were infected with the disease during the Lunar New Year [8 Feb 2016] celebrations, when timely prevention and treatment measures were not available, the department said.

The cold and wet weather have also contributed to the spread of the disease, it added.

To deal with the situation, the veterinary and agriculture and rural development departments of the province have announced the outbreak and prohibited the sale and transport of cattle in the affected areas.

The departments' officials also guided cattle breeders on treatment for their infected cattle and supplied chemicals for them to spray in the breeding areas.

The People's Committee in Gio Linh and Trieu Phong districts supplied 4000 doses of a vaccine for cattle to curtail the spread of the disease.

Head of the veterinary department Le Thi Nga said the risk of an outbreak of the disease was high because most of the cattle in the province had not been vaccinated since September [2015] due to the lack of vaccines.

Currently, the province needs some 60 000-65 000 doses of the vaccine for the cattle, she said.

The department has asked the provincial People's Committee to fund the purchase of 30 000 doses to supply the areas at greatest risk of infection as well as the affected areas, she said.

According to the "Socialist Republic of Viet Nam" page in the World Reference Laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD) website, Viet Nam's current FMD status is "endemic", with 3 serotypes identified since 1999: serotype 'O' (last recorded in 2015), 'A' (last recorded 2015), and 'Asia 1' (last recorded 2009).

Samples for serotyping and genotyping have been submitted from Viet Nam to the WRLFMD each year since 2009. During 2015, 2 serotypes, were identified as follows:
FMD-O: topotype SEA, lineage Mya-98 (in 2014, genotype ME-SA PanAsia was identified as well).
FMD-A: topotype ASIA, lineage Sea-97.

Another commendable/useful website is the SEAFMD (Southeast Asia Foot and Mouth Disease) Campaign page (http://www.seafmd-rcu.oie.int/), where monthly reports from each of the 8 countries (including Viet Nam) participating in OIE's regional coordinating Unit SEAFMD, are available. The 2015 data, including outbreaks which started in the previous year and were ongoing, are the following (in parentheses, 2014 data): accumulated number of outbreaks (all serotypes) 79 (63); serotype O - 31 (28); serotype A - 11 (18); serotype Asia 1 (new outbreaks) - 0 (0). Not sampled - 21 (23). - Mod.AS
