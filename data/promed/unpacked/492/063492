RSV activity starting to increase in England and Wales
------------------------------------------------------
As conveyed in the Public Health England influenza report this week, levels of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity are beginning to increase, as expected for this time of year. Passive immunisation with monoclonal antibodies (palivizumab) are therefore now indicated for the prevention of RSV in at-risk children.

RSV activity typically occurs in the UK within the period from October to March each year with most infections occurring in a relatively short epidemic of about 6 weeks. Peak numbers of RSV infections are reported in December and January every winter, although the size of the peak varies from winter to winter. Further information is available online (http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/RespiratorySyncytialVirus/). RSV is the most common cause of severe respiratory illness (such as bronchiolitis, inflammation of the bronchioles) in young children (aged under 2 years). However, repeat infection throughout life is common and it causes significant morbidity and mortality in the elderly population.

Clinicians should now be considering the monthly administration of prophylactic palivizumab which is licensed for use in young children at risk of severe bronchiolitis. This includes children under 2 years of age with chronic lung disease with oxygen dependency and infants under 6 months of age with severe congenital heart disease. Further information is available from the RSV chapter (27a) in the immunisation against infectious disease green book (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/respiratory-syncytial-virus-the-green-book-chapter-27a).

[Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is highly communicable, but humans are the only known reservoir. The incubation period varies from 2 to 8 days. The virus is spread from respiratory secretions through close contact with infected persons via respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. By 2 years of age, nearly all children have been infected by RSV at least once. Previous infection by RSV may confer only partial immunity to RSV and so individuals may be infected repeatedly with the same or different strains of RSV.

Predisposing factors for RSV infection include prematurity, cardiopulmonary disease, and immunodeficiency, and may also include other factors such as tobacco exposure, day care attendance, overcrowding, lack of breastfeeding, and admission to hospital during the RSV season. Epidemics in care homes for elderly people have been common in some years.

Two major subtypes (A and B) have been identified based on structural variations in the G protein, and an increasing number of distinct genotypes are in circulation. The predominance of a subtype changes over successive seasons but so far has not been associated with disease severity. - Mod.CP
