In a dark and muddy alley in the Nile Delta town of Damietta, where
Egypt's latest fatal bird flu victim lived [see: Avian influenza,
human (03): Egypt, Pakistan, WHO 20080104.0038], inhabitants fear the
authorities more than the virus. "It was the will of God that she
died. The chickens had nothing to do with it," says Husseini Ahmed
Amine, 54, a furniture maker who employs a son of the dead woman, who
was aged 50. Most of the inhabitants of the Ezbet el-Lahm district
pay scant attention to the government's campaign against the H5N1
virus, which, after a summer respite, killed 4 people, all women, in
the space of a week over New Year.
Health Minister Hatem al-Gabali warned in December [2007] against
"slackness in the preventive measures taken to fight bird flu,
especially as winter approaches." But here, as elsewhere in the
country, distrust of the government is widespread. A national
campaign to slaughter possibly infected birds is more often than not
seen as just another threat from authorities in which people have no faith.
The woman's death was the 19th fatality in Egypt, where there has
been a total of 43 cases of bird flu in humans since the disease was
1st recorded here in February 2006. Women and children have borne the
brunt of the virus because of their role in taking care of domestic
fowl. "Listen to me: all these chickens, they don't kill them, they
sell them off or eat them," says Hanane Essayyed Farhat, 42, a mother
of 4 selling her poultry a few dozen metres (yards) from the latest
victim's home. "The state and businessmen profit from bird flu. It's
all just about trying to get people to buy frozen chickens. That way
they'll make money off our back," she adds.
The authorities recommend eating factory farmed chicken, whose
origins can be traced. Almost 2 years since H5N1 appeared in Egypt,
the north African country has become one of the most affected
countries in the world. But despite a government ban on raising
poultry on rooftops -- an age-old tradition in Egypt -- chicken,
ducks and geese continue to squawk and quack from cages on most of
this district's rooftops, alongside a multitude of pigeon coops.
According to the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation, Egypt and
Indonesia are the countries most likely to see the virus mutate into
a form that is contagious among humans, because of people's close
contact with poultry. It is a challenge to get people to stop raising
and eating poultry in a country where meat is a luxury for most, and
birds can be fed cheaply on food leftovers. "I don't believe in bird
flu. We look after our poultry; nothing can happen to them," says
Amine. "What's more, their factory chicken has no taste; you can't
even tell it's chicken." Many of those infected are fearful of
revealing their symptoms, as they would lose a source of revenue, and
they fear the anger of their neighbours throughout the village who
may have their flocks slaughtered. As a result, many sufferers are
often hospitalized too late for the medical treatment to work.
The Health Ministry recently called for heightened vigilance, saying
that preventative measures were not being implemented against the
disease because of "a conviction that the virus has gone." According
to the World Organisation for Animal Health, the highly infectious
strain of the H5N1 avian flu virus can be eradicated if it is dealt
with effectively in Egypt, Indonesia and Nigeria, where it has become endemic.

[2] Egypt -15 new suspected cases
Date: Sun 13 Jan 2008

<http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=76207>

15 new suspected cases of the deadly H5N1 strain of the avian flu
virus were reported last week in 5 governorates in Egypt, as
government measures to strengthen national pandemic preparedness
provoked mixed reactions in Cairo's streets. According to local
media, the latest cases were detected in Qena, Al-Buheira, Al-
Gharbia, Al-Minya and Al-Sohag. The patients were admitted to
hospital for treatment and surveillance after suffering high
temperatures and breathing problems. In response, the government's
Supreme National Committee for Combating Bird Flu met last week to
discuss the current outbreak and to implement measures to combat the
spread of bird flu.
Amr Kandeel, an official in the Ministry of Health's communicable
diseases department, told IRIN that the bird flu committee is
focusing on 5 measures to curb the spread of the virus: active
surveillance; public awareness campaigns; support of public health
teams in hospitals; stockpiling of the flu treatment drug Tamiflu,
antiviral medications and vaccination equipment; and the setting up
of a telephone hotline to answer public enquiries.
In addition, Kandeel said the Ministry of Agriculture had banned the
sale of live birds in Cairo's markets. "Poultry sellers who do not
abide by the protection measures will face forced closure of their
shops," he said in a phone interview.
While empty bird cages in many of Cairo's poultry shops reflect the
efficiency of the government crackdown, many in the poultry business
said they would ignore the ban as they felt the government was
over-reacting. One poultry seller in Old Cairo's Khan El-Khalili
market, who refused to reveal his name fearing arrest, said he would
continue to sell live chicken covertly. Another poultry seller, was
critical of the government's anti-bird flu initiatives. "I have heard
about bird flu, it's famous nowadays," he said. "But there is nothing
here; this disease comes from outside [the country]. I am not scared
because our chicken is good and healthy, but the government wants to
scare us. Chicken is the cornerstone of our economy; it's cheap and
nourishes our families."
Poultry is the main source of food and income for about 5 million
households across Egypt. As such, a large number of people keep and
raise domestic poultry, making it difficult to eradicate bird flu
completely, the government says.
Two weeks ago, the bird flu committee banned domestic poultry raising
altogether and oversaw the culling of all poultry infected with the
bird flu virus. It also reinforced an existing ban on transporting
poultry from one governorate to another without official inspection
and clearance. "There is no danger that bird flu could hurt my
business," The manager of the Midan Hussein branch of the Gad
restaurant chain, said while watching one of his employees scrape
chicken meat off a grill to make a shawarma sandwich for a customer.
"My customers are not scared. I buy my chicken from the big farms in
the countryside where hygiene standards and medical controls are better."
Since the H5N1 strain of bird flu was 1st detected in Egypt in
February 2006, the country has had the largest number of human bird
flu cases outside the Asian continent. Four deaths at the turn of
this year [2007-2008] brought the number of fatalities caused by bird
flu in Egypt to 19.

[These 2 reports highlight both the commendable response of the
Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population to the resurgence of H5N1
avian influenza with the deaths of 4 women at the turn of the year
and the daunting task of obtaining an appropriate response from the
population at large. If any of the 15 suspected cases now in hospital
are confirmed as H5N1 cases, it may dispel some of the prevailing
complacency and ignorance and stimulate greater cooperation with the
healthcare authorities in Egypt. - Mod.CP]
