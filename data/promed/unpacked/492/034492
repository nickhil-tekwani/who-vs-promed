Ibiza has been plagued with an invasion of Asian tiger mosquitoes -- 4 times bigger than normal -- as swimming pools in the vacation hotspot are left untreated during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new report.

The critters -- which carry diseases like Zika virus, West Nile virus and dengue fever -- have likely thrived since the closure of hotels and holiday villas on the Spanish island, The Sun reported. [The vector of West Nile virus are in the genus _Culex_. - Mod.TY]

The bugs, which prefer moist air, have been attracted to the swimming pools left untended due to the lack of tourists, according to the report.

The mosquitoes take 10 to 12 days to hatch -- and when they do, they tend to emerge during the day, when humans are out and about, not just dawn and dusk, The Sun reported. They are able to bite through clothing, according to the report.

All tourism has been prohibited in Ibiza during the coronavirus outbreak, leaving the usual tourist hotspots deserted.

Now, the department for environmental management in Ibiza's council has warned residents to keep their pools purified, warning that not doing so could create a "real public health problem," The Sun reported.

Meanwhile, Ibiza is beginning to soften its lockdown, the outlet reported. "We have been able to advance quickly because we have moved forward with things done well," said Francina Armegol, head of the Balearic government. "And we have to carry on doing this responsibly."

Spain, one of the countries most heavily hit by the pandemic, will allow tourism to resume in July [2020], according to the report.

"Foreign tourists can start planning their holidays," Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said over the weekend. "We guarantee that tourists will not be at risk and that they will not put us at risk."

[The occurrence of the Asian tiger mosquito (_Aedes albopictus_) in Ibiza of the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea, is not surprising. This mosquito is established along the southern coast of Spain to Gibraltar (see the map of its European distribution as of June 2018 at https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/aedes-albopictus-current-known-distribution-june-2018).

Not mentioned above is chikungunya virus, which this mosquito can transmit efficiently and has been responsible for outbreaks of this virus in Italy in the past. - Mod.TY
