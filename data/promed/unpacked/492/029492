Italian and Hungarian researchers report the discovery of a novel parvovirus species (_Protoparvovirus_ genus) related genetically to human bufaviruses in young dogs with respiratory signs (canine respiratory infectious disease, CIRD).

The canine bufavirus (CBuV) was distantly related to the well-known canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) (Protoparvovirus), currently regarded to as a major canine pathogen. CBuV and CPV-2 share low amino acid identities in the non-structural protein NS1 (40.6 percent) and in the capsid protein VP1 (33.4 percent). By screening collections of fecal and nasal/oropharyngeal samples obtained from young or juvenile dogs (less than one year of age), CBuV DNA appeared as a common component of the canine virome. The virus was common in the stool of dogs with or without enteric disease and in the nasal and oropharyngeal swabs of dogs with respiratory symptoms, whilst it was not detected in nasal and oropharyngeal swabs of asymptomatic animals.

[The paper to which the above account refers is detailed in the reference below.

The described research initially addressed an outbreak in 2011 of canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) in a litter of 3 mixed-breed 5-month-old puppies in Italy. The animals' clinical signs were nasal discharge, coughing, and respiratory distress, but they completely recovered from the disease after 2 weeks. Nasal and oropharyngeal (NOP) swab specimens tested negative to a panel of molecular assays for CIRD-associated common and emerging viral agents: canine adenovirus (CAV) types 1 and 2, canine distemper virus, canid herpesvirus 1 (CHV-1), canine respiratory coronavirus, influenza virus, canine parainfluenza virus, canine pneumovirus, nonprimate canine hepacivirus, _B. bronchiseptica_, _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies zooepidemicus, and _Mycoplasma cynos_. Because the etiology of the outbreak was unknown, the case was considered eligible for metagenomic investigation, which was undertaken.

In addition, respiratory (nasal and oropharyngeal) samples from young dogs with CIRD (collected from 2011-2015) and enteric (stool and rectal) swabs from pups and young dogs (collected from 2010-2015) were added to the investigated material.

The following excerpts from the paper's discussion chapter may be of interest to subscribers (references deleted; available in source URL):

"We report the detection and genomic characterization of CBuV, a novel canine protoparvovirus, from a small outbreak of CIRD. In the NS1 gene, CBuV displayed low nt (24.1-69.4 percent) and aa (19.3-51.4 percent) identities compared with other protoparvoviruses. Current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses criteria for classification of parvoviruses into the same species require (higher than) 85 percent identity in the NS1 protein; on this basis, CBuV could be classified as a new parvovirus species. The closest relatives to CBuV were protoparvoviruses identified in primates and other mammals, commonly termed bufaviruses. Bufaviruses were 1st identified in 2012 in Burkina Faso in fecal samples from a child with enteric signs. Similar bufaviruses have been subsequently identified in different species of domestic and wild animals.

"A small case-control study on samples of enteric and respiratory origin in puppies and young dogs revealed that CBuV appeared significantly more common in NOP swab samples from dogs with acute CIRD. With certain exceptions, it has been difficult to demonstrate a clear association of many potential pathogens with CIRD in either epidemiologic studies or experimental infections.

"CIRD or kennel cough has a multiagent etiology, with more than one agent (viruses or bacteria) involved sequentially or synergistically to cause disease. Pathogens commonly associated with CIRD include CAV-2, canine parainfluenza virus, and _Bordetella bronchiseptica_. Less commonly, CHV-1 can cause respiratory disease. CAV-1 and canine distemper virus infections are also associated with respiratory disease but are usually responsible for systemic disease.

"In recent years, other emerging agents have been associated with CIRD, including canine respiratory coronavirus, canine pneumovirus, nonprimate canine hepaciviru, CBoVs, _Mycoplasma cynos_, and _Streptococcus equi_ subsp. zooepidemicus. In addition, thus far, more than 5 strains of influenza virus have been identified in dogs: the equine-derived H3N8 virus, the human-derived H1N1 virus, and the avian-like H3N2, H3N1, and H5N2 viruses.

"In conclusion, the advancement of techniques available for pathogen discovery is quickly broadening the list of potential canine infectious agents. Understanding in more depth the effects of those agents on canine health will be pivotal to implementing future strategies for prophylaxis, chiefly for complex diseases like CIRD.

"With certain exceptions, it has been difficult to demonstrate a clear association of many potential pathogens with CIRD in either epidemiologic studies or experimental infections. Our study could not provide conclusive evidence for a role of this novel virus in CIRD."
