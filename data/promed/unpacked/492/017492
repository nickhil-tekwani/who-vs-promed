TRYPANOSOMIASIS - AFRICA (4)
==============================
Please allow me to clarify my use of a word. I was in no way defending the
infensible treatment of Africa and Africans by European and other western
countries. I do not consider Africans "victims". What I had suggested was
that the overblown use of the word "hostage" does no one any good. People
anywhere who are infected with anything are victims of their societies and of
the world society at large. No matter the descriptor, they are no less ill.
However, the word "hostage" reminds me of Patty Heart, "Dog Day Afternoon",
and U.S. Embassy employees in Iran.
It was the word I objected to, not the intent (I hope).
Charlie Calisher
