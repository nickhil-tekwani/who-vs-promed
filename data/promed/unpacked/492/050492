I ran these cases through the diagnosis/simulation module of GIDEON.
Assuming an infectious etiology, the constellation of coma, fever and
vomiting is rather non-specific for a country like Democratic Republic of
Congo. Additional data (rash? thrombocytopenia? conjunctivitis?
lymphadenopathy? arthritis? animal contact?, etc) would be most helpful.
Among the diseases listed by GIDEON are hemorrhagic fevers (Ebola, Marburg,
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, yellow fever - the latter last reported in
this country in 1972), bacterial septicemia, malaria, anthrax and Reye's
syndrome (interesting possibility, given that the patient received
aspirin). Shigellosis is also listed, and might conceivably have been
worsened by adminstration of Papaverine. One might also consider an
unusual reaction to chloramphenicol - the dosage and preparations used
should be reviewed.
