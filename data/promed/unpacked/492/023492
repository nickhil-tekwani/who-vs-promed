Anthrax outbreak reported in Armenia
------------------------------------
An outbreak of anthrax ("Siberian ulcer") has been detected in the
Shirakskaya province of Armenia. The Ministry of Agriculture of Armenia
indicated that the center of infection was the village of Aigabats, where
40 cattle have died of anthrax. Dogs that were fed the dead animals' meat
also died. Meat from the outbreak area was sold in the markets of a town in
the same oblast 2 days before the mass death of the cattle. People known to
have been exposed to potentially infected meat were being tested for
anthrax. The use of low-quality domestic (Armenian) anthrax vaccines is
cited as the cause of the current outbreak.

[This but repeats a constant story we are getting from this region of
ineffective control of this disease and official reaction after the event.
If it takes 40 dead cows to trigger a response, the occasional animal
anthrax death will go unobserved, much less unrecorded. From the prior
reports out of Armenia (see below), this is not an atypical event,
unfortunately. That the suspect meat was sold before "40 cattle ... died"
probably reflects an investigational and reporting delay more than the true
chronological order of events. - Mod.MHJ]
