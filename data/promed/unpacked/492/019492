In a follow-up on the human Rift Valley fever (RVF) situation in the African country of Mauritania, the country's health ministry reported 4 additional human cases and one more fatality.

This brings the number of cases reported to 32 and 17 deaths caused by RVF.

Out of 145 total tests performed, in addition to the RVF cases, 2 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) were reported. One of the cases died from the viral infection.

Rift Valley Fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever that causes illness in animals (such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and camels).

Most people with RVF have either no symptoms or a mild illness with fever, weakness, back pain, and dizziness. A small percentage (8-10%) of people with RVF develop much more severe symptoms, including eye disease, hemorrhage (excessive bleeding), and encephalitis (swelling of the brain).

Most people recover within one week. Approximately 1% of people who get RVF die.

[Human cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) continue to increase from 12 deaths of 22 cases on 26 Sep 2022 (see Rift Valley fever - Mauritania (06): human, livestock 20220928.8705845) then to 17 deaths of 28 cases given in the 4 Oct 2022 report and now with 32 cases in the above report. The current number of confirmed livestock cases is not mentioned above but previously was reported as having reached 264 confirmed cases in 7 wilayas (see Rift Valley fever - Mauritania (07): human 20221004.87059632021). All affected animals are reported as camels. The number of human cases of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever remains low at 2.

People in the affected areas need to be aware of the risk of handling infected animals, including their slaughtering and processing, as well as fresh animal products (uncooked meat and crude milk). RVF virus can also be mosquito-transmitted. However, vector control over this large geographic area would be difficult. There is no vaccine available for humans. - Mod.TY
