Prairie dogs die of plague
------------------------------
Weld County health officials are asking people who visit or live
around Pawnee National Grasslands to look out for signs of plague after
finding the disease in 6 dead prairie dogs. A researcher observing prairie
dogs in the park found the infected colony at the northwest intersection
of Weld County roads 96 and 67, northwest of Briggsdale.
6 of the 8 dead prairie dogs handed over to the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention tested positive for bubonic plague. Officials think
the other 2 also have the disease, but more tests are needed, said Sara
Evans, consumer protection supervisor for the Weld County Department of
Public Health and Environment.
On average, 13 cases of plague in humans are reported in the USA each
year. Most occur in the southwestern states. Humans, and their pets, can
be infected when a prairie dog with the plague dies and the fleas look
for another host. "If a dog, cat, or human happens to be nearby, they
will hitch a ride and feed on them," Evans said.
The last known case of the plague infecting a person in Weld
County occurred a little more than 10 years ago, Evans said. Investigators
believe that a student at the University of Northern Colorado caught the
disease while playing baseball in a Fort Collins field where rodents were
present, she said.
Over the past few years, Weld county officials have suspected plague
when they have seen populations of prairie dogs die off in areas near
Fort Lupton, Hudson, and Pierce Evans said. However, without animals to
test, officials could not confirm that plague was responsible, she said.
Residents should watch rodent populations near their homes and report
any sudden die-offs to the health department, Evans said.

[Prairie dogs are very sensitive indicators of when the plague organism,
_Yersenia pestis_, is in an area. Prairie dogs are often considered
sentinel animals. Domestic cats are also sensitive to the plague agent. -
