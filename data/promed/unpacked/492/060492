FOOD SECURITY IN THE PACIFIC

I read with interest your comments (ref. above) about food security and
species diversity. You asked for input from readers about regional staples
not included in the list you presented.
Here in the 22 island nations which the South Pacific Commission
(SPC) caters for, taro (_Colocasia_) is the main staple. Other
varieties such as _Cyrtosperma_, _Alocasia_ and _Xanthosoma_ are
also very popular. The leaves are also eaten and are a very good
source of retinol, B1 and B12. Therefore, I think taro should be
included in the list.
Food imports such as white rice and white flour are gradually
replacing the local staples of taro, yams, breadfruit and sweet
potato because of their cheapness and convenience. This has been
associated with the transition from mainly subsistence to cash
economies. Simultaneously, with this transition there has been
an alarming increase in diet-related chronic diseases such as
diabetes, hypertension and heart disease that has seen some
Pacific nations disease rates rise to some of the highest
in the world. Coupled with this is an ever increasing
urbanisation, which in itself has created pockets of poverty
which never existed before.
Food security, both at the national and household level is
becoming one of the major issues for these countries. Most
countries are in a trade deficit in foodstuffs and therefore are
dependent on food imports. Many households do not have access to
a wide enough variety of nutritious foods to maintain health.
The traditional "food gardens" of the Pacific Islands still exist
and SPC are involved in projects with UNICEF and UNDP to promote
home gardens but they will always now be supplementary
to imported foods for most households and not the major source.
There are possibly many other crops that local people feel are
essential that could be lost forever unless they are collected
and documented. I am far from an expert in botany or
horticulture but feel that many people do not realise how
important these crops are for their independence per se.
