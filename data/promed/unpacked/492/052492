The first case of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome this year [2022] was confirmed in Herrera province. The patient is a 58 year old woman, a resident of the El Jazmin community in the Pese district.

The chief of public health of the Herrera health region, Stacy Osorio, confirmed that the patient is being treated in the intensive care unit of the Gustavo Nelson Collado Hospital in, Chitre. The patient's prognosis is reserved with an additional risk factor, which is close contact with a positive COVID-19 case. However, Osorio indicated that 2 tests were done for coronavirus infection, antigen and PCR, and both were negative.

After detecting the hantavirus [infection] case, the vector control teams went to the El Jazmin community and are carrying out an inspection in the area around the house [of the patient]. Through this inspection, it was possible to find multiple risk factors, including corn crops near the house and remains of branches and trees that could serve as breeding sites for the mouse vector.

The public health chief recommended that, given the dry season, one should carry out an effective cleaning of those spaces that were kept closed, using a mask, and also opening doors and windows for correct ventilation.

In 2021, in the Herrera province, just one case of hantavirus [infection] was confirmed, in the Parita district.

Hantavirus infections in Panama's central provinces, including Herrera, are common, and cases occur there every year.

An earlier WHO report indicates that Choclo is the hantavirus identified in those cases, based on genomic sequence analysis (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report cited above, or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done, confirms the ProMED conclusion that Choclo virus was involved.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and the adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection.

The report above does not provide a complete listing of the household measures that should be taken to prevent human exposure. A previous report stated that preventive measures recommended include the following:

- store grain in sacks and closed plastic containers, place them on pallets, and keep them separated from the walls;
- place firewood, lumber, or any other useful materials distant from the house, in an arid, dry area and on pallets;
- drain residual water from patios and keep them clean;
- keep the kitchen area clean and utensils in covered containers, to avoid that they come in contact with rodents;
- open doors and windows for 60 minutes before cleaning areas that have been closed for a long time;
- spray the floor with water [a 10% bleach solution is better] to avoid raising dust that may contain virus-contaminated excrement from infected rodents. - Mod.TY
