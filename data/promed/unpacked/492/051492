Latest total has already surpassed the 35 cases of measles logged over past year.

There were 9 more cases of measles since last week [week of 29 Aug 2016], bringing the total number of people with the virus to 41, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) announced on [Tue 6 Sep 2016].

Officials are investigating reports of several cases breaking out at a Justin Bieber concert held in Chiba Prefecture last month [August 2016] as well as among workers at Kansai International Airport, TV Asahi reports (6 Sep 2016).

The figure for the outbreak at the airport is expected to rise since numerous cases have yet to be reported to the health center, CBnews reported.

The latest total has already surpassed the 35 cases of measles logged in the last one-year period, local media reported.

By administrative district, Chiba Prefecture currently holds the highest number of cases at 12, followed by Tokyo and Hyogo Prefecture with 6 each, Saitama and Osaka Prefecture with 3 each, and Mie Prefecture with 2, according to CBnews.

Foreign strain D8
-----------------
The World Health Organization announced that Japan eradicated measles in March 2015 after a measles outbreak 7 years earlier infected more than 10 000 people.

Japan had met a WHO requirement which mandated that domestic cases be brought under control for over 3 years aside. Cases contracted overseas are excluded from the requirement.

But a foreign strain of measles known as D8 has seen Japan face a constant stream of imported measles cases since the start of this year [2016], with the strain accounting for 60 percent of domestic cases as of [Sun 4 Sep 2016], according to the NIID.

The Japanese Society for Infection Prevention and Control said that there could be more "measles outbreaks in various locations in the future," urging medical institutions to report cases to the NIID to receive advice on treatment and follow-up care.

If a doctor suspects an individual with rash or high fever has measles, the society is urging them to examine their vaccination and travel records and aim for an early diagnosis, as well as quarantine any infected patients and implement airborne infection control.

Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease. Symptoms usually develop 10 days after exposure.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is urging citizens to quickly seek medical attention if symptoms like high fever and a rash start to appear.

[Molecular epidemiology of measles viruses is an important component in outbreak investigations and for global surveillance of circulating wild-type measles strains. Measles virus genotyping can play an important role in tracking transmission pathways during outbreak investigations.

Wild-type measles viruses have been divided into distinct genetic groups, referred to as genotypes, based on the nucleotide sequences of their hemagglutinin (H) and nucleoprotein (N) genes, which are the most variable genes on the viral genome. The 450 nucleotides encoding the carboxy-terminal 150 amino acids of the nucleoprotein have up to 12 percent nucleotide variation between genotypes. The 450 nucleotides that encode the carboxy-terminal region of the nucleoprotein (N-450) are required for determination of the genotype. D8 is one of the genotypes that have been circulating.

At least 3 children have contracted measles in Safi tehsil [sub-district], Mohmand Agency [Federally Administered Tribal Areas] on [Tue 6 Sep 2016].

A health official has confirmed the development. "3 children of a resident of Shewa Farsh, Safi tehsil, have been afflicted with measles," he told The Express Tribune.

According to the official, another child was rushed to a hospital in Peshawar in critical condition after he contracted measles. The health official said there are no vaccines for measles at basic health units in Safi.

The agency's Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) Coordinator Dr Shabir Khan denied that any case has been reported to agency surgeon's office at Ghallanai.

"If measles cases are reported, [we] will dispatch a team to investigate," he said. According to Shabir, measles is a common ailment and campaigns are organised if reports are received about such cases.

Health and education infrastructure in Mohmand Agency had been dismantled by a crippling wave of militancy that has gripped the region in the past.

As a result, locals depend heavily on non-qualified medical technicians or schoolteachers who act as private medical practitioners in most parts of the agency. Earlier this year [2016], at least 4 children died of measles and pneumonia over a span of a week in Haleemzai, Mohmand Agency.

[Maps of Pakistan can be accessed at http://www.mapsofworld.com/pakistan/pakistan-political-map.html and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4473122,2202.
Mohmand Agency is a district in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan created in 1951. Mohmand is bounded by Bajaur Agency to the north, Khyber Agency to the south, Malakand and Charsadda districts to the east, and Peshawar district to the south east.
It is likely access to vaccination may be a problem.

A measles vaccination campaign in Pakistan relies on the dedication of local health workers, coordination of government authorities, and the support of international partners in order to provide life-saving immunizations to millions of children.

In late 2012, an outbreak of measles in southern Pakistan quickly spread to other parts of the country. The Government of Pakistan, along with partners including UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO), initiated a measles vaccination campaign targeting nearly 63.5 million children up to 10 years of age. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) stepped in to help and has since provided 37 million doses of measles vaccine, against the total requirement of 69.4 million doses -- one of the biggest measles campaigns ever supported by GAVI.

But getting viable vaccine to the tribal areas is difficult. The region is inaccessible, which makes it difficult for vaccination teams to move and for other humanitarian organizations to operate safely. - Mod.LK]
