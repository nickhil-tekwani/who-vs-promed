Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive; Contact with wild species

Epidemiological comments:
1. Outbreak in Krasnodarskiy Kray: The outbreak is in the buffer zone with vaccination against FMD. It is located 5 km from Karachayevo-Cherkesskaya Republic, where the FMD infected area is located.
2. Outbreak in Karachayevo-Cherkesskaya Republic: The outbreak is in the buffer zone with vaccination against FMD. It is 3 km from the 1st outbreak reported on 3 Jun 2013. The distance from the outbreak to the border with Georgia is 60 km. Wild, cloven-hoofed animals could be the possible source of infection.

Control measures
Measures applied: Quarantine, Movement control inside the country, Screening, Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s), Modified stamping out, No vaccination, No treatment of affected animals.

Measures to be applied: Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s).

[The locations of the 2 reported outbreaks are shown in the interactive map appended to the OIE follow-up report at the source URL.

The All-Russian Research Institute of Animal Health (ARRIAH) in Vladimir, Russia is the lead veterinary research facility in Russia and the designated location for FMD monitoring, research, and vaccine development. Additionally, it is an OIE Collaborating Center for FMD. ARRIAH has a collection of approximately 550 field isolates of FMD strains, many of which are from critical regions of interest, such as the Middle East, as well as countries which border Russia and/or have been part of the previous soviet block in the Caucasus region and central Asia, such as Kazakhstan. ARRIAH's impressive diagnostic and research facility is capable of identifying new FMD strains and of genotyping them, addressing domestic as well as susceptible wild species. Hopefully, results of such tests will become accessible, following the exemplary transparency applied by the world reference laboratory for FMD (Pirbright).

According to Russia's Rosselhoznadzor web-site, ARRIAH will hold, from 24 to 27 Jun 2013, a seminar for veterinary specialists of the Russian Federation, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan, with the assistance of the OIE, FAO, as well as veterinary experts on the prevention and eradication of FMD.

The suspicion of wild, cloven-hoofed animals as a possible source of infection in Karachay-Cherkess, adjacent to the border with Georgia, deserves attention. Further information, including species involved and clinical data, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS.
