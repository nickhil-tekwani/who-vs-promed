Chickenpox in Singapore
-----------------------
The recent outbreak of chickenpox among foreign workers in Singapore
was not unexpected. Since 1990, Singapore has reported some of the
highest rates of varicella in the region, followed by Hong Kong. I
have compared recent reporting statistics with those of neigboring
countries in a graph at:

Rates for the United States are included for comparison.
