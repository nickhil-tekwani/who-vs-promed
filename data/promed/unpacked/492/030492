New Crop Protection Method Could Save U.S. Farmers Billions
Microorganisms Show Promise in Battle Against Scab
--------------------------------------------------
Naturally occurring microorganisms could be used to control "scab," a
fungal disease that has cost U.S. farmers over $3 billion in the last 10
years, researchers reported here today at the 220th national meeting of the
American Chemical Society, the world's largest scientific society.
Scab - known among crop scientists as fusarium head blight or FHB -
threatens millions of acres of wheat, barley and rye each year. Current
strategies to combat FHB are limited, says Dr. David Schisler, a plant
pathologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Peoria, Ill. "Many
chemical fungicides are too toxic to use, especially since the blight hits
toward the end of the growing season right before the harvest," he
explains. "Resistant wheat varieties are only partially resistant - nothing
that can be considered immune."
In collaboration with Dr. Naseem Kahn and Dr. Michael Boehm, both of Ohio
State University, Schisler tested 6 strains of bacteria and yeast isolated
from wheat plants, and found that they reduced the severity of FHB by as
much as 56 percent. The effectiveness of the microorganisms depends in part
on their ability to take in choline, a carbon source in wheat that acts as
a stimulant for the fungus that causes FHB.
Farmers can safely apply a biological control agent, or "microbial spray,"
to a crop close to harvesting time because it simply increases the
concentration of naturally occurring bacteria. No biological method of
controlling FHB currently exists, but such an approach could fit well with
"integrated management" of the disease, says Gary Bergstrom, a professor in
the Department of Plant Pathology at Cornell University. A microbial spray,
for example, could reduce the amount of chemical fungicide required to
control the disease. The tests were conducted on durum wheat and soft red
winter wheat, but Schisler expects the microorganisms to work with other
grains as well.
This research was funded by the Dakota Growers Pasta Co. in Carrington,
N.D., and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

[Scab is caused primarily by _ Fusarium graminearum _, although the disease
can also be caused by _ F. culmorum _ and _ F. avenaceum _. Given that
there are no wheat cultivars that are resistant to the disease, development
of biological control measures may have wide application. Genetic
engineering of resistant cultivars may be a another strategy of disease
management. - Mod.DH
