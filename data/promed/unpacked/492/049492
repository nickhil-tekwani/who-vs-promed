re: Peste des petits ruminants - Congo DR: FAO 20120605.1157318
----------------------------------------------
The earlier post -- Peste des petits ruminants - Congo DR: FAO 20120605.1157318 -- erroneously included in its comment section WAHID data on 2011 statistics and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of the Republic of the Congo, rather than the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

ProMED-mail regrets any inconveniences caused by this error.

According to DRC's annual report to the OIE for 2011, 64 outbreaks of PPR were recorded during that year; no details on morbidity/mortality statistics were provided; vaccination is not included among the control measures.

Neighboring Republic of the Congo reported, for 2011, 44 outbreaks of PPR, involving 2504 susceptible animals: 1365 cases and 744 deaths. 53 328 animals were "routinely" vaccinated and 26 917 "ring vaccinated" (around disease foci).

A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of the Democratic Republic of the Congo can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/1Ahy. - Mod.AS
