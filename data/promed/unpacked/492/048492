The reported number of cases of tickborne encephalitis in South Moravia [Jihomoravsk√Ω in Czech] has more than tripled. By the end of July [2018], 38 cases of the potentially fatal disease had been reported, up from roughly a dozen in the 2 previous summers.

There is no cure for encephalitis, but only about one in 4 Czechs have themselves vaccinated against it. The country has 5 times as many cases as in neighbouring Austria, where 90 per cent of the population takes this precaution.

[Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) virus is endemic in the Czech Republic, and cases there occur annually. A 2016 ProMED-mail post indicated that although Central and Eastern Europe countries are endemic for the European subtype of tickborne encephalitis (TBE) virus and cases occur yearly there, cases have declined significantly in Austria and remained low in Germany, Poland, and Slovakia, while remaining high in recent years in the Czech Republic (see Tick-borne encephalitis - Czech Republic (02): background 20160210.4009410).

WHO has stated that "Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany, respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far-Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious." (http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/tick_encephalitis/en/)

Tickborne encephalitis is a virus infection caused by one of 3 tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the _Flaviviridae_ family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ixodes ticks. - Mod.TY
