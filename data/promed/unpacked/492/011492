After a 6-year effort, researchers on the Spanish island of Majorca [Balearic Islands] have rid several groups of Majorcan midwife toads of the pathogen _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_ -- better known as chytrid fungus, or Bd. It's the 1st time the disease, which is devastating amphibians worldwide, has been eradicated in a wild population.

"This is proof of principle that you can go out there and mitigate infections and that the method doesn't need to be that complex," said Trenton Garner, a biologist at the Zoological Society of London, who reported the findings with his co-authors in the journal Biology Letters.

Described in 1998 following mass die-offs of frogs in Australia and Panama, Bd colonizes cells on the outer layer of an amphibian's moist skin, causing the skin to thicken and interfering with electrolyte transport. The infection eventually leads to cardiac arrest.

An extreme generalist, the fungus infects many types of frogs, salamanders, newts, and toads. It has been confirmed in 700 species on 6 continents. Several are presumed to have been driven to extinction, while many others have suffered catastrophic population declines.

Initial efforts consisted in applying an antifungal to tadpoles ex situ. This treatment was successful but infection returned when tadpoles were reintroduced. Subsequently, they combined antifungal treatment of tadpoles with environmental chemical disinfection. Infection at 4 of the 5 studied pools where infection had previously been recorded was eradicated, and remained so for 2 years post-application.
