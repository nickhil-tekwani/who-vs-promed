Romania's Health Ministry said Thursday [21 Jul 2011] it has
confirmed this year's [2011] 1st case of infection with the
mosquito-borne West Nile virus. The case was confirmed in the eastern
Galati County [in eastern Romania], which is crossed by the Danube
River. The patient is a 37-year-old woman, whose health condition is
good. Last year [2010], 4 people died in Romania from West Nile
[virus] infections and 38 others were infected. All 4 people who died
were aged over 60 and had chronic illnesses.

West Nile virus infections have affected the whole of Europe last
summer [2010]. The virus is transmitted in humans through
mosquito-bites and is not transmitted directly between humans. There
is no vaccine against the virus.

While infections are often without any symptoms, people are advised
to see a doctor immediately if they suffer from fever, intense
headaches, nausea, or abdominal, muscular, or joint pain.

[This case has occurred early in the transmission season. One would
usually expect the 1st cases to be reported in late summer. One hopes
that this does not portend an outbreak situation in Romania or other
neighboring countries similar to the outbreak last year (2010).
