Pertussis epidemic -- California, 2014
--------------------------------------
On 13 Jun 2014, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) declared that a pertussis epidemic was occurring in the state when reported incidence was more than 5 times greater than baseline levels. The incidence of pertussis in the USA is cyclical, with peaks every 3-5 years, as the number of susceptible persons in the population increases. The last pertussis epidemic in California occurred in 2010, when approximately 9000 cases were reported, including 808 hospitalizations and 10 infant deaths, for a statewide incidence of 24.6 cases per 100 000 population (1). During 1 Jan-26 Nov 2014, a total of 9935 cases of pertussis with onset in 2014 were reported to CDPH, for a statewide incidence of 26.0 cases per 100 000. CDPH is working closely with local health departments to prioritize public health activities, with the primary goal of preventing severe cases of pertussis, which typically occurs in infants. All prenatal care providers are being encouraged to provide tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) to pregnant women during each pregnancy, ideally at 27-36 weeks' gestation, as is recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (4), or refer patients to an alternative provider, such as a pharmacy or local public health department, to receive Tdap.

For this analysis, case report forms with preliminary data on demographics, symptoms, clinical course, and exposures were completed by local and state health department investigators through patient interviews and medical record reviews and were available for 8562 (86 percent) cases. All cases met either the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists definition for confirmed pertussis, its definition for probable pertussis,* or the CDPH definition for suspected pertussis (2).

Disease incidence in California among infants aged less than 12 months was 174.6 cases per 100 000 during 1 Jan-26 Nov 2014, and was significantly higher among Hispanic infants (rate ratio = 1.7; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 1.5-2.1) and lower among Asian/Pacific Islander infants (rate ratio = 0.4; CI = 0.3-0.6) than among white, non-Hispanic infants (Table 1 [for Tables, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]). Of 6790 cases with available data, 347 patients had been hospitalized, including 275 (79 percent) who were aged less than 12 months, of whom 214 (62 percent of those hospitalized) were aged less than 4 months. Among hospitalized infants aged less than 12 months with complete information, 33 percent required intensive care; few (24 percent) had received any doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) (Table 2). One death was reported in an infant aged 5 weeks at the time of illness onset. 2 additional fatal cases in infants who became ill in 2013 were also reported in early 2014; both were aged less than 5 weeks at the time of illness onset, and 1 was hospitalized for more than a year before succumbing to pertussis-related complications.

Of 211 (50 percent) infants aged less than 4 months whose mothers' Tdap immunization histories were available, only 35 (17 percent) had mothers who reported receiving Tdap at 27-36 weeks' gestation during their most recent pregnancy. Among mothers not vaccinated during pregnancy, 56 (36 percent) received Tdap within 7 days after delivery.

Disease incidence was also high among older children and adolescents, peaking at 137.8 cases per 100 000 among adolescents aged 15 years (Figure [for Figure, see source URL above - Mod.LL]). Among the 2006 cases in adolescents aged 14-16 years, 5 patients (0.2 percent) were hospitalized; 4 were admitted for 2 days or less, and 1 was admitted for 5 days. Among the 83 percent of adolescent cases aged 14-16 years with known vaccination histories, only 2.2 percent reported never receiving any doses of pertussis-containing vaccine. Of those vaccinated adolescents with complete data, 87 percent had previously received the Tdap booster vaccine, and the median length of time since prior Tdap dose was 3 years (range = 0-7 years). Of the 1321 (66 percent) adolescents aged 14-16 years with known race and ethnicity, rates were highest among non-Hispanic white (166.2 cases per 100 000) adolescents and lower among Hispanic (64.2 per 100,000), Asian/Pacific Islander (43.9 per 100 000) and non-Hispanic black (23.7 per 100 000) adolescents.

Discussion
----------
Because infants aged less than 12 months have the greatest risk for hospitalization and death from pertussis, public health strategies have been prioritized towards preventing disease in this age group. During the 2010 pertussis epidemic in California, the main strategy used to protect infants was "cocooning" (that is, vaccinating contacts of infants so they do not transmit pertussis to the infant). However, this strategy is difficult to implement, and even if all anticipated contacts could be immunized, infants could still be exposed to infected persons in the community.

In 2011, data became available demonstrating efficient transplacental transfer of antipertussis antibodies to the fetus, which might protect vulnerable infants until they are old enough to receive the primary DTaP series beginning at aged 2 months. In that year, ACIP recommended that pregnant women who had never received Tdap receive a dose after 20 weeks' gestation (3). In 2012, ACIP reviewed data indicating that antipertussis antibody concentrations declined substantially 1 year after vaccination; therefore, ACIP recommended that Tdap be administered during the third trimester of every pregnancy. Since the immune response to Tdap peaks about 2 weeks after administration and the majority of maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus at 36-40 weeks' gestation, Tdap is currently recommended at 27-36 weeks gestation to optimize antibody transfer and protection at birth (4,5). Preliminary data indicate that infants born to vaccinated mothers have a lower risk for pertussis early in life (6).

Very few mothers of infants with pertussis had received Tdap during pregnancy; many more were vaccinated after delivery, which does not confer any direct protection to the infant and is no longer a preferred strategy. Recently published data indicate that Tdap vaccination coverage among pregnant women was only 19.5 percent in 2012 across California Vaccine Safety Datalink sites (7). Similarly, in a survey conducted at 100 birthing hospitals in California during October 2013, only 25 percent of new mothers reported receiving Tdap during pregnancy, whereas an additional 44 percent received Tdap in the hospital after delivery (CDPH, unpublished data, 2013). However, efforts to increase vaccine coverage have been successful among Northern California Kaiser patients, and in the third quarter of 2014, an estimated 84 percent of pregnant women received Tdap vaccine in their third trimester (T. Flanagan; Northern California Kaiser; personal communications; 26 Nov 2014).

Prenatal care providers should vaccinate all pregnant patients with Tdap during the third trimester of each pregnancy, ideally at 27-36 weeks' gestation, as is recommended by ACIP (4). If Tdap cannot be administered on-site during routine prenatal care visits, CDPH encourages prenatal care providers to take the following steps: 1) provide the patient with a strong recommendation and patient-specific prescription for Tdap; 2) refer the patient to specific alternative sites for vaccine, such as pharmacies, primary care providers, or local health departments; and 3) assess Tdap status at follow-up visits to confirm and record receipt of vaccine. In addition, timely initiation of the primary DTaP infant series is essential for reducing severe disease in young infants. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, DTaP can be administered to infants at an accelerated schedule, with the first dose administered as early as age 6 weeks, when pertussis is prevalent in the community. Even 1 dose of DTaP might offer some protection against serious pertussis disease in infants (8).

Hispanic infants age less than 12 months have the highest and Asian/Pacific Islanders of all ages have the lowest rates of disease compared with other racial and ethnic groups. However, the Hispanic overrepresentation among infants disappeared by age 1 year, and disease incidence among older children and adolescents was highest among non-Hispanic whites, similar to trends reported previously in California (1). Nationally, since the 1990s, Hispanic infants have been noted to have higher rates of reported disease and pertussis-related deaths compared with non-Hispanic infants (8). The causes of these disparities are unknown, and data are needed to assess the contributing factors. Current hypotheses attribute the disparities to larger household size and/or cultural practices that increase the number of persons in contact with young infants.

Notably, the peak age of disease incidence beyond infancy increased to age 14-16 years in 2014 compared with the peak among children aged 10 years during the 2010 pertussis epidemic (1). Children and teenagers born in the USA since 1997 have only received acellular pertussis vaccine, and the upper age of this cohort correlates with the peak age in incidence during both epidemic years. Data available since the 2010 epidemic indicate that immunity conferred by acellular vaccines, particularly when used for the primary series, wanes more rapidly than that conferred by older, whole-cell vaccines that were used in the United States from the 1940s to the 1990s. Because of vaccine safety concerns related to whole-cell pertussis vaccines, acellular pertussis vaccines were developed and recommended in 1992 for the 4th and 5th doses of the pertussis vaccine series and for all 5 doses in 1997. Acellular pertussis vaccines are less reactogenic than whole-cell vaccines, but the immunity conferred by them wanes more quickly. Most of the cases among adolescents aged 14-16 years were among those who had previously received Tdap 3 years or more earlier, suggesting that their illness was the result of waning immunity. It is likely that increased incidence will continue to be observed among this cohort in the absence of a new vaccine or more effective vaccination strategy. Although the highest burden of disease is currently being observed in adolescents aged 14-16 years, severe disease is uncommon at this age, and less than 0.5 percent of reported cases in this age group resulted in hospitalization. More data are needed to assess the potential benefit and timing of Tdap booster doses.

CDPH is working with local public health departments as well as prenatal and pediatric health care providers, with the primary goal of encouraging vaccination of pregnant women and infants. In addition, CDPH is providing free Tdap to local health departments and community health centers to support vaccination of uninsured and underinsured pregnant women and is working to identify and mitigate barriers to Tdap vaccination for pregnant women. CDPH has been working closely with California local health departments to modify guidance for managing the high burden of disease in older children and teenagers, including school outbreaks of pertussis, by prioritizing follow-up of patients and contacts who are at higher risk for developing severe disease (9).

As long as currently available acellular pertussis vaccines are in use, it is likely that the "new normal" will be higher disease incidence throughout pertussis cycles. The number of reported cases in 2014 has surpassed that of the 2010 epidemic and represents the most cases reported in California in nearly 70 years (1). However, it is important to put the current pertussis epidemic in historical perspective. In the immediate prevaccine era, there were approximately 157 reported cases of pertussis per 100 000 population in the USA, with 1.5 deaths per 1000 infants (10). Therefore, despite the limitations of currently available pertussis vaccines, they continue to have an important impact on pertussis. Strategies to prevent the most severe cases of pertussis, which occur primarily in young infants, should be prioritized.

[Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care.

A recent publication confirms that safety of maternal pertussis immunization: Kharbanda EO, Vazquez-Benitez G, Lipkind HS, et al: Evaluation of the association of maternal pertussis vaccination with obstetric events and birth outcomes. JAMA. 2014; 312(18): 1897-904 (http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1930817).

Abstract
--------
In 2010, due to a pertussis outbreak and neonatal deaths, the California Department of Health recommended that the tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) be administered during pregnancy. Tdap is now recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for all pregnant women, preferably between 27 and 36 weeks' gestation. Limited data exist on Tdap safety during pregnancy.

Objective:
To evaluate whether maternal Tdap vaccination during pregnancy is associated with increased risks of adverse obstetric events or adverse birth outcomes.

Design and setting:
Retrospective, observational cohort study using administrative health care databases from 2 California Vaccine Safety Datalink sites.

Participants and exposures:
Of 123 494 women with singleton pregnancies ending in a live birth between 1 Jan 2010, and 15 Nov 2012, 26 229 (21 percent) received Tdap during pregnancy and 97 265 did not.

Main outcomes and measures:
Risks of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) births (less than 10th percentile), chorioamnionitis, preterm birth (less than 37 weeks' gestation), and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were evaluated. Relative risk (RR) estimates were adjusted for site, receipt of another vaccine during pregnancy, and propensity to receive Tdap during pregnancy. Cox regression was used for preterm delivery, and Poisson regression for other outcomes.

Results:
Vaccination was not associated with increased risks of adverse birth outcomes: crude estimates for preterm delivery were 6.3 percent of vaccinated and 7.8 percent of unvaccinated women (adjusted RR, 1.03; 95 percent CI, 0.97-1.09); 8.4 percent of vaccinated and 8.3 percent of unvaccinated had an SGA birth (adjusted RR, 1.00; 95 percent CI, 0.96-1.06). Receipt of Tdap before 20 weeks was not associated with hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (adjusted RR, 1.09; 95 percent CI, 0.99-1.20); chorioamnionitis was diagnosed in 6.1 percent of vaccinated and 5.5 percent of unvaccinated women (adjusted RR, 1.19; 95 percent CI, 1.13-1.26).

Conclusions and relevance:
In this cohort of women with singleton pregnancies that ended in live birth, receipt of Tdap during pregnancy was not associated with increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy or preterm or SGA birth, although a small but statistically significant increased risk of chorioamnionitis diagnosis was observed. - Mod.LL
