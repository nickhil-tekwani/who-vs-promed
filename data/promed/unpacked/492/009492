Further clarification of this posting is necessary. Bluetongue (BT) and BT
viruses do NOT occur "throughout the United States." The New England and
northeastern States (States bordering the Great Lakes) are considered
bluetongue-free because there are no competent BT virus vectors in these
states. Bluetongue, to my knowledge, has never been diagnosed in the
northeast; BT viruses, likewise, have not been isolated from ruminants or
biting flies in the northeast. The other States East of the Mississippi
River are normally considered bluetongue-free for the same reason.
The primary BT virus vector in the United States is _Culicoides sonorensis_
(formerly _Culicoides variipennis sonorensis_). This vector is commonly
found in the Western US. While the range of _C. sonorensis_ is not static
and may fluctuate annually depending upon climatic and ecologic factors, as
one moves East, it is replaced by _Culicoides variipennis variipennis_ which
has been demonstrated by the research of Walter Tabachnick to NOT be a
vector of BT virus serotypes found in the US. Walter's research shows oral
susceptibility is genetically controlled, i.e., _C.v. variipennis_ is
genetically incapable of transmitting BT viruses.
While there is certainly far more information that I could convey, in the
interest of brevity, I refer those interested in more information on
bluetongue, BT viruses, and the biting fly vectors to: "Bluetongue, African
Horse Sickness, and Related Orbiviruses; Proceedings of the Second
International Symposium," TE Walton and BI Osburn, CRC Press, Boca Raton,
FL, 1992, or to Walter J. Tabachnick's elegant research publications.

[Tom, I appreciate your update on BT virus; however, sometimes it is
necessary to use more of a generality, as 'throughout the US', rather than
to name all the states and regions where it does or does not occur. Thank
you for the information. This thread is now cut. - Mod.TG
