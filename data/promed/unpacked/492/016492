West Nile virus surveillance data as of Wed 3 Sep 2003
------------------------------------------------------
Human
-----
As of Wed 3 Sep 2003, there have been a total of 131 probable or confirmed
cases of human infection in Canada, Saskatchewan being the most severely
affected province, with 69 probable or confirmed cases:
Province / No. probable cases / No. confirmed cases / No. deaths
Nova Scotia / 1 / 0 / 0
Ontario / 10 / 1 / 0
Manitoba / 5 / 1 / 0
Saskatchewan / 59 / 10 / 0
Alberta / 43 / 5 / 0
Total 118 / 13 / 0
[The probable case in Nova Scotia is considered to be travel related and
not an indigenous case (see: West Nile virus, human - Canada (Nova Scotia)
ex USA 20030825.2145). Since the last update on Wed 26 Aug 2003, there has
been an approximately 3-fold increase in the number of probable or
confirmed cases, from 40 to 131. More than half the cases have occurred in
the province of Saskatchewan, with Alberta coming a close second. In 2002,
there were 416 probable or confirmed cases of human West Nile virus
infection in Canada and 21 deaths attributed to the virus. All the deaths
and most of the cases occurred in Ontario and Quebec, in contrast to the
situation in 2003, when few cases have been reported from Ontario and none
from Quebec. - Mod.CP]
Equines
-------
As of Wed 3 Sep 2003, 85 presumptive or confirmed equine cases have been
reported; Quebec (4), Ontario (15), Manitoba (23), Saskatchewan (28),
Alberta (15).
[The number of presumptive or confirmed equine cases of West Nile virus
infection has increased by 21 since 26 Aug 2003. The new cases have been
reported from the prairie provinces of Manitoba (9), Saskatchewan (7), and
Alberta (5). The only confirmed case among the 15 equine cases in Ontario
is believed to have contracted the infection during residence in the United
States. - Mod.CP]
Mosquitoes
----------
As of Wed 3 Sep 2003, 201 pools of mosquitoes have tested positive; Quebec
(27), Ontario (53), Manitoba (79), Saskatchewan (13), Alberta (29).
[This represents a more than doubling of the number of positive mosquito
pools since 26 Aug 2003. In contrast to the data for other animals, the
greatest increases were observed in Ontario (39) and Manitoba (30). - Mod.CP]
Wild birds
----------
As of Wed 3 Sep 2003, the following test results by province have been
reported:
Province / No. submitted for testing / No. tested / No. confirmed positive
Newfoundland and Labrador / 68 / 63 / 0
Prince Edward Island / 248 / 231 / 0
Nova Scotia / 722 / 688 / 1
New Brunswick / 762 / 714 / 5
Quebec / 1783 / 1673 / 204
Ontario / 1581 / 1366 / 149*
Manitoba / 902 / 804 / 118
Saskatchewan / 1195 / 955 / 156
Alberta / 1425 / 1408 / 209
British Columbia / 1756 / 1727 / 0
Yukon / 14 / 13 / 0
Northwest Territories / 15 / 15 / 0
Nunavut / 2 / 2 / 0
*An additional 23 birds are listed as presumed positive in the Ontario
count; after the 4th confirmed positive bird, no further testing is carried
out and the birds are listed as presumed positive.
[The totals for Canada for 2003 so far are 10 473 birds submitted for
testing, 9659 birds tested, and 842 confirmed West Nile virus positive. In
addition there were 2756 sightings of dead birds recorded. This represents
an increase of 363 birds tested and 191 more birds confirmed positive since
the last update on Wed 26 Aug 2003. There has been no extension of range.
The single confirmed positive bird in Nova Scotia was previously listed as
presumed positive. - Mod.CP]
