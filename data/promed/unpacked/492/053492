From: Dr. H. Schmitz <schmitz@bni.uni-hamburg.de>

A 57 year old Nigerian business man fell ill during the first week of March
2000 with high fever, diarrhea and a slight increase in aminotransferases
[The aminotransferase assays for AST and ALT are two commonly used liver
function tests. -Man. Ed. DS and was treated in by a German medical team
in Abudja, Nigeria. Here he developed neurological symptoms
(unconsciousness and convulsions) and was transferred to Germany into a
neurological clinic at Wiesbaden on 26 Mar 2000.
Here he had neither fever and nor haemorrhagic diathesis and the
neurological symptoms slowly disappeared. He left the bed and walked
around. Then he suddenly died of a embolia of the lung [pulmonary emboli
-DS. On Friday [31 Mar 2000 we got a serum and CSF sample to look for
neurotropic viruses. To our surprise both in the serum and CSF sample high
IgG and IgM antibody titres to Lassavirus were found. RT-PCR for Lassa RNA
was positive in the CSF but not in the serum sample. Upon sequencing, the
homology to the Nigeria strain was 81%, to Sierra Leone strain (Josiah
68%). Our data show that Lassa
encephalopathia is associated with virus replication in the brain.
This is the second imported Lassa fever case we have diagnosed in Germany
this year.
