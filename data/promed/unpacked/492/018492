The Idaho Department of Fish and Game says a great-horned owl in Custer County has tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, and people are asked to report any dead or sick wild birds on Fish and Game's Wildlife Health webpage. The recent detection follows a trend seen in other parts of the country where sporadic deaths of migrating waterfowl and other birds provided the first indication that HPAI is present in an area.

Avian influenza infections are caused by a virus that can infect poultry and are carried by wild birds. While all types of avian influenza are contagious to other birds, some can cause high rates of death and illness in poultry, including on commercial farms and backyard flocks. These types are classified as highly pathogenic, or HPAI.

The positive owl in Custer County is the first confirmed wildlife detection in 2022 of HPAI in Idaho, but there were also detections in 2015 and 2017. Fish and Game will continue to conduct surveillance for avian influenza in wild bird species.

The virus poses a low risk to humans, however, some people may have job-related or recreational exposures to birds that put them at higher risk of infection according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To learn more go to https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/index.htm.

Humans can also spread the disease to new areas or flocks, so anyone who handles birds is encouraged to follow biosecurity measures to help prevent further spread. Bird rehabilitators, zoos, and other places that house birds should use extreme caution when accepting new birds, and bring their birds indoors, or maintain separation from wild birds in a covered area to reduce risk.

The best form of flock protection is maintaining strong biosecurity standards. Biosecurity includes limiting the number of people who interact with your birds, washing hands before and after handling the birds and having dedicated clothing and tools for each flock. More information can be found through the Idaho State Department of Agriculture and the United States Department of Agriculture.

With the fair season approaching, ISDA has developed guidance for organizers of poultry exhibitions and exhibitors. These materials can be found on the ISDA website (https://agri.idaho.gov/main/).

The National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a bald eagle in Bosque County. This is the 2nd confirmed case in a wild bird in Texas. The bald eagle, which was symptomatic, was reported to a Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) wildlife biologist by a private landowner.

HPAI is a highly contagious virus which transmits easily among wild and domestic bird species. It has been detected in 38 states across the country. Symptoms include diarrhea, incoordination, lethargy, coughing and sneezing, and sudden death -- though birds infected with HPAI may not always have outward signs of infection.

The virus may spread in a variety of ways -- including through contact with infected wild and domestic birds - as well as by contaminated equipment, clothing, and shoes of caretakers. Because of the ease of transmission, Texas Parks and Wildlife recommends facilities with wild or domestic birds should enhance their biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of introduction. The public can also assist in interrupting HPAI transmission by limiting all unnecessary contact with wild birds. Wildlife rehabilitators should also remain cautious when intaking wild birds with clinical signs consistent with HPAI and consider quarantining birds to limit the potential for HPAI exposures within the facility.

The transmission risk of avian influenza from infected birds to people currently remains low, but the public should take basic protective measures (that is, wearing gloves, face masks, and handwashing) if contact with wild birds cannot be avoided. TPWD recommends contacting the Texas Department of State Health Services for more information on the potential of HPAI to spread to humans and how to reduce your risk of exposure.

Those who find birds with signs consistent with HPAI should immediately contact their local TPWD wildlife biologist or their Texas Animal Health Commission Region Office. For more information on HPAI and biosecurity enhancement, you can visit the United States Department of Agriculture and Texas Animal Health Commission websites.

[3] Florida: bald eagle

At least 23 bald eagles have died from a highly infectious new bird flu strain spreading through Florida's wild bird populations, according to state wildlife data. Brevard County leads the state with 8 eagle deaths. At least one eagle died in Indian River County since the virus was first detected in Florida in January [2022], state data shows.

Eagles make up just a fraction of the "several thousand" estimated cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) among Florida's wild ducks, vultures, owls, pelicans, and several other species, according to Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute spokesperson Carly Jones.

The nation's bald eagle population has largely thrived over the past 3 decades, despite the threats of car collisions, habitat loss, powerline electrocutions, and lead poisoning -- its greatest threat, according to Jack Davis, a Pulitzer Prize winner and author of the recent book "The Bald Eagle: the Improbable Journey of America's Bird". "It is sad to see the flu's impact on all birds and will be equally sad if the flu reverses the bald eagle's comeback," Davis said in an email to TCPalm. "It and wildlife officials worked hard to restore the population, and Americans have only recently gotten to know and to appreciate the species after more or less living without it for decades."

Florida has an estimated 1500 nesting pairs of bald eagles, one of the largest concentrations in the lower 48 states, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC).

This strain [of avian influenza] was first documented in the US last year [2021] and in Florida this January [2022] after a hunter killed a blue-winged teal duck in Palm Beach County, according to the institute. Since then, it had spread to at least 23 Florida counties as of [2 May 2022]. This is Florida's first known outbreak of HPAI, with a "significant mortality event" of hundreds of scaup ducks and other species documented along the state's east coast, according to FWC. Wildlife officials are calling the outbreak "unprecedented".

Florida is behind only North Dakota and North Carolina for most confirmed HPAI cases in wild birds, according to the latest US Department of Agriculture data as of 6 May 2022. North Dakota had 197 cases, North Carolina had 143, and Florida had 74. The number of unconfirmed cases in all states is likely to be much higher, experts say.

[4] Maryland: vulture
Date: Tue 10 May 2022

https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/more-100-vultures-found-dead-213300483.html


More than 100 black vultures have been found dead near the Conowingo Dam since mid-April [2022] after an outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian flu, officials say. The discoveries have resulted in the closure of several walking trails in the area, as officials work to curtail the spread of the deadly virus among birds. The risk to humans remains low, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though one poultry worker tested positive for the avian flu in Colorado last month [April 2022]. That worker, the 1st human case of the virus in the US, has since recovered.

Since its arrival in the United States, the virus has swept through domestic flocks, and millions of birds have been culled. Locally, the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore opted to take many of its bird species off-exhibit to ensure they wouldn't come into contact with infected birds or their droppings.

This came after several cases of the virus were reported among poultry on Maryland farms in March [2022] -- one in Queen Anne's County and one in Cecil County. But no cases have been reported in Maryland since, according to the Maryland Department of Agriculture's website. Cooking meat and eggs to an internal temperature of at least 165 deg F [74 deg C] kills the virus, called H5N1, according to CDC.

Near Conowingo, Constellation officials say they're working closely with state and federal agencies to "protect the public, and wild and domestic birds in the area, including the area's beloved eagles", according to a news release. "It's just an unfortunate situation," said Ted Evgeniadis, who serves as riverkeeper for the Lower Susquehanna, which hosts the dam. He recommended hikers visit the Susquehanna State Park nearby for other walking trials.

Officials opted to close the trails -- the Mason Dixon Trail from Fisherman's Park to Shuresville Road and the Shure's Landing Wildflower Trail (also known as the Lower Susquehanna Heritage Greenways Trail) -- mainly so that hikers wouldn't step on droppings or bodily fluids from infected animals, potentially spreading the disease. "Black vultures have been observed at these locations and these temporary closures are intended to help reduce HPAI spread," read the news release from Constellation. "We will reopen these sites when it is prudent to do so."

Most of the dead birds were found near the 1st guard shack entering the Fisherman's Park parking lot on Shure's Landing Road and near the Mason Dixon Trailhead, according to the release. The gravel parking area adjacent to the trail at Fisherman's Park has also been closed. Officials haven't found any dead birds next to the dam itself or the fishing wharf, Constellation said.

Federal laboratory testing confirmed the presence of H5N1 in samples taken from vultures found dead in the area on [22 Apr 2022], said Stacey Hofmann of the Delaware-Maryland HPAI Joint Information Center. All of the birds sampled tested positive, she added. Since then, more than 100 of the vultures have died from the disease, Hofmann said. "We cannot confirm a total count as wild birds often get sick and die where people cannot see them," Hofmann said in an email. "Black vultures are also known to fly long distances, which means infected vultures may die in other locations and transmit the virus to other birds."

So far, the vultures are the only species affected in the area, Hofmann said. Officials are conducting surveillance and picking up dead vultures to prevent scavenging by other birds or wildlife, she added. Officials are recommending that the public avoid contact with birds, especially dead birds or any that are acting erratically. Birds can have the virus and show no signs of illness.

The first 6 dead birds reported on April 24 tested positive for avian flu, according to Rochester Parks and Rec director Paul Widman. The cases are the first reported in Olmsted County. Three other dead geese were found in the park days after the initial discovery, but none have been reported in other city parks or parts of the city.

"DNR [Department of Natural Resources] will not be doing any further testing now that avian flu has been confirmed," Widman said. Avian flu has been discovered in wild birds in 47 of Minnesota's 87 counties. In Southeast Minnesota that includes Fillmore, Goodhue, Houston, and Wabasha counties. When combined with domestic bird reports from commercial poultry farms to backyard hobbyists, which include sites in Dodge and Mower counties, the disease has been found in 60 counties throughout the state.

Widman said Rochester parks staff have already been working under the assumption that the dead geese found in Silver Lake had died from avian flu since it's uncommon for such numbers to die without an obvious cause. The Minnesota Board of Animal Health reports that the first strain of the current avian flu was found in the state on March 25, and the virus has not been found to have caused human illness in the state. However, the disease can spread when enough virus gets into a person's eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled.

[6] Michigan: merganser, owl
Date: Thu 12 May 2022

https://www.9and10news.com/2022/05/12/highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-found-in-antrim-otsego-county-birds/


Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been found in a hooded merganser in Antrim County and a hooded owl in Otsego County, according to the Health Department of Northwest Michigan. The new cases come after HPAI was found in Michigan's first commercial poultry flock in Muskegon County Wednesday [12 May 2022].

"It is important that individuals working closely with and handling birds, whether infected or healthy, be cautious and maintain an awareness of the situation that has been evolving around the state," said Dr Meyerson, medical director for the Health Department of Northwest Michigan. "Avian flu can spread when infected birds are not properly handled, and poultry owners or caretakers have not followed the necessary protocols."

Other cases of HPAI were found in non-commercial flocks in Kalamazoo, Livingston, Macomb, Menominee, Monroe, Oakland, Presque Isle, Saginaw, St Clair, Washtenaw, and Wexford counties.

HPAI is a highly contagious virus that can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is working with poultry owners to mitigate the spread of HPAI. They suggest that poultry owners prevent contact between domestic and wild birds, wash their hands before and after handling, disinfect boots and not share equipment or supplies to protect the health and vitality of the state's domestic birds.

Pathologists with Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) confirmed on Friday [13 May 2022] that the most recent positive test for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) among the state's wild bird population has come from a pelican found [4 May 2022] in Jackson County. In a press release Friday [13 May 2022], CPW stated the pelican was euthanized and tested after it exhibited HPAI symptoms.

Since [24 Mar 2022], when the first confirmed HPAI case was found in wild geese in north eastern Colorado, the disease has been confirmed in several species of wild birds in Routt, Jackson, and Grand counties in Colorado. The state's first case of the disease in a flock of domestic birds was discovered last month [April 2022] in Pitkin County. The state health department announced the first human positive test of the bird flu a little more than 2 weeks ago. An inmate with a state correctional facility in Delta County became ill after working at a poultry facility in Montrose County. That flock was destroyed.

CPW advised hunters to wear rubber or latex gloves when handling or dressing wild game birds whenever possible, to wash their hands well with soap and water, and to never cross-contaminate tools, cleaning surfaces, or cooking utensils. Several disinfectant products are available that kill the virus, as referenced by the Environmental Protection Agency at https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/antimicrobial-products-registered-disinfection-use-against-avian-influenza.

Birds' remains should also be disposed of in sealed plastic trash bags. In addition, wild species (particularly waterfowl) should not be fed to raptors during HPAI outbreaks, CPW stated.

Citizens are asked to contact CPW if any wild birds are witnessed exhibiting the physical signs of infection (https://cpw.state.co.us/Documents/Wildlife-Health/HPAI-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza.pdf). The Colorado Department of Agriculture is to be contacted regarding possible infection of domestic poultry (https://ag.colorado.gov/animals/reportable-diseases/avian-influenza).

The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January 2022 on the Atlantic coast of North America continues to spread. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. However, it is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that are poor spreaders and instead they may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. The fact that most bird species are susceptible to HPAI viruses is a concern for the conservation of many species. This is the case for birds of prey and scavengers, which are exposed to the virus when feeding on other infected birds. - Mod.PMB]
