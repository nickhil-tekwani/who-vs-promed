The Minister of People's Power for Health made a call to residents of
Guarico state, and especially the inhabitants of the Roscio, Ortiz,
Monagas, Guaribe and Chaguaramas municipalities, to get yellow fever
[YF] vaccination due to the presumed presence of YF in the area.

This information was provided by the Director of Environmental Health
of Guarico state, Aimara Salas, who revealed the discovery of dead
monkeys in various parts of San Juan de los Morros, Juan German
Roscio municipality in Guarico state, and declared an epidemiological
alert and activated a contingency plan, which envisioned massive
vaccination and the dissemination of preventive measures.

"We are taking the necessary steps in order to shield the region and
avoid the possible propagation of yellow fever in humans," she said.

Salas noted that Guarico state had special characteristics that make
it prone to a yellow fever outbreak by having epizootics [in
primates] in various areas near urban [human] populations.

She stated that in the fight against this disease [YF], organized
community collaboration is fundamental by means of elimination of
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito breeding sites, which are one of the things
responsible for yellow fever [virus] transmission.

She stated that although there have been no reported yellow fever
cases in humans, if the necessary measures are not taken, there could
be an outbreak of the disease due to movement of monkeys, which could
be infected.

[YF is not new to Guarico state. In November 2005, Guarico state
reported 2 epizootics, one each in Guayabal and in Camaguan
municipalities. A massive vaccination campaign and community mosquito
vector control is prudent to avoid having the sylvan (jungle) YF
virus transmission cycle spill over into an urban cycle in the
populated areas. This report does not indicate that YF virus
infection of the dead monkeys has been laboratory confirmed. ProMED
would appreciate receiving additional information as it becomes available.
