[Since the start of the epizootic, which -- according to official
reports, started on 26 Nov 2010 (but probably somewhat earlier) -- a
total of 32 outbreaks have been notified to the OIE, of which there
have been 5 in pig farms and 27 in cattle farms. For a map showing
all of them, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9993>.
The FMDV serotype involved is O; genotyping results are anticipated.

The 1st 2 outbreaks, confirmed on 29 Nov 2010, involved 2 pig farms.
One of them notified the authorities about suspected cases on 26 Nov
2010, but the penside test performed on the same day was negative. A
3rd outbreak was reported from a (beef) cattle farm, 8 km from the
1st outbreak, confirmed on 30 Nov 2010. Out of the 29 new outbreaks,
reported in the current follow-up report (No. 2), 26 were reported
from cattle farms and 3 from pig farms. - Mod.AS]
