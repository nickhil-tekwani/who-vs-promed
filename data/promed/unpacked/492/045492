The Pacific country of American Samoa announced it is continuing its measles virus vaccination campaign, which focuses on immunizing all school-aged children.

According to a Situation Report published on 30 Dec 2019, about 98 percent of American Samoa children (12 months -- 18 years old) have received the 1st dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, and 90 percent of these children have completed the 2nd recommended dose of MMR.

On 11 Dec 2019, American Samoa began its campaign to vaccinate all adults with no evidence of the MMR vaccine.

To date, 12 152 MMR doses have been administered to adults 19 years and older. The total number of measles cases since the outbreak began includes 10 laboratory-confirmed via RT-PCR testing at Hawaii State Lab, and 4 suspected cases with laboratory results pending.

All positive cases were due to measles virus genotype B3.

The rash onset date for the last laboratory-confirmed measles case is 7 Dec 2019. This is important because the outbreak declaration will be lifted after 2 incubation periods (42 days from 7 Dec 2019) without another laboratory-confirmed measles case.

American Samoa is a separate, unincorporated territory of the United States, with a population of about 55 000 residents. It is located in the South Pacific Ocean, southeast of the independent nation of Samoa, and is centered on 14.2710 deg S, 170.1322 deg. W.

American Samoa consists of 5 main islands and 2 coral atolls. The largest and most populous island is Tutuila. Recent measles outbreaks in the western Pacific and Oceana area include the following: Australia, Fiji, Samoa.

[5] Fiji: new case
Date: Fri 27 Dec 2019
Source: Outbreak News Today [abridged, edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/fiji-reports-additional-measles-case-vaccine-campaign-temporarily-suspended-19719/


The Government of Fiji reported an additional measles case in a 11-month-old from Nabua who was admitted under isolation at CWM Hospital in Suva who was just recently discharged. This brings the measles total to 25 in Fiji.

All 25 cases are from the following areas in the Central Division: 12 cases from the Serua/Namosi Subdivision (Wailali, Wainadoi, Navunikabi, and Makosoi Deuba), 6 cases from Suva Subdivision (Nabua, Samabula, Vatuwaqa, Tacirua, Wailekutu and Naikorokoro Village in Lami), 3 cases from Rewa Subdivision (Koronivia, Nasilai Village Nakelo, Davuilevu) and 4 cases from Naitasiri Subdivision (Saumakia Village).

Measles is a highly contagious disease; therefore, non-essential travel to Naikorokoro Village in Lami, Saumakia Village in Naitasiri, Serua/Namosi, and Nasilai Village in Nakelo Rewa is strongly discouraged.

In addition, The Ministry of Health and Medical Services announced today that the national measles campaign has been temporarily suspended due to the adverse weather effects of Tropical Cyclone Sarai. Members of the public will be informed when the campaign will recommence.

In a follow-up report on the measles outbreak in Argentina, the Ministry of Health is now reporting 88 confirmed cases of measles, of which 86 are local, & 2 were detected in Spain with 2 weeks left in 2019.

The vast majority of cases were locally acquired, according to officials. It is the worst outbreak of the disease registered in the country since 2000.

The bulk of the cases were recorded in the city of Buenos Aires and Buenos Aires province.

Argentina achieved the status of "measles-free country" in 2000 and was certified in 2016 by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).

According to health authorities, genotype D8 was identified and the MVs / Gir Somnath.IND / 42.16 lineage was confirmed in this outbreak.

[7] Early emergence associated with large cities
Date: Wed 1 Jan 2020
Source: Daily Mail [abridged, edited]
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-7841505/New-study-suggests-prevalence-measles-tied-growth-large-scale-cities.html


This month [January 2020] a new study of the oldest known sample of the measles virus has revealed promising new insights into the history of the disease. Researchers had previously thought the virus 1st emerged in the medieval era, sometime between 400 AD and 1400 AD.

After analyzing the newly discovered sample, they now suggest measles could have 1st appeared in human populations around 1000 years before, as early as 300 BC.

Previously the oldest known sample of a measles virus dated back to 1954, and was used to develop the 1st measles vaccine.

The lung sample had been preserved in formalin, which left it in ideal condition, according to a summary of the findings in Science [see citation below].

Researchers were able to isolate the RNA from the measles virus contained in the sample and compare to more recent samples to better understand how the virus has changed over time.

One theory has it that the measles virus is an evolved form of a virus that's been tied to sheep and goats from that date back to 300 BC and even earlier.

It's possible, though far from proven, that the virus could have made the jump between species as humans began to move toward more densely populated cities with less space between both their neighbors and their livestock.

Researchers suggest the virus depends on large populations to keep itself alive through exposure to new hosts, something that can be difficult because once a person's been infected by the virus they develop a lifetime immunity to it.

For this reason, they believe the virus would have ideally needed populations of between 250 000 and a million people to spread widely and not just die out.

The biggest cities in the world around the 4th century AD would fall within that population range; as many as a million people lived in Rome around that time and Xian, China is believed to have had a population of over 400 000.

"It seems like changes in human ecology really did coincide with the successful emergence of these viruses," researcher Sebastien Calvignac-Spencer told Science.

Measles has been resurgent in the last several years, with more than 9.7 million documented cases in 2018 and 142 300 deaths, the majority of which were children under 4 years old.

In 1854, physician John Snow identified a water pump as the source of contamination leading to a widespread outbreak of cholera that killed more than 600 people in the surrounding area. This represented a milestone in public health, linking disease and population density. This historic example of an epidemiological detective story serves to remind us of the consequences of urbanization. Just as cholera spread because of a contaminated source, and measles likely spread once a susceptible population threshold was crossed, even in this modern age we must pay attention more than ever to our crumbling city infrastructures not only because of the inhumanity of the living conditions, but also as public health risks. Lack of clean running water, poor sanitation, dense inadequate housing taken together facilitate the spread of infectious agents. The ever-growing concentration of people in urban environments leads to a greater risk of exposure to pathogens and a higher likelihood that infectious agents will spread. The best way to address this fact is to address the basic cause, i.e., extreme poverty of large segments of the world's population. - Mod.LK]

[8] Viruses jumping species
Date: Wed 1 Jan 2020

Could relatives of measles virus jump from animals to us?

Some European countries, including the UK, lost their measles-free status, and many developing countries, especially parts of Africa, Asia and Oceania are seeing frequent outbreaks.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is experiencing a protracted outbreak of over a quarter of a million cases and more than 5000 deaths, mainly in children under 5.

And the reason for this measles upturn? Declining uptake of measles vaccination. You need to immunise over 90% of a population to protect it from measles outbreaks. In DRC, immunisation rates are less than 60%.

And there's a potential hidden danger of poor vaccine coverage. Measles belongs to a group of highly related viruses called morbilliviruses, which can be found in various mammals, and these are adept at jumping from one host species to another.

The common ancestor of measles virus is thought to have been a virus circulating in cattle which, according to Louise Cosby, emeritus, honorary professor at the Wellcome Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine, "probably jumped into humans when cattle were domesticated thousands of years ago."

"There are also historical records which suggest that canine distemper virus [CDV] might have arisen from human measles in the Americas, following one or more human-to-dog spill-overs during extensive measles outbreaks in indigenous people, who were exposed to the virus for the 1st time when they came into contact with European explorers," she explained.

A cross-species spill-over is the transmission of a pathogen from one vertebrate species to another.

As CDV has spread around the world, there are many examples of it hopping into other species including seals, cats and even monkeys, often with devastating effects.

In the 1980s, this virus wiped out the last wild population of black-footed ferrets and is even putting some endangered big cat species in peril. To be able to flit from one species to another, a virus often has to adapt in order to use the new host cell machinery.

We call these potential host-blocks to virus infection the species barrier. So, what's stopping animal morbilliviruses cropping up in humans?

"A major factor is likely to be pre-existing immunity, where natural infection or vaccination against measles provides a pool of antibodies, some of which cross-react and prevent infection by non-human morbilliviruses," explained Dr Bailey.

But, as vaccination rates fall, we will continue to see major outbreaks of measles, and this will give other morbilliviruses, like CDV, the chance to explore a new human host.

Currently, there is no evidence of human infection by CDV or any of its close non-human virus relatives, but we cannot discount the possibility, as Dr Katrina Lythgoe, from the Big Data Institute at the University of Oxford explained.

"You might have a sub-population of individuals where there's been no recent measles outbreaks and low vaccination coverage, and therefore low measles immunity. And it's in these people where you might see possible localised outbreaks," she said.

"We know spill-overs can happen -- measles was one after all -- but whether we could get human-to-human chains of transmission is difficult to say."

Often a virus must mutate for successful cross-species transmission. And whilst declining vaccination rates might not provide enough scope for a non-human morbillivirus to adapt and outcompete measles, there is one scenario where emergence might just be possible - The World Health Organization's WHO plans for measles eradication.

If we successfully eradicate measles through vaccination, there will be a temptation to stop immunisation, and herd immunity to measles -- and therefore other morbilliviruses -- will decline.

Prof Brian Willett, who studies morbilliviruses at the University of Glasgow agrees that it's this scenario, rather than falling vaccination rates, that could provide CDV with the opportunity to infect humans. But only if the conditions are right.

"Will it start in the UK? Well no, because most dogs are vaccinated and there's very little CDV. It would have to be in a country where dogs or other animals can develop CDV, for example in the US where there are outbreaks in raccoons, skunks and grey foxes which could spread into local dog populations," Prof Willett explained.

"A lot of things would have to fall into place. Removing measles immunity from the human population, an animal population that is shedding CDV and then the 2 coming together.

"So, if you remove measles immunity from a country where morbilliviruses such as CDV are endemic, then it's only a matter of time before you start to see evidence of humans being exposed. Whether the virus would then adapt to the new host remains to be seen," he said
