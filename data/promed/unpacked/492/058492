An anthrax epidemic has broken out in a number of villages in Tajikistan's
mountainous Badakhshon Autonomous Region [quoting the republic's Health
Ministry.
The source of the epidemic has been located in the village of Rushan, where
over 30 local people have been taken to hospital. The outbreak was
triggered by the consumption of meat and dairy products from infected
animals, the agency said.
The Russian news agency Interfax reported on Monday 3rd that nine cases of
anthrax had been registered in neighbouring Kyrgyzstan's Dzhalal-Abad Region.

[The cases we reported in July from Kazkhstan were from the old capital,
Almaty, and the Akmola Region, near the new capital, Astana, in northen
Kazakhstan. Almaty is close to the Kyrgystan and Chinese borders. A look at
the map shows that the republics of Kazakhstan & Kyrgystan intertwine their
borders with those of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Is there a spreading
outbreak covering this region? On the one hand, (1) it is the normal
'Anthrax Season' which in the northern hemisphere is July-August-September
-- whether you are in Texas or China or Russia -- and would reveal itself
as multifocal outbreaks. On the other (2) Rushan is on the Afghan border.
With the renewed fighting in northern Afghanistan herd owners will be
moving their cattle to safety away from the conflict and there is a long
tradition in this region of these Afghan animals bringing anthrax with them
into the adjoining northern 'Stans; Afghan veterinary controls collapsed
many years ago with the fighting. It should be instructive to see whether
new outbreaks are reported along the M41 highway from Rushan west to
Dusanbe and similarly on the A372 from Dusanbe to Os in southern
Kyrgyzstan. If we are right about a putative Afghan source there will be
other outbreaks associated with the northern Afghanistan border. -
