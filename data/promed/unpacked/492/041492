Laboratory data of the Golwilkar Metropolis Pvt Ltd, an accredited lab in
the city [Pune], reveal that October [2010] saw highest number of dengue
and chikungunya cases. The lab alone found 484 positive cases of dengue and
267 positive cases of chikungunya between June and October [2010].

"Patients showing chikungunya-like symptoms are testing negative when
specific antibody tests like IgG, IgM are conducted on them. This is
unusual," said Avinash Bhondwe, former president of the city chapter of the
Indian Medical Association. Such cases have been seen since August [2010],
he added.

"Since viral fever and other infections are very common in India, most
patients visit doctors only after they have been febrile for 3 to 4 days.
This is the time to collect blood samples for investigations before
starting antibiotics. This is also the time when the IgM antibodies to an
infectious agent start rising and they keep increasing over the next few
days. This initial small level of antibody will be best detected by an
ELISA-based test not only for chikungunya but for other infections," said
consulting microbiologist Siddhartha Dalvi.

[It would be of interest to know what other pathogens are being tested for,
that may be responsible for the febrile cases that test negative for
chikungunya and dengue virus antibodies. Were these negative samples
forwarded to a reference diagnostic laboratory for additional testing?

With the city [Delhi] reporting 8 new cases of chikungunya [virus
infection], and 41 cases in all this season [2010], the mosquitoborne
infection [virus] seems to be on a constant rise. Last year [2009], there
were only 5 chikungunya cases during the corresponding period. Chikungunya
fever is a viral disease transmitted to humans by the bite of infected
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes.

"While the infection was initially restricted to Palam village, it is now
being detected in other parts of the city as well, which is not a very
healthy sign," said Dr VK Monga, chairman, public health committee,
Municipal Corporation of Delhi [MCD]. "So far, the highest number of cases
of chikungunya [virus infection] has been reported from Najafgarh, which is
a worrisome trend. We are awaiting the results of two more suspected
chikungunya cases," he said.

With the morning and evening temperatures dipping gradually over the last
couple of days, the numbers of dengue cases have seen a gradual decline in
Delhi. Till about 10 days ago, the city was reporting an average of 70
cases of dengue daily. On [Tue 9 Nov 2010], 35 new cases of dengue were
reported, taking the total number of people infected with the vectorborne
disease to 5837, according to the MCD report. Shahdara (North) zone with
786 dengue patients has the highest number of cases, followed by 742 in
Rohini, and 642 in Civil Lines. There have been 8 dengue deaths in the city
so far.
