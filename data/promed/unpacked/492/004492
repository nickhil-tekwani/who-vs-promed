As many as 159 birds, mostly guinea fowl, kept at an animal care centre in Memnagar area in the heart of the city, have been culled after some of them, brought here recently, were found to be infected with avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu.

"A team of Animal Husbandry department culled 159 birds, mostly guinea fowls and some ducks, at the rescue centre in Memnagar area. Culling was done after samples of some guinea fowls tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza virus," said an official of district bird flu control room.

After the culling operation carried out at the centre run by "Sarva Dharma Rakshak Seva Trust", and to stop the bird flu from spreading, the city police issued a notification declaring the 1 km [approx 0.62 mi] area surrounding the centre as "Affected Zone" while 10 km [approx 6.2 mi] area has been declared as "Alert Zone".

With this order, people are barred from taking out any birds, eggs or any machinery outside the farm. In addition, people are prohibited from going inside the farm. Police have also banned the sale and consumption of poultry products in 10 km [approx 6.2 mi] area.

On 4 Jan 2017, over 1400 birds kept at a rescue centre run by Asha Foundation in Hathijan area on the outskirts of the city, were culled after authorities found symptoms of bird flu in 7 guinea fowl, which had died under mysterious circumstances.

Earlier on 2 Jan 2017, residents living near Vastral area caught a truck driver when he was off-loading over 800 guinea fowl near SP Ring Road. While 700 of these poultry birds were taken to Asha Foundation, around 150 were sent to Memnagar based rescue centre.

The deadly H5N1 virus has appeared in Odisha capital [Bhubaneswar] as blood samples of dead crows have tested positive for the avian influenza [virus]. The samples were sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal. Around 53 crows were found dead in Bhubaneswar in the last 2 weeks following which blood samples of some crows and poultry were sent to NIHSAD for H5N1 test.

However, chicken sample test reports have not come yet and there is no evidence of suspected death of chickens. Therefore, denizens of Bhubaneswar can eat chicken and egg without any hesitation, informed an official of Fisheries and Animal Resources Development Department (FARDD), Odisha.

According to a senior official of FARDD, blood samples of dead crows sent from Panposh in Sundargarh district, Saliasahi in Bhubaneswar and ward no 2 in Baripada Municipal Corporation, were confirmed for bird flu (H5N1) virus. Test reports of chicken and cranes have not come yet.

The state Housing and Urban Development (H&UD) department has issued a notification to take precautionary measures after bird flu was confirmed in Sundargarh, Bhubaneswar and Baripada. It has directed to burn carcass of crows and cranes found in the state and to administer preventive vaccine to poultry. Besides, it has asked to send blood samples of crows and cranes to the Animal Disease Research Institute at Phulnakhara on the outskirts of Odisha capital keeping the local veterinary doctor informed.

"No chicken has been detected with bird flu in Bhubaneswar and we have not received death case of any chicken in the city," said Bhubaneswar sub-divisional veterinary officer Dr Balaram Sahu. "We are administering preventive vaccine to chickens as a precautionary measure and to date, 5000 chickens have been vaccinated," he added.
