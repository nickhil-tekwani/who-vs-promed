The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 12 Jun 2018:
- a total of 66 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 38 confirmed, 14 probable, and 14 suspected;
- 10 new suspected cases, including 4 in Bikoro, 2 in Iboko and 4 Wangata;
- no new cases confirmed;
- no new deaths reported [to date total of 28 deaths; 14 of them among the confirmed cases].

Epidemiological analyzes have identified contacts living in nearby health areas in Bikoro and Iboko. These contacts are followed and advised to limit their movements during the entire follow-up period of 21 days.

Remarks
- Negative tests are systematically removed from the summary table.
- The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation.

News from the Ebola response
Vaccination
Since the launch of the vaccination on 21 May 2018, 2633 people have been vaccinated, including 793 in Mbandaka, 583 in Bikoro, 1,222 in Iboko, 30 in Ingende and 5 in Kinshasa. The 5 people vaccinated in Kinshasa are caregivers of the emergency response team of the Ministry of Health who will soon be deployed in Ebola-affected areas to replace one of the on-site teams.

International collaboration
- The Association of Chinese Enterprises wanted to contribute to the government's response to Ebola by offering the Ministry of Health a lot of medical equipment for the surveillance teams. This lot of equipment includes laser thermometers and protective equipment.
- The Japanese Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo, HE Hiroshi Karube, presented this [Wed 13 Jun 2018], the Japanese team of experts who will collaborate with the General Directorate of Fight against Disease as part of the government response against Ebola. This team will intervene in the areas of epidemiological surveillance at points of entry and the strengthening of mobile laboratories.

[2] Status of outbreak
- 13 Jun 2018. More suspected DRC Ebola cases amid enhanced surveillance
[Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/06/more-suspected-drc-ebola-cases-amid-enhanced-surveillance
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) health ministry yesterday [Tue 12 Jun 2018] reported 4 more suspected Ebola cases; 3 from the 2 remote hot spots and one from Wangata health zone, an area that includes part of the provincial capital city of Mbandaka.
The new developments push the overall outbreak total to 59 cases, which include 38 confirmed illnesses, 14 probable, and 7 suspected. No new deaths were reported, keeping the fatality count at 28.

One remaining active transmission area
--------------------------------------
Two of the new suspected cases are from Iboko health zone, which includes the Itipo health area, the remaining area of active transmission, according to a situation report yesterday [Tue 12 Jun 2018] from the World Health Organization (WHO). Two days ago the WHO's director-general and the DRC's health minister visited Itipo to assess the situation and support response operations. They also met with patients who recovered from Ebola and visited Itipo's new Ebola treatment center.
In its latest update, the WHO said there is cautious optimism in Bikoro and Wangata health zones, which haven't reported a confirmed Ebola case since 16 May 2018. The last confirmed case from Iboko was reported on 2 Jun 2018. All but 4 of the confirmed and probable cases are from the 2 remote health zones, Bikoro and Iboko, and focus of the outbreak response has shifted to those areas.
Vaccination efforts continue in all the outbreak locations, according to the latest health ministry report. So far, 2507 people have been immunized with Merck's experimental vaccine, VSV-EBOV, including 753 in Mbandaka, 561 in Bikoro, 1163 in Iboko, and 30 in Ingende.
The WHO said though the situation in Bikoro and Wangata (Mbandaka) health zones will be closely monitored, the response is starting a shift to a 2nd phase marked by enhanced surveillance, including rapid investigation of suspected cases, alerts, and thorough contact tracing in remote areas. "This will imply redeployment of field responders and response logistics," the WHO said.

Food distribution begins
------------------------
Meanwhile, the humanitarian group Oxfam said yesterday [Tue 12 Jun 2018] that it has started distributing food to about 4525 people affected by the outbreak in the DRC's Equateur Province. The efforts began in Mbandaka and will extend to the rural communities.
The Ebola outbreak has reduced trade between remote locations, including Bikoro and Iboko -- the 2 areas hit hardest by Ebola --, and Mbandaka. Jose Barahona, Oxfam's director in the DRC, said, "Getting food to families who have been in contact with sick people is vital to allow them to eat while protecting others from the disease." He added that providing food keeps people out of the markets where they could infect other people.
Oxfam has also been working on educating communities at risk and is installing chlorinated water points, helping with household disinfection, and providing hygiene kits to communities.

-13 Jun 2018 - Returning home after surviving Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo - WHO report
Reliefweb [edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/returning-home-after-surviving-ebola-democratic-republic-congo

Lucien Ambunga, Catholic Priest and Pastor for the remote rural community of Itipo celebrated his 1st Sunday mass [10 Jun 2018] since he returned to his parish on [Fri 8 Jun 2018], after recovering from Ebola.

When he was diagnosed with Ebola last month, Father Ambunga was taken to the town of Bikoro where there is an Ebola treatment centre in the general hospital. He was given a clean bill of health late last month [May 2018], but stayed on in Bikoro to recover further. When he returned to Itipo on [Fri 8 Jun 2018] he was greeted by a joyous crowd, who carried him on their shoulders and chanted "The hero this year is Courage (Father Ambunga's nickname)." He stressed how moved he was to be back. "I can't explain to you now Madame. It's too much for me," said Father Lucien. "What I can say, what is in my heart, is joy."

WHO's social anthropologist for the Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Julienne Anoko, says it's important to support people who have recovered from Ebola as they return to their communities. "We need to take care of their reintegration because many of them are being stigmatized by their communities because the communities don't know, they are afraid."

Dada was among the 1st confirmed Ebola patients in the current outbreak to be cured of Ebola, and he is now slowly picking up the pieces of his life. On [6 Jun 2018], representatives from the Ministry of Health and Caritas Internationalis came to his home with a care package - a bucket containing food staples such as rice and sardines and household items such as soap. Dada says he's feeling good, "For the moment, I feel very, very, strong. I don't have the virus." His uncle is glad his nephew is doing well, "As a family member, I am happy to see my relative alive and doing well."

With support from WHO, Dada is taking catch up classes and is hoping to pass his baccalaureate exam later this month [June 2018]. He said, "If I'm lucky and I get my diploma and receive support, I will continue my studies." Local health officials say there are 14 people who have recovered from Ebola in the Itipo area and on [Mon 11 Jun 2018], many met with WHO's Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Dr. Tedros came to Itipo to observe the scaling up of the response in the community, which lies at the heart of the current outbreak.

"Not only have they survived but they are already working to save others," said Dr. Tedros. "It's great that they are better and now it's important that they are helping their community."

The people who have recovered from Ebola created an association on [11 Jun 2018] to provide mutual support and are helping to raise awareness of the community on Ebola prevention. Dada is working at the Saint Luke Health Facility in Itipo, where some Ebola patients are receiving care from the Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) team in collaboration with the Ministry of Health. He is providing counseling to the patients.

-14 Jun 2018. Challenges of administering an Ebola vaccine in remote areas of the DRC
The Conversation [edited]
https://theconversation.com/challenges-of-administering-an-ebola-vaccine-in-remote-areas-of-the-drc-98181
[Byline: Yap Boum]

No one said tracking the movements of a patient, suspected to be a carrier of the deadly Ebola virus, through the dense forests of the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was going to be easy. With no discernible roads, only dense bush, we were forced to travel on 3 motorbikes to get to our destination, riding through areas where no car could reach. There were 6 of us: a research investigator, a medical doctor, an officer monitoring water, sanitation, safety and security and the 3 motorbike drivers. After almost 3 hours we finally found our destination: a village in the middle of the forest. This was Bokongo.

It took our epidemiologist several days to find this remote village. He was tracing the travels and contacts of just one patient suspected of having Ebola. Just before the epidemiologist broke his leg, he identified some contacts and 1st line workers that needed to receive the Ebola vaccine. After arriving in Bokongo we managed to vaccinate 13 1st line workers. But ours was not the only operation.

As health authorities in the DRC continue to try and contain the Ebola outbreak in the north eastern region of the country, there are several teams vaccinating targeted populations in Bikoro, Ikoko-Impenge, Itipo, Mbandaka and Iboko.

The country's health ministry has stepped in to coordinate the response to the outbreak. And the World Health Organization, Medecins Sans Frontieres, Epicentre and others organisations have sent teams of specialists to assist. As a result more than 1500 people have been vaccinated so far. But already 27 people have died since the outbreak was declared on [8 May 2018]. Ours is a race against time - making sure we get to everyone who could possibly be infected before the deadly virus does.

Part of the team
----------------
It's not the first time that I have been part of an Ebola response. As the African representative of Epicentre - the research arm of Medecins Sans Frontieres - I have been involved in Ebola response since 2012 during the Kibaale outbreak in Uganda. At the time I led Epicentre's Mbarara Research Centre. Then I coordinated the field and laboratory part of the clinical trial assessing vaccine's efficacy, safety and performance on 1st line workers in Guinea during the Ebola outbreak in 2014 to 2015. The vaccine was also considered during the 2017 outbreak in Likati in the DRC. But the Likati Ebola outbreak ended with a limited number of cases and the vaccine didn't have to be used.

With the current outbreak in the DRC I came to the capital city, Kinshasa, 2 days after the outbreak was officially declared to assess the situation and see whether or not the vaccine could be part of the response. The increasing number of cases and the fact that the outbreak had reached an urban area (Mbandaka) meant it was clear that the vaccine would be an additional tool for the response.

Testing a new vaccine
---------------------
The vaccination is administered using a "ring" approach. This involves identifying newly diagnosed and laboratory confirmed Ebola patients. Epidemiologists 1st need to locate the people they have been in contact with. And then the patients and their contacts -- often family members, neighbours, colleagues and friends -- constitute the ring who all get vaccinated. First line workers from the health area where an Ebola case has been detected also qualify to receive the vaccine.

This method of investigating contacts is one of the biggest challenges when administering the vaccine. Tracing and following people to the middle of the forest presents a massive logistic challenge; which means that it can take days to find people who need the vaccine most.

The Ebola vaccine is known as a recombinant vaccine. This means that the glycoprotein of the Ebola virus has replaced the glycoprotein of another virus. The glycoprotein is important because it builds antibodies against a virus. Ebola's glycoprotein was added to the vesicular stomatitis virus, which is not harmful to humans. People are given the vaccination so that they can immediately build antibodies against the Ebola virus. The vaccine was discovered by a small Canadian company and later bought by the big pharmaceutical company Merck. The vaccine is still not licensed but it's known as VP920.

Several studies across the US, Switzerland, Gabon and Kenya have assessed the safety of the vaccine which targets the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus. Its safety, efficacy and immunogenicity were also assessed during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014; the results have shown great safety, efficacy and effectiveness. The vaccine is still in the process of being registered - but this is a really long procedure.

The logistics
-------------
One of my primary responsibilities has been ensuring that the teams that administer the vaccine have everything we need in this process. I've also coordinated our activities with health officials, the WHO and the country's extended programme for immunisation so that they understand how the vaccine is administered.

To launch the vaccine in this outbreak we've had to train the locally recruited staff about Ebola, the study protocol as well as good clinical practices. This includes ensuring everyone who gets the vaccine consents to it, understands the study and possible side effects. This has been difficult because we only have a limited time to teach people about the dangers of the virus as well as the importance of the protocols when they are out in the field.

While the WHO team started administering the vaccine in Mbandaka, the MSF/Epicentre team went in Bikoro where all the confirmed cases from Itipo - the epicentre of the outbreak - were referred.

Since then, vaccination drives have not stopped. Each time we enter a village we're greeted by one of the most frightening moments knowing that we're surrounded by people who have been in contact with the deadly virus but may not have been traced. But then we look into the eyes of the people full of hope and we're reminded about why we do what we do: to make a difference by reaching the unreachable.

-14 June 2018. Congo's taxi drivers fear Ebola's spread
http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/nationworld/sns-bc-af--congo-ebola-fears-20180614-story.html
[Byline: Sam Mednick]

Propped against his motorcycle taxi outside a hospital in the city affected by Congo's latest deadly Ebola outbreak, Jean Cedric waved a hand in the air, showing his fear about the risks of his job. "We're picking up everyone who's sick and we have no idea if they have Ebola or not. Why aren't we being vaccinated?" he said.

Last month, he said, he gave a lift to a doctor who had treated someone who died of Ebola. It left Cedric worried that he might have contracted the virus, which spreads via bodily fluids of those infected and can take up to 3 weeks to develop symptoms. Despite his worries, the taxi driver in Mbandaka city never presented himself to health officials, who are vaccinating everyone who's had direct contact with a sick person and then contacts of those people, too.

Nor was he tracked down in health officials' efforts to find hundreds of people who might be within that double "ring" of exposure. It's a particular concern in Mbandaka, a city of more than 1 million. While just 4 Ebola cases have been confirmed here, containing the virus has been more difficult in a city than in the remote rural areas in the northwest where the outbreak was declared in May [2018].

At least 38 Ebola cases, including 14 deaths, have been confirmed in what is Congo's 9th Ebola outbreak since the virus was 1st identified more than 4 decades ago. Officials have said the pace of new confirmed cases has slowed, with none in Mbandaka since [17 May 2018]. Efforts are shifting to more remote areas, where most of the cases have been confirmed, to contain the outbreak.

This outbreak is a major test of an Ebola vaccine that for the 1st time is being used at the start of an epidemic after showing promise late in the West Africa outbreak that killed thousands a few years ago. Health workers are among the 1st to receive the vaccine as they work on the front lines and are most at risk. But some of Mbandaka's taxi drivers argue they are on the front lines of the epidemic as well, even if their chances of becoming infected appear to be shrinking.

With few cars in the vibrant city on the Congo River, the majority of residents rely on motorcycle taxis as their primary mode of transport. "When people are sick they call these drivers to take them to the hospital, increasing the risk of transmission of the virus," Jessica Ilunga, spokeswoman for Congo's health ministry, told The Associated Press [AP].

During a visit to Mbandaka, the AP attended a workshop run by the government and the World Health Organization for 300 of the city's estimated 4000 taxi drivers. "What is Ebola?" WHO staffer Marie-Claire Therese Fwelo asked the audience. "A bad disease that can kill people," the drivers replied.

Fwelo told the all-male group that she saw too many taxi drivers "die from fever" during the much larger West Africa outbreak 4 years ago that killed more than 11 000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. She encouraged them to sterilize their bikes, wear boots instead of sandals and carry fewer passengers to avoid bodily contact. But drivers said carrying fewer people means less money and they can't afford to lose business.

"Two people is double the price," said Laie Ekakya, who usually piles 2 to 4 people onto the back of his motorcycle. He said he gives approximately 70 rides a day and worries because passengers always sweat on him. WHO says the Ebola virus has never been isolated from sweat; the most infectious bodily fluids include blood, feces and vomit. Instead of scaling back his clientele, Ekakya wants the government to provide greater protection, including the chance to be vaccinated.

According to Congo's health ministry, more than 2000 people overall have been vaccinated for Ebola since the campaign started 2 weeks ago. Although the government said it was working on making the vaccine available for taxi drivers it is not part of the immediate outbreak response plans. "All resources right now are being put toward trying to find people who have come in contact with those who have Ebola," said Rosy Boyekwa Yamba, the health ministry's representative in Equateur Province, home of the current outbreak.

While officials say that anyone, including taxi drivers, who have had contact with an Ebola case or with one of those contacts will be vaccinated, the drivers are harder to track down because they're always on the move. "They are a risk and they're at risk," said Jonathan Shadid, a communications specialist with the U.N. children's agency in Congo, which is part of the outbreak response. He said his team emphasizes that drivers should take responsibility for themselves and go to a hospital if they think they've been exposed.

The president of Mbandaka's taxi association, Benjamin Leli, said that's not good enough. "It's not fair that only doctors and nurses are considered to be on the red line," he said. "We're on the red line too, and I don't want our people to get Ebola."
