Minnesota health officials have confirmed an infant death related to pertussis, also known as whooping cough. The infant was diagnosed with pertussis in August 2019 and died in November [2019] after being hospitalized for 3 months. The last pediatric death related to pertussis in Minnesota was in 2013.

"We were extremely saddened to hear that this child passed away," Kristen Ehresmann, director of infectious disease at the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), said in a news release. "Pertussis continues to be a concern in Minnesota, and we want to do everything we can to prevent future tragedies like this."

Anyone can get pertussis, but it is most severe in infants. Preliminary data for 2019 shows there were 25 cases of pertussis in infants less than 6 months old in Minnesota. Of those, 8 were hospitalized, and 2 of the hospitalized cases were severe. "Infants who get pertussis can get very sick, and many need to be hospitalized," Ehresmann said. "The severe cases often require lengthy hospital stays with weeks to months in an intensive care unit. It can be devastating for the family."

Health officials are emphasizing the importance of vaccination, especially during pregnancy, to help prevent pertussis. The tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis, or Tdap, vaccine is recommended during the 3rd trimester of each pregnancy. This recommendation has been around since 2012. Ehresmann explained that when the Tdap vaccine is given during pregnancy, the mother's body creates antibodies to fight off the pertussis bacteria. Some of those antibodies are passed to the baby before birth and offer short-term protection until the baby can start to receive their own vaccines.

In 2018 and 2019, Minnesota had 41 cases of pertussis among infants less than 6 months of age. Upon review, only 18 (44%) of the mothers received Tdap during pregnancy. "We're missing opportunities to vaccinate during pregnancy and protect vulnerable infants from a serious disease," Ehresmann said in the release. "We are working with partners to make sure healthcare providers and pregnant women have the information they need to ensure on-time vaccination with this safe and effective vaccine."

Many infants who get pertussis are infected by older siblings, parents, or other caregivers. These people often do not know they have the disease because symptoms can be less severe in adolescents and adults.

There are 2 pertussis vaccines, and your age determines when you get each vaccine. The diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis, or DTaP vaccine, is given to children starting at age 2 months. The Tdap vaccine is given to adolescents at age 11-12 years and adults. Families should talk to their healthcare provider to see what vaccines they need and when. People who have completed some or all of the recommended vaccinations for pertussis may still get the disease but will generally have a milder illness.

The number of whooping cough cases since 15 Nov [2019] in the East Penn School District has climbed to 17, with a new case this week at Emmaus High School. The majority of cases, 12, were in high school students, according to the district. There have also been 2 cases at Lower Macungie Middle School, one at Macungie Elementary, and 2 at Shoemaker Elementary.

Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a very contagious disease of the lungs and airways. Pertussis can be treated with antibiotics and prevented with vaccines. The state requires school children or school staff suspected of having whooping cough or have a confirmed case to be excluded from school or daycare for 3 weeks from the start of their symptoms, or for 5 days after starting antibiotics.

In a Tuesday [7 Jan 2020] letter posted on the high school's website, the district referred parents to state Health Department guidelines that recommend they contact a doctor if their child coughs frequently or experiences fits. "The best way we currently have to protect against the spread of pertussis is by being fully immunized," the letter states.

Pertussis vaccines are effective but not perfect, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Lehigh County has the highest rates of pertussis in the state, according to the Health Department: 30.5 pertussis cases per 100 000 people, according to 2015-2017 data posted on the department's website. Northampton County had a rate of 11.5 cases per 100 000 people. A Health Department spokeswoman said no other pertussis outbreaks have been reported in Lehigh and Northampton counties this year [2020].

Parents of students at Bend's Summit High School were sent a letter Friday [10 Jan 2020] warning of recent possible exposure to pertussis, also known as whooping cough, at the school. A student at Ridgeview High School in Redmond recently contracted pertussis, prompting a similar letter to parents and guardians. Other cases among those reported in the county (and to parents) last year [2019] included students at Redmond's Obsidian Middle School and Bend High School.

Deschutes County Health Services reported a total of 67 presumptive and confirmed pertussis cases in 2019, a rise from previous years, a representative said Saturday [11 Jan 2020]. They were primarily in school-aged children.

Friday's [10 Jan 2020] letter to Summit parents and guardians, from Bend-La Pine Schools health services supervisor Tami Pike, advised them to take steps to prevent or reduce the risk of developing the illness. If a child has a respiratory illness, the district advised parents to have their medical provider evaluate the student and let them know of the pertussis exposure. State and county health officials said when pertussis is suspected and antibiotics are prescribed, the student may not attend school until they've completed at least 5 days of the prescribed medication, to ensure they are no longer contagious, Pike said.

The best prevention against pertussis is up-to-date Tdap immunizations, Pike said. But she added that "vaccines are not 100% effective, and it is still possible to become ill with pertussis; however, illness tends to be less severe in those people who are vaccinated." Those with questions were urged to contact Deschutes County Health Services' Communicable Disease Line at 541-322-7418.

[4] Northwest Territories (Yellowknife and Tlicho communities)

The chief public health officer of the Northwest Territories has declared a whooping cough outbreak in Yellowknife and in Tlicho communities. There are 20 lab-confirmed cases of whooping cough in those regions as of Wednesday [15 Jan 2020], according to a news release sent Wednesday afternoon.

Last month [December 2019], the Health Department announced 8 confirmed cases of whooping cough in the Tlicho region. Those cases were "isolated and treated," the department said at the time.

Whooping cough is preventable with a vaccine, according to the department. Residents can get the free vaccine from their healthcare provider. Immunity may fade over time, so booster shots are offered every 10 years. Pregnant women should get an immunization between 27 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, regardless of when they last had a booster shot, says the advisory notice. The Health Department said people who suspect they have whooping cough should notify their healthcare provider and stay at home.

In 2015, there were 21 confirmed cases of whooping cough in the Northwest Territories, including in the Tlicho region, Hay River, Yellowknife, and the Beaufort Delta region. At the time, the office of the chief public health officer said the majority of those cases were linked to travel outside the NWT.
