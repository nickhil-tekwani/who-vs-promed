Thanks to Dr Pertti Arstila for his information concerning the cases
on Puumala virus infection diagnosed in the department of Virology
at the University of Turku.

Kansanterveys 1995; (5): 9-11 - Finlande

Hantaviruses cause haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), and occur throughout the world
(1). The viruses are transmitted to humans in aerosols of rodent
secretions. About 200 000 people, mainly in Eurasia, develop HFRS
each year. Puumala virus causes a mild form of HFRS, nephropathia
epidemica (NE), and is found in most of Europe along with its
carrier rodent, the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus). In Finland
about 1000 cases of nephropathia epidemica are diagnosed each year.
Puumala virus has recently been isolated also in Hokkaido, Japan,
from the grey sided vole, closely related to the bank vole. In this
report we describe the temporal and geographical patterns of
infection with Puumala virus in Finland.

The surveillance of Puumala virus infections in Finland

Puumala virus infection is usually suspected on the basis of
clinical features, but the diagnosis should be confirmed
serologically (2). Most serum specimens from cases of nephropathia
epidemica in Finland are sent to the Helsinki University Department
of Virology for confirmation. In the acute phase IgG antibodies only
to the nucleocapsid protein can be detected. The serological
diagnosis is based on an immunofluorescence technique: diagnosis of
acute infection is made on the presence of a typical anti-
nucleocapsid pattern or the detection of low avidity IgG. Enzyme
immunoassay is also used to detect IgM. Data on the vole population
densities were obtained from the Forest Research Institute.

Results

One thousand one hundred and fifty cases of Puumala virus infection
were serologically confirmed in 1994, suggesting an annual incidence
of 22.3 cases per 100 000 population. The incidence was greatest in
the winter but varied widely by place of residence. In the autumn of
1994 it was highest in Central Finland, Pirkanmaa, and Savo. The
epidemic occurred mainly in areas with high populations of bank voles
but the regions with the most cases differ from year to year according
to the size of the bank vole populations. Puumala virus was detected
in one in three lung specimens from voles analysed in the autumn of
1994 from Central Finland.

Discussion

This study documents a high incidence of nephropathia epidemica in
Finland with a marked seasonal and geographical variation. Previous
studies have shown that about 6% of the human population in Finland
has antibodies to Puumala virus, which suggests that on average
about 5000 infections occur each year, but only 1150 cases were
serologically confirmed in 1994 (3). The seasonal and geographical
patterns reflect the epidemiology of the infection in the bank vole
population and the interaction of humans with this animal vector.
Monitoring of the vole populations by the Forest Research Institute
enables epidemics to be predicted. However, the maps produced are
mainly designed to meet the needs of the forestry economy with
respect to field voles, which cause the most destruction to the
forests, and have been shown not to carry hantaviruses. The
populations of bank and field voles alternate in cycles of about
three to four years. Numbers of bank voles usually increase one year
before the field vole populations.
In September 1994, the population of voles was still quite small in
East Savo and Northern Carelia, but it grew rapidly towards the end
of the year (3). This was reflected in the number of nephropathia
epidemica cases, which increased 20 to 30 fold in these areas from
September to December, while in the whole country the increase was
only three fold. Historical data show that nephropathica epidemica is
endemic in the Lake District of Finland, but the incidence may be
affected by the awareness of clinicians and their interest in the
disease. The genetic differences between strains of Puumala virus seem
to be correlated with their geographical separation. The same strains
circulate in the same regions for years with no evidence of change
in their pathogenicity in humans. Differences in the severity of the
disease may depend on the viral load and the human immune response.
Preliminary evidence shows that the human HLAB8 allele may be
associated with serious symptoms.
