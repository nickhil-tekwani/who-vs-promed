[The following questions were posed to John Beier. He has provided some
answers for which we are grateful. - Mod.TG
1) Why is there no known cure? DonÂ´t some of the potent human antimalarials
work?
Penguin malaria, caused by _Plasmodium relictum_ & _P. elongatum_, is
characterized by the exoerythrocytic (EE) forms in many different tissues
and overall low-grade parasitemia. Either organism is capable of causing
rapidly fatal disease with barely detectable parasitemias -- the EE stages
are the key to understanding the pathology (Fleischman et al. 1968. J Am Vet
Med Assoc 153:928-935).
We have described how chloroquine and primaquine can be used to effectively
treat infected birds (Stoskopf and Beier 1979. J Am Vet Med Assoc
175:944-947), and have also reported on the epidemiology of infection and
zoo management issues for Black-footed penguins at the Baltimore Zoo (Beier
and Stoskopf 1980. J Zoo An Med 11:99-105). The practices that we
implemented in the late 1970's are still being applied and the Baltimore Zoo
has their penguin malaria problem under control.

2) Why do the penguins need constant monitoring over the next few months
when there will be no more mosquitoes around?
In terms of zoo management of captive penguins in open-air exhibits, those
penguins that survive their first seasonal exposure to the parasite, often
with the help of treatment, generally live to become healthy reproducing
adults. Surveillance for infections by zoo staff is required during the
mosquito transmission seasons regardless of the age of penguins, and
re-treatment is often necessary. It is further important to note that even
those penguins that are blood-smear negative can still be harboring
parasites at below-threshold levels -- frequently, we found older birds with
blood-stage parasites when they were suffering from other diseases, like
fungal infections.
