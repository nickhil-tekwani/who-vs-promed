As a Charlotte-area boy who contracted _E. coli_ at the state fair
prepares to leave the hospital, health officials say they've
identified the source of the outbreak that sickened 27 people. State
officials say the outbreak spread from the Kelley Building, one of the
fair's permanent structures where sheep, goats and pigs were housed
and judged. No other exhibits, foods or activities were linked to the
_E. coli_ infections.

State Epidemiologist Megan Davies said the illness is likely related
to animal contact, though the study did not implicate any specific
animal or breed in the outbreak. "We know that _E. coli_ O157 is often
found in the intestines of ruminant animals, which include cows, goats
and sheep," Davies said. "These bacteria are shed in the animal's
feces, so if it is on the animal itself or surfaces around the animal
that someone touches, the bacteria can be transmitted to that
person."

Officials with the North Carolina Division of Public Health and the NC
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said they are working
to identify additional protective measures for fairgoers in the
future. Investigators from the Division of Public Health conducted
interviews in person and over the phone to find out what animal
exhibits, foods or attractions the victims came in contact with.

[The outbreak enterohemorrhagic strain of _E. coli_ has now been
stated in the press to be O157, and statistical analysis has linked
the exposure to a specific building housing livestock. The mechanism
of acquisition of the pathogen has not been established and may not
be. Most outbreaks of this sort are related to direct hand-to-mouth
spread after touching the animal or its environment. - Mod.LL]
