Three more Ebola cases have been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Equateur province outbreak, raising the total to 77, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said today [7 Aug 2020] on Twitter.

One more death was reported, lifting the fatality count to 33. It's unclear if the death involved one of the latest confirmed patients.

The outbreak, the country's 11th involving Ebola, was first detected in early June [2020] and is occurring in the same area as a 2018 outbreak that lasted a few months and totaled 54 cases, 33 of them fatal. The WHO said the latest outbreak is concerning because it is occurring across a wide geographic area with some of the illnesses occurring in Mbandaka, the provincial capital that has travel connections to Kinshasa and neighboring countries.

In the African regional office's weekly health emergencies and outbreaks report, the WHO said the outbreak response is challenged by a lack of resources for investigations in Mbandaka and case management in hard-to-reach places. It noted that the treatment facility in Bikoro is full, and that 6 confirmed cases in 4 different locations remain in the community. So far, more than 18 800 people have been vaccinated.

Testing confirmed one more Ebola case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Equateur province outbreak, raising the total to 74, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said on Twitter today [5 Aug 2020].

Health officials are worried about the current outbreak, because cases are spread across multiple health zones, including the provincial capital Mbandaka. Also, a number of confirmed cases are still in the community, raising the threat of further spread.

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, continues to see rising numbers of confirmed cases and geographical spread, with 27 health areas in 8 health zones affected. Since our last report (Weekly Bulletin 30), another 6 additional confirmed EVD cases have been reported, with no new deaths. However, there have been no new confirmed cases of EVD for the 2nd consecutive day.

As of 1 Aug 2020, there are a total of 73 cases (69 confirmed and 4 probable) including 31 deaths (case fatality ratio 42.5%) [now 77 with 33 deaths, 7 Aug 2020]. The case fatality ratio among confirmed cases is 42.9% (27 deaths/63 confirmed cases). The number of health workers affected remains at 3, making up 4.1% of all cases. The number of health areas that have reported at least one confirmed or probable case of EVD since the start of this outbreak has risen to 27, in 8 of the 18 health zones in the province. In the past 21 days (12 Jul-1 Aug 2020), 23 confirmed cases have been reported in 20 health areas across 6 health zones.

Four of 6 health zones have listed contacts, with 451 new contacts listed, most (360; 79.8%) from Bikoro Health Zone. In the 24 hours up to 1 Aug 2020, only 3390 of the 4775 active contacts were seen (71%). There were 194 unseen contacts, of which 46 (23.7%) have never been seen, 19 (9.8%) were lost to follow-up and 129 (66.5%) were seen in the past 24 hours. A total of 11 contacts became symptomatic, 6 in Bikoro, 3 in Ingende and 2 in Mbandaka. A total of 294 contacts have completed their follow-up period in Bikoro. Six health zones reported alerts on 1 Aug 2020, with 411 new alerts, including 9 deaths, registered. Of these 150 (53.8%) were from Bikoro and 71 from Mbandaka. A total of 676 alerts have been registered to date, of which 494 (73.1%) have been investigated, and 113 (73.1%) have been validated. Active case finding was conducted in 190 out of 312 health facilities and 136 alerts were detected, with 10 (7.4%) validated.

Situation interpretation: The EVD outbreak in Equateur Province continues to rise, with increasing new confirmed cases along with geographical spread to new health areas. Challenges around inadequate resources for alert investigations in Mbandaka, and in case management in rural and hard-to-reach areas continue. The constant presence of confirmed cases in the community is of particular concern, along with suspected cases who are not isolated. Additionally, there are insufficient funds available to cover the response required. Although all pillars of response are active in the affected areas, further actions are required to limit spread to other areas, along with intense community engagement with community leaders to prevent resistance to response activities and ensure that communities become fully engaged in response activities.

[2] Survivors
- Tue 4 Aug 2020.
[Stat News, abridged, edited]

[Byline: Tolbert Nyenswah]

If the Democratic Republic of the Congo truly wants to break free of Ebola, it should focus on the people who survived its 10th and most recent Ebola outbreak -- the 2nd largest the world has ever seen.

And it must act quickly: Although the World Health Organization declared on 25 Jun 2020 that the DRC's latest Ebola outbreak had ended, the 11th has begun. More than 60 cases have been confirmed in western DRC in recent weeks, which means the disease is not under control.

The 10th outbreak, which began in North Kivu, was officially declared on 1 Aug 2018. According to the WHO, it killed 2287 people. The 1171 survivors could hold the key to preventing another outbreak, but the DRC needs to develop a program for systematically screening, testing, and supporting them. A survivor program established in Liberia following the end of its devastating Ebola outbreak in 2016 shows the importance of focusing on this group.

During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa between 2014 and 2016, 28 600 people were infected with the Ebola virus and 11 325 died. I was Liberia's assistant minister of health when the epidemic broke out and led the country's Ebola response, including establishing its Ebola survivor program. (Later, as deputy health minister, I expanded the program.) The program had 2 overarching goals: stopping human transmission to prevent the next outbreak and providing survivors with desperately needed support.

Although sexual transmission of the Ebola virus is uncommon, it can be transmitted through semen up to 199 days post-recovery. That meant several thousand men could have been spreading the disease for months after recovery. At the time, Liberia had no way of testing semen.

In 2016, we launched a comprehensive program that provided health services for Ebola survivors and a screening program for men that included semen testing, counseling about reducing sexual risk, and the provision of free condoms. We also set up routine Ebola screening in hundreds of healthcare facilities within Liberia's borders, as well as in neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone, which had also been hard hit by the outbreak. Routine screening continues.

Shortly after Liberia was declared Ebola free, 5 flare-ups in West Africa's 3 most affected countries -- Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone -- were directly or indirectly linked to sexual transmission. These cases were quickly detected by Liberia's disease surveillance program and semen screening, preventing the flare-ups from turning into widespread outbreaks. Liberia remains Ebola free, due in large part to its comprehensive survivor program and active surveillance.

Survivors pose no threats to their communities once they test negative, but they need support. As we are beginning to see with COVID-19, survivors often face chronic health issues. Many Ebola survivors experience fatigue, headaches, muscle and joint pain, eye and vision problems, and loss of appetite. Less commonly reported problems include memory loss, swollen neck, hearing loss, inflamed heart tissue, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

People who survive Ebola also face other types of challenges: stigma, discrimination, grief if family members have died, survivors' guilt that they didn't die, unemployment, and the loss of personal possessions that were taken away or burned. Survivors often find it difficult to reintegrate fully into their communities, where they may be treated as if they still carry the virus in their blood.

Liberia's survivor program supported recovery and reintegration into the community, built community trust, and provided care for those affected beyond the emergency period. What Ebola survivors most needed was the commitment to uphold their human rights and guarantee them access to essential medical and social services. The program provided job opportunities in Ebola research activities and as Ebola case finders. It also provided mental health counseling, routine health care, and specialized eye care that were integrated into the country's hospitals.

The DRC faces many challenges to implementing a similar program, including political disarray, continued violence, and lack of funding. And it may have to do this on its own, as international partners often pack up and leave after an outbreak is declared over.

Fortunately, that didn't happen in Liberia. After the outbreak ended in 2016, the country received critical international support. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) sent ophthalmologists to treat uveitis and other eye issues that Ebola survivors commonly experience. Those NIH ophthalmologists also trained a cohort of local physicians to treat eye diseases, which they continue to do. The WHO, the US Agency for International Development, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention all provided financial or technical support, while the National Public Health Institute of Liberia and the Ministry of Health jointly implemented the programs.

It is vital for these international partners to do the same for the DRC: Investing in a survivor program will cost everyone less than responding to the next full-scale outbreak.

With more than 1000 survivors of its most recent Ebola outbreak, the DRC needs a robust, effective, and integrated disease surveillance system, including survivor semen testing. It also needs a survivor care and support system to help survivors deal with chronic health issues caused by Ebola and to reintegrate into their communities.

Without such a system, Ebola will be back in the DRC. It is just a matter of time.

[The same approach applies to COVID-19. If a program for survivors were established in the DRC, it can work with survivors of both diseases, i.e., Ebola and COVID-19. There are long-term effects of both viruses and stigma attached to both. Enhanced surveillance is equally needed for both viruses, as is maintenance of a strong public health infrastructure. - Mod.LK
