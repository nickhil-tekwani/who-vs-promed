A resident of the Stavropol Territory contracted anthrax as a result of contact with calf meat. This is reported by RIA Novosti with reference to the reference center for monitoring the anthrax pathogen of the Stavropol Research Anti-Plague Institute of Rospotrebnadzor.

Earlier it became known that the disease was confirmed in a resident of the village of Rozhdestvenskaya. The woman is undergoing treatment and there is no threat to her life.

The department clarified that the meat came from an animal that was not vaccinated against anthrax in a planned manner. In addition, isolation of the sick person and those who have been in contact with her will not be required. The reference center reminded that anthrax is not transmitted from person to person.

"The circle of contact persons has been determined and medical supervision has been established for them. Everyone is healthy and has no complaints. Anthrax is not transmitted from person to person, so the isolation of contact persons is not required," the department noted.

A woman in Stavropol region in southern Russia has been diagnosed with the dangerous bacterial infection, anthrax, local authorities said on Tuesday [21 Jun 2022].

Stavropol region governor Vladimir Vladimirov took to Telegram to announce that he had received "information that required utmost attention" about a resident of the village of Rozhdestvenskaya having contracted anthrax. The female patient was in a satisfactory condition, with medics looking after her. The woman's life was out of danger, the governor added.

Anthrax is a serious infectious disease, caused by the _Bacillus anthracis_ bacterium, that is sometimes found in rural areas and most commonly affects livestock. Humans may catch it from animals, typically from infected carcasses, as well as from wool, hair, and hides.

The disease can occur in the skin, lungs, and intestines. Respiratory anthrax is most dangerous and has a mortality rate of from 50% to 80% even with treatment, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the commonest is the skin form of the disease, which is lethal in less than 24% of cases without treatment.

The illness often begins with flu-like symptoms, which can then develop into serious respiratory problems. Hundreds of thousands of people died of anthrax before the 20th century, but the number of cases has been reduced greatly due to the use of antibiotics to treat patients and the vaccination of animals.

The Russian media tracked down the 50 year old anthrax patient. She reportedly became infected while butchering a bull calf. The woman initially didn't pay attention to a small lesion that appeared on her finger, but it kept growing and became painful. She sought medical attention and was diagnosed with anthrax. She has been placed in an infectious disease hospital and is now being treated with antibiotics, according to reports. "I had an abscess. Blood collected under the skin, and then my finger became dark. Doctors diagnosed me with anthrax. I have no rash or anything else. It's all fine. I'm a healthy 105 kilogram woman," the patient told Life website. She said that she had a similar problem some 8 years ago but recovered on her own without medical help.

The Stavropol Anti-Plague Research Institute, which is overseen by Russia's consumer watchdog Rospotrbnadzor, assured on Wednesday [22 Jun 2022] that "there were no grounds for the disease to spread." The measures aimed at localizing and eradicating the anthrax hotspot have been carried out in full, it said. A large-scale vaccination of livestock is under way in Rozhdestvenskaya, according to the media. The patient's relatives were placed under medical supervision despite none of them getting infected. Cases of human-to-human transition of anthrax are generally very rare.

Residents of the village have been told to pay extra attention to hygiene and wash their hands often. The local health ministry's chief infectious diseases consultant, Larisa Tkachenko, reminded that cases of anthrax were last registered in Stavropol in 2019. But there were no fatalities caused by the disease in the region for at least a decade, she added.

[Stavropol Krai (Russian: Ставропо́льский край) is a federal subject (a krai) of Russia. It is geographically located in the North Caucasus region in Southern Russia, and is administratively part of the North Caucasian Federal District. Stavropol Krai has a population of 2 786 281 (2010). Stavropol is the largest city and the capital of Stavropol Krai, and Pyatigorsk is the administrative center of the North Caucasian Federal District. For a map and more details see Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stavropol_Krai. Stavropol is positioned between Ukraine to the west and Kazakhstan to the east. There are no recent reports of anthrax in this area but clearly, the authorities are well aware of it by their efficient response.

Normally, cutaneous anthrax lesions are merely very itchy and not painful. The "pain" makes me suspect that there was a secondary infection, which would respond well to antibiotics. While it would appear to be the result of exposure to an animal with anthrax, it should also be pointed out that "calves" are rarely afflicted with anthrax because they are not grazing, just suckling on their mothers. When its mother dies, if the calf dies, it is from starvation and dehydration. But if he had been licking his mother's extravasated blood, he could have got infected.
