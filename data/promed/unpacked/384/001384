With signs that people are developing diseases linked to arsenic
poisoning, the government said on Thursday [28 Dec 2006] that it had
turned off pumps to 11 deep-water wells in areas in the north of
Burkina Faso where water is particular scarce, adding that it may
still have to close down hundreds more wells.
"People were coming to our health centres with skin diseases in
abnormally high numbers," regional director for health in the north,
Moussa Dadjouari, told IRIN on Friday.[29 Dec 2006]. "So we conducted
investigations and found that it was linked to drinking water."
Over the last 2 years officials from the ministry of agriculture and
hydraulic resources found that the level of arsenic was often higher
than 10 micrograms per litre, a threshold set by the World Health
Organization (WHO). Short-term symptoms of arsenic poising include
vomiting, stomach aches and bloody diarrhea, according to the
minister of health. Prolonged exposition can damage kidneys and
lungs and cause skin cancer.
People in the north complained bitterly about losing their precious
water sources, according to the state-owned newspaper. The government
said that it had started building more wells to replace those closed.
On Friday, UNICEF told IRIN that it has also been testing water in
360 wells it built in the northern provinces of Yatenga and Lorum
between 1999 and 2004 and found that 7 wells were contaminated.
UNICEF said it too had started building new wells to replace them.
Tidiane Zougouri, an environmentalist critical of the policy of
closing wells in areas where people are in desperate need of water,
said that up to 80 percent of arsenic can be eliminated using a sand
filter. "Studies have shown that arsenic is stopped by the iron
contained in the sand," Zougouri said. "And it's a cheap solution
because sand is everywhere in the area." Zougouri warned that with
erosion, arsenic is not only affecting underground water but also
water that has risen to the surface. "The danger comes from any water
that has not been able to oxygenate," he said
The risk is also not limited to the north but to the whole country,
according to the general director of water resources Francis Bougaire.
"Arsenic was not on the agenda when officials were evaluating soil
before digging the wells," said Dadjouari. The government has now set
up an inter-ministerial committee to try to address the problem.

[Frequently, patients exposed to arsenic will have a garlic smell to
their breath and tissue fluids.
--In trivalent arsenic poisoning, clinical effects depend on the
chronicity of exposure.
--Acute exposures generally manifest with the cholera-like
gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting (often times bloody) and severe
diarrhea (which may be rice-watery in character and often bloody);
these patients will experience acute distress, dehydration (often),
and hypovolemic shock.
--Chronic toxicity is more insidious and may manifest as a classical
dermatitis (hyperkeratosis with a classical "dew drops on a dusty
road" appearance) or peripheral neuropathy (usually a painful
paresthesia that is symmetrical and stocking-glove in distribution).
--Also, whitish lines (Mees lines) that look much like traumatic
injuries are found on the fingernails.
--Multiple reports of cardiac arrhythmias exist in the literature.
Reports of prolongation of the QT and ventricular fibrillation after
acute arsenic intoxication make careful attention to cardiac status imperative.
--Chronic hepatic and renal damage is common with chronic exposure.
Lab Studies:
Complete blood count
--As with all heavy metals, microcytic hypochromic anemia is common.
--Obtain a CBC with indices and a reticulocyte [count].
--A test for plasma arsenic concentrations is helpful but rarely
available until after the decision to treat is made. Blood arsenic
concentrations should not exceed 50 mcg/L. In patients with arsenic
poisoning, blood arsenic concentrations commonly range from several
hundred to several thousand mcg/L.
Urinalysis
--A urine spot test for arsenic can be helpful.
--A 24-hour urine collection for total arsenic excretion can be
diagnostic and useful following therapy. A 24-hour clearance of more
than 50 mcg is unusual (be sure the patient has not consumed
shellfish for at least 3 days). Because nutritional sources of
arsenic are not unusual, the laboratory must "speciate" the arsenic
into organic and inorganic moieties. It is the inorganic arsenic that
appears responsible for symptoms and signs. This point is extremely
important, since using just the total arsenic level may lead to
unnecessary treatment for many patients.
--Obtain a urine pregnancy test in women of childbearing age.
--Once arsenic distributes into the tissues, treatment may be
unsuccessful. Clinical trials are not available, but attempting to
remove arsenic from the plasma before it reaches the tissues makes
sense. Because the clearance of arsenic by dialysis is substantial,
hemodialysis may be indicated if available within a short time after exposure.
Treatment:
The physician is reminded to look carefully at laboratory tests.
Generally, organic arsenical compounds found in the urine are not an
indication of arsenic toxicity and do not warrant therapeutic intervention.
Hemodialysis, in the absence of renal failure, has not been shown to
alter medical outcome. The use of extra-corporeal membrane
oxygenation in an infant who developed cardiovascular collapse did
not result in survival.
Treatment of acute arsenic toxicity is supportive. Chelation therapy
is imperative in all symptomatic patients
Succimer (DMSA), Dimercaprol (BAL in Oil), Dimerval (DMPS) are
recognized as pharmaceutical agents used in the treatment of arsenic poisoning.

["Arsenic was not on the agenda when officials were evaluating soil
before digging the wells." One may ask why not, in view of the
identical experience in Bangladesh which was recognized as far back
as 1996 -- see ProMED refs. below. Many of those wells in Bangladesh
were drilled by UNICEF. "UNICEF [has] been testing water in 360
wells it built in the northern provinces [of Burkina Faso] between
1999 and 2004", when it already knew about the problem. Also, "Over
the last 2 years officials from the [Burkina Faso] ministry of
agriculture and hydraulic resources found that the level of arsenic
was often higher than 10 micrograms per litre, a threshold set by the
World Health Organization (WHO)." So why did they wait until
symptoms appeared -- they take time to develop -- before taking
action? One wonders how many tube wells installed in other African &
Asian countries will be found to contain arsenic above acceptable
levels. - Mod.JW]
