New York City: first West Nile virus infection fatality in 2003
---------------------------------------------------------------
An 85 year old Bronx woman who tested positive for the West Nile virus has
died, becoming the first fatality this year in New York City related to the
mosquitoborne disease, officials said yesterday [Tue 16 Sep 2003]. The
woman, from the Schuylerville section of the Bronx, became ill and was
admitted to hospital on 25 Aug 2003. Her condition rapidly deteriorated and
she died late Monday night at the hospital. Although almost anyone can
become infected with West Nile virus, people over age 50 are at the highest
risk for developing the more severe form of the disease that can lead to death.
In addition, city health officials reported yesterday that a 35 year old
woman from Flushing tested positive for the virus and was listed as the
10th person in the city this year to contract the disease. She was admitted
to hospital on 29 Aug 2003 with a fever, headache and stiff neck, and was
diagnosed with aseptic meningitis. She is recovering at home. The youngest
person to test positive for the disease this year was a 34 year old woman
from Canarsie, Brooklyn. She is at home doing well. Of the 10 human cases
of West Nile virus reported in the city, 4 were in Queens and 3 were in the
Bronx. Brooklyn, Manhattan and Staten Island have reported one case each.
In response to mosquito activity in Brooklyn and on Staten Island, health
officials have scheduled ground-based spraying of pesticides tonight
between 7:30 and 6 a.m. tomorrow, weather permitting. Brooklyn
neighborhoods to be sprayed include Canarsie, Starrett City, Spring Creek
and Fresh Creek Park. On Staten Island, Willowbrook, Elm Park, Westerleigh,
Castleton Corners, West Brighton and Sunnyside will be sprayed.

United States 2003 - update; detection of West Nile virus in blood donations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the 2002 epidemic of West Nile virus (WNV) in the United States, a
total of 23 people were reported to have acquired WNV infection after
receipt of blood components from 16 WNV-viremic blood donors (1), and an
estimated 500 viremic donations might have been collected (B Biggerstaff,
personal communication, 2003). Because of the possibility of recurrent WNV
epidemics in the United States, blood collection agencies (BCAs) recently
implemented WNV nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) to screen all
donations and quarantine and retrieve potentially infectious blood
components. This report describes the performance of national blood
donation screening during the WNV epidemic of 2003 and documents the first
transfusion-associated WNV transmissions identified in 2003. Health care
providers should report suspected cases of transfusion-associated WNV
transmission to state health authorities; state health departments
receiving such reports are encouraged to notify CDC.
Surveillance and testing activities
-----------------------------------
Experimental screening tests were implemented to help identify viremic
donations and prevent NAT-reactive blood components from entering the blood
supply. WNV screening is performed using minipools (MPs) of 6 or 16
different donation samples depending on the manufacturer format. A reactive
donation is identified when an index donation that is part of a reactive MP
of plasma samples also is found to be reactive on individual donation
testing (IDT). Donors are asked to participate in a follow-up study to
confirm WNV infection, and the implicated donations and follow-up samples
undergo confirmatory testing to determine if WNV is present. Blood
components from donations that were not reactive in the MP or IDT screening
test are released for transfusion, and all components made from
IDT-reactive donations are discarded.
Several large BCAs that account for about 95 per cent of the nation's
civilian blood donations and all of the military donations provide weekly
summaries of WNV screening data to CDC and the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) that are used to evaluate the national screening effort. From late
June to mid-September 2003, about 2.5 million donations were screened for
WNV; 1285 (0.05 per cent) were initially reactive for WNV using nucleic
acid-amplification tests (NAT) implemented under FDA's investigational new
drug (IND) mechanisms (2). Of these 1285 donations, 601 (0.02 per cent of
the total donations) are considered presumptive viremic donations (PVDs)
(that is, a donation that is repeatedly reactive by the primary and/or
alternate NAT assay or a primary NAT assay with a very high signal).
Results of additional testing are pending for 209 initially reactive
donations. For surveillance purposes, PVDs are reported by blood bank
directors to state health departments with the results of testing; the date
of the donation; and the donor's age, sex, and county of residence. The
majority of states then provide this information to ArboNET, a cooperative
surveillance project between CDC and 57 state and local health departments
that monitors domestic arbovirus activities.
As of Tue 16 Sep 2003, a total of 489 WNV-viremic blood donors have been
reported to ArboNET. States reporting >50 PVDs to ArboNET include Colorado
(154 donors), Nebraska (116), and South Dakota (56). During the period 1
Jul to 16 Sep 2003, a total of 19 counties in 4 states (Colorado [5
counties], Nebraska [10], South Dakota [2], and Wyoming [1]) reported at
least 5 PVDs. Demographic information was available for 333 of these
donors. The mean age was 45 years (range: 15 to 83 years); 181 (54 per
cent) were male. Dates of detection ranged from 25 Jun to 12 Sep 2003. Of
these 333 people, 296 (89 per cent) remained asymptomatic after donation,
35 (11 per cent) had WNV-associated fever, and two (0.7 per cent) had
WNV-associated meningoencephalitis.
To evaluate the sensitivity of the MP-NAT screening algorithm, a large BCA
re-tested archived individual samples collected in regions with high MP-NAT
yield rates that had tested nonreactive previously in MPs. Detection of
samples reactive under IDT triggered immediate quarantine and retrieval to
prevent transfusion of corresponding components. However, some associated
components already had been transfused on the basis of nonreactive MP-NAT
screening results before the ID-NAT results were obtained. Additional WNV
RNA and WNV-specific IgM antibody testing of the IDT-reactive donation
specimens and follow-up donor samples were conducted to confirm reactivity.
As part of standard operating procedures, blood component recipients are
notified if these results indicated that the IDT-NAT reactivity was
WNV-specific. As of 16 Sep 2003, 2 cases of confirmed
transfusion-associated WNV transmission have been identified.
Case reports
------------
CASE 1: On 29 Jul 2003, a Texas man aged 48 years donated blood at a
regional blood center. Initial WNV screening using a 16-donation sample
MP-NAT was nonreactive, and the associated blood components were released
for transfusion. On 14 Aug 2003, as part of the retrospective study,
samples in this nonreactive MP were re-tested as individual samples. On
re-testing by IDT-NAT, the implicated donation was reactive. Previously
issued components were recalled immediately by using standard operating
procedures for withdrawal; the plasma was destroyed, and the platelets had
not been transfused before expiration. The index donation sample was
re-tested individually and found to be reactive; this was confirmed
subsequently by using different NAT formats. Viral load testing is pending.
The sample tested negative for WNV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies. On
follow-up, the donor reported that he had not had any symptoms during the
preceding month; a blood sample collected at 30 days after the index
donation was ID-NAT nonreactive but positive for WNV-specific IgM and IgG
antibody at a commercial laboratory, consistent with acute WNV infection
and seroconversion.
Before retrospective testing and recall of blood components, packed red
blood cells from this implicated donation had been transfused into a Texas
man aged 71 years who had undergone aortic graft surgery on the preceding
day; an additional 4 components from MP-NAT negative donations (all
determined to be IDT-NAT nonreactive) were transfused the same day. At the
time of transfusion, the patient was in poor health and had sepsis. Fever
and signs of encephalitis compatible with WNV infection were identified on
the third day after transfusion; WNV infection in the recipient was
documented by the development of WNV-specific IgM and neutralizing antibody
by the 11th day after the transfusion of the implicated component. In
addition, NAT of the recipient's serum from the second, seventh, and 11th
days after transfusion all indicated the presence of WNV RNA. As of 16 Sep
2003, the patient was recovering.
CASE 2: On 4 Aug 2003, a Nebraska man aged 80 years received 27 blood
components following cardiac surgery, including packed red blood cells
(from eight donors), platelets (12 donors), and fresh frozen plasma (6
donors). The patient was discharged on 14 Aug 2003. On 17 Aug 2003 (13 days
after transfusions), he had mental confusion followed by fever, and he was
rehospitalized with a diagnosis of encephalitis. Serum and cerebrospinal
fluid collected on 20 Aug 2003 were positive for WNV IgM by capture ELISA.
As of 16 Sep 2003, the patient was recovering. All of the 26 persons who
donated the blood products received by this patient were residents of south
east Nebraska who donated locally: 6 in February 2003 and 20 from late July
to early August. At the time of donation, serum from these 20 donors was
screened for WNV using MPs of 6 donors; all MPs containing these donations
were nonreactive. The 6 donations collected during February 2003 were
collected before the institution of WNV testing in the United States and
were not screened for WNV. The Nebraska Health and Human Services System
identified samples of the original donations from the 20 people who donated
from late July to early August, 2003. These 20 samples were tested by NAT
at 3 different laboratories; one sample tested reactive or equivocal in all
3 laboratories. A convalescent serum sample was obtained from the
implicated donor 45 days after the initial donation. Serum from the initial
donation did not contain WNV-specific IgM antibody; however, the
convalescent serum sample did contain antibody, demonstrating
seroconversion. Other components from this donor were quarantined on
reporting of WNV infection in the index patient; no other components from
this donation were transfused.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
Nearly all human WNV infections result from mosquito bites; however,
transfusion-associated WNV transmission resulted in a small number of WNV
infections in 2002 (1). Implementation of national blood donor screening
for WNV in 2003 has reduced this risk substantially by removing hundreds of
units of potentially infectious blood donated by asymptomatic donors. WNV
titers in infectious blood components have been documented as low as 0.8
plaque-forming units/mL during the 2002 investigations (1) and are lower
than the titers seen in other screened bloodborne viral pathogens such as
HIV or hepatitis C virus. Despite these low levels, all of the infectious
components identified in the 2002 investigations would have been detected
by using the current investigational assays in a MP-NAT format. The 2 cases
of transfusion-associated WNV transmission reported here illustrate that
potentially infectious units can escape detection due to very low viremia
or other possible mechanisms; for this reason, the risk for transmission
has not been eliminated.
Because MP screening might not detect low-level viremic donations, a large
BCA initiated the retrospective testing study of MP-NAT nonreactive samples
as individual samples to determine the frequency of blood with low-level WN
viremia in blood banks serving regions experiencing a large number of
mosquitoborne human infections. The findings of this study suggest the need
to develop more sensitive screening NATs for use in MP testing; if BCA
screening capacity allows, replacing MP screening with IDT screening might
be considered in areas experiencing a high number of infections among
donors. Although individual unit testing of the nation's blood supply is
not feasible because of logistics, space, and resource constraints, IDT is
being implemented in selected blood banks serving Kansas, Nebraska, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.
Cases of WNV illness associated with transfusions might be identified
during local health department investigations of patients with reported WNV
disease (1). History of blood donation or transfusion during the 4 weeks
before illness onset is cause for investigation to identify possible
transfusion-associated transmission of WNV. Other suspected cases might be
identified by investigation of recipients of MP nonreactive donations that
have been tested separately and found to be viremic at levels below
detection by current MP-NAT format. During 2003, to assist BCAs, federal
agencies, and state health departments in assessing the residual risk for
transfusion, FDA and CDC have worked with state and local health
departments to conduct surveillance to detect possible
transfusion-associated WNV transmission so appropriate and timely measures
can be taken to maintain the safety of the nation's blood supply. Health
care providers should continue to investigate WNV illness in people who
have received blood transfusions (3) and report suspected cases of
transfusion-associated WNV transmission to state health authorities. State
health departments receiving such reports are encouraged to notify CDC
through ArboNET as part of the national surveillance of human WNV infection.
