A new fatal tick disease reaches South Coast
--------------------------------------------
Got an email this week from a summer resident of West Island in Fairhaven, that I thought would be beneficial to my readers.

"Dear Mr Folco,

Thank you for yesterday's excellent column on the dangers of mosquitoes and ticks. It should help many to avoid the problem. However, another tickborne disease, human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME), is now active in our area. CDC says of it, "Ehrlichiosis is a serious illness that can be fatal if not treated correctly, even in previously healthy people."

I learned this the hard way last summer [2012], after a midnight ambulance trip from West Island to St Luke's, with a fever of 104 degrees [F/40 deg C]. Proper treatment with doxycycline got me home in 2 1/2 days.

I suggest it would be a real public service if you help spread the word about this new threat, perhaps with a brief addendum to your column. It could be a life-saver!"

[Human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) and human anaplasmosis (formerly human granulocytic ehrlichiosis) are quite similar in presentation with fever, headache, and muscle aches with decreased total white blood cell and platelet counts and mildly elevated hepatic aminotransferases. A excellent review of tickborne rickettsial diseases can be found at: CDC: Diagnosis and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis, and anaplasmosis - United States. MMWR 2006; 55(RR04): 1-27 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm).

The geographical range of HME seems to be expanding as is its most common vector tick, _Amblyomma americanum_, the lone star tick from the central Midwestern USA, both eastward and northward (see images at http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Amblyomma+americanum&guide=Arachnida&flags=glean:&mobile=close). - Mod.LL
