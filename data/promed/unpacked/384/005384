So far, 15 people have been infected with anthrax -- there have been no new cases in the past week. [This is 7 more cases since our last report. - Mod.MHJ] The Veterinary Inspection of the State Inspectorate (DIRH) is participating intensively and carrying out activities on pastures affected by the disease. More than 3000 animals have been vaccinated.

Although it is common for anthrax to appear after heavy rains, the epidemiologist of the Croatian Institute for Public Health, Vesna Višekruna Vučina, said that anthrax spores can survive in the environment for a very long time. "This is a little unusual today, but the source of the infection is currently being searched for," she said, commenting on the situation in Lonjsko Polje.

In addition to the animals, 15 people who were in contact with them also became infected, all diagnosed with cutaneous anthrax. "It is, in a way, the mildest form of this disease and generally has a favorable course. It is treated with antibiotics," she noted, adding that there are generally no long-term consequences for those infected.

More than 3000 animals were vaccinated. There have been no new [livestock] diagnoses since 21 Jul 2022, so it is hoped that the adopted measures are effective, which raises optimism. "The situation is under control, vaccination is coming to an end and we should be optimistic," Tatjana Karačić, director of the Directorate for Veterinary Medicine and Food Safety from the Ministry of Agriculture, said.

Measures have been adopted to prevent the occurrence and spread of [anthrax]. Namely, the Veterinary Inspection of the State Inspectorate (DIRH) has implemented various protection measures on pastures affected by the disease, and the livestock is now under official supervision in a fenced area. "According to the latest data, around 3075 animals have been vaccinated since 19 Jul 2022," emphasized Karačić.

Nikica Lukanović, the expert manager of the Lonjsko Polje Nature Park, said that the appearance of the breech has a negative impact on the response of visitors. "They can come freely to all [areas] that are not closed," she said. "We would like to remind you that the order on measures to prevent the occurrence and spread of anthrax in the infected area according to the decision by which the Osekovo, Repušnica and Gračanica pastures in the area of the Lonjsko Polje Nature Park in Sisak-Moslavina County were designated as the infected area (protection zone) was issued by the Minister of Agriculture Marija Vuckovic."

In this way, in addition to the mandatory vaccination of animals against anthrax, among other things, the movement of animals and products of animal origin from and to the infected area is prohibited, forestry and agricultural work, hunting and certain other biosecurity measures are prohibited.

[The Croatian veterinary service is to be congratulated on their prompt and efficient response, specifically in getting at-risk livestock vaccinated.

To remind readers about this park: "Lonjsko Polje (English: Lonja Field) is the largest protected wetland in both Croatia and the entire Danube basin. It covers an area of 505.6 square kilometres (195.2 sq miles), extending along the river Sava from the areas east of Sisak, the lower course of the river Lonja for which it is named, to the areas west of Nova Gradiška, along the course of the river Veliki Strug. The area of Lonjsko Polje is designated a nature park (park prirode), a kind of protected area in Croatia. The institution was established in 1998, and it is based in the village of Jasenovac. According to the criteria of the Birds Directive of the European Union, the park is an important habitat for birds (important birds area: IBA)" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonjsko_Polje). As the park appears to be primarily an avian park, this might explain the absence of any reports of wildlife deaths and possible anthrax cases. - Mod.MHJ
