A horse in Bethany, Connecticut has tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), and tests on additional horses are pending, the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on 11 Dec. 2017.

"Clinical signs were seen on 5 Dec 2017 in a private facility," the EDCC statement said. "One horse was confirmed positive at Cornell University (in Ithaca, New York) on 10 Dec 2017. Currently a 4-year old Quarter Horse mare was confirmed positive, and tests on a 20-year old, a 14-year old, and 26-year old Quarter Horse geldings are pending. Signs include 102-104 F fevers, mild inappetence, and hindlimb ataxia with dribbling urine. All horses, which were vaccinated, are alive and receiving treatment.

"Potentially 30-35 horses have been exposed, and currently 20 horses are in quarantine established by the Connecticut Department of Agriculture," the EDCC said.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

[Hopefully all of these horses will recover. It is interesting that these horses were vaccinated. While there are many forms of this disease, hopefully the vaccine will provide some protection and improve survival. - Mod.TG
