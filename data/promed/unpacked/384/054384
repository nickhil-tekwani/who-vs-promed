Some 1500 pigs were found dead over the last 3 days of causes as yet
unknown in the central province of Quang Nam.
The local animal health center said this could be a new disease with
symptoms similar to those of "plasmodium congestion" [see commentary].

[Any available data on the husbandry, breed, age, epidemiology,
clinical symptoms, pathological changes, and laboratory
investigations of the affected pig population will be welcomed.
Exclusion of highly infectious diseases, such as FMD (foot-and-mouth
disease), classical swine fever, and African swine fever, as well as
highly pathogenic PRRS (porcine reproductive and respiratory
syndrome), deserves to be prioritized.
The applied term "plasmodium congestion" as a disease entity in pigs
is neither clear nor known to this moderator. A quick Internet search
has revealed that this term is applied in Viet Nam in relation to a
disease in poultry, probably caused by _Plasmodium_ spp, but also
named "fowl cholera." A question of terminology, language
differences, otherwise?! 'Congestion', in various organs -- including
the brain -- is one of the common changes seen in cases of plasmodial
infections in chicken. Clarifications, if available, will be helpful.
