More than 120 people are part of a multi-country _Salmonella_ outbreak linked to Brazil nuts. Since August 2019, the outbreak, caused by _Salmonella_ Typhimurium and _Salmonella_ Anatum, has affected 3 European Union countries, the United Kingdom and Canada. The United States was one of more than 30 countries that received Brazil nuts from Bolivia contaminated with _Salmonella_.

In total, 123 cases of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium have been reported, of which 105 were in the UK, 14 in France, 3 in Luxembourg and one each in the Netherlands and Canada. One _Salmonella_ Anatum patient was recorded in the UK.

A case-control study in the UK and patient interviews in the UK, France and Luxembourg indicated Brazil nuts and nut bars as likely vehicles of infections. Two batches of Brazil nuts from Bolivia tested positive for _S._ Typhimurium and _S._ Anatum matching the outbreak strains.

Bolivian authorities reported that both batches had been tested during "own-check" controls at the processing company and that _Salmonella_ had not been found.

Brazil nuts were also used in other products manufactured by different companies in the UK and one in Austria. It is likely that the origin of infections is contaminated Brazil nuts, but the exact point of contamination could not be established, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Food Safety Authority. Recalls and withdrawals of nut products started in August 2020. In the UK, they involved Holland & Barrett, Rude Health Food, Lidl GB, The Paleo Foods Co. and Hand2Mouth, which makes Eat Natural brand bars.

13 people infected by _S._ Typhimurium were hospitalized, including 2 children younger than 5 years of age. One death was reported in the UK, but the role of _Salmonella_ infection is not known.

In April 2020, the UK reported a cluster of 38 _S._ Typhimurium infections with sampling dates between 2 Aug 2019, and 4 Apr 2020. Over 60 percent of cases were reported in March and April [2020]. Patients live in different areas of the UK and reported no travel history. Just more than half were male, and the median age was 40 years with a range of 3 to 89 years old. After 14 months, the outbreak appears to be subsiding, with the latest patient reported in the UK in September 2020.

Public Health England did 13 interviews, starting in April 2020, that identified nuts/nut bars, chicken and salad consumption as potential vehicles of infection. A case-control study in June 2020 revealed nut and seed products as a risk factor. Patients reported consumption of several types of nut bars under 2 brand names produced by a British company.

The 1st batch was imported in the UK by a British wholesaler in August 2019 in 2 allotments of 8000 kilograms each. Samples were collected as part of an official control in early August 2020, with some positive for _Salmonella_ Typhimurium. The 2nd batch was imported in the UK by the same British wholesaler in January 2020 in one allotment of 16 000 kilograms. Samples were collected during an official control in early August 2020 and some showed _Salmonella_ Anatum.

Some of the nut products were heat treated, but the process was only intended for organoleptic purposes. Some flapjacks and nut bars received heat treatment during the manufacturing process that was considered sufficient to eliminate _Salmonella_, so companies producing them did not withdraw or recall their nut products.

European officials said the likelihood of new cases is low but possible, as the nut products have a long shelf life until 2021, and people may have bought them before control measures were applied.

Countries that received affected Brazil nuts from Bolivia are Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Jordan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mali, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, Qatar, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, UK and the United States.
