[It has been pleasantly quiet over the past 9 days, with no newly confirmed cases reported in the past 5 days, Noteworthy is the absence of reported cases from Wadi Aldwasir, with the last newly confirmed case reported on 12 Mar 2019 - 9 days ago. While it is too early to declare interruption of transmission for secondary cases (9 days, with an incubation period of 14 days), it is still promising.

The 3 newly confirmed cases in this report came from 3 different regions - Najran, Asir and Riyadh region. There have now been 105 newly confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia since the beginning of this year (1 Jan 2019), including 20 deaths (reported case fatality rate 19%).
