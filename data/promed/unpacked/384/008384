A mysterious cattle disease has broken out in Chikankata district in Southern province and has since claimed 7 head of cattle.

Chikankata District Veterinary Officer Dr Abraham Msoni has disclosed that his office has since dispatched a team of officers to verify the reported outbreak of the peculiar cattle disease, which has so far claimed 7 head of cattle in Chikankata.

Dr Msoni told ZANIS yesterday [7 Dec 2017] in Chikankata that his officers are currently ascertaining the type of disease that has broken out in the district and further called on farmers to report cases of animal diseases on time so that their animals are attended to as quickly as possible.

One affected farmer interviewed by the Zambia News and Information Services in Chikankata district yesterday [7 Dec 2017] said he had lost 2 animals within a week. He added that his animals just collapsed, and within a short period, the animals lost their lives.

He wondered what type of disease this was since it did not show signs of the corridor disease popularly known as Denkete in Tonga.

Another farmer said the disease kills cattle quickly and has called on the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock to immediately move in to prevent more animals from dying. He had lost 5 animals within a period of 2 weeks and said that quick efforts should be put in place by the ministry so that the disease is contained.

[Details on the dead animals (including age, sex, breed, husbandry, nutritional situation, vaccination history) and on their population, e.g. the denominator (number of susceptible animals) and age distribution, will be helpful for the establishment of an hierarchical differential diagnosis list. In addition: Are animals of other species kept on the same premises? What is their respective health situation?

Sudden deaths in bovines could be caused by infectious agents (e.g. anthrax) as well as non-infectious agents (chemical and/or biological, such as poisonous plants and bio-toxins).

If/when anthrax is suspected, the traditional differential diagnosis would include grass tetany and thunderbolt.

"Corridor disease" (aka Theileriosis, East Coast fever) is a highly pathogenic disease of Cape buffaloes (_Syncerus caffer_) and cattle in eastern and southern Africa caused by the protozoan _Theileria parva lawrencei_, transmitted primarily by the tick _Rhipicephalus appendiculatus_; lesions and symptoms are similar to those of East Coast fever. It is one of 3 epidemiologically different diseases of which 3 different types of _T. parva_ are the respective causative agents; the other 2 are East Coast fever (ECF), caused by _T. p. parva_, and January disease, caused by _T. p. bovis_.

Observed pathological changes and results of lab investigations of the (apparently acute/per acute) deaths are anticipated. - Mod.AS
