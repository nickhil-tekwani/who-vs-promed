First death this year of black-faced spoonbill reported
-------------------------------------------------------
The first death of a black-faced spoonbill in 2003 in the birds' major
habitat in southern Taiwan was reported by an official of a bird watching
group on Monday. Wang Cheng-chi, president of a wild bird association,
spotted the body of the rare bird in a northern fish pond at the Chiku
Wetlands sanctuary near the estuary of the Tsengwen River in Tainan County,
and estimated that it had been dead for at least 3 days, judging from the
fact that the bird's feathers had begun to fall off.
Wang noted that, although Tainan was largely unaffected by typhoon Melor,
which wreaked havoc in southern Taiwan over the weekend, the association
mobilized all its members to conduct a thorough check of the wetlands and
found the bird's body. Because there was a massive die-off of 73 of the
endangered birds due to botulism poison late last year and early this year,
Wang reported the first death to the Tainan Animal Disease Control Center
immediately.
Tainan began regular monitoring of the wetlands in June 2003 to avoid a
repeat of last year's poisoning deaths. Each year, a large number of
black-faced spoonbills migrate from the Korean Peninsula and north eastern
mainland China to Tainan County to overwinter. Last year was the first time
the birds died en masse at the wetlands.

[Birds die during migrations. But as this might just herald a second
botulism outbreak, it is being posted as a warning, a request to be alert.
Unfortunately it seems from this account that the death was merely reported
and the dead bird was not submitted for necropsy. One function of
ProMED-mail is to give warnings of emerging events, and this may be a false
alarm. - Mod.MHJ]
