China suffers outbreak of avian flu months after appearing to stamp out disease
-----------------------------------------------
China reported a new outbreak of bird flu on Tue 7 Jul 2004, and
Thailand said it had a suspected case; signs of a return of the
highly contagious disease that health experts fear could sicken
humans.
It was China's 1st report of the avian illness since it declared it
had "stamped out" the disease nearly 4 months ago. Tests at a farm in
the southeastern province of Anhui have that confirmed chickens died
of bird flu, the government said on state-run television.
In Thailand, authorities said they suspect a new outbreak of bird flu
at a farm in the central province of Ayutthaya. Thousands of chickens
at the farm have died.
Bird flu has also been confirmed on farms in Viet Nam in recent days.
Although the newest cases have affected only poultry, health experts
have said they fear bird flu might mutate and spread from person to
person. At its height earlier in 2004, the disease ravaged flocks
throughout Asia. It also spread from birds to humans in Viet Nam and
Thailand, killing 24 people. About 100 million chickens across the
region were slaughtered to halt its spread. China declared it had
defeated the disease in March 2004, after killing 9 million chickens
and other poultry. But, it warned that the disease might come back
with warmer weather.
"It's not surprising that it has come back," said Roy Wadia of the
World Health Organization in Beijing. "It stays in the environment a
long time."
The farm, in the city of Chaohu near a lake of the same name, has
been quarantined, China Central Television said. Authorities killed
all the poultry within 3 kilometers of the affected farm and
vaccinated poultry within 5 kilometers, the report said. It said the
outbreak was under control. "I think the experience that China had
several months ago has prepared it well," Wadia said.
In Hong Kong, which maintains border controls with mainland China,
the government said it was suspending live bird and poultry imports
from Anhui province.
Wadia said the UN agency was monitoring China's outbreak as well as
other cases in Asia.
The Thai case, if confirmed, would be the country's 2nd outbreak
since the government declared on 14 May 2004 that it was all but
certain Thailand was free of the disease.
"I have received reports that there are suspected bird flu cases in
Ayutthaya province, and the results of lab tests will be confirmed in
the next couple of days," Deputy Agriculture Minister Newin Chidchob
said.
An outbreak in Chiang Mai province in late May 2004 also raised
alarms. Chickens at the farm in Ayutthaya began to die about 2 weeks
ago, said farm owner Veera Sripramong. Officials ordered him to kill
all of his 43 000 chickens. "But I don't have enough manpower, so I
will do what I can," Veera said. He said about 7000 chickens have
died in the past 2 weeks.
Viet Nam last week [1st week Jul 2004] issued an emergency directive
urging local governments to prevent a major bird flu epidemic in the
wake of new outbreaks in the Mekong Delta.

New bird flu case confirmed in east China
-----------------------------------------------
The national bird flu reference laboratory confirmed, on Tue 6 Jul
2004, that the latest death of chickens in east China's Anhui
province was caused by the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu virus. The
case happened at a chicken farm of the Juchao District, Chaohu City,
east Anhui Province.
Officials with the Ministry of Agriculture said that the ministry
received the report of chicken death on 3 Jul 2004 and soon
dispatched a group of experts to the affected area to guide the
relevant work of prevention and control of the disease. Sources from
the ministry said that the local government has taken the necessary
measures of slaughter, or quarantine to prevent a spread, and sent
samples to the authorities. It has also isolated the area following
the death report in accordance with China's Lawon Animal Epidemic
Prevention. The local health authority killed all the poultry within
a 3 km radius of the chicken farm and vaccinated all the poultry
within a 5 km radius of the affected area.
Experts of the ministry said the farm is located on a slope, in a
separate environment, close to the wide Chaohu Lake, and all the
chicks are bought from the local markets, where no avian flu case had
been reported before. The experts estimated that the virus might be
spread by migrants or wild water birds.
The ministry has informed the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
of the United Nations, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the
relevant authorities of Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan about the case.
The ministry confirmed the 1st contraction of the H5N1 strain of bird
flu on 27 Jan 2004 at a duck farm in the Dingdang Township, south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
On 16 Mar 2004, the authority lifted quarantine on the last 2
affected areas in Lhasa of Tibet and Nanning, Guangxi's capital city.
During the period of time, 49 cases of bird flu altogether were
confirmed and controlled. So far, no human contraction has been
reported.

[Clearly, the current problems associated with avian influenza in
Eastern Asia are not over yet. Viet Nam, Cambodia, and, now, China
are reporting fresh outbreaks. There are also reports of an upswing
of cases in Thailand and Indonesia.
When an epidemic becomes a low-level smoldering fire in animal
populations, you can rest assured that new flocks or herds will serve
as fresh fuel, and the epidemic will surge. That is why it is so
important to stamp out the disease and to maintain very vigorous
surveillance for ample periods of time after apparent freedom from
disease.
Let's hope that this will be a typical mopping-up operation aimed at
a few stray bird farms. However, the occurrence of new outbreaks from
so many different countries, within the span of a few days, may
indicate another round in the struggle to truly rid East Asian
poultry of this highly pathogenic influenza virus. - Mod.PC]
[Data on the vaccine applied as a post-infection control measure in
China (homologous?) and the full identity of the virus described as
H5 in Thailand will be helpful. - Mod. AS].
