More than 100 people have been infected in an outbreak of norovirus infection at a Yokohama hospital [Kanagawa Prefecture] according to the municipal authorities on Mon 31 Dec 2012. A total of 112 people, including 82 patients and 30 members of staff at Yokohama Denentoshi Hospital contracted gastroenteritis caused by norovirus infection up to the morning of 31 Dec 2012, according to officials quoted by Japan's Kyodo News.

This outbreak of disease probably caused the deaths of 4 seniors in the hospital on 31 Dec 2012, who died as a result of breathing problems [in addition to] the characteristic norovirus infection symptoms of vomiting and diarrhoea. The officials said local government inspectors investigated the hospital on 4 occasions to try to establish the route of infection, and Japan's Health Ministry has urged local government officials to deal with the source of the infection without delay.

Meanwhile, Maebashi city in Gunma Prefecture has reported the death of an elderly female patient in a nursing home who had tested positive for norovirus infection. About 17 others in this nursing home were also reported to have developed symptoms of vomiting and diarrhoea but otherwise were not in serious condition.

[As elsewhere in the Northern hemisphere, hospital and nursing home outbreaks of norovirus infection are frequent during the winter months. The frequency of fatalities may reflect a higher proportion of elderly patients receiving hospital care in Japan.
