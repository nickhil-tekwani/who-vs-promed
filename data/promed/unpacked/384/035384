>From November 1996 to 22 February 1997, 1659 cases of cerebrospinal
meningitis with 281 deaths (Case-fatality rate 17%) were reported, most of
which (70%) occurred in February 1997. The outbreak started in East Mamprusi
district and Bawku East and then spread to four other districts in Upper West
Region. The population at greatest risk is estimated at around 1.7 million
but the entire population at risk in the Upper East and Northern Regions is
close to 3 million. Reports indicate that the number of cases is increasing
rapidly in other districts of the Upper East, Northern, Upper West and Brong
Ahafo Regions. The total population exposed in these Regions is near 5.5
million. The Ministry of Health has mobilized funds to purchase at least
3,395,000 doses of vaccines with needles and syringes.

Outbreaks have also been reported in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Togo,
continuing the epidemic cycle which started in West Africa in 1996. The
presence of serogroup A _Neisseria meningitidis_ has been confirmed.

The appeal launched by WHO, UNICEF, Medecins sans Frontiere, Federation of
Red Cross, and Red Crescent Societies on 7 February resulted in pledges
exceeding US$ 3 million for the response to the threat of epidemic meningitis
in Africa. The appeal is being relaunched on 7 March to reach the goal of
US$ 6.3 million needed to secure the purchase and distribution of vaccine,
drugs for treatment and injection material.
