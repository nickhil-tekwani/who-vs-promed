United Kingdom: increasing influenza B virus activity
-----------------------------------------------------
The Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) has received the first
reports for the 2002-3 season, of outbreaks of influenza-like illness, all
of which have occurred in schools. Positive detections of influenza B virus
have been reported from three cases, in the south of England, during weeks
4 and 5 (week ending Sun 2 Feb 2003). Attack rates have ranged from 15 per
cent to 58 per cent. Additional reports of outbreaks have since been
received from the north of England where influenza activity has been
detected in several schools through the monitoring of school sickness
absence rates.
Overall this season in the United Kingdom (UK), both laboratory detections
and clinical indicators for influenza have been low, with influenza B virus
comprising the majority of laboratory reports. Indicators in England,
however, in the last few weeks from both the Royal College of General
Practitioners (RCGP) weekly returns sentinel service for consultation rates
for influenza-like illness and calls to the NHS Direct [telephone advisory
service] for "cold/flu", have shown an increase in the 5 to 14 year age
group for week 4, suggesting rising influenza B virus activity in children.
Influenza B virus traditionally causes milder symptoms than influenza A
virus and commonly affects the younger age groups.
This season, in Europe and the United States, influenza B virus has also
been the major influenza virus in circulation. Confirmation of the
virological cause of outbreaks of influenza-like illness, and other
outbreaks of acute respiratory illness, may be of value in the management
of the local outbreak, while contributing to the surveillance of influenza
virus strains that may be relevant for future vaccine composition.

[Influenza B virus infection appears to be widespread now throughout Europe
and the Americas (see references below), and perhaps also in the Far East.
On Sun 2 Feb 2003 ProMED-mail received a report originating from Yomiuri
Shimbun <http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/20030202wo34.htm>, relayd by Waldyr
Milagres Junior <milagres@fclnet.com.br>, reporting an extensive influenza
epidemic affecting 3667 schools in Japan, with a three-fold increase over
the number of cases recorded in the previous week. According to a
nationwide survey of nurseries, kindergartens, primary and middle schools,
about 129 000 children had suffered from influenza as of 25 Jan 2003, up
about 89 000 from the previous week's survey and about 10 times as many
cases compared with the corresponding period last year. The etiologic agent
was not identified, but it seems likely that influenza B virus is
responsible. - Mod.CP]
