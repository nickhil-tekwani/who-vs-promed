>As the gentleman mentions, baseline incidence of _Salmonella_ in poultry
is known to be high, ~ 30-50% in prior years (although it's low in beef,
with ~ 1-2% prevalence on carcasses).
The method used to culture poultry carcasses has been the whole carcass
rinse method as compared to the swabbing of a couple square inches of a
beef carcass. It is not scientifically sound to compare incidence or
prevalence when two totally different methods of testing are used.
On a similar note, it is not reasonable to expect animals processed with
the skin on (poultry) to be free of fecal organisms. The purpose of
processing is to reduce the bacterial load of the animal not eliminate it;
the purpose of cooking is to eliminate the bacterial risk. Somehow we've
reached the point where people are being led to believe that raw product
should be free of bacteria and that is just not going to happen!
