Cattle vaccines out of stock
----------------------------
The vaccination of cattle in the districts affected by foot-and-mouth
disease [FMD] has stalled due to absence of vaccines, the agriculture
ministry has said. "Until the finance ministry releases money, the
suppliers cannot dispatch the vaccines," said Dr Nicholas Kauta, the
commissioner for livestock health and entomology.

Sources in the agriculture ministry told The New Vision that the
Government recently ordered 300 000 doses of FMD vaccines to control
the disease in the northern and eastern districts.

Towards the end of 2008 and early this year [2009], veterinary
authorities in northern Uganda closed butcheries and livestock
markets in the districts of Lira, Apac, Amuru, Amolatar, Pader,
Dokolo, Abim, and Oyam [in the Northern region], and Katakwi and
Kaberamaido [in the Eastern region].

This followed the outbreak of the disease, which left at least 300
head of cattle dead. Kauta said in addition to the quarantine, the
Government was sensitising the farmers.

"The condition is stable. The disease has remained only in the areas
where it was reported. Our main control measure now is quarantine,
although some people sneak out with the animals," he said.

"Some herds at the border with Tanzania in Rakai [Central region]
were also found to be sick. This is common in January and February
each year, because some animals cross over," he added. Kampala
district veterinary officer Dr Bariyanga Ahimbisibwe said although
the district was still free from the disease, precautionary measures
would continue.

FMD is a viral disease affecting hoofed animals such as cattle, water
buffalos, sheep, goats, and pigs.
