FOOD SAFETY, NEW INITIATIVE - USA
=================================
Date: Mon, 12 May 1997

------------------------------
A new food safety initiative spurred by recent outbreaks of foodborne
pathogens in the United States was announced by Vice President Al Gore, who
said that "when a child reaches for a piece of food, it ought to be safe."
Main points of the initiative that will rest on a cooperative framework
involving FDA, USDA, CDC, HHS and EPS are:
1. More inspectors, especially for seafood
2. Extending food inspection to fruit and vegetable juices
3. $16.5 million for research on new tests, including Hepatitis A and
Cyclospora not now detectable in foods
4. Re-examination of microbial resistance to traditional modes of
preserving food, e.g., heat and refrigeration
5. An 8th sentinel site to be added to CDC's early warning system
6. Technology to be made more generally availabe for tracking down
infections, including DNA fingerprinting.
The vice president also called upon citizens to take more care in personal
hygiene (e.g. hand washing) and food preparation (e.g. washing fruits and
vegetables and safe handling of meat products), and government agencies to
provide more public education on these issues.

VICE PRESIDENT RELEASES PLAN TO STRENGTHEN, IMPROVE FOOD SAFETY
Calls For Stricter Precautions For Fruit & Vegetable Juices, Improved
Inspections

WASHINGTON -- Vice President Gore today (5/12) announced a five-point plan
to
significantly increase the safety of the nation's food supply. The plan sets
forth steps the Administration will take this year to strengthen food safety
and details how we will use $43.2 million in new funds the President has
requested in his fiscal year 1998 budget.
"When children reach for a piece of food, parents deserve to have peace of
mind," said the Vice President who heads the National Performance Review to
make government work better and cost less. "This Administration is using the
most modern science and a common-sense approach to increase the safety of our
nation's food supply and protect the public health."
The plan, "Food Safety From Farm to Table," is outlined in a report
presented
to the Vice President today by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E.
Shalala, Department of Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, and Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator Carol M. Browner. The President requested
the
report in January. It calls for improved inspections, public education and
greater use of the latest science to dramatically reduce foodborne illness.
It
calls for stricter safety precautions for fruit and vegetable juices,
improved
seafood inspections, and increased investment in research, risk assessment
and
surveillance.

In his January 25 radio address, the President announced he was requesting
$43.2 million for food safety in his FY 1998 budget and requested a report
detailing recommendations on ways to further improve food safety. The
Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services, and the
Environmental
Protection Agency, working with state and local officials, the food industry,
scientists, consumer, and producer groups, developed the report.
Today's actions build on previous Administration steps to modernize the
nation's food safety programs, first proposed by the Vice President's
National Performance Review. Specifically, the National Performance Review
encouraged the widespread adoption of preventive controls to food safety, and
the implementation of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP)
systems.
A key element of the Administration's food safety efforts has been the
Hazard
Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) approach that requires the food
industry to use the most modern science to identify sources of potential
contamination in food production and transportation and then put in place
preventive measures. Already required by the Food and Drug Administration
for
seafood and by USDA for meat and poultry, FDA will propose preventive
measures,
including HACCP, for the manufacture of fruit and vegetable juice products,
and
USDA will propose HACCP and other appropriate regulatory and non-regulatory
options for egg products.
In addition to moving toward a science-based, preventive approach to food
safety, the Administration continues to improve the effectiveness of food
safety inspections. Specifically, the additional funds requested for FY 1998
will allow the FDA to add inspectors to implement seafood HACCP and to expand
its program to develop additional mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) with
United States trading partners ensuring that imported foods are produced and
manufactured under systems that offer comparable safety measures to those
used
in the United States. With the new funds, FDA will also be able to provide
technical assistance to foreign countries on safe growing and handling
practices.
The Administration already is taking steps to put in place the new National
Early Warning System President Clinton announced in January to track and
combat
outbreaks of foodborne illness. This fiscal year, two new FoodNet sentinel
sites were added in New York and Maryland. With funds requested for the
upcoming fiscal year, an eighth site will open. This surveillance system is
supported by the CDC, FDA and USDA, working with state authorities. New
funds
included in the FY 1998 budget will also allow these sites to update
technology
and build a "fingerprinting" database of bacterial DNA. This will enable
food
safety experts to clear any geographic hurdle to their work by having a
national resource that can help them quickly identify contaminated foods that
are the sources of foodborne illness.
Under the Administration's plan, work will start immediately on a national
public education campaign on safe food handling. Today, an unprecedented
public-private partnership was established among government agencies and
industry and consumer groups to develop a food safety education campaign
aimed
at consumers.
Research to develop quick, reliable scientific methods for detecting
contamination -- like the Hepatitis A virus and cyclospora -- will ensure
that
public health agencies have the necessary tools to prevent and control
outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. The latest research will also explore how
pathogens become resistant to traditional food preservation techniques such
as
heat and refrigeration, and will support new pathogen control methods.
Also under the new initiative, EPA, FDA and the CDC will collaborate with
state and local health departments on research to help health officials
better
predict and control outbreaks of waterborne microbial contaminants, such as
cryptosporidium.
