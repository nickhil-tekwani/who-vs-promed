Health care providers must encourage equitable access to COVID-19 antiviral treatments
-------------------------------------------------------
People who may be most in need of antiviral treatment for COVID-19 may not receive it because of where they live, according to a recent report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study showed that doses of antivirals molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) dispensed were lowest in "high-vulnerability" ZIP codes, despite these ZIP codes having the largest number of dispensing sites.

The federal government, health care systems, public health officials and clinicians need to take additional steps to ensure equitable access to these antiviral therapies. These include:
• Ensuring everyone who tests positive for COVID-19 can be quickly connected with a clinician who can evaluate whether they would benefit from an antiviral and prescribe one if appropriate.
• Heightening efforts to reach underserved, high-risk communities, including through telehealth, mobile clinics, co-locating testing and access to therapeutics, and increasing support for community health centers and other clinics and pharmacies located in underserved communities.
• Expanding clinician education, focusing on clinicians who care for underserved communities, so all frontline providers have information they need to appropriately prescribe antivirals and manage drug interactions.
• Partnering with trusted community-based organizations in underserved communities to expand public education to increase awareness of the benefits of antivirals and the importance of contacting a health care provider right away upon a positive test result.
• Ensuring that accurate and up-to-date information is available on where and how to access antivirals with a focus on underserved communities.

Longstanding health inequities continue to hamper our COVID-19 response, and we must redouble our commitment to health equity to ensure that everyone with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms at risk for progression to severe disease has access to antiviral therapies.

Discussion
This analysis of national oral antiviral dispensing data during 23 Dec 2021-21 May 2022, highlights a substantial increase in the number of dispensing sites located throughout the country to 39 687 sites (87% of which were pharmacies) as of 21 May 2022, and in the number of oral antivirals dispensed (1 076 762 total, including 70.3% during 7 Mar-21 May 2022). These increases were possible because of coordinated efforts among federal, state, local, and pharmacy partners to expand access to COVID-19 therapies, coincident with an increased supply and a rise in the number COVID-19 cases nationwide. Efforts to expand oral antiviral access included the launch of the Test to Treat program, an expansion of the distribution network through federal pharmacy partners, increased access to testing, and ongoing implementation of community and clinician outreach efforts.

Despite the increase in the number of oral antivirals dispensed during the study period, population-adjusted dispensing rates in high-vulnerability zip codes were substantially lower than those in medium- and low-vulnerability zip codes, even though high-vulnerability zip codes had the most dispensing sites. Oral antivirals, particularly Paxlovid, provide an essential tool that can prevent hospitalization and death from COVID-19 (5). The findings in this report highlight an ongoing need to identify and eliminate barriers to oral antiviral access, particularly within socially and economically disadvantaged communities.

Timely administration of oral antivirals depends on multiple factors, including adequate drug supply and distribution; acceptance of the therapy by health care providers and the public; and patient access to testing, prescriptions, and drug dispensing sites (6). To access oral antiviral therapy, a patient must first receive a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), followed by a clinical assessment by a health care provider authorized to prescribe the drug (i.e., physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and physician assistants). Although 47.5% of dispensing sites are located in high-vulnerability zip codes as of 21 May 2022, and approximately 88% of the U.S. population live within 5 miles [8 km] of a site, most pharmacies serving as dispensing sites do not have authorized prescribers available on-site or via telemedicine. Persons living in high-vulnerability zip codes might face challenges accessing health care providers who are authorized to prescribe oral antivirals (1). In addition, the end of reimbursement for testing, health care provider assessment, and oral antiviral dispensing through the Health Resources and Services Administration Uninsured Program on 22 Mar 2022, might have contributed to lower oral antiviral dispensing rates for certain populations living within high-vulnerability zip codes.

Several strategies could improve access to oral antivirals in high-vulnerability zip codes. Additional innovative approaches could be considered that facilitate patient access to testing, clinical assessments, and oral antivirals in a single visit (6). As access to prescriptions increases, provider reimbursements for clinical assessment services should be considered, including additional costs that might inadvertently create additional barriers to care. Additional needed efforts, with an emphasis on reaching high-vulnerability areas, include increasing access to authorized prescribers; continuing education and outreach for patients, reinforcing the importance of seeking medication early after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms; and continued expansion of oral antiviral dispensing sites nationwide. Health care providers should be aware that Paxlovid is generally well-tolerated, is highly effective at preventing severe disease and hospitalization, and should be prescribed to treat mild to moderate illness in persons who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including persons aged ≥ 65 years. ...

[2] Reinfection

ref: Ziyad Al-Aly, Benjamin Bowe, Yan Xie et al. Outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, 17 Jun 2022, PREPRINT (Version 1) available at Research Square
---------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
First infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with increased risk of acute and post-acute death and sequelae in the pulmonary and extrapulmonary organ systems. However, whether reinfection adds to the risk incurred after the first infection is not clear. Here we use the national health care databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs to build a cohort of people with first infection (n = 257 427), reinfection (2 or more infections, n = 38 926), and a non-infected control group (n = 5 396 855) to estimate risks and 6-month burdens of all-cause mortality, hospitalization, and a set of pre-specified incident outcomes. We show that compared to people with first infection, reinfection contributes additional risks of all-cause mortality, hospitalization, and adverse health outcomes in the pulmonary and several extrapulmonary organ systems (cardiovascular disorders, coagulation and hematologic disorders, diabetes, fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders, kidney disorders, mental health disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and neurologic disorders); the risks were evident in those who were unvaccinated, had 1 shot, or 2 or more shots prior to the second infection; the risks were most pronounced in the acute phase, but persisted in the post-acute phase of reinfection, and most were still evident at 6 months after reinfection. Compared to non-infected controls, assessment of the cumulative risks of repeated infection showed that the risk and burden increased in a graded fashion according to the number of infections. The constellation of findings show that reinfection adds non-trivial risks of all-cause mortality, hospitalization, and adverse health outcomes in the acute and post-acute phase of the reinfection. Reducing overall burden of death and disease due to SARS-CoV-2 will require strategies for reinfection prevention.

Discussion
... For the large and growing number of people who encountered a 1st infection, the question of whether a 2nd infection carries additional risk is important. In this work, we show that reinfection adds risk of all-cause mortality and adverse health outcomes in both the acute phase and the post-acute phase of reinfection -- suggesting that for people who already infected once, continued vigilance to reduce risk of reinfection may be important to reduce overall risk to one's health.

Given the likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 will remain a threat for years if not decades, we urgently need to develop public health measures that would be embraced by the public and could be sustainably implemented in the long-term to protect people from reinfection. Pharmaceutical interventions to lessen both the risk of reinfection and its adverse health consequences are also urgently needed.

Questions have been raised whether reinfection increases the risk of Long COVID -- the umbrella term encompassing the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results show that beyond the acute phase, reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 contributes substantial additional risks of all-cause mortality, hospitalization, and post-acute sequelae in the pulmonary and broad array of pulmonary organ systems.

The mechanisms underpinning the increased risks of death and adverse health outcomes in reinfection are not completely clear. Prior exposure to the virus may be expected to hypothetically reduce risk of reinfection and its severity; however, SARS-CoV-2 is mutating rapidly, and new variants are replacing older ones every few months. Evidence suggests that the reinfection risk is especially higher with the omicron variant which was shown to have a marked ability to evade immunity from prior infection. And any protection from infection also wanes over time; protection from reinfection declined as the time increased since the last immunity-conferring event in people who had previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (regardless of vaccination status).

Furthermore, impaired health as a consequence of the 1st infection might result in increased risk of adverse health consequences upon reinfection. Our results expand this evidence base and show that reinfection adds risk in both the acute and post-acute phase and that this was evident even among fully vaccinated people -- suggesting that even combined natural immunity (from prior infection) and vaccine-induced immunity does not abrogate risk of adverse health effects following reinfection. The totality of evidence suggests that prevention strategies of reinfection might benefit people regardless of prior history of infection and vaccination status. ...

In sum, in this study of 5 693 208 we provide evidence that reinfection contributes additional health risks beyond those incurred in the 1st infection including all-cause mortality, hospitalization, and sequelae in the pulmonary and broad array of extrapulmonary organ systems. The risks were evident in the acute and post-acute phase of reinfection. The evidence suggests that for people who already had a 1st infection, prevention of a 2nd infection may protect from additional health risks. Prevention of infection and reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 should continue to be the goal of public health policy.

[3] COVID-19 update (145): immune response, Paxlovid, WHO 20220624.8704045 correction
Date: Fri 24 Jun 2022
Submitted by: Allen Lenoir [edited]


[According to a CIDRAP report in ProMED. COVID-19 update (145): immune response, Paxlovid, WHO 20220624.8704045: [1] Immune response [A] Moderna booster] "Moderna said the bivalent booster upped neutralizing antibodies 5.4-fold against BA.4 and BA.5, above baseline in all participants, regardless of prior infections, with a 6.3-fold increase in a group of seronegative participants -- those showing evidence of past infection. One month after receiving the bivalent booster, neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs) against BA.4 and BA.5 were 941 in all participants and 727 in the seronegative group."

This must be a typo, but which way? Seronegative means they are not showing evidence of past infection, they must mean the titer seropositive patients had a 6.3 fold increase compared to 5.4 in all participants, since they say the titer was 941 for all and 727 for the seronegative group, although they could have meant seropositive in the last sentence above.

It's unclear. Seropositive might give higher titers since infection could act as an extra booster, or could give lower titers because of original antigenic sin.

The CIDRAP report has the added clause "those showing evidence of past infection". The original Moderna press release does not.

[ProMED thanks Allen Lenoir for pointing out this discrepancy, which is a misprint either by CIDRAP in adding the clause "those showing evidence of past infection" in regard to seronegative participants, which is incorrect; or by Moderna, in writing "seronegative" instead of "seropositive". See Moderna's press release, which lacks the clause (https://bit.ly/3OlxTZh). There is no way of knowing without seeing the data, but it is more likely that Moderna's original report stating seronegative people was what was intended, which would mean those showing no evidence of past infection. - Mod.LK]
