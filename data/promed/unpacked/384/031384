The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in swans was confirmed at a plot in De Kroon on [Mon 19 Mar 2018], the Department of Rural, Environment and Agricultural Development said in a statement to private veterinary practices. Quarantine has been imposed on the plot on which the outbreak occurred, with biosecurity instructions and regular monitoring. Other prescribed outbreak controls are currently under way on the outbreak site as well as the surroundings.

The department said commercial poultry farmers closer to the facility have been made aware of the current HPAI outbreak. Private veterinarians in and around Brits have been alerted to the outbreak. Veterinary clinics have advised clients that due to the outbreak they can unfortunately for the time being not allow the admission of sick poultry or any wild birds on their premises. However, veterinary clinics can still dispense medicine.

[The HPAI virus that has recently been circulating in South Africa is H5N8. Control measures have halted the outbreaks in poultry (the last one was in October 2017), but this report suggests that the virus may still be circulating in the region.
