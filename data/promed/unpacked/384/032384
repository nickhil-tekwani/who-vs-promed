Owls [_Surnia ulula_, picture at
<http://www.schmoker.org/BirdPics/Photos/Owls/NOHO58.jpg>]
born in May 2006 after the last vaccination of the zoo animals. The
1st 3 animals had their initial clinical signs on 27 Jul 2006, 31 Jul
2006 & 7 Aug 2006, respectively. These birds died on 9 Aug 2006,
triggering the investigation. On 10 Aug 2006, the 4th bird got sick.

[The above addition to the background information on this case is
welcomed. According to (Dutch) press reports, the zoo has no idea
about the possible source of infection. The press further says import
from Asia would have been illegal, but is not fully ruled out. The
final results of the laboratory tests and of the epidemiological
investigations into the source of infection are anticipated with
interest. - Mod. AS/JW].
