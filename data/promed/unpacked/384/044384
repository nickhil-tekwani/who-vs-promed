re: Monkeypox - Africa (02): Central African Republic (HK) 20180321.5700108
----------------------------------------------------------
The WHO Africa Weekly Bulletin on Outbreaks and Other Emergencies Week 11 is misleading, specifically because there is no mention of Ippy -- where the cases originated from.

On [17 Mar 2018], the World Health Organization in Central Africa Republic [CAR] twitter account posted the following "RCA health minister Dr Somse today declared an outbreak of monkeypox. In total, 8 cases, all from the sub-prefecture of Ippy: of these, 3 cases are quarantined at the hospital in Bria, 5 are suspected cases in Ippy and 2 cases would still be on the IDP site of the Catholic Church" (see Source 1). So 3 of the cases from Ippy are receiving care in the town of Bria, Haute-Kotto Prefecture, approximately 93 km [approx.58 mi] east of Ippy.

The WHO Africa Weekly Bulletin is correct that 2 confirmed cases have been reported. However, these 2 confirmed cases are from Ippy per a press release from the Institut Pasteur Bangui posted on [12 Mar 2018] (see Source 2).

There was also a media report that came out on [13 Mar 2018] that talked about a possible case at an IDP site in Bria (see Source 3). However, the tweet from the WHO in CAR on [17 Mar 2018] clarifies that all the cases have been reported in Ippy. The cases reported in Ippy, Ouaka Prefecture are significant because it appears that this is the 1st time cases have been reported in this prefecture.

Monkeypox becomes a public health threat in the Central African Republic (CAR). For the 3rd year in a row, cases of monkeypox virus infection have been confirmed in the 1st quarter of the year in southeastern CAR. The Pasteur Institute of Bangui has just confirmed 2 cases of infection with monkeypox virus in the sub-prefecture of Ippy (Ouka Prefecture) in the south east of the CAR [based] on blood samples and more sent by the WHO focal point representative, Dr Ars√®ne Dominique Konzelo.

The 1st case, a 29 year old fisherman from Djama Ngoundji village, had a rash all over his body. All he knows is that he was in contact with fish infected with _Aphanomyces invadans_ that had ulcerations on its body (unrelated to the monkeypox infection). The 2nd case, a 50 year old woman living in Kopia village on the IDP site, also had a rash all over her body, except for the palms of her hands. Investigations are under way to try to understand the source of the infections.

[The body of the report is essentially the same as that of Source 2, with the following additions:]
Humanitarian sources have learned that another case of monkeypox was discovered at a displaced person's site in Bria near Ippy last week. All 3 cases are still under medical supervision at the Bria hospital.

This is the 5th time monkeypox has appeared in the Central African Republic. The 1st time was in Mbomou in 2001, the 2nd time in Haute Kotto in 2014, in 2016, and in 2017 and this time in 2018 in Ouaka and Haute-Kott.

[The above and previous reports are the 1st of monkeypox cases in the Central African Republic (CAR) that ProMED-mail has posted. However, as the above report indicates, monkeypox (MPX) cases have been diagnosed in the country on 5 previous occasions over the past 17 years. The MPX virus clade involved in this outbreak and the one in Nigeria is not mentioned. With just one reported fatality in Nigeria, and that one in an immunosuppressed individual, the West Africa clade may be the one involved in this outbreak. That clade has the lowest case fatality rate.

The question remains about the source of these infections within Nigeria and now in the CAR. One wonders if there is a MPX virus epizootic going on in rodent hosts across a relatively wide geographic area. Studies of prevalence of MPX virus in rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope (or striped) squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_.

ProMED-mail thanks Melissa Dudley for providing this addition information and clarifying the extent of this MPX outbreak. - Mod.TY
