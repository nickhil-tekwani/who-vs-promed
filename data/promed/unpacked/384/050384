A 23-year old woman from Viqueque died from Japanese encephalitis on
Tuesday last week in what is believed to be the first documented case of
the disease in East Timor. A 12-year old child is currently being treated
for the disease at the Medecins Sans Frontieres France hospital in Viqueque.
These are the first documented cases of the disease in humans in East
Timor, according to the World Health Organization. The organization is
planning, together with the Interim Health Authority and health NGOs, a
strategy for a vaccination campaign for those most at risk. Other
preventive measures include the distribution of insecticide treated bed nets.
Antibodies for Japanese encephalitis were found in one blood sample from a
pig in Viqueque in February. Samples from a total of 24 pigs and 20
chickens were collected in Dili and other districts. The final results came
to WHO in April.
The virus is rare among humans but according to WHO the disease is fatal in
25-40% of the cases. WHO highly recommends that continued precautions be
made to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, which transmit [Japanese
encephalitis virus, dengue viruses and malarial organisms.

Japanese encephalitis, for us, is not a surprise in East Timor. Very
strange was the absence of the disease in such poor, primitive and dramatic
conditions. Cases have been described in tourists coming from Bali (1) and
even in more western territories like western Irian Jaya (2). Pigs,
appropriate _Culex_ sp. mosquitoes and intense rainy season are all we
need to suspect the presence of the disease.
As a preventive measure, Portuguese military forces in East Timor were
immunised against Japanese encephalitis, included in the basic pre-travel
preparation.
