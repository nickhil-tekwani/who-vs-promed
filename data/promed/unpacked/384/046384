The health authorities of Aracatuba [Sao Paulo state] are issuing an alert
about an epidemic of human visceral leishmaniasis in 30 municipalities of
the region. In 2002, epidemiological surveillance reported 43 cases in
humans resulting in 4 deaths; there were also 2 deaths in 2001. These
deaths have led to the development of a strategic plan for disease control
by the Superintendence of Endemic Disease Control (Sucen).
As of Friday [10 Jan 2003], the Epidemiological Surveillance Unit confirmed
the first death this year [2003] attributable to visceral leishmaniasis,
signifying the 11th death due to this disease since its reappearance in the
region in the summer of 1998. The most recent death [2003] is in an adult male.
The Epidemiological Surveillance Unit will investigate whether the death
was due to leishmaniasis or whether the disease was aggravated by an
underlying chronic cirrhosis (liver disease). Most cases have been in
children, especially those living in lower socioeconomic neighborhoods, due
to underlying malnutrition and an association with other diseases such as
pneumonia.
Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by the protozoan _Leishmania_ spp. and is
transmitted by sand flies, which preferentially feed on dogs. For this
reason, disease control is primarily directed at the canine population.
Sucen is testing a type of collar with a mosquito repellant. About 10 000
dogs have been registered [by census] and are followed in Andradina, and
another 2000 in Aracatuba.

[The species of leishmania implicated is _L.chagasi_ and the vectors are
_Lutzomyia_ spp. The animal reservoir includes dogs, foxes, and opossums.
In 1999, 3892 human cases were reported in Brazil, 3200 of which were in
the north eastern states (www.gideon.com), but the prevalence in Sao Paulo
state is not known. Leishmania is one of the infections that increase
following an increase in HIV prevalence. - Mod.EP]
