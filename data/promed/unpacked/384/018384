A dangerous hantavirus is spreading in Baden-Wurttemberg. Since the
beginning of the year [2010], 85 cases have been reported in the
administrative district of Stuttgart, the regional council announced on
Wednesday [24 Feb 2010].

The number is unusually high for the season and exceeded the previous
record year of 2007 with 41 cases in the same period, it said. This leaves
an expectation of high infection levels in the coming months. The [number
of] cases have been piling up since December [2009].

According to [health] information, hantavirus disease [in this part of
Europe] manifests itself usually in the form of a common cold with sudden
onset and high fever. In addition, [infected individuals] have head and
body aches and abdominal pain. The illness lasts about 3 weeks and more
than half of those affected are hospitalized. Some patients develop kidney
failure. A vaccine does not exist.

Hantaviruses are [maintained in] wild rodents that spread the virus
primarily through faeces and urine. Humans usually become infected by
inhaling dust [with excreta having the] pathogen. [The red-backed vole,
_Myodes] glareolus_, whose principal food is beechnuts, is the main reservoir.

Regions with a high prevalence are Swabian Alb and Schoenbuch, which are
the most affected. The current incidence is probably due to a particularly
high population of red-backed voles.
