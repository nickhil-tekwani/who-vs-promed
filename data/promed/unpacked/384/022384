Japan has confirmed the 1st case of cancer linked to the Fukushima nuclear reactor leak, more than 4 years after the disaster.

A former employee at the facility, which was damaged in the magnitude 9 earthquake that devastated parts of the country in March 2011, has been diagnosed with radiation-linked leukemia.

Japan's labour ministry released a statement saying the man was in his 30s and is being awarded compensation, according to a translation by NHK World.

The Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, said more than 44 000 people have worked to decommission the facility.

It was hit by the earthquake and huge tsunami that caused damage leading to a series of meltdowns and the release of radioactive materials in the largest nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.

The accident was classed at the highest level on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale but no deaths were immediately linked to radiation exposure.

Thousands of local people fled their homes when exclusion zones were set up by the government in the aftermath of the disaster, although local authorities did not order evacuations in some areas for several weeks.

A report completed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2013 found that for the "general population" inside Japan and beyond, risks from radiation were low and "no observable increases in cancer rates" were anticipated.

The risk of leukaemia was expected to increase by 7 percent for children in the most contaminated locations and 1/3 of emergency workers who went inside the plant were forecast to be at a heightened risk of developing cancer.

Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director for Public Health and Environment, said at the time: "A breakdown of data, based on age, gender, and proximity to the nuclear plant, does show a higher cancer risk for those located in the most contaminated parts."

[While this is the 1st reported case of cancer, there are many reports of increases in thyroid cancer in children of the Fukushima area. There are also concerning reports that it may not be linked to the nuclear situation in Japan in 2011.

Radiation is capable of producing cancers, and may be linked to various sources of radiation. However, in the case in the article it is likely it is from the nuclear power plant.

Radiation damage to cells in the body can happen after a person receives radiation therapy to treat cancer. It can also happen if a person is exposed to radiation through x-ray imaging, nuclear power, or fallout from nuclear weapons. If severe enough, radiation damage may cause cancer, birth defects, heart disease, and other serious health problems. Doctors try to protect people undergoing radiation therapy for cancer by using low doses, being precise about targeting the radiation, and minimizing side effects. Usually side effects go away after the treatment stops when it regards a medical use of radiation. Whole body radiation, such as the person in the article received, may not experience clinical signs immediately. Signs tend to be immediate with higher doses and cancers with somewhat lower doses. - Mod.TG
