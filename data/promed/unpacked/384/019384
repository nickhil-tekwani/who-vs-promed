Doctors have examined about 6000 people in progress of anti-cholera efforts
in the Primorsky region, Russian Far East. Almost 5000 people are the
region's residents who have come back from tourist or business trips to
China, and 1000 are residents of the Khabarovsk territory or the Jewish
autonomy.
Another 150 people have been examined because of contacts with three men
diagnosed with cholera, a spokesman at the regional
sanitary-epidemiological center told Itar-Tass on Wednesday. The
anti-cholera measures will be in effect in the Primorsky region until
August 15.

The measures consist of tightened sanitary control of residential areas and
water reservoirs, medical checks of all who return from China, and the
limited traffic of people across the Russian-Chinese border.
The first cholera case was a driver who returned from China. Cholera was
diagnosed later in two other drivers who had been to China.
Epidemiologists are sure that the three cholera cases were imported from
China, although Chinese authorities do not confirm this. The regional
emergencies commission on August 15 will pass the decision on extension or
lifting of the anti-cholera measures.

[Are there any data supporting the cost effectiveness of this exercise?
Might the time and money be better spent on establishing a good active
surveillance system that would detect suspect cases earlier? This could be
combined with the preparation of educational materials for people returning
from the infected areas with advice to seek medical attention if they
developed symptoms, along with sensitizing the health care personnel to
include cholera in the differential diagnosis of gastroenteritis as well as
the need for immediate reporting of suspect cases. - MPP
