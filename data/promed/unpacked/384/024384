Influenza update no. 222
------------------------
Summary
-------
Globally, influenza activity remained low, with the exception of some tropical countries in the Americas and some Pacific Islands.

- In Europe and North America, overall influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.
- In tropical countries of the Americas, influenza B co-circulated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
- In Africa and western Asia, influenza activity was low.
- In eastern Asia, influenza activity in most countries remained low or decreased after some influenza A(H3N2) activity in August and September 2014.
- In tropical Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease or remain low, with influenza A(H3N2) predominant.
- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity decreased in general except in several Pacific Islands, where ILI activity remained high. In the temperate zone of South America, influenza-like illness (ILI) decreased and continued to be associated with RSV. Influenza A(H3N2) virus was the most frequently detected influenza virus. In Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity also decreased.
- The WHO recommendation on the composition of influenza vaccines for the southern hemisphere 2015 was announced on 25 Sep 2014. The recommendation and associated technical report are posted at the WHO website: http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/2015_south/en/.
- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 16 Oct 2014 16:05 UTC), during weeks 39 to 40 (21 Sep 2014 to 4 Oct 2014), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 53 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 34 991 specimens. 1465 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1001 (68.3 per cent) were typed as influenza A and 464 (31.7 per cent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 96 (12.9 per cent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 649 (87 per cent) were influenza A(H3N2) and one (0.1 per cent) was influenza A(H5). Of the characterized B viruses, 99 (99 per cent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and one (one per cent) to the B-Victoria lineage.
- Due to changes in data collection platforms, data from the WHO Regional Office for Europe are temporarily not available at global level. Those data will be uploaded to FluNet and FluID as soon as possible. Information on European influenza activity can be found at http://www.flunewseurope.org/.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America, Europe, Northern Africa and the Western and Central Asia region

In the countries in the northern hemisphere, overall influenza activity was at inter-seasonal levels. In the United States, influenza activity increased slightly but was still within expected levels for this time of year.

In Europe, influenza activity was low with some sporadic detections of influenza virus in Spain and the United Kingdom. From 17 countries in the European region, one per cent of 221 specimens tested positive for influenza.

Eastern Asia

In the eastern Asian region, influenza activity remained low with influenza A(H3N2) as the main virus in circulation.
In northern China, influenza activity was low and mainly due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. In Japan and the Republic of Korea, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels. In Mongolia, ILI activity increased with no indication of influenza activity.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean

Overall in this region, influenza activity was variable. Circulation of influenza B virus was reported from most of the Caribbean and central American countries, such as Costa Rica and Nicaragua. However, in most central American countries, circulation of influenza B virus has decreased over the recent weeks. In Cuba, influenza B also predominated among influenza detections, and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) associated hospitalizations remained high due mainly to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In Nicaragua, influenza A(H3) was the predominant influenza virus subtype following an earlier wave of influenza B in August 2014.

Tropical countries in South America reported influenza-like illness (ILI) and SARI activity within the expected range for this time of the year. RSV continued to circulate but with decreasing trends. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 was the most frequently detected respiratory virus, and activity remained low. In Colombia, influenza activity continued, with influenza A(H3N2) predominating. Peru also experienced ongoing influenza with co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B; however, influenza activity decreased and was lower than last year [2013].

In Brazil, activity continued with co-circulation of influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses. Influenza activity was predominantly reported from the southeastern region, where influenza A(H3N2) was the most commonly detected virus.

Influenza update - 20 Oct 2014 4

Central African tropical region

In Africa, influenza activity reported from most countries in eastern, middle and western Africa was at low levels.

Tropical Asia
-------------
In most southern Asian and south eastern Asian countries, activity declined or remained low.

In India and Nepal, activity decreased after earlier peaks caused primarily by influenza A(H3N2) viruses and some influenza B virus detections.

In southern China, ILI consultations increased slightly, but the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza decreased. Influenza activity in south China was predominantly due to influenza A(H3N2) virus.

The Lao People's Democratic Republic and Thailand reported low influenza activity predominated by influenza B viruses, but Thailand reported high RSV activity with over 40 per cent of specimens testing positive for RSV.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Temperate zone of South America

In the temperate zone of South America, influenza activity continued to decrease.

In Chile and Argentina, ILI activity continued to decrease, corresponding with a decrease RSV. Influenza detections also decreased, with co-circulation of influenza A and B.

In Paraguay, the ILI consultation rate decreased but remained at high levels compared with previous years, and the proportion of samples testing positive for influenza decreased.

SARI notifications and influenza activity both decreased in Uruguay.

In South Africa, ILI and SARI activity remained low, with influenza B predominating among positive ILI samples and co-circulating with influenza A(H3N2) virus.

Oceania, Melanesia and Polynesia

In Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity decreased, with co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and some influenza B.

In Australia, ILI activity and the notification of laboratory confirmed cases decreased significantly across all jurisdictions.

In New Zealand, the ILI consultation rate remained below the seasonal threshold and dropped below the average epidemic curve.

In the Pacific Islands, ILI activity was variable; notifications were above 90 per cent of historical values in the Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, New Caledonia, Northern Mariana Islands, Solomon Islands, and Tokelau.

Influenza virus activity remains virtually absent in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas normal winter levels have not been exceeded in the Southern Hemisphere. In some Southern Hemisphere countries, respiratory syncytial virus has been responsible for more cases of illness than the influenza viruses.

The predominance of existing serotypes and absence of any novel types indicate that the composition of the existing northern hemisphere vaccine and projected southern hemisphere vaccine should be sufficient to moderate the next influenza outbreak.
