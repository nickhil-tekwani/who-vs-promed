Schistosomiasis grips villages in Leyte town
-------------------------------------------
A total of 99 persons from Palo, Leyte, have fallen ill due to
schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease that is spread by contact with
contaminated water.

Lilia Navarra, laboratory technician of the Schistosomiasis Research
and Training Center based in Palo, said authorities examined the stool
and blood samples of 148 persons, and found that 99 of them had
schistosomiasis.

The patients were from the 33 barangays [the smallest administrative
division in the Philippines] of Palo, about 12 km [7.5 mi] from the
capital city of Tacloban, which was one of the areas in Leyte that
were hit by floods on 16 and 17 Mar 2011. The floods that hit Palo
last March were confirmed as the cause of the spread of the
infection.

The number of patients may rise since several people from different
barangays in Palo had visited the center to have their blood and stool
samples examined for possible infection, said Navarra.

On Wednesday [8 Jun 2011], 23 persons went to the center for tests.
One of them was a 21-year-old woman, who asked not to be identified.
She said she had been suffering from fever and body malaise in the
past few days. She decided to go to the center after several of her
neighbors tested positive of schistosomiasis. "I just hope that it (my
test results) will be negative," she said.

According to Navarra, the patients may have waded in flood waters
which were populated with snails, the intermediate host of cercaria,
the parasitic larvae that cause the disease.

[Schistosomiasis is endemic in the Philippines and previous control
programmes have not been efficient. A recent review compares the
control programmes in China and the Philippines (Bergquist R and
Tanner M: Controlling schistosomiasis in Southeast Asia: a tale of two
countries. Adv Parasitol. 2010; 72:109-44; abstract available at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20624530).

One problem with the eradication of _Schistosoma japonicum_ in the
Philippines is an animal reservoir in water buffaloes (Wu HW et al:

buffaloes in the Philippines assessed by real-time polymerase chain
reaction. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2010; 82(4): 646-52; available at

Palo is a municipality in the province of Leyte in the Eastern
Visayas region. Maps of the Philippines are available at
