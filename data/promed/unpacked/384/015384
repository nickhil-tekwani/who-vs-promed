Yellow fever in Sudan - update
------------------------------
The Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) in Sudan began a 10-day mass vaccination campaign against yellow fever in Darfur on 20 Nov 2012, in response to the outbreak.

As of 17 Nov 2012, the outbreak is reported to have affected 26 localities, with a total of 459 suspected cases including 116 deaths. 2 cases were confirmed by IgM ELISA test and RT-PCR by the WHO regional reference laboratory for yellow fever, the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal. An outbreak investigation team led by the Ministry of Health, with support from WHO, are in the field to assess the extent of the outbreak and prioritize areas for the mass vaccination campaign.

With support from the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG), the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), and international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), the vaccination campaign will be carried out in the most affected 12 localities in Darfur region, targeting approximately 2.2 million people.

The YF-ICG is a partnership which manages stockpile of yellow fever vaccines for emergency response. It is represented by United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and WHO, which also serves as the Secretariat.

The 7 INGOs, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, MSF-Belgium, MSF-Spain, MSF-Swiss, Merlin, Save the Children-Swiss, and International Medical Corps are currently working in the 12 localities prioritized for the vaccination campaign. They will actively support the FMOH in this emergency response.

WHO is supporting the State Ministries of Health in conducting field investigations to better assess the epidemiological situation and the risk of disease spread, as well as on-the-job trainings for health staff to strengthen their disease surveillance systems and to improve collection of samples and laboratory diagnosis.

WHO has activated the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and additional support will soon be provided to the ongoing response efforts in the country.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[This report provides useful details about the national and international participants in yellow fever (YF) outbreak control in Darfur. A team effort will be very helpful in evaluating the situation and planning vaccination campaigns. The report above indicates that there are 116 YF deaths. Previous reports have indicated that there have been 137-150 deaths. The report above also indicates that the vaccinations will take place over 10 days. Previous reports indicated that the time period would be 12 days. One still wonders if that will be sufficient time to immunize a proportion of the population sufficient to break the chain of transmission, given that cases are reported from very disparate localities in this large West, Central, and South Darfur area. Further information about the progress of the campaign and the results of intensified surveillance will be welcome.
