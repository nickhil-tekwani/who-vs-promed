In a 3-week span, 2 newborn baby girls born at Doctors Medical Center in Modesto, CA contracted salmonellosis.

The scariest part for expecting parents is that hospital administrators and county health officials have not been able to pinpoint how the infants treated at the hospital got the bacteria in their systems. "We don't have an answer yet. However, there has been intense investigation," said Dr. John Walker, Stanislaus County Public Health.

One of the infants' moms sparked the investigation. She suspects that salmonella-tainted formula given to her newborn while in the neonatal intensive care unit caused the illness.

In a statement, a hospital administrator said: "Doctors Medical Center takes this issue extremely seriously, and after thorough review, it appears that all hospital policies and protocols were followed. It appears that this was an isolated event."

Walker says salmonella poisoning in newborns is extremely rare. The biggest concern is whether the infection would turn into an outbreak, which hasn't happened.

"Fortunately, this doesn't appear to be a widespread issue; however, state department of health is looking closely, and hopefully all of us get answers soon," said Walker.

No other cases have been diagnosed within the period.

[This is a worrisome situation, especially if the isolates from the 2 cases are identical. If contaminated formula was the vehicle, one might expect to have more cases. ProMED awaits more information as it becomes available. - Mod.LL
