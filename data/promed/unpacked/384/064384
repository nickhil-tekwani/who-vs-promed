The Central Highlands province of Kon Tum on Monday evening [29 Jun 2020] reported 3 cases of diphtheria, bringing the total number in the province since the beginning of this year [2020] to 8.

According to the province's Health Department, the 3 latest diphtheria patients include 2 people aged 11 and 25 in Dak To District and another aged 10 in Sa Thay District. They are being treated at the districts' health care centres and are in a stable condition.

The province's Centre for Diseases Control on Monday [29 Jun 2020] took 36 testing samples in Dak To District and 52 in Sa Thay District.

Vice chairwoman of the province People's Committee Tran Thị Nga said local isolated people who had close contact with the patients or those suspected to have the disease. She said local authorities also increased communication and called on people to get fully vaccinated to prevent diseases for themselves and the community.

So far, 5 out of 8 diphtheria cases in the province have tested negative for diphtheria.

By Tuesday [30 Jun 2020], the Central Highlands province of Dak Nong had gone 7 days without any new cases of diphtheria after 4 were reported on Krong No District between [3 and 8 Jun 2020], and 8 cases were reported in Dak G'long District between [18 and 22 Jun 2020]. Of the 12 reported diphtheria cases in the province, a 9-year-old girl in Quang Hoa Commune, Dak G'long District died on June 20 [2020]. It was reported she was not vaccinated against diphtheria. Huynh Thanh Huynh, director of Dak G'long District Health Care Centre said that from the evening of [19 Jun 2020], local authorities isolated and tested people in the hamlet where the girl lived and 2 surrounding hamlets. More than 800 people that were identified as having contact with the confirmed cases were quarantined in the community, Huynh said.

All of Quang Hoa Commune was disinfected, Huynh said. Nguyen Ba Thuy, an official of Quang Hoa Commune, said quarantined people were given 5kg [11 lb] of rice each per week and other food was provided to those who needed. Local commune officers and health workers went to every house in the affected areas to examine and give people medicine, which reassured them much after the death of the girl.

Besides Dak Nong and Kon Tum, HCM [Ho Chi Minh] City also reported 1 case of diphtheria last week [week of 22 Jun 2020].

[Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable infection, caused by toxin-producing strains of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, an aerobic Gram-positive bacillus. Toxin production occurs only when the bacillus is infected by a specific bacteriophage that carries the gene encoding the toxin. The toxin is responsible for the major complications -- myocarditis (such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure) and neuritis (such as paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm). _C. ulcerans_ and _C. pseudotuberculosis_ can also harbor diphtheria toxin genes and cause zoonotic infection in humans.

Humans are the only reservoir of _C. diphtheriae_. Transmission of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur through respiratory droplets, direct contact with cutaneous infections, and articles soiled with discharges from the respiratory tract or skin lesions. Organisms can be shed for up to 4 weeks without antibiotics, but chronic carriers may shed organisms for 6 months or more. Effective antibiotic therapy promptly terminates shedding. The organisms can survive in dust and clothing for up to 6 months (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf). Shedding from cutaneous lesions can cause respiratory and cutaneous infections in contacts.

Diphtheria toxoid vaccine is available combined with tetanus toxoid, both in full-strength doses (denoted by upper case letters "DT") in pediatric formulations and in reduced-strength dose combined with full-strength dose of tetanus toxoid (denoted by upper case T and lower case d, "Td") in adult formulations. These are combined with acellular or whole-cell pertussis antigens in full strength in pediatric formulations (DTaP, DTwP) or in reduced strength in the adolescent/adult-formulations (Tdap). In the United States, a total of 5 DTaP doses are recommended to be given to children, one dose each at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, with booster doses at ages 15-18 months, and 4-6 years (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/child-schedule.htm).

The DTP3 (the 1st 3 doses) coverage in Viet Nam is estimated to be 75% in 2018, having fallen from above an estimated 90% coverage in each of the preceding 4 years (https://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/vnm.pdf).

Respiratory diphtheria is treated with diphtheria antitoxin and antibiotic. Td vaccination is recommended for the patient's close contacts (that is, those who may have been exposed to respiratory secretions or who are close household contacts) if Td has not been administered within the last 5 years. These contacts should have nasal and pharyngeal specimens obtained for culture and should also be given antibiotic prophylaxis.

Kon Tum, with a population of approximately 530 000 residents in 2019, located on the border with both Laos and Cambodia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kon_Tum_Province) and Dak Nong, with a population of 574 673 residents in 2018, located on the border with Cambodia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Đắk_Nông_Province), are provinces inland in the Central Highlands region of Viet Nam.
