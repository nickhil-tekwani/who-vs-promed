2000/046D - Potato yellow mosaic begomovirus
--------------------------------------------
Why: Potato yellow mosaic begomovirus came to our attention as causing an
emerging disease of potato and tomato in the Americas.
Where: Potato yellow mosaic was first described in Venezuela in 1986 on
potatoes (Roberts et al., 1986). A very similar virus was found on tomato
crops in Venezuela (Guzman et al., 1997). These findings were considered as
strains or tomato-infecting isolates of potato yellow mosaic virus. Potato
yellow mosaic begomovirus was found on tomato crops in the Caribbean: in
Guadeloupe (1992), Martinique (1993), Puerto Rico (1994) (Polston et al.,
1998), Trinidad and Tobago (Polston & Anderson, 1997).
Distribution: Guadeloupe, Martinique, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago,
Venezuela
On which plants: Potato (_Solanum tuberosum_), tomato (_Lycopersicon
esculentum_).
Damage: On potato, it causes a bright yellow mosaic, leaf distortion and
stunting. On tomato, it causes chlorotic mottling, leaf distortion, leaf
rolling and stunting. Epidemic levels were reported on tomato crops from
Guadeloupe and Martinique, as many tomato fields had more than 70 % plants
showing symptoms. High incidence was also reported on tomato in Trinidad
and Tobago. No indication is given on the significance of the disease on
potato crops.
Transmission: Transmitted by _Bemisia tabaci_, and in particular epidemic
levels in the Caribbean were associated with _B. tabaci_ biotype B.
Note: It is not known whether tomato-infecting isolates can infect potato.
Pathway: Infected potato and tomato plants, potato tubers?, tomato fruits?,
viruliferous _B. tabaci_ from countries where potato yellow mosaic
begomovirus occurs.
Possible risks: Potato and tomato are important crops in the EPPO region.
The significance of the disease is unknown on potato, but appears to be
rather high on tomato crops. The vector is present in many parts of the
EPPO region.

[Experiments are required to determine if tomato-infecting isolates of
virus can infect potato. If so, then surveys are needed to determine if
potato is a natural host of such isolates. Moreover, infection of potato by
potato isolates may predispose infected plants to infection by tomato
isolates. -Mod. DH]
