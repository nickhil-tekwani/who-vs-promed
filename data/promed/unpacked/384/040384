USGS Teleconference: Impact of West Nile Virus on Wildlife
----------------------------------------------------------
Robert McLean, director of the US Geological Survey (USGS)'s National
Wildlife Health Center, said that West Nile virus (WNV) is turning out to be
a major menace to US wildlife, and the Center has serious concerns about its
spread. It is now the middle of the southward migration season, with birds
from New York State filling the flyways down the eastern seaboard. On 21 Sep
2000, Maryland officials reported their first 2 WNV positive birds this
year, whereas last year the first infected bird in Maryland was not detected
until late October. USGS has a watch out as far south as Louisiana for
possible infected birds.
USGS has a useful web page on the subject:
<http://www.umesc.usgs.gov/http_data/nwhc/news/westnil2.html> from which the
following is quoted: "West Nile virus has [now been isolated from over 63
species of birds, including 53 free-ranging species from 7 states.
Free-living mammal species in New York were found positive for WNV for the
first time this year. The virus has been detected in 16 horses from 5
states. Fifteen people are reported as clinically ill from WNV this year,
with one human death." This information is as of 20 Sep 2000. According to
the New York State map dated 28 Sep 2000, there have now been 14 bats, 3
squirrels, 2 raccoons, one chipmunk (and 3 domestic rabbits) confirmed WNV
positive -- see:
