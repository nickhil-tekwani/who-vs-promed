News of the response
Mastering the Ebola outbreak in Beni [North Kivu]
-------------------------------------------------
This Tue 19 Feb 2019 marks the 21st day with no new confirmed cases of Ebola in the Beni health zone. This is a major breakthrough after the outbreak that peaked between September and November 2018. We can consider that the Ebola outbreak is currently under control in Beni. Other health zones that have not reported a new confirmed case of Ebola in the last 21 days are Kayina and Musienene [in North Kivu] and Mandima, Nyankunde, and Tchomia [in Ituri].

However, there is still a risk of resumption of the epidemic in Beni because of frequent population displacements between Beni and neighboring areas where the epidemic remains active, including Butembo and Katwa [North Kivu].

The health zones of Katwa and Butembo remain the main focus of the epidemic at present. In the last 21 days, 92 new confirmed Ebola cases were reported, of which 58 (or 63%) were in Katwa and 16 (or 17%) were in Butembo.

As a reminder, the epidemic will be officially over when the country has not registered any new cases of Ebola for 42 days, that is, twice 21 days (the incubation period of the virus).

News of the response
Vaccination
-----------
Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 81 306 persons have been vaccinated.

[2] Outbreak summary
Date: Mon 18 Feb 2019 CIDRAP News

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/02/new-cases-katwa-remains-epicenter-ebola-outbreak


With new cases, Katwa [North Kivu] remains epicenter of Ebola outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------------------
More cases recorded today [18 Feb 2019] and over the weekend [16-17 Feb 2019] underscore that Katwa, a city in the eastern reaches of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), remains the current epicenter of the 7-month-long Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. On Saturday and Sunday, the DRC's health ministry said there were 2 new Ebola cases in Katwa, and 1 new case in Vuhovi. Today, the ministry reported 2 new cases, one each in Katwa and Butembo.

The new cases raise the outbreak total to 840 cases, of which 775 are confirmed and 65 are probable. There have been 537 deaths during the outbreak, and 185 suspected cases are still under investigation. 7 deaths were recorded over the last 3 days, including 3 community deaths in Katwa, Butembo, and Vuhovi. Community deaths, which occur outside of a hospital or Ebola treatment center, raise the risk of Ebola transmission.

Vaccinations pass the 80 000 mark
---------------------------------
Since August [2018], a total of 80 989 people in the DRC and neighboring countries have been vaccinated with Merck's candidate VSV-EBOV vaccine, including 20 593 in Katwa.

On [Fri 15 Feb 2019], Martin Fayulu, the leader of the Lamuka party, visited Butembo and called for the observance of hygiene measures at a rally. Fayulu considers himself president-elect of the DRC. Fayulu also visited a treatment center in Katwa and praised local health workers for their job.

The visit took place against the backdrop against growing violence in the region, which prompted Doctors Without Borders (MSF) to withdraw nonessential aid workers from Masisi, in North Kivu province. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), MSF suspended work in the region after gunmen abducted 2 staff members on 8 Feb 2019. Though the region is not currently the site of any Ebola activity, the area is only 100 km [62 mi] from Goma, the capital of North Kivu.

[3] Vaccine and response
- Wed 20 Feb 2019. Women and children
[STAT News, abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/20/ebola-pregnancy-reversal/
[Byline: Helen Branswell]

Ebola vaccine will be provided to women who are pregnant, marking reversal in policy
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Women who are pregnant and lactating, as well as children under the age of 1, will be offered access to an experimental Ebola vaccine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, officials said [Wed 20 Feb 2019], marking the reversal of a controversial policy that had drawn fire from public health experts.

The decision was made by a committee advising the Congolese Ministry of Health but received the support of the World Health Organization.

The decision to exclude pregnant women from the vaccination program sparked blowback from some experts, with some calling the policy "indefensible."

Proponents of the earlier policy argued that the vaccine, which goes by the provisional name V920 [also known as rVSV-ZEBOV], might harm the fetus or trigger a miscarriage. But the risk of fetal and maternal death is very high for pregnant women who contract Ebola.

The decision to exclude lactating women was due to concerns the vaccine viruses might be transmitted via breast milk. In the case of children under the age of 1, the vaccine has not yet been tested.

Outside of those populations, health officials in the DRC have been offering the vaccine to people who have been in contact with someone with Ebola -- or are a contact of one of those contacts. The same policy will now extend to the women and children previously excluded. Carleigh Krubiner, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, welcomed the news.

"The DRC's decision to extend Ebola vaccine coverage to pregnant women is a huge step forward, not only for pregnant women in areas affected by outbreaks but for all pregnant women who may face the threat of Ebola in the future," Krubiner said in a statement.

To date, there have been 844 confirmed and probable cases in this outbreak, which is now in its 7th month. Of those, 528 people have died. Krubiner said the policy reversal will not only offer pregnant women the protection of the vaccine, but also provide a critical chance to see how the vaccine, which is being developed by Merck, works in these women. That knowledge will be of benefit in future outbreaks, she said.

Reluctance to offer the vaccine to pregnant and lactating women has stemmed from the fact it is a live-virus vaccine. The virus it contains is not Ebola; it is a livestock virus called vesicular stomatitis virus [VSV] that can infect but does not sicken people. A key protein from the Ebola virus has been fused to the VSV virus, which then induces the immune system to develop a protective response when it encounters Ebola.

Traditionally there has been concern about using live-virus vaccines in pregnant women. Krubiner and others have argued that women ought to be informed of the risks and offered the choice.

It was not immediately clear whether even newborns could be vaccinated.

Women and young children have made up a disproportionate share of the cases in the outbreak in the DRC, which is happening mainly in North Kivu province. An update issued earlier this week from WHO's Africa division said 57 percent of the cases so far have been women and 30 percent have been children under the age of 18. About half of the cases in children have been in kids under the age of 5, the UN. International Children's Emergency Fund reported in its most recent update.

The DRC's decision was affirmed by a WHO strategic advisory group of experts on immunization. The group is known as the SAGE.

The WHO did not immediately respond to a request for an interview. A spokeswoman for the Congolese Ministry of Health, Jessica Ilunga, said it would not make any statement on the policy change until a final pending authorization had been approved later this week.

[This is a move in the right direction since according to SAGE, as of 13 Feb 2019, 57% of the confirmed and probable cases are females of which 61% (35% of total cases) are of childbearing age (15 to 49 years). - Mod.LK

Also see https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/pregnant-women-given-ebola-vaccine-policy-u-turn/ from 21 Feb 2019, by Anne Gulland, Global health security correspondent. It includes additional information that "between 80 and 90 per cent of all pregnant women who contracted the disease died. Very few babies of Ebola-affected mothers have survived." In a statement, SAGE said: "As recommended by the ethics committee, every effort must be made to collect data on the safety of the vaccine in these populations, including a documentation of the pregnancy outcomes. Sage advises that the use of rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine in pregnant women currently remains limited to the Ebola virus disease outbreak affected areas in DRC and should be continuously evaluated based on the emerging data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in this target population. This careful review of the emerging safety data is needed to inform vaccine recommendations for future outbreaks." - Rapp.KI]

- Tue 19 Feb 2019. Zambia screening at border
[Media Congo; in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]
https://www.mediacongo.net/article-actualite-47816_la_zambie_intensifie_le_depistage_du_virus_ebola_a_la_frontiere_avec_la_rdc.html


Zambian health authorities have intensified Ebola screening among travelers in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a senior official said [Mon 18 Feb 2019].

Health officials have stepped up Ebola testing at the Kasumbalesa border crossing in Chililabombwe district, Copperbelt province, the busiest border entry between the 2 countries.

Paul Mulenga, Chililabombwe District Commissioner, said the health staff had set up a border crossing screening office due to the Ebola outbreak in parts of the DRC.

He added that the 2 countries maintain cordial bilateral relations, which allowed people to cross the borders to conduct their business. He added that it was imperative to screen for Ebola because of the large number of people using the border entry.
