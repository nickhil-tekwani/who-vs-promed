------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 13 Oct 2014 from Dr Jean Luc Angot, Directeur General Adjoint, Direction Generale de l'Alimentation, Ministere de l'Agriculture et de la Peche, Paris, France

Summary:
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 2 Oct 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 2 Oct 2014
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 5 Oct 012
Manifestation of disease: Sub-clinical disease
Causal agent: Equine infectious anaemia virus
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks, Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Montfaucon, Gard
Date of start of the outbreak: 2 Oct 2014
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Equidae / 16 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: The 16 horses are owned by an individual. A stallion was found infected with equine infectious anaemia following a Coggin's test carried out before breeding. No animal shows clinical signs. Tests are underway on the other equines.

Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 6.25 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent / 6.25 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: An epidemiological investigation is being carried out to establish the source of the infection and to identify the horses that have been in contact with the infected animal.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; screening; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: control of arthropods, disinfection of premises/establishment(s); modified stamping out

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
ANSES (National Food Security Agency) (National laboratory) / Equidae / Coggin's test / 2 Oct 2014 / Positive

[Equine infectious anaemia (EIA) is a persistent viral infection of equids. The causative agent, EIA virus (EIAV), is a lentivirus in the family Retroviridae, subfamily Orthoretrovirinae. Other members of the genus _Lentivirus_ include: bovine immunodeficiency virus; caprine arthritis encephalitis virus; feline immunodeficiency virus; human immunodeficiency virus 1; human immunodeficiency virus 2; and maedi/visna virus. EIA can be diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs, pathological lesions, serology and molecular methods. Infected horses remain viraemic carriers for life and, with very rare exceptions, yield a positive serological test result. Antibody response usually persists, and antibody-positive animals older than 6-8 months are identified as virus carriers (below 6-8 months of age, serological reactions can be due to maternal antibodies; status can be confirmed by molecular techniques). Infected equids are potential virus reservoirs. Biting flies are mechanical vectors for the virus in nature.

EIAV is not considered a risk for human health.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2014, Chapter 2.5.6 "Equine infectious anaemia" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.06_EIA.pdf (adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates in May 2013).

In the previous EIA event, France reported 2 outbreaks. One outbreak occurred in the Department of Vaucluse (Provence-Alpes Cote d'zur region) and the 2nd was located in the Department of Gard (Languedoc- Roussillon region).
