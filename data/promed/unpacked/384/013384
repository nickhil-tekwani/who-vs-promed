The number of people infected in the latest [legionellosis] outbreak in Portugal climbed to 13 on [Wed 21 Jan 2018], the country's Directorate-General of Health (DGS) announced. The outbreak was first reported on [Sun 28 Jan 2018], with 4 cases detected at the CUF Descobertas Hospital in Lisbon.

The number of infected has since risen to 13, of whom 9 are female and 3 are in intensive care.

The hospital's shower system is thought to be the most likely cause, with sink taps being investigated too.

_Legionella_ [are] bacteria that live in water. They are best known as the bacteria that cause legionnaire's disease, a serious form of pneumonia.

In 2017, 233 cases of [legionellosis] were detected in Portugal.

In 2014, a [legionellosis] outbreak in Vila Franca de Xira, a region in the east of Lisbon district, infected 375 and killed 12.

Just months after the legionnaires' disease outbreak at São Francisco Xavier Hospital in Lisbon ended, another Lisbon area hospital is reporting an outbreak of the bacterial infection.

Health authorities of Portugal confirmed today [30 Jan 2018] that there are 7 cases of [legionellosis] reported at the CUF Descobertas Hospital in east Lisbon, according to a La Vanguardia report (computer translated). The 6 female and 1 male patients are reported in stable condition and being treated for the infection.

A team of nurses of the medical center is responsible for this task, which consists of contacting about 800 patients who are estimated to have been treated between [6-26 Jan 2018], when the outbreak was triggered, to check if they present the symptoms of legionellosis, according to the report.

Of the 4 cases of legionellosis detected at the CUF Descobertas Hospital in Lisbon, 2 were diagnosed in hospital employees, said the deputy clinical director of the private unit, Paulo Gomes, on [Sun 28 Jan 2018].

The 1st case of legionellosis in the hospital was detected early yesterday morning [27 Jan 2018] in a patient who came to the hospital with a picture "compatible with pneumonia," which later turned out to be caused by _Legionella_ bacteria. As the patient had been hospitalized a few weeks ago, "all the safety procedures and protocols were triggered," the official said. Asked if the hospital admits there may be more cases of the disease in the coming days, the deputy clinical director said only that "everything is open" and said, "we are acting as if the source of the outbreak is in the hospital."

Two of the patients diagnosed with legionellosis are medical assistants at the hospital unit. "Harvests were made, either on our behalf or on the health authority's behalf, of samples throughout the hospital." The results should be known soon.

He added that, contrary to what happened at the Hospital San Francisco Xavier, the origin of an outbreak of legionellosis that caused 6 fatalities, the problem in CUF Descobertas "is not with the air conditioning. We do not have cooling towers, we do not have this fragility. The causal link, if any, is in sanitary water systems." The system has since been sterilized, using a "chemical shock" -- an increase in chlorine concentration -- and a "thermal shock" -- a rise in water temperature, said Paulo Gomes.

The deputy clinical director also asked anyone who has been in the hospital over the last 2 weeks to go to the hospital if he or she exhibits symptoms compatible with legionellosis, including breathing difficulties, flu symptoms, or diarrhea.

The Directorate-General for Health informed in a statement [Sun 28 Jan 2018] that 4 cases of legionellosis had been diagnosed at the Hospital CUF Descobertas. "All the patients are women and all of them are stable," said the DGS report released on [Sun 28 Jan 2018].

"The Health Authorities, in conjunction with the Board of Directors of the Hospital CUF Descobertas and in collaboration with the National Institute of Health Dr Ricardo Jorge initiated the necessary intervention at the Hospital," the statement said, explaining that the objectives in this phase are the diagnosis and treatment of patients, reinforcement of epidemiological surveillance, reinforcement of environmental surveillance, and implementation of measures to stop the transmission of the disease.

"The entities involved continue to monitor the evolution of the situation and the Directorate-General for Health will update the information whenever necessary," concludes the note.

All patients are women and all are stable.

Also in a statement, the CUF Descobertas Hospital, a private hospital unit, reported that it immediately reported the cases to DGS, adding that it has "very strict epidemiological and safety control procedures that have now been reinforced in a preventive manner."

"The monitoring of the situation is being done in close coordination with the health authorities, with priority being given to the treatment of patients, who are stable and have a positive prognosis."

It is recalled that an outbreak of legionellosis that originated in the São Francisco Xavier Hospital in Lisbon infected more than 50 people in November [2017] and killed 6 people.

The _Legionella_ bacteria are responsible for legionnaires' disease, a form of severe pneumonia that usually begins with dry cough, fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and respiratory distress, and abdominal pain and diarrhea. The incubation of the disease takes place 5 to 6 days after the infection, and can go up to 10 days.

The infection can be contracted by air (respiratory), through the inhalation of water droplets or by aspiration of contaminated water. Although severe, the infection has effective treatment.

[The source of this nosocomial outbreak of legionellosis is thought to be the hospital's potable water system, unlike last year's (2017) nosocomial outbreak at another Lisbon hospital, where the hospital's cooling system was thought to be the problem. Molecular typing clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can help delineate transmission pathways. More information on the outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.
