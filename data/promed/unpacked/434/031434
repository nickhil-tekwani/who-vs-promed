Two patients recently died of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in the
Southern Kazakh Oblast, [according to] the Ministry for Emergencies press
service, Kazakhstan Today reported on Sat 17 Apr 2010.

A 21 year old woman died on Thu 15 Apr 2010 in the perinatal treatment
centre in [the city of] Turkestan. A 36 year old man died on Thu 15 Apr
2010 in a hospital in the Kazgurt District.

The fever is transmitted by ticks and is found in the former Soviet Union,
including Central Asia, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the most widely distributed of
the viral haemorrhagic fevers. Although primarily a zoonosis, sporadic
cases and outbreaks of CCHF affecting humans occur frequently. The disease
is endemic in Kazakhstan (for example, see the ProMED-mail archived reports
below) and many countries in Africa, Europe, and Asia. The disease was
first described in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean
haemorrhagic fever. In 1969 it was recognized that the pathogen causing
Crimean haemorrhagic fever was the same as that responsible for an illness
identified in 1956 in the Congo, and linkage of the 2 place names resulted
in the current name for the disease and the virus. CCHF is a severe disease
in humans, with a high mortality rate (about 30 per cent). Fortunately,
human illness occurs infrequently, although infection of livestock is common.

The geographical distribution of CCHF virus is determined by the
distribution of its tick vector -- predominantly ticks belonging to the
genus _Hyalomma_. Healthcare and hospital staff in endemic areas should be
aware of the illness and the correct infection control procedures to
protect themselves and their patients from the risk of nosocomial
(person-to-person) infection. There is no protective vaccine, but the
antiviral drug ribavirin has been used in treatment of established CCHF
infection with apparent benefit.
