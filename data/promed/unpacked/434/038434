Blackleg fungus found in Oklahoma winter canola
-----------------------------------------------
Phoma blackleg or phoma stem canker are the names of a plant disease
recently observed in winter canola fields near Cherokee and as far south as
Hennssey. Located first by Heath Sanders, Oklahoma State University [OSU],
it has not previously been confirmed in Oklahoma.

OSU are working to determine the extent of the disease in the 2009-10
Oklahoma winter canola crop. Because the disease has been seen in several
areas in the state, it is likely that it has been present at low levels for
several years. The outbreak this year [2009] is most likely due to the
cool, wet weather that helps the disease to develop and spread.

There are 2 species of blackleg fungus. One, _Leptosphaeria maculans_, is
more aggressive than the other one, _L. biglobosa_. _L. maculans_, the more
aggressive, is the one discovered in Oklahoma according to laboratory tests
made by OSU specialists. It can attack plants at all ages and significantly
affect yield.

In this early stage of the 2009-10 winter crop, growers should take no
action besides scouting their fields for symptoms of blackleg. Symptoms
should not be confused with normal winter dormancy and dieback of canola
leaves in cold weather.

Care should be taken to avoid introducing the fungus to uninfested fields.
It may take large canola roots 2 to 5 years to break down, and until
stubble is completely decomposed, spores can be produced that infect new
plants. Fungicides may have some value if applied to young plants and are
most valuable as seed treatments.

[Blackleg (also called phoma stem canker or leaf spot) caused by the fungus
_Leptosphaeria maculans_ is the most serious disease of oilseed rape
(canola is a group of cultivars with modified oil components) with a
possible yield loss of up to 50 per cent or more. It can also affect other
species in the _Brassicaceae_ family, such as cabbage, turnip, and some
weeds, which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms on rapeseed may
include lesions on leaves, stems, and pods, with stem cankers leading to
premature ripening or collapse of the crop. However, symptomless infections
may also occur.

The related species _L. biglobosa_ was described in 2001 from France but
has since also been recorded in other areas, including the Americas and
parts of Australia. It has been reported to colonise stems less effectively
than _L. maculans_ and consequently cause less crown cankering and less
crop damage.

The fungi are seedborne and also spread by wind, splash dispersal,
mechanical means (for example on contaminated equipment), and infected crop
litter. They may overwinter in stubble, which is therefore often sprayed
with fungicides. As mentioned above, however, this would not eliminate the
risk from remaining underground parts of infected plants. Disease
management includes use of clean seed, cultural practices to minimise
inoculum, fungicides, and planting of resistant cultivars. The _L.
maculans_ pathogen is extremely diverse with new strains evolving
frequently some of which have overcome major resistance genes within
certain varieties in the past.
