- Thu 19 Sep 2019. Ebola uptick amid DRC security incidents
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) News Scan, abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/09/news-scan-sep-19-2019

Ebola transmission intensity increased slightly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) outbreak region last week [11-17 Sep 2019], with 57 new confirmed cases amid minor security flare-ups and major violence in Mandima health zone that suspended response operations, the World Health Organization (WHO) said today [19 Sep 2019] in its weekly snapshot of the outbreak.

The major incident, 1st reported yesterday [18 Sep 2019], was community violence in Lwemba in Mandima health zone that was sparked by the death of a local health worker from Ebola. The WHO said the event has serious impact on response activities and could lead to gaps or delays in reporting in the area, which is one of the Ebola hot spots. The minor incidents affected safe and dignified burials and vaccination in Mambasa and Komanda health zones.

The WHO said most cases over the past 3 weeks are from 3 hot spots: Kalunguta, Mambasa, and Mandima. It added that cases in Beni have declined.

In other developments, 5 new cases were reported in the DRC, raising the outbreak total to 3150, according to numbers reflected on the WHO's online Ebola dashboard. Health officials are still investigating 430 suspected cases, and the death toll is at 2103, reflecting 5 more fatalities.

The DRC's multisector Ebola response committee (CMRE) provided a few more details on the 15 cases reported yesterday [18 Sep 2019]. The patients are from Mambasa (5), Beni (4), Kalunguta (4), Komanda (1), and Mandima (1). Of 5 new deaths noted in the CMRE report, 2 occurred in community settings, which raises the risk of further spread.

[World Health Organization, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/19-september-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The intensity of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo increased slightly from last week, with 57 new confirmed cases reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces from [11-17 Sep 2019] versus 40 in the previous week. In the past week, localised, minor security incidents have impacted the response, including safe and dignified burials (SDB) and vaccination activities in Mambasa and Komanda health zones.

In addition, there was a major security incident in Lwemba, within Mandima Health Zone, from [14-17 Sep 2019]. The event was a community response to the death of a local healthcare worker from EVD. Due to the violence that occurred during the incident, all activities have been suspended in the area until further notice. This has a serious impact on the response activities on the ground, and it could lead to gaps or delays in the reporting of new EVD cases in this hotspot area. Overall, these incidents underscore the need for continued and proactive engagement and sensitizing of local communities throughout areas with EVD transmission and high-risk areas that may not currently be affected.

During the past 21 days (from 28 Aug through 17 Sep 2019), a total of 145 confirmed cases were reported from 14 health zones [see Table 1 and Figure 2 at the source URL], with the majority coming from the health zones of Kalunguta (21%, n = 30), Mambasa (21%, n = 30), and Mandima (19%, n = 27). With 14 cases in the last 21 days, there is a relative decrease in cases coming from Beni Health Zone. Masereka and Lolwa health zones cleared 21 days without a new confirmed case of EVD.

As of [17 Sep 2019], a total of 3145 EVD cases were reported, including 3034 confirmed and 111 probable cases, of which 2103 cases died (overall case fatality ratio, 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1760) were female, 29% (898) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (159) were health workers.

Under Pillar 1 of the current Strategic Response Plan, the estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is USD 287 million, including USD 120-140 million for WHO. As of 19 Sep 2019, close to USD 60 million have been received by WHO, with further funds committed or pledged. Currently available funds will close the financing gap just up until the end of October 2019. Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019. WHO is appealing to donors to provide generous support. A summary of funding received by WHO since the start of this outbreak can be found by [going to the source URL above].

[3] Response
- Thu 19 Sep 2019. Violence: Mandima health zone
[Daily Mail, abridged, edited]
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-7483567/Violence-hinders-DR-Congo-Ebola-response-amid-hike-cases-WHO.html

The World Health Organization warned Thursday [19 Sep 2019] that violence in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo had halted efforts to rein in Ebola in one area, even as the spread of the deadly virus intensified.

The UN health agency ... warned that transmission appeared to be worsening, after DRC's hard-hit North Kivu and Ituri provinces registered 57 new confirmed Ebola cases in the week leading up to [17 Sep 2019], compared with 40 new cases a week earlier.

At the same time, WHO said, a number of "localised, minor security incidents" continue to mar the response to the outbreak, including impeding safe burials of the highly contagious bodies and the administering of vaccines around Mambasa and Komanda.

Even more concerning was a 4-day "major security incident" that erupted in Lwemba, in the Mandima health zone in the northeastern Ituri province, last Friday [13 Sep 2019] in reaction to the Ebola death of a local healthcare worker.

"Due to the violence that occurred during the incident, all activities have been suspended in the area until further notice," WHO said. The UN health agency, which has declared the epidemic a "public health emergency of international concern", said the suspension was having "a serious impact on the response activities on the ground".

"It could lead to gaps or delays in the reporting of new (Ebola) cases in this hotspot area," it cautioned. Such incidents, it said, highlighted the vital need for continued and proactive engagement with communities in impacted areas.

- Thu 19 Sep 2019. Uganda and Tanzania
[All Africa, abridged, edited]
https://allafrica.com/stories/201909190708.html
[Byline: Franklin Draku]

Uganda has started tracing contacts associated with a Tanzanian doctor who died of suspected Ebola disease. President Museveni made the revelation during a joint press briefing with the visiting US secretary for Health and Human Services at State House in Entebbe.

Mr. Museveni said health officials have started tracing all those who came into [contact] with the suspected case before she went back to Tanzania for examination and possible isolation.

The 34-year-old Tanzanian, whose identity has not yet been revealed, had been studying a postgraduate degree at Makerere University. She succumbed to Ebola-like sickness last week [8 Sep 2019], raising fears that she had contracted the disease while in Uganda.

However, the Tanzanian government dismissed the claim, saying she died of a different disease, although they could not confirm the disease. "The case that went to Tanzania, I am sure we shall defeat it. Here locally, we have already started following up that person, the contacts she had here, and where she was staying in the hostel to examine them," Mr. Museveni said.

The President said Uganda is well prepared to contain any Ebola threat because of its past experience in containing the epidemic and also high level of motivation by the health workers. He thanked the US government for providing both technical and financial support to combat the DR Congo Ebola outbreak and for working closely with Uganda and other frontier countries, bordering the DR Congo.

Tighter border security: Dr. Jane Ruth Aceng, Uganda's Minister of Health, said a combined multi-sectoral team has been deployed at the all the entry points and some porous border points to monitor and screen all those coming to Uganda. She said the team comprises medical officials, village health team members, soldiers from Uganda People's Defence Forces, police and immigration officers, among others.

Dr. Aceng said with the team in place, Uganda is well placed to manage all emergencies that may arise. At least 4 people have died of Ebola in Uganda, although all the cases originated from the DR Congo.

"We have a multi-sectoral team that works day and night on the designated entry point and also what you would call porous border entry points. These teams use both walk-in scanners and portable devices to screen all people entering the country from DR Congo, so we have a very effective monitoring team on the ground," Dr. Aceng said.

[The headline is a little misleading in using the term suspected Ebola case -- yes, it had been suspected but lab tests demonstrated it was not Ebola. And the hunt for contacts is confusing because the Tanzanian government claimed the doctor did not die from Ebola. If that is correct, why search for contacts? It definitely would be informative to know what the etiologic agent was in this situation, whether it merits tracking down contacts.

Excerpted from https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tanzania-health/tanzania-tells-who-it-has-no-ebola-cases-statement-idUSKBN1W32DB?rpc=401&: "'The government of Tanzania has not made available the samples or the ability to test the index case of the individual who died, nor has it made available any other information,' Azar told reporters during a prearranged tour of Uganda, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to evaluate their Ebola response, according to a transcript of his remarks. He called on Tanzania to comply with international obligations to share information and allow independent verification of test results." - Mod.LK
