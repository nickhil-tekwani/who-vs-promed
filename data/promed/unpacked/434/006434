Investigators say that the makers of a Chinese antibiotic blamed for
6 deaths and dozens of illnesses failed to properly sterilize the
drug, which allowed dangerous amounts of bacteria to grow in it,
state media said Tuesday.
The government ordered a recall of batches of the drug last month
after a 6-year-old girl died. At least 5 more deaths were later
blamed on the clindamycin phosphate glucose manufactured by Anhui
Huayuan Worldbest Biology Pharmacy Co.
China's national drug regulator said the deaths were caused by
"improper manufacturing" and has promised to punish people
responsible for the mistakes, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
"The drug should go through a 30-minute disinfection process at 221
degrees," Xinhua quoted Wang Zhexiong, an official with the state
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as saying.
"But the company lowered the temperature to between 212 degrees to
219 degrees and shortened the time to only 1 to 4 minutes," Wang said.
Telephones at the company rang unanswered late Tuesday.
A team sent to investigate the manufacturer in Anhui province found
"excessive bacteria" in the sample they took, Xinhua said. Wang said
further analysis was needed to find out what kind of bacteria the
sample contained.
The FDA has promised to punish the manufacturer for its production
faults and hold related producers and managers accountable, but the
agency did not give details, Xinhua said.
The company had produced 3.7 million bottles of the injection since
June 2006, with most of that sold in 26 provinces across China, it said.
So far, more than 1.2 million bottles have been recalled and more
than 403 000 bottles have been located and sealed up, Zhang Jixiang,
another FDA official was cited as saying. He could not account for
the remaining stock.
China's pharmaceutical industry is highly lucrative but poorly
regulated, resulting in companies trying to cash in by substituting
fake or substandard ingredients.
Earlier this year, 11 people were killed after injecting a drug made
by the Qiqihar No. 2 Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. in the northeastern
province of Heilongjiang. An investigation showed that the drug,
called Armillarisni A, contained a chemical, diglycol, that can cause
kidney failure, which a vendor had passed off as a normal ingredient.
State media reports have said dozens of patients who took the Anhui
antibiotic developed severe adverse reactions, such as chest, kidney
or stomach pains, vomiting and anaphylactic shock.
The 6-year-old girl who was the first fatality from the drug died in
July in the northeastern city of Harbin. They said she received the
drug while being treated for a cold and developed a high fever.
Later deaths included a 74-year-old retired teacher who died Aug. 2.

[This current incident refers to an injectable antibiotic and was
likely used intravenously. Such a drug would have strict
sterilization standards, and lowering the temperature and
dramatically decreasing the time would, as reported here, allow
bacteria to grow, which could have disastrous consequences. It makes
one wonder where the quality control for product production and
post-production sterility testing has been.
Referring to the earlier incident, diglycol is often coupled with
butyl or ethyl and can cause a variety of symptoms depending upon the
method of exposure. Since antibiotics are generally used in
conditions where the individual may be in a weakened state, to put a
toxin in the mixture is likely lethal, as has happened in this case. - Mod.TG]
[The bad news here is that these types of events are occurring with
some frequency most likely related to the above stated deficiencies
in regulatory measures, the good news is that when the resultant
adverse events occur, there are investigations into their etiologies
with post event measures undertaken. - Mod.MPP]
