A woman and her son died of suspected rabies in Dimapur district of Nagaland in June [2021], officials said on 3 Jul [2021].

Officials of the Nagaland department of animal husbandry and veterinary services said that the deaths of the mother-son duo from Rilan village under Dimapur district in June this year [2021] was due to rabies infection. According to a statement issued by the veterinary surgeon of Dimapur District Veterinary Hospital, the 2 deceased were diagnosed with rabies on 9 Jun [2021]. The woman died on 10 Jun, while the son died on 11 Jun [2021].

Accordingly, the deaths were also reported to the chief medical officer of Dimapur. It said that after the deaths, a team [from the] veterinary hospital visited Rilan village on 24 Jun [2021] and collected a report from the village council chairman and secretary.

The victims were reportedly bitten by their own dog 20 days before their deaths, and the woman also had an earlier history of dog bite, the officials said.

Rabies is usually transmitted through an animal bite, for example, from unvaccinated stray dogs. Symptoms include fever, headache, excess salivation, muscle spasms, paralysis, and mental confusion.

[From the above information it is not clear if the victims died at home or elsewhere (rural clinic?). It is assumed that their kept dog, suspected to have infected them 20 days prior to their death, was already dead when they showed the 1st symptoms of the disease. These issues are expected to have been addressed during the epidemiological investigation by a veterinary team, performed about 2 weeks after the death. A more detailed report of the investigation will be helpful for lessons to be learned. - Mod.AS

Three persons succumbed to rabies virus, including an 8-year-old boy, in a village of Kavre district within a month.

The deceased are SP, 8; SL, 44; and TPP, 80, of Chaurideurali Rural Municipality-6, the Veterinary Hospital and Livestock Expert Centre in Kavre said.

According to the Centre, 22-year-old RKM of Dhulikhel Municipality-1 had also died of the same virus some 5 months ago. [He] had tested positive after a dog bit him while working to rescue a dog from drainage. It is said that the reason behind the death of all 4 was dog bites.

Likewise, a cow also died of rabies in Dhulikhel some months ago after a dog bit it. As Chaurideurali Rural Municipality reported the death of people due to rabies, it has urged the locals to apply precautions against stray dogs.

Likewise, the Centre said that it had sent 200 doses of anti-rabies vaccines [to] Chaurideurali after rabies was found in dogs there.

Chief of the Centre, Dr Mogal Prasad Shah, said that some 3000 stray dogs in Banepa, Dhulikhel, and Panauti municipalities were vaccinated after the detection of rabies in the area. It is said that the dogs in all 13 local levels of Kavre would be vaccinated and the sterilization program be gradually expanded to avert the possible risk of rabies.

[Travellers to Nepal deserve to be aware of getting exposed to rabid animals, in particular stray dogs, requiring receipt of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Rabies vaccine for PEP is available in Nepal; human rabies immune globulin (RIG) is available in specialty clinics in Kathmandu, but it is not widely available throughout the country. This may pose an issue for travellers outside of Kathmandu that have animal exposure if they are unable to travel to a specialty clinic. Since rabies can be found in various mammals in Nepal, travellers involved in outdoor activities, people working with or around animals, and people who are long-term travellers should be offered rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis. - Mod.AS

3] Israel: jackal, human exposure
Date: Wed 7 Jul 2021

Two people were attacked last week by jackals that were infected with rabies in the Western Galilee region. The recent attacks illustrate again the presence of the disease in the north of the country, which is why the Ministry of Health today [7 Jul 2021] issued a warning to travellers in the north from getting in contact with animals for fear of contracting the disease.

Since the beginning of the year [1 Jan 2021], 28 animals have been diagnosed with rabies, of which 26 [were] located in the northern region. In recent months there has been a significant increase in the number of rabid animals detected in the northern region. In March [2021] alone, 18 cases of rabies were reported in Galilee and Golan Heights.

Among the localities in the north where reports of rabies were received, one can find Rama, Beit Jan, Had Nes, Peki'in, Maayan-Baruch, Goren, Manot, Yaara and the Nahal Betzet Reserve [for a map, see commentary].

The last human case in Israel occurred in 2002. Most cases of rabies are detected near border areas. The source of the outbreak is to be sought in the introduction of rabid wild animals or stray dogs from neighboring countries: Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. Four years ago, when most of rabies cases were reported in Springs Valley and Gilboa [adjacent to the northern parts of the Jordan river], infected jackals came from Jordan. The infected animals are now arriving from Lebanon.

Unlike in neighboring countries, rabies has been controlled throughout Israel [mainly by compulsory vaccination of dogs and oral immunisation of wildlife]. The main factor that will determine whether the disease can spread and get re-established within Israel, or die out, is the density of wildlife populations, especially jackals and foxes.

It should be noted that confirming and publishing a case such as rabies is undertaken by the State Veterinary Services only if the brain of the suspected animals is received for examination at the laboratory of the Kimron Veterinary Institute and rabies confirmed.

Therefore, even if the behavior of the attacking animal -- usually a jackal or a dog -- is typical of a rabies-infected animal, it will not be counted as a rabies case if the attacking animal is not caught. Therefore, the actual number of rabies cases is, in fact, higher than the number of reported cases.

In an article published in Walla! last year [2020], Dr. Amit Dolev, the northern district ecologist at the Nature and Parks Authority, said that the main factor that helps wildlife populations thrive is the availability of food. "There is always animal intrusion into Israel. The problem is that here there is food that sustains them in the vicinity of poultry farms or when there is poor sanitation, and the carcasses and waste of animal farms are not properly treated or it remain in the field, or there are unregulated garbage sites, etc.

Dolev stressed at the time that, in addition to the availability of organic waste around the communities, food left in the field after picnics or left outside the garbage cans inside the communities will lead to growth of the carnivore wildlife population.

The Ministry of Health clarifies that in case a person is bitten or scratched or comes in contact with an animal, the wound should be immediately and thoroughly rinsed, applying running water and soap, disinfected with disinfectants, and the bitten person urgently contact the nearest health bureau to consider post-exposure prophylaxis. After work hours and during the weekend or holiday, go to the emergency room at the nearest hospital.

Plausibly, the virus is currently extensively circulating in neighbouring regions in southern Lebanon and southwestern Syria. - Mod.AS
