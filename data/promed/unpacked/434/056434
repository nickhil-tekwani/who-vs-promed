Sounds very much like another case of someone mistaking a wild mink for a ferret. I got called for a ferret rescue once that was a local wild mink in a window well. Everyone made out fine that time, though.

That is a rather common mistake to encounter. If the animal is black with a small white throat patch then it is most often a wild mink. Domestic ferrets can be bred to be very dark, but usually are not and even then, their coats are not as consistent as those of mink.

It sounds like someone grabbed the animal, which naturally resulted in bites and scratches, also like the police released it before learning of the injury.

By the way, because ferrets tend to die before they can have intact rabies virus reach the salivary glands, the last time I checked there still had never been anyone worldwide infected by a ferret. When strains of rabies were being tested in ferrets by the CDC there was one ferret who had a salivary gland viral fragment, though.

It may not be as big and scary as Big Foot, but a wild animal at the [Westerly, Rhode Island] local Walmart is at the center of a mystery that has captured public attention in the steamy days of summer.

Where did it come from? Where is it now? Did it attack 2 people at the store? How did it get inside the store? What exactly was it? Witnesses and investigators can't seem to agree about much having to do with the black mammal seen at the Post Road store on the Fourth of July [Mon 4 Jul 2016].

The police got a call just before 5 p.m. to report that a ferret loose at the store had been captured in a garbage can. An officer on the scene about 20 minutes later said that the ferret was actually a wild mink. Or maybe an ermine.

Store employees told the police that the animal may have bitten 2 customers, but none of them stuck around to talk to the police.

The animal wasn't acting "in a peculiar manner," according to Police Chief Edward W St Clair, so an officer transferred it from the garbage can into a cat carrier, took it to Old Carriage Road and released it. But 2 hours after the initial call, the police heard from Westerly Hospital, where a store employee sought treatment after saying the animal had bitten her. Employees thought it was a domesticated ferret and tried to capture it, and the woman was scratched and bit when she grabbed it.

Anyone who may have come in contact with the animal is asked to call the state Health Department at (401) 222-2577, in case the animal had rabies.

[Sukie's comments and this background report on the black mink that caused all this trouble makes a lot of sense, especially to those of us who have ever handled a frightened ferret. Which is not to diminish the possible risk of exposure to a rabid biting mink. Better be safe and vaccinated, than dismissive and dead. Thanks to Sukie. - Mod.MHJ
