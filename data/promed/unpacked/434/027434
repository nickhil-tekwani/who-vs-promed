Current anthrax outbreaks in South Africa [sic: February-March 2014]
Northern Cape Province
----------------------
During March 2014 there were reports of an unusual increase in deaths among sheep and goats in Sanddrift (Namakwa District), close to the Namibian border. Animal specimens were submitted to Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute for testing, and anthrax was confirmed as the cause of the outbreak. Of concern was that some residents in the area had slaughtered sick animals, and had potentially consumed anthrax-contaminated meat.

The last recorded animal anthrax outbreak in this area was in 2006, and occurred in Kuboes, a small town neighbouring Sanddrift. One human case of probable cutaneous anthrax was identified, and 19 persons exposed to anthrax-contaminated goat and sheep carcasses were given antibiotic prophylaxis and monitored.

Namakwa District Municipality health officials instituted active case finding at public health clinics, and no suspected human cases have been identified to date. Community health education began on 21 March 2014 at schools and within the community, to raise awareness of the disease and highlight preventive measures. The Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development has planned an animal anthrax vaccination campaign in response to the outbreak.

Northern Kruger National Park, Limpopo Province
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of anthrax among wildlife has been reported in the northern Pafuri area of the Kruger National Park. Although this area is known to be endemic for anthrax with wildlife cases reported every year, there was a sudden dramatic increase in the number of anthrax cases during February 2014. Affected wildlife species include impala, kudu, nyala, and Burchell's zebra. Since the outbreak is in a remote area of the park, it poses no risk to travelers.

Anthrax is endemic in parts of southern Africa and is commonly reported in livestock and wildlife. In 2013 and 2014, outbreaks have been reported in Namibia (human and animal cases), Zimbabwe (human and animal cases), Lesotho (human and animal cases), and the Kruger National Park, South Africa (animal cases only).

[Anthrax is a constant presence in the Northern Cape Province with reported livestock outbreaks back to 2001 (and probably beyond), viz. 2001, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2013. And anthrax has long been a chronic problem in the Kruger National Park (KNP) with the Pafuri with its own outbreaks, occasionally interrupted by flooding but they eventually recur there. Pafuri is the northernmost part of the KNP and is described by the Pafuri river. There are 2 relevant papers worth reading on anthrax in the KNP:
