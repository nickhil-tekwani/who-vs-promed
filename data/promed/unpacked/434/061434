The US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed 8 Jan 2019 virulent Newcastle disease in a 2nd commercial poultry flock in California. The latest case is in a commercial layer flock in Riverside County, APHIS said, and the finding is part of an outbreak in southern California that began in May 2018 in backyard exhibition birds.

Virulent Newcastle disease is not a food safety concern, the USDA said, and no human cases of Newcastle disease have ever occurred from eating poultry products. APHIS is working closely with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) to respond to the finding, limit the disease's spread in commercial poultry and then eradicate it. APHIS said federal and state partners are conducting additional surveillance and testing in the area and are working with nearby commercial farms to increase biosecurity to prevent additional disease spread.

The initial commercial case was reported 16 Dec 2018 in a flock of 110 000 6-week-old layer chickens in Riverside County, according to information submitted to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Information on the 2nd case has not yet appeared on the OIE website but is expected to in the next few days.

According to information from APHIS and CDFA, 231 cases of virulent Newcastle disease were reported in backyard birds between 18 May 2018 and 20 Dec 2018, but the tally has not been updated since then because of the partial governmental shutdown.

Virulent Newcastle disease is a contagious and fatal viral disease affecting the respiratory, nervous and digestive systems of birds and poultry, APHIS said. The disease is so virulent that many birds and poultry die without showing any clinical signs. A death rate of almost 100% can occur in unvaccinated poultry flocks. Virulent Newcastle disease can infect and cause death even in vaccinated poultry.

[2] 3rd commercial flock

The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed virulent Newcastle disease in a 3rd commercial poultry flock in California. The latest case is in a commercial layer flock in Riverside County. This finding is part of an outbreak in southern California that began in May 2018 in backyard exhibition birds.

Virulent Newcastle disease is not a food safety concern. No human cases of Newcastle disease have ever occurred from eating poultry products. Properly cooked poultry products are safe to eat. In very rare instances people working directly with sick birds can become infected. Symptoms are usually very mild, and limited to conjunctivitis and/or influenza-like symptoms. Infection is easily prevented by using standard personal protective equipment.

APHIS is working closely with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) to respond to the finding, limit the disease's spread in commercial poultry, and then eradicate it. Federal and state partners are conducting additional surveillance and testing in the area, and are working with nearby commercial farms to increase biosecurity to prevent additional disease spread.

It is essential that all bird owners follow good biosecurity practices to help protect their birds from infectious diseases. These include simple steps like washing hands and scrubbing boots before and after entering a poultry area, and cleaning and disinfecting tires and equipment before moving them off the property.

In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state and federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through USDA's toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. Additional information on biosecurity for all poultry flocks can be found at <www.aphis.usda.gov/animalhealth/defendtheflock>.

Virulent Newcastle disease is a contagious and fatal viral disease affecting the respiratory, nervous and digestive systems of birds and poultry. The disease is so virulent that many birds and poultry die without showing any clinical signs. A death rate of almost 100% can occur in unvaccinated poultry flocks. Virulent Newcastle disease can infect and cause death even in vaccinated poultry.

Clinical signs of virulent Newcastle disease include sudden death and increased death loss in the flock; sneezing; gasping for air; nasal discharge; coughing; greenish, watery diarrhea; decreased activity; tremors; drooping wings; twisting of the head and neck; circling; complete stiffness; and swelling around the eyes and neck.

[So within a matter of days there are 2 affected commercial flocks. This is very sad news. No producer/owner wants to have birds euthanized. However, very strict biosecurity must be practiced to prevent this from spreading any further. This includes any workers who may have birds of their own. If the privately owned flock is ill, then the worker needs to notify the commercial flock owner where the worker is employed. This is one way the disease may transfer between flocks.

What is very alarming is in 2003, the same disease, virulent Newcastle disease, often now called exotic Newcastle disease, started in backyard flocks, a euphemism for avian athletes or fighting birds, and moved to commercial flocks. We are seeing the same alarming pattern. To date there is not a plan for handling this situation. There has been no plan published or announced on how to keep this disease from spreading to many other commercial flocks as happened in 2003. I fear we are seeing a repeat of history. - Mod.TG
