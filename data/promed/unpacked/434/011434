Scientists working to control a human outbreak of monkeypox virus (MPXV) in Nigeria performed genetic sequencing of patient samples, revealing that the outbreak likely originated from a source within the country. Their results emphasize the value of local surveillance for the early detection of viral spillovers and the need for advanced genetic characterization to help determine the origins of outbreaks.

"Based on our findings, it appears that the index case of the current outbreak in Nigeria was not imported, but probably originated from a spillover event or events involving reservoir hosts," said Gustavo Palacios, Ph.D., who heads the Center for Genome Sciences at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. USAMRIID and a multinational team of collaborators published their analysis in a letter posted online this week [week of Sun 14 Jan 2018] in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

According to the World Health Organization, 172 suspected and 61 confirmed MPXV cases, including one death, were reported in different parts of Nigeria between [Mon 4 Sep - Sat 9 Dec 2017]. Prior to this outbreak, only 10 such cases had been reported in the region between 1971 and 1978. Due to this lapse and the recent cases in the Congo Basin, the origin of the latest Nigerian outbreak needed to be identified, as did whether the outbreak was a result of a local zoonotic spillover event or importation from another endemic country.

The research effort was supported by the Institut Pasteur in Dakar (IPD) in Senegal and the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency. Sequencing equipment was provided to IPD, where the sequencing was conducted, by the Targeted Acquisition of Reference Materials Augmenting Capabilities (TARMAC) initiative and the Defense Biological Product Assurance Office (DBPAO) through a task order award to the National Strategic Research Institute. Outbreak control teams were composed of staff from the Bayelsa State Ministry of Health, Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program, and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.

[The MPX virus clade involved in this outbreak is not mentioned. With just one reported fatality, and that one in an immunosuppressed individual, the West Africa clade may be the one involved in this outbreak. That clade has the lowest case fatality rate. The widespread nature of this monkeypox outbreak is unusual with 61 confirmed cases in 14 states. Human to human transmission is also unusual, with there being one published report of that occurring in the Republic of the Congo. The question remains about the source of these infections within Nigeria. The report above indicates that the MPXV of the index case was acquired within the country. With no cross-state relationships of cases and preliminary genetic sequencing suggesting multiple sources of introduction of monkeypox virus into human population, one wonders if there is a MPXV epizootic going on in rodent hosts across a relatively wide geographic area in the country. Studies of prevalence of MPXV in rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).
