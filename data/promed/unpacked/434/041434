Doctors in Albania say hundreds of people have fallen ill from harvesting cannabis in a lawless region that for years has been out of bounds to police, Albanian media reported on Friday [1 Nov 2013].

The hospital in the southern city of Gjirokaster said a total of 700 have sought treatment since June 2013 for the effects of planting, harvesting, pressing, and packing the cannabis in the village of Lazarat.

"In the last 2 months, about 7 to 8 people arrive in the emergency ward each day, and many more have come earlier with disorders from hashish," Gjirokaster doctor Hysni Lluka told Top Channel television.

Some 2000 people, including poor Roma who have set up a camp near Lazarat, have been working for months in the cannabis fields, where producers pay 8 euros [USD 11] per 10 kg of processed drug. The illegal practice has flourished in Lazarat over 2 decades of turbulent transition in Albania since the end of hard line communist rule.

Lazarat has become a byword for lawlessness in Albania, with cannabis growers brazen enough to shoot at police officers who venture near their fields. Aerial pictures suggest some 60 hectares have been cultivated in Lazarat, with 300 000 cannabis plants capable of yielding 500 tonnes or half the total cannabis production in Albania.

Lluka, the doctor, said women and teenagers, who account for some 40 percent of those working in Lazarat, had sought help for bouts of vomiting, stomach pain, irregular heart beats, and high blood pressure. Last week, one patient came in a critical state.

Lazarat is a stronghold of the Democratic Party, which was in power for 8 years before losing a June 2013 election to the Socialist Party. The Democrats promised to tackle Albania's cannabis problem, but police shied away from striking Lazarat. Artan Didi, the new director of police appointed by the Socialists, has said the police will no longer "back down to Lazarat."

The U.S. State Department's international narcotics control report for 2013 listed Albania as a transit and destination country for cannabis, heroin and cocaine.

Authorities seized more than 21 tonnes of cannabis in 2012, double the amount of the previous year, it said, although that could reflect increased production.

[The majority of this article sounds like an issue of production of cannabis and the lawlessness surrounding it.

_Cannabis sativa_ is the hemp plant from which marijuana (leaves, stems, seeds) are derived. The most potent form of this plant's extracts is hash oil, a liquid. The dried resins are referred to as "hashish."

More than 400 active compounds have been isolated from the _C. sativa_ plant. 60 active compounds are unique to the plant and are collectively known as cannabinoids. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannanbinol (THC) is the most psychoactive cannabinoid, producing euphoria, relaxation, intensification of ordinary sensory experiences, perceptual alterations, diminished pain, and difficulties with memory and concentration.

However, there is a small mention of sickness associated with this production. The clinical signs listed in the article (vomiting, stomach pain, irregular heart beats and high blood pressure) could be signs of the disorder known as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. I am not familiar with high blood pressure being in this syndrome, but it is entirely possible. This syndrome apparently does not require the ingestion or inhalation of the plant, but rather close association with the plant or the product for extended periods of time. This article does not state whether these individuals are using the product, as these symptoms can also develop from its use. Treatment may consist of time away from the harvesting fields, cessation of product use, and warm baths are reported to be very helpful with this syndrome.
