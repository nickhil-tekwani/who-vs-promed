[Ref: Y Martinez-Zubiaur et al: First report of _Tomato chlorosis
virus_ infecting tomato in single and mixed infections with _Tomato
yellow leaf curl virus_ in Cuba. Plant Dis 2008; 92(5), 836; DOI:
10.1094/PDIS-92-5-0836C]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whitefly-transmitted viruses have caused severe losses in tomato
crops in Cuba. In 2006 and 2007, tomato greenhouses across eastern
Cuba exhibited high levels of _Bemisia tabaci_ (B biotype)
infestation. Some plants showed interveinal chlorosis and a severe
yellow mosaic, combined with leaf brittleness. These symptoms were
different from those induced by _Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_
(TYLCV-IL(CU)).

Only 12 of 31 symptomatic samples resulted in positive PCR
[polymerase chain reaction] assays with TYLCV-specific primers. A
reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis for _Tomato chlorosis virus_
(ToCV) with generic and specific primers was also carried out.
Sequence analysis of the cloned RT-PCR products ['amplicons'] (463
basepairs) confirmed the presence of ToCV in Cuba. The fragment had
97 to 98 percent identity with isolates from Spain, Florida (USA),
and Reunion Island (France).

Cloned TYLCV and ToCV amplicons were used as probes to reanalyze the
selected 31 samples by a dot-blot hybridization assay [a diagnostic
method using labelled nucleotide sequences of the viruses as 'probes'
to detect the presence of similar sequences in the samples - Mod.DHA]
in search of mixed infections. The assay showed 16 samples to be
positive for ToCV, 4 for TYLCV, 8 for both, and 3 samples were
negative. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of ToCV and
TYLCV/ToCV mixed infections in Cuba.

[ToCV (genus _Crinivirus_) has been reported from Europe and a number
of locations in other parts of the world. Besides tomato, it can also
affect capsicum and some solanaceous weeds, which may serve as
pathogen reservoirs, as well as some ornamental and weed species in
other families. Symptoms on tomato leaves include irregular chlorotic
mottle, interveinal yellowing, necrotic flecks, and possible
distortions. No obvious symptoms develop on fruit and flowers, but
fruit size and numbers are reduced due to a loss of photosynthetic
area. Significant yield losses occur as a result, but symptom
severity varies with host cultivars. Symptoms may be confused with
nutritional problems and are also similar to those of the related
_Tomato infectious chlorosis virus_ (TICV).

TYLCV (genus _Begomovirus_) originates from the Middle East and is
one of the most damaging viruses of tomato worldwide. It can also
affect a number of other solanaceous and leguminous hosts. Infection
of tomato causes plants to be stunted with small chlorotic puckered
leaves. Yield losses of up to 80 percent have been reported, and
field cropping of tomatoes has been abandoned in some areas due to
TYLCV.

Both viruses are transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_
(ToCV also by 2 other whitefly species), and outbreaks are usually
associated with high vector populations. Disease management of
whitefly transmitted viruses is difficult and includes vector
control, removal of reservoirs of both virus and vectors, use of crop
varieties with increased pathogen tolerance, and clean planting
material. Both ToCV and TYLCV, as well as their vector _B. tabaci_
are included on the quarantine alert list of the European Plant
Protection Organisation (EPPO). For more information on ToCV and
TYLCV see previous ProMED-mail posts listed below.

Whiteflies have been reported to transmit over 100 virus species. _B.
tabaci_ is believed to be a species complex with a number of
recognised biotypes varying in their distribution and vector
activities. Whiteflies are a common problem in glasshouse grown
crops, and multiple infections with viruses sharing this vector are
not unusual. Co-infecting viruses may interact with a symbiotic
enhancement of symptoms (synergism), as appears to be the case here.
