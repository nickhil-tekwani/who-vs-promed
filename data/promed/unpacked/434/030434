Live pigeon needed to test for illness
-----------------------------------------------------
The City of San Angelo Animal Service wants to have a live pigeon
tested after receiving several reports of pigeons quickly dying in
downtown San Angelo, Texas.
Animal Service director Leslie Hart said the department has received
5 or 6 calls in the last 24 to 48 hours from citizens who have seen
"disoriented" pigeons that soon died. Witnesses described the pigeons
as "trying to fly, but can't," and that "can't find their balance,"
Hart said.
Animal services wants to capture a live pigeon that shows such signs,
Hart said. Once captured, the pigeon would be tested by a local
veterinarian.
"We don't know what it is, and we just want to get it checked out,"
she said. "to run the test."
