The 3 Rockland [Rockland County, New York State, USA] residents recovering from the potentially deadly legionnaires' disease are not a danger to other people and the disease is not spreading, the county health commissioner said on Tuesday [11 Aug 2015].

The infected people were isolated cases and there is no cluster of legionnaires' disease with a singular source, like in the South Bronx where 12 people have died and more than 100 have been infected, Rockland Health Department commissioner Patricia Schnabel Ruppert said. "People have nothing worry to about," Ruppert said. "They can go outside, they can go to the mall and shop. They can do all those things they normally do. We do not have a cluster." She said the 3 reported cases since [1 Jul 2015] are a typical amount for the county, which hears about a handful of cases annually.

Ruppert said there is no known source of the disease for 2 of the Rockland residents, including a man who worked at Chromalloy's manufacturing plant in Orangeburg. The 3rd person contracted the disease working in the South Bronx, and is likely counted among the cluster in the borough, she said. The Health Department learned of the 3 cases either through the state Health Department reporting system or infectious disease nurses at local hospitals, Ruppert said.

Signs of the disease include coughing, shortness of breath, high fever, muscle aches and headaches. People typically begin to experience symptoms 2 to 14 days after being exposed. Ruppert said the [bacterial organism, _Legionella_ species, that causes the] disease is found in the soil and water, including air conditioning systems, cooling towers, and hot tubs.

While the disease cannot be spread from one person to another, it can be contracted by breathing in the bacteria through a mist or vapor, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. Most people exposed to the bacteria do not become sick. Most of those who do contract the disease will become ill with pneumonia because the bacteria grows in their lungs, according to CDC. About 5 per cent to 30 per cent of cases result in death.

Chromalloy closed down its plant on [Fri 7 Aug 2015] at about 11:30 am after one of its workers was diagnosed with the disease. Industrial cleaners spent the weekend scrubbing and disinfecting the company's cooling towers and hot tubs, reopening the Blaisdel road plant on Monday morning [10 Aug 2015].

The Health Department has sent letters to businesses with cooling towers and more than 15 employees to encourage them to disinfect their facilities -- including air-conditioning, heating, and ventilation systems. The department also contacted doctors across the county to be on the lookout for legionnaires' disease symptoms.

The Health Department has been working with the US Labor Department Occupational Safety & Health Administration and other agencies.

US representative Nita Lowey, D-Harrison, sent a letter to CDC director Tom Frieden on [Mon 10 Aug 2015] asking him to be responsive to any requests for assistance from Rockland and other suburban health departments.

[Legionnaires' disease is reportable in the US. Because diseases are usually reported by county of residence, one of the Rockland County cases of legionnaires' disease linked to the South Bronx was unlikely to have been reported among the Bronx County cases.

One of the Rockland County cases that worked at the Chromalloy plant was said in the news report above not to be linked to any source. Nevertheless, the Chromalloy plant was closed down on Fri 8 Aug 2015 and its cooling towers and hot tubs were cleaned. Was legionella isolated from the Chromalloy cooling towers and hot tubs and did the genotypes of any environmental isolates match that of the clinical isolates?

More information from knowledgeable sources on the reported outbreak of legionnaires' disease in Rockland County would be greatly appreciated.

The state of New York can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3577511,4302. Rockland County, with a population of over 300 000 in 2010, is the southernmost county on the west side of the Hudson River in the US state of New York and part of the New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area.
