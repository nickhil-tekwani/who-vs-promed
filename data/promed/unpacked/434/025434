While Southeast Asia is now struggling to contain the Zika virus after the disease outbreak in South America last year [2015] has reached our shores, another disease seems to have made its way in the opposite direction. Scrub typhus, a deadly disease common in Southeast Asia and spread by microscopic biting mites known as chiggers, has now taken hold in a part of South America and may have become endemic there, scientists said yesterday [7 Sep 2016].

The tropical disease, which kills at least 140 000 people a year in the Asia Pacific region, has been confirmed in a cluster of cases on a large island off Chile, some 12 000 km [about 7500 miles] from its usual haunts on the other side of the Pacific. Scrub typhus has been known of for years and the bacterium that causes it was 1st identified in Japan in 1930. It is caused by the bacterium _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, transmitted by chiggers, and spreads through the lymphatic fluid.

Those infected find the illness can begin quite suddenly, with shaking chills, fever, severe headache, infection of the mucous membrane in the eyes, and lymph node swelling.

Until 2006, scrub typhus was thought to be limited to an area called the "tsutsugamushi triangle", from Pakistan in the west to far eastern Russia in the east to northern Australia in the south. But writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers from Britain's Oxford University and the Pontificia Universidad Catolica and Universidad del Desarrollo in Chile the cases found off of Chile's mainland "suggest there may be a much wider global distribution than previously understood [1]."

In 2006, 2 cases of scrub typhus were found outside the triangle. One, in the Middle East, was caused by a previously unrecorded bacterium related to [_O.] tsutsugamushi_ and named _Orientia chuto_. The 2nd was found on Chiloé Island, just off mainland Chile. In January 2015 and again in early 2016, 3 more cases were discovered in Ancud, on the northern coast of Chiloé.

"Scrub typhus is a common disease but a neglected one," said Paul Newton, director of the Lao-Oxford-Mahosot Hospital Wellcome Trust Research Unit, which collaborated in the study. "Given that it is known to cause approximately a million clinical cases, and kills at least 140 000 people each year, this evidence of an even bigger burden of disease in another part of the world highlights the need for more research and attention to it."
