Ban on Importation of Horses and Birds from France
--------------------------------------------------
RIYADH: Saudi Arabia banned importation of horses and birds from France
yesterday [Sat 9 Dec 2000 over fears of a possible spread of West Nile
virus to the Kingdom, the official Saudi Press Agency reported. It quoted
the Agriculture Ministry as saying the ban was prompted by "cases of horses
affected by West Nile disease, which affects humans and animals in some
parts of France."
It was not immediately clear whether the decision would affect frozen
poultry imports. Saudi Arabia imports some 40 percent of its chicken,
mostly from Brazil and Europe. The country imported an estimated 300 000
tons of chicken in 1998. France has reported cases of horses affected by
West Nile virus in October [2000 in the southern Camargue marshlands, a
major horse-breeding region.
The ministry had banned [previously the importation of horses and birds
from the US State of New York and from Jordan late last month. That order
also followed a report from the Food and Agriculture Organization that said
West Nile fever cases had been detected in these regions. West Nile virus
naturally infects birds and is spread by mosquitoes, which can also carry
it to people. Saudi Arabia is at present battling an outbreak of Rift
Valley fever, another viral disease transmitted from infected livestock to
humans, which has killed 108 people in the Kingdom and at least 97 people
in neighboring Yemen.

Comments on the Above Report
----------------------------
This importation ban is a welcome step. It is to be hoped, however, that it
will lead to more surveillance aimed at giving a better picture of the
situation on the ground [in order to achieve more scientifically-based
public health decisions. The [report in Arab News raises some important
issues:
1. The [scientific basis for the ban on the import of equines and birds
[from the US State of New York alone is not fully understood. Why New York
state alone? For one [thing, by mid-September there had been at least 9
confirmed equine cases [including cases from Connecticut and New Jersey
while New York had only one case, the same as Rhode Island and
Massachusetts. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), by Nov 2000, viral activity had been reported in 12 states. There
has also been clearly-detected viral activity in other mammals, including
bats. In light of these facts, the singling out of New York is not fully
understood.
2. The availability of [facilities, especially at the border points, for
[adequate surveillance of imported equines and birds [is open to doubt.
3. It is often asserted that equines are basically a dead-end host. However
the potential and real vector ecology [in this region may require more
study. The outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in the US has
increased interest in [the potential of mosquito species such as _Aedes
japonicus_ [as a vector in the transmission of WNV. Can this [species and
perhaps other overlooked mosquito species and perhaps other arthropods do
the same here? The local availability of the new specific real-time PCR
method for detection of West Nile virus [would facilitate such research.
Such tests may be useful in tracing the origin of any WNV if and when detected.
4. Local epidemiological and surveillance studies [should be widened to
include study of vector competence for other arboviral [diseases (e.g.,
Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever and perhaps Dengue
Fever) that are already active in the region. Falconry, which is highly
popular in the Middle East, would benefit from an
epidemiologically-prepared response system.
5. Migratory birds, said to contribute to the incidence of WNV infection in
Israel, fly over much of this region. It should be ascertained whether
these birds are carriers of WNV.
6. The possibility of importation of human cases from Jordan (either [as
normal visitors or as pilgrims) or even from the US should not be ruled out.
7. [If chickens are infected, the possibility of transmission via
consumption of frozen poultry should be investigated.
