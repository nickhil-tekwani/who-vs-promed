Godhra town in Gujarat's Panchmahal district has reported 12 cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome or GBS, a rare disease, a health official said on Thursday [24 Feb 2022]. These 12 cases were reported in a span of around a week and the district health administration has started surveillance of the entire Bhuravav area, where they were detected, to find out what led to the disease among locals, Chief District Health Officer CDHO, Dr Meenakshi Chauhan, said.

Seven cases of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) -- a clinical syndrome defined by the acute onset of weakness or paralysis with reduced muscle tone, especially in children -- have been reported from Godhra since [19 Feb 2022], the health department of Gujarat's Panchmahal district has informed the state government.

Three other suspected patients, including 2 children and a 23-year-old woman, have died, said officials.

The health department is also monitoring 12 suspected AFP cases, including the 7 confirmed patients. Ten of them have been shifted to hospitals in Vadodara, said officials. Of the 7 confirmed cases, 6 are children aged between 3 and 12 and the other a 22-year-old man.

The report sent to the state health department states that all 7 cases -- 4 from the area of Bhuravav and 1 each from Dharapura, Lunawada Road, and SRP group in Godhra -- have been tested for AFP as per the National Polio Surveillance Project (NPSP) guidelines.

Dr Minakshi Chauhan, chief district health officer (CDHO), Panchmahal district, told The Indian Express that stool samples of the suspected patients had been sent for testing. "We are awaiting results of the samples. At this point, we cannot confirm if the cause of AFP is Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS - a rare neurological disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks part of its peripheral nervous system) but the symptoms appear to be so... We have begun surveillance work in the affected area of Godhra town where people are reporting muscle weakness and feeling of pins-and-needles, gastric issues and even paralysis of the lower body. It could have been caused by a bacterial or viral infection but we are yet to ascertain the exact cause."

Chauhan said that the 1st case in the district came to light on [Sat 19 Feb 2022] and the district department swung into action on Monday [21 Feb 2022] after more patients in the area reported symptoms, particularly children and youth. Chauhan added that although the condition is not contagious, the district administration is working at ascertaining the cause of the spread.

Of the 7 confirmed cases, a 6-year-old from Godhra, who is currently admitted at the SSG hospital in Vadodara, is said to be stable. The district administration is now conducting a COVID-19 antibody test on children who have reported AFP symptoms to establish any link with coronavirus as the region had seen a surge during the 3rd wave in January [2022].

World Health Organisation (WHO) defines AFP syndrome as characterised by a "rapid onset of weakness of an individual's extremities, often including weakness of the muscles of respiration and swallowing, progressing to maximum severity within 1-10 days."

The term 'flaccid' indicates the absence of spasticity or other signs of disordered central nervous system (CNS) motor tracts such as hyperlexia, clonus, or extensor plantar responses.

[An excellent fact sheet on GBS covering clinical and epidemiologic background information can be found at the National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Guillain-Barr%C3%A9-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet).

GBS is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system with resultant sensory and motor losses. There is a very high recovery rate in past days cited as 90% without residual paralysis, but more recently cited as 70%. It has most often been identified temporally associated with an infectious process, usually gastrointestinal (campylobacter infections) or respiratory and following Zika virus infection. It has also been identified following a vaccination (see GBS following swine flu vaccination in 1976 at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/guillain-barre-syndrome.html). Refer to the 'See Also' section of this report below to see the various infections and vaccinations associated with increases in GBS occurrence.

Presenting symptoms include tingling in feet or hands followed by motor weakness resulting in walking difficulties. It can progress to involve the muscles of the diaphragm and require intubation to assist with breathing.

GBS is often an alternative diagnosis for non-polio acute flaccid paralysis. And here's where the challenge comes in. In pre-eradication initiative years, oftentimes a polio outbreak was first called an outbreak of GBS. Hence the collection of specimens mentioned in the above media reports -- to rule out polio as the etiology of these cases of AFP. But adding to more recent challenges, GBS has been associated with COVID-19 -- following infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. One wonders if PCRs for viral DNA were also done in these cases.

An interesting finding while searching for more information on this outbreak was a report of a GBS outbreak in Gujarat, India in late October 2021 (see https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-civil-hospital-guillain-barre-syndrome-cases-7591027/). A different district but suggestive of something going on in the State.

For a map of Gujarat, India showing districts see https://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/gujarat/gujarat.htm. Note that the October 2021 report came from Ahmedabad in the north central region of the state, and Godhra is in Panchmahal in the north east of the state separated by one district from Ahmedabad.

ProMED would greatly appreciate receiving information on the results of the laboratory studies as well as the epidemiologic investigation.
