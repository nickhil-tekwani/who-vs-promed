TB spreading through wildlife
------------------------------
Bovine tuberculosis has spread further into wildlife populations than was
previously thought, according to the findings of a newly published report.
The report entitled 'The Risk To Cattle From Wildlife Species Other Than
Badgers In Areas Of High Herd Breakdown Risk' was published last week (9
Jul 2004) amid allegations that its findings were so controversial DEFRA
had chosen to release it quietly.
Carried out by the Central Science Laboratory, the study revealed that
"deer could pose a significant risk" of spreading bovine TB to cattle and
that other wildlife species were infected.
The CSL's 4-year study in 7 English counties is the largest systematic
survey for _M. bovis_ ever carried out in the UK.
It involved investigating nearly 5000 carcasses and, while prevalence of
the disease was greater in badgers, risks posed by deer should no longer be
overlooked, it stated.
The report estimated the UK deer population -- including farmed deer -- to
be between 1.25 million and 2.6 million, compared with about 300 000
badgers. Between 1 and 15 percent (12 500-390 000) of the deer could be
infected with bovine TB.
While 4.4 percent of the 504 fallow deer tested displayed symptoms, 16
percent of whole carcasses available tested positive.
The report also noted that deer were particularly vulnerable to bovine TB
and often shared pasture, feed and water troughs with cattle.
The report was critical of the government, its predecessor, and DEFRA and
its predecessor MAFF.
The ministry knew of the high susceptibility of deer to TB 10 years ago but
only recently had DEFRA taken action.
MAFF left 2 herds of deer on the same premises under movement restrictions
for 11 years after bovine TB was found in a red deer hind. MAFF declined to
examine the carcasses of the deer when they were culled after
foot-and-mouth in 2001, but owners' private tests revealed likely bovine TB
in more than 30 percent of stock, it said.
The National Federation of Badger Groups' chief executive Elaine King said
it was strange the report had been posted on the DEFRA website late with no
press release or briefing.
"It's now quite clear that bovine TB is endemic in wildlife across the UK,"
said Dr King.
The study confirmed the presence of TB in certain species and showed it had
spread to the yellow-necked mouse, wood mouse, shrew, polecat, muntjac and
stoat.

Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: 13th Report for
Session 2003-2004, 13 Jul 2004 - Bovine TB
-------------------------------------------------
Summary
Bovine TB has been, at least until very recently, a growing problem in the
United Kingdom. It is a disease which not only brings suffering to animals
but adversely affects farmers in economic and other terms.
If culling badgers, held to be at the root of the problem, is Government's
'Plan A', in this inquiry we looked primarily at the measures which might
make up a 'Plan B' response to the problem. Our focus has been vaccination
of cattle and badgers; the gamma interferon test; husbandry; trace
elements; and the lessons to be learnt from Ireland. We have reviewed
developments in all these areas, and have made recommendations about these
aspects of 'Plan B'.
Our conclusion is that a decision about culling badgers must await the
outcome of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial. But there are a number of
promising steps forward that might be taken now. We recommend that
- the government move quickly to testing vaccination in badgers;
- assessment of the gamma interferon test be completed urgently, and the
government pay incentives to farmers to recruit them to the current field
trial;
- if the gamma interferon test proves efficacious it should be adopted, and
policy should be adapted to its use, particularly in terms of movement
restrictions on cattle;
- research into cattle vaccines should continue, and that greater effort
and resources be devoted to such research.
We also recommend that farmers take note of the Minister's comments about
good animal husbandry and take steps to ensure that they follow best practice.
