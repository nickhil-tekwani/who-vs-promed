Data released on Saturday [5 Apr 2014] revealed that the number of cases of the sexually transmitted disease syphilis exceeded 1000 last year [2013] for the 1st time since current statistics began [in 2000], reports the Sankei Shimbun [6 Apr 2014].

According to the Tokyo branch of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, the number of cases recorded in 2013 totaled [more than 1000], an increase by 40 per cent over the year before [2012]. In 2010, the total number was 621, a figure that has jumped in each of the 3 subsequent years.

Of those infected last year [2013], 989 were men, with the majority being between the age of 25 and 39.

The institute, which began keeping records of patient infections in 2000, indicated that the cause of the increase in cases is unknown but speculates that the increase is due to sexual contact between males.

"Many patients have had sexual contact between the same men," said Makoto Onishi, the head of the 1st bacterial infection research division of the institute. "It is probable that syphilis entered such a community."

Syphilis, which is caused by a bacterium that enters through wounded skin or mucous membranes, can be treated with antibiotics like penicillin. Initial symptoms include skin rashes but neurological problems can possibly follow in later stages.

Onishi said that abnormalities in skin color and composition should not be ignored. "To prevent spreading, it is best to be treated at an early stage," said the researcher. "We hope people will undergo testing at the hospital without hesitation."

[According to the news report above, the incidence of syphilis has increased presumably for Japan as a whole in the past several years and over 95 per cent of cases are men. Tokyo's branch of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases speculates that this increase is due to "sexual contact between males".

The presumed increase in syphilis in Japan due to men who have sex with men (MSM) is similar to the situation in the US and other countries, as reported in past ProMED-mail posts listed below. In the US in 2012, 75 per cent of the reported primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis cases were among MSM (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/), where the incidence rate for primary and secondary syphilis for the country as a whole was 5.0 per 100 000 population (15 667 cases) and the incidence rate for all stages of syphilis was 16.0 per 100 000 (49 903 cases) (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/tables/24.htm).

The incidence rate of syphilis (the stage of disease is not specified in the news report above) for Japan as a whole (about 1000 cases in a population of 127.6 million people, or 0.78 per 100 000) in 2013 is much lower than that in the US. Men developing a sexually transmitted disease from having sex with other men may be so highly stigmatized in Japan that many cases may go undiagnosed and unreported; so the actual incidence rate may be higher than the reported rate (http://idsc.nih.go.jp/iasr/23/266/tpc266.html). See also http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_information/dissemination/echi/docs/syphilis_en.pdf.

Reported increases in incidence of infectious syphilis among MSM in the US have been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently, use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site. Grindr allows users to quickly arrange anonymous hookups with other men using the mobile device's global positioning system (GPS) location-based services to show men nearby who are also on Grindr. The increases in syphilis in the US have been attributed in part to "HIV prevention fatigue" -- that is, diminished motivation to practice safer sex.

Whether the recent increased incidence of syphilis in Japan is linked to use of mobile phone apps, drugs, Internet chart rooms, or co-infection with HIV is not mentioned in the news report above. However, according to the founder of Grindr, Tokyo is Grindr's 4th largest city, after New York, Los Angeles, and London (http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/04/grindr-the-new-sexual-revolution). - Mod.ML
