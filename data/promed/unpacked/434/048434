According to HINA [Information Service], a couple from the central Kosovo
town of Malisevo have died of hemorrhagic fever contracted from tick bites.
The husband died in a hospital in Pristina on Thursday [27 May 2009], and
his wife, who had the same symptoms, passed away 2 days ago.

Several members of the same family have been admitted to the same hospital
but are not in a serious condition, although they are also suffering from
this type of fever, known as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF).

This season [2009], 157 patients with CCHF symptoms have asked for medical
aid, and 27 of them have been hospitalized. CCHF outbreaks have been
reported in Malisevo and Klina and another 4 municipalities in central Kosovo.

Risk of it spreading rises with summer heat and a growing frequency of tick
bites. The Pristina hospital has said it has sufficient amounts of drugs
for treating this disease, advising people to avoid places where they can
be bitten by ticks.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever was first registered in Kosovo in 1957 and
has claimed the lives of dozens of people since then, the local media reported.

An inhabitant of the village of Mlecane near Malisevo has become the 2nd
victim of hemorrhagic fever in Kosovo, local media reports. Kosovo media
states that the man's wife died of the same illness 3 days ago. Both died
at the University Clinical Center in Pristina, while their daughter is in
the same clinic, though doctors say her condition is stable.

According to the deceased's son, his father was bitten by ticks while he
was tending to cattle. Villagers say that this disease has been present for
several years now, and that is very worrying for the whole region. "The
same thing happens every year, and every year we have victims," said a
relative, adding that no protective measures had been applied other than
warnings to children at school. Following the latest death, the Hygiene
Institute has taken statements from the family; the site of the infection
has been located, and the family's yard and the surrounding area have been
sprayed.
