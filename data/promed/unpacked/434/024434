But uptake by patients and physicians has been low in the United States, where some therapies have been authorized for months.

Two clinical trials suggest that specific antibody treatments can prevent deaths and hospitalizations among people with mild or moderate COVID-19 -- particularly those who are at high risk of developing severe disease.

One study found that an antibody against the coronavirus developed by Vir Biotechnology in San Francisco, California, and GSK, headquartered in London, reduced the chances of hospitalization or death among participants by 85%. In another trial, a cocktail of 2 antibodies -- bamlanivimab and etesevimab, both made by Eli Lilly of Indianapolis, Indiana -- cut the risk of hospitalization and death by 87%.

The study results, both announced on [10 Mar 2021], come from randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials, but have not yet been published. They add to a growing body of evidence that the treatments can help fend off severe disease when administered early, says Derek Angus, an intensive-care physician at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. The antibodies "appear to be incredibly effective", he says. "I'm very excited about the results of these trials."

The body's natural response to viral infection is to generate a variety of antibodies, some of which are able to directly interfere with the virus's ability to replicate. In the early days of the pandemic, researchers raced to identify the antibodies that are most effective against the coronavirus and to produce them in bulk. The resulting 'monoclonal antibodies' have since been tested in a variety of settings as treatments for COVID-19.

Vir and GSK's antibody, called VIR-7831, was first isolated in 2003 from someone recovering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is caused by a similar coronavirus. The antibody was later found to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 'spike' protein, too. The companies also announced that in laboratory studies(1), VIR-7831 bound to SARS-CoV-2 variants -- including the fast-spreading 501Y.V2 variant (also called B.1.351) first identified in South Africa. They attributed the resilience of the antibody to its target: a particular region of the spike protein that does not tend to accumulate mutations.

Low uptake
----------
VIR-7831 joins a list of monoclonal antibodies that have been tested against COVID-19, some of which -- including Lilly's combination -- have already been authorized for use in the United States and elsewhere. But there has been relatively little uptake by US physicians and their patients, says Angus.

One problem, he says, is that although results have been press released and submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration, companies have yet to publish data from key clinical trials in peer-reviewed journals. The drugs are also expensive and must be administered by infusion in a specialized facility, such as a hospital or outpatient-treatment centre -- a difficult task when medical resources have already been stretched by a surge in cases.

Another challenge has been mixed messaging. Earlier in the pandemic, some key clinical trials involving people who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 found no benefit from monoclonal antibodies. Many researchers had anticipated that result: monoclonal-antibody therapy is expected to work best early in disease, and the late-stage symptoms of severe COVID-19 are sometimes driven more by the immune system itself than by the virus.

Even so, those clinical-trial failures created a narrative that competed with positive results in studies of milder infections, says Angus, fuelling scepticism. "People would say, 'But I thought it didn't work,'" he says. "It's totally getting in the way." And although studies in mild infections have shown promise, they are too small to allow researchers to draw definitive conclusions, says Saye Khoo, a pharmacologist at the University of Liverpool, UK, who is leading the UK AGILE Coronavirus Drug Testing Initiative. Only a small fraction of people with mild COVID-19 will progress to severe disease, meaning that although the trials have enrolled hundreds of participants, the number of those who were hospitalized or died was low.

But it will be a long wait until everyone is vaccinated, and monoclonal antibodies could provide an important bridge between vaccines and the treatments that have been found for people who are hospitalized, says Jens Lundgren, an infectious-disease physician at the University of Copenhagen and Rigshospitalet. "It is not a replacement for vaccines, but it is a plan B," he says, adding that the drugs could be particularly important for those who cannot mount an immune response to vaccination.

The speed with which these monoclonal antibodies were developed holds a lesson for future pandemics, says Khoo. "These compounds are without a doubt exciting," he says. "We shouldn't forget this, because there will be other pandemics coming to us. This has been a real lesson in how to be prepared."

["It has been more than 3 decades since the 1st monoclonal antibody was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 1986, and during this time, antibody engineering has dramatically evolved. Current antibody drugs have increasingly fewer adverse effects due to their high specificity. As a result, therapeutic antibodies have become the predominant class of new drugs developed in recent years."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Memory B cell reserves can generate protective antibodies against repeated SARS-CoV-2 infections, but with an unknown reach from original infection to antigenically drifted variants. We charted memory B cell receptor-encoded monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from 19 COVID-19 convalescent subjects against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and found 7 major mAb competition groups against epitopes recurrently targeted across individuals. Inclusion of published and newly determined structures of mAb-S complexes identified corresponding epitopic regions. Group assignment correlated with cross-CoV-reactivity breadth, neutralization potency, and convergent antibody signatures. mAbs that competed for binding the original S isolate bound differentially to S variants, suggesting the protective importance of otherwise-redundant recognition. The results furnish a global atlas of the S-specific memory B cell repertoire and illustrate properties conferring robustness against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Discussion
----------
Our results illustrate the landscape of memory B cell coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein in convalescent donors. Unlike the terminally differentiated plasma cells that determine the profile of serum antibodies, memory B cells will clonally expand upon re-exposure to antigen, some differentiating into fresh antibody secreting cells and others re-entering germinal centers and undergoing further SHM [somatic hypermutation]-mediated diversification and affinity maturation. These outcomes offer a layer of flexibility for adaptation to drifted or related viral strains, if available secreted antibodies fail to prevent initial infection. Loss of protection against overt or severe disease is not an inevitable consequence of a waning serum antibody titer. This atlas of B cell memory therefore maps systematically a crucial component of the long-term immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Complementary recognition of non-overlapping viral targets by non-competing antibodies in the repertoire can reduce the likelihood of viral escape. Our data suggest an additional mechanism for preventing viral escape: competing antibodies may help retain recognition of a rapidly evolving antigen by their differential sensitivity to specific mutations.

The emergence of strains that may have gained selective advantage by escape from neutralization emphasizes the importance of determining whether the level of retained affinity for the S protein by some antibodies in the immunodominant clusters influences protection from clinical disease.

[An earlier study found that "spike-specific memory B cells were more abundant at 6 months than at 1 month after symptom onset. Their results indicated "memory B cells specific for the Spike protein or RBD were detected in almost all COVID-19 cases, with no apparent half-life at 5-8 months post-infection. Other studies of RBD [receptor binding domain] memory B cells are reporting similar findings. B cell memory to some other infections has been observed to be long-lived, including 60+ years after smallpox vaccination (61), or 90+ years after infection with influenza (62)." See Dan JM, Mateus J, Kato Y, et al. Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection. Science. 2021 Feb 5; 371(6529): eabf4063. doi: 10.1126/science.abf4063; https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6529/eabf4063.long.

The report discussed above on the B cell repertoire presents an "atlas of B cell memory" which "maps systematically a crucial component of the long-term immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection." This is important for increasing understanding of the protective response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. - Mod.LK]

Ref: Britton A, Jacobs Slifka KM, Edens C, et al. Effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine among residents of two skilled nursing facilities experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks -- Connecticut, December 2020-February 2021. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 15 Mar 2021
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
Skilled nursing facility (SNF) residents, generally older and with more underlying medical conditions than community-dwelling adults, were not included in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. Little is known about COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in SNF residents.

What is added by this report?
A retrospective cohort analysis in 2 Connecticut SNFs found partial vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (from >14 days after dose 1 through 7 days after dose 2) to be 63% (95% confidence interval = 33%-79%) effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Even with partial vaccination, Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine provides protection to SNF residents. To optimize vaccine impact among this population, high coverage with the complete 2-dose series is recommended.

----
Residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs), particularly those in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), have experienced disproportionately high levels of COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality and were prioritized for early COVID-19 vaccination. However, this group was not included in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, and limited postauthorization vaccine effectiveness (VE) data are available for this critical population. It is not known how well COVID-19 vaccines protect SNF residents, who typically are more medically frail, are older, and have more underlying medical conditions than the general population. In addition, immunogenicity of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was found to be lower in adults aged 65-85 years than in younger adults. Through the CDC Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program, SNF residents and staff members in Connecticut began receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on [18 Dec 2020]. Administration of the vaccine was conducted during several on-site pharmacy clinics. In late January 2021, the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CT DPH) identified 2 SNFs experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks among residents and staff members that occurred after each facility's 1st vaccination clinic. Partial vaccination, defined as the period from >14 days after the 1st dose through 7 days after the 2nd dose, had an estimated effectiveness of 63% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 33%-79%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection (regardless of symptoms) among residents within these SNFs. This is similar to estimated effectiveness for a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in adults across a range of age groups in noncongregate settings and suggests that to optimize vaccine impact among this population, high coverage with the complete 2-dose series should be recommended for SNF residents and staff members.

A total of 463 residents were enrolled, including 142 (31%) from facility A and 321 (69%) from facility B. Demographic characteristics such as age and race were similar in residents at each facility (although ethnicity could not be reported because ethnicity data were missing for 30% of residents); prevalences of underlying conditions that increase the risk for severe COVID-19 illness were also similar in residents at each facility (Table). The median number of high-risk conditions per resident was 3; 5 (1.1%) residents had no underlying high-risk conditions. Among the 463 residents, 115 (24.8%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection before the investigation period; 2 of 34 (6%) residents at facility A and 68 of 81 (84%) residents at facility B with past confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection had a positive test result ≤3 months prior to investigation start.

During the investigation period, 97 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred, including 40 (41%) at facility A and 57 (59%) at facility B (Figure 1). Including nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, lethargy, and decreased appetite, at least one COVID-19 symptom was reported in 86 (88.7%) cases.

Discussion
----------
Partial vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was 63% effective in preventing new SARS-CoV-2 infections in SNF residents, a disproportionately affected population excluded from initial preauthorization vaccine clinical trials. Even during a large disease outbreak in a long-term care setting, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine provided protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, including in older adults aged ≥65 years with a high prevalence of underlying medical conditions. The findings in this report are comparable to other 1st-dose vaccine efficacy and effectiveness estimates for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the broader adult population in noncongregate settings. In the phase 3 clinical trial, efficacy during the interval between 1st and 2nd doses was estimated at 52% (95% CI = 30%-68%). In a recent study of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Israel, effectiveness against PCR-confirmed infection in the general adult population during days 14-20 and 21-27 after the 1st dose was 46% (95% CI = 40%-51%) and 60% (95% CI = 53%-66%, respectively)(6). Effectiveness was somewhat lower during days 14-20 and 21-27 among persons aged ≥70 years (22%; 95% CI = -9%-44% and 50%; 95% CI = 19%-72%, respectively) and among those with 3 or more underlying medical conditions (37%; 95% CI = 12%-55% and 37%; 95% CI = -1-62%).
In this investigation, nearly 25% of residents had confirmed past SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serologic studies have indicated that preexisting immunity might strengthen the response to a single dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. A sensitivity analysis excluding person-time contributed by residents with confirmed past infections did not substantially alter VE estimates for residents receiving the 1st vaccine dose. Among residents in this investigation with past confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 1st-dose vaccination rates were >90%, and only one reinfection was documented, limiting the ability to determine the impact of past infection.

Findings from this retrospective cohort analysis demonstrate that partial vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was associated with a significant reduction in the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection among SNF residents. These results, coupled with the findings from a previous study among comparable older adult populations in Israel that reported more robust protection after the 2nd dose, suggest that complete 2-dose vaccination is an important strategy for preventing COVID-19 in this disproportionately affected population. Further study of this population should continue as larger sample sizes become available. LTCFs and jurisdictions should actively ensure that they have plans in place for continued allocation and administration of COVID-19 vaccines to residents and staff members.

The Israeli studies have been covered on ProMED (see COVID-19 update (81): transmission, reinfection, vaccine and case severity, WHO 20210227.8216798 and COVID-19 update (75): rapid testing, Israel vaccine results, WHO, global 20210222.8205363). While the effectiveness in preventing disease following 1 dose in this outbreak was 63%, highlighting the need to ensure 2 doses are given, the study did not mention the severity of illness comparing vaccinated individuals with non-vaccinated individuals to know if severity was impacted as seen in Israel. There is use of the terms efficacy and effectiveness with respect to the vaccines. Efficacy refers to how well a vaccine, works under controlled circumstance such as a clinical trial. Effectiveness refers to how well that vaccine works in the real world. "Vaccine efficacy: % reduction in disease incidence in a vaccinated group compared to an unvaccinated group under optimal conditions (such as RCT [randomized controlled trial]). Vaccine effectiveness: the ability of vaccine to prevent outcomes of interest in the "real world"" (https://www.who.int/influenza_vaccines_plan/resources/Session4_VEfficacy_VEffectiveness.PDF). Effectiveness has less stringent study criteria. A 63% effectiveness following a 1st dose, while less than ideal is still impressive, remembering that the criteria established for acceptance of the vaccines was an efficacy ≥50%. - Mod.MPP]

Thailand on Monday [15 Mar 2021] recorded one death from COVID-19, raising the toll to 87, along with 78 new cases, bringing the accumulated total since the start of the pandemic to 27 005. The 78 new cases included 59 found through active testing.

Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) assistant spokeswoman Apisamai Srirangson said the new fatality was an 88-year-old man who died on Saturday [13 Mar 2021]. He had lived near Pornpat Market in Pathum Thani's Thanyaburi district, an area that became a COVID-19 hotspot last month [February 2021]. The deceased man's family members were vendors at the market, Dr Apisamai said, but they showed no COVID-19 symptoms. The virus might have been transmitted by friends or acquaintances who visited him after going to the market.

Of the 59 cases found through mass testing, 36 were in Samut Sakhon, 22 in Bangkok, and one in Pathum Thani, according to centre figures. Hospital reports revealed 9 new cases in Tak, 3 in Samut Sakhon, and one each in Bangkok, Samut Prakan, and Suphan Buri.

Monday's [15 Mar 2021] caseload included only 4 cases imported from overseas, one each from Myanmar, the United Arab Emirates, Poland, and Bahrain.

Dr Apisamai said the situation at Bang Khae Market in Bang Khae district was a major concern for the centre, although the situation was under control. Swab tests from the market on almost 1000 people found 107 were infected, she added. Mass testing concentrated on Wonder, one of the 6 markets in the Bang Khae market compound.

The spokesperson urged vendors and shoppers at markets around the country to keep their guard up as they would be vulnerable to contracting the virus if the markets did not meet hygiene standards and face masks were overlooked.

Health officials in 4 provinces have been ordered to monitor people linked with the new coronavirus hotspot at Bang Khae Market. Disease Control Department director-general Opas Karnkawinpong said on Sunday [14 Mar 2021] health personnel in Suphan Buri, Nakhon Pathom, Phetchaburi, and Samut Sakhon [provinces] were assigned to closely follow up the cases after the department had sent the names and personal details to them.

Mass testing at the market has found 85 infections so far, including 5 people from Suphan Buri, 3 from Nakhon Pathom, 6 from Phetchaburi, and one from Samut Sakhon, department figures showed. The patients comprised 46 Thai nationals, most of them vendors, and 39 Myanmar citizens working at the market. City Hall's Facebook page said the results of some 3000 tests are pending. "Most of the infections were asymptomatic," Dr Opas said.

The discovery at Bang Khae Market was the latest cluster to put health authorities on alert. Bang Khae Market in Bang Khae district comprises 6 small markets, including one named Wonder, built in the same compound. Wonder Market, the source of the new surge, was ordered to close but other markets in the area are still open.

Bang Khae is the 3rd market to become a COVID-19 hotspot following the outbreaks at Pornpat in Pathum Thani last month [February 2021] and Samut Sakhon in December [2020]. The outbreak at Pornpat market originated in Samut Sakhon but the source of the infections at Bang Khae remains unclear.

The country added 170 new cases on Sunday [14 Mar 2021], more than half of them from Bang Khae Market.

[The crowded and confined settings in small markets pose high risks in the transmission of respiratory infections. Since the daily reported number of COVID-19 has been declining, restrictions are gradually being lifted in places in Thailand.

Nonetheless, risk communication in social distancing and personal protection should still be intensified to avoid further clusters of infection and widespread infection across the country again. - Mod.YMA

Cambodia reported its 1st death from the coronavirus on Thursday [11 Mar 2021] amid its biggest COVID-19 outbreak so far, after a 50-year-old man succumbed to the virus after testing positive less than 2 weeks ago.

With 1124 coronavirus infections recorded in total, Cambodia has among the fewest cases in Asia, although a sharp rise in infections since [20 Feb 2021] has seen its overall tally more than double.

The man died mid-morning local time on Thursday [11 Mar 2021], the health ministry said in a statement.

It said he tested positive on [27 Feb 2021] and was a driver for a Chinese national who lived in the coastal town of Sihanoukville, who was also infected.

The nation of about 16 million people is located next to Laos, Thailand, and Viet Nam, which have all been successful in keeping coronavirus outbreaks under control.

Cambodia started its COVID-19 vaccination programme last month [February 2021].

As of [9 Mar 2021], more than 188 000 people in Cambodia had been vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccines donated by China and with AstraZeneca's Covishield vaccines provided through the COVAX initiative. A total of 3280 people came to get their 2nd shot of Sinopharm, while the number of people receiving a 2nd Covishield dose has not been reported as yet.

"If we add up the number of people who have come to get their vaccination, then the total figure is 103 553 with another 14 047 who weren't eligible for vaccination due to a pre-existing health condition," the health ministry said.

The defence ministry said 98 520 of its personnel had received their 1st doses of Sinopharm in the same period while 30 366 had already received their 2nd shots.

Health minister Mam Bunheng announced on [6 Mar 2021] that Covishield would be provided to government officials and those aged 60 or older from [10 Mar 2021].

The roll out will begin with Phnom Penh and the provinces of Kandal and Preah Sihanouk, which are the current COVID-19 hotspots.

There are 13 capacities of the IHR [International Health Regulations;https://score.tools.who.int/fileadmin/uploads/score/Thumbnails/C-thumbs/SPAR_Guidance_document.pdf) that are "based on the interpretation of the IHR capacity requirements in Annex 1A and 1B of IHR (2005). For each capacity, a number of indicators are used to measure the country's progress towards fully developed and functional IHR capacities."

The 1st of those 13 capacities is "Legislation and Financing: States Parties should have an adequate legal framework in all relevant sectors to support and facilitate the effective and efficient implementation of all of their obligations and rights under the IHR. In some States Parties, IHR implementation may require new or modified legislation. Even where new or revised legislation may not be specifically required under a State Party's legal system, States Parties may still choose to revise some legislation, regulations or other instruments to facilitate their implementation and maintenance in a more efficient, effective, or beneficial manner.

"Legislation could serve to institutionalize and strengthen the role of IHR within the State Party. It can also facilitate coordination among the different entities involved in their implementation. The IHR should serve to institutionalize through legislative frameworks, essential public health functions to sustain the continuous preparedness process for responding to public health events.

"States Parties should ensure provision of adequate funding for the implementation of IHR capacities through the national budgetary process."

The Ministry of Health is expected to announce a high number of COVID-19 positive cases tomorrow morning [16 Mar 2021], most of them from the [20 Feb 2021] Community Event. Khmer Times learned that up to 9pm, Cambodia had recorded close to 60 COVID-19 new positive cases, bringing the tally from the now infamous [20 Feb 2021] Community Event close to 900 - or even exceeding that number.

In addition, the national tally may inch closer towards 1400 cases since the cases were first announced on [20 Feb 2021]. Most of the cases are believed to be in Kandal. These are expected to cross 40 tonight. The total for Kandal may inch closer towards 150 cases by tomorrow.

There was some optimism today [15 Mar 2021] when a low number of just 20 were announced this morning compared to the more than 50 announced daily for several days last week.
