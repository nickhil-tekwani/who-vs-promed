Amid a heat wave that could make West Nile virus more likely to spread, the number of people infected with the disease in Los Angeles [LA] county [California] continued to climb this week.

At least 230 people in LA county have fallen sick with West Nile this year [2017], and 17 of them have died, health officials said [Fri 27 Oct 2017]. The number of people infected is already the 3rd-highest ever in the county, according to health officials -- and the season has yet to end.

"We typically see cases until the end of November," said Dr Aiman Halai, head of the vector-borne disease unit at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. "West Nile virus is a risk in all areas of the county."

Though most people who get West Nile don't have any symptoms, one out of every 150 people infected develops serious problems that can include meningitis (swelling of the brain), vision loss, coma, and weeks-long or even permanent paralysis.

People 50 and older or whose immune systems are compromised are most likely to suffer from these severe consequences, but every year a few younger people also experience them, experts say.

Across California, more than 430 people have fallen sick with West Nile virus, and 24 have died this year [2017].

Dr Benjamin Schwartz, deputy director of the LA county public health department's acute communicable disease program, said cities that have already had cases are likely to have additional cases in the following month. In LA county, Glendale, Los Angeles, and Burbank have had the most cases so far, along with neighborhoods across the San Gabriel Valley and the San Fernando Valley.

"If you live in one of those cities, it's a warning," Schwartz said.

The hotter the weather, the faster the West Nile virus replicates within mosquitoes, making it more likely to be passed on to humans, said Levy Sun, spokesman for the Greater Los Angeles Vector Control District.

Sun said mosquitoes sometimes can't survive very hot and dry weather such as Southern California experienced this week, but when vector control workers recently checked traps to see whether mosquitoes were indeed affected, that did not seem to be the case.

"Unfortunately we're not seeing the die-off we're hoping for," he said. He said mosquitoes might have stayed cool by hiding in backyards, vegetation, or storm drains.

Until it gets too cold for the mosquitoes, West Nile season won't end, he said. "Once we hit our 1st couple cold snaps in the winter, that's when we'll start seeing a lot less activity," he said. "I'm crossing my fingers that'll happen really soon."

[As noted above, with 230 cases including 17 deaths, this is the 3rd highest number of cases of West Nile virus infection in Los Angeles county, with continued risk of infection because the transmission season is ongoing. Interestingly, a 29 Sep 2017 report indicated that WNV transmission was active in Los Angeles country because sentinel chickens had become infected (see West Nile virus - Americas (13): USA (CA) 20170930.5351220). That report indicated that local public health officials launched an all-out effort to involve the public in control efforts and risk reduction. Teams of vector control agents were being sent door to door to tell residents to wear mosquito repellant, install window screens, and dump the stagnant water where the insects breed. They have been plastering the county with posters that read "It's Not Just a Bite" and "No Es Solo Un Piquete." They even created a rap video featuring a fetid swimming pool, a giant dancing mosquito, and teams of uniformed agents rapping, "You've got to dump the water out, drain the water flow, tip the water out, toss the water slow." Given the large number of cases in recent days, these efforts are urgent.
