USA: Chickenpox outbreak in schools in Yadkin County, North Carolina
-----------------------------------------------
Parents and school officials are on alert as dozens of children in 3
Yadkin County elementary schools are being treated for chickenpox
(varicella), and one 8-year-old has died while recovering from a mild
case of the disease. At Jonesville Elementary school, almost 60 of
the school's 480 students have been diagnosed with or displayed
symptoms of chickenpox over the past month. The exact cause of the
child's death has not been determined, but local health officials say
they doubt chickenpox is to blame. The classic symptoms of this
highly contagious disease are blisters that break out and scab over
after a few days. Oftentimes, the blisters are preceded by a headache
and fever.
According to the school's principal, the outbreak isn't limited just
to students who haven't been vaccinated. "We have had both kids who
have had vaccination and those that haven't to have the chickenpox,"
said principal Rick Swaim.
Across the state, the current class of kindergartners was the 1st
required by law to be vaccinated for chickenpox. In September [2006],
the state issued a recommendation urging parents to get a 2nd booster
shot. Because the disease appears to be so widespread -- affecting
not just Jonesville, but also West Yadkin and Booneville elementary
schools -- the Yadkin County Health Department has sent out a letter
to notify parents and doctors.
All over North Carolina, parents are being urged to make sure their
children have both the vaccine and the booster. Health officials say
that since state law doesn't require chickenpox cases to be recorded,
they don't know whether 60 cases in one county in one month is odd.

[According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
website, chickenpox-related deaths happened in about 100 people a
year before 1995, prior to introduction of an improved vaccine. The
CDC states that about 40 percent of deaths due to chickenpox happen
in children younger than age 10.
Research results indicate the current vaccine is about 85 percent
effective in preventing an outbreak. Unfortunately, the absence of a
requirement in North Carolina to record chickenpox cases makes
interpretation of this extensive outbreak affecting 3 elementary
schools in Yadkin County difficult to interpret. Possible reasons are
inadequate vaccine coverage, delay in implementation of universal
vaccination, requirement for more than a single immunization to
achieve sufficient protection.
