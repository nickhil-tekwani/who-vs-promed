Brunswick police on Tuesday [3 Jul 2018] said there appears to be a "widespread rabies epidemic" in the city after a 4th confirmed case of the disease. Police were notified this week that a 4th wild animal has tested positive for rabies in the past 3 weeks. A rabid animal -- a fox -- attacked a man who was gardening on Bouchard Drive on 29 Jun 2018. The man was able to subdue the fox with a shovel without being exposed, according to police.

On 13 Jun 2018, a woman on High Street let her dog outside, where it got into a fight with a skunk that later tested positive for rabies. The woman tried to keep the skunk at bay by spraying it with a hose, police said.

Later that week, a rabid fox attacked a Brunswick woman who was retrieving her mail and then bit a neighbor who tried to help her. Both residents were treated at Mid Coast Hospital, and the fox was shot by a police officer. The 72-year-old woman later said the fox "looked vicious" and knocked her off her feet and bit her on her legs and arm.

On 25 Jun 2018, a 95-year-old man was repairing the deck on his home on Breckan Road when a fox approached him. Robert Galen used a broken plank to fend off the fox, which later tested positive for rabies. "I'd been aware of the rabies incidents in Brunswick, so I almost instinctively hit this animal on the head with the club I had, fortunately, in my hand," Galen said after his encounter with the fox.

Animals have tested positive for rabies in the downtown, Meadowbrook, Pleasant Street and River Road areas, police said.

"It is imperative that all animals that can be vaccinated are current on their rabies shots," Commander Mark Waltz said in a statement. "Residents and visitors should also be extra vigilant when they encounter wildlife."

Rabies is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord and is usually spread through a bite or scratch from a wild animal that has the virus. If left untreated, it can be fatal.

Buncombe County Health and Human Service officials said a deer found off of Newfound Road in Leicester has been confirmed to have rabies. According to health officials, the deer was taken to Buncombe County Animal Control on 5 Jul 2018, and the animal tested positive for rabies at the North Carolina State Lab.

"Rabies is a serious disease that can be deadly without immediate treatment. Any person who thinks they may have come into contact with this deer should contact BCHHS Communicable Disease at (828) 250-5109," Jessica Silver, BCHHS Environmental Health Director, said.

To report wildlife showing signs of rabies [in North Carolina], call the NC Wildlife Helpline at 886-318-2401.

The following are things health officials are asking area residents to do:
- Contact your doctor as soon as possible if you believe you or your child came in contact with the deer.
- Contact your veterinarian as soon as possible if you believe your pet came in contact with the deer. Be sure that pets are up-to-date on their rabies vaccinations per North Carolina law.
- Avoid wild or unfamiliar animals: keep children and pets away from wild or unfamiliar animals, keep your pet on a leash when out for a walk, and do not rescue or touch wild or unfamiliar animals.
- If your pet comes in contact with a wild or unfamiliar animal, avoid contact with both animals.
- Contact Animal Control if you see an animal acting strangely or if you, someone else, or your pet comes in contact with a wild or unfamiliar animal.

- If you have been bitten by any animal:
1. Clean your wound thoroughly for at least 10 minutes with soap and water.
2. Immediately contact the appropriate jurisdiction's Animal Control if you or your pet is bitten to assist in capturing the animal for observation and/or rabies testing.
3. See a medical provider for wound evaluation and possible treatment.

- "Post-exposure vaccines" can prevent rabies disease in humans if started as soon as possible after the exposure and before the development of symptoms. If a person bitten by an animal with rabies does not get the recommended rabies post-exposure treatment, survival is rare.
- Any medical provider who cares for someone who has been bitten by an animal must report the animal bite within 24 hours. If the animal is caught and tested and does not have rabies, exposed persons will not need post-exposure vaccines.

[For information on wildlife reservoirs of rabies in the USA, see: http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/animals/wildlife_reservoirs.html.

Despite its ability to infect all mammals, rabies virus persists in numerous species-specific cycles that rarely sustain transmission in alternative species. Historically in North America, skunk rabies occurs mainly in 4 geographical regions: (1) southern Ontario and Quebec and upper New York State; (2) the north-central United States and the Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta; (3) California; and (4) south-central United States (Texas and several adjacent states, including northern Louisiana). The variant of terrestrial rabies present along the east coast is maintained by raccoons. Fox rabies has been essentially eradicated in Ontario, Canada but it persists in the adjoining northeast American states.

Rabies in deer is unusual and reflects contact with another wildlife species, in this case probably a rabid raccoon. - Mod.MHJ
