Outbreak alert: cluster of unexplained deaths from acute neurological
syndrome in Bangladesh
------------------------------------------
[On Sat 12 May 2001 ProMED-mail posted a press report [that described an
outbreak of suspected Japanese encephalitis (JE) in the remote village of
Chandpur in Bangladesh. The following additional information [has now
[come from the World Health Organization [WHO. The provisional diagnosis
of JE has not been confirmed and the current outbreak is being linked to a
previous unexplained outbreak in Siliguri (India, North Bengal)
inconclusively attributed to an atypical strain of measles virus. - Mod.CP
Twenty-eight cases, 9 fatal, of acute neurological syndrome (progressive
fever, malaise, headache, coma, and death) have been reported in Chandpur
of Sadar thana, Meherpur District, Bangladesh. This is the smallest and
least populated district in Bangladesh. The cases are adults, most of them
men. The first case became ill on 26 Apr 2001 and the most recent case
(conflicting reports) on 9 to 12 May 2001.
The clinical diagnosis is viral encephalitis, but lumbar puncture and other
investigations were not done and necropsies were not performed. JE
diagnosis kits arrived in Bangladesh on Sun 20 May 2001. About 45 blood
samples were collected from survivors and contacts and will be sent to
AFRIMS in Bangkok.
A team headed by the Director of Communicable Disease Control, DGHS, MOH
has returned to Dhaka. One entomology team and one laboratory team left
Dhaka on 14 May (present status unknown).
Pigs live in proximity to the villagers and JE was initially suspected, but
JE has not been previously recognized as a problem in this area in
Bangladesh and the sex, age, and case fatality rate are not consistent with
JE. The epidemiological and clinical data provided to date suggests that
the outbreak may be the same disease that appeared in Siliguri, India,
earlier this year. The occurrence of this fast-acting, highly fatal disease
with unexplained etiology that has now emerged across the border in
Bangladesh is therefore of great concern. The Ministry of Health believes
that surveillance in the area is good and is confident that there have not
been more cases. Aggressively targeted case finding in the town and
surrounding areas should be conducted to assure that more cases are not
occurring. WHO has offered assistance to the Ministry of Health of
Bangladesh to investigate this outbreak.

Bangladesh; Dr Kanak Ranjan Talukder, director, Communicable Disease
Control, Ministry of Health, Bangladesh.
