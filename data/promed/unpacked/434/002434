We would like to inform you that since 10 Sep 2014, our diagnostic laboratory at the Animal Health Trust (AHT) in Newmarket, United Kingdom has confirmed multiple positive cases of equine influenza in the UK. Areas affected include Cornwall, Essex, Somerset, and Sussex in England, as well as East Lothian and Perthshire in Scotland.

The diagnoses were made following positive qRT-PCR [quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR] assays performed on nasopharyngeal swabs sample taken from animals presenting with clinical signs including nasal discharge, coughing and lethargy. Some of the affected animals were recently imported from Ireland.

Virus isolation and characterisation is currently underway at the AHT, details will be made available at http://www.equiflunet.org.uk as soon as possible.
