North Georgia: Outbreak of Viral Meningitis
-------------------------------------------
A viral meningitis outbreak has Georgia on track to double the number of
cases in a typical year. Viral meningitis is much milder and less deadly
than bacterial meningitis. The viral version usually causes a short-lived
flu-like sickness, but officials are concerned about it in 2003 because 300
cases were reported between January and July, whereas in a typical year,
175 cases are recorded in Georgia.
Richard Quartarone of Georgia's Public Health Division says the outbreak
apparently started in Augusta but has spread to Gainesville and metro
Atlanta. The health division put out a call to the media on Monday asking
for help in encouragement of hand-washing. Quartarone also cautioned people
against sharing utensils or lip balm, especially during July and August,
when viruses carried in the digestive system are typically at their peaks.
State health workers are visiting day-care centers and schools to promote
hand washing, which is considered the best prevention tool.
Symptoms of viral meningitis include headache, fever, sore neck, and
nausea. There's no cure, but sufferers are encouraged to see a doctor to
make sure they don't have bacterial meningitis, which can cause death by
damaging the lining around the brain and spinal cord.

[Non-bacterial ("aseptic") meningitis is a frequent accompaniment of
enteroviral infection. Many different enteroviruses have been associated
with aseptic meningitis. Recovery is normally complete within a few weeks,
but irritability and fatigue may persist. There is a low risk of serious
neurological damage only during the first year of life. - Mod.CP]
