The Food and Drug Administration [FDA has begun a major revision of its
guidelines for approving new antibiotics for animals and for monitoring the
effects of old ones because they are faced with mounting evidence that the
routine use of antibiotics in livestock may diminish the drugs' power to
cure infections in people.
The goal of the revision is to minimize the emergence of bacterial strains
that are resistant to antibiotics. Such resistance makes them difficult or
even impossible to kill. Drug-resistant infections, some fatal, have been
increasing in people in the United States, and some scientists attribute
the problem to the misuse of antibiotics in both humans and animals. Of
concern to scientists is recent studies found bacteria in chickens that are
resistant to fluoroquinolones, the most recently approved class of
antibiotics and one that scientists had been hoping would remain effective
for a long time.
A crucial component of the new guidelines will be the requirement that
manufacturers test certain new livestock drugs for a tendency to foster the
growth of resistant bacteria that could prove harmful to people. Testing
will be required for a drug both before and after its approval. The
antibiotics that would get special scrutiny are those that are also used by
humans or are related to drugs used by humans. If the antibiotics are shown
to foster bacterial resistance, they could be banned from use as growth
promoters in animals. If scientists became aware of a problem with older
antibiotics, they could also be banned.
The proposed guidelines have drawn criticism from both sides of a bitter
debate, ongoing for three decades. At issue is the extensive use of
antibiotics in livestock: of the 50 million pounds of antibiotics produced
every year in the United States, about 40 percent is given to animals,
mostly as feed additives to promote growth.
On one side, the drug and agriculture industries were cited as saying that
the FDA is going too far toward restricting access to antibiotics, which
they insist are essential to produce safe and affordable meat and poultry.
The industries were cited as saying the proposed rules will make drug
development, already difficult and expensive, even more so.
At a meeting held by the FDA in late January to discuss the proposed
changes, Dr. Brendan Fox, president of Elanco Animal Health, a division of
the pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly and Co., said "We believe the agency is
greatly overstating the conclusiveness and the implications of the data and
has put forth a seriously flawed proposal."
On the other side, public-health and consumer advocates were cited as
saying that the FDA is not going far enough, because antibiotics are a
precious medical resource that should not be squandered to fatten animals.
On Tuesday, a coalition of 37 groups, led by the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, a nonprofit group based in Washington, will petition the
FDA to separately rule if a drug is used to treat diseases in people, it
can no longer be given to animals as a growth promoter.
The agency's [FDA working proposal, or "framework," open for public
comment until April 6, will not be translated into new regulations for
about two years. Dr. Stephen F. Sundlof, director of the center for
veterinary medicine at the FDA, said the agency was acting now because the
nation is in a vulnerable period, with no new classes of antibiotics
expected to come onto the market for several years. That makes it all the
more important to preserve the potency of existing drugs.
The reason there are no new types of antibiotics in the pipeline is during
the 1980s there seemed to be more than enough, and drug companies stopped
making new ones, Sundlof said. They have since resumed working on new
antibiotics, but it can take 10 years to bring a new drug to market.
The last new class of antibiotics approved, fluoroquinolones, came into use
in 1986. One of the common brand names is Ciprofloxacin, a treatment for
some infections like gastrointestinal illness caused by salmonella
bacteria. Sundlof said the agency was especially concerned about averting
the development of widespread resistance to this class of antibiotics.
Sundlof was quoted as saying, "Resistance has always been a problem in
human medicine. The way we had avoided any catastrophic events was to
continue to develop new products. But it became apparent in the 1990s that
there weren't any new classes at the stage of development where they'd be
approved and available in the near future, and there was great concern that
if resistance developed to this last class of drugs, it could have very bad
ramifications for the public."
In the United States, 6 of the 17 classes of antibiotics given to animals
for growth promotion are also used to treat sick people. Sundlof was cited
as saying that it was beyond the authority of the FDA to pass a blanket ban
like the one advocacy groups wanted.
At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, researchers said they
had been detecting increases in the levels of drug-resistant bacteria found
in people with gastrointestinal illness from the microbes _Salmonella_ and
_Campylobacter_, which are most commonly contracted from contaminated meat
or eggs.
Last May, a team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC
reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that the prevalence of a
_Salmonella_ strain resistant to five different antibiotics increased from
0.6 percent of all specimens from around country tested by the centers in
1980 to 34 percent in 1996.
Dr. Fred Angulo, a medical epidemiologist in the foodborne and diarrheal
disease branch at the CDC, said that similarly, drug resistance in
_Campylobacter_ bacteria rose from zero in 1991 to 13 percent in 1997 and
14 percent in 1998. He said epidemiologists were "alarmed" by the
_Campylobacter_ figures, because the resistance is to fluoroquinolones, the
very class of drug that the FDA is trying hardest to preserve.
Angulo said he and his colleagues blamed much of the increase in
fluoroquinolone resistance on the FDA's approval of the drugs to treat a
respiratory infection in chickens in 1995. It was an approval the CDC
opposed, because it would lead to extensive use of the drugs on chickens.
A recent study, scheduled to appear in the New England Journal of Medicine,
was cited as offering strong evidence that people pick up drug-resistant
bacteria from chickens. In that study, researchers at the state Health
Department in Minnesota found that fluoroquinolone resistant
_Campylobacter_ had increased from 1.3 percent of cases in 1992 to 10.2
percent in 1998. The sharpest rise began in 1996, a year after
fluoroquinolones were approved for chickens.
Dr. Michael Osterholm, the former state epidemiologist in Minnesota, said
the health department also found _Campylobacter_ in 88 percent of the
chickens they bought in supermarkets in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Twenty
percent of the chickens had a resistant strain.
Osterholm said healthy people recover from _Campylobacter_, often without
even being treated. But in patients whose immunity has been lowered by
illness, AIDS or treatment for cancer, the infection could be deadly. The
proportion of society in that vulnerable category is increasing, because of
the aging population. "One of the things we're beginning to understand is
that we'll see a major change in the implications of foodborne disease in
our population. As we get a little older, it has a much more serious
implication."
Given the widespread availability of antibiotics on farms and the long
entrenched habit of using them, Angulo said regulation alone probably would
not bring about the changes that are needed, adding, "People would have to
accept that there is a problem. Many don't. It's a societal change, and we
have the same problems in human medicine." Many people, he added, demand
antibiotics for viral infections and other problems that the drugs cannot
help.
Angulo was quoted "The way we will make major progress, unfortunately, is
when there is continuing emergence of treatment problems, not just in
humans, but when these drugs don't work in sick animals. As that increases,
the realization might come."
