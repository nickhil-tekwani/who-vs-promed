[Juba is located in the southern part of Sudan and is the capital of the
autonomous region since the 2005 peace agreement between North and South
Sudan. I assume Central Equatoria and Bahr Al Jebel referred to in a
previous posting are the same location; see below.
Juba is located on the White Nile about 150 km north of Uganda and is the
key gateway to the southern region of Sudan. Of course, there are concerns
that avian influenza is found in poultry this far south while still being
present in Khartoum. As always, effective comprehensive surveillance to
identify infected flocks and areas is the key. - Mod.PC]
