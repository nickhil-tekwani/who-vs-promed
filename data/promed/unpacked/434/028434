Bird flu infects 2 Vietnamese women have bird flu - report
---------------------
Two Vietnamese women have tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu
virus, but one has recovered while the other is in intensive care, a
state-run newspaper reported on Tuesday [12 Jun 2007].
The online newspaper Vietnamnet () quoted the director of
the Vietnam Administration of Preventive Medicine Nguyen Huy Nga as
confirming the 2 women, aged 28 and 29, from the northern provinces
of Thanh Hoa and Ha Nam, had bird flu. Nga said both had been
admitted to a hospital in Hanoi.
The 29-year-old woman from Thanh Hoa, who was infected after eating
dead duck, had recovered, while other woman was using a respirator to
breathe, Nga said. Both Thanh Hoa and Ha Nam are among a list of 15
provinces and a city that have reported bird flu outbreaks in poultry
since early May [2007].
The 2 new human cases came only a day after doctors said a man who
was Vietnam's 1st human bird flu case in a year and a half has won
the battle against the virus, leaving hospital on Monday [11 Jun
2007].
Doctors were still treating a 2nd patient, a slaughterhouse worker
from outside Hanoi who became sick late last month [May 2007, see
references below]. The patient was recovering well, they said.
Bird flu has killed 42 people out of 95 cases of infection in Vietnam
since it emerged in late 2003. Meanwhile, the Animal Health
Department said 3 bird flu cases in poultry were found on [7 Jun
2007] and [8 Jun 2007] in the northern province of Thai Binh, which
had reported outbreaks in other districts in the province.

Vietnam has 2 more bird flu patients
-------------------
Vietnam's Health Ministry has reported 2 additional human cases of
bird flu infections, raising the total number in the country since
November 2005 to 4. The 2 latest cases include a 29-year-old man from
northern Thanh Hoa province, and a 20-year-old woman from northern Ha
Nam province, according to the country's Preventive Medicine
Department on Tuesday [12 Jun 2007].
Specimens from the man, who was discharged from hospital on [3 Jun
2007] after showing such bird flu symptoms as fever, coughing and
pneumonia, have recently been tested positive to bird flu virus
strain H5N1. He ate a sick white-winged duck before falling ill, the
department said.
The woman, suffering from severe pneumonia, is under treatment at the
Tropical Disease Hospital in Hanoi capital. Local doctors are probing
into why she has contracted H5N1.
Vietnam's 1st bird flu patient since November 2005, a 30-year-old man
from northern Vinh Phuc province, was discharged from hospital on [11
Jun 2007] after 26 days of treatment. He exhibited bird flu symptoms
on [10 May 2007] after having slaughtered chickens for a wedding
party.
Now, 2 local people are under treatment at the Tropical Disease
Hospital: the woman from Ha Nam and a local man from northern Thai
Nguyen province. The man, Vietnam's 2nd bird flu patient since
November 2005, worked at a poultry slaughterhouse in Hanoi on [14 May
2007] and developed bird flu symptoms 5 days later.
To date, Vietnam has reported a total of 97 human cases of bird flu
infections, including 42 fatalities. However, the World Health
Organization has yet to confirm the 4 latest cases of infections in
the country's northern region.
Vietnam's Health Ministry has asked preventive medicine centers,
Pasteur institutes and hygiene and epidemiology institutes nationwide
to establish hotlines to receive bird flu information from the
community. The ministry is also coordinating with the World Health
Organization to probe into the possibility of H5N1 mutation.
Since early May [2007], bird flu has hit poultry in 16 Vietnamese
cities and provinces nationwide, namely Nghe An, Nam Dinh, Son La,Hai
Phong, Quang Ninh, Bac Giang, Dong Thap, Can Tho, Ninh Binh, Bac
Ninh, Vinh Phuc, Ha Nam, Quang Nam, Hung Yen, Thai Binh and Phu Tho,
according to the country's Department of Animal Health.

[The above newswires seem to have inconsistencies in epidemiologic
data that require clarification. In the 1st newswire there is mention
of 2 new cases -- a 29-year-old woman from Thanh Hoa Province and a
28-year-old woman from Ha Nam Province. In the 2nd newswire, there is
mention of a total of 4 cases -- the 2 prior cases, a 29-year-old man
from northern Thanh Hoa Province and a 20-year-old woman from Ha Nam
Province. In either event, both cases come from provinces where avian
influenza outbreaks among poultry have been reported, and one of the
cases has already been documented to have had contact with a sick
avian. Clarification of these discrepancies would be appreciated.
