A _Clostridium difficile_ outbreak in a Quebec City hospital has
claimed 8 lives. A total of 52 patients have been infected by the
bacterium in the last 3 months, officials at St. Francois d'Assise
hospital said on Wed 13 Jun 2007. Most of these patients are seniors
averaging 83 years old who suffered various ailments before
contracting _C. difficile_.
An investigation into the outbreak has begun, and a final report will
be completed in June 2007, officials said. The hospital did report an
improvement in the number of new cases of _C. difficile_ in the last
3 weeks, when only 3 patients were diagnosed, and none proved fatal.
This is the 1st time a Quebec City hospital has been hit with this
many _C. difficile_ cases.
Earlier in 2007, the Honore Mercier hospital in Ste. Hyacinthe was
struck with 2 outbreaks of the disease, causing 16 deaths.

[It is not stated whether the outbreak was due to the ribotype 027
strain, which is the more virulent strain that has caused more severe
disease in North America and Europe (as discussed in the "see also"
section below). The strain has an 18-bp deletion in the _tcdC_
reading frame, which is felt to be a negative regulator of the
production of toxins A and B and may be responsible for the
recognized enhanced toxin production of the strain.
_C. difficile_ control in the health care setting involves not only
aggressive infection control measures but also prudent control of the
overuse of antimicrobial agents. The disease has also been called
"antibiotic-associated colitis" and "pseudomembranous enterocolitis."
