Several Oklahoma families have been hospitalized with _E. coli_ illnesses after attending the same event at the State Fairgrounds [in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma County]. While some cases are minor, some are more severe, putting one 8-year-old in ICU. [The boy] is on dialysis, has received several blood transfusions and is breathing with the help of a ventilator.

His mother had a minor case that put her in the hospital for just a few days. But they aren't the only ones.

A cousin says the boy is surrounded by several families at the hospital with the same illness, who all attended the same youth expo. "We just kind of want some answers to know where it came from," she said. "That way it can be stopped."

The state health department's Lauri Smithee says the possibilities are endless. "At this time we are not able to definitively say we have a contaminated this or that, or stall or barn or food vendor," says Smithee. "These particular organisms are really only found in the intestinal tract of ruminant animals, which are cows, sheep, goats and perhaps deer."

It could also be found in contaminated foods. So they're investigating everything from the livestock to the food trucks.

The health department urges anyone who has attended events on the State Fairgrounds since the Oklahoma Youth Expo to not ignore any flu-like symptoms, like vomiting and diarrhea without a fever.

[With renal failure as a complication of EHEC associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome, the pathogen in this outbreak is certainly an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, either serotype O157:H7 or another. It appears that livestock were present at this expo but may not be the source of the EHEC. It is unclear from what geographic range the individuals attending this expo came from.

Along these lines of foodborne EHEC, it is noteworthy that a newly published paper published by investigators at Purdue University (Hong Y, Pan Y, Ebner PD: Development of bacteriophage treatments to reduce _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 contamination of beef products and produce. J Anim Sci. 2014;92: 1366-1377) has addressed the potential use of bacteriophages in decreasing food contamination with EHEC. The abstract is reproduced below:

"_Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 remains a foodborne pathogen of concern with infections associated with products ranging from ground beef to produce to processed foods. We previously demonstrated that phage-based technologies could reduce foodborne pathogen colonization in live animals. Here, we examined if a 3-phage cocktail could reduce _E. coli_ O157:H7 in experimentally contaminated ground beef, spinach, and cheese. The 3 phages were chosen from our _E. coli_ O157:H7 phage library based on their distinct origins of isolation, lytic ranges, and rapid growth (40- to 50-min life cycle). 2 phages belonged to the Myoviridae family and the other phage belonged to the Siphoviridae family. The phage cocktail was added to ground beef, spinach leaves, and cheese slices contaminated with _E. coli_ O157:H7 (10(7) cfu) at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Phage treatment reduced (P less than 0.05) the concentrations of _E. coli_ O157:H7 by 1.97 log10 cfu/mL in ground beef when stored at room temperature (24 degrees C) for 24 h, 0.48 log10 cfu/mL at refrigeration (4 degrees C), and 0.56 log10 cfu/mL in undercooked condition (internal temperature of 46 degrees C). Likewise, phage treatment reduced (P less than 0.05) _E. coli_ O157:H7 by 3.28, 2.88, and 2.77 log10 cfu/mL in spinach when stored at room temperature for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Phage treatment, however, did not reduce _E. coli_ O157:H7 concentrations in contaminated cheese. Additionally, 3 phage-resistant _E. coli_ O157:H7 strains (309-PR [phage resistant] 1, 309-PR4, and 502-PR5) were isolated and characterized to test if phage resistance could limit long-term use of phages as biocontrol agents. Growth kinetics and adsorption assays indicated that phage resistance in strains 309-PR4 and 502-PR5 was mediated, at least in part, by prevention of phage adsorption. Phage resistance in strain 309-PR1 was the result of limited phage proliferation. Phage resistance was stably maintained in vitro throughout a 4-d subculture period in the absence of phage. No significant reductions in bacterial growth or cell adhesion were observed in resistant strains. Taken together, our results provide additional support for the use of phage to control _E. coli_ O157:H7 in food products; however, the emergence of phage-resistant bacteria could limit the efficacy of phage products. Therefore, further studies are needed to develop resistance mitigation strategies to optimize phage-based technologies." - Mod.LL
