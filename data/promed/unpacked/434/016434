The International Potato Center (CIP) draws attention to the considerable spread of potato brown rot (_Ralstonia solanacearum_; Rs) in African countries. According to a survey in 10 countries of subsaharan Africa in 2018 [see also ProMED post 20200413.7220961], it is the most serious threat to the region's potato crops. CIP studies of its prevalence in several African countries confirmed its considerable spread.

Whereas potato farmers commonly control fungal diseases by spraying fungicides, there is no comparable agrochemical option for brown rot management. It poses an acute threat to potato production because it is spread by infected seed tubers. Brown rot is responsible for an estimated USD 1 billion of economic losses globally each year, and Rs has been declared a high-risk quarantine organism in Europe and the Mediterranean region.

Infected tubers are likely being disseminated in the region with informal potato trade among countries. In the absence of potato seed tuber certification and regional quarantine measures, brown rot will become an increasingly serious problem and threaten the region's rapidly expanding potato industry. CIP is promoting the use of molecular diagnostic technology (loop-mediated isothermal amplification; LAMP) to ensure pathogen-free planting stock. Educating farmers and decision makers about the threat severity and available management options is also considered vital.

[Brown rot (also called bacterial wilt, slime rot) of potato is caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 3 (biovar 2, adapted to cooler temperatures) or race 1 (prevalent in warmer areas). Yield losses are mostly caused by tuber rotting, before or after harvest. The pathogen also causes bacterial wilt of tomato, a major disease of the crop, and it can also affect other solanaceous crops.

The bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including insect activities), contaminated equipment, infected plant material (including seed potatoes), soil and water. They can survive in soil on plant debris or roots of hosts. Some solanaceous weeds and unharvested potato plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management is difficult, relying mostly on exclusion from new areas. Some cultural methods (such as crop rotation), control of pathogen reservoirs and phytosanitary measures (soil fumigation) may be used. Biological control is being investigated. Potato cultivars with levels of genetic resistance are available for certain growing conditions.

A survey in Uganda (ProMED post 20200413.7220961 & link below) reports that the strains identified there belonged to 3 phylotypes. Members of one of these were identified as playing an important epidemiological role, being disseminated via latently infected seed tubers.

Members of the Rs species complex affect more than 200 plant species, including many important crops. The various races and biovars are active under different climatic conditions and in different hosts.
