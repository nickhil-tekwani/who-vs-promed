Bird flu re-emerged after declaration of bird flu free country
--------------------------------------------------------------
A few months after the government declared Nepal as the bird flu free
country, cases of bird flu [avian influenza] have been confirmed in
the valley.

More than 500 chickens have been culled near Jadibuti area of
Bhaktapur after the bird flu cases were confirmed, chief of the
District Livestock Service Office Bhaktapur Shiva Bahadur KC informed
Nepalnews. Local people had informed livestock office after the
numbers of chickens and the ducks died continuously.

Bird flu detection is declared only after the Central Veterinary
Disease Control Laboratory gets confirmation from international lab,
due to the lack of a lab facility in the country. The laboratory sends
sample to the UK for the final confirmation after conducting
preliminary lab test here.

On 13 Jul 2011, the government had declared Nepal as a bird flu free
country though the cases were confirmed earlier too. The poultry
industry of the country was hit hard due to the outbreak of the bird
flu last year [2010].
