A local government in Japan confirmed Monday that the 3rd case of bird flu
outbreak within the month involved the highly virulent H5 strain of avian
influenza, Kyodo News said.
Dozens of chickens died of H5 infection in a poultry farm in the city of
Takahashi, Okayama prefecture, during the past days, the prefectural
government said on Monday [29 Jan 2007] morning.
Earlier in January 2007, 2 bird flu cases involving the deadly H5N1 strain
were reported in southern Japan's Miyazaki prefecture, where thousands of
birds died in 2 chicken farms, and the remaining tens of thousands were
culled later.
Bird flu infections hit dozens of farms in central Japan's Ibaraki
prefecture in 2005 and 2006, resulting in the killing of at least 5.8
million poultry.
