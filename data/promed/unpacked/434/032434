1st Report of Cherry green ring mottle virus on Sweet Cherry in Poland.

Cherry green ring mottle virus (CGRMV), a member of the genus _Foveavirus_,
infects several _Prunus_ species including sweet cherry, sour cherry,
ornamental cherry, peach, and apricot throughout North America and Europe.
On sour cherry, the virus causes leaf yellowing and dark mottle around
secondary veins. Sweet cherry trees are symptomless hosts of CGRMV.
During the 2004 growing season, 27 sour and sweet cherry trees were tested
for the presence of CGRMV. RNA was isolated from leaves using an RNeasy kit
(Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and then evaluated by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification. 2 primer
sets, GRMV7956/GRMV8316 (1) and NCP5/NCP3 (2), were used for amplification
of the CGRMV coat protein gene (807 bp) or its fragment (366 bp),
respectively. The cDNA fragments were cloned into bacterial vector pCR
2.1-TOPO, sequenced and analyzed using the Lasergene (DNASTAR, Madison, WI)
computer program. Nucleotide sequence of the C328 isolate (GenBank
Accession No. AY841279) was compared with corresponding regions of
published sequences of CGRMV isolates.
The nucleotide sequence of this isolate was 98 percent identical to the Leb
isolate (GenBank Accession No. AF533157) from sour cherry. The lowest
similarity (80 percent) was between the CP sequences of isolate C328 and an
isolate from apricot (GenBank Accession No. AY172334.1).
Results of biological indexing on _Prunus serrulata_ 'Shirofugen' and
'Kwanzan' confirmed the infection of 'Star' sweet cherry with CGRMV. The
indicators showed leaf epinasty and necrosis of fragments of midrib or
veins characteristic for CGRMV (2). The CGRMV infection of the indicators
was confirmed using RT-PCR.

[Usually CGRMV disease remains latent on sweet cherry and peach, sour
cherry and ornamental _Prunus_ species. It develops leaf yellowing and dark
mottles around secondary veins in early June in the United States. Fruits
are often necrotized. On _P. serrulata_ (Japanese cherry) the disease is
very severe with twisting and atrophy of the youngest leaves. In early
summer the bark cracks and the young tips die. About 5 percent of cherry
and peach cultivars are contaminated with latent CGRMV. It seems to be
evenly distributed in the plant and not epidemic. Indexing on _P.
serrulata_ and recently developed PCR tests are used for detection of the
virus.
In Europe, research has established that CGRMV-infected trees in the
Campania region of Italy can also be infected with Apple chlorotic leaf
spot leaf spot virus (ACLSV). At times indicator trees showed irregular
ringspots and a marked clearing of the principal veins.
To evaluate the possible presence of other viral agents, DsRNAs purified
from the infected GF305 indicator trees were used as templates in a
polyvalent PCR detection assay. Besides ACLSV, PCR products corresponding
to 2 additional viral agents could be amplified and sequenced. One of the
agents appeared to be a new _Trichovirus_, while the other appears to be a
_Foveavirus_ closely related to Cherry green ring mottle virus (CGRMV).
A new molecular technique to detect these 2 cherry flexiviruses in _Prunus_
spp has been developed. It is sensitive and reliable, and can detect both
viruses simultaneously. The method is more cost-efficient, takes up less
space, and is completed in 2 days instead of 4 months.
