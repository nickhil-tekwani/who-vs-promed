Subject: "Second Death from CJD" in Crete, Greece.
>From a local newspaper:
> "Second Death from CJD"
> "The second man from Iraklion who had CJD, according to the brain tissue
biopsy, died in the Neurology dept of University Hospital of Iraklion
yesterday morning. The man was 58 years old with symptoms of the CJD,
hospitalized since the first days of last January."
"Another 56 years old man died from CJD two weeks ago. The brains of these
men will examined for the detailed documentation of this rare disease."
"According to the neurology professor Dimitris Plaitakis the two cases will
examined with the current methods." "The research expected to complete in a
two-year period." "It is reminded that the the first brain tissue biopsy
results, point to CJD which however does not related to Mad Cow Disaese."<
- Iraklion is the capital of the island of Crete with an urban population of
150.000 and rural of 100.000.
- Crete is one of the thirteen districts of Greece and is closed a
geographical region with a population of 500.000.
- Greece has a population of 10.000.000.
As far as I know the above two cases are the first reported in the
newspapers in Greece since March 1996.
