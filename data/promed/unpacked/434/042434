Cassava mosaic disease
------------------------
Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is spreading in northwestern Tanzania,
threatening local food security through its impact on cassava
production. Cassava is an important subsistence food crop in
Tanzania, especially in semi-arid areas, as it is drought-tolerant
and significant yields are possible even when grown on marginal
soils. The crop serves as a household security crop, as it is
considered a famine reserve when other food crops fail. Additionally,
cassava is a staple food in many parts: Mara, Mwanza, Kigoma and
drier parts of Kagera, Kigoma, Mtwara, Lindi, Tanga and coastal areas.
Cassava is now threatened by a severe strain of CMD. This virus is
transmitted to cassava plants by whiteflies when they feed on the
plant, and by planting infected cassava cuttings. The disease is
regarded as the most important of those affecting cassava in
sub-Saharan Africa, especially since the onset of the current very
damaging pandemic in eastern and central Africa, which can lead to
total losses of harvests. The current pandemic of CMD was 1st
recorded in Tanzania in 1998, at which time it was 40 km [24.86
miles] from the border with Uganda and was spreading towards Bukoba
town and Karagwe district. In 1999, the disease was reported to be in
Muleba and Karagwe districts, at which point the rate of infection
was realized to be more than 40 km per year, similar to that
previously reported in Uganda. CMD has now spread to all districts in
Kagera, crossed into Mwanza, Shinyanga and Kigoma and is continuing
to spread further south and westwards.
The potential spread of CMD poses a serious threat to food security
throughout Tanzania. In Kigoma, Mara and the coastal areas where
cassava is a staple food, as CMD continues to spread cassava
production will continue to decrease. The impact of CMD on cassava
has been cushioned by good production of other crops following the
good rains this year [2007], but when the rains are not adequate to
support sufficient alternative crops, cassava-dependant households
will face reduced food access. In other areas of the country, the
spread of the disease is not an immediate threat, as cassava is
primarily a substitute crop that is eaten only when other foods are
not available. However, when drought or other shocks reduce
production of staple crops, CMD could take away an important coping
mechanism of most low-income households.
To date, the only way to destroy the virus is by using massive doses
of insecticide to kill whiteflies, which can be prohibitively
expensive for subsistence farmers and can threaten their health and
that of surrounding plants and animals. Efforts to control CMD
include the development and deployment of virus-resistant cassava
varieties. These have provided a powerful incentive for farmers to
abandon some of their most susceptible traditional varieties.
Improved phyto-sanitation measures are also being employed, providing
CMD-free planting material and removing diseased plants. Some cassava
varieties have been abandoned due to their severe susceptibility to
the disease, and as a result varieties are disappearing in the
affected areas. Local government authorities and development
organizations in affected districts are supporting the multiplication
of virus-resistant varieties. However, supplies of planting materials
are not sufficient.

[Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is caused by _African cassava mosaic
virus_ (ACMV), genus _Begomovirus_, family _Geminiviridae_. A number
of different strains have been identified in different areas of
Africa causing disease. Co-infections as well as genetic
recombination between strains have also been reported. Both scenarios
may lead to even more severe disease. Traditional cassava varieties
succumb to CMD and vector control has proven unsatisfactory under the
conditions in developing countries. Thus, the use of resistant
cassava cultivars appears to be the best way to control CMD. Both
traditional breeding and biotechnology approaches are being used to
develop resistant cassava lines. Resistant planting material is being
distributed for re-planting in CMD-affected areas in Africa under
various country programmes.
