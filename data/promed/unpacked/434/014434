The Health Department of the Caala municipality, which is located 23
km from the provincial capital, reported 5 cases of people being
bitten by rabid dogs that were roaming in the main streets of the
city during the month of January [2009].

This fact was given to the Angop [Angola Press] today [3 Feb 2009] by
the head of the Health Division in the municipality of Caala, Ernesto
Albino Ndumbo, and thanks to prompt intervention of hospital
services, they [the people bitten by the rabid dogs] are out of
danger [presumably as a consequence of post-exposure vaccination].

Furthermore, the head of the municipal Health department in Caala
said the municipal health technicians have increased actions to raise
the awareness of residents on preventive measures against rabies. He
stressed that in addition to conducting talks in health centers, the
health technicians have also conducted door to door sensitization
activities to encourage the population to take their animals to the
vaccination centers.

The Angop knows that in the entire township of Caala, since January
2009, the veterinary services have immunized approximately 500
animals with rabies vaccine including dogs, cats and monkeys.

[Unfortunately, such incidents have not been rare in Angola, and the
efforts of the authorities have been reactive rather than preemptive.
In January 2007 (see archive reference below), a similar outbreak
occurred in another township (Ukuma), also close to the provincial
capital, in which 21 people were bitten by dogs, one of whom died.

The location of Caala, a community of approximately 7000 persons in
the province of Huambo, can be found at:
