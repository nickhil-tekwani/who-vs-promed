The patient was a 22-year old research assistant who had been assisting
with an annual survey of a group of rhesus monkeys housed in an outdoor
corral. The process involves running the group (about 100 animals in this
group) into an indoor capture area, from which they are moved into aluminum
transfer boxes and shifted from there into a squeeze cage where they are
anesthetized with ketamine.
Once immobilized, they are weighed, TB tested, examined, tattooed,
dewormed, etc. and returned to another part of the capture area for
recovery. While shifting one of the animals the technician sustained an
exposure to her eye of a small amount of material that was not further
identified. She reportedly cleaned the eye with a towel (but did not
irrigate it), and didn't perceive it to be, or report it as, an exposure.
Consequently, no notice was taken of which animal was involved and most of
the people working with her were unaware of the incident at the time it
occurred or for several days thereafter.
We routinely discuss B-virus in our orientation for personnel, require use
of gloves, masks, head covers, footwear and outer clothing that is not worn
home for working with monkeys, but face shields have only been required
when hosing cages or otherwise producing aerosols. We have good compliance
with immediate scrubbing and reporting of bites and scratches but we
haven't typically emphasized environmental splashes as B virus exposures.
Eye protection has been aimed mainly at preventing chemical or physical eye
injury or is used around chimpanzees that are spitters or throwers.
Possible changes in policy and procedures that will result are still being
determined, but I suspect that the following, at least, will likely occur.
A "medic-alert" type, laminated card with instructions and phone numbers
will be issued to all personnel, to alert "non-system" physicians who may
be consulted of the risk of B-virus exposure and whom to contact for
information. Eye protection will probably be required to work with
monkeys, regardless of the procedures being conducted, and training
procedures will probably be amended to give more emphasis to the
possibility of mucosal exposures.
