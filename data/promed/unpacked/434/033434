Echinococcosis - Kazakhstan
--------------------------------
Echinococcosis is a global problem in human and veterinary medicine,
and its prophylaxis is a major problem in regional health care. The
WHO includes echinococcosis in the list of diseases demanding
immediate attention.
A press release from the regional government of the Zhambylskiy
region (Kazakhstan) states that the state sanitary epidemiological
service has initiated a campaign to fight echinococcosis called "We
Shall Stop Echinococcosis in Taraz" [a town in the Zhambylskiy region
- Mod.NP]. Representatives of the regional government, the health
service, scientists, public associations and Zhambyl high schools
students have all taken part in the campaign.
A high prevalence of echinococcosis has been observed over the past
years in Western Kazakhstan, Almaty, Southern Kazakhstan and Zhambyl
regions. Approximately 2000 people are surgically treated for
echinococcosis [to remove the cysts -- see comment below] every year
in Kazakhstan. In rural areas of the Zhambylskiy region, for example,
50 percent of dogs are infected by _Echinococcus_.
It is believed that the increasing prevalence in humans is caused by
weakened veterinary supervision, the discontinued centralized
slaughter of animals, and an absence of appropriate disposal of
[animal] corpses.

[In the territories of the Former Soviet Union, echinococcosis is
prevalent in Moldova, the republics of Transcaucasia and Central
Asia, in Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine and Belarus. - Mod.NP]
[The main host of the_Echinococcus granulosus_ tapeworm is the dog
and other canines, for instance foxes. The infected dogs shed eggs in
their feces, which are ingested by the secondary host, for instance
pigs, sheep or cows, hatch into larvae and migrate in the body and
form space-occupying lesions called hydatid cysts. If the secondary
host dies and the carcass is left for dogs to prey on, the larvae
will infected the dog, which will start shedding eggs, further
spreading the infection. -- see life cycle:

Thus, control relies on treatment of infected dogs, veterinary
control of livestock and disposal of infected animals. - Mod.EP/JW]
