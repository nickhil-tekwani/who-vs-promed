On 18 Dec 2018, a man aged 87 years was evaluated in a hospital emergency department in Flushing, New York, for right lower abdominal quadrant pain. Evaluation included a computed tomography scan, which showed acute appendicitis with multiple abscesses measuring 3 cm or smaller. The patient was admitted, a percutaneous drain was placed, and 5 mL of an opaque jelly-like substance was aspirated and sent for culture and testing for antimicrobial sensitivities.

Gram stain of the culture revealed gram-negative rods, and culture revealed monomicrobial 1- to 2-mm yellowish-brown mucoid colonies (after inoculation of specimen on sheep blood agar, chocolate agar, and MacKonkey agar plates and incubation at 98.6 deg F (37 deg C), beta-hemolysis was observed on the blood agar plates). Sequencing of the isolate's 16S ribosomal RNA revealed greater than 99.8% homology with _Shewanella haliotis_ strain DW01 in the GenBank database. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that the isolate was susceptible to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, certain penicillins, and broad-spectrum cephalosporins (Table). Biochemical tests were performed to characterize isolate (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/83522). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that _S. haliotis_ strain DW01 is the most recent ancestor of this clinical isolate. This is the 1st documented case of an _S. haliotis_ appendix infection.

_S. haliotis_ is an emerging human pathogen, 1st isolated from abalone gut microflora in 2007 (1). The geographic distribution of human infections caused by _S. haliotis_ is concentrated in Asia, with most reports coming from China, Japan, South Korea, and Thailand (2). No cases of _S. haliotis_ human infections had been reported in the World Health Organization's Region of the Americas.

The patient was treated empirically with intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam while in the hospital and was discharged with a prescription for oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. At a follow-up visit 13 days later, he was recovering well. Empiric treatment of _Shewanella_ spp. can be challenging; limited and varying antibiotic susceptibility profiles have been reported (2,3). This patient's isolate was susceptible to several classes of antimicrobials, but resistance to certain antibiotics has been observed in this isolate and others (2). In a case series of 16 patients from Martinique, _Shewanella_ spp. sensitivities to piperacillin-tazobactam and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were reported to be 98% and 75%, respectively (3).

Risk factors for or potential vectors of _Shewanella_ spp. infections are unidentified in up to 40%-50% of cases (4). _S. haliotis_ is ecologically distributed in marine environments, including broad contamination of cultivated shellfish. Although infection following consumption of seafood is seldom reported (5), consumption of raw seafood could be an important vehicle for foodborne illnesses and outbreaks. This patient reported consuming raw salmon 10 days before becoming ill but had no other marine exposures or exposure to ill contacts. The time from potential exposure to onset of abdominal pain in this patient is consistent with that reported in the literature on _Shewanella_ spp. (3-49 days). The epidemiologic exposure history supports the link between raw fish consumption and infection.

No other organisms were isolated in this patient; in the Martinique case series of _Shewanella_ spp., one-half of infections were monomicrobial as well (3). This case highlights the importance of preventing seafood-associated infections and the need to consider rare human pathogens in elderly or immunocompromised, marine-exposed populations, as well as persons who might consume at-risk food that might have been imported from outside the USA and persons who might have been infected outside the USA when traveling.

[_Shewanella_ is a genus of gram-negative bacilli that has more than 60 species. Most are detected in marine environments. Many human infections are linked to shellfish ingestion or aquatic exposure (https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cjidmm/2018/9895148/). _Shewanella putrefaciens_ and _Shewanella algae_ are the most common _Shewanella_ clinical isolates. _Shewanella haliotis_ was 1st reported as a human pathogen in Japan in 2010 (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/6/12-1607_article). The species name for _Shewanella haliotis_ derives from the genus name for abalones, _Haliotis_, from which it was 1st isolated, in specimens that had been collected from the ocean near Yeosu, South Korea in 2007 (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/6/ET-1906_article). The above MMWR report mentions that _Shewanella haliotis_ has been isolated from human infections in Asia, mainly from China, Japan, South Korea, and Thailand, but not from "World Health Organization's Region of the Americas".

An article referenced by the MMWR report above cites 16 human cases of _Shewanella_ infection from Martinique, which, although geographically located in the Caribbean, is one of the Overseas Departments of France (together with Guadeloupe, La Reunion, Mayotte and French Guiana). Martinique is considered an outermost region of the European Union (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinique#Governance) and is not included in the World Health Organization's Region of the Americas (https://www.who.int/choice/demography/american_region/en/). However, it should be noted that these 16 cases from Martinique and over 200 cases in the literature since 1973 that were reviewed by this article (http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.13-0055#html_fulltext) were infected by _S. putrefaciens_ or _S. algae_, not _S. haliotis_. - Mod.ML
