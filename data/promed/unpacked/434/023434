The number of cases of a contagious diarrheal disease in central Ohio topped 600 this week, following the holiday weekend and the unofficial end of summer and swimming pool season. Cases of cryptosporidiosis in Franklin and Delaware counties had reached 511 as of 2 Sep 2016, according to Franklin County Public Health.

Cryptosporidiosis is caused by a microscopic parasite that is spread through feces and can cause infection when swallowed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The parasite moves through water and is resistant to chlorine disinfection.

The illness also can spread through human-to-human contact. The 2-county cryptosporidiosis outbreak is the largest one that health departments in Columbus and Franklin and Delaware counties have seen in15 years.

The disease occurs often in isolated cases, but health officials say outbreaks are less common. The last time central Ohio encountered a significant number of cases was in 2008, when Delaware and Franklin counties logged nearly 350 cases.

Health officials had reached out to pool operators, physicians, schools and day-care centers about the outbreak. Many local pools have been "hyper-chlorinated" to flush out traces of the disease before the pools closed for the season.

Health officials say people who are sick should stay home from school or day care and avoid pools and water parks, where cryptosporidiosis and other diseases easily pass from person to person. An infected person can spread the disease long after diarrhea subsides and should avoid swimming for at least 2 weeks.

To help avoid getting sick, people should practice frequent hand-washing, wash with soap before and after swimming, and avoid swallowing water. Parents should take toddlers and young children on frequent bathroom breaks and ensure that children who aren't toilet-trained use a swim diaper.

[It is intriguing that the same 2 counties, Delaware and Franklin, experienced an outbreak in 2008, nearly 350 cases. As habits regarding recreational water usage and personal hygiene probably does not differ a lot within the USA, it is worth looking at contamination of the water supply in these 2 counties. Especially important is the water source, especially if surface water is used in the municipal water supply. - Mod.EP
