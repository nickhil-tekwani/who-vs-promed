The Moderator has posed the question - is merely proving the presence of
_Mycobacterium bovis_ proof of infection? The answer depends on the viewing
window.
If you wish to exterminate the agent from a particular population then
culture of _M. bovis_ might have to be the gold standard. A disease state
is the combination of agent(s) plus host reaction. In tuberculosis while
organisms may be cultured from the respiratory tract and other sites it is
generally accepted that the existence of a primary complex is necessary to
provide anatomical evidence of infection. It is known that in cattle
culture of lymph nodes will detect up to 6% more "infected" animals than
the most detailed visual post-mortem inspection (Lepper et al 1991). In a
study by this Department, examinations of "no visible lesion" reactors to
the single intradermal tuberculin test, 4 of 517 yielded _M. bovis_ on
culture of mediastinal, bronchial and retropharyngeal lymph nodes.
The question then arises - is this culture positive state early infection
or some form of commensal state. Certainly it has been known since the last
century that even the primary focus in cattle may remain latent for many
years or at the most progress only very slightly (M'Fadyean in 1899). It
has also been believed that when only small numbers of _M. bovis_ enter an
alveolus they are frequently destroyed before they are able to produce a
macroscopic lesion, - otherwise the dispersion of infection through lung
tissue would be markedly different from the usual focal lesions found.
When using the eradication "viewing window" we often take the conservative
option and consider any evidence of _M. bovis_ organisms a risk. However
the evidence for this is not absolute. In many cases we find single last
lesioned animals in herds, which may have exposed other animals but no
further spread of the disease has occurred. Unfortunately it takes many
years of rigorous monitoring to be sure of this and because of time
constraints on eradication programs, removal of exposed animals is carried
out to increase certainty of eradication.
