CJD CASE HOSPITAL SETS UP HELPLINE FOR MOTHERS
-----------------------------------------------
A hospital today set up a telephone helpline for women who were treated
with surgical instruments used to deliver a baby whose mother was suffering
from the human form of mad cow disease.
The George Eliot Hospital in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, issued the number for
mothers who underwent Caesarean sections at the hospital's maternity ward
between 26 October 1999 and 29 January 2000.
The instruments, which may have been contaminated with the agent which
causes new variant Creutzfeld Jakob Disease (nvCJD), were re-used in 7
Caesarean sections before the mother was diagnosed as having the disease.
George Eliot's chief executive Nick Carver said the hospital was relieved a
court injunction banning identification of the hospital had been varied. Mr
Carver added: "We are pleased the injunction has been relaxed, enabling any
women who have any concerns at all to contact us directly. As soon as we
were aware the woman concerned had a potential diagnosis of nvCJD we
removed the kit from circulation."
Mr. Carver said the helpline, which can be contacted between 6 a.m. and
midnight on 024 7686 5555, had received 70 calls today. He added "advised
scientific opinion" was the risk to any of the women being infected with
CJD was extremely low. The equipment which was re-used was properly washed
and sterilised between operations.
Earlier this month, Dr. Rod Griffiths, the West Midlands' Director of
Public Health, said the risk the women had been infected with CJD during
the subsequent births was "vanishingly small". Dr. Griffiths added that
staff at the hospital had followed proper procedures, removing the surgical
instruments from use as soon as the mother's condition was known.
The doctor added it was theoretically possible for the prion which causes
CJD to remain on instruments after operations, but it was usually removed
simply by washing prior to sterilization.
Asked to quantify the risk to those mothers exposed to the instruments, Dr.
Griffiths added: "When something has never happened, you don't know whether
it's one-in-a-million or one-in-a-thousand."
The mother diagnosed as having CJD gave birth last autumn, but she cannot
be named for legal reasons. Her baby daughter is thought to be suffering
from a neurological condition and doctors are understood to be awaiting the
result of tests to see if she has CJD.
CJD victims display symptoms of dementia, becoming unsteady, confused and
losing their memory. Death normally occurs about 6 months after the onset
of the disease. The nvCJD is the human form of so-called mad cow disease,
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). New variant CJD has been linked to
the consumption of beef infected with BSE.

[It would appear the hospital is taking some responsibility for its
actions. Furthermore, I think this posting emphasis what Dr. Calisher was
saying in a previous post: washing/cleansing the instruments prior to
sterilizing or autoclaving is critically important. - Mod.TG
