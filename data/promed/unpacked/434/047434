Prevention

11 Aug 2015: Liberia expands cross border screening to combat spread of Ebola

14 Aug 2015 Sierra Leone: Ban on secret societies still in force - Palo Conteh
http://awoko.org/2015/08/14/sierra-leone-news-ban-on-secret-societies-still-in-force-palo-conteh/
[Chief executive officer (CEO) of National Ebola Response Centre (NERC), retired Major Palo Conteh has said the ban on all secret societies across the country is still in force, and nobody should engage in those practices until the Ebola outbreak is over. Conteh also said, "I have been informed of secret society activities commencing in some districts across the country. Let me clearly state again that the ban on secret society activities is maintained. I strongly encourage you to note these words as anybody caught engaging in such activities, will face the full force of the law."]

[From the website of the European Union: "As the custodians of traditions and customs, [secret societies in Sierra Leone] have played a major role in the Ebola outbreak -- both in fuelling the spread of the disease through traditional practices such as burial rituals, and in helping curb transmission through awareness raising and behaviour change." https://europa.eu/eyd2015/en/plan-international/events/ebola-secret-societies-sierra-leone.

14 Aug 2015 Senegal: must still be vigilant against Ebola
http://www.voanews.com/content/senegal-still-vigilant-against-ebola/2918463.html
[At University Hospital Fann in Dakar, Dr Moussa Seydi, head of the infectious diseases unit who treated the country's only Ebola case, said the country needs to remain on alert. "There are a few failures since we solved the 1st case," Seydi said. "You'll see that basic sanitary measures are being neglected. People used to wash their hands regularly and avoided certain acts, but now people are behaving like there's never been an Ebola case here." For that reason, Senegalese officials will start a new campaign to remind people about the dangers of Ebola, health minister Awa Marie Coll Seck told VOA recently.]

[UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) said there had been no reported cases of students or teachers contracting Ebola at a school this year in the 3 worst-hit countries in West Africa]

13 Aug 2015 Liberia: Ebola infections 17 times less likely in communities that participated in community-led total sanitation
http://www.trust.org/item/20150813175747-nma18/
[Global Communities today released results of a study to examine whether communities in Liberia stood a better chance of resisting Ebola during the outbreak of the past 18 months if they participated in efforts to achieve Open Defecation-Free (ODF) status. The study confirmed that a representative sample drawn from 284 Liberian communities that achieved ODF status by participating in the Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) process were Ebola-free despite their proximity to Ebola hotspots. Communities that began but did not complete the CLTS process also experienced significant protection and were 17-times less likely to experience Ebola virus disease infections]

Control
-------
August 2015 Liberia: Ebola survivors clinic opens in Monrovia
http://www.who.int/features/2015/ebola-survivors-clinic/en/
[According to Alex Gasasira, the WHO representative in Liberia, "Beyond treatment of the symptoms, there are many things we simply do not understand about what happens to these patients after they are cured. These clinics not only provide support for the patients, but provide valuable research data to help us determine the cause and best course of treatment."

In addition to addressing these symptoms more generally, the Ebola Survivors Clinic in Redemption is also hosting its Men's Health Screening Program, where free semen testing for Ebola virus is offered to willing male survivors who are sexually active, as well as sexual health counseling and condom distribution. The goal is to enable them to make informed choices about their sexual health and be able to protect their partners from possible sexual transmission of Ebola. This work is also critical for research to see precisely how long remnants of the virus may survive in semen and in the eyes, as viral sanctuaries. It is thought that transmission of the virus by survivors is a very rare event but it is important to understand how long the virus persists and to ensure that survivors practise safe sex.]

http://www.msf.ca/en/article/the-ebola-fight-isn-t-over-msf-international-president-dr-joanne-liu-on-what-it-will-take-to
[The goal is to get to zero patients for 42 days -- twice the incubation period of the virus -- after which a country or region can be declared Ebola-free. To cross that finish line, perseverance -- if not sheer stubbornness -- is needed, continuing to thoroughly trace every person in contact with an Ebola patient, to identify and respond to new cases early, and to make sure that burials are carried out safely.]

13 Aug 2015 Sierra Leone: USD 1.9m post-ebola project to re-skill burial team
http://awoko.org/2015/08/12/sierra-leone-news-1-9m-post-ebola-project-to-re-skill-burial-team

12 Aug 2015 Liberia: In US Ebola response empty ETUs to expend over USD 5 million
http://allafrica.com/stories/201508120989.html
[Behind the Ganta Methodist Hospital sits an Ebola Treatment Unit which is considered "state of the art" by experts -- but since its opening in January 2015, the center has not had any confirmed Ebola patients. With no Ebola patients, the center operated by Project Concern International (PCI) has exhausted almost 60 per cent of USD 5.6 million provided by the US government for its operation.]
