At a time when the deadly novel coronavirus has resulted in more than 200 000 human deaths and a constant extension of the lockdown in the country, a new virus, causing lumpy skin disease [LSD], seems to be affecting cattle in and across Telangana. LSD, as it has been named, has been threatening white cattle across the country.

According to sources, it was around Ugadi (a festival celebrated during late March) when this condition, caused by a Capripox virus, was observed in cattle in Odisha, Maharashtra and other states. It soon spread across Telangana too, affecting thousands of white cattle in Warangal, Mahabubabad, Vikarabad, Jogulamba Gadwal, Wanaparthy, Bhadradri Kothagudem, Adilabad, Yadadri Bhuvanagiri and other districts in [Telangana]. East and West Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh have also been badly affected by the disease.

It was around 15 days before the announcement of the lockdown when it was 1st observed in Kollapur, Veepanagandla, Pangal, Gadwal and Pebbair areas of Palamuru [Mahbub Nagar] region.

It is believed that people from neighbouring states that come to sell their cattle in the Pebbair Santha, the largest cattle market in Pebbair, led to the rapid spread of the virus in Wanaparthy and the nearby districts of Palamuru region.

A farmer from Suguru village of Pebbair Mandal said: "I had purchased a pair of male calves from Pebbair Santha last year [2019] for Rs 50 000 [USD 671]. Last month [April 2020], cattle brought to the village to graze by some people had the virus, and 10 of their cattle died due to the virus. The virus must have spread in the village from those cattle."

According to Ganesh Reddy, Veterinary Assistant of 4 villages under his jurisdiction, 314 cases were identified with symptoms of LSD, which is a highly infectious disease.

[According to India's OIE notification, LSD was recorded as starting in India's northeastern state Orisha on 12 Aug 2019. Remarkably, the disease's 1st outbreak in Bangladesh, separated from Orisha by India's state West Bengal, reportedly started (in the district Anwara) on 14 Jul 2019. A 2nd outbreak in Bangladesh reportedly started on 28 Jul 2019 in the district Narayanganj, about 200 km [124 mi] distant from the 1st one. The total number of outbreaks reported from Bangladesh is 4; most probably, the disease has been under-reported.

Though the route of introduction to India has not been established, chronologically it is tempting to assume that LSD spread from Bangladesh to India, where it has spread since in a southwesterly direction, most probably by movements of infected cattle, as is apparent from the information in the above report. Transmission of LSD virus (LSDV) is thought to be predominantly by arthropods, natural contact transmission in the absence of vectors being inefficient.

OIE's global LSD map, presenting all outbreaks reported since January 2018, is available at https://tinyurl.com/ya6sk6vr (click on Bangladesh, zoom in to the required resolution).

Lumpy skin disease (LSD, knopvelsiekte) is a poxvirus disease of cattle characterised by fever, nodules on the skin, mucous membranes and internal organs, emaciation, enlarged lymph nodes, oedema of the skin, and sometimes death. The disease is of economic importance, as it can cause a temporary reduction in milk production, temporary or permanent sterility in bulls, damage to hides, and death due to secondary bacterial infections. - Mod.AS
