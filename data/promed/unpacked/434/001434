A deadly bee disease outbreak of American foulbrood disease (AFB) is killing thousands of honeybees a day and is crippling the bee-farming industry.

Although the outbreak has been reported only in the Western Cape, its spread would have a negative and massive impact on the South African economy. The South African Bee Industry (Sabi) said farmers were working around the clock to control the spread of the deadly disease.

Sabi chair Mike Miles said the disease outbreak has caused honey production to drop by 1/3rd-and-a-half. He said the scary reality was there is no cure for the disease, and bee farmers needed to be 100 percent careful in their work to prevent it spreading. Miles noted the disease was 1st discovered in 2009, but in recent months had grown uncontrollably in most parts of the Western Cape.

"A piece of good news is that the disease does not affect humans when consuming contaminated honey products," he said. Should the contaminated honey products reach other parts of the country, Miles said, this could continue the spread of the disease. AFB is a highly contagious disease that kills bee embryos up to 3 days old which ingest the spore-forming bacterium. Honey products are used in the making of many products such as cereals, cough medicines, bakery products and many more.

"Right now, we are appealing to farmers to take extra precautions and for the retail industry to be aware of where its honey products come from," he said. Miles said beekeepers were working around the clock to prevent Western Cape honey products from leaving the province. "As much as we can import honey cheaper from other countries, we cannot import the pollination service done by bees. If not controlled, the disease would also affect the fruit industry, which contributes a lot to the South African economy, and put food security at risk," he said.

[American foulbrood (AFB) is caused by _Paenibacillus larvae_, a spore-forming gram-positive bacterium. AFB is a severe and notiÔ¨Åable disease of honeybees. _P. larvae_ is endemic to bee colonies worldwide. Spores are highly resilient and can survive in honey for years.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores remaining at the base of a brood cell. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age. Larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours after the egg has hatched.

Larvae can be killed rapidly at an early age when they are curled at the base of uncapped brood cells. Adult worker bees will remove these dead larvae leaving only an empty cell. Other larvae will die later on in their development, when they are in an upright position, filling most of the brood cell. Often the larvae or pupae will die after brood cell capping.
