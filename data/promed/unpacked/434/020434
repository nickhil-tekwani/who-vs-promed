A fisherman who lived in Victoria in Entre Rios province died after
having contracted [a] hantavirus [infection], according to the
laboratory confirmation reported by health authorities. The patient
died on Monday [18 Oct 2010] in the San Martin de Parana Hospital,
and the Secretary of Health Management, Pbalo Basso, confirmed the
positive result of laboratory tests carried out by the Maiztegui Institute.

The official pointed out that "no other clinical case" was detected
among the family members of the victim, a man of 43 years. "Given the
suspected [case], the house that [the man] inhabited and the place
where the man worked were examined, and there is no other clinical
case," said Basso. He also confirmed that "surveillance in the area
is being done because the incubation period can vary in some cases."
He reminded the people of the need to take extra hygiene measures to
avoid new cases because hantavirus infections occur through
inhalation of rodent secretions [containing the virus].

The fisherman who died on Monday [18 Oct 2010] had been hospitalized
Saturday [16 Oct 2010] in Victoria with a clinical picture of [a]
hantavirus [infection].

[This report does not indicate which hantavirus was involved in this
case. As indicated in ProMED-mail archive no. 20060822.2370,
hantaviruses in South America are maintained in sigmodontine rodents.
Several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in
Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy
rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), related Andes-like
viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown),
Lechiguana (in central Argentina in _O. flavescens_), Oran (in
northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_), and Bermejo (western
Argentina in _O. flavescens_) virus. This case may have been caused
by Lechiguana virus infection, but without laboratory confirmation,
it is not possible to say with certainty.

The CDC has an excellent Power Point presentation on hantaviruses
available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/noframes/hpsslideset/hpsslides1-12.htm>.

Victoria is a city in the southwest of the province of Entre Rios,
