[According to the monthly WHO risk assessment at the Animal-Human interface; 'As of 16 March 2017, a total of 1307 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses, including at least 489 deaths, have been reported to WHO.

According to reports received by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on surveillance activities for avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses in China, positives among virological samples continue to be detected mainly from live bird markets, vendors and some commercial or breeding farms' [http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_03_16_2017.pdf?ua=1].

Most human cases are exposed to the influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases of influenza A(H7N9) in other provinces in China that have not yet reported human cases are also expected. - Mod.UBA]
