Some highlights:


* A total of 9 suspected cases v- CJD have been reported in Germany,
including 6 farmers in the 12 months to October 1994, 2 in the butchery
trade, an animal dealer and a catering assistant who frequently handled
calves' brains.... Since 1985 more than 40,000 tons of British beef were
exported to Germany. Der Spiegel 1.4.96 [To claim that these 6 farmers and
2 butchery trade individuals were affected as a result of occupational
exposure to British beef would be difficult. MHJ]

* In France 2 herds of cattle in which cases of BSE were reported in May
were destroyed. There have been 18 cases since 1991.
International Herald Tribune 7.5.96, p5/Daily Telegraph 4.5.96, p11

Since 1991 there had only been 16 cases of BSE (but 3 new cases were
reported in Brittany in January 1996), in each case involving the slaughter
of the entire herd, amounting to more than 1000 cattle in total.

In France cases of CJD occurring in recent years were re-examined in the
light of the discovery of V-CJD. In 1992-94, in addition to cases seen in
patients formerly treated by growth hormone extracts, 135 cases were
identified (about 0.8 cases per million population per year). Of these
cases 5 were in the younger age group associated with V-CJD.
* Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Canada

Between 1979 and 1993 there were 334 deaths attributed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease in Canada (before 1979 CJD was not listed as a cause of death and
it has not been a notifiable disease in Canada), ranging from 14 to 34 a
year.

* In a report to the Standing Veterinary Committee of the EU a team of
inspectors found that the BSE outbreak in Switzerland was under control and
there had been no concealment. Some 300 tons of condemned meat and bonemeal
was being burnt at a cement factory inSwitzerland to produce clinker. The
meal is hermetically sealed and burnt at the rate of 1.5 tons/h.
Neue Archer Zeitung 17.5.96

Out of 210 cases of BSE in Switzerland to date, 7 were in animals born
since the ban on feeding suspect concentrates came into force in November
1990. The 2 most recent cases were worrying because after careful
examination they could not be attributed to contaminated feed.
