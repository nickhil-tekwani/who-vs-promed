Viet Nam: another human case of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection
confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Viet Nam has confirmed that the death of a
14-month-old boy early this month [September 2004] was caused by avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection. This is the 3rd death from the virus in
Viet Nam since August [2004]. The baby in Hanoi had typical symptoms of
avian influenza virus infection, including fever and cough. He died on 5
Sep 2004, about a week after catching the virus.
On Tue 28 Sep 2004, the World Health Organization said people shouldn't be
alarmed by the death of a woman who caught bird flu from her daughter in
Thailand. It said that it is not yet a serious threat for the general public.

[As of 28 Sep 2004,
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2004_09
_28/en/>
the WHO lists the total number of laboratory confirmed human cases of avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in East Asia as 42, including 30 deaths;
15 of the cases, and 10 of the deaths, have occurred in Thailand, and 27
cases with 20 deaths have occurred in Viet Nam. The updated figures
includes one fatal case that occurred in Viet Nam in mid-March [2004] but
has only recently been officially confirmed. The other changes reflect 4
recent cases, all fatal, reported from Viet Nam since early August [2004].
Of these 4 cases, 3 have been confirmed as caused by the H5N1 strain. For
the remaining case, infection with influenza A H5 subtype virus has been
laboratory confirmed. The death of the child described in the News Agency
report may mean that the overall figure for deaths is now 31. - Mod.CP]
