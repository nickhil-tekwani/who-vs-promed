Chikungunya hits Pune, 138 cases in Indapur taluka, 3 villages
affected; health officials fear it will spread to more talukas
-----------------------------------------------
Having swept parts of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharahstra,
chikungunya, the relatively rare viral fever with dengue-like
symptoms, has reached Pune, with 138 cases being detected from the
villages of Nimgaon, Ketaki and Bhongwadi in Indapur taluka.
Zilla Parishad officials told Pune Newsline that it was likely that
the disease could infect other areas, like Purandar, Mulshi, Haveli
and Bhor talukas. Last year [2005], several cases of dengue, which is
also a viral disease transmitted by the same group of _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes, were reported in Indapur, Baramati and Purandar talukas.
Hence, officials are not ruling out the spread of chikungunya in these areas.
Chikungunya has already infected various parts of Maharashtra,
including Aurangabad, Latur, Nashik and Akola, and Pune is the fresh
entrant to the list of affected districts in the state.
Medical experts from the National Institute of Virology [NIV] in Pune
said chikungunya has come from Kyasanur forest in Karnataka, but it
is rarely fatal. Symptoms appear between 4 and 7 days after the
patient has been bitten by the infected mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_. A
high fever and headache occur, with significant pains in the joints
(ankles and wrists), which can persist for several weeks. The main
preventive measure is to stop the proliferation of mosquitoes by
cleaning up their breeding grounds.
The health officials have already taken preventive measures and have
urged the villagers to observe one "dry" day by emptying the water
from the containers. They have also instructed the villagers not to
store water for more than 5 days.
In the last 3 months, the official count of the affected has climbed
to a staggering 1.5 lakh [i.e. 100 000] people, and health officials
concede that figures on the ground may be higher. Health officials in
Delhi said the last outbreak in the country was reported in 1974.
"The virus must have been silent, but it has made a comeback," said
an official.
The name chikungunya comes from Swahili and means "that which bends
up," reflecting the physique of the person suffering from the
disease. It occurs principally during the rainy season.

1241 cases of chikungunya detected
-----------------------------------------
About 1241 cases of chikungunya disease have been detected in the
district, according to a press note issued by the district administration.
A coordination committee meeting of district officials was held here
recently, and it has been decided to carry out an awareness campaign
in the villages in the district.
A press note issued here on Saturday [29 Apr 2006] said that 674
cases were reported in Muddebihal taluk, 392 in Sindgi, 91 in Indi,
31 in Basvan Bagewadi and 53 in Bijapur taluks.
The health officials informed the meeting that about 49 blood samples
were sent to NIV, Pune and NIV, Bangalore for further analysis.
Four cases of the disease have been confirmed. Surveillance
committees have been formed at the taluk [an administrative
subdivision] and the district levels, the officials said.
