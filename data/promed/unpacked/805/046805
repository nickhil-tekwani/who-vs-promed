A 10-year-old Egyptian girl has tested positive for H5N1 avian
influenza virus infection, becoming the 25th human case in the most
populous Arab country, a World Health Organisation (WHO) official
said on Wed 14 Mar 2007.
"It occurred inside Aswan, in an urban area, and we don't have many
details at this point in time," said Hassan al-Bushra, regional
adviser for communicable disease surveillance for WHO. Bushra added
that the girl would be transferred to Cairo for treatment.
State news agency MENA quoted a health ministry spokesman as saying
that the girl had been admitted to a hospital in Aswan, 450 km. (280
miles) south of Cairo, on Tuesday [13 Mar 2007] suffering from fever
and muscle pains, and that tests confirmed [the patient] had the H5N1
virus. She was treated with the antiviral drug Tamiflu, and was
stable. He added that her family was being kept under observation.
On Sunday [11 Mar 2007], WHO and the Egyptian health ministry said a
4-year-old boy had contracted the deadly bird flu virus, and was
receiving Tamiflu.
According to WHO the virus has killed 168 people since 2003 and at
least 200 million birds have died or been culled.
