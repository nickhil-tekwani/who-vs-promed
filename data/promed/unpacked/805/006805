Botulism case in Queensland
----------------
Scientists believe an outbreak of botulism on a farm near Brisbane which
has killed 14 000 chickens is an isolated case.
Dr Ron Glanville, of Queensland's Department of Primary Industries (DPI),
said he did not believe the outbreak on a Redlands broiler farm would
spread. "We don't believe there's any problem at all for other farms," he said.
Scientists have traced the outbreak to litter in the sheds on the farm of
96 000 chickens. "We think it's probably something happened in the shed
enabling the botulism organisms to grow," Dr Glanville said.
"The botulism organism is fairly ubiquitous and would be on all farms. It's
just under certain circumstances, the organisms can germinate and grow and
get to the stage where they're producing toxins."
Dr Glanville said the DPI would continue to monitor the farm.
The dead birds, which perished over a 20-day period, have been buried and
the farm is in the process of being cleaned. Dr Glanville said it was the
first big case of botulism recorded on a Queensland farm.
