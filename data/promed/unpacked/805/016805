[Although this is an old report (June), the discussion of the effect of
the outbreak on Argentina's status in meat exports is relevant. -

Foot-and-mouth to be long-time woe for Argentina
-------------------------------------------
Argentina will not be able to eliminate foot & mouth disease (FMD)
until the end of 2002 or the beginning of 2003, though the number of
outbreaks should begin to decline between July and September,
Argentina's agriculture secretary said Tuesday.
The latest outbreak of the highly contagious virus, which the
government officially recognized in March [2001, was the first in
nearly 7 years and came less than a year after the country won the
prized status of "free of FMD without vaccination."
The government in April [2001 began a campaign to vaccinate 98
percent of the nearly 50-million strong cattle herd in a bid to stamp out
the virus. Even if the outbreaks are brought under control, the virus
will not technically be completely eliminated in the country because it
is present in the vaccines.
"I expect by the end of next year, there will be no FMD outbreaks. That
would come about through the revaccination of the herd," said
Agriculture Secretary Marcelo Regunaga.
Health officials, who have found over 1300 outbreaks, expect to
complete the first round of vaccinations by the end of June [2001.
Regunaga said the number of outbreaks was growing exponentially,
with most concentrated in Buenos Aires province, the country's main
cattle-raising region. "Starting in July, we expect the number of
outbreaks to begin to decrease, and that trend will be strengthened in
September when the second round of vaccination ends," Regunaga
added.
The outbreaks led to the loss of Argentina's disease-free status [and
denial of access to major export markets, putting in danger some $600
million in meat exports.
The Agriculture Department decided Monday to push up the starting
date for the second round of vaccinations and increase limitations on
the movement of cattle to avoid the spread of the virus.
Regunaga said Argentina should not have stopped vaccinating 3 years
ago and emphasized the need to work with neighboring countries
affected by the illness ­ Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil and Bolivia -- to
eradicate it throughout the region. "Under my administration we will
not stop vaccinating. I do not support ending the vaccination campaign
until the neighboring countries are FMD[-free," he explained.
"Especially if they cannot control their borders. It shouldn't even cross
our minds to stop vaccinating until at least 2003," he said.
Argentina is negotiating the possible reopening of markets in the
European Union, the country's main export market for beef, and Chile,
after the countries banned Argentine meat because of a lack of clear
information on the health status of the country's cattle. "We need to
win the confidence of countries that have suspended our beef. It's
going to take a while (to reopen those markets) because we have to
rebuild the confidence we lost," said Regunaga.
The agriculture secretary said exports of meat to Europe could begin
again in September, though the outlook for beginning exports to
Canada and the United States again in the near term is negative.
"That's a long way away. In order to enter those markets, we have to
have foot & mouth [disease under control. That means there are no
outbreaks," said Regunaga. "That's not a situation we can expect to
enjoy in the short term. It's not on this year's horizon."
