The Virginia Department of Health confirmed [Fri 19 Aug 2016] that 10 people have been infected with hepatitis A after eating at Tropical Smoothie Cafes across the Commonwealth. The health department warned people who had eaten at the cafes after frozen strawberries imported from Egypt likely contained the virus.

Officials said customers who consumed a smoothie made with the possibly tainted berries between 5 and 8 Aug 2016 should contact the health department because they may still benefit from the vaccine. "Anyone who consumed a smoothie with frozen strawberries at a restaurant within the last 50 days is encouraged to watch for symptoms of hepatitis A," officials said. "If illness occurs, seek medical care and take steps to protect others from the infection."

"Jaundice is a classic sign of hepatitis A, so that's a yellowing of the skin and whites of eyes. There are a lot of non-specific symptoms [like] fever, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting," Seth Levine, an epidemiologist with the Virginia Department of Health, said. People who have been vaccinated for hepatitis A are not at risk, officials said. Additionally, health experts stressed customers who consumed a smoothie after the strawberries were pulled from restaurants are not be at risk. However, officials are uncertain if other restaurants may also have received the frozen berries.

VDH said their investigation into the incident is ongoing and that they are working with the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the FDA and the CDC. It is unclear how the fruit may have been contaminated, but officials said there have been previous outbreaks involving frozen strawberries from Egypt. As of [Fri 19 Aug 2016] afternoon, the fruit was still being tested to make sure it was
the source of the outbreak.

An official with Tropical Smoothie in Central Virginia said the strawberries were removed from stores 7 Aug 2016 and replaced with strawberries from Mexico and California.

[Given that this is thought to be from an imported product, it seems likely that it will involve other locations. The ages of those infected are not stated but are likely to be adults or children born outside the USA since universal HAV vaccine is part of standard childhood immunization in the USA. Additionally, there are likely to be substantially more cases as even in adults, many of the cases are subclinical or anicteric. - Mod.LL
