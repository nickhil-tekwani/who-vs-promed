China: Human Bocavirus Infection Confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
Chinese scientists have diagnosed a child suffering from respiratory
illness as being infected with human bocavirus, which was identified
only last year [2005], an official newspaper reported on Monday [21
Aug 2006]. The child, from Chenzhou in the central Chinese province
of Hunan, had been admitted to hospital with a severe respiratory
infection, the Guangming Daily said. DNA tests then confirmed the
child had contracted the virus, the newspaper said. It did not give
other details about the case.
Last August 2005, Swedish researchers said they had identified a
previously unknown virus that may cause many cases of serious
respiratory infections in children. They named the virus human
bocavirus and suggested researchers start a systematic search for all
the viruses that cause respiratory infections.
The report, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences [Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2005 Sep 6;102(36):12891-6. Epub
2005 Aug 23)], underlined how little doctors know about the sources
of most respiratory infections.
Health experts say being able to quickly diagnose and treat
respiratory illnesses is particularly important, especially with
growing fears that influenza, in particular avian influenza, could
cause a global pandemic. China has reported 21 cases of bird flu in
humans. Being able to find out quickly what is making someone sick
will allow antiviral medications to be dispensed early on to prevent
serious illness in the case of influenza.

[In 2005 a group of Swedish scientists published a description of a
novel parvovirus present in the lower respiratory tract of infants.
(See: Cloning of a human parvovirus by molecular screening of
respiratory tract samples; by Allander T, Tammi MT, Eriksson M, .
Bjerkner A, Tiveljung-Lindell A, Andersson B. At the Department of
Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm,
Sweden. Published in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005 Oct 25;102(43):15712).
The family _Parvoviridae_ is divided into 2 subfamilies,
_Densovirinae_, which infects arthropods, and _Parvovirinae_, which
infects birds and mammals. There is no sequence homology between the
_Densovirinae_ and _Parvovirinae_. The viruses in the _Parvovirinae_
have recently been reclassified into 5 genera by the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses: _Parvovirus_, _Erythrovirus_,
_Dependovirus_, _Amdovirus_, and _Bocavirus_. The previously known
human parvoviruses are the well known pathogen parvovirus B19 (genus
_Erythrovirus_) and the presumably apathogenic adeno-associated
viruses (genus _Dependovirus_). The genus _Bocavirus_ comprised 2
viruses: bovine bocavirus and canine minute virus. Allander et al.,
have now identified a human bocavirus (HBoV) in the genus
_Bocavirus_. HBoV is most likely the 2nd known parvovirus species
pathogenic to humans.
The abstract of the Allander et al. paper reads: "The identification
of new virus species is a key issue for the study of infectious
disease but is technically very difficult. We developed a system for
large-scale molecular virus screening of clinical samples based on
host DNA depletion, random PCR amplification, large-scale sequencing,
and bioinformatics. The technology was applied to pooled human
respiratory tract samples. The 1st experiments detected 7 human virus
species without the use of any specific reagent. Among the detected
viruses were one coronavirus and one parvovirus, both of which were
at that time uncharacterized. The parvovirus, provisionally named
human bocavirus (HBoV), was in a retrospective clinical study
detected in 17 additional patients and associated with lower
respiratory tract infections in children. The molecular virus
screening procedure provides a general culture-independent solution
to the problem of detecting unknown virus species in single or pooled
samples. ****We suggest that a systematic."
The authors state further that confirming a causal relationship
between a virus and the observed symptoms is an important but
difficult issue that normally requires multiple separate studies to
be ultimately resolved. The classical Koch postulates cannot be
applied on most modern molecular discoveries, because fulfilling
Koch's postulates requires in vitro culture of the agent and access
to a suitable experimental animal model. The study of respiratory
tract disease is particularly difficult, because similar symptoms can
be produced by a wide range of agents, and respiratory tract samples
from healthy subjects or patients without respiratory symptoms are
rarely available. We addressed this issue by comparing 258 LRTI cases
with known etiology to 282 cases with unresolved etiology. HBoV was
primarily present in the subset of LRTI patients with unknown
etiology, and this nonrandom distribution suggests that HBoV is a
likely causative agent of LRTI.
Subsequent to publication of the Allander et al. paper, others have
found that HBoV is frequently found in nasopharyngeal samples of
hospitalized infants and children with acute respiratory tract
diseases. Proving the clinical relevance of HBoV is challenging,
because application of some of Koch's revised postulates is not
possible. Because of the high rate of coinfections with HBoV and
other respiratory tract pathogens, an association between HBoV and
respiratory tract diseases remains unproven.
For example, a Brisbane study (J Med Virol. 2006 Sep;78(9):1232-40)
made an additional 206 viral detections, resulting in the
identification of a virus in 67.0 percent of specimens. The majority
of the infectious agents were RNA viruses (89.9 percent). Overall,
human rhinoviruses (HRVs) were the most frequently identified target
(n = 140) followed by human adenoviruses (HAdVs; n = 25), human
metapneumovirus (HMPV; n = 18), human bocavirus (HBoV; n = 15), human
respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV; n = 12), human coronaviruses
(HCoVs; n = 11), and human herpesvirus-6 (n = 11). HRVs were the sole
agent detected in 37.8 percent (n = 31) of patients with suspected
lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Genotyping of the HRV
VP4/VP2 region resulted in a proposed subdivision of HRV type A into
sublineages A1 and A2. Most of the genotyped HAdV strains were found
to be type C. This study described the high microbial burden imposed
by HRVs, HMPV, HRSV, HCoVs, and the newly identified virus, HBoV on a
predominantly pediatric hospital population with suspected acute
respiratory tract infections.
The detection of bocavirus infection in China, therefore, is not
unexpected. - Mod.CP]
