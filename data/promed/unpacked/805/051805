Pool closed after danger bug scare
-----------------------------------
A swimming center has been closed after several pool users started
developing skin rashes. Fauldhouse Swimming Pool in West Lothian was shut
after complaints from members of the local Trojan Swimming Club.
Traces of the probable cause, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, were discovered in
initial tests at the council-run pool. Environmental health officials from
West Lothian Council ordered the closure of the pool in Lanrigg Road,
Fauldhouse, as a precautionary measure. Council officers are now carrying
out further tests, and the pool will remain closed until the results have
been received which give the pool the all-clear. That is expected to happen
tomorrow at the earliest.
The closure of the Fauldhouse pool is the latest bug scare to hit West
Lothian's swimming baths in recent years. Swimmers at Bubbles Leisure Pool
in Livingston contracted the potentially deadly _Cryptosporidium_ protozoan
in 2002.
Fauldhouse councillor Neil Findlay said he was satisfied that all the
necessary safety steps had been taken by the council. He said: "The
swimming pool has been closed as a precautionary measure. The pool manager
acted quickly and responsibly. Environmental health officers are carrying
out a thorough investigation and the pool will not reopen until the test
results are satisfactory. It is an unfortunate situation, particularly for
swimming clubs, but I am sure the people of Fauldhouse will understand that
public health must take priority."
_Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ is a bacterium which flourishes in warm, moist
areas, making pools and hot tubs an ideal environment for it. The
bacterium is capable of causing significant illnesses including skin
rashes, an ear infection commonly known as swimmer's ear, urinary tract
infections, pneumonia, and corneal ulcers. It is the most common bacteria
found in skin rashes and ear infections associated with recreational
waters. It is associated with skin infections involving a mild to
moderate red, itchy rash. These rashes are often mistaken for chicken pox.
A West Lothian Council spokesman said: "Initial results of tests carried
out on pool water indicate possible bacterial contamination. _Pseudomonas
aeruginosa_ can cause skin and ear infections. Anyone displaying these
symptoms after swimming should consult their GP. Further tests are being
carried out and the results are not expected until Fri, 2 Apr 2004. It is
hoped that these results will be clear and the pool will be open for the
weekend."

[Pseudomonas folliculitis (1) is a community-acquired skin infection
resulting from the bacterial infection of hair follicles following exposure
to contained, contaminated water, e.g., whirlpools (2), swimming pools (3
and as in this posting), hot tubs (3), and water slides (4). Initially
reported in the mid-1970s in association with whirlpool contamination, it
is caused by strains of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ acquired by skin
contamination of water containing the bacterium.
The rash has also been described in conjunction with the use of diving
suits (5) in both seawater and fresh water immersion, and even following
the use of contaminated bathing objects (such as a sponge) (6). Pseudomonas
folliculitis has occurred after skin depilation and without recognizable
exposure. Hot water, high pH (>7.8), and low chlorine level (<0.5 mg/L) all
predispose to infection.
This ubiquitous bacterium, _P. aeruginosa_, is found in soil and fresh
water and is able to obtain entry through hair follicles or via breaks in
the skin. Bacterial serotype O:11 is the most commonly reported isolate for
water-associated pseudomonas folliculitis, but other serotypes that have
been reported include O:1, O:3, O:4, O:6, O:7, O:9, O:10, and O:16.
The onset of this entity is usually 48 hours (range, 8 hrs to 5 days) after
exposure to contaminated water, but it has been reported to occur as long
as 14 days after exposure. Lesions begin as pruritic, erythematous macules
progressing to papules and pustules. The rash usually clears spontaneously
in 2-10 days and rarely recurs. It heals without scarring but may cause
desquamation or leave hyperpigmented macules.
Other symptoms that can occur with the rash include low-grade fever,
headache or malaise/fatigue. Otitis externa (swimmer's ear) may occur as
well. Breast tenderness in both women and men may also occur. The glands
of Montgomery on the nipple may become infected or overt mastitis may
develop. Named after William Fetherstone H. Montgomery, they are a group of
12-15 sebaceous glands in the areola of the nipple that produce small
prominences around the nipple of the breast that enlarge during pregnancy
and lactation, having the appearance of small seedlike tubercles. They were
previously described by Giovanni Battista Morgagni of _Morganella morgagni_
fame. In immunocompromised (particularly neutropenic) patients, lesions
can progress to ecthyma gangrenosum (7).
