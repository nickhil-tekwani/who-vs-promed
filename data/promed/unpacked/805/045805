Opossums have become a growing nuisance as they are found across the country in increasing numbers. The marsupials are commonly associated with rural America, but they are now calling big cities their home -- especially now, their breeding season. One opossum was recently found on a shelf in a Queens, New York, grocery store.

The onslaught of opossums is coming with a new danger: an outbreak of a type of typhus fever reported in California. Murine typhus causes severe flulike symptoms and can be transmitted by the fleas that opossums carry.

Inside Edition linked up with Jeremy Bailey of Animal Capture Wildlife Control when he responded to a call at a residence in Burbank. [Burbank, with a population of about 100 000 in 2010, is a city in Los Angeles County in southern California, USA, 12 miles (19 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burbank,_California).] "Because of the [murine] typhus outbreak, [if] they see an animal in the yard, they are terrified," he told Inside Edition.

He checked vents around the house for openings and explained the creatures will rip them open and live under the house. He set a trap and spread cat food to lure the animal in the homeowner's yard. The next day he checked on the trap and found an opossum inside. The homeowner told Inside Edition he was concerned by the fleas that the opossums bring in.

[Although worldwide rats are the main animal host and rat fleas are the usual vectors, cat fleas found on domestic and feral cats and opossums have been associated with cases of murine typhus in the USA (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27273642). Pathogens for murine typhus in south Texas and California include _Rickettsia typhi_ and possibly _Rickettsia felis_ that are found in cats and opossums and their fleas (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2737805/). See the webpage on murine typhus from the Los Angeles (LA) County Department of Health Services, Environmental Health Vector Management Program (http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/vet/docs/mtyphus.pdf).

There is an ongoing outbreak of murine typhus in LA County. As of our last post on the LA outbreak [Murine typhus - USA (09): (CA) Los Angeles County, more cases, RFI 20181013.6089681], there were 91 cases of murine typhus in LA County, including 9 cases in downtown LA and 32 cases in the LA County cities of Pasadena (20 cases) and Long Beach (12 cases).

Although 6 of the 9 cases in downtown LA are reported to be homeless individuals, we have not been told of the characteristics of the other 82 cases. News articles on this outbreak have mentioned the importance of flea protection for pets, but we have not been told of the frequency of exposure to companion animals among the cases of murine typhus. - Mod.ML
