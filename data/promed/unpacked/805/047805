A Dawson County woman is receiving treatment after being bitten by a rabid dog on 24 Jun 2016. County officials confirmed the rabies case on 29 Jun 2016, saying the public should not be alarmed as the dog in question has been euthanized. "The Georgia Public Health Laboratory tested brain tissue from the dog for the presence of the rabies virus," said Bill Ringle with the department of public health.

Two other dogs belonging to the same owner were also put down as a precaution, according to Dawson County Commission Chairman Mike Berg. "The 2 other dogs came back negative for rabies," he said. Ringle said the decision to euthanize the 2 dogs was made "because one had injuries from when it was attacked by the confirmed rabid dog, and the other dog had a leg injury that could not be accounted for."

None of the 3 dogs had been vaccinated for rabies, according to Ringle.

The woman, whose name and age were not released, was bitten by a tan-colored, mixed-breed on Burnt River Road, near Bailey Waters Road, northwest of Dawsonville. Ringle said health insurance law prevents the government from releasing the extent of her injuries.

"Since public health is not a primary health care provider for rabies treatment, we would not comment on injuries or treatment," he said. "Public health's role is to collect and submit the sample from the animal for testing, advise any human exposed to possible rabies to seek advice from their doctor, and to submit results of testing to the state public health office."

A 15-year-old male that reportedly touched the dog is also being evaluated for symptoms of the virus, according to Berg.

Dawson County animal control officers went door to door notifying neighbors within a one-mile radius of the bite that the dog had been confirmed to have rabies. "When a domestic animal is confirmed to have rabies, the protocol is to hand deliver a notice to every residence within a one-mile radius of the animal's home location," Ringle said. "We have also contacted each veterinarian office in Dawson County to make them aware of the situation."

Residents living on Grover Burt, Keith Evans, Robert Gibby, Old Henry Grady, Juno, Ivey, Reece, Mildred Elliott and Davenport roads, as well as Shamrock Lane and Tatum Trail that have outside roaming pets are urged to re-vaccinate immediately if they believe their animals may have been in contact with the rabid dog. "In such cases, consult with your veterinarian to inquire about a rabies vaccine booster. All unvaccinated animals that have been in contact with this animal should be euthanized or undergo isolated confinement for a period of 6 months," county officials said in a press release on Wednesday [29 Jun 2016] afternoon.

There are penalties for pet owners that do not vaccinate their dogs and cats. "Georgia state law requires that every dog or cat aged 3 months or older shall be vaccinated for rabies. The penalty is a misdemeanor," Ringle said.

This is the 2nd case of rabies in Dawson County this year [2016].

Ringle said a raccoon in the Amicalola Church and Steele Bridge roads area tested positive for the virus on 20 May 2016. There were 3 rabies cases involving one fox and 2 raccoons confirmed in 2015, he said.

For more information, or if you notice any domestic, stray or wild animals acting out of the ordinary, avoid contact with the animal and confine it, then call 9-1-1 or Dawson County Animal Control at (706) 265-7387.

[2] Raccoon, Polk County, Georgia

Two raccoons have tested positive for animal rabies, and public health officials are awaiting test results on a 3rd raccoon. Two of the 3 (one confirmed positive and the 2nd pending test results) were found in the College Street area in Cedartown, but officials emphasize animal rabies can be found throughout the county.

Tim Allee with Northwest Georgia Public Health said that in the 1st case of rabies found in a raccoon, a College Street resident was working in his yard when he was bitten. Though so far testing negative for rabies, Allee said the man was being treated as a precaution since he was exposed to rabies. "In the 2nd case, a few dogs in the area were exposed to it," Allee said.

Following those 2 cases, the 3rd raccoon was spotted in the area and seen to be acting erratically and taken by health officials. Test results in the 3rd case are expected no later than 11 Jul 2016.

These are the 1st confirmed animal rabies cases in Polk County for 2016. Polk County had one animal rabies case in 2015, 3 in 2014, none in 2013, 3 in 2012, 5 in 2011 and 8 in 2010.

"Reducing the risk of rabies in domestic animals and limiting human contact with wild animals are 2 measures central to the prevention of human rabies," explains Kathy Couey-Miller, Environmental Health Manager at the Polk County Health Department. "We're reminding residents to vaccinate all domestic animals, particularly dogs and cats, and to avoid exposure -- for themselves and their domestic pets -- to potentially rabid wildlife such as raccoons, foxes, skunks and bats."

Couey-Miller cautioned that wild, stray, and unvaccinated animals may be infected with rabies and emphasized that residents should take precautions to protect themselves, their families, and their pets. "Reducing the risk of rabies in domestic animals and limiting human contact with wild animals are 2 measures central to the prevention of human rabies," explained Couey-Miller.

Effective precautions against rabies include:
- Vaccinate all dogs, cats and ferrets against rabies. Check with your veterinarian to make sure your pets have up-to-date protection against rabies. Remember that the vaccination of pets against rabies protects not only the pets, but more importantly, protects people.
- Low-cost rabies vaccinations are available through Tractor Supply stores in Cartersville, Dallas, and Rome about every 2 weeks. Call for specific information.
- Don't leave pet food out where wild animals can access it. Leaving pet food out is a sure way of getting wild animals to visit your home endangering you, your family and your pets.
- Remind children to avoid animals they don't recognize, especially stray or wild animals. These animals may be infected with rabies.
- Small children should not be left unattended with dogs, even if the dog is a pet or the child is familiar with it.
- Keep pets at home. Obey any county laws requiring that dogs be restrained to the owner's property. Pets that are kept close to home are less likely to encounter a rabid animal.
- Report any raccoon, fox, bat or skunk that is out during the day in a residential area or that is behaving strangely to the local Georgia Department of Natural Resources Game and Fish Division office at 1-800-241-4113.
- Report stray dogs and cats and aggressive or sick-appearing animals to the local animal-control office.
- Don't attempt to assist injured or sick animals without professional help. Even animals which would never bite otherwise can bite when sick or in pain.
- Bats found in sleeping quarters should be captured and tested for rabies even when there is no evidence of a bite wound or contact with the sleeping individuals.
- After-hours calls involving aggressive animals should be directed to 911.
- After-hours calls involving animal bites and their potential for rabies exposure should be directed to 866-PUB-HLTH (866-782-4584).

Polk County residents can contact the Polk County Health Department's Environmental Health Office in Cedartown at 770-749-2253 for additional information or with any questions or concerns. Residents can also visit the Northwest Georgia Public Health website at http://www.nwgapublichealth.org/env/rabies.htm for county-specific animal rabies data for the 10-county Northwest Health District, which includes Polk County, as well as information on rabies precautions.

[Dawson County, Georgia, is in the far north of that state; see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawson_County,_Georgia.
Polk County is in NW Georgia on the border with Alabama; see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polk_County,_Georgia.
The Connecticut report contains a fair map of the state showing the location.

The key to controlling urban rabies is to make sure that domestic dogs and cats are routinely vaccinated whether it is compulsory or not. In rural areas, the same applies, but also ensure your horses are vaccinated. They are worth the expense as are pedigree stock. - Mod.MHJ
