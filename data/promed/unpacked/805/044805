A cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe has killed 775 people with 16 141 suspected
cases reported across the African nation, according to new World Health
Organization data released on Wednesday [10 Dec 2008].

"Approximately half of cases have been recorded in Budiriro, a heavily
populated suburb on the western outskirts of the capital, Harare," said
WHO. Other badly hit areas include Beitbridge, which borders South Africa
and Mudzi, which borders Mozambique, it added.

Earlier, the UN humanitarian affairs bureau said the death toll had reached
746, with 15 572 suspected cases reported.

The capital Harare is the worst-affected district with 189 deaths and 7653
suspected cases recorded as of 9 Dec 2008, the UN Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement.

The number of Musina cholera cases has risen to 664 overnight, the Limpopo
health department said on Wednesday [10 Dec 2008]. The number had risen
from 645.

Spokesperson Phuthi Seloba said although there was a rise in suspected
cases from the previous day, the death toll remained at 8. The increase
comes after Health Minister Barbara Hogan led a team of health experts to
assess the cholera outbreak in Limpopo on Tuesday [9 Dec 2008].

The outbreak began on 15 Nov 2008 after Zimbabweans affected by the disease
in their country crossed the border to seek treatment from the South
African province.

Cholera has broken out in Nameembo area of Mazabuka district with several
villagers reportedly admitted to a cholera center. Mazabuka District
Commissioner Tyson Hamaamba, who disclosed this to ZANIS in Mazabuka today
[10 Dec 2008], said the situation was serious and called for concerted
efforts in containing the outbreak.

The district commissioner, who has attributed the disease outbreak to the
dirty and untreated water residents were fetching from contaminated shallow
wells urged villagers to boil or chlorinate drinking water to prevent the
disease from spreading.

Two months ago, 2 people died of cholera in the Nameembo area.

At least 4 people have died from 20 cases of cholera reported in
Mozambique's Mossurize district on the border with Zimbabwe since 4 Dec
2008, the daily Noticias reported on Wednesday [10 Dec 2008]. It cited
Vasco David Gaspar, Mossurize district administrator.

Gaspar added that the other 16 people were detained at a local health
center in Macuo village, which is 10 km from Chipinge.

The reports of the infections came a day after health minister Ivo Garrido
told reporters in Maputo on Tuesday [9 Dec 2008] that there were no
confirmed cases of cholera in the east African country related to the
recent outbreak in neighboring Zimbabwe.

[5] Cholera - Mozambique
Date: Wed 10 Dec 2008

I have just returned from Mozambique. I went on a trip with the Canadian
Foodgrains Bank. We were in the Changara district south west of Tete.

When we arrived, we were told there were only 2 cases of cholera in the
area. But we found out that at Mandea, more than 40 people had died, and in
the Dzumga, 9 people had died, and there were about 45 people being treated
at the hospital. The food shipment for November 2008 had not arrived when
we were there on 27 Nov 2008.

The rainy season usually begins in October. It hadn't rained there since
September 2008. We asked the district administrator at Changara why he had
not asked for disaster assistance. He said "I don't want my area to look bad."

We checked some of the UNICEF water wells. The pumps are broken in the
Changara area. Do we know anyone with UNICEF who can get the pumps fixed?
People were drinking from the same waterhole as the animals.

I find it very distressing that this situation has not been reported. We
were in the airport in Johannesburg, and we met a man who said he was with
the US Centers for Disease Control [and Prevention], and we told him what
we had seen and had been told. He was on the phone immediately afterwards.

[ProMED-mail thanks Sylvia MacBean for this firsthand report.

The proximity of Tete province to the Shire valley of Malawi suggests that
cholera might have reached further east than Tete. And if Changara is
anything to go by, cholera may be being seen in other Mozambique towns on
rivers draining out of Zimbabwe, such as Chicualacuala and towns on the
Save river. - - Mod.MHJ

The Tete province is north of Manica in south western Mozambique. As can be
seen on a map, it also borders Zimbabwe, but it is not known whether the
cases are related to the large outbreak in Zimbabwe; see

An outbreak of cholera in the riverine community of Kula in Nigeria's
Rivers state killed 10 people, a health official said.

"We have already dispatched a medical team to the area with the necessary
drugs and materials to curtail the spread of the disease," Dr Samson
Parker, Rivers State's commissioner for health, said in an interview in
Port Harcourt. Residents have been told to boil water for drinking until
other arrangements can be made, he said.

The Office of Hygiene and Epidemiology of Guinea Bissau says the cholera
epidemic affecting Guinea Bissau has spread and turned further lethal.

Reports on the 1st week of December 2008 talk of 21 cases and 2 deaths,
raising fatalities to 224 and the affected to 14 201, and Bissau stands out
as the most affected with 73 deaths and 9378 patients.

The outbreak began last May 2008 in the south, and in July 2008, the
authorities declared the epidemic out of control, reporting a drop in
November 2008 when the rains in West Africa held up.

[8] Cholera, refugees - Uganda (Kanungu)

A cholera outbreak in the newly-created Matanda Refugee Camp in Kihiihi
Sub-county, Kanungu District has killed 2 people and affected more than a
dozen others, raising fears that it could spread to the residents.

The UNHCR spokesperson at the camp, Ms Yumco Takashima, said they were
battling the disease and had already isolated some people to curb the
spread of the disease. "We were prepared to handle this situation, and we
alerted our partners like the Red Cross to be on standby so that if any
epidemic breaks out, we can control it," Ms Takashima said.

In November 2008, 2 refugees died of cholera at Nakivale camp. Meanwhile,
over 700 refugees have returned to Congo in the last 3 days following
decreased fighting. The Kanungu District Police commander, Mr Nazario
Mugisha, said more refugees are demanding to go back, but security has been
advising them to be patient.

Over 70 000 refugees reportedly crossed into Uganda following the battle
between Laurent Nkunda's rebels and the government forces.
