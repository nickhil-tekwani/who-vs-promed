"The zoonotic avian influenza viruses that have been detected in China (H7N9 and H5N6) and parts of Africa and Asia (H5N1), pose the most significant public health risks. Veterinary authorities have struggled to control the situation, which has allowed these viruses to continue to circulate in poultry populations. This creates the risk of reassortment from coinfections of different influenza viruses, and public health risks through exposure of people to avian influenza viruses during rearing and slaughter. Although there are seasonal trends, the risk is year round since the viruses have become established and self-sustaining in bird populations. The role of commercially farmed poultry, backyard poultry, live bird marketing systems, and wild birds of differing species in maintenance of the virus and transmission will have a local context that needs to be understood through epidemiological study".

"Since 2014 and through 17 Nov 2018, 22 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported globally and all have occurred in mainland China. The latest case was reported on 31 Oct 2018." See more details at, https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/2018_avian_influenza_report_vol14_wk46.pdf.

In addition to the 22 human cases indicated above, on 23 Nov 2018 a new human case of avian influenza H5N6 involving a 10-year-old girl was reported from Suzhou in Jiangsu. See https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201811/23/P2018112300411.htm and ProMED-mail posting 20181126.6164407. - Mod.CRD]
