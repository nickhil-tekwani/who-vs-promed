A 4-year old retired thoroughbred racehorse had a serum sample collected on
21 Feb 2000 for piroplasmosis pre-export testing for Australia. The sample
was reported on 28 Feb 2000 by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA),
Weybridge, UK to be SUSPICIOUS by the Complement Fixation Test (CFT) and
POSITIVE 1+ at a Titre of 320 by the Indirect Immunofluorescence Antibody
Test (IFAT) to _Babesia equi_ and NEGATIVE on both tests to _Babesia
caballi_.
Six other retired racehorses in the export batch were reported as all
NEGATIVE by CFT at 1/5 for both _B.equi_ and _B.caballi_. Regrettably, due
to an oversight, the IFAT POSITIVE horse was inadvertently authorized to
travel on 7 Mar 2000 and was euthanized in post-arrival quarantine in
Melbourne on 23 March. All 7 horses were re-tested in post-arrival
quarantine in Australia for _B.equi_ by IFAT. The seropositive horse
remained POSITIVE whilst the 6 in-contact horses were NEGATIVE.
The seropositive horse was imported into Hong Kong on 27 Jan 1999 directly
from the Republic of South Africa under the European Union equine health
protocols and with additional certification for Hong Kong which included
testing for piroplasmosis. The horse had a NEGATIVE CFT for both _B.equi_
and _B.caballi_ on a serum sample collected on 4 Jan 1999 which was tested
at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories, Ames, Iowa, USA.
Neither the seropositive horse, nor any other equine in Hong Kong, has ever
shown any clinical signs of piroplasmosis and over 180 export tests over
the past 3 years for this disease have been NEGATIVE except for 3 POSITIVE
CFT which were NEGATIVE on IFAT.
All 1,562 equines in the territory, consisting of 1058 racehorses in
training at Sha Tin Racecourse, 21 retired racehorses at Sha Tin awaiting
export or relocation and 483 retired racehorses/hacks/ponies in 9 riding
schools, have had serum samples collected between 14 and 20 Mar 2000, which
will be tested for antibodies to _B.equi_ and _B.caballi_ by the IFAT.
In addition all horses that had ever shared the same stable unit with the
seropositive horse have been traced. All serum samples which were obtained
and stored from these horses prior to them leaving the Hong Kong population
will be also be tested.
Results of tests performed at the VLA on 17 March 2000 on 3 stored serum
samples from the seropositive horse show it has been seropositive since
its arrival in Hong Kong despite its NEGATIVE pre-import CFT. Samples
collected on 28 Jan 1999, i.e. the day after his arrival in Hong Kong (a
routine practice for all imported horses), 4 February 1999 and 12 May 1999
were all POSITIVE at 1/5 by CFT to _B.equi_ and POSITIVE 1+ at a Titre of
640 by IFAT. _B.caballi_ was always NEGATIVE.
Twenty-six stored serum samples (including immediate post-arrival samples)
of the only 5 other South African horses ever permanently imported into
Hong Kong collected at various intervals were all found, when tested as
well on 17 March, to be NEGATIVE to both _B.equi_ and _B.caballi_ on IFAT.
Of this group of 5 horses, the results fluctuated between SUSPICIOUS,
POSITIVE and NEGATIVE to CFT in different samples. One horse which was
sampled on 13 different occasions was CFT SUSPICIOUS for both _B.equi_ (8
samples) and _B.caballi_ (4 samples) and POSITIVE @ 1/5 for B.equi (2
samples) and NEGATIVE for both (3 samples) between 6 and 8 months after the
last POSITIVE result. Another 2 horses were SUSPICIOUS for _B.equi_ and
_B.caballi_. Another horse was SUSPICIOUS for _B.equi_ and 1 horse showed
no reactions to any test.
Ninety-two results received from the VLA of 96 horses and ponies from the
sampling performed between 14 and 20 March, reported _B.equi_ and
_B.caballi_ NEGATIVE to CFT and 4 _B.equi_ SUSPICIOUS which were NEGATIVE
to IFAT. All NEGATIVE CFT's will be repeated by IFAT in due course.
Ticks are found extremely rarely on horses in Hong Kong and all 1562
equines in the territory have, between 16 and 18 Mar 2000, been
systematically and thoroughly inspected for the presence of ticks and NONE
have been found.
A tick survey of all equine premises and facilities in Hong Kong has been
initiated.
The Hong Kong Jockey Club's Veterinary Department is solely responsible for
the treatment of all equines in Hong Kong and new needles and syringes are
used on every occasion.
The opportunity for natural or iatrogenic spread of the disease is
therefore considered to be extremely low.
With effect 16 Mar 2000, all horses either permanently or temporarily
imported into Hong Kong must be tested for equine piroplasmosis using the
Indirect Immunofluorescence Antibody Test (IFAT) with a NEGATIVE result
within 10 days of export. Countries that can certify freedom from equine
piroplasmosis (equine babesiosis) and have import controls to prevent the
introduction of seropositive horses may be exempted from this requirement.
In view of this report, it would appear that the CFT is an insufficiently
reliable test for this purpose.
In addition, all equines imported into Hong Kong irrespective of their
origins must be treated with an approved insecticide within 24 hours of
travel.
Further information will be disseminated as it becomes available.
