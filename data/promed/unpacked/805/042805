Safety and immunogenicity of an rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine in two formulations: two open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies from Russia. Lancet. Epub 4 Sep 2020. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31866-3

Summary
------
Background: We developed a heterologous COVID-19 vaccine consisting of 2 components, a recombinant adenovirus type 26 (rAd26) vector and a recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) vector, both carrying the gene for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein (rAd26-S and rAd5-S). We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of 2 formulations (frozen and lyophilised) of this vaccine.

Methods: We did 2 open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies at 2 hospitals in Russia. We enrolled healthy adult volunteers (men and women) aged 18-60 years to both studies. In phase 1 of each study, we administered intramuscularly on day 0 either one dose of rAd26-S or one dose of rAd5-S and assessed the safety of the 2 components for 28 days. In phase 2 of the study, which began no earlier than 5 days after phase 1 vaccination, we administered intramuscularly a prime-boost vaccination, with rAd26-S given on day 0 and rAd5-S on day 21. Primary outcome measures were antigen-specific humoral immunity (SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies measured by ELISA on days 0, 14, 21, 28, and 42) and safety (number of participants with adverse events monitored throughout the study). Secondary outcome measures were antigen-specific cellular immunity (T-cell responses and interferon-gamma concentration) and change in neutralising antibodies (detected with a SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay). These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04436471 and NCT04437875.

Findings: Between 18 Jun 2020 and 3 Aug 2020, we enrolled 76 participants to the 2 studies (38 in each study). In each study, 9 volunteers received rAd26-S in phase 1, 9 received rAd5-S in phase 1, and 20 received rAd26-S and rAd5-S in phase 2. Both vaccine formulations were safe and well tolerated. The most common adverse events were pain at injection site (44 [58%]), hyperthermia (38 [50%]), headache (32 [42%]), asthenia (21 [28%]), and muscle and joint pain (18 [24%]). Most adverse events were mild, and no serious adverse events were detected. All participants produced antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein. At day 42, receptor binding domain-specific IgG titres were 14 703 with the frozen formulation and 11 143 with the lyophilised formulation, and neutralising antibodies were 49.25 with the frozen formulation and 45.95 with the lyophilised formulation, with a seroconversion rate of 100%. Cell-mediated responses were detected in all participants at day 28, with median cell proliferation of 2.5% CD4+ and 1.3% CD8+ with the frozen formulation, and a median cell proliferation of 1.3% CD4+ and 1.1% CD8+ with the lyophilised formulation.

Interpretation: The heterologous rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based COVID-19 vaccine has a good safety profile and induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses in participants. Further investigation is needed of the effectiveness of this vaccine for prevention of COVID-19.

[This reports the much-awaited clinical trial data on the Russian vaccine (see COVID-19 update (384): vaccine trials, USA 2nd inf comment, WHO, global 20200901.7733788). The sample size has been criticized as small and non-randomly selected, and efficacy was not studied in a larger group. That said, the paper has been praised for the rigorous scientific work that was conducted.

A race is on between the USA, China and Russia for who can produce the 1st vaccine, with many concerns raised among the vaccinology community on the feasibility of producing a safe vaccine in a short period of time. Only time will tell. Mod.LK's comment in update (384) is highly recommended. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Vaping as a risk factor for COVID-19
Date: Fri 4 Sep 2020
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/health/covid-vaping-smoking.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article


Researchers are starting to home in on the ways in which the use of e-cigarettes raises the chances of catching the virus, and suffering its worst effects.

Twenty-year-old [JM] vaped his 1st pen a year ago [2019]. By late fall, he was blowing through several THC-laced cartridges a week -- more, he said, than most people can handle. Then in early December 2019, he found himself in the emergency room of Sharp Grossmont Hospital in San Diego with a collapsed lung and a diagnosis of vaping-related lung illness. His hospital stay plunged him into a medically induced coma, forced him onto a breathing machine and stripped nearly 50 pounds off his 6-foot-1-inch frame in just 2 weeks. At one point, [JM] said, his doctors gave him a 5% chance of survival. He resolved that the wax pen he had vaped before his hospitalization would be his last.

When he contracted a mild case of COVID-19 during a family barbecue 3 months ago, he knew he had quit not a moment too soon. "If I had caught COVID-19 within the week before I got really ill, I probably would have died," he said.

Since the start of the pandemic, experts have warned that the coronavirus -- a respiratory pathogen -- most likely capitalizes on the scarred lungs of smokers and vapers. Doctors and researchers are now starting to pinpoint the ways in which smoking and vaping seem to enhance the virus's ability to spread from person to person, infiltrate the lungs and spark some of COVID-19's worst symptoms.

"I have no doubt in saying that smoking and vaping could put people at increased risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19," said Dr. Stephanie Lovinsky-Desir, a pediatric pulmonologist at Columbia University. "It is quite clear that smoking and vaping are bad for the lungs, and the predominant symptoms of COVID are respiratory. Those 2 things are going to be bad in combination."

Last year's [2019] vaping crisis, during which thousands of people like [JM] were sickened and hospitalized with severe lung and respiratory illnesses, underscored the hazards of many e-cigarette and vaping products, especially illicitly sold marijuana-based vapes. But while several studies have found that smoking can more than double a person's risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms, the data on the relationship between vaping and COVID-19 are only beginning to emerge. A team of researchers recently reported that young adults who vape are 5 times more likely to receive a coronavirus diagnosis.

Much of what underlies the relationship between smoking, vaping and the coronavirus remains unclear. Doctors aren't sure why vaping makes some people seriously sick but seems to spare others. And [JM's] unexpectedly mild encounter with the coronavirus remains mysterious as well. These and other lingering questions have made the risks of smoking and vaping during the pandemic tough to communicate.

[JI], a 26-year-old Army veteran who lives in Hingham, Mass., has been hooked on vaping nicotine for about 6 years. "I vape every day, all day long," [JI] said. The looming threat of the virus doesn't intimidate him. "I hate to say it, but if I got the virus, I would still be vaping -- I wouldn't even think it was related," he said. Such stubbornness troubles experts, who pointed out that COVID is hardly the 1st disease to hit smokers and vapers harder.

"Lungs aren't designed to regularly breathe in smoke and vape," said Dr. Drew Harris, a pulmonologist at UVA Health in Virginia. These products, he added, "do just about everything bad you can think of." About 34 million adults smoke cigarettes in the USA, many of them from communities of color and low socioeconomic status -- groups already known to be more vulnerable to the virus. And more than 5 million middle and high school students recently reported using vapes.

Dr. Lovinsky-Desir describes the internal architecture of these tissues as bunches of gas-filled grapes, enmeshed in a network of blood vessels. "Chronic smoking destroys those grapes," she said. "They become saggy and floppy." Smoke can also compromise little hairlike structures known as cilia that boot toxins and microbes out of the airways, making it easier for pathogens to set up shop in the lungs. Should a virus then enter the mix, Dr. Lovinsky-Desir said, "it will cause more destruction," clogging the already damaged grapes with a glut of cellular debris. Years of data have borne out these relationships. Smokers who catch the flu, for instance, are more likely than nonsmokers to wind up in the hospital.

Less is known about vaping, a relative newcomer. But similar trends have been noted for e-cigarettes and vape pens. Several studies have shown that vaping makes mice more vulnerable to bacteria and viruses, and sends surges of inflammation throughout the body, beyond the boundaries of the lungs.

[JM] was one of thousands who last year [2019] fell prey to a disease called e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury, or EVALI. Many EVALI patients had vaped products containing a sticky substance called vitamin E acetate, which has been found in the branded Dr. Zodiak cartridges [JM] preferred.

After peaking last September [2019], emergency department visits linked to EVALI plummeted. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not updated their counts since February [2020], leaving experts worried that concerns over vaping have fallen to the wayside. "This has not gone away from patients," said Michelle Eakin, a pulmonary disease expert at Johns Hopkins University.

Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander noted that she and other researchers have struggled to follow up on many of last year's EVALI cases, paradoxically thanks to a pandemic that might hit some of these patients especially hard. Early evidence hints that the virus may have an easier time breaking into the bodies of smokers and vapers. Smoking appears to alter the surfaces of certain cells, prompting them to coat themselves with more of a molecule called ACE-2 -- the protein the coronavirus uses to break into its targets. "If you have higher expression, you're going to have more virus entering cells," Dr. Crotty Alexander said. "I'm now seeing the same sort of data come out on the vaping side."

That pattern, layered on top of the ways in which vaping weakens the lungs, may help explain why a recent survey of more than 4000 people ages 13 to 24 found that vaping was strongly linked to catching the coronavirus. But Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, a pediatrics researcher at Stanford University and an author on the study, said that there was probably more than biology at play. People who vape often do it socially, sharing spaces and equipment. And vaping, like smoking, involves a lot of hand-to-mouth movement, providing germs an easy path into the airway, Dr. Eakin said. "And if you're smoking or vaping," she said, "you're not wearing a mask."

Still unclear are the long-term consequences of COVID's effects on those who smoked or vaped. Accumulating evidence suggests that the coronavirus can wreak havoc on blood vessels, seeding clots that suffocate and warp tissues, including the lungs -- most likely making any smoking or vaping after COVID even more dangerous than before. "Some of these patients will have permanent issues," said Dr. Anne Melzer, a pulmonologist at the University of Minnesota.

[This is not a surprising finding. In 2019 there were reports of severe lung disease associated with use of e-cigarettes, with a higher risk of those vaping THC containing artisanal products. Gaiha and co-authors studied use of e-cigarettes and use of both e-cigarettes and regular cigarettes and found COVID-19 diagnosis was 5 times more likely among those who had ever used e-cigarettes and 7 times more likely among those who use both e-cigarettes and regular cigarettes.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory for 4 Sep 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesSept4_1599259914.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 45.1% of daily case numbers and 63.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 13.7 million cases. Brazil and the USA are dominant followed by Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico.

- The European region reported 14.8% of daily case numbers and 7.6% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 4.3 million. Spain is dominant followed by France, Russia, Israel, and Ukraine.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.1% of daily case numbers and 5.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 1.9 million cases. Iraq remains the dominant country, followed by Iran, Morocco, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia.

- The African region reported 2.1% of daily case numbers and 1.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and have reported more than one million cases. While South Africa remains the dominant country, the numbers have been lower than in previous days and weeks, followed by Ethiopia, Algeria, Ghana, Namibia, and Kenya.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 1.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.5 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 32.6% of the daily newly reported cases and 19.0% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.4 million cases. India continues to dominate followed by Indonesia and Bangladesh.

Basically the same: Europe, while experiencing resurgences in many countries related to loosening restrictions and the summer vacation period, is overshadowed by the major transmission ongoing in South East Asia -- specifically India.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 4 Sep 2020, is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic. - Mod.MPP]

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (87 115), followed by the USA (53 813) and Brazil (45 651) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.1%) and 58.7% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 5602 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (3-4 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Spain (28 620), Argentina (10 684), France (8975), Colombia (8488), Mexico (6196), Russia (5110) and Iraq (5036), and 29 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 4.3%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 2.4%.

Impression: Unchanged from recent days. The European region is seeing increasing cases in western European countries that had markedly reduced transmission in late spring. The report of over 28 000 cases in the past 24 hours in Spain is eyebrow raising and may reflect slow reporting during the week. The most severely affected region remains the Americas. - Mod.MPP]
