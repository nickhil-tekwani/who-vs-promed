The hot summer and the failure of the resolution of the ICA
[Colombian Agriculture and Livestock Institute] on procedures for the
renewal of coffee plantations are causing an increase in field
infestation levels of the pest known as the coffee berry borer, said
Luis Fernando Caicedo Lince, manager of the ICA.

With regard to coffee rust, the aftermath of the last winter
[2008/2009], coupled with poor fertilization, caused a serious
deterioration of coffee plantations with varieties susceptible to
this fungus in some areas such as Caldas, Tolima and Antioquia.

The [national] rust control is based on the renovation of coffee
plantations to the variety Castillo, disease resistance and suitable
crop fertilization. "This is the main recommendation for producers
with lots affected by rust," said Caicedo Lince.

There are programs for small coffee growers for the renewal of their
plantings, which include payment of 100 percent of loan interest by
the National Coffee Fund.

[Coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) is caused by the
fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_, one of the most feared pathogens of the
crop. Of the 2 coffee species grown commercially, _Coffea arabica_
(arabica or highland coffee) and _Coffea canephora_ (robusta or
lowland coffee), it affects only the former. It has destroyed arabica
plantings in many countries. The disease is characterised by
yellow-orange powdery lesions on the underside of leaves, where it
attacks through stomata; it rarely occurs on stems or fruit. Spores
are spread by wind and rain.

Disease management relies mainly on multiple fungicide applications
during the rainy season. Rust-resistant cultivars exist, but the crop
is generally of poorer quality. More than 30 races of the fungus have
been detected, making it particularly difficult to establish durable
host resistance.

In Colombia, CLR outbreaks were reported earlier in 2009 from Tolima
and Caldas, but from the item above, the disease appears to be even
more widespread. It has been reported that severe outbreaks were last
seen in the country over 25 years ago, and the possibility of an
emerging new, more aggressive fungal strain is being considered.

The coffee berry borer (_Hypothenemus hampei_) is one of the most
devastating pests of the crop. Adult females bore a hole in coffee
berries to lay their eggs.
