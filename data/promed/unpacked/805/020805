Novel coronavirus infection - update
-----------------
As of [25 Sep 2012], no additional cases of acute respiratory syndrome with renal failure due to infection with a novel coronavirus have been reported to WHO. WHO is continuing investigations into 2 recently confirmed infections identified as a novel coronavirus. Today WHO issued an interim case definition to help countries strengthen health protection measures against the new virus.

The case definition, based on the cases so far, includes criteria for identifying a 'patient under investigation', a 'probable case' and a 'confirmed case'. These criteria are based on clinical, epidemiological and laboratory indicators.

Following the confirmation of the novel coronavirus, WHO - under the International Health Regulations - immediately alerted all its Member States about the virus and has been leading the coordination and providing guidance to health authorities and technical health agencies. WHO is also identifying a network of laboratories that can provide expertise on coronaviruses for countries.

On [22 Sep 2012], the United Kingdom (UK) informed WHO of a case of acute respiratory syndrome with travel history to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and Qatar.

The case is a previously healthy, 49 year-old male Qatari national that presented with symptoms on [3 Sep 2012] with travel history to KSA several days prior to onset of illness. On [7 Sep 2012] he was admitted to an intensive care unit in Doha, Qatar. On [11 Sep 2012], he was transferred to the UK by air ambulance from Qatar. The Health Protection Agency of the UK (HPA) conducted laboratory testing and subsequently confirmed the presence of the novel coronavirus.

The HPA compared the sequencing of the virus isolate from the 49 year-old Qatari national with that of a virus sequenced previously by the Erasmus University Medical Centre, Netherlands. This latter isolate was obtained from lung tissue of a fatal case earlier this year in a 60 year-old Saudi national. This comparison indicated 99.5 percent identity, with one nucleotide mismatch over the regions compared.

Though it is a very different virus to SARS, given the severity of the 2 confirmed cases so far, WHO is engaged in further characterizing the novel coronavirus. As such, international efforts are being stepped up across all WHO 6 regions to ensure an appropriate and effective response with a WHO specialist team in daily contact with more than a dozen international and regional technical partners.

In addition WHO is working closely with KSA, as in previous years, to support the country's health measures for all visitors participating in the Haji pilgrimage to Mecca next month [October 2012].

not explained by any other infection or any other aetiology.

AND

Epidemiological criteria:
Close contact* within the last 10 days before onset of illness
- with a probable or confirmed case of novel coronavirus infection while the case-contact was ill
OR

Probable Novel Coronavirus Case:

A person fitting the clinical definition AND epidemiological criteria above but no laboratory confirmation.

Confirmed Novel Coronavirus Case:

A person with laboratory confirmation of infection with the novel coronavirus.


* Close contact is defined as:
- Anyone who provided care for a confirmed or probable case including HCW and family members in a health care setting or in the community.
- Anyone who stayed at the same place (e.g. lived with, visited) as a probable or confirmed case while they have been symptomatic.
- Anyone with significant casual exposure with the patient such as sitting nearby in a classroom, sharing a taxi, sitting close by on an airplane.

** Area where infection with novel coronavirus where transmission could have occurred:
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar (as of [25 Sep 2012])

UK agency picks name for new coronavirus isolate
----------------
As the investigation of 2 severe illnesses associated with a novel coronavirus continued today, the United Kingdom's Health Protection Agency (HPA) released a preliminary phylogenetic tree for the virus and tentatively named it "London1_novel CoV 2012."

As reported previously, the virus has been identified in a 49-year-old Qatari man who is in a critical care unit in a London hospital and in a 60-year-old Saudi Arabian man who died in July [2012] in his home country. Both cases involve pneumonia and kidney failure, and the Qatari man had traveled to Saudi Arabia before he got sick.

In 2003, a then-novel coronavirus caused the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak, which killed 774 people worldwide. Other coronaviruses are linked to the common cold.

The phylogenetic tree, constructed from partial sequences from the polymerase gene of various coronaviruses, shows that the new one is closely related to bat coronaviruses. The HPA also released the partial sequence for the virus's polymerase gene.

In other developments, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said today the available information suggests that the current risk associated with the new virus is low.

Noting that there has been no sign of human-to-human transmission, the agency said, "The newly identified coronavirus is not genetically similar to the SARS coronavirus and does not signal the start of a new SARS outbreak."

Also today, the World Health Organization (WHO) commented via Twitter that the kidney failure reported in both patients infected with the new virus is a "unique feature" of the infection.

In addition, late today the WHO released an update and an interim case definition to help countries be on guard against the new virus. On the basis of the cases so far, the definition includes criteria for "a patient under investigation," a probable case, and a confirmed case, using clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory variables. The update said no new cases were identified today.

And in Hong Kong, the region's Hospital Authority said that a previously reported cluster of coronavirus-related respiratory illnesses in Castle Peak Hospital was caused by a known coronavirus. The cases occurred in a "female long-stay ward" and are due to human coronavirus NL63, a strain that usually causes mild respiratory illness such as the common cold, the agency said in a statement.

[The WHO update and preliminary case definitions presented in parts [1] and [2] are indicative of the activities being launched to increase the probability of early identification of potential additional cases of severe respiratory disease associated with renal failure attributable to this novel coronavirus. An example of the impact of this is an additional newswire from Xinhua news mentioning there are 5 individuals in a Danish hospital "currently being examined for symptoms of infection from a new coronavirus" (see http://english.cri.cn/6966/2012/09/26/2701s724277.htm). From the information provided (or not provided) in this newswire, these 5 patients would most likely be categorized as "patients under investigation".

Given the inclusion of the category "patient under investigation" this moderator suspects that there will be many reports of patients under investigation" in the coming days (and weeks) -- a positive sign of increased surveillance activities attempting to identify potential geographic spread.

There is obvious concern of the potential for a similar type outbreak as seen in 2002/2003 with SARS. The global international public health network and response environment is significantly different in 2012 than it was in 2002/2003 during the SARS epidemic. Disease surveillance is improved, with greater transparency in reporting at all levels, including the active participation of non-traditional sources of information such as the media. And equally important is the recognition of the need for respiratory isolation early on so that "patients under investigation" are now subjected to respiratory isolation. As a reminder, during the SARS epidemic, there was nosocomial enhancement of virus transmission -- "super spreaders" were in hospital environments where they were shedding virus freely in open areas and to health care workers and other patients in the hospital environment. (see Severe acute respiratory syndrome--Singapore, 2003.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2003 May 9;52(18):405-11 available at: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5218a1.htm).

In the CIDRAP news release there is mention of a proposed nomenclature for the new virus "London1_novel CoV 2012". The phylogenetic tree is presented in the HPA report (http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/RespiratoryViruses/NovelCoronavirus/respPartialgeneticsequenceofnovelcoronavirus/>.
For the interactive HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia and Qatar (the location of probable infection of both confirmed cases to date), see http://healthmap.org/r/1HAJ - Mod.MPP]

[The phylogenetic tree has been constructed with partial sequences from the polymerase gene (nsp12) of representative coronaviruses. The sequence obtained by the HPA has been tentatively named as London1_novel CoV 2012. The HPA sequence data are based on direct detection from clinical material from the London case. The HPA does not yet have a virus isolate. There will shortly be a GENBANK accession number for the sequence. The phylogenetic tree is considered preliminary, as is the virus nomenclature, and liable to change as more information or a virus isolate becomes available. - Mod.CP
