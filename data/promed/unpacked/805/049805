An outbreak of cholera has been confirmed in Maputo City. The first cases
were diagnosed on 13 August and 49 cases have been reported to date.
Prevention activities are already in place in the affected areas of the city
based on community health education and improvement of water supply services
and sanitation. The National Cholera Commission has been reactivated. A
special ward for the treatment of cases has been set up in Maputo Central
Hospital. WHO is giving technical and financial support to the Ministry of
Health for the implementation of these activities. No cholera cases [had]
occurred in Mozambique since mid-1994.
