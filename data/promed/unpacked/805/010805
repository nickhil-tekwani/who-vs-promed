PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2007 (03)
******************************
A ProMED-mail post

ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases
<http://www.isid.org>
[Note: With continuing decline of the number of cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease [abbreviated previously as vCJD or CJD (new
var.) in ProMED-mail] in the human population, it has been decided to
broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail reports to include
other prion-related diseases. These updates supersede the previous
update thread.
The definitions of the designations deaths, definite cases, probable
vCJD cases can be found by accessing the Department of Health website
<http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/index.htm>
or by reference to a previous ProMED-mail post in the vCJD thread.
Data on vCJD cases from any part of the world are now included in
these updates where appropriate, and other forms of CJD (sporadic,
iatrogenic, familial, and GSS Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease)
are included also when they have some relevance to the incidence and
etiology of vCJD.
In addition, prion-related diseases of domesticated and free-living
animals may also be included if relevant. - Mod.CP]

Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics - 2 Jul 2007
-----------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today [Mon 2 Jul 2007] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (CJD). This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the
form of the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK as of Mon 2 Jul 2007
--------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases -- deaths
-------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 114
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 47
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 161
Summary of vCJD cases - alive
------------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 4
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 165
(The next table will be published on Mon 6 Aug 2007.)
Since the previous monthly statistics were released on 4 Jun 2007,
the total number of deaths from definite vCJD remains 161. The number
of probable vCJD cases still alive is unchanged at 4, and the overall
total number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive)
remains 165.
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the
UK is in decline. The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000,
followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005,
5 in 2006, and so far 3 in 2007.
Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK since 1995
-----------------------------------------------
As of Mon 2 Jul 2007, in the UK in the year 2007, so far there have
been 55 referrals, 14 deaths from sporadic CJD, 2 deaths from
iatrogenic CJD, 3 deaths from vCJD, one from GSS and none from
familial CJD.
During the period from 1995, when vCJD was 1st diagnosed, up to the
present, there have been 981 deaths from all forms of CJD, including
the 161 deaths attributable to definite or probable vCJD. [These data

[2] UK: SEAC position statement on dentistry
Date: Sat 30 Jun 2007

Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) Update, June 2007 [edited]
<http://www.seac.gov.uk/statements/state-vcjd-dentrstry.htm>

Position Statement vCJD and Dentistry
-------------------------------------
Issue
-----
1. The Department of Health (DH) asked SEAC to advise on the findings
of preliminary research aimed at informing estimates of the risk of
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) transmission via dentistry.
Background
----------
2. Prions are more resistant than other types of infectious agents to
the conventional cleaning and sterilization practices used to
decontaminate dental instruments (1). Appreciable quantities of
residual material may remain adherent to the surface after normal
cleaning and sterilization (2). Therefore, if dental tissues are both
infectious and susceptible to infection, the dental instruments are a
potential mechanism for the secondary transmission of vCJD. Dentistry
could be a particularly significant route of transmission for the
population as a whole, due to the large number of routine procedures
undertaken and also because dental patients have a normal life
expectancy.
This is in contrast with other transmission routes, such as blood
transfusion and neurosurgery, where procedures are often carried out
in response to some life-threatening condition. Additionally, the
ubiquity of dental procedures and the lack of central records on
dental procedures means that should such transmission occur, then it
would be difficult to detect and control.
3. No cases of vCJD transmission arising from dental procedures have
been reported to date (3). Previous DH risk assessments (4,5) have
focused on 2 possible mechanisms for the transfer of vCJD infectivity
via dental instruments; accidental abrasion of the lingual tonsil and
endodontic procedures that involve contact with dental pulp. In
considering these assessments, SEAC agreed that the risk of
transmission via accidental abrasion of the lingual tonsil appears
very low. However, the risk of transmission via endodontic procedures
may be higher and give rise to a self sustaining vCJD epidemic under
circumstances where (i) dental pulp is infective, (ii) transmission
via endodontic instruments is efficient and (iii) a large proportion
of vCJD infections remain in a subclinical carrier state (SEAC 91,
February 2006). In light of this, SEAC advised that restricting
endodontic files and reamers to single use be considered (6). SEAC
recommended reassessment of these issues as new data emerge.
New research
------------
4. Preliminary, unpublished results of research from the Health
Protection Agency, aimed at addressing some of the uncertainties in
the risk assessments, were reviewed by SEAC (SEAC 97, May 2007). The
prion agent used in these studies is closely related to the vCJD
agent. This research, using a mouse model, shows that following
inoculation of mouse-adapted bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
directly into the gut, infectivity subsequently becomes widespread in
tissues of the oral cavity, including dental pulp, salivary glands
and gingiva, during the preclinical as well as clinical stage of
disease.
5. It is not known how closely the level and distribution of
infectivity in the oral cavity of infected mice reflects those of
humans infected with vCJD, as there are no comparable data from oral
tissues, in particular dental pulp and gingiva, from human
subclinical or clinical vCJD cases (7). Although no abnormal prion
protein was found in a study of human dental tissues, including
dental pulp, salivary glands and gingiva from vCJD cases, the
relationship between levels of infectivity and abnormal prion protein
is unclear (8). Infectivity studies underway using the mouse model
and oral tissues that are presently available from human vCJD cases
will provide some comparable data. On the basis of what is currently
known, there is no reason to suppose that the mouse is not a good
model for humans in respect to the distribution of infectivity in
oral tissues. Furthermore, the new data are consistent with published
results from experiments using a hamster scrapie model (9).
6. A 2nd set of experiments using the same mouse model showed that
non-invasive and transient contact between gingival tissue and fine
dental files contaminated with mouse-adapted BSE brain homogenate
transmits infection very efficiently. It is not known how efficient
gingival transmission would be if dental files were contaminated with
infectious oral tissues and then subsequently cleaned and sterilized,
a situation which would more closely model human dental practice.
Further studies using the mouse model that would be more
representative of the human situation, comparing oral tissues with a
range of doses of infectivity, cleaned and sterilized files and the
kind of tissue contact with instruments that occurs during dentistry,
should be considered.
7. SEAC considered that the experiments appear well designed and the
conclusions justified and reliable, while recognizing that the
research is incomplete and confirmatory experiments have yet to be
completed. It is recommended that the research be completed,
submitted for peer-review and widely disseminated as soon as possible
so others can consider the implications. Nevertheless, these
preliminary data increase the possibility that some oral tissues of
humans infected with vCJD may potentially become infective during the
preclinical stage of the disease. In addition, they increase the
possibility that infection could potentially be transmitted not only
via accidental abrasion of the lingual tonsil or endodontic
procedures but a variety of routine dental procedures.
Implications for transmission risks
-----------------------------------
8. The new findings help refine assumptions made about the level of
infectivity of dental pulp and the stage of incubation period when it
becomes infective in the risk assessment of vCJD transmission from
the reuse of endodontic files and reamers (10). For example, if one
patient in 10 000 were to be carrying infection (equivalent to about
6000 people across the UK, the best current estimate (11), the data
suggest that in the worst case scenario envisaged in the risk
assessment, reuse of endodontic files and reamers might lead to up to
150 new infections per annum. It is not known how many of those
infected would go on to develop clinical vCJD. In addition,
transmission via the reuse of endodontic files and reamers could be
sufficiently efficient to cause a self-sustaining vCJD epidemic
arising via this route.
9. These results increase the importance of obtaining reliable
estimates of vCJD infection prevalence. Data that will soon be
available from the National Anonymous Tonsil Archive may help refine
this assessment and provide evidence of the existence and extent of
subclinical vCJD infection in tonsillectomy patients. Further data,
such as from post mortem tissue or blood donations, will be required
to assess prevalence in the general UK population (12).
10. Recent guidance issued by DH to dentists to ensure that
endodontic files and reamers are treated as single use (13) is
welcomed and should, as long as it is effectively and quickly
implemented, prevent transmission and a self-sustaining epidemic
arising via this route. However, the extent and monitoring of
compliance with this guidance in private and National Health Service
dental practice is unclear.
11. The new research also suggests that dental procedures involving
contact with other oral tissues, including gingiva, may also be
capable of transmitting vCJD. In the absence of a detailed risk
assessment examining the potential for transmission via all dental
procedures, it is not possible to come to firm conclusions about the
implications of these findings for transmission of vCJD. However,
given the potential for transmission by this route, serious
consideration should be given to assessing the options for reducing
transmission risks, such as improving decontamination procedures and
practice or the implementation of single use instruments.
12. The size of the potential risk from interactions between the
dental and other routes of secondary transmission, such as blood
transfusion and hospital surgery, to increase the likelihood of a
self-sustaining epidemic is unclear.
13. It is likely to be difficult to distinguish clinical vCJD cases
arising from dietary exposure to BSE from secondary transmissions via
dental procedures, should they arise, as a large proportion of the
population is likely both to have consumed contaminated meat and
undergone dentistry.
However, an analysis of dental procedures by patient age may provide
an indication of the age group in which infections, if they occur,
would be most likely to be observed. Should the incidence of clinical
vCJD cases in this age group increase significantly, this may provide
an indication that secondary transmission via dentistry is occurring.
Investigation of the dental work for these cases may provide
supporting data. There is no clear evidence, to date, based on
surveillance or investigations of clinical vCJD cases, that any vCJD
cases have been caused by dental procedures, but this possibility
cannot be excluded.
Conclusions
-----------
14. Preliminary research findings suggest that the potential risk of
transmission of vCJD via dental procedures may be greater than
previously anticipated. Although this research is incomplete, uses an
animal model exposed to relatively high doses of infectivity, and
there are no data from infectivity studies on human oral tissues,
these findings suggest an increased possibility that vCJD may be
relatively efficiently transmitted via a range of dental procedures.
Ongoing infectivity studies using human oral tissues and the other
studies suggested here will enable more precise assessment of the
risks of vCJD transmission through dental procedures.
15. Guidance was issued to dentists earlier this year [2007]
recommending that endodontic files and reamers be treated as single
use, which, provided this policy is adhered to, will remove any risk
of a self-sustaining epidemic arising from reuse of these
instruments. To minimize risk, it is critical that appropriate
management and audit is in place, both for NHS and private dentistry.
16. It is also critical that a detailed and comprehensive assessment
of the risks of all dental procedures be conducted as a matter of
urgency. While taking into account the continuing scientific
uncertainties, this will allow a more thorough consideration of the
possible public health implications of vCJD transmission via
dentistry and the identification of possible additional precautionary
risk reduction measures. The assessment will require continued
updating as more evidence becomes available on the transmissibility
of vCJD by dental routes, and on the prevalence of infection within
the population. A DH proposal to convene an expert group that
includes dental professionals to expedite such an assessment is
welcomed. Given the potential for transmission via dentistry,
consideration should be given to the urgent assessment of new
decontamination technologies which, if proven robust and effective,
could significantly reduce transmission risks.

Prion Protein Alleles Protecting Sheep from Scrapie and Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy
-----------------------------------------------
Current strategies for prevention and control of prion diseases in
sheep are based on breeding programs for the selection of sheep
carrying resistant genotypes. Nowadays, a single allele
(A136R154R171) of the prion protein (PrP) is associated with high
resistance. Vaccari et al. (see below) have now shown that additional
PrP alleles (A136, T137, R154, Q171, A136, K142, R154 Q171, A136,
R154, Q171 and K176) confer protection from scrapie and bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). These findings provide new targets
for refining breeding programs, allowing a certain extent of the PrP
gene variability to be maintained. This approach might ensure better
protection against scrapie, BSE, and new prion strains.
The paper is entitled: Prion Protein Alleles Showing a Protective
Effect on the Susceptibility of Sheep to Scrapie and Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy is authored by Gabriele Vaccari and 13
others at the Department of Food Safety and Veterinary Public Health,
Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy, and the Istituto
Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Regioni Lazio e Toscana, Rome,
Italy.
<http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/81/13/7306>.
The authors' abstract reads: "The susceptibility of sheep to
classical scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is
mainly influenced by prion protein (PrP) polymorphisms A136V, R154H,
and Q171R, with the ARR allele associated with significantly
decreased susceptibility. Here, we report the protective effect of
the amino acid substitution M137T, I142K, or N176K on the ARQ allele
in sheep experimentally challenged with either scrapie or BSE. Such
observations suggest the existence of additional PrP alleles that
significantly decrease the susceptibility of sheep to transmissible
spongiform encephalopathies, which may have important implications
for disease eradication strategies.
