On 10 Jan 2018, the Public Health Agency of Canada reported that an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections (STEC O157:H7 or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ - EHEC) they had identified that was linked to romaine lettuce appears to be over.

In the USA, CDC, several states, and the FDA continue to investigate a multistate outbreak of 24 EHEC O157:H7 infections in 15 states. Since CDC's initial media statement on 28 Dec 2017, 7 more illnesses have been added to this investigation. The last reported illness started on 12 Dec 2017.

The likely source of the outbreak in the USA appears to be leafy greens, but officials have not specifically identified a type of leafy greens eaten by people who became ill. Leafy greens typically have a short shelf life, and since the last illness started a month ago, it is likely that contaminated leafy greens linked to this outbreak are no longer available for sale. Canada identified romaine lettuce as the source of illnesses there, but the source of the romaine lettuce or where it became contaminated is unknown.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) showed that the EHEC O157:H7 strain from ill people in the USA is closely related genetically to the EHEC O157:H7 strain from ill people in Canada. WGS data alone are not sufficient to prove a link; health officials rely on other sources of data, such as interviews from ill people, to support the WGS link. This investigation is ongoing. Because CDC has not identified a specific type of leafy greens linked to the USA infections, and because of the short shelf life of leafy greens, CDC is not recommending that USA residents avoid any particular food at this time.

Outbreak Summary
------------------
In the USA, a total of 24 EHEC O157:H7 infections have been reported from California (4), Connecticut (2), Illinois (1), Indiana (2), Maryland (3), Michigan (1), Nebraska (1), New Hampshire (2), New Jersey (1), New York (1), Ohio (1), Pennsylvania (2), Vermont (1), Virginia (1), and Washington (1). Illnesses started on dates from 15 Nov 2017 through 12 Dec 2017. Among the 18 ill people for whom CDC has information, 9 were hospitalized, including one person in California who died. Two people developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure.

The Public Health Agency of Canada identified romaine lettuce as the source of the outbreak in Canada. In the USA, the likely source of the outbreak appears to be leafy greens, but health officials have not identified a specific type of leafy greens that sick people ate in common.

State and local public health officials continue to interview sick people in the USA to determine what they ate in the week before their illness started. Of 13 people interviewed, all 13 reported eating leafy greens. Five (56%) of 9 ill people specifically reported eating romaine lettuce. This percentage was not significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy people in which 46% reported eating romaine lettuce in the week before they were interviewed. Based on this information, American health officials concluded that ill people in this outbreak were not more likely than healthy people to have eaten romaine lettuce. Ill people also reported eating different types and brands of romaine lettuce. Currently, no common supplier, distributor, or retailer of leafy greens has been identified as a possible source of the outbreak. CDC continues to work with regulatory partners in several states, at the FDA, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to identify the source.

Although the most recent illness started on 12 Dec 2017, there is a delay between when someone gets sick and when the illness is reported to CDC. For EHEC O157:H7 infections, this period can be 2 to 3 weeks. Holidays can increase this delay. Because of these reporting delays, more time is needed before CDC can say the outbreak in the USA is over. This investigation is ongoing.

CDC is not recommending that USA residents avoid any particular food given the short shelf life of leafy greens and because a specific type of leafy greens has not been identified.

Most people develop diarrhea (often bloody) and stomach cramps. People usually get sick from _E. coli_ O157:H7 3-4 days after eating food contaminated with the germ. If you are concerned that you have an _E. coli_ infection, talk to your healthcare provider.

You can protect yourself by washing your hands thoroughly before and after preparing or eating food. You can also wash counters, cutting boards, and utensils after they touch raw meat to avoid contaminating other foods. It's also important to avoid preparing food when you are sick, particularly if you are sick with diarrhea.

[It is possible that the contaminated lots of romaine lettuce associated with the Canadian cases were processed into leafy green salads so that the specific green could not be linked in the USA. - Mod.LL
