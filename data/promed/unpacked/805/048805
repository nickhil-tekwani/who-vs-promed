Foot and mouth disease found in north west China swine
------------------------------------------------------
New cases of foot and mouth disease [FMD] were found in north west China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Qinghai Province on Tuesday [29 Jun
2010], a statement from the press office of China's Ministry of Agriculture
said.

According to the statement, 24 pigs raised by some farmers in the western
suburbs of Aksu City, Xinjiang, were suspected to have contracted a new
strain of FMD, which was identified as O-type, on 19 Jun 2010. This was
confirmed on Friday [25 Jun 2010].

Another case was also confirmed on Saturday [26 Jun 2010] in Menyuan County
of Qinghai, where 17 other swine raised on an animal farm were first
suspected of having the same virus last Tuesday [22 Jun 2010].

Altogether 508 infected swine have been slaughtered in the 2 regions so
far. The situation is under control, the statement said.
