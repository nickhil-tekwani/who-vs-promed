In the Karaganda region [Qaraghandy oblast] of Kazakhstan, an unknown virus killed a horse.

African glanders is the name of this exotic disease that veterinarians cannot find any drugs or vaccines for. It is for this reason that the village of Aktobe in the Karaganda region closed for quarantine for more than 6 months.

A villager is very scared, because last summer he lost just 2 stallions. And now he is watching very carefully. "1st there were sores on his legs. Usually on the rear legs is where it all began. Sores spread rapidly throughout the body and strongly festered," he says.

The disease's presence is even felt in the winter. At 1st, people tried to treat the animals on their own, but all their efforts were in vain.

"We took the tests samples to the laboratory. The laboratory informed us that the animals are sick with infectious lymphangitis, or else this disease is called 'African glanders.' In the Karaganda region, that has never happened. And in all the world there is not a vaccine or a cure for this," says veterinarian Boranbek Sultans.

Sick animals had to [be slaughtered and buried in] the cattle cemetery. Such meat is strictly prohibited.

All the buildings in the village have been disinfected, and the herd is no longer allowed nearer to the village than a kilometer.

Previously the disease was registered only a few times in Kazakhstan. African glanders -- possibly a vector borne disease -- may affect only equines: horses, donkeys, and mules. It is believed that carriers are only sick animals, humans and other livestock; it is not transmitted.

African glanders or African farcy is NOT the same disease known as glanders or farcy, nor is it caused by _Burkholderia mallei_.

Rather, African glanders may have a fungal component.

Epizootic lymphangitis is a debilitating fungal disease seen mainly in equids. The most common form of this disease is an ulcerative, suppurative, spreading dermatitis and lymphangitis; however, other forms including pneumonia or ulcerative conjunctivitis also occur. Epizootic lymphangitis spreads most readily where large numbers of animals are assembled, and it was a serious problem during the early 20th century when large numbers of horses were stabled together. This disease continues to be a significant concern in some countries such as Ethiopia, where the prevalence in carthorses is nearly 19 percent, and economic losses from this disease are high.

Epizootic lymphangitis results from infection by a dimorphic fungus, _Histoplasma capsulatum_ var. _farciminosum_. This organism has also been known as _Histoplasma farciminosum_, _Cryptococcus farciminosis_, _Zymonema farciminosa_, and _Saccharomyces farciminosus_. _H. capsulatum_ var. _farciminosum_ exists as a yeast in animal tissues and a saprophytic mycelium in the environment. Recent genetic evidence suggests that the isolates causing epizootic lymphangitis originated independently from different geographical clades of _Histoplasma capsulatum_. Based on this evidence, some authors question the existence of the variety _H. capsulatum_ var. _farciminosum_, and consider epizootic lymphangitis to be a form of histoplasmosis, caused by _H. capsulatum_, that occurs in horses.

Epizootic lymphangitis mainly affects horses, donkeys and mules. _H. capsulatum_ var. _farciminosum_ has also been reported in camels, cattle and dogs, and experimental infections have been established in mice, guinea pigs and rabbits.

_H. capsulatum_ var. _farciminosum_ infects animals through wounds. Both the yeast form found in animals and the mycelial form in the environment can produce epizootic lymphangitis after experimental inoculation. The source of the organisms can be the skin lesions and nasal and ocular exudates of infected animals, or the soil. In its saprophytic mycelial phase, _H. capsulatum_ var. _farciminosum_ can survive for many months in warm, moist environments. This organism can also be spread on fomites such as grooming or harness equipment.

Biting flies in the genera _Musca_ and _Stomoxys_ are thought to spread the conjunctival form. Flies may also transmit the skin form mechanically when they feed on lesions and exudates. Ticks might be involved in transmission; in a recent study, tick bites appeared to be a predisposing factor for epizootic lymphangitis in mules. The pulmonary form, which is rare, probably develops when an animal inhales the organism.

Incubation may vary from several weeks to as much as 2 months.

The most common form of epizootic lymphangitis affects the skin and lymphatics. It often occurs on the extremities, chest wall, face and neck, but can be seen wherever the organism is inoculated into a wound. The 1st symptom is a painless, freely moveable intradermal nodule, approximately 2 cm in diameter. This nodule enlarges and eventually bursts. In some cases, the lesions may be small and inconspicuous, and heal spontaneously. More often, the skin ulcers grow, with cycles of granulation and partial healing followed by new eruptions. The surrounding skin is edematous at 1st, and later becomes thickened, hard and variably painful. The skin over the nodules may be fixed to the underlying tissues. The regional lymph nodes can be enlarged, but fever is uncommon. The infection also spreads along the lymphatics, causing cord-like thickening and further skin involvement. These cycles of exacerbation and partial healing gradually resolve, leaving only a scar. The process usually takes about 2 to 3 months. Epizootic lymphangitis sometimes spreads to the underlying joints and results in severe arthritis. Occasionally, there may be ulcerative conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis, a serous or purulent nasal discharge, or pneumonia. Extensive lesions can end in death; this usually occurs in areas where animals are in poor condition and veterinary care is limited.

In dogs, both cutaneous infections and infections that disseminate to internal organs have been reported.

Epizootic lymphangitis can be diagnosed by detecting _H. capsulatum_ var. _farciminosum_ in lesions. Histopathology or the direct examination of smears from exudates is helpful in diagnosis. _H. capsulatum_ var. _farciminosum_ can be cultured on a variety of fungal media.

Epizootic lymphangitis can be controlled or eradicated by quarantines and the euthanasia of infected animals. Screening may help identify cases. Infected premises and equipment must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. _H. capsulatum_ can be inactivated by 1 percent sodium hypochlorite, glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde and phenolic disinfectants. Its susceptibility to 70 percent ethanol is questionable. This organism is also destroyed by moist heat of 121 deg C for at least 15 minutes. Bedding should be burned. Organisms in the soil may survive for long periods.

In endemic areas, good cleaning and disinfection can help prevent _H. capsulatum_ var. _farciminosum_ from spreading between animals. Care should be taken to prevent transmission on grooming equipment or harnesses. Early cases may be treated with sodium or potassium iodide, but the lesions may later recur. Amphotericin B has also been used, but it is more expensive. In some cases, nodules may be drained and packed with iodine, or excised surgically. Vaccines are not widely available; however, live and inactivated vaccines have been used in some endemic regions. Published reports suggest that some of these vaccines may be promising.

While there may be vaccines available, it is clearly not available in the Qaraghandy region of Kazakhstan. At the very least an autogenous vaccine may be possible, but certainly scrupulous hygiene is in order, especially on this particular premises as it seems to have been present for a previous case.

[If this is indeed caused by the same organism that causes Histoplasmosis in humans, the differences in geographic distribution, clinical presentation, and modes of transmission are fascinating. - Mod.LM]
