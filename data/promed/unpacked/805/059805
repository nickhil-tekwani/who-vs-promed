Indonesia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 19
----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed the country's 50th
case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.
The case, which was fatal, occurred in a 7-year-old girl from
Tangerang district, Banten Province. She developed symptoms on 26
May, was hospitalized on 30 May, and died on 1 Jun 2006. Her
10-year-old brother died of respiratory disease on 29 May, but no
specimens were taken for testing and the cause of his death cannot be
determined.
An investigation found a history of chicken deaths in the household
and neighbourhood prior to symptom onset. Laboratory testing of
surviving family members and close contacts has been conducted and no
further cases were found.
Of the 50 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 38 have been fatal.

[WHO's comment in its Update 18 remains highly relevant (see ref. 81
below): "The newly confirmed case is one of several where exposure
occurred despite a clear signal of a high-risk situation arising from
poultry deaths. Pending better control of the disease in animals, WHO
and officials in the Ministry of Health see an urgent need to improve
public awareness of this disease, the risk factors for infection, and
the behaviours that should be avoided."
