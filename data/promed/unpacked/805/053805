RINDERPEST - TANZANIA: NOT

A ProMED-mail post

ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases

Date: Thu, 10 Jul 2003
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>

On 27 May 2003, ProMED-mail posted a RFI posting [20030606.1388] citing a
news item (monitored by BBC), saying that "Tanzania has banned movement of
livestock from Zambia to curb an outbreak of rinderpest in Sumbawanga
District, Rukwa Region". Confirmation or refuting of the said information
was requested in the moderator's commentary.
An e-mail from the Tanzanian Veterinary Services was received several days
later by ProMED-mail without the attachment said to include their response.
ProMED-mail contacted Tanzania on 16 Jun 2003, requesting a copy of their
response. Unfortunately, no reply has been received. Subsequently, we have
approached the OIE information department for their assistance. In their
prompt reply, for which ProMED-mail is most grateful, the OIE informed us
that a clarifying message was distributed on 23 Jun 2003 by
EMPRES-Livestock [An FAO-based Emergency Prevention System for
Transboundary Animal Diseases], containing a statement made by
the Veterinary Services of Tanzania.
In view of the importance of the issue, we find it appropriate to include
here the following information, derived from the said statement:
"There was no such report like rinderpest in the period stated in the
broadcasted news. Furthermore it was just recently, in March 2003, that a
team of veterinary experts in collaboration with PACE AU/IBAR
[Inter-African Bureau for Animal Resources of the African Union] wildlife
experts carried out a rinderpest serological survey among wildlife in the
Mkomazi ecosystem (comprising Mikumi, Ruaha, and Katavi in the Rukwa
region). This survey was intended to establish whether rinderpest virus is
circulating in wildlife in the southern regions of Tanzania. A similar
survey is underway in livestock between June and August 2003. These surveys
are planned in accordance with the OIE protocols required for a
rinderpest-free declaration.
From this surveillance work, we were able to establish that there is no
rinderpest virus circulating, and following the stipulated procedure, we
are preparing a report to inform the OIE and the world at large of these
findings. Our Rinderpest Emergency Preparedness Plan is working, and we can
definitely assure the world there is no rinderpest outbreak in Tanzania".
ProMED-mail is pleased to post the said clarification, refuting the
previously publicized information. We shall be pleased to obtain the
mentioned Tanzanian report with the epidemiological findings related to
rinderpest and to relay its contents to members. - Mod.AS.
