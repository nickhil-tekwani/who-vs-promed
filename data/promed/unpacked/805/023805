Since this was 1st posted (ProMED-mail 20070808.2575) I have been in
conversation with various folk in Canada as to what actually
happened, compared to the initial news report. As of 22 Aug 2007, the
number of positive premises for anthrax in the Interlake region of
Manitoba is 22. Premises are defined by the quarter section. The time
series is as follows:
11 Jul 2007 (1 outbreak, 1st deaths noted); 14 Jul 2007 (1); 15 Jul
2007 (2); 17 Jul 2007 (1); 22 Jul 2007 (2); 23 Jul 2007 (1); 24 Jul
2007 (2); 26 Jul 2007 (2); 27 Jul 2007 (1); 28 Jul 2007 (1); 1 Aug
2007 (1); 2 Aug 2007 (1); 3 Aug 2007 (1); 5 Aug 2007 (2); 7 Aug 2007
(1); 8 Aug 2007 (1); 12 Aug 2007 (1).
It seems that a meaningful number (actual number is being determined)
of the initial 14 affected farms had 'recently' had Manitoba Hydro
power lines installed across some ranches in an area, which had had
anthrax at least as recently as 1942 (anecdotal human case buried in
a local cemetery). This involved digging 9-ft (approx. 3 m) holes for
each of the pylon posts. If true, this could explain the nature of
the sudden series of cases in an area not known to have active anthrax.
Also, that the 1st samples were received in Winnipeg on 18 Jul 2007;
positively checked for capsulated organisms and so promptly reported;
laboratory culture confirmation on the 20 Aug 2007 ... all in all,
very much on the ball.
As soon as the initial diagnosis was provided CFIA (Canadian Food
Inspection Agency) promptly mobilized their Winnipeg store of some
3-5000 doses of vaccine and the ranchers were actively encouraged to
get their stock vaccinated as soon as possible. For whatever reason
ranchers were not advised to treat exposed stock with LA200 prior to
vaccination. The region is in the interface between deciduous
broadleaf trees and conifers, with meadows and not open grasslands,
so collecting up stock does take time and effort.
As there have been no new outbreaks in the past week, it is probable
that this small epidemic is now over. The premises are clustered in
an area where the boundaries of these 3 municipalities meet (Rural
Municipalities of Armstrong, Rockwood and St. Andrews). The cluster
is fairly tight, with the furthest ranches being some 5 miles (8 km)
to the east and 6 or so miles (about 10 km) to the NNW of the index
outbreak. Of the 22 premises, 7 had some form of excavation in the
recent past on the pasture involved in the outbreak. This part of the
Interlake region experienced heavy rains this spring [2007] and was
hot and dry in late June and in July [2007] -- a classic 'Texas
Paradigm' scenario for horsefly-spread anthrax. The region also has
swampy areas.
I very much appreciate the input from the following persons: Wayne
Lees, chief veterinary officer, Manitoba Agriculture Food, and Rural
Initiatives, MAFRI; Sandra Stephens (CFIA, SK); Gopi Nayari (MB
Veterinary Services Branch); Chris Green (MAFRI), Terrey Whiting
(MAFRI), Lynn Bates (CFIA, MB).
