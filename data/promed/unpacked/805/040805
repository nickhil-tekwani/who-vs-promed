Confirmation of West Nile Virus-positive Crow in North Florida
--------------------------------------------------------------
TALLAHASSEE: The Florida Department of Health has confirmed West Nile virus
(WNV) in one crow from Jefferson County, state health officials announced
today. This is the first time WNV, a virus transmitted by mosquitoes, has
been identified in the state. Although there are no reported human cases of
the disease, Florida Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Robert G. Brooks,
M.D., urges all Floridians to be aware of the possible risks and to follow
personal protection measures.
Dr. Brooks stated that: "In anticipation of this event, the Department has
developed an interagency response plan in coordination with the Department
of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission, Department of Environmental Protection, and
Department of Consumer Affairs and Florida universities. Our
well-established arboviral surveillance system will enable us to move
quickly to further define the current situation. In the meantime, we
encourage the public to follow established preventive measures to reduce
their exposure to mosquitoes."
Prior to August 1999, WNV had never been reported in the Western
Hemisphere. From 1999 to 2000, a total of 82 cases of disease and 9 deaths
occurred in the New York City and New Jersey metropolitan areas. Mosquitoes
spread the virus by feeding on the blood of infected birds, which circulate
the virus in their system. The disease cannot be spread from person to
person. For the year-to-date, there have been no human encephalitis cases
due to West Nile, St Louis encephalitis, or eastern equine encephalitis
viruses in the state.

[Prior to this report only 23 dead crows have tested West Nile
virus-positive in the year 2001: i.e. New Jersey 14, Maryland 4, New York
2, Rhode Island 2, Connecticut 1. In the preceding year, a total of 4323
birds tested West Nile virus-positive in 12 states (Connecticut, Delaware,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Hew Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia) plus the
District of Columbia. The appearance of West Nile virus in Florida means
that the virus has spread from the northeastern states to the southeast,
apparently skipping the intervening states of South Carolina and Georgia. -

[As of this time last year -- 2000 -- only 8 birds had tested West Nile
virus-positive, so 23 positives already could signify that we have a bad
year ahead, at least for birds. However, last year's experience showed that
more dead birds do not necessarily translate into more dead humans. - Mod.JW
