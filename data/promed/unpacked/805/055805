This newspaper report indicated that the manatee population of Florida may
be experiencing a widespread outbreak of papillomavirus infection and
disease. The manatee herd at Homosassa Springs State Wildlife park has
been quarantined for the past year and a half but now it is reported that
manatees outside the quarantine zone have been observed to have skin
lesions [Summary by Mod.CHC

Lesions similar to those documented on captive manatees at Homosassa
Springs State Wildlife Park in Florida, USA, have begun to appear and
spread rapidly among wild manatees in the Homosassa River, wildlife experts
said Thursday.
Several weeks ago, the lesions began showing up on manatees in the Crystal
River.
The rapid succession of the infection, tracked by researchers for two
months, was described Thursday to about 50 officials representing the
various agencies that deal with manatees. The researchers said the lesions
could be the beginning stages of an infection that will cause the
endangered manatees no problems. Or it could be a quickly spreading disease
that could lead to cancer and death. Researchers said they expect the
effect to be somewhere in between those extremes.
"This is the first time a virus has been discovered in manatees," local
veterinarian Mark Lowe said. "The big concern is this is an endangered
species." Whether the lesions caused by the virus are a harmless skin
condition or the precursor of a manatee killer, the spreading illness needs
to be researched intently, and immediately. The sores are thought to be
caused by the same manatee virus that has kept the herd at the Homosassa
Springs State Wildlife Park in quarantine for the past year and a half.
Lesions have turned up on 8 and possibly all 9 of the park's captive herd.
"They [the lesions seem to come and go in a cyclical pattern," said Dr.
Lowe. In January, researchers began to notice similar pimple-like lesions
on wild manatees that congregate just outside the state park in an area
known as the Homosassa Blue Waters.
Greg Bossart, a manatee researcher from the Miami Seaquarium detailed the
outcome of several biopsies from both the captive and wild manatees and
explained that the virus had only been confirmed in animals inside the
park. However, the virus can go dormant and isn't always detectable.
Bossart said he suspects the wild manatees have the same infection.
Lowe said the virus itself has [probably always been present in the
manatee's environment, but something has recently caused it to surface with
symptoms. The virus can go dormant, so there may never be proof of its
long-term existence. Even though tissue samples from manatees that have
died have been kept for years, they might never show signs of the virus
even if the animals had it, Lowe said.
The park's manatees are living in a place with a constant freshwater spring
flow. The water temperature is a constant 72 degrees, give or take a
degree. The animals are always in close contact with one another, which is
only true at certain times with wild manatees. Wild manatees move from
freshwater to saltwater and through a variety of temperatures.
Joyce Kleen, biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, noted the
uncertainty of how the disease is spread from animal to animal. Manatees
spend a lot of time nuzzling one another. But what about snorkelers who
might go from one area to another or researchers who might be in the water
with Blue Waters manatees one morning and in the Crystal River in the
afternoon. "We don't even know, should they scrub down in between?" Kleen
said.
Bossart said he suspects that one of three things will happen with the
manatee virus as researchers continue to examine it. The virus could cause
benign lesions that will clear up after a few months to a year, and the
animal will have some limited immunity to infection in the future.
Or it could be an emerging disease that stays in their systems and now and
then causes warts but not anything life-threatening. Bossart said the
worst-case scenario is that, in time, the tumors could become malignant
cancers and threaten the animals.
Papillomavirus is species specific, which means that people cannot catch it
from manatees. In many animals it causes no problem, but in some sea life,
such as turtles, [these viruses have caused lesions covering eyes or
nostrils, threatening an animal's ability to survive. In humans, the virus
is associated with cervical cancer in women.
