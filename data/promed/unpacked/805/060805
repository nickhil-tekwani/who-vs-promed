7 Maine mares have been quarantined for potential exposure to a
contagious venereal horse disease.

State Veterinarian Don Hoenig warned Maine horse owners and breeders
this morning [28 Jan 2009] that there are 10 known stallions outside
of Maine that have tested positive for contagious equine metritis and
have potentially exposed hundreds of horses around the nation.

The disease is spread when horses are bred or artificially
inseminated, or congenitally from mares to their foals.

The disease can cause infertility or spontaneous abortion. It is
treated with antibiotics and disinfectants. It does not affect humans.

The 7 horses in Maine are being tested for the disease, which has not
been detected in any of the horses tested so far in other states.

[[Initial exposure to the disease usually results in infertility. An
infected mare may fail to conceive (revealed by an early return to
estrus after breeding) or she may spontaneously abort. Abortions
related to CEM are rare, however. Stallions exhibit no clinical signs
but can carry the CEM bacteria on their external genitalia for years.

There are three general degrees of infection in mares.
? Acute: Active inflammation of the uterus causes an obvious thick,
milky, mucoid vulvar discharge 10 to 14 days after breeding.
? Chronic: Milder uterine inflammation causes less obvious vulvar
discharge, and infection may be more difficult to eliminate.
? Carrier: The bacteria are established in the reproductive tract. The
mare, though asymptomatic, is still infectious and can remain a
carrier for several months or longer.

Diagnosis
---------
2 of the most common genital infections in mares are caused by
_Klebsiella_ and _Pseudomonas_ spp. bacteria. Differentiating these
infections from CEM cannot be reliably done except by laboratory
isolation of _T. equigenitalis_.

Swabs for bacteriologic cultures from mares are taken from the cervix
or endometrium of the uterus during estrus, clitoral fossa, and
clitoral sinuses. One must remember that mares are seasonally
anestrus. The winter time in Maine will cause the mare to be in
anestrus and the cultures cannot be obtained. Mares may not come into
estrus again unless they are kept under lights to trick the system.
Building up the "lighted" time the mare is exposed to will still take
time. Consequently these mares may be quarantined for many months.
First to get a culture and secondly to get the mare treated.
