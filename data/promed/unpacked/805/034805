Rift Valley Fever outbreak
--------------------------
There were 7 confirmed cases of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in the Free
State and Northern Cape and one death reported, the deputy minister
of health said on Monday [8 Mar 2010].

"A 45-year-old patient who was admitted to a mine hospital on 26 Feb
2010 with a provisional diagnosis of Congo fever, died a day later
and confirmation of RVF was made on 4 Mar 2010," said Molefi Sefularo
in a statement. "The 6 others, who had mild disease, continue to be
under observation and treatment." Sefularo, who was on an inspection
tour of the Pelonomi hospital in the Free State to inspect the level
of readiness of health facilities for the FIFA World Cup, said the
disease posed no threat to the event. "I would like to place it on
record that this occurrence does not constitute a crisis. The
outbreak is being contained," he said.

RVF is a communicable virus, endemic in South Africa and other
African countries. In animals, the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes
and causes outbreaks of abortion and deaths of young sheep, cattle
and goats. It [can be] transmitted to humans through contact with
infected livestock through direct or indirect contact with blood or
organs of infected animals; the handling of animal tissue during
slaughtering or butchering of animals or assisting with animal
births; conducting veterinary services or through being cut by
infected knives or needles among other things.

Sefularo said 15 farms had reported laboratory confirmed animal cases
with extensive livestock deaths. The affected farms were primarily
clustered around the Lejweleputswa District in the Bultfontein area.
He said no human-to-human transmission had occurred. Symptoms of the
virus were mild fever, headaches and muscle pain.

Sefularo appealed to farming communities in the Free State and
Northern Cape to avoid high risk husbandry procedures and
slaughtering practices by using gloves and protective clothing and to
avoid the consumption of fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue.

[Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects
animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. Infection can
cause severe disease in both animals and humans, leading to high
rates of disease and death. The disease also results in significant
economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected
livestock. The virus was 1st identified in 1931 during an
investigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift
Valley of Kenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported elsewhere
in Africa.

The vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect
contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can
be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during
slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting
veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.
Certain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, abbatoir
workers and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection.
Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected
mosquitoes, most commonly the _Aedes_ mosquito, and transmission of
RVF virus by hematophagous (blood-feeding) flies is also possible.

While most human cases are relatively mild, a small percentage of
patients develop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually
appears as one or more of 3 distinct syndromes: ocular disease (0.5-2
percent of patients), meningoencephalitis (less than 1 percent) or
haemorrhagic fever (less than 1 percent). The total case fatality
rate has varied widely between different epidemics but, overall, has
been less than 1 percent in those documented. Most fatalities occur
in patients who develop the haemorrhagic icterus form.

As outbreaks of RVF in animals precede human cases, the establishment
of an active animal health surveillance system to detect new cases is
essential in providing early warning for veterinary and human public
health authorities. Further information can be obtained at:
