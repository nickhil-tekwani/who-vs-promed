This circular follows all previous dengue circulars and reviews all
epidemiological information available at the present time.
Countries and territories appear in the table below in chronological order,
according to the date the current Dengue-2 (DEN-2) virus epidemic began.
1. Summary of DEN-2 virus situation as reported by Pacific Island countries
and territories:

2. Summary of descriptive data
French Polynesia: Dengue 2 epidemic
Between August 1996 and 1st April 1997, the total number of new notified
clinical cases was 6,537, while the provisional number of confirmed new cases
was 1,785. The monthly number of new notified clinical cases fell back to
1,656 in February and 443 in March. This would appear to indicate that the
epidemic is in decline. Only one death was recorded.
Australia, Torres Strait Islands: Dengue 2 epidemic
Between the beginning of December 1996 and 10 April 1997, 200 new cases of
Dengue 2 were notified. The virus was isolated in 108 cases.
New Caledonia: contained Dengue 2 epidemic: endemic circulation of the Dengue
3 virus....importation of Dengue 1?
The first case of Dengue 2 since 1972 was notified in the week
beginning 9 December 1996. Between that time and 11 April 1997, 102
new clinical cases of dengue were notified, including 68 which were
confirmed by laboratory examination:
45 for DEN-2 virus
22 for DEN-3 virus
1 for DEN-1 virus (probably imported from South-east Asia, according
to the initial results of the epidemiological surveys conducted by the
relevant health authority). No deaths were reported.
Cook Islands: DEN-2 virus epidemic
Between 28 December 1996 and 12 April 1997, 720 new clinical cases of dengue
were reported in the Cook Islands, with the weekly number of new notified
cases rising to 113 for the week ending 12 April. The samples initially sent
to Australia for virological diagnosis all tested positive for DEN-2 virus.
91 cases were admitted to Rarotonga Hospital. No deaths were
recorded.
Australia, Cairns: appearance of DEN-2 virus
Very recently, 7 clinical cases of locally acquired dengue were notified; so
far, 3 have been confirmed by the laboratory as being DEN-2 cases.
3. Micromolecular biology: additional epidemiological data, provided by
the laboratories
The viral strains from French Polynesia, the Cook Island and New Caledonia
are very similar, which confirms the virus responsible for the epidemic in
French Polynesia was indeed exported to New Caledonia and to Cook Islands,
subsequently being propagated in both locations.
A different strain of DEN-2 virus is responsible for the Torres Strait
epidemic.
The issue of whether or not these two strains of DEN-2 virus could be
simultaneously in circulation in the same place is still unresolved; also
unless is the issue of the entry route to the Pacific and where these two
viral strains originated: south-east or southern Asia, Latin America,
[Africa]?
The similarity between the molecular sequences of the viral strains, which
make it possible to trace viruses, is important in that reflects trends in
travel between Pacific Island countries and territories. In the modern
Pacific, men and women travel to the furthest corners of the region for
family, business, tourism, health and training reasons amongst others. This
reality would appear to have a corollary: epidemiological information must
circulate as fast as people do.
In other words, beyond its sophisticated scientific dimension, the
biomolecular study of the DEN-2 virus epidemic currently striking the Pacific
stresses the importance of rapid exchanges of simple epidemiological
information for the sole purpose of restricting the extent and impact of
dengue epidemics in the region and also of other diseases, viral diseases in
particular.
In fact, in the event of the emergence of cases of dengue (for example) in a
Pacific Island country or territory, the early warning provided by the
Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network (PPHSN) should make it possible
for the most directly concerned countries or territories to immediately take
low-cost, simple and effective action:
a) Alert and inform health professionals and other institutionals players
concerned;
b) Intensify surveillance of acute febrile diseases of unknown origin;
c) Provide information to the public and urge the community to reduce
potential breeding sites;
d) Prepare the resources necessary for vector control and curative responses
to possible severe forms of dengue (hypovolemic shock syndrome).
