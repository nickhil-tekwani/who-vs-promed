The Ministry of Health reported this Wednesday [24 Jun 2010] that the
cases of equine encephalitis remained at 15, of whom one died. A
statement form the ministry said that 4 people living in the province
of Darien are under observation at a public hospital. The ministry
indicated that 63 people are under observation for presenting
symptoms of the disease.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported that this Wednesday [24 Jun
2010] there were no recorded cases of equine encephalitis, so that
the number of cases admitted to Children's Hospital, remains at 15.
Of the 15 cases who were admitted to hospital since the start of the
event [outbreak], 4 remain hospitalized in stable condition, 10 were
discharged, and one died.

During field investigation in Darien and Panama East, so far there
remain 63 individuals suspected [of having the infection] who have
not required hospitalization, from whom blood (samples) were obtained
for laboratory studies and monitoring.

The MOH reiterates that it is important that people with any signs or
symptoms such as fever, headache, bone pain, irritability if it
involves children less than one year of age, vomiting or diarrhea,
contact their nearest health centre for medical evaluation.

For its part, the Directorate of Health Promotion has trained more
than 2000 people in the provinces of Darien and Panama Este, among
them students and local authorities to pay visits, house by house.
Also, 10 000 leaflets and posters have been distributed giving
accurate information for the prevention of this disease. At the same
time, during this week public information officials will visit the
communities of Santa Librada, El Mercadeo, Yaviza, Nuevo Progreso,
and Aguas Frias in Darien, and this Saturday [26 Jun 2010] a mosquito
breeding site elimination campaign will take place in the
metropolitan health Region of Nuevo Tocumen.

The MOH has established sentinel posts in medical centers in the
province of Darien, to capture suspected [infected individuals] and
cases of febrile patients in the area. In the Meteti Medical Center,
health personnel will be available to attend hospitalized patients
and emergency cases.

[The MOH] reiterates to the population that to reduce the possibility
that the disease moves to other communities, they should increase the
recommended sanitary measures such as eliminating mosquito breeding
sites, pouring lime into latrines, use of mosquito bed nets and
clothing that covers most of the body (long pants, long sleeved
shirts), and mosquito repellents.

[Although the specific etiological agent involved in these cases is
not stated in this report, this appears to be a continuation of the
outbreak reported on 19 Jun 2010 as eastern equine encephalitis virus
(EEEV) infections (see ProMED archive no. 20100621.2080). It would be
of interest to know if EEEV has been laboratory confirmed in these cases.
