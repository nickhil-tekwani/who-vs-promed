Correction: E. coli O157, water contamination - Switzerland (Black Forest)
-----------------------------------------------
Please note that there are 2 cities named Freiburg, one in
Switzerland, and one in Germany.
The Swiss canton Freiburg or Fribourg is located in the Jura
mountains. Its capital, the city of Freiburg im Uechtland or
Fribourg, bears the same name as a German city located further north.
The Jura is NOT the Black Forest. The "Epi-Notice: Bloody diarrhea
and hemolytic uremic syndrome in Freiburg" refers to a report on a
drinking water contamination in the village of Haut-Intyamon in the
Canton of Freiburg, Switzerland.
About 200 km by car further north is the German city of "Freiburg im
Breisgau," in the Rhine valley, and partly on the foothills of the
Black Forest. There was no drinking water contamination in Freiburg,
Germany or in the neighboring Black Forest.
