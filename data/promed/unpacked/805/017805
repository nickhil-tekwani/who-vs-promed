The hospitals of Liberia and Puntarenas continue receiving cases of dengue
[fever, although according to [hospital officials, the situation is under
control. In the dengue unit, of the Enrique Baltodano Hospital of Liberia,
yesterday they cared for four ill Liberianos with classical dengue fever,
two of whom had hemorrhagic manifestations. In the Monsenor Sanabria
Hospital of Puntarenas, they cared for an average of 10 Puntarensians [with
dengue each day. According to physicians of both health centers, these
figures [numbers of cases are found to be much lower than those [during
the epidemic of dengue in 1997. Nevertheless, both hospitals are keeping
guard.
Last 24 August, the Ministry of Health decreed the maximum alert for
dengue, following the appearance of the first cases of [dengue 2 virus in
Puntarenas. This had produced the appearance, in the port, of cases each
time more severe, and had affected, principally, persons younger than 22
years old. The [situation in the port had obliged the Liberian population
to take measures, in fear that this new form of dengue would arrive
[there. The sites of the port with the highest incidence of dengue are
the central area and the barrio of Carmen. In Liberia, the areas most
affected are the barrios of Los Cerros and Los Angeles.
According to Mario Sanchez Chaverri, coordinator of the dengue unit of the
Monsenor Sanabria [Hospital in Puntarenas, if the situation remains stable
to the first of October [the possibility of an epidemic can be excluded.
