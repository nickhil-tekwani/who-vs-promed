Occupationally Acquired Simian Foamy Virus Infection and Blood Donation
-------------------------------------------------
In 2002 I was involved in a study that documented occupationally acquired
SFV infection in individuals who were working with non-human primates. Our
interest was in the fact that they were also blood donors, and we were
concerned about transfusion transmission. The paper is titled "Simian Foamy
Virus Infection in a Blood Donor", RS Boneva, AJ Grindon, SL Orton, eta..
Transfusion 2002 Jul; 42(7) 886-891.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Sharyn Orton for drawing attention to this relevant
investigation. The abstract of the paper by Bonvena et al. provides the
following detailed (and somewhat reassuring) information:
"Infections with simian foamy virus (SFV) are widely prevalent in nonhuman
primates. SFV infection was confirmed in a worker, occupationally exposed
to nonhuman primates, who donated blood after the retrospectively
documented date of infection. Human-to-human transmission of SFV through
transfusion and its pathogenicity had not been investigated previously.
Recipients of blood from this donor were identified and blood samples from
such recipients were tested for SFV infection by Western blot and PCR assay.
One recipient of RBCs and another recipient of FFP had died; retroviral
infections were not implicated. One platelet recipient could not be tested.
Recipients of RBCs (2), a WBC-reduced RBC unit (one), and a platelet unit
(one) tested SFV-negative 19 months to 7 years after transfusion. Tested
recipients had transfusions 3 to 35 days after blood donation. Samples of
one lot of albumin and 3 lots of plasma protein fraction (manufactured from
recovered plasma from two donations) tested negative both for antibodies
and for viral RNA.
The conclusion was that SFV transmission through transfusion was not
identified among 4 recipients of cellular blood components from one
SFV-infected donor. Derivatives containing plasma from that donor tested
negative for SFV."
