[Black-necked grebes (_Podiceps nigricollis_) are aquatic birds that breed in vegetated areas of freshwater lakes across Europe, Asia, Africa, northern South America, and the southwest and western United States. After breeding, this bird migrates to saline lakes to moult. For a picture go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-necked_grebe#/media/File:Black-necked_Grebe_Schwarzhalstaucher.jpg.

This report is describing a large die-off of this bird. This is due to their highly gregarious behavior, forming large colonies when breeding and large flocks when not. - Mod.PMB
