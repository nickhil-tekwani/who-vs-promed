An Indonesian man from Riau province on Sumatra island has died of
bird flu, taking the country's death toll from the disease to 91, a
health ministry official said on Saturday [10 Nov 2007]. It was not
clear whether the 31-year-old man who died on Tuesday [6 Nov 2007]
had been in contact with sick fowl, the most common way of
contracting the disease, health ministry spokeswoman Lili
Sulistyowati said by telephone text message.

Another official at the ministry's bird flu centre said the man, who
had been suffering from a cough, fever and breathing difficulties,
died while being transferred from a local hospital in Duri district
to a hospital in Pekanbaru, the provincial capital. "It is not clear
about his contact with sick fowl, but our investigation team has been
there," said Joko Suyono at the bird flu centre.

Bird flu is endemic in bird populations in most parts of Indonesia,
where people often keep backyard chickens for meat and eggs or to
supplement income. Indonesia, which has had the most number of human
deaths from the H5N1 virus globally, has had 133 confirmed human
cases of the disease. Including the latest fatality, there have been
206 deaths globally and 335 confirmed cases since 2003, according to
World Health Organisation data.

Indonesia confirmed Saturday [10 Nov 2007] that a 31-year-old man
from Sumatra island who died last week was infected with bird flu,
raising the toll in the worst-hit nation to 91. Deaths from the H5N1
virus have been steadily rising in archipelagic Indonesia, where the
virus is now endemic across 31 of its 33 provinces. The latest
casualty was the 2nd this month [November 2007]. "Both tests are
positive," Daswir Nurdin, from the ministry's bird flu information
centre, told AFP. Two tests for the H5N1 virus must be returned
positive before someone is confirmed as dying of avian flu here.

Nurdin said that the latest victim died Tuesday [6 Nov 2007] in
Pekanbaru shortly after arriving at its main hospital. He had fallen
sick on 31 Oct 2007 and was admitted to a local hospital 3 days
later. "The number of cases (of bird flu in Indonesia) is 113, of
which 91 have been fatal," he said. Nurdin added that it was unclear
whether the man had come into contact with poultry, the usual method
of transmission of the disease to humans. Many Indonesians keep
chickens or ducks in their backyards.

Azizman Daad from the state general hospital in the province told AFP
that animal health teams from the Agriculture Ministry visited the
area this week but didn't find any sick or dead chickens. However, he
said that an 8-month-old baby living less than one km away was
suspected of bird flu and was now under treatment in the hospital,
after the inspectors found bird nests. "The blood samples of the
birds have been sent to the laboratory, and we are waiting for the
result," he added.

Scientists fear that H5N1 will eventually mutate into a form that is
much more easily transmissible between humans, triggering a global
pandemic. The original source is thought to have been wild migratory
birds. H5N1 has mainly affected Asia and some parts of Africa, but
the Food and Agricultural Organisation warned last month [October
2007] that the virus could be transmitted to poultry in Europe by
ducks and domestic geese seemingly in good health.

Besides Indonesia, deaths have been recorded in Azerbaijan, Cambodia,
China, Egypt, Iraq, Laos, Nigeria, Thailand, Turkey and Viet Nam. The
human outbreaks sparked a drive in recent years to bolster
preparedness for a possible pandemic, including the stockpiling of
antiviral drug treatments, greater vaccine research and advance
emergency planning. There has been a resurgence in recent weeks in
Viet Nam, another of the countries worst hit by bird flu, with a 6th
province reporting deaths in poultry on Thursday [8 Nov 2007]. The
communist nation had managed to control the situation with mass culls
and vaccinations, but it resurfaced in May and October 2007.
Authorities in Indonesia, which reported its 1st human case in 2005,
were initially criticized for being slow to act to curb the virus' spread.
