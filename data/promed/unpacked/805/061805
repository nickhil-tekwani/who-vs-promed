Five people have died from extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis
(XDR TB) in the Eastern Cape, authorities confirmed yesterday, 7 Feb
2007. The provincial health department said that of the 33 patients
diagnosed with the killer strain at the Jose Pearson Hospital in
Bethelsdorp since last October 2006, 5 had died. Jose Pearson houses
about 250 patients from across the province diagnosed with
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB).
At least 303 cases of XDR TB have been recorded in the country since
it was 1st identified last year [2006] at Tugela Ferry Hospital in
KwaZulu Natal. Of the 1st 53 patients diagnosed, 52 died.
Provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said 2 of the Eastern Cape
patients had been from Port Elizabeth -- KwaDwesi and Zwide
respectively -- and the others had been from Humansdorp, Jansenville,
and Mdantsane. Three of the patients died in January 2007, Kupelo said.
"The other 28 patients are kept in isolation and are being treated at
the hospital. Their family members were also screened for XDR TB," Kupelo said.
Although no new TB drugs or diagnostics have been developed in the
past 30 years, the health department is currently importing 2 drugs,
capreomycin and para-amino salicylic acid, to treat MDR and XDR TB.
These drugs were initially taken off the market in the 1980s because
of their severe side effects such as stomach problems, anorexia and
diarrhea. However, they are once again being manufactured
internationally on a limited scale because they are more effective at
treating MDR and XDR than regular TB drugs.
In March 2006, in line with a WHO decision by African health
ministers, a TB Crisis Management Plan was launched by Health
Minister, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang. The plan focuses on 4 districts,
which have a quarter of the national TB caseload. These are Amathole
and Nelson Mandela Bay in the Eastern Cape, eThekwini in KwaZulu
Natal, and the Johannesburg metro in Gauteng. However, despite these
measures, the number of cases remains high, the WHO says.

Two cases of the extensively drug-resistant (XDR TB) have been
identified in the Western Cape. The provincial health department
confirmed that an 11-month-old baby girl was being treated in
Brooklyn Chest TB Hospital. The other patient, a woman from the
Eastern Cape, is being treated in isolation at Lentegeur Hospital.
Last year [2006], over 300 cases of XDR TB were reported across the
country: 263 cases in KwaZulu-Natal, 10 cases each in the Eastern
Cape and the North West, 8 in Gauteng, 6 in Free State, 3 in Limpopo,
and 2 in the Northern Cape. But none were reported in Mpumalanga and
the Western Cape, reports say.

[The presence of XDR TB in an 11-month-old child underscores the
observation that much of the disease is due to acquisition of the
resistant bug, not selection of resistance in a patient non-adherent
to therapy for an initially more sensitive mycobacterium. Young
children with TB usually mean active disease in close family members
or other caretakers.
