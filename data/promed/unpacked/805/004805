New outbreak in the Dales
-------------------------
Foot and mouth disease (FMD) spread to Settle in the Yorkshire Dales
National Park yesterday, an area popular with tourists. The Conservatives
said the fresh outbreak undermined Government claims the epidemic was
under control. A total of 144 cattle and 457 sheep were being destroyed
near the town on 2 holdings at Langcliffe and 1 at Giggleswick.
The outbreaks are about 10 miles away from previously confirmed cases and
they were outside officially designated infected areas. On Thursday the
Ministry of Agriculture had mistakenly reported 1 of the outbreaks as
being in Cumbria.

Maff vets were drawing up a list of "dangerous contact" farms, raising
the prospect of more culls in the National Park in an attempt to stop the
virus spreading farther. The total number of outbreaks in the United
Kingdom rose to 1603, an increase of 4 on the previous day.
Tim Yeo, shadow minister of agriculture, said, "The Settle outbreaks are
worrying, fresh evidence FMD is still spreading to new areas. This casts
doubts on Tony Blair's claim the disease is fully under control."

The National Farmers' Union (NFU) in the North East said, "This is
disastrous for that area which has been free from the disease for the
whole crisis. These outbreaks could have serious consequences for scores
of other farmers on neighboring fell land in the Yorkshire Dales. There
are huge areas of open grazing there."

Nick Brown, minister of agriculture, appealed to Ben Gill, president of
the NFU, last night for more co-operation "to bear down" on the disease
and overcome mounting resistance to official culls. In a letter he
admitted the disease would persist "for some time" and disclosed he was
concerned about the number of cases where farmers were resorting to legal
action to block culls and where authorities were having to obtain legal
powers to carry them out.
He said, "There is no question of denying people fair treatment. This
disease can yet cause considerable problems if we let up on our efforts.
I hope you will join me in urging on the farming community increased
support for our difficult but necessary eradication policies and renewed
vigilance and care in their own conduct, as we hope we are approaching
the end of the epidemic."

Michael Tas, director of Maff's disposal operations, told a meeting of
Dartmoor farmers: "We are still using medireview technology in the 21st
century. We have a lot to learn about safely incinerating animals in the
open. I do not think the arrangement in this area between the Army and
the state veterinary service worked terribly well. There will be a lot of
soul searching done to find out what has happened."
Delays in disposal, which created a backlog of 200 000 carcasses in
Devon, resulted from Maff's tough slaughter deadline. He said: "Maff had
no contingency plans for the size and speed of this outbreak."

He also said a revolutionary method of confirming a case of FMD within 2
or 3 hours, which had been pioneered in America, had not been considered
because Maff did not have the time or the scientists to look at it
properly.

An investigation by Government scientists has found no evidence FMD is
spread by funeral pyres of animal carcasses. Preliminary results of a
joint inquiry by the Institute of Animal Health at Pirbright, Surrey, the
Ministry of Agriculture and the Met Office say it is "highly unlikely"
the virus is spread on thermal air currents from the pyres. The early
results of the investigation, produced by a team of scientists including
Dr Alex Donaldson, the top scientist at Pirbright, after studies of 6
pyres in Devon, Essex and Worcestershire, are published today in The
Veterinary Record, official journal of the British Veterinary
Association.

A senior Ministry of Agriculture official has admitted the government
used "medireview" methods in handling the FMD crisis and Maff had not
prepared contingency plans for an outbreak of the size it faced this
spring. Michael Tas, Maff director of disposal operations, told Devon
farmers pyres of animal carcasses - which were criticized for emitting
potentially carcinogenic chemicals - were badly outdated.
He also admitted a method of confirming a case of FMD within 2 or 3
hours, which had been pioneered in the US, had not been looked at because
Maff did not have the time or the scientists to look at it properly.

His comments came as Maff admitted nearly a third of the animals
slaughtered had later proved negative in tests. The slaughter of these
animals will cost the taxpayer up to BPS 200m in compensation.

Speaking to a group of farmers near Ashburton he said: "The institute of
animal health in Pirbright, Surrey, was having to deal with 60 000
samples a week. They had no space and no time and no spare scientists to
work with the Americans to validate their tests. It is another
unfortunate missed opportunity." Dr Tas is one of Maff's most senior
officials and a regular member of the government committee which handles
the day to day efforts to fight the outbreak.

He had agreed to answer questions about the use of Heathfield landfill
site in Newton Abbot for carcass disposal but he was forced to answer
questions about the whole outbreak. Devon has been 1 of the worst hit
counties and has had 162 cases so far.
Anthony Gibson, regional director of the NFU in the south west, said it
was "entirely correct" that Maff had no plans for the scale and speed of
the outbreak. "The problem was that even after it was pointed out to them
that they were failing to come to terms with it they did nothing about it
until it was very nearly too late. And then when they did finally get
around to tracking the disease properly things got so bad they had to
embark on contiguous culling. It entailed killing tens of thousands of
healthy animals which would have been unnecessary if they had acted with
more urgency from the outset.
We were on to Maff in the second week that they had to bring the army in.
It was ridiculous to expect vets to be building pyres."

Visitor numbers to the UK held up well in March despite FMD, official
figures showed The UK had 1.84m visitors in March 2001, slightly up on
the same month last year when the total was 1.82m, the Office for
National Statistics said. The amount tourists spent rose from BPS 863m in
March 2000 to BPS 890m in March 2001. The British Tourist Authority pointed
out that the figures were based on visitors who departed in March, and
who arrived as the outbreak was beginning to make headlines.

The British epidemic is on the point of becoming the biggest in the
world. Adding the various categories together - animals on infected
farms, neighboring farms and stranded flocks - 3.5m animals have been
slaughtered and another 500 000 are awaiting slaughter. When the damage
to the tourist industry is added, it seems likely foot and mouth could
exceed the cost of BSE (BPS 5bn).

Yesterday's story of nearly 1 out of 3 FMD cases identified by vets not
being subsequently upheld by laboratory tests will reinforce the fears of
some farmers that far too many animals have been slaughtered. The Ministry
of Agriculture (Maff)
understandably ended the system under which the identification of the
disease by a vet had to be verified by laboratory tests before culling
could begin. It was taking up to a week, only fostering the spread of the
disease. But why did Maff not accept the offer of handheld test kits from
the US, which can produce on-the-spot reliable analysis?

Equally important is a review of contiguous culling - the slaughter of
animals on farms adjacent to infectious outbreaks. Many valuable pedigree
herds and flocks were lost in these culls. Was this really necessary?
Thirdly, why was vaccination not used? This will require a deep probe
into farming politics. The National Farmers Union (NFU) resisted the idea
for fear of losing access to European meat markets. But the Netherlands
used vaccination and its export status is being restored. There may be
satisfactory answers to all these questions, but they need to be publicly
and fully set out.

An independent scientific study released Friday supports the British
government's claim that the foot-and-mouth epidemic is under control.
But the hurried slaughter of suspect animals faced new questions as the
government revealed about 30 percent of cases classified as confirmed
produced no indication of the disease in blood tests completed after the
affected livestock had been killed.
The Ministry of Agriculture said about 450 of the 1579 confirmed cases
of the livestock virus proved negative when blood [note: by the context
probably they mean both tests currently used: antigen detecting ELISA on
supernatant from cell cultures from blisters' epithelial tissue and
antibody detecting ELISA on blood samples when the first is not
available - Mod.TG was tested at the Institute for Animal Health
laboratory in Pirbright, southern England.
Of the 250 cases in which animals were slaughtered on suspicion of having
the disease, only 46 -- less than one-fifth [18.4 percent -- tested
positive for the virus.
The ministry said negative results did not necessarily mean foot-and-mouth
was not present on the farms. It was possible the livestock were at the
stage of the disease where it would not show up in blood tests.
More than 2.6 million animals have been slaughtered in a campaign to
eradicate the highly infectious livestock disease. Livestock on infected
farms were ordered killed within 24 hours of the disease being confirmed
at the site. Animals on neighboring farms had to be killed within 2 days.
"Speed of slaughter is crucial to successful control and eradication of
the disease," the ministry said in a written statement. "Waiting for
test results to come through before taking action would risk not bringing
the outbreak under control."
The government policy was bolstered by a report in the journal Nature by
researchers from the Center for Tropical Veterinary Medicine at the
University of Edinburgh. The report says the disease was contained by
the end of March, when restrictions on the movement of livestock, people
and vehicles between farms were in full force.
The researchers used a statistical calculation measuring how many new
cases of the disease each farm was generating. They found the score was
3.3 at the beginning of the epidemic, meaning each case of the disease
was leading to 3 new ones elsewhere.
An epidemic can only be considered under control if the score is less than
one, according to the journal report. That was achieved by 30 Mar 2001,
and the score has been slowly declining since then, according to the
research.
"Any intensification or relaxation of control efforts could greatly
affect the final scale and duration of the epidemic," the researchers
said. The report warned of the need for continued aggressive action to
prevent a resurgence of the livestock disease.
Standard and Poor's credit-rating agency said Friday that the final cost
of the epidemic would amount to $2.6 billion. The cull and related
activities would cost $212 million, with subsidies and tax concessions to
affected businesses likely to add another $1.3 billion.
