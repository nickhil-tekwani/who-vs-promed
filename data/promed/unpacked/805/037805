UNDIAGNOSED DISEASE - INDIA (ORISSA): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

An unknown disease has struck some villages in eastern Indian state
Orissa's Malkangiri district killing at least 16 persons, including 14
children, over the last 10 days, reported the Press Trust of India on
Monday [16 May 2011].

The report quoted medical officers as saying a medical team has
rushed to the area to take stock of the situation. As the victims are
afflicted with lumps on mouth and other parts of the body, the
symptoms indicated that the disease could be anthrax or malnutrition,
according to the report.

The area is inaccessible and the only link to the place is
motor-launch across the Balimela reservoir. In the absence of medical
care in the area, people mostly depend upon 'quacks' and herbal
treatment of diseases, according to the report.

[Anthrax is infrequent in children, even rare, if for no other reason
than that they are rarely occupationally exposed as are adults; note
that 14/16 were children. And "mouth lumps" are not the usual
cutaneous lesion. Oropharyngeal anthrax is severe and usually lethal
for humans but that is not the same as lumps on the mouth. The disease
is regularly seen in humans and cattle in Orissa. Malnutrition would
add to the susceptibility and the probability of butchering a
sick/dead animal with anthrax. But in this instance I must doubt the
validity of the preliminary diagnosis.

Balimela and the Balimela Reservoir can be seen on the

[There is certainly not sufficient clinical information provided in
the brief news description to diagnose the condition affecting this
largely pediatric group and Dr Hugh-Jones' comments above on anthrax
are appreciated.

Using GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease & Epidemiology Network
http://web.gideononline.com), and entering the following criteria:
India / severe (hospitalized, hemorrhagic fever, fatal, etc) / ears,
nose, throat, and oral cavity / oropharyngeal mass/ subcutaneous or
soft tissue lesion(s) or abscess -- melioidosis (infection with
_Burkholderia pseudomallei_) emerges as the leading diagnosis. This
would certainly not be a typical presentation or geographic location,
though it is occasionally seen in India. Lumps in the oropharyngeal
area could be compatible with actinomycosis, but this is not usually
lethal.

Other information regarding these cases, including postmortem
cultures and histopathology would be welcomed. - Mod.LM]
