On 25 May 2001, [ProMED posting 20010525.1025], the moderator requested
data from "systematic studies" of invasive group A streptococcal disease.
My colleagues at the Florida Department of Health and the University of
South Florida College of Public Health and I recently examined the
descriptive and clinical epidemiology of invasive group A streptococcal
infections (IGASI) in the state of Florida (population in 2000: 15 982 378)
[1,2].
IGASI became a reportable condition in Florida in the summer of 1996. The
cases that were included in our retrospective cohort study were 257
patients who were hospitalized for IGASI throughout Florida between August
of 1996 and August of 2000 [1].
The crude incidence of IGASI steadily increased from 0.34 cases per 100 000
in 1997 to 0.97 cases per 100 000 in 2000 [2]. This increase may be largely
due to improved reporting by physicians and laboratories. This relatively
large study detected a hospital mortality rate of 18 per cent (41/228) [1].
After adjusting for several confounders, treatment with clindamycin
strongly protected against mortality in patients who had necrotizing
fasciitis but did not protect against mortality in patients who did not
develop necrotizing fasciitis [1]. Black patients appeared to have less
severe disease than did white patients [2,3].
