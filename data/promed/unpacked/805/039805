There has been a rare hepatitis A death in Victoria as the state experiences a spreading outbreak of the very infectious disease.

Victorian's deputy health officer Dr Brett Sutton confirmed a man recently died from locally acquired case of hepatitis A, a viral infection of the liver.

There have been 42 confirmed cases of the disease in the past 2 months in Victoria, with another 23 still being confirmed. The health department said all those affected so far are men, many who are gay or bisexual, or injecting drug users. Dr Sutton has urged those at risk of infection to get a free vaccine.

It follows an unusual increase in hepatitis A cases in Europe and North America that has affected hundreds of people, mostly men who have sex with men, in recent years [although a number of large outbreaks in the USA are not primarily related to the MSM community - Mod.LL].

The outbreak has been complicated because of a shortage of hepatitis A vaccines in some countries.

Marcus Chen, from the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, said the centre starting encouraging at-risk people to have vaccinations last August 2017, anticipating that the European outbreak would eventually hit locally. Adjunct Associate Professor Chen said some people with hepatitis A could be so sick they needed hospitalization. "With hepatitis A people can feel unwell with nausea and fever. Then they typically become jaundiced, so they get yellow eyes and skin and dark urine," he said. [The high hospitalization rate in the USA outbreaks in California and Michigan were in part due to the cohort population of homeless individuals - Mod.LL]

Hepatitis A can be spread through traces of faeces, including through the contamination of food and water. It can also be spread through sex and sharing needles.

Deaths from hepatitis A in Australia are very unusual, and no one died in Victoria from the disease in 2017. However approximately 2 per cent of cases are thought to be fatal, as hepatitis A can result in liver failure, with risk increasing with age.

Victorian men who have sex with men and people who have injected drugs in the past 12 months are now being offered a free vaccine.
"We're beginning to see spread of the infection more widely," said Dr Sutton. "This death highlights just how important it is for all eligible people to get the free hepatitis vaccine."

He said it was also important that people washed their hands and body after sex to help stop the spread of hepatitis A. "Make sure you're using condoms and changing condoms between any sexual activity," Dr Sutton said. "We also strongly advise any confirmed cases with hepatitis A against engaging in any sexual activity or food preparation that could increase the spread of the virus."

The free vaccine program will run until [Mon 31 Dec 2018].

[Because of specific sexual practices, men who have sex with men (MSM) are known to have a higher risk of acquiring hepatitis A and, if not vaccinated in childhood, should be immunized if found to be anti-HAV negative.

In an Italian study (Bordi L, Rozera G, Scognamiglio P, et al. Monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A involving HIV-infected men who have sex with men, Rome, Italy 2008-2009. J Clin Virol. 2012; 54(1): 26-9, abstract available at http://www.journalofclinicalvirology.com/article/S1386-6532(12)00015-7/abstract), a large and long-lasting (18 months or longer) monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A is reported in the Rome metropolitan area (at least since July 2008), involving a high proportion of HIV-infected MSM. All the infections detected in MSM were attributable to a monophyletic strain of HAV, circulating also in other parts of Europe around the same period. Outbreaks like this can take place despite circulation of heterologous HAV strains in the general population.

The recommendations for HAV vaccination in susceptible adults from the United States' Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] are to vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and people with any of the following indications:
- men who have sex with men;
- people who use injected or non-injected illicit drugs;
- people working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting;
- people with chronic liver disease and people who receive clotting factor concentrates;
- people traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and
- unvaccinated people who anticipate close personal contact (such as household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the 1st 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A. The 1st dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee.
