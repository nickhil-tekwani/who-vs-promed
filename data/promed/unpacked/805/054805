REOVIRUS INFECTION, BUDGERIGARS - UK: SUSPECTED
***********************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>
ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases
<http://www.isid.org>
[In June 2003, ProMED-mail reported about an outbreak of a fatal infectious
disease in budgerigars in the UK. Allegedly, the outbreak had started
several months earlier, but reporting by breeders was deficient. The most
prominent postmortem lesions, according to early reports by the Veterinary
Science Division of the Scottish Agricultural College, were hepato- and
splenomegaly. The Budgerigars Society took precautionary measures,
including the cancellation of several events, to prevent the further spread
of infection. Initially, a paramyxovirus infection was suspected; since
September 2003, laboratory investigations concentrated around a possible
(hitherto undefined) reovirus infection, but the findings were not
conclusive. Submissions of suspected material to the laboratories were
sporadic and insufficient. Since it seems that the said syndrome has not
disappeared, we find it appropriate to provide readers with the following
update. - Mod.AS]

Update on budgerigar mortality
------------------------------
Since the end of March 2003, 7 submissions from budgerigars consisting of
about 20 samples have been received by the Avian Virology Unit at the
Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), Weybridge for virological
examination. The samples have been examined using direct electron
microscopy (EM), virus isolation in embryonated hens eggs and cell
cultures, and molecular analysis. No evidence for the presence of
paramyxovius type 5 virus in any of the samples was obtained. Inoculation
and passage in a variety of avian and mammalian cell cultures has revealed
the presence of reovirus-like agents in 9 of 14 samples of intestine and
liver material.
Unusually, the viruses grow better in mammalian cells (BHK-21) than in
avian cells. Similar reovirus-like particles have also been detected on 2
occasions by direct EM examination of samples of gut. A further 6 samples
are still being examined for the presence of viruses. At this stage of the
investigation the aetiological significance of the reovirus-like agents is
unclear and further studies are in progress to compare the budgerigar
isolates with other avian reoviruses, particularly those from psittacine
species.
Reoviruses have been associated with hepatitis, diarrhoea, and mortality in
several species of parrots, in particular grey parrots, but we are not
aware of any reports describing the presence of reovirus-like agents in
budgerigars.
[The next quarterly VLA Avian Surveillance Report (2003; 7(4): Oct­Dec)
contained one reference to the said issue: "one reovirus was isolated from
budgerigar
tissues".<http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/vla/science/documents/science-end-survrep-qtlya404.pdf>

Findlay, on 29 Feb 2004, is copied from the Society's website:]

Another confirmed case
----------------------
I write to advise that another case of Reovirus has been confirmed by Dr
Baker and Ruth Manville. This case is in a Members Stud in the South
Northants Area and the member has lost over 50 per cent of his Stud. Once
again, new birds had been introduced and the original Guidelines were not
followed and with no proper quarantine carried out.
While this is the 4th confirmed case since mid-November 2003 it is
important to remind those fanciers you come into contact with that the
Spring Event in Doncaster on 24-25 Apr 2004 is going ahead.
