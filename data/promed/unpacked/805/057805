Avian Influenza's Human-attack Pathway Revealed
-----------------------------------------------
2 separate research groups have independently discovered why the H5N1 avian
influenza virus causes lethal pneumonia in people, but is -- so far -- hard
for people to catch. In the process, they have found a way to predict which
mutations might make the virus more contagious and potentially become a
pandemic strain. To date, confirmed human deaths from the disease stand at
103 worldwide.
The H5N1 virus binds to sugars on the surface of cells deep in human lungs,
but not to cells lining the human nose and throat, report the 2 research
teams led by Thijs Kuiken at Erasmus University in Rotterdam and Yoshihiro
Kawaoka at the Universities of Tokyo, Japan and Wisconsin at Madison, US.
This fits the few autopsies that have been performed on H5N1 victims, who
had damage to the alveoli, the delicate sacs deep in the lungs where oxygen
enters the blood. Influenza normally travels between people by being
sneezed out and breathed in through the nose and throat. Both groups
concluded that poor binding of the H5N1 high in the respiratory tract might
be why the virus has so far not been able to spread easily between people,
a major factor keeping it from becoming pandemic.
The Wisconsin team used lectins -- plant molecules that bind to the same
complex sugars on the cell surface where the flu virus attaches to cells --
to identify how different versions of the sugar molecule vary in humans.
They used one lectin specific to the "2,3 form" of the sugar common in
birds, which H5N1 is known to prefer, and another specific to the "2,6
form" more common in people. Testing tissue slices from the human
respiratory tract, they found that 2,6 receptors were common in the nose
and throat, but 2,3 receptors -- H5N1's preferred site -- were common in
the alveoli. The Dutch group used the killed H5N1 virus itself and saw the
same pattern as the Wisconsin team, with binding in the deep lungs but not
the nose and throat.
Both groups found these receptors, or viral binding, especially in cells
called type 2 alveolar cells. These actively dividing cells repair and
maintain the tiny lung sacs, so H5N1's binding of these particular cells
might explain why H5N1 pneumonia is so severe. The virus can also hijack
the machinery it needs to replicate more easily in these active cells than
in neighboring, non-dividing cells. The Dutch team also found binding to
alveolar macrophages, white blood cells which can trigger the inflammatory
immune reaction, which often kills in pneumonia cases. Their technique
might allow scientists to predict what H5N1 could do next. "We will now try
to look at what mutations in the virus improve binding in the upper
respiratory tract," Kuiken told New Scientist. That could show what
mutations to watch for as H5N1 continues to spread around the globe. They
will also study which other human tissues H5N1 can bind to. Cases so far
suggest it might affect the gut and most worrying, the brain.

The Nature paper is entitled "Avian influenza virus receptors in the human
airway" by Kyoko Shinya, Masahito Ebina, Shinya Yamada, Masao Ono, Noriyuki
Kasai and Yoshihiro Kawaoka. The introductory paragraph reads: "Although
more than 100 people have been infected by H5N1 influenza A viruses,
human-to-human transmission is rare. What are the molecular barriers
limiting human-to-human transmission? Here, we demonstrate an anatomical
difference in the distribution in the human airway of the different binding
molecules preferred by the avian and human influenza viruses. The
respective molecules are sialic acid linked to galactose by an alpha-2,3
linkage (SAalpha2,3Gal) and by an alpha-2,6 linkage (SAalpha2,6Gal). Our
findings may provide a rational explanation for why H5N1 viruses at present
rarely infect and spread between humans, although they can replicate
efficiently in the lungs."
The Editor of Nature comments that: "Thankfully, there have been no reports
of human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The
existence of a molecular barrier that may contribute to this situation has
now been confirmed in patients. The key is the distribution in the human
airway of the different receptors preferred by avian and human derived
viruses. The bird virus binds preferentially to binding molecules that are
common in the lower respiratory tract but are less well represented in the
upper respiratory tract. As a result, the virus is not readily spread by
droplet infection or cough." - Mod.CP]
