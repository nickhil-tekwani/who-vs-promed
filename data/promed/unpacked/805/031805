Local animal health workers in Ca Mau City in the Mekong Delta Province of
Ca Mau on Thu [11 Oct 2007] destroyed 9 pigs infected by pig disease to
prevent its outbreak in the city and surrounding areas.

Over the last 3 weeks, local animal health workers in Ca Mau City culled 56
sick animals and collected blood samples for testing.

Medically called porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), this
blue ear disease 1st struck the central provinces of Quang Nam, Quang Ngai
and Da Nang City in late June [2007]. The disease then broke out in the
Mekong Delta Province of Long An in late July 2007. Local veterinarians
have destroyed 32 out of 40 infected pigs on a farm in Can Giuoc District.

In the past 2 days, local veterinarians in Khanh Hoa Province's districts
of Dien Khanh, Cam Lam, and Ninh Hoa and Nha Trang City culled 270 pigs
infected by the disease.

As of 11 Oct 2007, Khanh Hoa [central area], Ca Mau [southern area] and
Lang Son [northern area] provinces were reportedly still trying to control
the disease. [For the location of the above provinces in the respective 3
area maps, see <http://www.angelfire.com/co/hongnam/vnmap.html>. - Mod.AS]

ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall

[The spread of the PRRS virus into the above 3 provinces was reported in
posting 20070927.3203. In the said posting, ProMED-mail requested
information on the results of the investigation concerning the Vietnamese
PRRSV, carried out in the USA (reportedly at NVSL, FADDL, Plum Island, NY),
pertaining to the virus' pathogenicity and, if possible, on the rate of its
similarity to the Chinese strain.

In view of the potential international impact of the spreading virus, the
request is hereby repeated.

It will also be useful to obtain information on the PRRS situation in
Myanmar, into which -- according to unconfirmed media reports -- the
pathogenic virus has spread after seriously affecting China and Viet Nam. -
