The Agriculture ministry has sounded the alarm over a maize disease in the South Rift that could threaten food security. Most farmers in the region, the country's grain basket, have been affected.

Rift Valley director of agriculture Philip Ochieng said 30 to 40 percent of the maize in the South Rift had been lost to the disease. "Samples have been analysed locally and abroad, and the results indicate a combination of pathogens, mainly viruses and fungi," he said.

Permanent secretary Romano Kiome said symptoms of the disease were mottling, flecking and streaking. Fungal symptoms like chlorosis, necrosis, leaf reddening, discolouration of nodes and brownish-white mould growth on cobs had also been noted. The situation had been worsened by moisture stress, poor soil fertility and heavy infestation of pests such as thrips, aphids, leaf hoppers, and stock borers. He noted that the region was critical to food security.

Dr Kiome said a team comprising the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service, agro-chemical firms, Egerton University, Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, and the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Centre had been set up to curb further losses. He said besides the Rift region, areas [in Eastern Province] had [also] been affected.

He said experts had recommended short-term measures including timely planting to avoid drought stress, use of certified seed, crop rotation, diversification of farms and avoiding planting maize in fields that are prone to water logging. Long-term measures included research on identifying the causal organism, updating the early warning system, screening a wide range of maize germplasm to identify resistance [and] developing disease-resistant seed.

[So far, the presence of a number of pathogens in the diseased maize in Kenya have been reported by various sources, including _Botrytis cinerea_ (grey mould, ear rot), root knot nematodes (_Meloidogyne_ species) and cephalosporium leaf stripe (ProMED-mail posts 20120117.0114 & 20120326.0703). In addition, a range of fungi and viruses, as well as other maize pathogens, are known to be present in the region, including, for example, _Maize dwarf mosaic virus_, _Maize streak virus_, and _Maize rough dwarf virus_, which was reported for the 1st time in Kenya from the Western Province in 2011 (ProMED-mail post 20110204.0407).

Therefore, the suggestion above that a combination of pathogens may cause the problems in the maize certainly appears the most likely situation. Further work is obviously needed to identify the cause, and a collaboration between the various organisations mentioned is a promising option. Given the as yet uncertain diagnosis, the intermediate disease management measures listed in this report would cover a wide range of pathogens as well as improve general crop health and quality.
