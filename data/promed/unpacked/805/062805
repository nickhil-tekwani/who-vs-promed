Police hunt for dealer of cyanide-laced heroin
-----------------------------------------------
Police in Easton, PA have issued an arrest warrant for the man they believe
sold cyanide-laced heroin to at least 6 people who later wound up
hospitalized after taking the drug. The 6 people checked into a pair of
New Jersey hospitals over the weekend after buying the heroin in Easton and
later ingesting it. 3 men wound up at Warren Hospital and another 3 were
taken to an undisclosed hospital in Monmouth County, police said.
Lt. Sam Lobb said it is uncommon to run into bad batches of heroin. Police
do not believe the heroin was cut with cyanide -- the main ingredient in
rat poison -- on purpose but will explore several possibilities, including
the prospect that someone mixed in the poison in an effort to kill junkies.
"I guess there are many possibilities out there as to why someone would do
this," Lobb said. "I don't know why someone would do that. If you're a drug
dealer you don't want to kill off your customers."
Police were tipped off about the bad heroin by Newark's New Jersey Poison
Control Center, which told police the users reportedly ingested
cyanide-tainted heroin. After talking to the victims, police seized about
30 bags of suspected heroin with a street value of about $600 from a home.
No one was at the apartment when police arrived.
State police will test the suspected heroin taken from the home to
determine if the substance is in fact mixed with cyanide, Lobb said.
Even if there are potentially lethal batches of heroin circulating on the
street, that will not likely deter hard-core users, said Gail Lutsky, a
drug and alcohol counselor for more than 25 years. "Most people will
think it was just a mistake, that someone cut it wrong," she said. "When
you have bad dope, usually it's too potent; it's not cut with poison. What
happens is people take the same amount (of the potent batch) and overdose."
Lutsky said if heroin users hear about the cyanide-laced batch, it will not
likely curtail their thirst for the drug because many addicts consider the
risk of ingesting bad heroin less severe than the pains of
withdrawal. "Even if a junkie knows it's bad, they'll talk themselves into
taking it anyway," she continued.
"Addicts don't want to go through the withdrawal," said Lutsky, clinical
coordinator at Lehigh Valley Hospital Muhlenberg. Lutsky said she finds
the possibility of a vigilante drug dealer bent on killing junkies "really
remote." She said the mixing of the cyanide and heroin was probably an
accident.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health (PADOH), and the Philadelphia
Department of Public Health (PDPH) are releasing the following information
regarding probable Cyanide intoxication in heroin users.
The New Jersey Poison Control Center has reported 7 cases of probable
cyanide intoxication in heroin users who are currently hospitalized in 3
different healthcare facilities in central New Jersey.
The first case presented early on 29 Jan [2005], and the most recent case
was admitted early on 30 Jan [2005]. All reported nasally insufflating
heroin. One presented with a lactic acidosis and hypotension and was found
to have an elevated pVO2, the rest presented with nausea, headache, low
potassium and elevated pVO2. The venous blood specimens appeared to be
arterial although 2 had blood drawn from central venous lines, confirmed by
pressure and radiography. The illness is also characterized by agitation,
tachypneia, and tachycardia. Venous blood from these case patients has the
characteristic appearance of oxygenated blood.
3 of the 6 received thiosulfate infusions and transiently improved; they
rebounded and then all received sodium nitrite after which their pVO2
levels dropped to within the normal range. Rebound was seen in 2 of the
patients with pVO2 again over 100.
The source of the heroin has at this time been reported only as from
dealers in Easton, PA and Asbury Park, NJ. Laboratory confirmation of
cyanide in clinical specimens is pending. Criminal and public health
investigations are in progress and the presence of cyanide has not yet been
established in heroin used by the case patients. The source of this
heroin, and the extent of its distribution are unknown at this time.
Clinicians and emergency medical responders caring for individuals with
similar illness and recent history of heroin abuse should consider cyanide
intoxication, and initiate empiric therapy if their diagnostic evaluation
suggests this diagnosis.
Information about cyanide is available at
, and at
. Contact the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222
for additional information regarding the diagnosis or treatment of cyanide
poisoning.

[Cyanide attaches itself to ubiquitous metalloenzymes and renders them
inactive. Its principal toxicity probably results from inactivation of
cytochrome oxidase and, thus, cellular respiration, even in the presence of
adequate oxygen stores. The arterial oxygen is therefore not removed and
the venous oxygen concentration rises. As a result, the tissues with the
highest oxygen requirements (such as brain, heart, liver) are the most
profoundly affected by acute cyanide poisoning.
Apparently, the cases were seen between 29 and 30 Jan 2005 and all were
using heroin intranasally. The 1st case presented early on Jan 29, and the
most recent case was admitted early on Jan 30. One had lactic acidosis,
hypotension, and an elevated venous pO2, the others had with nausea,
headache, low potassium, and elevated venous pO2. The illness is also
characterized by agitation and rapid cardiac and respiratory rates. Venous
blood from patients has the characteristic appearance of oxygenated blood.
