Stripe rust outbreak
--------------------
DPI [Department of Primary Industries] said an outbreak of stripe
rust on grain crops in northeastern Victoria had the potential to
heavily impact the volume of yields. Initial reports of the disease
date back to July [2008] in the region, with crops in Cobram the most
severely affected.

DPI plant pathologist Frank Henry said most wheat varieties in the
northeast were being affected to some extent, but there had been no
confirmation about which types of stripe rust were involved. "There
is a lot of stripe rust inoculum in the system as there was a
significant green bridge for it to inhabit," Mr Henry said.
"Conditions in Victoria are becoming ideal for stripe rust, which is
why we're beginning to see it. Growers should be diligent in
monitoring their crops for signs of stripe rust from this point forward."

While unsure of just how badly the northeastern region has been
affected by the disease, Mr Henry has major concerns. "I'd say it
would be fairly severe, but it depends on how good the control
strategies are," he said. For fungicides to be most effective against
stripe rust, they have to be applied before it's known whether or not
crops are going to respond. With spring now upon us, this time of the
year is critical in controlling any outbreak of stripe rust, with the
disease most active in the September to November period.

[Wheat stripe rust (also called yellow rust) is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_ and occurs worldwide mostly
in cooler climates. It causes yellow leaf stripes, stunting of
plants, and reduces grain production with yield losses of 40 to 100
percent. It affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a
number of grass species. Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles
during the cropping season. The fungus needs living plants to survive
between seasons. Grasses and volunteer wheat may generate a "green
bridge" providing inoculum to infect new crops. Disease management
strategies include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide
applications, and control of volunteer wheat.

Outbreaks of the disease were reported earlier this year (2008) in
New South Wales and Queensland, and a new very virulent strain
affected wheat crops in South Australia in 2007. Pathogen strains in
Australia are being monitored annually since 1973, and several
pathotypes exist. For more information on the disease please see
