Flu pandemic much milder than expected
--------------------------------------
As federal health agencies launch a big campaign to convince more
Americans to get flu shots, new data from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) and outside analysts indicate this
pandemic [influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection] is much
milder than officials expected or have let on so far. "It is probably
going to be the mildest pandemic on record compared to the three that
happened in the 20th century," says Dr Marc Lipsitch, a professor of
epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health and co-author of
a new analysis in the journal Public Library of Science.

There are a number of ways to measure how severe -- or mild -- a flu
pandemic is. One way is to look at the proportion of the population
that gets sick. The season isn't over yet, but so far it's been less
than 8 percent. Lipsitch says assuming the virus doesn't change, it's
reasonable to expect that between 10 percent and 20 percent of the
population will become sick from it. "[That's] toward the upper end
of a typical flu season," he says, but still not as bad as was anticipated.

Another measure is the number of people who get sick enough to
require hospital care. Lipsitch says if 15 percent of Americans get
this flu, "then we would expect from about 70 000 up to over 600 000
hospitalizations." He says the figure will probably end up somewhere
in the middle, about where we'd be in a typical flu season.

The most important measure is how many people die. Last spring
[2009], experts thought it was entirely possible swine flu [influenza
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection] would kill 1 out of every 100
people who got the virus. "We now know that's at least 20-fold too
high and probably more than 20-fold too high," he says. In fact, the
death rate from swine flu so far has actually been less than the
death rate during the average flu season. It's around 1 out of every
2000 who've gotten sick, perhaps fewer.

The big difference this year [2009] is that most of those deaths have
been among children, teenagers, and adults under age 50. Flu
typically kills mostly people over 65. But that's not because this
flu is more severe among children and young adults, as many think.
It's simply because many more young people are getting the flu than
usual. "And what you find is that the pandemic is making more kids
sick. But it's killing a smaller percentage of the kids it makes sick
than it is of the adults and seniors it makes sick," says Peter
Sandman, an expert in risk communication. He says the CDC has been
reluctant to acknowledge that swine flu has been much milder than
expected. "The CDC may be thinking, you know, 'There are already
millions of people who plan not to get vaccinated because they think
the pandemic is mild, and if we announce as the official health
agency of the US government that the pandemic is mild, than even
fewer people will get vaccinated and some of those people will die,'" he says.

Not so, says the head of the CDC, Dr Thomas Frieden. "I think we've
been completely transparent with what we think is happening. I think
we have a difference of opinion on whether that is mild or severe,"
he says. He points out that the CDC has counted more than 250 deaths
among children. "Any flu season that kills at least 3 times more
children than a usual flu season I think it would be very misleading
to describe that as mild," he says. But Frieden agrees that
perception is what matters. The more that people think the pandemic
threat is over, the fewer who will get vaccinated. Experts worry that
could increase the chance of a 3rd wave of swine flu early next year [2010].

Summary
-------
"Every winter, millions of people catch influenza -- a viral
infection of the airways -- and about half a million people die as a
result. In the US alone, an average of 36 000 people are thought to
die from influenza-related causes every year. These seasonal
epidemics occur because small but frequent changes in the virus mean
that an immune response produced one year provides only partial
protection against influenza the next year. Occasionally, influenza
viruses emerge that are very different and to which human populations
have virtually no immunity. These viruses can start global epidemics
(pandemics) that kill millions of people. Experts have been warning
for some time that an influenza pandemic was long overdue and in,
March 2009, the 1st cases of influenza caused by a new virus called
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (pH1N1; swine flu) occurred in Mexico. The virus
spread rapidly and on 11 Jun 2009, the World Health Organization
declared that a global pandemic of pH1N1 influenza was underway. By
the beginning of November 2009, more than 6000 people had died from
pH1N1 influenza.

With the onset of autumn -- drier weather and the return of children
to school help the influenza virus to spread -- pH1N1 [pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus] cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the
Northern Hemisphere have greatly increased. Although public-health
officials have been preparing for this resurgence of infection, they
cannot be sure of its impact on human health without knowing more
about the severity of pH1N1 infections. The severity of an infection
can be expressed as a case-fatality ratio (CFR; the proportion of
cases that result in death), as a case-hospitalization ratio (CHR;
the proportion of cases that result in hospitalization), and as a
case-intensive care ratio (CIR; the proportion of cases that require
treatment in an intensive care unit). Because so many people have
been infected with pH1N1 since it emerged, the numbers of cases and
deaths caused by pH1N1 infection are not known accurately so these
ratios cannot be easily calculated. In this study, the researchers
estimate the severity of pH1N1 influenza in the US between April and
July 2009 by combining data on pH1N1 infections from several sources
using a statistical approach known as Bayesian evidence synthesis.

By using data on medically attended and hospitalized cases of pH1N1
infection in Milwaukee and information from New York City on
hospitalizations, intensive care use, and deaths, the researchers
estimate that the proportion of US cases with symptoms that died (the
sCFR) during summer 2009 was 0.048 percent. That is, about 1 in 2000
people who had symptoms of pH1N1 infection died. The "credible
interval" for this sCFR, the range of values between which the "true"
sCFR is likely to lie, they report, is 0.026 percent to 0.096 percent
(between 1 in 4000 and 1 in 1000 deaths for every symptomatic case).
About 1 in 400 symptomatic cases required treatment in intensive
care, they estimate, and about 1 in 70 symptomatic cases required
hospital admission. When the researchers used a different approach to
estimate the total number of symptomatic cases -- based on New
Yorkers' self-reported incidence of influenza-like-illness from a
telephone survey -- their estimates of pH1N1 infection severity were
7 to 9-fold lower. Finally, they report that the sCFR and the sCIR
were highest in people aged 18 or older and lowest in children aged 5-17 years.

Many uncertainties (for example, imperfect detection and reporting)
can affect estimates of influenza severity. Even so, the findings of
this study suggest that an autumn-winter pandemic wave of pH1N1 will
have a death toll only slightly higher than or considerably lower
than that caused by seasonal influenza in an average year, provided
pH1N1 continues to behave as it did during the summer. Similarly, the
estimated burden on hospitals and intensive care facilities ranges
from somewhat higher than in a normal influenza season to
considerably lower. The findings of this study also suggest that,
unlike seasonal influenza, which kills mainly elderly adults, a high
proportion of deaths from pH1N1 infection will occur in non elderly
adults, a shift in age distribution that has been seen in previous
pandemics. With these estimates in hand and with continued close
monitoring of the pandemic, public-health officials should now be in
a better position to plan effective strategies to deal with the pH1N1
pandemic."
