----------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2018, there were 919 cases of infectious syphilis (that is, primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis) reported in British Columbia (18.4 per 100 000), an increase of 35% from 2017 (n=683). From 1 Jan to 30 Sep 2019, there were 821 infectious syphilis cases reported. Based on this, we project there will be 1095 cases of infectious syphilis reported in 2019 in British Columbia (projected rate, 21.7 per 100 000).

While the majority of cases of infectious syphilis are among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, the number of infectious syphilis cases among females has been increasing from 35 in 2017 (1.4 per 100 000) to 53 in 2018 (2.1 per 100 000), and is projected to increase further to 75 in 2019 (projected rate, 2.9 per 100 000). There have been 2 cases of congenital syphilis reported in British Columbia in 2019. These represent the 1st cases of congenital syphilis reported in British Columbia since 2013.

In response to the increase in syphilis rates and the reported cases of congenital syphilis in British Columbia, all pregnant individuals are recommended to be screened for syphilis at the time of delivery. This recommendation is in addition to the current practice of testing all pregnant individuals at their 1st prenatal visit (http://www.perinatalservicesbc.ca/about/news-stories/stories/new-recommendations-for-syphilis-screening). British Columbia is also working to refresh its action plan to prevent and control syphilis. The 1st syphilis action plan was developed in January 2016 (http://www.bccdc.ca/resource-gallery/Documents/Statistics%20and%20Research/Statistics%20and%20Reports/STI/Syphilis%20Action%20Plan.pdf).
