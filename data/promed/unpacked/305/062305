Situation summary in the Americas
---------------------------------
In 2021, 4 countries in the Region of the Americas (Bolivia, Brazil, Peru, and Venezuela) have reported confirmed yellow fever cases. In 2020, 2 countries in the Region of the Americas reported confirmed cases of yellow fever: Brazil and Peru.

A situation summary of the countries that have reported confirmed yellow fever cases in 2021 is provided below.

In Brazil, a re-emergence of the yellow fever virus has been reported in the extra-Amazonian region since 2014. The expansion of the historical area of yellow fever transmission to areas previously considered not at-risk led to 2 waves of transmission, one during the 2016-2017 seasonal period, with 778 confirmed human cases including 262 deaths, and another during the 2017-2018 seasonal period, with 1376 confirmed human cases including 483 deaths. As a result, since 2020, Brazil has changed its recommended areas for yellow fever vaccination to include the entire country.

During the 2020-2021 seasonal period, between July 2020 and June 2021, a total of 527 suspected human cases of yellow fever were reported, of which 9 (1.7%) were confirmed, 13 (2.5%) remain under investigation, and 500 (94.9%) were discarded. All of the confirmed cases, including 3 fatal cases, were reported in the state of Santa Catarina. Among the total confirmed cases, ages ranged from 18 to 67 years, and 8 of the confirmed cases had no yellow fever vaccination history or an unknown vaccination history.

Between 1 Jul and 23 Dec 2021, a total of 103 suspected human cases of yellow fever were reported, of which one was confirmed in the state of Pará, and 35 remain under investigation. The confirmed case was reported on 21 Jul 2021 in a 21 year old male resident of Afua Municipality, Pará State.

The number of cases reported in the 2020-2021 seasonal period is significantly lower than the total number of cases observed in each of the 2 previous periods, when the numbers of cases exceeded the seasonal records set several decades prior. In November 2020, a new transmission corridor was reported in the Southern Region, with epizootics reported among non-human primates (NHP) in the state of Paraná and Santa Catarina, following a route towards Rio Grande do Sul State and with the possibility of reaching bordering countries such as Argentina and Paraguay.

After an increased transmission of yellow fever in Santa Catarina in December 2020, the border state of Rio Grande do Sul was affected since January 2021. The ecological corridor model used during the 2016-2018 outbreak was updated, and thus, new routes and municipalities were defined as priorities for surveillance and immunization activities.

Confirmed yellow fever epizootics in the Central-West Region as of September 2020 alerted authorities to the risk of spread to new areas. Genomic studies indicated a different lineage of the virus from the one that re-emerged in the extra-Amazon Region as of 2014 and which caused the outbreaks in the Southeast and South regions in recent years. This finding indicated a new introduction of the virus from the Amazon Region (endemic).

In the 2020-2021 seasonal period, most of the confirmed epizootics (88%) were reported in the South Region of the country (191/218), followed by the Central-West Region (24/218), the Southeast Region (2/218), and the North Region (1/218). In March 2021, an epizootic of yellow fever among NHP was confirmed in the state of Acre.

Between 1 Jul and 28 Dec 2021, a total of 276 epizootics were reported among NHP, of which 13 were confirmed for yellow fever and 10 remain under investigation. Confirmed epizootics were reported in the states of Minas Gerais and Santa Catarina.

In Peru, between epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 49 of 2021, a total of 18 cases of yellow fever were reported, of which 10 were confirmed and 8 probable cases remain under investigation. The number of probable cases reported in 2021 as of EW 49 is greater than the number of probable cases reported annually during the past 4 years (2017-2020).

Of the 18 cases reported as of EW 49 of 2021, 77% (14/18) are male, 42% are young adults between 18 and 57 years old, and none had a history of yellow fever vaccination. The cases were reported from the departments.

Of the 18 cases reported as of EW 49 of 2021, 77% (14/18) are male, 42% are young adults between 18 and 57 years old, and none had a history of yellow fever vaccination. The cases were reported from the departments of Loreto (6 cases), Puno (5 cases), Ucayali (4 cases), and San Martín (3 cases).

In addition, 7 deaths were reported among the cases in the departments of Puno (4 deaths), San Martín (2 deaths), and Loreto (1 death).

In the last 6 years (2016 until EW 49 of 2021), a cumulative total of 113 yellow fever cases, including 42 deaths, were reported in Peru. Of the total cases, 41 were confirmed and one was classified as probable.

In Venezuela, between EW 39 and EW 49 of 2021, a total of 11 confirmed human cases of yellow fever were reported in the state of Monagas, all laboratory confirmed. Of the total, 5 were asymptomatic and 6 developed signs and symptoms. The probable site of infection for 10 of the confirmed cases was Maturín Municipality, and Punceres Municipality for one confirmed case. Of the confirmed cases, 9 are male with ages ranging from 24 to 82 years, and 9 had no history of yellow fever vaccination. To date, no deaths have been reported among the confirmed cases (Figure 1).

In addition, between EW 32 and EW 49 of 2021, a total of 13 epizootics of yellow fever among NHP were reported in Venezuela -- 10 in Monagas State and 3 in Anzoátegui State. Of the epizootics, 2 reported in Monagas State were laboratory-confirmed for yellow fever at the national reference laboratory and 11 were confirmed for yellow fever by epidemiological link. Confirmed yellow fever epizootics were reported in the municipalities of Maturin (7), Aguasay (2), Punceres (1) in Monagas State and the municipality of Freites (3) in Anzoátegui State.

Advice for national authorities
-------------------------------
The Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) encourages member states with areas at-risk for yellow fever to continue their efforts to immunize the at-risk populations and to take the necessary actions to keep travelers informed and vaccinated prior to traveling to areas where yellow fever vaccination is recommended.

Recommendations for international travelers regarding yellow fever vaccination are available at http://www.who.int/ith/en/.

The guidelines pertaining to laboratory diagnosis and vaccinations are the same as those published in the 7 Dec 2018 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on Yellow Fever.

[The risk of human yellow fever virus infections has expanded from its traditional localities to new corridors of transmission in Brazil. Although these human YF cases are the result of spill-over from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle the risk remains that infected individuals could carry the virus into more urban or periurban settings where the urban vector, _Aedes aegypti_, is abundant and initiate outbreaks of this disease. The challenge is maintenance of 80% immunity of the population through ongoing vaccination in remote rural areas where individuals are likely to be in contact with forest ecosystems.

Yellow fever is not only a public health risk. As Mod.PMB noted earlier in ProMED post 20211005.8698865, it is also a concern for conservation of non-human primates that are endangered or threatened with extinction, such as brown howler monkeys (_Alouatta guariba_) and golden lion tamarins (_Leontopithecus rosalia_), that experience high case fatality rates when infected by YF virus. As mentioned in earlier posts, the greatest risk for YF adverse population effects is the muriqui monkey, Brazil's largest primate and one of the planet's 25 most endangered species of primates. There are 2 species of muriqui monkey in Brazil: the northern muriqui (_Brachyteles hypoxanthus_) that has been on the IUCN's (International Union for Conservation of Nature) critically endangered list for more than 25 years, and the southern muriqui (_Brachyteles arachnoides_), which has been placed on that list more recently. The previous report indicates that brown howler monkeys (_Alouatta guariba_) and masked titis (_Callicebus personatus_) are the non-human primates most affected in this YF outbreak. However, the buffy-headed marmoset (_Callithrix flaviceps_) is also mentioned. It is a rare species of marmoset endemic to the rainforests of southeastern Brazil and occurs in southern Espírito Santo and possibly northern Rio de Janeiro, and its distribution extends into Minas Gerais, the very areas where yellow fever has been occurring. Unfortunately, there is no feasible way to halt YF virus transmission among these non-human primates. Killing them is not a solution. One hopes that enough individuals will survive for the species to recover. - Mod.TY
