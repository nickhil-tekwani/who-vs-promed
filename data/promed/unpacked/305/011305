I am sure if this is a naive posting, or someone trying to start a debate on
ProMED-mail.
Draft Public Health Service Guideline on Infectious Disease Issues in
Xenotransplantation; Notice, September 23, 1996 website:
<http://www.fda.gov/cber/guidelines.htm>
The U.S. guidelines were put out for public comment in 1996. A revision will
be published in the summer of 1998 after further review from the CDC, FDA,
National Institutes of Health,and the Health Research Services Administration.
There has been strong debate on the proposal to ban outright xenotransplants
from non-human primate sources. The U.S. position is that although not
banned outright, the guidelines and regulatory framework in place would make
it extremely unlikely that a non-primate to human transplant would take place.
There seems to be a general agreement that non-human primates pose a higher
risk of xeno-zoonoses and that the supply, ethics and economics would not
make this (use of non-primates) a viable option.
