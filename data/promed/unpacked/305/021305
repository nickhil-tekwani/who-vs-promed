18 000 trees cut in Thurgau due to fireblight
---------------------------------------------
In the fruit growing areas in the canton of Thurgau, the tree disease fireblight has been showing up this year [2012] more or less everywhere. The infestation is not equally bad at all locations, but on 6 hectares [15 acres] 18 000 trees had to be cut so far.

Urs Mueller of the Thurgau plant protection service said that mainly orchards at higher altitudes producing the late flowering apple variety Gala are affected. Lower levels of infestation have been observed in the growing areas near Lake Constance. Use of streptomycin sprays was not recommended for this region in 2012, but this recommendation will be reviewed for next year.

In 2007, Thurgau was severely affected by fireblight. On approximately 56 hectares [138 acres] more than 200 000 trees had to be cut down.

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince, and apple are susceptible, although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only members of the _Rosaceae_ are affected, mainly the sub-family _Maloideae_ (synonym _Pomoideae_), but also many cultivated rose and bramble varieties. The known host range covers more than 140 species from 40 genera. Many ornamental and weed species serve as pathogen reservoirs for crop infections.

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend forming black hooks; some fruit may show lesions; cankers appear on branches and trunks, and trees invariably die. The bacteria enter the host plant through wounds and are highly infectious. They are spread by insect activity (including pollinators), wind, water (rain, irrigation), mechanical means (tools, orchard workers), and with plant material (including budwood). Importation of plant material including fruit (shipments may also contain contaminated leaf or twig fragments) from areas with endemic fireblight poses a considerable quarantine risk. The pathogen has been included in the quarantine lists of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

The pathogens overwinter almost exclusively in cankers on limbs infected during the previous season, and consequently, the amount of inoculum and thus the risk of outbreaks are increased following years with high fireblight levels.

Phytosanitation and monitoring are used to attempt exclusion of fireblight from individual orchards. Disease management may include cultural measures (such as removal of pathogen reservoirs) and bacteriocidal sprays. Certain cultivar/rootstock combinations may provide some protection. Currently, the most effective control is application of streptomycin during flowering, but the use of antibiotics in agriculture is mostly subject to strict regulations. A continued spread of _E. amylovora_ to new areas and the emergence of new streptomycin resistant strains are a major concern.

In Switzerland, fireblight has been spreading rapidly since 2007. In 2008, streptomycin was officially approved to fight the disease, with some restrictions, but this decision caused opposition from environmental groups (ProMED-mail post 20080729.2310).
