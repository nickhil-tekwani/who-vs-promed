The Colorado Division of Wildlife (DOW) is reporting an outbreak of
distemper among the raccoon population around Glenwood Springs. Perry Will,
area wildlife manager for the DOW, said that the DOW has received hundreds
of phone calls in the past few weeks from residents regarding raccoons
acting strangely.

The canine distemper virus is a disease found in a variety of animals
including raccoons, foxes, coyotes, and skunks, but can also affect
domestic dogs as well. The disease in raccoons can be transmitted to other
animals, but cats and humans are not affected by canine distemper. The
disease causes fever, coughing and catarrh, an excessive discharge or
buildup of mucus in the nose or throat.

Distemper is a nasty disease, according to DOW spokesman Randy Hampton,
that moves quickly and is most often fatal. Oftentimes, once the animal
contracts the disease, Hampton said, it can be fatal within 24 hours.
Raccoons affected by the disease will move slowly and may lie around or
become very disoriented. But they can still be very aggressive and can
cause harm to people or pets. "What happens is the animal becomes very
lethargic," Hampton said. "But if you get too close it may become very
aggressive. It's important that people stay away from these animals."

A raccoon captured by the DOW near Glenwood Springs recently tested
positive for distemper, Will said. Glenwood Springs police chief Terry
Wilson said that his office has received several calls in the past week as
well regarding raccoons acting out of the ordinary. "A lot of people think
it's rabies," Wilson said, "but it's not."

An infected raccoon can transmit the disease easily by coming into contact
with a dog's food or water dish. Pet owners are encouraged to keep their
pet bowls inside and make sure that their dogs' vaccinations and distemper
shots are up to date. Area dog owners who have vaccinated their dogs should
not have anything to worry about, according to Dr Rocky Mease, a
veterinarian with Glenwood Veterinary Clinic. "[Canine distemper] is one of
the core vaccines we do on dogs," Mease said. "Most have been vaccinated
for distemper." Typically puppies receive a series of vaccinations within
the 1st 18 months and booster shots thereafter that protect them from this
and many other diseases. "The real crux of the issue is that if you
vaccinate your dog, your dog is safe," Mease said.

Hampton said that if residents find a dead raccoon on their property they
can either bury it deep enough so that a dog cannot dig it up, or triple
wrap it in trash bags and throw it away. The disease is naturally occurring
and, according to Hampton, infects raccoon populations every 5 to 7 years.
He said that the disease hit the area around Grand Junction 2 years ago.
People who see suspicious raccoons and have concerns can contact the local
DOW office at (970) 947-2920.

[Distemper can mimic rabies in some species. Hopefully, some type of
diagnostic testing has been performed to verify that the disease is indeed
distemper.

Everyone should have their pets vaccinated against rabies, and dogs should
also be vaccinated against distemper. - Mod.TG
