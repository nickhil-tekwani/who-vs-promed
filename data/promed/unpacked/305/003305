Bird Flu Scare Emerges in Sukhothai
-----------------------------------
Livestock officials in Sukhothai Province reported the discovery of
the H5N1 virus in domestic chickens raised by Mee Puengwang, a
resident of Nong Wong Kwian Village in Swankalok District.

Assistant Village Chief Jamnien Puengwang said that 29 families in
the village raised a total of nearly 1000 chickens before a number of
them began to die of suspicious causes. She said there were no
reports of the deaths of these fowls as some villagers were worried
that their fighting birds might be slaughtered due to bird-flu fears.

After officials declared the discovery, all chickens in Sawankalok
District were destroyed and their owners are to receive 32 baht
[approx 0.90 USD] per kg for the killed birds.

Sukhothai Governor Yothin Samutkheeree has urged all related agencies
to keep a close eye on the probable viral spread, especially in the
areas where H5N1 was once found. Locals have been asked to report any
suspicious deaths of birds immediately.

During the months of August and September, bird-flu virus was
reportedly spreading in Sawankalok District before it was recently
detected again in a nearby district.
