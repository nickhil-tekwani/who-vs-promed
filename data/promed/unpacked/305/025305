Thailand: Contact of Latest Victim with Birds Denied
-----------------------------------------------
Disease experts say that the latest avian influenza case [a woman
described in ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human - East Asia
(155): Thailand 20051101.3190] contracted the H5N1 virus from "the
environment." The woman, who became the latest confirmed case of
human bird-flu, contracted the H5N1 virus from the environment rather
than from infected birds, the Public Health Ministry said yesterday
[Tue 1 Nov 2005].

Dr. Thawat Suntharachan, director-general of the Ministry's Disease
Control Department, said the 50-year-old woman was confirmed on
Monday [31 Oct 2005] as the 20th case of bird flu in Thailand since
2003. He said the victim was the 8th person to contract the virus
without touching a dead chicken. The 7 previous cases were reported
last year [2004]. Dr. Kumnuan Ungchusak, head of the Bureau of
Epidemiology, said 6 of those were children who might have caught the
virus while playing near infected chicken feces or fluids. The adult
who caught the virus last year [2004] without coming into contact
with dead chickens was infected in the same way as the latest case, he said.

The latest victim lived in Bangkok, but she was believed to have
contracted the virus in Nonthaburi province, where her husband raised
poultry that had fallen sick. Thawat said the woman told
epidemiologists investigating the case that she did not touch any
dead chickens while she was in Nonthaburi. Her husband said he raised
about 30 fighting cocks and bantams in his backyard. When some of
them died, he decided to cull the rest because he suspected that they
might have been infected with the avian-flu virus. He said he did not
report the deaths to authorities as required because he thought
culling the infected poultry and burying them properly was enough.

He said that was aware that he could have contracted the virus while
burying the dead poultry, so he wrapped his hands in plastic bags
before touching the dead animals. Although he was in good health,
doctors prescribed 10 anti-viral Tamiflu tablets for him to take as a
preventive measure.

The husband said that he was away when his wife went to the
Nonthaburi house to visit him, Thawat said. After visiting the house,
the woman became ill, tired and found it difficult to breath. She
later went to see doctors at Siriraj Hospital because she thought she
might have avian influenza. Dr. Kumnuan went to the house in
Nonthaburi and said it was very likely that the woman contracted the
virus either through exposure to infected feces around the house or
from eating fruit that she had picked up off the ground. There were
stains of chicken feces on a makeshift wooden stretcher that she sat
on while she waited for her husband. Next to the stretcher was a
small pond of filthy water containing chicken feces. The woman
admitted to eating a piece of fruit that fell from the ground after
cleaning it with the dirty water.

2 other patients are also suspected of contracting the virus,
including a 4-year-old girl from Phichit who yesterday [1 Nov 2005]
tested positive to the H3N2 virus of human influenza, not H5N1,
Thawat said. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra yesterday
vented his anger at Deputy Bangkok Governor Dr. Pensri Pichaisanith
for telling reporters on Monday [31 Oct 2005] that both the woman and
the girl had bird flu.

[The route of transmission of avian H5N1 virus to the small number of
people who have contracted overt symptoms of infection, with
sometimes fatal outcome, remains conjectural. It is likely that
lapses in personal hygiene and inadequate sanitation may play a major
role, since the disease mainly afflicts people in domestic
surroundings and not those involved in commercial poultry husbandry.
The other impediment to understanding more about the transmission of
avian influenza to humans is the lack of information concerning the
number of infected, but asymptomatic, individuals in exposed
communities. One of our interested ProMED-mail subscribers, has
compiled the following data for the current phase of the outbreak
beginning in December 2004 that reveals great variation in
surveillance in different countries

Viet Nam
--------
(latest report 29 Oct 2005)
Bird to human reported cases: 67 with 23 deaths
WHO-confirmed cases: 64 cases with 21 deaths
Note: Human-to-human infection reported as possible. (WHO has stated
that human-to-human transmission is possible in some past cases, but
limited. CDC states that details on possible past human-to-human
cases are still under investigation.)

Indonesia
---------
(latest report 24 Oct 2005)
Bird-to-human reported cases: 85 cases with 9 deaths
WHO-confirmed cases: 7 cases with 4 deaths
Note: Human-to-human infection: none reported or confirmed. As of 6
Oct 2005, the Indonesian Health Ministry reported 80 unconfirmed
cases; (a few were diagnosed later as typhoid fever, but the status
of the others is unknown).

Thailand
--------
(latest report 31 Oct 2005)
Bird-to-human reported cases: 3 cases with one death
WHO-confirmed cases: 3 cases and one death
Note: Human-to-human infection: one case with one death suspected.
There are press reports of 34 villagers (Kalasin districts) under
close surveillance (31 Oct 2005) and 1369 people under observation
(30 Oct 2005).

Cambodia
--------
(latest report 19 Apr 2005)
Bird-to-human: 4 cases with 4 deaths
WHO-confirmed: 4 cases with 4 deaths
No human-to-human infection reported

China
-----
(as of 27 Oct 2005)
No cases reported, but the WHO has asked for more testing of 2 fatal
cases in Hunan province that were reported as not being H5N1 cases.
On 28 Oct 2005, the WHO requested China to provide more test data.

The discrepancies between the outcome of surveillance in different
countries need to be resolved before the true incidence of avian
influenza in the human population can be estimated. - Mod.CP]
