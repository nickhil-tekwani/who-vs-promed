Febrile illness in Hajj pilgrims returning to Austria
-----------------------------------------------------
As of 27 Oct 2014, 7 Hajj pilgrims sought medical consultation in hospitals/medical institutions in Vienna [Austria]. Clinical symptoms were cough (57 percent), dyspnea (14 percent) and fever (57 percent). 3 out of 7 patients had a febrile acute illness with clinical and/or radiological evidence of pulmonary parenchymal disease. One patient had sought medical consultation in Saudi Arabia, and one patient had been hospitalized for 10 days in Saudi Arabia.

The testing of Hajj pilgrims with acute severe respiratory infections is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO aims to identify infections with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which have been occurring in Saudi Arabia since 2012. From each patient, serum and respiratory specimens were tested within the day of collection at the Department of Virology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria, for MERS-CoV, influenza A, B viruses and rhinoviruses. 3 out of 7 patients tested positive for influenza B virus, 2 for influenza A (H3N2) and 2 for rhinoviruses.

The phylogenetic analysis of the A (H3N2) viruses and B viruses revealed viruses belonging to the A/Hongkong/146/2013-like viruses and B/Phuket/3073/2013-like viruses of the Yamagata lineage, which are covered by the H3N2 and B strains included in the vaccine for the season 2014/2015 for the northern hemisphere.

[As recommended by the WHO, Hajj pilgrims returning from Saudi Arabia with severe acute respiratory conditions should be examined for evidence of MERS-CoV infection. In this event, none of 7 patients hospitalised in Vienna after return from Hajj showed any signs of past or present MERS-CoV infection. The infectious agents were identified as influenza A and B viruses, and rhinoviruses. No evidence of MERS-CoV infection was revealed. - Mod.CP
