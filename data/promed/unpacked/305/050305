Canada: First Detection of West Nile Virus in New Brunswick
-------------------------------------------------------------
Results of analyses conducted in New Brunswick have confirmed the presence
of West Nile virus [WNV] in the Province, according to the Chief Medical
Officer for Public Health, Dr. Wayne MacDonald in Fredericton. The carcass
of an infected bird, a crow, was found in New Maryland in the periphery of
Fredericton.
The Ministry of Health and Welfare of the province declared they will
intensify surveillance activities in a 50-km sector around New Maryland,
but they do not have sufficient supplies of insecticide at the current
moment. The Ministry of Health and Welfare require the population to report
the presence of carcasses of crows, corbels, Canadian titmouses, and
bluejays through a toll-free line for WNV in the province.
"Now that we know that WNV is present in the province, it is all the more
important that residents take necessary precautions to avoid mosquito
bites" said Dr. Wayne MacDonald in an official statement. The risk of
suffering disease caused by WNV is relatively low and the risks of serious
consequences from disease are even lower, affirmed the doctor, emphasizing
that it was important to avoid mosquito bites.
