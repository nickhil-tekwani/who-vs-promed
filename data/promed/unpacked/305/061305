[2] Senegal: sylvatic cycle
Date: Mon 16 Oct 2017

ref: Althouse BM, Guerbois M, Cummings DAT, et al. Role of monkeys in the sylvatic cycle of chikungunya virus in Senegal. bioRxiv; doi: 10.1101/079046
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) pose the greatest risk of spillover into humans of any class of pathogens. Such spillover may occur as a one-step jump from a reservoir host species into humans or as a 2-step jump from the reservoir to a different amplification host species and thence to humans. Despite the widespread havoc wreaked by emerging arboviruses, little is known about their transmission dynamics in reservoir and amplification hosts. Here we used serosurveillance and mathematical modeling to elucidate the role of monkeys in the sylvatic, enzootic cycle of chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Over 3 years, 219 African green monkeys, 78 patas monkeys, and 440 Guinea baboons were captured in the region surrounding Kedougou, Senegal. The age of each animal was determined by anthropometry and dentition, and exposure to CHIKV was determined by detection of neutralizing antibodies. We estimate age-specific CHIKV seroprevalence, force of infection (FoI), and basic reproductive number (R0) in each species. Among the different species, CHIKV FoI ranged from 0.13 to 1.12 (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 0.81-2.28) and R0 ranged from 1.5 (CI 1.3-1.9) to 6.6 (CI 5.1-10.4). CHIKV infection of infant monkeys was detected even when the virus was not detected in a concurrent survey of primatophilic mosquitoes and when population seropositivity, and therefore immunity, was too high for monkeys themselves to support continuous CHIKV transmission. We therefore conclude that monkeys in this region serve primarily as amplification rather than reservoir hosts of CHIKV. Additional efforts are needed to identify other vertebrate hosts capable of supporting continuous circulation.

[One hopes that a comprehensive serosurvey of other vertebrate animals will be undertaken in the areas where the positive monkeys were found, followed by laboratory tests of susceptibility to determine the amplitude and duration of viremia (if any) in the positive species. Similar studies are needed in the tropical Americas to determine is spill-back from humans to wild vertebrates, and especially non-human primates, has occurred there. - Mod.TY

[3] Colombia: persistent arthralgia

ref: Chang AY, Encinales L, Porras A, et al. Frequency of chronic joint pain following chikungunya infection: a Colombian cohort study. Arthritis Rheumatol. 2017. doi: 10.1002/art.40384. [Epub ahead of print]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Objective
To estimate the frequency of chronic joint pain after infection with chikungunya virus in a Latin American cohort.
Methods
A cross sectional follow-up of a prospective cohort of 500 chikungunya patients from Atlántico department, Colombia clinically diagnosed with chikungunya during the 2014-2015 Colombian epidemic. Baseline and follow-up (20 months) symptoms were evaluated in serologically confirmed cases.
Results
Among 500 patients enrolled, 485 cases were serologically confirmed with chikungunya [virus infections]. Patients were predominantly adults (age 49 +/- 16 years), female, had a high school or less level of education, and were of mestizo ethnicity. The most commonly affected joints were the small joints including the wrists, ankles, and fingers. The initial joint pain lasted a median of 4 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3-8); 16 per cent of participants reported missing a median of 4 days (IQR 2-7) of school or work. After 20-months, 1/4 of the participants had persistent joint pain. A multivariable analysis indicated that significant predictors of persistent joint pain included college graduate status, initial symptoms of headache or knee pain, missed work, normal activities affected, 4 or more days of initial symptoms, and 4 or more weeks of initial pain.
Conclusions
This is the 1st report to describe the frequency of chikungunya-related arthritis in the Americas after a 20 month follow-up. The high frequency of chronic disease highlights the importance of development of prevention and treatment interventions.

[There are many anecdotal accounts of persistent and sometimes disabling persistent joint pain following chikungunya virus infections. The report above provides the results of a quantitative study of arthralgia, lasting 20 or more months following infection in a quarter of the study group. A follow up study of 36 pregnant women hospitalized in Colombia in 2015, 1 year after acute viremia, reported arthralgia in 2 or more joints in 13 patients. Despite disease severity, pregnant women with chikungunya should be treated in high-complexity obstetric units to rule out adverse outcomes. These women should also be followed up to treat potential relapses (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/11/17-0480_article). - Mod.TY]

[4] Brazil: mortality

http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/excess-mortality-related-to-chikungunya-epidemics-in-the-context-of-co-circulation-of-other-arboviruses-in-brazil/


Freitas ARR, Cavalcanti L, Von Zuben AP, Donalisio MR. Excess mortality related to chikungunya epidemics in the context of co-circulation of other arboviruses in Brazil. PLOS Currents Outbreaks. 2017 . Edition 1. doi: 10.1371/currents.outbreaks.14608e586cd321d8d5088652d7a0d884
-------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Introduction
Chikungunya is an emerging arbovirus that reached the Western Hemisphere at the end of 2013. Studies in the Indian Ocean and India suggest that passive surveillance systems cannot recognize many of deaths associated with chikungunya, which can be inferred by an increase in the overall mortality observed during chikungunya epidemics.
Objective
We assess the mortality associated with chikungunya epidemics in the most affected states in Brazil, from 2015 and 2016.
Methods
We studied the monthly mortality by age group, comparing a period without epidemics to a chikungunya epidemic period, which we defined arbitrarily as consecutive months with incidences of more than 50 cases/100 000 persons.
Results
We obtained official data from the National System of Reported Diseases (SINAN) and the Mortality Information System (SIM), both maintained by the Ministry of Health. We identified a significant increase in the all-cause mortality rate during chikungunya epidemics, while there was no similar mortality in the previous years, even during dengue epidemics. We estimated an excess of 4505 deaths in Pernambuco during the chikungunya epidemics (47.9 per 100 000 persons). The most affected age groups were the elderly and those under 1 year of age, and the same pattern occurred in all the states.
Discussion
Further studies at other sites are needed to confirm the association between increased mortality and chikungunya epidemics in different age groups. If these findings are confirmed, it will be necessary to revise the guidelines to recognize the actual mortality associated with chikungunya and to improve therapeutic approaches and protective measures in the most vulnerable groups.
