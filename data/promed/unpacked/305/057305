Shrimp farmers in the South [of Thailand] are facing an outbreak of a
disease caused by climatic changes which is killing off their stock.
Surasak Ruengchan, an agriculture official in Krabi province, said his
office has received reports from several districts regarding thousands of
farmers having suffered losses from the disease.
The "red discoloration" disease stemmed from the continuous dry weather,
which has raised the salinity of water in shrimp ponds to the point where
the crustaceans cannot survive. This dry weather is expected to also affect
nearby provinces such as Trang and Nakhon Si Thammarat, which has the
greatest number of shrimp farms.
Pratueng Tippayamas, president of the Pak Phanang shrimp farmers group in
Nakhon Si Thammarat, said though farmers were increasingly concerned, they
were refusing to switch to other means of livelihood, because shrimp prices
were now quite high as a result of the recent establishment of a central
market in the province.
