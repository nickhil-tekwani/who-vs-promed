Glanders Outbreak
Taking into account the number of cases of the current glanders epidemics,
a fatal disease that affects equines, the Secretariat of Agriculture
started this week to examine animals in the several rural areas in the
State. Specifically, during this weekend a team was sent to perform the
task at the "Cow fair" in Arapiraca, where other animal species like
horses, mules, and donkeys are also for trade.
Preventive action
-------------------
"This is a preventive action. Up to now, we detected only one case of
this disease at Sao Jose da Laje. Since there is no treatment for this
disease, the animal must killed, in order to eradicate the spread of the
disease into the area," said Elizete Pereira, director of Animal Safety
of Setag [note: it might be acronym for Secretariat of Agriculture]. She
explains that veterinarians are performing serologic tests of all
equines, taking advantages of the current cattle fairs -- places where
there is a large number of horses. The disease is caused by a bacterium
[_Burkholderia mallei_], as pointed out by Elizete, also stressing that
the International Office of Epizootics [OIE] warns that the disease also
affects humans, sometimes fatally. There is no vaccine to prevent this
disease.
"Normally donkeys and mules are affected by the acute form while horses
are affected by the chronic (hidden) form. These horses act as reservoirs
of the disease in breeding stations", explains the professional.
Symptoms:
---------
In the acute respiratory form the animal has a high temperature,
coughing, running and discharging nose, and eventually ulcers and nodules
along the limbs and abdomen; in the chronic form there is a chronic
pneumonia followed by skin ulcers on the limbs and inside the nose. In
the cutaneous form the nodules and ulcers appear on the internal region
of the limbs and eventually discharge a dark yellow secretion, like pus.
The transmission is through spurs, harness, curbs and other materials
with the secretion from the infected wounds.

[An affected animal was reported from the same area on 19 Dec 1999, by
OIE; at the same time six other affected horses were reported in
Pernambuco. It is a sugar growing area in the northeast of Brazil. -
