SALMONELLA TYPHIMURIUM DT104 - DENMARK
======================================
Date: Tue, 29 Apr 97 07:53:56 +0200
From: Flemming Bager <flb@svs.dk>
_Salmonella typhimurium_ DT104 has recently been isolated from food animals
in Denmark. Results of extensive monitoring programmes indicate that the
prevalence of DT104 is likely to be low, and efforts are being made to
eradicate it.
We are interested to know whether specific efforts to control DT104 have
been made in other countries and whether they have been succesful. What
measures were taken in herds to eliminate the bacterium?
DT104 is usually resistant to Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, Streptomycin,
Sulfa and Tetracycline. What is the position of the genetic determinators
of resistance with respect to each other, do they always belong to a single
cassette?
We occasionally find heterogenous resistance patterns among DT104 in
infected herds. For example, DT104 strains not found to be different by
PFGE typing may be resistant to all the above antibiotics or to Sulfa and
Strep only. Do others have similar experiences?
[Denmark is not the only place to begin looking for DT104 variants of
_Salmonella typhimurium_. It appears we may have a similiar pattern as with
the emergence of phage type 4 in _Salmonella enteritidis_. Any comments or
summaries of experience to date would be useful. Mod. pc ]
