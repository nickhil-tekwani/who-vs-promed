There are fears the Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease may have spread to
within a few km of a previously disease-free area in the state's North.
Devil disease team leader Alistair Scott yesterday [26 Jan 2005] revealed
that a devil with a mouth lesion had been found as road kill just 10 km
from Narawntapu National Park.
If the devil had the disease, it would be the closest the fatal disease has
been found near the park, which has remained clear of the disease despite
its having spread further westward.
The park has been used as a location to trap and quarantine disease-free
devils that could later be used as the foundation for an insurance devil
population.
If the disease reaches the park, it would be a blow for future devil
programs, leaving the Tasman Peninsula as the only area of the state where
disease-free eastern devils could be found.
Mr. Scott said the devil was found by a Parks and Wildlife Service ranger
near Harford, not far from the Frankford Highway.
The animal has since been taken to Launceston, where tests over the next
few days are expected reveal whether it was infected by the disease.
Mr. Scott said the devil disease team would consider increasing monitoring
and even disease suppression in the area in a bid to keep the park clear.

[This is very sad news, as it does not seem that there is much progress in
control/cure of this devastating disease. For those who are unfamiliar with
the devil tumor disease, please see

These creatures can appear both vicious as well as quite pleasant. - Mod.TG]
