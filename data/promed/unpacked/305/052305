The number of chikungunya cases in the country has climbed to 10, authorities announced on Monday [20 Jan 2014].

Health Minister Cornelius de Weever said a country-wide cleanup will start on 25 Jan [2014] to eliminate mosquito breeding sites in the various districts. Of the 10 cases recorded, 2 were earlier this month [January 2014].

Minister of Public Housing, Spatial Planning, Environment and Infrastructure Maurice Lake said his ministry and stakeholders will start removing old car wrecks this week, which can serve as a breeding ground for mosquitoes. "I am appealing to the St Maarten population to take this matter seriously and do what has to be done to eliminate mosquito breeding areas. Every individual, household, and business has a responsibility to take action and protect public health and our economy. My ministry VROMI is busy working with waste disposal companies to draft a plan of action for a country-wide clean-up to start on 25 Jan 2014. We need everybody onboard for this country-wide effort," Lake said.

Prime Minister Sarah Wescot-Williams said a wide-scale inter-ministerial cooperation and cooperation on an international level is also part of the response to the virus. "Since there are now established cases on Dutch St Maarten, our medical health sector is working very closely with PAHO and WHO on the best ways to combat the virus and keep St Maarten healthy for its residents and visitors," she was quoted as saying in the release. "The focus right now is not only on communicating the steps which can be taken by all individuals to combat the virus, but also important is the message stressing cooperation across the board. The emphasis is on all ministries working together to understand the potential of this disease if left unchecked. In addition to that is individual responsibility; while we should not be pushing the panic button, we should all share the responsibility as far as curbing the spread of the chikungunya virus," Wescot-Williams added.

She said the travel advisory, which was issued by the United States Department of State, is part of procedure once a transmissible virus such as dengue and chikungunya is detected. "The advisories are not to push the panic button but are related to reporting and advisory obligations. Despite the virus being recorded on St Maarten, the island is safe for residents and visitors, and government is focusing considerable effort on controlling the disease," she noted.

De Weever said St Maarten remains a safe tourism and travel destination despite challenges posed by dengue and chikungunya. The Ministry of Public Health continues to conduct epidemiological surveillance to collect and analyse data from the various stakeholders in the health field on a weekly basis. Control staff are visiting yards and properties in the districts and advising residents to take immediate action. De Weever is appealing to social and civic clubs as well as community councils to come together with their members and assist the people in their districts with clean-up campaigns when the national cleanup action starts.

Chikungunya, similar to dengue [epidemiologically], is a virus transmitted by the same mosquito that spreads dengue. The symptoms are similar to dengue fever and may include a sudden high fever, headache, rash, nausea, and muscle pain. Stiffness and severe joint pain, especially in the wrists, knuckles, or ankles, are more often associated with chikungunya. The incubation period (time from infection to illness) can be 2-12 days but is usually 3-7 days. Acute chikungunya fever typically lasts from a few days to a few weeks, and some infected patients in the Asian region have reported debilitating arthritic pain persisting for weeks or months.

Most patients feel better within a week; some people may develop longer-term joint pain; people at increased risk for severe disease include newborns exposed during delivery, older adults, and people with medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease. Deaths are rare. There is no vaccine or medication to prevent chikungunya virus infection. The recommended prevention is to reduce mosquito exposure.

De Weever said that the governments of both sides of the island are taking all measures necessary to mitigate further increase in these mosquito-borne viral diseases. Residents and visitors are reminded to protect themselves, especially when out during dusk and dawn hours, by using mosquito repellent or wearing proper clothing to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.

The Collective Prevention Services is calling on all businesses, schools, students, community councils, social clubs, and public services to actively take actions on a daily basis to eliminate mosquitoes by checking containers such as buckets and water tanks for larvae and eliminating breeding sources. If there aren't any containers with water for mosquitoes to lay their larvae, there won't be any adult mosquitoes.

[The current chikungunya virus outbreak began on the French side of the island (St Martin) and was officially diagnosed and reported there on 5 Dec 2013. The 1st case on the Dutch side of the island (St Maarten) was reported on 28 Dec 2013. The case number there has now reached 10.

There is concern that this outbreak will adversely affect tourism to the island, with economic losses if cases continue to increase. The French and Dutch health authorities on St Martin are to be commended for quickly mounting a coordinated effort that includes both French and Dutch sides of the island. One hopes that their efforts for vector control and surveillance are successful and bring the relatively small outbreak to a halt, without further spread on the island or to other areas in the Caribbean.

The risk of spread to other localities is real, especially to areas of dengue transmission in the Americas. This virus has been introduced in various areas of the world by viremic travelers into localities where the vector is present, with initiation of ongoing transmission.
