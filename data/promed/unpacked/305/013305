Possible case of "Mad Cow" disease appears in Golan kibbutz herd
----------------------------------------------------------------
Officials from the Agriculture Ministry's Veterinary Service have come
upon a possible case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE --
Mad Cow disease) in a cattle herd on a kibbutz in the Golan Heights.
A 10-year-old cow in the kibbutz's herd contracted symptoms
resembling rabies several days ago, and then died. If confirmed, this
would be the first case of BSE, which is lethal to livestock, appearing
in Israel.

Brain samples have been sent to an international laboratory for
confirmation of the possibility of BSE.

[The following additional information has been obtained from Dr
Oded Nir, CVO of Israel: Initial laboratory examinations of the suspect
material were carried out on 28 May 2002 by the Department of
Pathology at the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan. Results of the
immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry tests were indicative for
BSE. The material has been consequently forwarded for confirmation
to the OIE reference laboratory in the Institute of Animal Neurology,
University of Bern, Switzerland. Their results are expected during
this week.
According to OIE recommendations, the cohorts (3) and progeny of
the suspected cow have been put under quarantine until the final results
of the reference laboratory are obtained, and the slaughter of bovines
older than 30 months throughout Israel has been banned until then.
Should the diagnosis be confirmed, then a planned BSE-control action-
scheme will be put into operation, including testing of all slaughtered
cattle over 30 months and destruction of SRMs.
The Israeli veterinary services have taken rigorous and early steps to
prevent the introduction of BSE to Israel, despite the fact that Israel
depends on external sources of feed. This included banning the import
of mammal MBM (meat-&-bone meal) from the UK since 1988, and
from all countries since 1990. An active BSE surveillance and
monitoring scheme has been operational since 1996, including testing
of fallen adult bovines, randomly sampled healthy animals, and suspect
animals. The current discovery of the BSE-suspected case is an
outcome of the scheme.
Though, at this stage, the case is pending confirmation, it has been
decided -- within the traditional transparency policy of the Israel
Veterinary Services -- to publish the suspect case. - Mod.AS]
