A new human case of the H7N9 avian flu strain has been reported in south China's Guangdong Province, the provincial health and family planning commission said [on Thu 26 May 2016]. The 63 year old male patient in Meizhou City is the 12th H7N9 case reported in Guangdong this year [2016]. 4 out of the 12 infected patients died, the commission said.

The number of infections this year [2016] decreased by 83 per cent compared with the same period of last year, according to the commission.

H7N9 is a bird flu strain first reported to have infected humans in March 2013 in China. It is most likely to strike in winter and spring.

[The report does not comment on the nature of the patient's exposure to poultry or products thereof; so far, the majority of infections have resulted from exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. At present, this virus does not appear to transmit easily from person to person, and sustained human to human transmission has not been reported. - Mod.UBA
