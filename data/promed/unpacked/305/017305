An outbreak of a rapidly fatal livestock disease has led to the loss of 675 camels in Turkana County threatening pastoralism which is a major source of livelihood to residents of the vast region that is also experiencing a devastating drought.

Haemorrhagic Septicaemia locally known as Lookot is a contagious bacterial disease caused by certain strains of _Pasteurella multocida_ and is spread through contact with infected animals' fluids and excretion as well as ingestion and inhalation of the bacteria.

[Turkana County is situated in northwest Kenya, a semi-arid climate region bordering Lake Turkana in the east, Pokot, Rendille and Samburu people to the south, Uganda to the west, and South Sudan and Ethiopia to the north. Camel raising is one of the main traditional occupations /activities of the Turkana people.

In the absence of information on clinical signs, gross pathological changes and laboratory investigations, it is not clear on which grounds the fatal camel disease observed in Turkana has been coined _Haemorrhagic septicaemia_. It is also not known which vaccine is being applied. The OIE-listed disease _Haemorrhagic septicaemia_ is caused by certain serotypes of _Pasteurella multocida_ and is restricted, in this context, to cattle and buffalo. This disease has, as officially reported to the OIE, and had its last occurrence in Kenya in 2002.

In Pakistan, an outbreak of a respiratory disease in the dromedary population of Greater Cholistan desert, in November-December 2010, was described (Ref 1). Prevalence, cumulative mortality and case fatality were 0.79, 0.018 and 0.023, respectively. Postmortem findings indicated septicemia and _Pasteurella multocida_ subsp. _multocida_ was isolated from representative clinical and morbid specimens.

According to literature, the vernacular term Lookot, in respect to a camel disease, is applied in Turkana to a form of anthrax typified by bloody diarrhoea, but may also relate to pasteurellosis (Ref 2). According to another source, Lookot stands, in Turkama, for anthrax in sheep (Ref 3).

On top of the bacterial diseases anthrax and pasteurellosis, camel morbidity and mortality may be due, in this region, to viral and other causative agents, including PPR and RVF.

Final diagnosis is pending until further diagnostic information becomes available.

Additional information/comments will be welcomed.
