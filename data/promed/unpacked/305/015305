Hantavirus infection - Brazil (Parana)
--------------------------------------
Health authorities have reported that 3 more persons are suspected to have
been infected by hantavirus in the Municipality of General Carneiro (36 km
southwest of Uniao da Vitoria, Parana). Samples have been sent to the
Instituto Adolfo Lutz in Sao Paulo and the results [may be available
within 2 weeks. Until last week [? 4 more cases were confirmed. The death
of a 34 year-old lumberjack was reported in early October.
Hantavirus [infection appeared in reforested areas where wild rats are
said to live. Hantavirus was first reported in Parana in 1999 when 7 cases
were encountered; 4 in General Carneiro, 2 in Cruz Machado and one in
Honorio Serpa. A total of 5 of these 7 cases was fatal. Cases of the
disease appeared for the first time in Brazil in 1993 and [up to the
present 65 cases have been reported, 39 of them resulting in deaths.
In order to avoid an epidemic a campaign on how to avoid hantavirus infection
[has been initiated among the 2000 workers of the forestry industry, which
is the main activity of General Carneiro area.
