A "disproportionate number of cases" of pertussis, or whooping cough, in the Black Hills has led officials at a Spearfish medical clinic to stop seeing children for routine well-baby visits.

Dr Angela Anderson, a pediatrician at Spearfish Regional Medical Clinic, said the clinic's staff have diagnosed 10 cases in the past 2 weeks through diagnostic culture and those numbers are expected to rise. "We have been so inundated (with patients showing symptoms) we have cancelled routine well-baby visits," she said. That reason is 2-fold -- to be able to care for those affected and to keep healthy children from being exposed from pertussis.

"We have reorganized our clinic space and staff to handle the influx of patients," she said. "It has been this way for several weeks but increased in severity recently." A diagnostic culture takes 10 days to 2 weeks to receive results. The results go to the state for confirmation. A quicker test, the respiratory DFA [direct fluorescent antibody] test, is done in 2 to 3 days. "Many of the preliminary results are positive for pertussis. Cultures are pending on those," she said.

Anderson said patients who have been exposed and are showing symptoms are being tested and treated. Those who had had been exposed but are not yet showing symptoms are being tested and also treated due to the outbreak. "In all cases, we evaluate the vaccine status for the patient and family members and vaccinate if indicated," she said. "Treatment is antibiotics. You have to be on antibiotics for 5 days before you aren't considered contagious."

The increased number of cases in Spearfish prompted one childcare facility to close its doors until 2 Jun 2014. The board of directors at Children First, in Spearfish, held an emergency meeting where they voted to shut down for the rest of the school year.

Earlier in May 2014, the South Dakota Department of Health released information stating that 23 children had tested positive for the disease. On Wed 21 May 2014, they released data showing 6 more positive cases throughout the state. This is the number confirmed after the local clinics and hospitals sent the positive test results.

"For this time of year to have essentially 30 cases, that's not good for us," said Dr Lon Kightlinger, South Dakota state epidemiologist. "We're taking the opportunity to warn people that pertussis is circulating, especially in some of the Black Hills communities."

In 2013 there were 66 cases reported statewide and 71 cases the year before. In 2010 and 2011 there were 32 and 37 cases reported in the state respectively. More cases are suspected this year [2014] but have yet to be confirmed by a lab diagnosis.

[2] California (Sacramento County), nosocomial spread

It was just a normal trip to the hospital. The mother said her 18-month-old daughter had come down with a mild virus, so she took her to Kaiser Permanente in south Sacramento in mid-to-late April 2014. But, when the child got sicker and sicker, they went back to Kaiser on 12 May 2014. The toddler was coughing uncontrollably and sometimes had difficulty breathing. "I took her there to get better not to get worse," the mother said.

Test results after that visit showed the child had pertussis, also known as whooping cough. "It really scared me. I was at work when I found out," the mother said. "I broke down crying. It terrified me to death." Then the mother discovered an employee at the hospital went to work with pertussis in April 2014 at the same time her daughter was there. She said she believes her little girl contracted the potentially deadly disease at the hospital.

Kaiser Permanente South Sacramento's Chief of Infectious Disease Dr John Belko released the following statement:
"Regarding recent media reports about the ongoing pertussis outbreak in Sacramento County, Kaiser Permanente South Sacramento did recently confirm that an employee, who was vaccinated against the disease, tested positive for pertussis. The employee left work as soon as symptoms appeared and was diagnosed.

"As a precaution Kaiser Permanente is contacting members and employees who may have been exposed to the employee as much as 3 weeks prior to the diagnosis because those infected with pertussis can carry the disease for some time before symptoms appear. Out of an abundance of caution, we are contacting members who may have been exposed between 22 Apr 2014 and 6 May 2014.

As of last week [week of 12 May 2014], the Sacramento County Health Department had 69 confirmed cases of whooping cough. In 2013, there were just 59 cases.

Nosocomial spread of _Bordetella pertussis_ infection probably occurs more commonly than is recognized and can be minimized but not eliminated by up-to-date immunization with Tdap [combined tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines] of health care workers.

Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory infection, particularly in the household setting. Indeed, direct inoculation with as few as 140 organisms can cause disease in susceptible children. In a review, attack rates for unvaccinated children in the household setting ranged from 64 percent to 86 percent (average 76 percent) but was much lower (range 0-36 percent) in classroom contract studies. Clearly, transmission required repeated or prolonged exposure and/or close contact. Airborne transmission via respiratory droplets had been postulated but not clearly proven until 2012 when Merkel's laboratory (Warfel JM, Beren J, Merkel TJ: Airborne transmission of _Bordetella pertussis_. J Infect Dis 2012; 206(6): 902-6) demonstrated airborne transmission between infected and naive baboons.

Much of the severe morbidity and almost all of the mortality from _B. pertussis_ infection occur in those younger than 6 months. As many as 63 percent of infants younger than 6 months of age with pertussis require hospitalization. Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea, and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care. - Mod.LL]
