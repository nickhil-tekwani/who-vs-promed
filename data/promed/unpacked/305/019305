USA (West Virginia): rabies outbreak imported from Florida
----------------------------------------------------------
Millions of dollars are spent every year trapping, testing, and vaccinating
West Virginia raccoons. 30 years ago, rabies was unusual in West Virginia.
Then some hunters decided Hardy County was running low on raccoons. They
brought some from Florida to stock up the place. At least, that's the
government's theory. The culprits were never traced. But in 1977, West
Virginia suddenly had its 1st case of raccoon rabies. Those imported Hardy
County raccoons are now to blame for a rabies epizootic (animal epidemic)
that stretches from Canada to North Carolina. Rabies spread upward from
Florida too, and the 2 outbreaks met in the middle. Raccoon rabies now
blankets the eastern seaboard.
Last week, a 2 year old boy in rural Greenbrier County became the latest
victim of raccoon rabies. A sick family cat scratched him. The cat turned
out to have a raccoon-strain of rabies virus, and now the toddler must have
a series of shots to save his life.
Rabid dogs frothing at the mouth were the fear more than 50 years ago. One
bite meant a certain, horrible death unless you got 23 injections in the
stomach. In the 1940s, governments pushed people to vaccinate their pet
dogs. It worked. Dogs have been "practically eliminated" as a rabies
reservoir in the United States, according to the national Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
Wild animals took their place. By 1957 -- the same year the film "Old
Yeller" depicted an heroic family dog shot because of rabies -- there were
more rabid wild animals than rabid dogs. But wild-animal rabies didn't
really take off until 1978, thanks to the Hardy County raccoons. Before
that, government publications spoke in passing of a small raccoon rabies
outbreak confined to Florida. By 1993, wild-animal rabies nationwide had
quadrupled since the "Old Yeller" days. By 2002, West Virginia alone had 6
times more reported animal rabies cases than it did in 1985. Raccoons were
responsible for 3/4ths of them. "The raccoon," state wildlife biologist Jim
Crum said, "should be an example of how we should learn from our mistakes."
Crum is part of a multi-state, multimillion-dollar, multi-agency struggle
to wipe out raccoon rabies. "That is the ultimate goal," said Brie German,
a spokeswoman for the National Rabies Management Program. "But we are a
long way from that." Millions of raccoon "baits", laced with rabies
vaccine, are dropped from airplanes every year over the eastern United
States. They look like ketchup packets. They smell like fish. They're
working. When enough raccoons eat the baits over several years, raccoon
rabies is eventually eradicated from a county. A western front of raccoon
rabies-free counties has formed, right down the middle of West Virginia,
and it is slowly pushing east.
This year [2006], for the 1st time since rabies baits were 1st dropped over
West Virginia in 2001, several counties were declared raccoon rabies-free.
No baits were dropped there this year. The eastern front advanced 5 miles,
and baits were dropped there instead.
Each state must cooperate with the others, keeping the bait zone steady
from north to south, or the front will collapse. "We get a lot of calls
from people" in rabies-infested counties east of the front, said Andy
Moore, a wildlife biologist with the United States Department of
Agriculture in Elkins. " Why don't you just come over here and bait?
Eventually, we'll be moving that way."
How does the government make sure the western front is really
raccoon-rabies clean? In West Virginia, 3 men are paid to patrol the
western front, picking up roadkill and testing it for rabies. They also
corral any sick-acting animals reported to the agency and test them. Other
workers humanely trap hundreds of raccoons every spring and fall. They
sedate the raccoons, shave their necks, draw a blood sample and extract one
of the raccoon's back teeth. If the animal is sick, it is euthanized and
tested further, but most are simply released. The blood samples show
whether the raccoon has rabies immunity. A dye in the bait shows up as a
growth ring in the tooth, visible under special lights, proving that the
raccoon ate the bait.
So far, none of the animals from behind the western front has tested
positive for raccoon rabies. "One of the big things we worry about is
people moving animals, jumping west of the bait zone," Moore said. "You
take one of these [rabid] raccoons over in Pendleton County and move it
over to Jackson County, it would cause huge problems with our program. We
have contingency plans if that happens, but it would cost huge amounts of
money."
Huge amounts of money already are being spent. Between the raccoon baits
and dog vaccines and everything else, the CDC estimates the US spends more
than USD 300 million a year trying to control rabies. Rabies rarely kills
anyone anymore. The shots -- 6 in the arm these days, not 23 to the gut --
are nearly 100 per cent effective. But only one person in the world is
known to have survived rabies without the vaccine. Even with the vaccine,
only 5 people have survived after symptoms set in.
Although human rabies is rare, "we spend an awful lot of time on it," said
Dee Bixler, the state's director of infectious disease epidemiology,
"because it is uniformly fatal. When there's something going on with
rabies, it definitely gets our attention." Bixler was part of a state
health team that went to Greenbrier County after the rabid cat scratched
the 2 year old boy. Shortly before that, a Greenbrier County woman had been
bitten by her kitten, which showed signs of rabies.
Greenbrier County has one of the state's highest rates of rabies, but it's
not the highest. Pendleton, Hardy, Summers, and Grant counties had more
rabid animals reported by the end of August 2006, the latest state numbers
available. But attention focused on Greenbrier County because of the human
contact with the rabid animals, which is relatively rare, especially when
people get their pets vaccinated, as required by law. Pet rabies shots are
inexpensive, "maybe USD 12 in a veterinarian's office," state veterinarian
Joe Starcher said. Even cheaper rabies shots are offered regularly in fire
stations and community buildings across the state, with prices as low as
USD 5. Greenbrier County vets are now offering discount shots in their
regular practices because of the recent outbreak. In the more than 20
counties with no veterinarians, county commissions name somebody to give
the shots.
But there are no approved vaccines for pet raccoons and other wild animals.
The vaccine used in the fishmeal baits is experimental, said Paul Johansen,
assistant chief in charge of game management for the state Division of
Natural Resources. You can't get it in a vet's office. So, as of July 2006,
the DNR has decided that nobody will be allowed to keep pet raccoons, foxes
or skunks anymore. If you already have one, you can keep getting your pet
permit renewed yearly until the animal dies. But no new permits will be
issued. "It is illegal to bring them into the state," Johansen said. "And
it is also illegal to possess them."
Livestock shown at fairs and festivals might be next in line for rabies
shots. A Greenbrier County horse came down with rabies during last year's
[2005] state fair, Starcher said. And the CDC had to notify all 150 000
people who attended the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration in
August 2006 after a 3 year old gelding named Bucky developed severe
neurological symptoms during the week-long event and was euthanized. He
tested positive for rabies, and anyone who came in contact with his saliva
could have been exposed.

[Vaccination of foxes in western Europe has successfully contained the
spread of rabies virus and eliminated human and animal rabies throughout
much of western Europe using vaccines distributed in baits attractive for
the target species. This report gives a graphic account of the ongoing and
largely successful program to control and eliminate raccoon rabies in the
state of West Virginia. Control of rabies transmission from terrestrial
animals to other terrestrial animals and humans is now a successful,
although expensive, procedure for rabies control to such an extent that
aerial bats have become the predominant transmitters of rabies in the
United States and elsewhere.
