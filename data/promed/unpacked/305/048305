Ross River Virus Activity in the Northern Territory of Australia: Update
--------------------------------------------
There is continuing Ross River Virus (RRV) activity in the Northern
Territory of Australia. The heavy rain in the Top End and Central Australia
has led to increased mosquito numbers. There have been 75 Territory-wide
notified cases of RRV disease in January 2001 with 26, 25, and 20 cases in
the Darwin, Barkly, and Katherine districts, respectively. This compares
with 153 cases in the Northern Territory for the whole of last year; in
January 2000, there were 39, 3, and 4 RRV notifications for the same 3
regions, respectively. The reduction in the number of Darwin cases is most
probably due to the effective mosquito control measures in place.
The principal mosquito vectors for RRV are the following: _Aedes vigilax_
("salt marsh mosquito") in the Top End of the Northern Territory (Darwin
Region, East Arnhem, and Katherine District), a salt marsh mosquito
principally occurring within 10km of salt marsh and tidal rivers in late
dry to early wet season (August to January). This mosquito bites day and
night. _Aedes normanensis_, a flood water mosquito principally present for
two weeks following wet season flooding. It is found from subcoastal areas
to midway between Tennant Creek and Alice Springs and bites by day (in
shaded places) and in the evenings and night. _Culex annulirostris_
("common banded mosquito") has a Territory-wide distribution from December
to June. It breeds in shallow permanent and temporary water and bites after
sundown and night. Finally, to a lesser extent, the mosquito _Aedes
notoscriptus_ which breeds in artificial receptacles in urban areas and
bites throughout the day, like _Ae. nomrmanensis_.
Common banded mosquito numbers in the Katherine area are particularly high
at the moment and pose a particular risk. By contrast, the Alice Springs
region has relatively low mosquito numbers and few RRV notifications at the
moment but the recent rain may lead to an increased risk over the next few
weeks. The most effective prevention is to reduce the chance of being
bitten. Care should be taken to avoid getting bitten at any time.
Fortunately, mosquitoes are not normally active in bright sunlight and
protective measures are usually only required to be on hand and used when
mosquitoes are obvious. We do not advise any travel restrictions to the
Northern Territory in spite of these increased numbers of RRV cases.
