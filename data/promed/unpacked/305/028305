(Date of last previously reported outbreak: 1991).
Text of a fax received on 14 March 1998 from Dr Sultan A.S. Khalaf, Deputy
Director General, The Public Authority for Agriculture Affairs and Fish
Resources (PAAF), Safat:
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 15 February 1998.
Estimated date of first infection: 20 January 1998.
Location No. of outbreaks
Abdally 1
Khiran 1
Description of affected population: both flocks comprise intensively farmed
local goats.
Out of a total 369 susceptible animals, there were 174 cases, 160 deaths,
no animals destroyed or slaughtered.
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Serology Laboratory, Animal Health
Department, PAAF.
B. Diagnostic tests used: agar-gel immunodiffusion test and complement
fixation test.
C. Causal agent: Mycoplasma capricolum subspecies. capripneumoniae.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: not known, but the infection is
suspected to have been introduced through carrier animal(s) imported into
the country.
B. Mode of spread: in the case of the flock at Khiran, the infection may
have been introduced by animals bought from the local market on 1 February
1998.
C. Other epidemiological details: it is not uncommon for newly imported
animals to be re-sold at local markets.
Control measures during reporting period: affected animals have been
treated. In the absence of animal identification, tracing back was not
possible. Therefore, a quick surveillance of contagious caprine
pleuropneumonia in goats within the main
livestock production area has been initiated.
