A popular gout medicine has been found to have been contaminated with
a rare fungus that was linked to the deaths of 3 Queen Mary Hospital
[Hong Kong] patients over the past year. In an unscheduled and urgent
press conference, the [Hong Kong] Department of Health warned the
public against using the allopurinol product made by a local
pharmaceutical company after the level of _Mucorales_ fungi found in
samples exceeded the safety limit by 100 times.

Director of Health Lam Ping-yan said his officers are at the
company's production line trying to trace the source of the
contamination. The Hospital Authority is trying to trace all patients
who have been given prescriptions to get them to come in for medicine
exchanges. The department has also notified the medical and
pharmaceutical sectors.

Microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung of University of Hong Kong said wooden
chopsticks were initially believed to be the source of infection but
further investigation shown none of those who died had used the
chopsticks. Yuen said those who have taken the tainted medical product
are unlikely to be at risk if they are healthy. He voiced concern for
those with poor immune systems, especially people who have received
bone marrow transplants, as well as leukemia and lymphoma patients.

_Mucorales_, fungi that are ubiquitously found in the environment,
food and wooden material, can cause mucormycosis in people with
weakened immune systems.

[This posting seems to strongly suggest that contaminated allopurinol,
used to prevent uric acid production in patients with gout and in some
undergoing chemotherapy, was the source of the fungus causing
gastrointestinal mucormycosis. - Mod.LL]
