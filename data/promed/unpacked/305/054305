A 32-year-old young man who worked as a teacher in the Journalism Faculty of the National University of La Plata died yesterday [24 Jan 2013] in the San Martin Hospital of the capital of Buenos Aires province; [his death] is being investigated [to determine] if this was a hantavirus [infection] case.

Hospital sources reported that the Head of Preventive Health Medicine is analyzing this possible case of hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome; HPS], after the man died with a clinical picture of symptoms similar to this disease.

This afternoon samples were sent to the Instituto Malbran, that will confirm [or not] within 10 days if [a] hantavirus [infection] was involved.

According to his co-workers, the man went to work on Wednesday morning in the Faculty that is located in the La Plata Forest [a major park in the city] and later left without offering explanations. That night, he was admitted in to the San Martin Hospital in serious condition with symptoms compatible with [a] hantavirus or leptospirosis [infection].

The young man died yesterday [24 Jan 2013] at 9:00 in the morning after having been interned in an intensive care room.

[Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in this case, or which rodent species were implicated as reservoirs, if this proves to be a HPS case. Several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina, including a suspected case of HPS in La Plata in February 2011. This case may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection that has as its rodent host the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_ (image available at http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg). This virus and rodent are found in central Argentina. The above report does not indicate the locality or ecological setting where the young man might have acquired his infection.
