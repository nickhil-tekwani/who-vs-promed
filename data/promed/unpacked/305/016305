Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N3
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (2)
Outbreak 1: Wandan Township, Pingtung County
Date of start of the outbreak: 11 Jan 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 2000 / 2000 / 2000 / 0 / 0
Affected population: geese

Outbreak 2: Luzhu District, Kaohsiung
Date of start of the outbreak: 12 Jan 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 720 / 387 / 387 / 333 / 0
Affected population: geese

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 2
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 2720 / 2387 / 2387 / 333 / 0
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 87.76 / 87.76 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: Abnormal mortalities were observed in 2 goose farms in Kao-Hsiung City and Ping-Tung County. Local disease control center staff went to these farms to conduct movement restrictions and clinical inspection. Dead geese were taken to the national laboratory (Animal Health Research Institute, AHRI) for diagnosis. Specific RNA of avian influenza virus was detected and subtyped as H5N3 by RT-PCR. Highly pathogenic avian influenza was confirmed by the national laboratory according to sequencing analysis of HA0 cleavage site. All the geese within the infected farms were destroyed or died. Thorough cleaning and disinfection will be conducted after stamping out operation. Surrounding poultry farms within 3 km [about 2 mile] radius of infected farms are under intensified surveillance for 3 months.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 13 Jan 2015 / Positive
Birds / gene sequencing / 15 Jan 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This is the 1st time that highly pathogenic H5N3 avian influenza has been identified in Taiwan.

According to information found in the public media, "Animal Health Research Institute Director-General Tsai Hsiang-jung said the new sub-type of H5N3 is the result of a virus recombination, just like the new variant of H5N2 found on 11 Jan 2015. The 'H5' (hemagglutinin) of the local H5N3 sub-type is 99 percent the same as one seen in South Korea, while the 'N3' (neuraminidase) is 98 percent similar to the H1N3 found in Thai ducks in 2011, the H2N3 found in Mongolian mallards in 2010, and the H5N3 found in wild ducks in Kaohsiung in 2013. The N3 is also 97 percent the same as the H5N3 found in domestic ducks in Hualien in 2013, the expert added" (http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201501160020.aspx).

In October 2014, HPAI H5N3 was reported by China; see comments in ProMED-mail post 20141026.2898069. - Mod.CRD]

[1. Have samples from the diverse recent HPAI isolates been submitted to AI reference labs/ref centre? 2. Has the possibility of introduction of HPAI by imports (legal or otherwise) been investigated/excluded? - Mod.AS
