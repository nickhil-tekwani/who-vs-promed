Quarantine extended in Queensland citrus canker outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
Queensland authorities have confirmed that 42 citrus farms in the state
have received plant material from a nursery at the center of the citrus
canker outbreak. The confirmation means Queensland's major growing area
around Gayndah and Mundubbera is now under the same quarantine arrangements
as Central Queensland.
Jane Paterson reports that over 80 percent of Queensland citrus growers
remain locked out of interstate markets. Despite frantic efforts by
Queensland's Department of Primary Industries, only a handful of Queensland
growers from isolated areas, like Far North Queensland's Atherton
Tablelands, are free to export citrus interstate.
That fruit will need to come from fully-inspected properties, be dipped in
a chlorine or salt solution, and then be inspected by the DPI before
leaving the packing shed. But, for the bulk of Queensland's industry, the
agonizing wait to resume picking continues, and, according to Gayndah
grower, Emma Robinson, there's a real sense of anger amongst growers.
Owners of the affected orchard, Pacific Century Production, sought an
injunction, on Fri 9 Jul 2004, to stop their trees from being destroyed,
but it was withdrawn following out-of-court negotiations with the
Department of Primary Industries. DPI has since begun spraying and chopping
down the 1st of up to 45 000 trees. In the 1st stage, 8000 trees are being
treated with a copper spray to contain the canker when trees are chopped
down and burnt.
General Manager of Plant Health Chris Adriaansen says they're taking every
precaution with equipment used in the process. "It's using both
Departmental equipment that we have brought in from Ayr, and also a private
contractor that we have brought in from on the coast near Rockhampton."
According to Adriaansen, "equipment had to be decontaminated as it moved
onto the block, and we will decontaminate it as it leaves the block." Staff
are maintaining a very close quarantine right across the whole property
with even more stringent measures into areas of known infestation across
the property.
Queensland's government is spending USD 180 000 on an advertising campaign
to shore up citrus sales in the wake of the outbreak.

[The fact that 42 sites are at risk indicates widespread movement of
material from the Pacific Century Production site. The bacterium
_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv _citri_ [Xac] is spread locally primarily by
wind-driven rain, overhead irrigation, and contaminated equipment. Long
distance spread is by movement of infected planting material. Citrus leaf
miner (_Phyllocnistis citrella_) may help spread Xac because of leaf damage
due to mining activity.
