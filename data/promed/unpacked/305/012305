Wilton joins Stamford and Greenwich on the list of Fairfield County municipalities with confirmed cases of H3N2, a newer virulent strain of canine influenza, or "dog flu," that appeared in New York City earlier this year [2018] before making its way into Connecticut.

In a Wed 8 Aug 2018 email, Dr. Jennifer Rosen told The Bulletin that South Wilton Veterinary Group on Danbury Road has had "3 confirmed cases" of H3N2. All 3 cases were in July [2018], the 1st of which was on Wed 11 July 2018, according to the veterinary group's other medical director, Dr. Clare Fahy.

In the USA, there are 2 strains causing dog flu: H3N8 and H3N2. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, H3N8 was 1st reported in the USA in 2004, and H3N2 1st appeared in the USA in 2015. The H3N2 virus appeared in Brooklyn, NY, back in April [2018] and spread across New York City's boroughs before making its way to Connecticut.

Rosen said "the best way to prevent dogs from becoming severely ill" is to vaccinate them against both strains. Dog owners should also "wash their hands and any shared toys after playing or contact with other dogs," she added, and "avoid bringing their dogs to areas where other dogs congregate," such as grooming facilities, dog parks, and doggy day cares.

Dr. Ralph Hunt of the Wilton Hospital for Animals on Danbury Road reported on Thu 9 Aug 2018 that his practice hasn't had any cases of H3N2 but said "there's more precaution with this particular strain." The Office of the State Veterinarian is "trying to be proactive" when it comes to the virus, he said, and is requiring veterinarians to report confirmed cases of canine influenza in the state. The Bulletin reached out to the state veterinarian but did not hear back in time for publication.

There have been no confirmed cases of H3N2 at the Cannondale Animal Clinic on Danbury Road, but the clinic did have 3 dogs come in with coughs "shortly after the outbreak" in Stamford, according to Dr. Paula Belknap.

Two of the dogs were tested and came back negative for H3N2 but positive for _Bordetella_ and mycoplasma, said Belknap, "which contributed to their flu-like signs."

"Both dogs had been previously vaccinated for H3N2 virus," she said, "and I believe it is why they tested negative for H3N2." Belknap said the owner of the 3rd dog declined testing.

According to the Cornell University School of Veterinary Medicine, "virtually all dogs are susceptible" to dog flu, and the onset of signs come 2-3 days after infection. Signs include high fever, coughing, loss of appetite, lethargy, runny nose, and eye discharge. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), not all dogs show signs of illness, and "the severity of illness associated with canine flu in dogs can range from no signs to severe illness."

Dogs with flu signs should be taken to the vet promptly for assessment and treatment. If diagnosed with canine flu, dogs should be kept away from other dogs for at least 3 weeks to prevent spreading the disease.

There are no drugs to treat canine influenza, which means the illness must run its course once a dog is infected. [Supportive treatment may be needed with severely ill animals. - Mod.TG]

While most dogs recover within 2-3 weeks, according to the CDC, "some may develop secondary bacterial infections, which may lead to more severe illness and pneumonia."

[Canine influenza (CI) or dog flu is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by an influenza A virus. In the USA, CI has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The 1st strain reported in the USA, beginning in 2004, was an H3N8 influenza A virus. This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain.

"In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate CI virus, H3N2. The strain causing the 2015 outbreak was almost genetically identical to an H3N2 strain previously reported only in Asia, specifically Korea, China, and Thailand. In Asia, this H3N2 strain is believed to have resulted from the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus -- possibly from among viruses circulating in live bird markets -- to dogs. Since March 2015, thousands of dogs have been confirmed positive for H3N2 CI across the USA" (see https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/FAQs/Pages/Control-of-Canine-Influenza-in-Dogs.aspx).

Healthy dogs can be vaccinated and should be if you must board your animal. There is a vaccine for both strains of the flu mentioned above. If the virus is circulating in your area, avoiding canine social activities (dog parks, play dates, interactions in the park, etc.) may help protect your dog.

Canine influenza viruses (H3N2 and H3N8) are not known to infect humans (see https://www.cdc.gov/flu/canineflu/keyfacts.htm).

This article briefly discussed 3 cases but does not provide any laboratory evidence or substantial data to raise the suspicion of a more virulent strain. It does indicate that 2 dogs had been vaccinated and tested negative, which may mean, as mentioned in the article, that there was infection but not necessarily co-infection with another organism. It may also mean there is a new strain for which there is no identification test currently available. - Mod.TG
