Anthrax has been confirmed in a whitetail deer in southeastern Edwards County. This is the 2nd confirmed case of anthrax in Texas this year [2014], the 1st in a deer.

The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) rules require proper disposal of affected carcasses and vaccination of livestock on the premises prior to release of the quarantine.

Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, which is a naturally occurring organism with worldwide distribution, including certain parts of Texas. It is not uncommon for anthrax to be diagnosed in livestock or wildlife in the southwestern part of the state. A vaccine is available for use in susceptible livestock in high risk areas. Acute fever followed by rapid death with bleeding from body openings are common signs of anthrax in livestock. Carcasses may also appear bloated and decompose quickly. Livestock displaying symptoms consistent with anthrax should be reported to a private veterinary practitioner or a TAHC official. If affected livestock or carcasses must be handled, producers are encouraged to follow basic sanitation precautions such as wearing protective gloves, long sleeve shirts and washing thoroughly afterward to prevent accidental spread of the bacteria to people.

"The TAHC will continue to closely monitor the situation for possible new cases across the state. Producers are encouraged to consult their veterinary practitioner or local TAHC office if they have questions about the disease," said Dr. T.R. Lansford, TAHC Assistant Executive Director for Animal Health Programs.

[We have been getting rumors for about 10 days of a possible anthrax outbreak south of Rocksprings at Barksdale. This TAHC news release would seem to confirm it. With a single deer reported affected, this could be the truth or just the tag information on the submitted sample; i.e. one sample equals one animal. But it has been very dry in West Texas, and in those circumstances, it is not uncommon to just see the sporadic case with little or no secondaries.

With the deer hunting season in distant view, the briefness of this report by the Texas authorities is understandable, as Edwards County is full of commercial deer ranches, with both native (Whitetail deer) and exotics (you name it, someone has it). Last year [2013], there was an outbreak involving sable antelope in a part of eastern Edwards county where the disease had never been seen before; see 20131002.1980336 and 20130927.1972294.

The previous outbreak this summer [2014] was on a goat ranch in Kinney County, north of Bracketville.
