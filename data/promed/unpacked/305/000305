On average there are 40 reported dengue cases daily in Selangor.

From January until 29 Mar 2008, Selangor reported 3743 cases. Of
that figure, 3550 cases of fever were recorded while there were 193
cases of DHF. Deaths suspected to be caused by the viral fever stood at 10.

Selangor Health, Estate Workers Affairs, Poverty Eradication and
Caring Government chairman Dr A. Xavier Jayakumar said the state is
concerned with the alarming number of cases being reported.

"Our immediate aim is to reduce the number of cases. In 2007 we had
32 deaths due to dengue-haemorrhagic fever and now we have 10
suspected deaths due to the viral fever," he said. He added that Shah
Alam city recorded 719 cases from January to 29 March [2008], the
highest in one locality.

"Shah Alam is a modern city, yet you have high statistics. Residents
might say not much is being done to clean up the area. But there
could be some truth to their statement. Again it also involves the
lackadaisical attitude and public's ignorance on how the disease is
spread," he said.

Xavier said construction sites, abandoned buildings, shop lots and
even schools are to be blamed for not checking on areas where water
collected and could be a breeding ground for mosquito larvae.

Three more people lost their lives to dengue between 16 - 22 Mar
[2008], bringing the number of fatalities due to the disease to 8 so
far this year [2008]. The 1st fatality happened in the 3rd week of
January, another 2 in week 2 of February and 2 more in the 1st week of March.

Disease Conrtol Division director Datuk Dr Hasan Abdul Rahman,
however, said despite the fatalites recorded in the 3rd week of
March, the number of cases reported that week showed a drop, from 643
cases in week 2 to 573 cases, which translated into a 10.6 percent decrease.

Of the figure for week 3318 cases or 55.3 percent of the total were
reported in the states of Selangor, Kelantan, Malacca, Negri
Sembilan, Terengganu and the federal territory of Labuan, he said in
a statement here today [26 Mar 2008].

He added that monitoring by district health offices found houses and
shoplots to be the main culprits where breeding of the _Aedes_
mosquito (the [dengue virus] vector) was concerned.

The number of persons recorded this year [2008] to have been affected
by dengue fever in Ilocos Norte has already reached 90 with 2
confirmed to have died from the deadly disease.

The present figure was triple the number recorded in the 1st quarter
of 2007. Batac City was reported to have had the highest number of
cases with 27. Laoag City was 2nd with 12 cases.

Due to this alarming figures, the Region 1 office of the Department
of Health and Ilocos Norte Provincial Health Office are making the
rounds to provide residents of the province with tips to prevent the
spread of the disease.

A new crisis has erupted in the northern war zone with a virtual
epidemic of dengue and chikungunya viral fever among troops due to
the heavy rains and resultant floods, officials said. Military
spokesperson Udaya Nanayakkara said urgent measures had been taken to
check the epidemic, while other officials disclosed that about 500
troops affected by the viral flu were being treated at hospitals in
the Anuradhapura district.

Provincial Health Director Dr. W. Atapattu said the health crisis had
arisen one month ago [end of February 2008] and the victims were
being treated at the Anuradhapura, Padaviya and Sampathnuwara
hospitals. Dr. Atapattu also said health education and viral flu
prevention activities were conducted in the affected areas and
mosquito nets being widely distributed. [Neither dengue nor
chikungunya virus infections are accurately termed "viral flu." That
term should be restricted to influenza virus infections. - Mod.TY]

Other steps are also being taken to check and destroy mosquito
breeding sites. An official said the dengue or chikungunya mosquitoes
were breeding in various places including discarded cases of shells
used in the war.

Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital Director Dr. Sarath Weerabandara said
the outbreak began when unexpected heavy rains hit the area including
the war zones. He said blood samples sent to the Medical Research
Institute had confirmed that the virus was largely chikungunya.

[The virus causing this outbreak was termed "largely chikungunya."
That implies that there was also another virus, perhaps dengue virus
as suggested, involved as well. Since both viruses are transmitted by
the same _Aedes_ mosquito vectors, it is certainly possible that both
chikungunya and dengue viruses are being transmitted at the same time
in the same place. ProMED would appreciate information concerning
confirmation (or not) of dengue virus(es) being involved in this
outbreak. ProMED post 20080328.1154 reported the death of 4
individuals in the same area during the week of 17 Mar 2008, with
mention of a similar non-fatal disease outbreak among the military
troops in the area. Although the cause of death was not determined,
nor was the description of the clinical disease detailed enough to
speculate on the etiological agent involved, previous repots of
fatalities from dengue fever with cardiac manifestations occurred
during a dengue outbreak in the same area in 2005.

(Please note that this same information was posted in Chikungunya
(10): Sri Lanka 20080330.1185 as it refers to an outbreak of
predominantly chikungunya, although the mention of dengue, combined
with the earlier posting on undiagnosed deaths most likely
attributable to dengue fever justifies it being included in this
dengue update.)

Dengue Fever in a traveller returning from the Maldives.
------------------------------------------------------
A 49 year-old male German traveller who stayed for 10 days on the
Maldives fell ill one day after return to Germany (21 Mar 2008) with
fever (39.7C [103.46 F]), headache, and myalgia. He presented to an
emergency room and was treated with oseltamivir. On 25 Mar [2008] he
was referred to the Department of Tropical Medicine at University of
Munich showing fever, petechial bleeding of the gum, leucocytopenia
(2.800/mu l), and thrombocytopenia (70.000/mu l). A plasma sample was
tested at the Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology and a positive
dengue real-time-RT-PCR and a negative chikungunya real-time-RT-PCR
were found. Typing of the causative dengue virus serotype is underway.

A dengue outbreak on the Maledives was reported in 2006 (ProMED
20060318.0834). This case of a returning traveller points to a
significant circulation of dengue virus on the Maldives in 2008 again.

Dengue fever cases in New Caledonia are continuing to soar with at
least 263 known cases since the beginning of this year [2008], the
local government said in a release on Friday [28 Mar 2008].

Oceania Flash reports that New Caledonia's dengue fever epidemic was
officially declared in February 2008.

Most of the known cases are concentrated in the capital Noumea and
its greater area, as well as other reported hotbeds in the
northeastern island of Lifou (part of the Loyalty group) and on the
Isle of Pines (South of the capital Noumea), local media report.

Health authorities in New Caledonia had [in] late February [2008]
upgraded the status of what was formerly a "pre-epidemic" situation
to a fully fledged "epidemic" with regards to dengue, mosquito-borne,
hemorrhagic fever.

In view of the apparent momentum of the epidemic, health minister
Sylvie Robineau has announced she will on Monday [31 Mar 2008] lead a
team of experts (including health and social affairs directors) to
visit the northeastern island of Lifou, which is part of the Loyalty
islands group.

The mission's objective is to assess the situation, but also to
reinforce the prevention message and measures with the local
population. The island is said to be one of the most severely
affected with 88 cases.

Robineau said the situation on Lifou was now a matter of urgency and
her government has moved to earmark special funds to purchase
mosquito repellents to be distributed to Lifou villagers free of
charge via rural health centres.

Since the outbreak of the epidemic in early February [2008], the
number of cases has steadily increased: there were only 72 cases at
the beginning of March, 165 cases mid-March and over 215 cases on 20 Mar 2008.

New Caledonia's health and prevention department is up in arms,
calling on the population to be more responsible in their efforts to
clean their own backyards from any potential mosquito breeding site
such as still water contained in old tyres and plant pots or any
bushy area on their compound that could also become a nest for mosquito larvae.

Health services have also stepped up their prevention and awareness
campaign against the potentially deadly virus.

They have once again stressed the situation is serious, mainly
because of the heavy rains and the hot and humid conditions currently
affecting New Caledonia.

As part of the prevention campaign, Noumea's health and hygiene
services have also deployed dozens of officers, whose main task is to
visit house and property owners and convince them to clean up.

An earlier dengue fever epidemic, in 2003, killed as many as 20
persons in New Caledonia.

The Epidemiological Week (EW) 11 [09-15 Mar 2008], the Regional
Directorate of Health (DIRESA) reported 216 cases of classical dengue
fever to the Department of Epidemiology (EDM), 85 percent of the
cases were reported by: Loreto (49 percent) Lambayeque (16 percent),
Ucayali (8 percent), Amazon (7 percent).and Luciano Castillo (5
percent). To date 14 health directorates have provided notification
of confirmed [dengue] cases.

Up through EW 11 (2008) 3840 dengue cases have been reported to the
OGE (General Epidemiology Office), of which 622 cases have been
confirmed by laboratory test (IgM ELISA).

As for cases of DHF, 3 cases have been confirmed this week; none
died. The cumulative incidence [of DHF] in the country through EW 11
is 13.80 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. The Departments [state of
province equivalents] with the highest incidence are: Loreto
(220.49), Ucayali (95.96), St. Maarten (32.28), Lima (26.15) Madre de
Dios (13.84), La Libertad (21.18), Jaen (17.06) and Amazon (46.34).
The departments that were experiencing [dengue] outbreaks in EW 11
are: Loreto, Lambayeque, Amazon and Piura II.

The Loreto DIRESA notes a trend of decline in the number of [dengue]
cases. Motupe, and Olmos and Bagua initiated actions for the control
of outbreaks.

In 2008 2 children died of DHF; these cases are under investigation.
The information is from the Director-Chairman of the Foundation for
Surveillance in Health (SVM), Evandro Melo. This number is equal to
[the number of fatal DHF cases] registered during the entire year of 2007.

According to Melo, the deaths occurred in children of 7 years [of
age]. The cases were registered in the first 2 months of the year
[Jan / Feb 2008]. According to the records of SVM, children who died
were living in Manaus and there have been no suspected [dengue]
deaths in the interior of the state.

Data on the disease recorded by the state Secretary of Health will be
released today [14 Mar 2008] on the balance sheet of the operation
"Impact" to combat dengue. The operation began 2 weeks ago and is
being carried out in partnership with the fire brigade and the armed forces.

[In response to a report that dengue virus 4 (DEN - 4) was
circulating in Manaus, Dr. Pedro Tauil, a respected Brazilian
virologist, wrote to ProMED-PORT as follows: It is very strange that,
having a population completely non-immune to DEN-4 [virus], this
virus has not generated a great epidemic and also, since then
(October 2007) was not detected any more. Additionally, the national
reference laboratories, the Institute Evandro Chagas and Fiocruz
[Oswaldo Cruz Foundation], have not confirmed this positive [DEN-4
result] in samples [they] examined. - Mod.JW]

[The Adjunct Secretary of Health Surveillance of the Brazilian
Ministry of Health, Fabiano Pimenta, on 27 Mar 2008 officially
rejected the report that DEN-4 virus had entered Brazil. The agent in
question was DEN-3 virus, not DEN-4 virus. However, he considers that
the entry of DEN-4 virus in Brazil is inevitable, considering that it
is circulating in neighboring countries, such as Venezuela, Ecuador
and Honduras. His comments were reported in UOL Ciencias e Saude [in

Since 01 Jan 2008 the Brazilian health authorities have reported 406
DHF cases, with 34 deaths nationally. There is a noteworthy increase
in [dengue] cases in various states in the country compared to the
same period in 2007; Amazonas (an increase of 9.8 times), Rondonia
(5.3 times), Sergipe (4.7 times), Bahia (3.4 times), Rio Grande do
Norte (2.8 times), Para (2.5 times) y Rio de Janeiro (2.2 times).

The state of Rio de Janeiro has reported 32 615 cases of dengue fever
corresponding to 38 percent of the total cases reported in the
country), and 245 cases of DHF. Of those affected, a change in
serious cases has been observed. Of the 2116 hospitalized cases, 53
were children under 14 years [of age]. Of the total registered
deaths, 20 were due to DHF, 8 to dengue shock syndrome, and 19 from
complications of dengue [virus] infection. More than 50 percent of
the deaths occurred in children 2-13 years old. The increase in the
number of registered deaths suggests that there has been a greater
evolution in severity of clinical manifestations than was expected.
