[1] Pakistan - Karachi: violence against vaccination teams

Gunmen kill anti-polio workers in Pakistan
------------------------------------------
A total of 5 Pakistani women and a man were killed on Tuesday [18 Dec 2012] in separate attacks on health workers participating in a national drive to eradicate polio from Pakistan. The attacks forced health officials to temporarily suspend a large polio vaccination drive in Karachi, the country's most populous city, where the disease has been making a worrisome comeback in recent years.

Saghir Ahmed, the health minister for southern Sindh Province, said he had ordered the 24 000 aid workers taking part in the campaign in Karachi to immediately stop work. It was not clear when they would resume.

The shooting represented a brutal setback to polio immunization efforts in Pakistan, one of just 3 countries in the world where the disease remains endemic. Pakistan accounted for 198 new cases last year -- the highest rate in the world, followed by Afghanistan and Nigeria.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Taliban insurgents have repeatedly vowed to target anti-polio workers, accusing them of being spies. In the tribal areas along the Afghan border, Taliban leaders have issued religious edicts declaring that the United States runs a spy network under the guise of vaccination programs.

That perception was strengthened after the American commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden in June 2011, when it emerged that the Central Intelligence Agency had paid a Pakistani doctor to run a vaccination program in Abbottabad, where Bin Laden was hiding, in a bid to obtain DNA evidence from his family. Pakistani authorities arrested the doctor, shortly after the American raid, and he has been sentenced to 33 years in prison.

Despite the negative perceptions, the government has pressed ahead with a large polio vaccination campaign, usually conducted in 3-day spurts involving tens of thousands of health workers who administer medicine to children under 5.

The shootings on Tuesday [18 Dec 2012] came on the 2nd day of the latest drive, which has now been called off in Karachi. After an attack on a United Nations doctor from Ghana in Karachi last July [2012], officials were braced for some sort of militant resistance. But the extent and scale of the attacks Tuesday [18 Dec 2012] caught the government by surprise.

In the attacks in Karachi, 3 teams of health volunteers were targeted in poor neighborhoods: Landhi, Orangi, and Baldia Town.

Two female aid workers were killed in an attack in Landhi, according to local news reports. In Orangi, unknown gunmen opened fire on a health team, killing one woman and a male volunteer. Another female worker was killed in nearby Baldia Town.

The Karachi neighborhoods where aid workers were targeted Tuesday [18 Dec 2012] are being used as safe havens by militants, who have escaped American drone strikes in North and South Waziristan tribal regions, according to police officials. Security forces regularly conduct search operations in these neighborhoods.

In the north western city of Peshawar, gunmen riding a motorcycle opened fire on 2 sisters who had volunteered to help administer polio drops, killing one.

The attacks on polio workers followed a bold Taliban assault on a major Pakistan Air Force base in Peshawar over the weekend that killed at least 15 people and a militant bomb attack in a nearby tribal village on Monday [17 Dec 2012] that killed another 19.

For Pakistan's beleaguered progressives, the attack on female health workers was another sign of how the country's extremist fringe would stoop to attack the vulnerable and minorities.

"Ahmadis, Shias, Hazaras, Christians, child activists, doctors, anti-polio workers -- who's next on the target list, Pakistan?" asked Mira Hashmi, a lecturer in film studies at the Lahore School of Economics, in a post on Twitter.

Balochistan govt suspends anti-polio campaign
---------------------------------------------
The Balochistan government has suspended its anti-polio campaign in the province in the aftermath of attacks on polio workers in Karachi and Peshawar on Tuesday (18 Dec 2012), an official told DawnNews. Noorul Haq Baloch, the focal person of Balochistan government on polio, said the campaign was suspended for an indefinite period in Quetta, Killa Abdullah, and Pishin districts.

"The reason behind suspension of the campaign is security threat to workers," said Baloch. He said so far 4 confirmed cases of polio were reported in Balochistan this year (2012). Baloch said 11 cases of polio 2 virus were reported in Balochistan.

"Polio 2 virus is curable and can be treated within 3 months," he said [this is an erroneous statement, the only "cure" for polio is to prevent the infection by vaccination. - Mod.MPP]

He said last year 73 cases of polio virus were reported in Balochistan.

The Balochistan Health Department in collaboration with World Health Organization, had decided to restart an anti-polio campaign from [24-28 Dec 2012] in Quetta, Killa Abdullah and Pishin districts. The campaign has now been suspended.

A polio volunteer was killed in Eastern By Pass area of Quetta a month ago [November 2012]. His killers are still at large.

Militants have frequently issued warnings to anti-polio teams in different districts of the sparsely populated province of the country.

WHO and UNICEF condemn attacks on health workers in Pakistan
------------------------------------------------------------
WHO and UNICEF join the Government of Pakistan and the provinces of Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in condemning the multiple attacks that have killed 6 health workers in the past 24 hours.

At least 6 people working on a polio vaccination campaign have been reported shot dead in several locations in Pakistan -- Gadap, Landi, Baldia, and Orangi towns of Karachi city, Sindh Province and Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. Those killed were among thousands who work selflessly across Pakistan to eradicate polio.

The Government of Pakistan and the affected provinces have temporarily suspended the vaccination campaign due to concerns over safety of health workers.

Such attacks deprive Pakistan's most vulnerable populations -- especially children -- of basic life-saving health interventions. We call on the leaders of the affected communities and everyone concerned to do their utmost to protect health workers and create a secure environment so that we can meet the health needs of the children of Pakistan.

Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus that can cause permanent paralysis in a matter of hours. Safe and effective vaccines protect children from the disease. Currently the disease remains endemic in only 3 countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan.

WHO, UNICEF, and all their partners in Pakistan and globally express their deepest sympathy to the families of the health workers. We remain committed to supporting the Government of Pakistan and the people of Pakistan in their efforts to rid the country of polio and other diseases.

[4] Pakistan - Balochistan: 10 new cases
Date: 13 Dec 2012

10 new polio cases reported in Balochistan
------------------------------------------
The exertions of the Balochistan government to save the children from the crippling polio disease have turned abortive as at least 10 new cases of the crippling virus, like that of a 2 year old [male], have been reported in the province in the last few weeks.

Of them 9 cases have been reported from the districts of Kila Abdullah Khan and one from Pishin, officials of the World Health Organization (WHO) confided while talking to The News on Wednesday [12 Dec 2012]. Apart from these, 4 cases of wild polio virus of type 1 had been reported in the province this year [2012]. Official sources confided that on Wednesday last [?5 Dec 2012], the last day of the 1st of 3 special anti-polio campaigns, 7530 families refused to administer the anti-polio drops to their children in Quetta, Kila Abdullah and Pishin districts. Of them, 2794 families refused at Quetta, 2788 refusal cases reported at Pishin, while 1948 families refused in Kila Abdullah.

It is worth mentioning here that the infectious disease has been eliminated in developed nations but persists in parts of Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.

Pakistan reported 56 cases of the crippling virus in 2012 that had been reduced from 199 in 2011, while Afghanistan has reported 38. Most of the Afghan and Pakistani cases have occurred along their porous border.

In its report, the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) of global polio eradication initiative, has recommended the International Health Regulations Expert Review Committee to issue urgently a standing recommendation by May 2013 that will introduce pre-travel vaccination or vaccination checks in Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan until national transmission is stopped. "No country should allow a citizen from any endemic polio state to cross their border without a valid vaccination certificate," the IMB recommendations added.

Soon after the IMB report, a high-level meeting was held with the chief minister of Balochistan, Nawab Muhammad Aslam Raisani, in the chair last week. It decided to launch 3 special polio campaigns in the polio-affected areas. It has been [learned] that the ways and means were discussed to eradicate the polio completely from the province. The chief minister expressed his dismay over the presence of the increased number of polio cases in the province. He, on the occasion, said the government would mobilise all its available resources and manpower to achieve the target of "Polio-free Balochistan".

The chief minister said though effective steps are being taken for eradication of the crippling disease in the province, there is still much room to do a lot to achieve complete success in this regard.

On the occasion, the chief secretary expressed the resolve to eradicate the disease from the province saying that the major reason behind the new outbreak is the administrative issue, which needs to be resolved. He directed that it must be ensured to administer the anti-polio drops to every kid in the affected districts.

*Data in WHO as of 13 Dec 2011 for 2011 data and 11 Dec 2012 for 2012 data

Two polio vaccinators were killed in Afghanistan last week [week ending 5 Dec 2012] in separate incidents, underlining the dangerous conditions that health and humanitarian workers face in many countries. These tragic events further underline the truly heroic and courageous efforts of the frontline health workers, often working under very dangerous conditions, all in efforts to protect children from lifelong polio-paralysis.

Afghanistan
- One new WPV case was reported in the past week (WPV1 from Hilmand), bringing the total number of WPV cases for 2012 to 34. It is the most recent case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on [19 Nov 2012].
- The Inter-Ministerial Task Force held its 1st meeting on [11 Dec 2012] chaired by the deputy minister and co-chaired by focal person for polio eradication.
- Preparations are ongoing for the December Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs), to be conducted in 14 high-risk districts and some border districts from [16-19 Dec 2012].
- OPV (oral polio vaccine) was administered as part of a measles campaign began in 18 provinces, which began on [1 Dec 2012].

Nigeria
- 7 new WPV cases were reported in the past week (2 cases of WPV1 from Katsina, 1 WPV1 from Kaduna, 1 WPV1 from Kano, 1 WPV1 from FCT, 1 WPV3 from Taraba, and 1 WPV3 from Yobe), bringing the total number of WPV cases for 2012 to 118. The WPV1 from Kaduna is the most recent in the country and had onset of paralysis on [17 Nov 2012].
- The 2 new WPV3 cases reported are particularly concerning, as Nigeria is now the only country in the world reporting cases due to this strain over the past 6 months. Taraba's previous WPV3 case dates back to July [2012], and a comprehensive outbreak response is urgently needed.
- Trivalent OPV was added to Child Health Days (with meningitis vaccine) from [1-10 Dec 2012], and subnational Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) will be conducted using bivalent OPV (15-18 Dec 2012). This will be an opportunity to administer 2 additional doses of OPV to children in highest-risk areas, within the space of a single month.

Pakistan
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recently reported WPV case occurred in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (WPV1) with onset of paralysis on [10 Nov 2012]. The total number of WPV cases for 2012 remains 56.
- However, 2 new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week from Killa Abdullah in Balochistan, bringing the total number of cVDPV2 cases to 12 (all from the greater Quetta area of Balochistan).
- Response vaccination activities began in all Union-Councils of the Killa Abdullah district this week. Trivalent OPV was used for all union councils except for one team in Boghra that used bivalent OPV. After this campaign is concluded, the micro-plan for Killa Abdullah will be updated.
- An All Political Parties Conference was held in Killa Abdullah on [6 Dec 2012] to sustain the support of all political parties for polio eradication campaigns in the district. The conference provided an opportunity to share the current situation of polio eradication in the district, dispel misconceptions regarding immunization and encourage the parties to actively participate in the upcoming campaigns. Members of 9 political parties participated in the event.
- Preparations for SNIDs scheduled for [17-19 Dec 2012] are underway.
- The Polio Eradication Technical Advisory Group meeting is scheduled for [14-15 Dec 2012] in Islamabad.

Angola
- No new cases were reported in the past week. No cases have been reported in 2012. The country reported a total of 5 cases in 2011, and the last case had onset of paralysis on [7 Jul 2011] in Uige in the country's north.
- SNIDs with trivalent OPV were conducted on [7-10 Dec 2012].

Chad
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recently reported WPV case occurred in the Lac region (WPV1) with onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012]. The total number of WPV cases for 2012 remains 5.
- One new cVDPV2 case was reported in the past week, bringing the total number of cVDPV2 cases to 12.
- Staggered SNIDs were conducted on [23-25 Nov 2012] in the south and east and were conducted on [9-11 Dec 2012] in the north and west, using trivalent OPV. Staggering activities allows the redeployment of all available technical staff to support the activity in various areas.
- Efforts are ongoing to strengthen subnational surveillance sensitivity, with trainings of health centers staff in key areas being conducted.

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. No WPV cases have been reported in 2012. The total number of WPV cases for 2011 is 93 (all WPV1). The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [20 Dec 2011] in Maniema province.
- Although the country has not reported a WPV case since December 2011, it has been affected by a cVDPV2 outbreak in Katanga province in 2012, with 17 cases reported (most recent case: (4 Apr 2012). Efforts are focused on ensuring the cVDPV2 outbreak is fully stopped.
- Following recent insecurity, most UN staff has now returned to Goma. However, the security situation continues to be evaluated.
- A polio campaign for 27 Nov 2012 was postponed in North Kivu. OPV is also being added to measles campaigns and other humanitarian interventions planned in internally-displaced persons (IDPs) camps.

Horn of Africa
- Efforts are continuing to stop an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak in Kenya and parts of Somalia (in a Somali refugee camp in Dadaab, Kenya, and Kismayo, south-central Somalia).
- Immunizations of older age groups have taken place in Dadaab. In Somalia, campaigns have been conducted in border areas with Kenya and Ethiopia, and in some areas of central Somalia (access allowing).
- Across the region, OPV continues to be added to broader humanitarian response activities.
- New tactics are being explored to further boost immunity levels in and around inaccessible areas of south-central Somalia. Potential activities include focusing on people in transit to/from inaccessible areas, using local negotiators to allow safe passage of vaccination teams to inaccessible areas, and immunizing populations bordering inaccessible areas.

West Africa
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. No WPV cases have been reported in 2012. The total number of WPV cases for 2011 in West Africa remains 51 (36 from Cote d'Ivoire, 3 from Guinea, 7 from Mali, and 5 from Niger). The most recent case from the region (WPV1 from Niger) had onset of paralysis on [22 Dec 2011].
- SIAs in Benin with Vitamin A and deworming tablets were conducted from [7-9 Dec 2012].
- OPV continues to be added to broader humanitarian response activities across the region.

[The above series of reports highlights the challenges to a final interruption of poliovirus (both wild and vaccine derived) transmission/circulation in the 3 remaining polio endemic countries in the world -- Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria. In both Afghanistan and Pakistan unacceptable violence has been directed at polio vaccination teams, resulting in the deaths of 8 polio campaign workers over the past few weeks. The room for international outcry and action is there. It is totally incomprehensible to this moderator how these violent acts can be directed at humanitarian workers whose sole "infraction" is trying to eradicate a disease responsible for death and disability of predominantly children in these countries.

If one looks at the global polio update as of 12 Dec 2012 from the Polio Eradication Initiative (in section [5] above] one sees that at present the only countries where there are documented wild poliovirus (WPV) cases are the 3 remaining polio endemic countries -- Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. But, there continue to be paralytic polio cases associated with infection from circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) this year (2012) in Kenya, Somalia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Yemen, Chad and the 3 remaining polio endemic countries -- Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. As mentioned in previous polio posts, both WPV and cVDPV circulation occur in areas where there are suboptimal polio vaccination coverages. The challenges have been to sustain high levels of polio vaccination coverage after WPV transmission has been interrupted in an area and the population no longer sees an urgency in vaccinating their children as the disease appears no longer to be a threat.

The obvious concerns here are that while presently the only countries with documented WPV transmission are the 3 remaining polio endemic countries, the danger of reintroduction of WPV to other countries whose vaccination coverages have declined is ever present (and has occurred through the years -- recurrent cases in other African countries, Indonesia, China to name a few of the instances in the not too distant past).
