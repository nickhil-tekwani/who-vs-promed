There is hope for the "lemon of the north." A 3-year research project will look for causes of the massive dieback of sea buckthorn in Germany. Collaborators include state and regional plant protection authorities, as well as the federal Julius-Kuhn-Institut for Plant Protection in Fruit Crops and Viticulture (JKI-OW).

The dieback is particularly severe in northern areas, where up to half of the shrubs have died in some plantations. The problem decreases towards the south of the country. Samples will be collected from commercial plantings and subjected to molecular analysis for a range of pathogens. Pathogenicity tests will also be carried out under controlled conditions in glasshouses to observe possible effects of some pathogens and external stress factors on the plants, to compare them with the dieback symptoms in the field. In addition, screening of current crop varieties for susceptibility to the dieback will take place.

The disease has increased drastically in northern Germany over the last several years. It occurs both in plantings and wild populations, which would suggest that it is not due to a recently introduced pathogen. Environmental factors are suspected to contribute to the problem. Sea buckthorn diebacks reported from other countries, such as China or Russia, do not seem to be identical in symptom development and timing.

[Sea buckthorn (or sea berry, _Hippophae rhamnoides_) is widely grown in cold-temperate areas of the northern hemisphere. Its berries are high in vitamin C and are used for food or in beverages. The shrubs can grow in saline or sandy soils and are being included in revegetation and environmental rehabilitation programmes.

A number of wilts and dieback diseases of sea buckthorn due to a range of fungi (including _Fusarium_ and _Verticillium_ spp.) have been reported. Some of these fungi have been found associated with a "dried-shrink" disease of the crop reported from China. Identification and reliable diagnosis of pathogens and/or environmental factors contributing to the problem will be essential for management of the disease in Germany. The project described above addresses these aspects and may be expected to provide new information on diebacks of sea buckthorn.
