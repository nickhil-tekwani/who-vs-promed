Children's Hospital Colorado is heightening its surveillance for enterovirus D68 to quickly detect any circulation of the virus, which last summer and fall caused a devastating nationwide outbreak of severe respiratory illness among children and young adults. The outbreak, which erupted in mid-August [2014] and continued through January 2015, also was associated with rare cases of polio-like partial paralysis of limbs, including 13 young patients treated in Colorado.

Children's Hospital has adopted a new diagnostic test -- very rapid, sensitive and specific to EV-D68 -- developed by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. "We have adopted that assay for our surveillance at Children's Hospital so we can tell when EV-D68 is circulating again in Denver and be prepared if cases surge again this year [2015]," said Dr. Kevin Messacar, an infectious disease specialist. Last year [2014], the only tests available for EV-D68 early in the onslaught of cases required days for sequencing of the viral DNA and very limited amounts of testing occurred at the time, Messacar said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eventually did develop a faster assay. But Washington University, which had more time to refine its technique, recently provided a testing method that is perhaps a little more sensitive, able to detect even small amounts of the virus, Messacar said.

In 2014, the CDC and public health labs confirmed 1153 cases in 49 states and the District of Columbia -- almost all among children -- but officials acknowledged there likely were millions of EV-D68 infections never treated or tested. "We think that number is likely a vast underestimate of the burden of the disease," Messacar said. "We had 100 samples confirmed of EV-D68 at Children's. But so few samples got tested. We looked at how busy we had been during that season, August through October [2014], over the last 3 years. It looks like we had 1000 extra visits in 2014. And many sought care but were not tested. And there were so many other cases that were mild, and (the children) never came to the hospital."

By contrast, respiratory cases with high fevers that later developed partial paralysis -- called acute flaccid myelitis -- were rare, Messacar said. From 2 Aug 2014 to 14 Apr 2015, CDC verified reports of 118 children in 34 states meeting their definition. The CDC continues to investigate, along with hospitals and labs nationwide, the connection of the condition with EV-D68.

Messacar said Children Hospital Colorado has set up a multidisciplinary clinic of physicians, neurologists, rehabilitation experts and occupational and physical therapists for the children, whose symptoms range from mild impairment of limbs to full paralysis. "They have made some gains in terms of strengthening surrounding muscles, but most of the children have some residual deficits ranging from mild to very significant in the muscles affected," Messacar said.

[It remains to be established whether this newly-developed assay will have any greater sensitivity than existing assays, and will resolve the role of human enterovirus D68 in childhood diseases. - Mod.CP]

[The connection between EV-D68 and acute flaccid myelitis remains unproven. The outbreaks were temporally related and enteroviruses are known to cause this syndrome (e.g. poliomyelitis), but no definite connection was established. For the CDC take on this, see:
