A microscopic fungus native to Australia and blamed for the death of people
and animals in British Columbia is now linked to the deaths of porpoises
and at least one cat in Washington state.
Necropsies have that shown that _Cryptococcus gattii_, first detected in
the region on Vancouver Island in 1999, was the cause of death in 6
porpoises and a cat in the state, Washington's former public health
veterinarian, Almira Jane Leslie, told The Herald of Everett.
The cat that died and 2 others that were infected with the fungus last year
[2005] were in Whatcom County, which borders British Columbia, and the
porpoises were among 25 that have died in Washington state and British
Columbia since 1999, Leslie said.
Except for a few isolated cases in animals in aquariums, doctors and
veterinarians said it was the first time the fungus, which is invisible to
the naked eye, has been documented in the United States.
It is typically found in eucalyptus trees in the tropics of Australia but
also grows on other trees and can drift or be blown into water as leaves
dry out. Since the fungus was discovered in Canada, it has been blamed for
the deaths of at least 4 people, all in British Columbia.
Dogs, llamas, ferrets, pet birds, and horses also have been infected, and
authorities at the British Columbia Center for Disease Control estimate
that 25 people become sick with cryptococcus infection in the province
annually.
Fungal treatments are available, and medical experts do not believe it is
contagious. "It is a rare disease here, and possibly an emerging disease,"
said Leslie, who recently became an adjunct professor at Washington State
University.
The means by which _Cryptococcus gattii_ reached North America remain
unclear. Theories include a ship, a eucalyptus tree, and the bottom of
someone's shoes. Another possibility is that the fungus was long present in
British Columbia but became a threat to animals only with warmer weather,
said Stephen A Raverty, a veterinary pathologist with the Animal Health
Center in Abbotsford, British Columbia, just north of Sumas, Washington.
"Part of the hypothesis is that because of increasing global temperatures,
the environmental conditions are better," Raverty said.
Laboratory tests indicate the fungus can reproduce in salt water, and
Raverty said porpoises probably become infected when tainted water enters
their blow holes. Scientists are trying to determine whether the porpoises
found dead in Washington state became sick in US waters or in Canada. "It's
difficult to really put this in context if there's a point source of
exposure or if there (are) multiple places where these animals are
exposed," Raverty said. "We expect the latter, though."
The Whatcom County cats all had different owners and apparently had not
been north of the border, Leslie said. "We think the cats acquired the
illness in Washington state, and that would be a first," she said.
County health officer Dr Gregory H Stern told the Everett newspaper he has
asked local doctors to test patients with prolonged coughing, fever, severe
headaches, weight loss, and night sweats, all signs of _Cryptococcus
gattii_ infection.

[I am endebted to the University of Adelaide's website for the following
details about _Cryptococcus gattii_:
" _Cryptococcus gattii_ is an encapsulated basidiomycete yeast-like fungus
with a predilection for the respiratory and nervous system of humans and
animals. _C. gattii_ is distinguishable from _C. neoformans_ biochemically
and by molecular techniques.
"The distribution of cryptococcosis due to _Cryptococcus gattii_ is
geographically restricted; non-immunocompromised hosts are usually
affected, large mass lesions in lung and/or brain (cryptococcomas) are
characteristic, and morbidity from neurological disease is high. Human
disease is endemic in Australia, Papua New Guinea, parts of Africa, the
Mediterranean region, India, South East Asia, Mexico, Brazil, Paraguay, and
Southern California.
"Environmental isolations, initially from the Barossa Valley in South
Australia, have established that _C. gattii_ has a specific ecological
association with _Eucalyptus camaldulensis_, a species of red gum widely
distributed in mainland Australia. Subsequently, another species of red gum
_E. tereticornis_ was confirmed as a natural habitat. This species has a
more restricted distribution occurring along the eastern coastal seaboard
of Australia, extending to Papua New Guinea. More recently, high
concentrations of _C. gattii_ have been isolated from single specimens of 3
additional eucalypts, _Eucalyptus rudis_ (flooded gum), _E. gomphocephala_
(tuart) and _E. blakelyi_ (Blakely's red gum).
"Three of these species (_E. camaldulensis_, _E. tereticornis_ and _E.
gomphocephala_)_ have been exported to several countries in which human
disease due to _C. gattii_ has been reported, though the association is not
exact. Outside of Australia limited isolations of _C. gattii_ have been
made from _E. camaldulensis_ trees growing in California, Apulia, Italy and
in northern India. Evidence for an epidemiological association between this
cryptococcal habitat and human infection is circumstantial. There is
correlation between the global distribution of human infection with _C.
gattii_ and the 5 species of eucalypts, and environmental searches
conducted in Australia and elsewhere have so far failed to identified any
other natural source.
"In Australia, 92 per cent of human isolates and all of those from koalas
(a native animal which lives in close association with eucalypts) and from
all 5 host eucalypts identified to date (i.e. _E. camaldulensis_, _E.
tereticornis_, _E. rudis_ and _E. gomphocephala_) exhibit the same genetic
fingerprint (VGI) when identified by random amplification of polymorphic
DNA (RAPD) and PCR fingerprinting. This finding is consistent with an
epidemiological association between mammalian disease and exposure to host
eucalypts. However, the occurrence of human _C. gattii_ infection in other
countries which lack the host trees, and our own observations of a distinct
genetic type (VGII) in certain locations in Australia, suggest that
additional environmental niches for this fungus are yet to be discovered."
<http://www.mycology.adelaide.edu.au/Fungal_Descriptions/Yeasts/Cryptococcus/C_gattii.html>.
Since the US has koalas and imports eucalypts and since the fungus has been
isolated from areas in California, one has to wonder whether this is a
natural extension of the fungus, or whether we are simply becoming more
adept at diagnosing it. - Mod.TG]
