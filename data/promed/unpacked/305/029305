Chronic wasting disease may be spreading
-----------------------------------------------------------
MADISON, Ill., Sep 20, 2002 (United Press International via COMTEX) --
Wisconsin natural resources officials Friday worried chronic wasting disease
has spread from the initial outbreak area near Madison to infect deer in
other parts of the state. The Department of Natural Resources said a
white-tailed buck shot on a game farm in Portage County tested positive for
the disease, which is similar to mad cow in cattle. Discussions were under
way on whether to speed up plans to test the deer population throughout the
state.
The infected deer was killed Sept. 4 by a hunter on a preserve. Officials
said the buck is believed the first captive deer to test positive for the
disease in the nation. Previously only captive elk had tested positive for
chronic wasting disease. Investigators have not yet determined the infected
animal's movements or whether the hunter processed meat.
The game farm has been quarantined, along with another game farm in Walworth
County. It has not yet been determined whether all the animals will be
destroyed.
There are 946 game farms in Wisconsin, where hunters pay up to $100 to hunt.
The farms have more than 35,000 animals, many of which came from Nebraska,
Colorado and Saskatchewan, where chronic wasting disease first surfaced.
Investigators have been eyeing game farms as a possible source of the
disease in the wild deer population.
The state authorized four off-season deer hunts to kill 25,000 animals in a
bid to stop the disease from spreading from the initial outbreak area near
Mount Horeb, where 31 infected deer have been found. In Minnesota, the
Animal Health Board said Thursday officials will destroy the remaining 48
elk on a farm where the state's first case of chronic wasting disease was
discovered last month. The animals will be shipped from a farm in Aitkin,
Minn., to the University of Minnesota's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in
St. Paul, where they will be tested and destroyed. Brain-stem samples will
be sent to the U.S. Agriculture Department lab in Ames, Iowa.
Like mad cow in cattle and scrapie in sheep, chronic wasting disease is
caused by abnormal proteins that attack the brain and nervous system,
causing weight loss and behavioral changes. Researchers have not yet figured
out how chronic wasting disease is spread or whether it is transmittable to
humans.
No cases of chronic wasting disease have been found in Minnesota's wild deer
population. [Yet. - Mod.MHJ]
