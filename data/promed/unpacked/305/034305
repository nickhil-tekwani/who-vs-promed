Dengue, case fatality rate 980520221932

My long standing impression is that the case fatality rate [regarding
dengue is directly related to the clinical experience and skill of the
attending physician, especially in pediatric cases. I was working in PAHO
when the large Cuban outbreak began in 1981. Cuba requested PAHO guidance
for treatment. We contracted experienced clinicians from Thailand to go to
Cuba to provide clinical training for patient management and PAHO
subsequently produced a clinical management guideline based on Thai
experience. As I recall, Cuba was able to keep the case fatality rate
remarkably low.

[Given the low reported case:fatality rate in the recent experience, it
seems as though the Cubans are still using these techniques and that they
are effective. - Mod.CHC
