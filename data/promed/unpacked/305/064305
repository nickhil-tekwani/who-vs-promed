An epidemic of highly infectious gastroenteritis, which is due mainly to
norovirus infection, is spreading rapidly across the country, prompting the
Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry to issue warnings in Tokyo and 44
prefectures -- all except Aomori and Okinawa prefectures. According to the
National Institute of Infectious Diseases, this winter has already seen the
most serious epidemic since the Institute began monitoring the disease.
On Fri 15 Dec 2006, 4 elderly patients in Matsuyama died after being
hospitalized earlier this month for suspected gastroenteritis. Although the
Institute said the outbreak may already have peaked, they warn that the
public still needs to exercise caution.
Each week, the Institute receives updates from about 300 paediatric medical
institutions nationwide on new outbreaks of the disease. The Ministry
issues a warning to a district's public health centre if 20 or more
patients are found out to be infected during the course of a week at any
paediatric hospital in that district. There are 570 districts nationwide.
The average number of patients suffering from the disease across all
districts stood at a record 19.83 late [in November 2006].
This year's epidemic has spread rapidly eastward after a warning was issued
in the Kyushu region in early October. Earlier this month, the Ministry
issued warnings to 293 public heath centres in Tokyo and 44 prefectures.
Although the spread of norovirus infection is mainly thought of as being
caused by food poisoning, especially through foods such as raw oysters,
there are many cases of people becoming infected from the vomit of others
suffering from the disease.
In one case earlier this month, 347 guests and workers at a hotel in
Ikebukuro, Tokyo, came down with the disease. It is believed others became
infected after vomit from one of the guests was not properly cleaned up.
The vomit was apparently wiped up with paper towels and a neutral
detergent. However, the [infectivity of] noroviruses [is not destroyed by
[neutral] detergent, and treatment with [chloride bleach is advised] In
addition, norovirus can still be spread for up to about 10 days after it
has dried up, and only a tiny amount of the virus is required to make
someone ill.
Schools and facilities for the elderly are particularly prone to outbreaks
of the infection, with norovirus typically spreading through contact with
door knobs and handrails touched by an infected person. For the physically
infirm, the infection can prove fatal. Earlier this month, the Ministry
instructed the metropolitan and prefectural governments to ensure adequate
levels of sanitation at nursing care facilities. "At the current rate of
infection, there could be as many as 10 million people infected," said
Shigeo Matsuno, chief researcher at the institute's Infectious Disease
Surveillance Center.
On 8 Dec 2006, the Centre announced that this this year's outbreak of
infectious gastroenteritis caused mainly by norovirus infection was the
worst in the past 25 years.

This year saw the largest outbreak of infectious gastroenteritis -- mainly
caused by norovirus -- in the past 25 years. An increasing number of
norovirus infections have been reported. The first thing that comes to mind
regarding the source of the norovirus infection is raw oysters or other raw
shellfish with double shells. However, Shigeo Matsuno, a chief researcher
at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, said most of the patients
were not infected that way. "Far more people get the virus from other
infected people than from raw oysters," he said.
According to Akiko Nakamura, a Kyoritsu University of Pharmacy professor
who analyzed cases of food poisoning caused by noroviruses, 44 per cent of
infected people got the virus from oysters in 2001. But in 2004, 45 per
cent of those infected had not eaten oysters, and those who had done so
comprised only 11 per cent of the cases. However, roughly the same number
of cases -- about 270 -- were reported both years. "My guess is that in the
majority of cases, infected people touched food materials with bare hands
while they were cooking, and the people who ate the food were infected,"
Nakamura said.
Many people become infected with the virus through other peoples' waste.
Such cases also occurred at medical facilities, where people are often
infected en masse. As a result, some people at these facilities reportedly
died from the infection.
It is not surprising that the virus spreads this way. Norovirus
[multiplies] prolifically only in the human intestinal tracts. In the sea,
oysters absorb water to eat plankton, also taking in the norovirus that is
carried into the ocean through sewage. The virus is gradually and
completely discharged from the oysters once they are moved into clean water.
Noroviruses is mostly concentrated in the waste of a person infected with
it. About 10 000 to 100 million viral particles can be found per gram of
feces. A tiny amount of feces can spread the virus because as few as 10
particles can cause an infection.
Another problem is that infected people will continue to discharge the
virus for a week, even though their symptoms disappear after a couple of
days. In some cases, the virus remained in feces for more than 3 months.
Unfortunately, the [mechanism of] pathogenicity of the norovirus is still
unknown and experimentation on animals is not possible because the virus
only infects humans. In addition, since people infected with the norovirus
usually recover in a couple of days, the virus has not attracted much
attention. However, the virus' DNA structure has been identified to a
certain degree. It is currently [classified] into genogroup I (GI),
containing 15 genotypes, and genogroup II (GII), containing 18 genotypes.
GII.4 viruses are now sweeping across the globe, including Japan. A major
GII.4 outbreak was reported in Europe in 2002. However, it is not clear
whether the outbreak in Europe is linked to the one in Japan. "It's
possible that the virus entered Japan from Europe and caused an outbreak
here a few years after the one in Europe," said Tomoyuki Tanaka, director
of Sakai City Institute of Public Health. Matsuno said: "There was a major
norovirus outbreak in Japan in 1996, and in light of this, I guess the
virus may cause an outbreak every 10 years or so."
Although few people actually die from the virus, it can affect society when
many people are infected. What we can do to prevent infection is to not
only avoid raw oysters, but pay enough attention to keep things around us
clean. Basic preventive methods are washing your hands after using the
toilet and before cooking, and keeping things clean around patients at home
and in medical and welfare facilities.
