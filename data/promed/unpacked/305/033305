Re: ProMED-mail Rift Valley fever - Saudi Arabia, alert 20090602.2053
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The original article in Saudi Wave, which was so badly translated to
English by Middle East Online, actually attributes the deaths to
dengue fever not Rift Valley fever. Below is the Arabic language
article. I don't know how someone can make that mistake as the names
of the diseases in Arabic have no similarities.

[The URL for the Saudi Wave article for the benefit of those able to
read Arabic text is
<http://www.saudiwave.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1036:q-q-&catid=50:2008-12-02-08-52-24&Itemid=115>.]

[It turns out that the original Saudi Wave URL (in Arabic) has links
to English and French versions of the article. Both refer to dengue
fever rather than Rift Valley fever
