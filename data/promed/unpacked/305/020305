Following the discovery of a case of leptospirosis in a person who descended the Argensou canyon in Ariege [Occitanie], analysis results are awaited. But an order should be issued this Monday [16 Aug 2021] by the mayor of Auzat to prohibit access to the site.

The Haute-Montagne gendarmerie platoon (PGHM) of Ariege is warning canyoning enthusiasts this Sunday [15 Aug 2021]. Indeed, a person who has crossed this canyon contracted leptospirosis, a bacterial disease most frequently transmitted by the urine of rodents, in particular rats. In humans, the disease is often mild but can lead to kidney failure. It is fatal in 5 to 20% of cases.

Another 2 people who have been in the canyon are currently awaiting the results of their analyzes. The mayor of Auzat should issue an order on [Mon 16 Aug 2021] to ban swimming in this area.

For their part, the gendarmes ask summer visitors not to swim temporarily in the Argensou canyon while awaiting the results of the water analyzes which should be carried out.

Auzat is a small village in the Ariege department in the Occitanie region of southwestern France, without access to Spain on its south western border or to Andorra on its southern border, due to the extremely rugged countryside (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari√®ge_(department)). Argensou is a small canyon near Auzat. A description of its tourist activities and a map showing the location of Argensou canyon can be found at https://speleo-canyon-ariege.com/produit/canyon-de-largensou and https://www.adrenactive.com/canyoning-toulouse-canyon-argensou-5785.htm.

Some of the countryside of Ariege is pastoral, with "cows and sheep ... brought to the high mountains [of Ariege] for summer grazing, as are herds of native Merens horses" (https://www.ariege.com/en/discover-ariege/agro-pastoralism). These animals can be carriers of the bacterium _Leptospira_, the cause of leptospirosis, in their urine, which can contaminate streams, where tourists are exposed while engaging in various watersports. A similar outbreak of leptospirosis in tourists engaged in watersports in streams in the Golan Heights occurred in 2018 and was reported by ProMED at the time (see posts listed below).

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is widely distributed throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in the urine of chronically infected animals may survive in freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Mice, as well as rats, can carry _Leptospira_ in their urine and serve as a reservoir for this organism (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6612401).

There are more than 250 serovars of _Leptospira_ species, with multiple serovars being endemic in a given geographic area. Protective immunity against _Leptospira_ infection is predominantly serovar specific. Different leptospiral serovars may be prevalent in particular geographical regions.

Human activities that place people at increased risk of leptospirosis include contact with rats or domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and dogs), walking barefoot in water or mud, swimming in rivers and other watersports, gardening or farming, and working in piggeries (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242886). Some names for leptospirosis are derived from the environmental situations associated with or groups at risk of developing the disease, such as swineherd's disease, rice-field fever, canecutter's fever or disease, swamp fever, and mud fever. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for a rodent infestation.

The diagnosis of leptospirosis requires confirmation by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM dipstick, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used to confirm the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939550/). Dr Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic that of leptospirosis. - Mod.ML
