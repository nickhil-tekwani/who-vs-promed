[Of interest is the fact that 2 "hunting units" and a wildlife range
were involved. Classically, the "classical" version of swine fever in
Europe occurs when infected wild boars make contact with domesticated
swine. However, this report indicates another wrinkle in the
epidemiology of this disease in Russia, since it has appeared in wild
pigs in game reserve-type areas. It is very good that the animal
health authorities in Russia are picking up these cases in unusual
populations. Details of how they found them and how they control the
spread among wild boar populations in these designated wildlife or
hunting units would be most valuable. - Mod.PC]
