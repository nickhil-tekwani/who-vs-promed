Japanese encephalitis toll in Eastern UP mounts to 292
-----------------------------------------------
The deadly vector-borne disease Japanese encephalitis (JE) continued
to claim the lives of children in eastern Uttar Pradesh, with the
toll mounting to 292 following 8 more deaths in the last 48 hours.
State Joint Director Health Dr. Umakant Prasad said 1566 people
suffering from JE had been admitted at the famous Baba Raghav Das
Medical College here and to other hospitals since April 2006. Almost
75 patients -- including 17 fresh cases -- are still under treatment.
The JE patients belong to Gorakhpur, Deoria, Maharajganj, Sant
Kabirnagar, Kushinagar, Basti, Siddharthnagar, Azamgarh, Gonda and
Balrampur districts of UP. At least 194 cases pertain to Bihar, while
Nepal accounts for 8 JE cases reported so far. Of the total JE
deaths, 41 victims hailed from Bihar, Dr. Prasad added. Gorakhpur has
the dubious distinction of being the JE epicenter in the region. The
endemic disease afflicts eastern UP during monsoon season every year.
The state government had undertaken a massive vaccination drive
against the disease; however, the efficacy and effectiveness of the
drive has come under fire with the mounting toll.

[Vaccination of this very large population against JE virus to
achieve adequate coverage in this area of India is a major challenge
logistically and financially. This endemic JE virus situation raises
the very real dilemma of where best to invest time, energy and money
to optimize public health benefits in general for the population. It
would be of interest to know the extent of vaccination coverage prior
to and during the 2006 JE virus transmission season. A map of India
