Japan: Transmission of Hepatitis E Virus from Wild Sika Deer to Humans
--------------------------------------------------
Zoonotic transmission of hepatitis E virus (HEV) has been suggested for
various animals, on the basis of indirect evidence. Shuchin Tei and
colleagues have identified potential zoonotic transmission of HEV from
Japanese Sika deer (_Cervus nippon nippon_).

Over several weeks members of 2 [human] families developed hepatitis
symptoms, but were negative for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses. Physicians
discovered the patients had several times eaten raw meat from deer caught in
the wild in the 7 weeks preceding the first hospital admission. Fortunately,
leftover meat had been frozen and dated at the time of eating. HEV RNA
sequences in the meat of one deer and most of the patients' samples were 100
percent identical. Shuchin Tei and colleagues conclude that this finding is
direct evidence of zoonotic HEV transmission.

However, they believe consumption of substantial amounts of raw deer meat is
necessary for transmission, since eating only a little did not lead to
infection in other family members.

[The Research Letter from Shuchin Tei, Naoto Kitajima, Kazuaki Takahashi, and
Shunji Mishiro is entitled "Zoonotic transmission of hepatitis E virus from
deer to human beings."

Hepatitis E virus is is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus which has
characteristics (morphology and genome organization) in common with members
of the family _Caliciviridae_, but it is sufficiently distinct
phylogenetically to remain classified as a distinct unassigned genus.
Hepatitis E virus has been associated with water-borne outbreaks of illness
and sporadic cases of enterically transmitted acute hepatitis. Hepatitis E
virus is considered to be endemic in tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and
Central America, and non-pathogenic variants may be present globally. On the
basis of immunological studies, related or identical hepatitis E viruses
infect primates, swine, and other animals, to which now can be added Sika
deer. - Mod.CP]

[Japan is a distinctly non-tropical country, so maybe wildlife from temperate
region countries should be examined also. Sika deer are indigenous to Asia,
but have been introduced into zoos & parks in many countries, notably
Madagascar, South Africa, New Zealand & various Pacific island countries, USA
(e.g. KY, MD, TX), UK & 7 other European countries, into which they have
escaped and are breeding in the wild, and also hybridizing with indigenous
deer in England & Texas. It would be interesting to discover whether those
are also harboring hepatitis E virus, and whether their meat is eaten raw in
those countries. - Mod.JW]
