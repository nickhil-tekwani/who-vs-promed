A worker, who was poisoned last week [week of 7 Sep 2015] when he and 26 others were cleaning 2 tunnels of the Tavera-Bao hydroelectric plant in the province of Santiago, died today [17 Sep 2015], bringing to 3, the number of deaths, family and medical sources reported.

The latest victim is a 36-year-old man, according to Efe news agency sources, who added that 2 others are in a state of "coma" and that the worst is expected in these cases.

The man died at a clinic in Santiago where he was from, like most of those affected. The others are hospitalized in different centers of that province, some of them in serious condition.

The 27 workers were infected by a disease transmitted by bats. The provincial health director in Santiago, Eunice de los Santos, said yesterday [16 Sep 2015], that the confirmed diagnosis is histoplasmosis, [a fungal infection transmitted] by bats. These fungi, she said, "are attached to the walls of the tunnel and the contamination is stronger in drought conditions."

The official explained that the severity of each case will depend on the degree of affection and level of immunity.

In principle, the workers were admitted to the municipal hospital in Sabana Iglesia, Santiago, presenting vomiting, nausea, dizziness, headache, pain in the extremities, and other symptoms.

However, due to their serious condition, they were transferred to clinics in the city of Santiago.

[Histoplasmosis is a disease caused by the fungus _Histoplasma capsulatum_ and is distributed worldwide. The fungus lives in soil fertilized by bird or bat droppings. Contaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years. Microconidia spores become airborne when the contaminated soil is disturbed, for example, by digging in contaminated soil. People usually become infected by inhalation of the aerosolized spores, which can travel great distances from the source in currents of air. Most infected individuals remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic illness is primarily caused by an intense exposure and the severity of disease is related to the number of spores inhaled.

Symptoms of histoplasmosis usually include non-specific flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, muscle aches, dry cough, and chest discomfort); potentially fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may occur when larger inocula are inhaled (http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1047573 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7244706?dopt=Abstract). The pulmonary infection can disseminate throughout the body, and immunocompromised individuals may develop a severe form of histoplasmosis called progressive disseminated disease.

Histoplasmosis cannot be transmitted from person to person or from animals to people. The diagnosis can be made by culture of the organism from sputum or tissues, by serology, or by tests for antigen in urine and serum specimens.

The Bao-Tavera Dam Complex refers to 2 earth-filled embankment dams located about 15 km (9.3 mi) south of Santiago in Santiago Province of the Dominican Republic; it provides municipal water, water for irrigation and generates hydroelectric power (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bao-Tavera_Dams).
