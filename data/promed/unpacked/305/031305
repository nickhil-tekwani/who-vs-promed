CWD found west of divide in Wyoming
---------------------------
Chronic wasting disease has been found in 2 mule deer shot by hunters in
the Medicine Bow Mountains and Sierra Madre, marking the first time the
disease has been found west of the Continental Divide in Wyoming.
"This is something we were hoping wouldn't happen, but we're not surprised
it did," said Bob Lanka, wildlife coordinator for the Wyoming Game and Fish
Department's Laramie Region.
One deer was harvested this fall on the western slope of the Sierra Madre
northeast of Baggs. The other was killed on the western slope of the
Medicine Bows south of Saratoga.
About 2000 samples of deer and elk have been dropped off by hunters at
collection centers throughout Carbon and Albany counties, and so far
roughly 600 have been tested, Lanka said.
It is likely other cases will be discovered, he said.
The first known cases west of the Continental Divide were reported in the
spring near Craig, Colo., when 2 deer inadvertently penned inside an elk
ranch were found to be infected. Since then, a few more infected animals
have been found in western Colorado.
Thousands of captive elk were slaughtered this year after a northeastern
Colorado elk ranch with infected animals shipped elk to other ranches.
Chronic wasting disease was also found in Wisconsin this year, the first
time it was documented east of the Mississippi River. It has also been
found in captive or wild animals in Minnesota, New Mexico, Nebraska,
Montana, South Dakota, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Canada.
The disease is in the same family as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or
mad cow disease. Scientists say the strain of misshapen protein, or prion,
that appears to cause wasting disease is different from the one that causes
mad cow disease.
There is no evidence that chronic wasting disease can be transmitted to
cattle or people, although scientists cannot rule it out.
