This season [2009] a farmer had to burn USD 14 300 worth of pumpkin
that he spent months growing on his farm in Seychelles. There was no
other way to stop the disease spreading to his crop. "It was out of
control," he said. "You have to burn it." His neighbour recently had
to burn thousands of dollars worth of Chinese cabbage after they
became infected. "The disease attacks the heart," he said.

Diseases and pests have become a problem for locals who farm the
Anseroyale Plateau on Mahe, Seychelles' main island. Once cool, trade
winds are now warmer, fostering the right breeding grounds for
disease. Changing weather patterns have increased the costs of running
farms making it more difficult to achieve food security, said Antoine
Marie Moustache, Seychelles' Agricultural Agency on Food and Security.

[Pumpkins include a range of species of _Cucurbita_. Chinese cabbage
refers to subspecies of _Brassica rapa_. Both groups of crops can be
affected by many pathogens, which may be favoured by warmer conditions
and could be involved in the problems described above. Reliable
diagnosis of the diseases would be an essential 1st step so management
strategies can be developed to assist these farmers.
