Russia: 11 HFRS Deaths in Republic of Bashkortostan
-----------------------------------------------
Eleven fatal cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS)
have been recorded during the current year [2006] in the Republic of
Bashkortostan. Three cases have been found in the Salavatskiy
district, 2 cases in the city of Ufa, 2 in Kuyurgazinskiy district, 2
in the Mishkinskiy district, and single cases in the Ufimskiy and
Mijakinskiy districts.
In total, 2723 cases of HFRS have been recorded this year [2006] in
the Republic of Bashkortostan, 40 percent more than last year. Half
of all recorded cases of HFRS in Russia are recorded in the Republic
of Bashkortostan. The highest morbidities are recorded in the
Blagoveshchenskiy, Myshinskiy, Tatyshlinskiy and Ufimskiy districts,
where the number of cases is 2.5-fold greater than in the rest of the
Republic.

[During the past 3 months, the number of HFRS fatalities has risen to
6, and the number of cases diagnosed has exceeded 1000. About 2300
cases of HFRS were recorded in the Republic last year (2005), about
400 fewer than this year.
The Republic of Bashkortostan is one of 3 regions in the world
exhibiting high incidences of HFRS, the others being the Primorskiy
region [Krai] of Russia and South Korea. The vector of the HFRS virus
in these regions is a rodent, the red field-vole. An abundance of
deciduous lime woods and benign weather conditions provide a suitable
habitat for the red field-vole.
The total area of the Republic of Bashkortostan is 143 000 sq km (0.8
percent of the total area of Russia), and its capital is Ufa.
Bashkortostan occupies a large part of the Southern Urals. A map of
the Republic can be viewed at
