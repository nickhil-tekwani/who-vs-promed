Highly pathogenic avian influenza reported in Russian bird populations
---------------------------------------------------
The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus type A(H5N1), which
continues to infect humans in Vietnam and Indonesia, has been
reported to have infected bird populations in Russia, according to
the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE, <http://www.oie.int>
[1].
The disease has been reported in 13 villages in the Novosibirsk
region in Siberia, and was first detected on 18 Jul 2005. The virus
is believed to have been transmitted to domestic poultry from wild
waterfowl after contact at open reservoirs.
A total of 18 513 domestic birds have been slaughtered in the 3
affected districts. There are controls on the movement of poultry,
and many other bird populations in the region are being screened.
Affected farms are being disinfected.
In Europe, there has been concern that the highly pathogenic A(H5N1)
virus could be carried in by birds migrating from Russia [2].
Avian influenza in wild birds has also recently been reported in
Mongolia and in domestic poultry in Kazakhstan -- type A and type
A(H5), respectively, further subtyping pending [3,4]. The H5N1 virus
was also detected in Xinjiang province in China in June [5]. This
province borders on Mongolia and Kazakhstan.
Vietnam continues to report cases of human avian influenza. 3 more
human cases of H5N1 infection were confirmed on 5 Aug 2005, bringing
the total since mid-December 2004 to 63 cases, of which 20 have been
fatal [6]. One fatal and one probable human case of H5N1 infection
were reported in Indonesia at the end of July, where H5N1 has
affected domestic poultry since March 2005, and recently, pigs [7].
Between February and May 2005, 4 fatal human cases of H5N1 infection
were also reported in Cambodia [8].
The European Union responded to the reports of circulating A(H5N1)
virus in Russia and Kazakhstan on 8 Aug 2005 by asking member states
to ban the import of feathers and live birds from these countries
with immediate effect. The European Commission Standing Committee on
the Food Chain will review this ban in September [9].
