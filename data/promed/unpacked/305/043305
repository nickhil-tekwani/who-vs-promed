One student (name withheld, has died) was feared dead, while over 30 others were hospitalised from a suspected meningitis that hit Government Girls Secondary School (GGSS) Sokoto.

Confirming the incident, Sokoto State Director of Public Heath, Dr. Abdulrahaman Dantsoho, said they actually got the information, adding that they admitted, treated and discharged 30 students of the school. He, however, said no student died from their records, except the only lady that was reported dead before the issue reached them. According to Abdulrahaman, they have gone to collect samples, including their food, water and every other relevant specimen to ascertain the cause and nature of the ailment.

Sources within the school located within the Mabera axis of the Sokoto metropolis said the ailment might not be far from meningitis, as students showed symptoms related to it. The school's population reportedly increased tremendously by the sudden redeployment of students from security-prone areas to join them.

At the time of filing this report, efforts to confirm other details from the principal of the school proved abortive, as she was said to have directed the security guard to deny people entrance into the school premises.

[We are not given any clinical description of the illness, other than meningitis, that has caused an outbreak in over 30 schoolchildren in Sokoto, Nigeria. More information is required concerning this outbreak in northwest Nigeria.

Sokoto is the capital city of Sokoto State, one of the 36 states of Nigeria, with a population of 427 760 residents, located in the extreme northwest of Nigeria. A map showing the location of Sokoto can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sokoto,+Nigeria.

Northern Nigeria lies within the African meningitis belt, the semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa, where epidemics of meningococcal meningitis recur each year during the hot, dry season between December and June. _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A had been the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in this region (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf). Since the introduction of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt beginning in 2010, however, WHO has noted a decrease in the number of cases of meningitis; in fact, the number of cases in 2013 was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the prior 10 years (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/), and _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A was noted to be no longer the predominant pathogen, having been replaced by other serogroups, notably serogroup C.

As of epi week 9 (1-7 Mar) 2021, the Nigeria CDC reported the following for cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) in Nigeria (https://ncdc.gov.ng/reports/weekly):
- There were 3 suspected cases of cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) reported from 3 local government areas in 2 states (Ebonyi and Katsina). One case was laboratory confirmed and no death was recorded.
- There were 46 suspected and 3 confirmed cases of CSM so far in 2021.

We are not told the microbiological cause of CSM in these cases in this Nigeria CDC report, but it may likely be _Neisseria meningitidis_. - Mod.ML
