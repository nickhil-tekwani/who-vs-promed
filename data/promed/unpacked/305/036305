Comoran health authorities are struggling to contain an epidemic of measles
that has sickened more than 1000 people in the impoverished Indian Ocean
archipelago in the last 2 months, officials said. Hobbled by a lack of
resources, decrepit facilities and a shortage of qualified medical
personnel, compounded by a strike by health workers demanding back pay, the
island nation is seeking help to fight the outbreak, they said.
Some 1040 cases of measles have been reported on the 3 semi-autonomous
islands since Comoros Vice President Caabi Elachroutoui Mohamed declared a
measles epidemic on 31 Jul [2005], 770 [cases] on the island of Anjouan
alone, according to Mohamed Mlidasse, an official with the national
epidemiology center.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF sent experts to the Comoros
earlier this month to look into launching a nationwide vaccination campaign
on Anjouan, Grand Comore and Moheli. The 2 agencies have agreed in
principle to assist in the push, but on Anjouan and Moheli, the
worst-affected islands, the plans have been put on hold due to the
intensity of the outbreak and the strike by physicians on Anjouan,
officials said. The disease has spread to the point on Anjouan and Moheli
"where there is no more point in vaccinating the population," said Chaibou
Bedja, a counselor to the health ministry. "On the other hand, a large
vaccination campaign is being organized to start 12 Sep 2005 on Grand
Comore as long as we get the money we need," he told AFP [Agence France
Presse].
Most of the victims on Anjouan are undergoing remedial treatment at home
due to the unavailability of drugs and empty clinics, said Abou Housseine,
a physician in the capital of Mutsamudu who heads the island's epidemiology
bureau. Comoros, with a total population of about 630 000, had not had any
incidents of measles for more than 20 years until the first new cases were
reported in June 2004 on Anjouan and Moheli. Measles is a highly contagious
disease which continues to kill about one million children worldwide every
year, particularly in developing countries. Half the deaths are in
sub-Saharan Africa, according to the WHO. The airborne viral disease,
associated with high fever, rashes and vomiting, is the worst killer among
illnesses that can be prevented by vaccination.

[Comoros is formed by 3 of the 4 main islands in the Comoros Archipelago,
which is situated in the Indian Ocean, between the African coast and
Madagascar (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoros_Islands> for maps and
description). The Union of the Comoros (until 2002 the Islamic Federal
Republic of the Comoros) is a country in the Indian Ocean, situated at the
northern end of the Mozambique Channel between northern Madagascar and
northern Mozambique. The country consists principally of 3 volcanic
islands: Grande Comore, Moheli and Anjouan, while the nearby island of
Mayotte is claimed by Comoros but declined independence from France, the
former colonial power in the region.
Political turmoil, the neglect of health care services, and geography have
left the Comoros vulnerable to the ravages of a disease successfully
contained by vaccination elsewhere. The situation is reminiscent of the
outbreak of measles in the Faroe Islands observed by Panum in 1846, which
enabled him for the 1st time to deduce the length of the incubation period
of the disease and to establish that those who recovered from the infection
enjoyed life long immunity (see: Katz, M. In: Measles virus. Eds V ter
Meulen and MA Billeter. Springer Verlag, 1995). - Mod.CP]
[ProMED-mail normally does not report measles, which is a
vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. The incidence in the current
outbreak is extraordinarily high: 1651 per 100 000. The experts from WHO
and UNICEF have been sent to the Islands for carrying out nationwide
vaccinations against measles. - Mod.RY]
