[1] Bulgaria, PPR, OIE-WAHID follow-up report No. 2
Date: Tue 17 Jul 2018
Source: OIE WAHID, PPR Bulgaria follow-up report No. 2 [summ., edited]
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=27251


Date of start of the event: Sat 23 Jun 2018
Date of confirmation of the event: Sat 23 Jun 2018
Report date: Tue 17 Jul 2018
Type of report: follow-up report No. 2

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 4 in the province Jambol (Yambol), municipality Bolyarovo. Of the 4, 2 sheep holdings are located in the village of Sharkovo, and one each in villages Strandzha and Krainovo. In 2 of the 4 holdings, a small number of goats were kept as well.

Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Goats / 19 / 0 / 0 / 3 / 0
Sheep / 1035 / 15 / 0 / 1035 / 0

Epidemiological comments:
The outbreaks were confirmed through the surveillance carried out in the 10 km [6.2 mi] surveillance zone established around the 1st outbreak of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) in Voden village, Yambol region. The diagnosis was confirmed in a laboratory; no clinical signs were observed during the time of sampling. Testing was carried out by the EU reference laboratory CIRAD, France. Total stamping out in the affected herds, as well as preventive culling of all small ruminants reared in the village (considered as animals in contact), was carried out.

[As indicated in the epidemiological comments above, the 4 new outbreaks have been identified by serological tests while no clinical signs were observed. This does not preclude the possibility that mild clinical disease in some animals might have been missed prior to the sampling date.

OIE's summary of the 6 outbreaks recorded since the start of the event (Sat 23 Jun 2018) in Bulgaria's southern provinces Burgas and Jambol bordering Turkey, including a map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=27029. - Mod.AS]

Disease report
--------------
The Bulgarian authorities have reported a case of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) in sheep in the Yambol, Bulgaria, region, on the border with the Thrace region of Turkey. In a flock of 540 sheep and goats, 2 animals tested positive and one died, with disease confirmed by the European Union Reference Laboratory. This is the 1st occurrence of PPR in Bulgaria and in the EU.

According to the disease report, the sheep and goats were co-grazing with 3 other flocks in an area where there are many small holdings. Disease control measures are in place, including protection and surveillance zones and culling all in-contact small ruminants.

Situation assessment
--------------------
PPR is a serious (non-zoonotic) viral disease of sheep and goats causing production loss and mortality of more than 50 per cent in affected flocks in nonendemic regions. PPR is the current focus for global disease eradication, following the success with the related morbillivirus, rinderpest. Vaccination with live attenuated vaccines is available for prevention and control of disease, although there is no approved DIVA vaccine available in the EU. Instead, as an exotic notifiable disease, control in the EU is based on eradication, according to European legislation directive 92/119/EEC.

There are 4 lineages of PPR virus strains. Lineages I and II are found in West Africa; lineage III in East Africa, the Middle East, and South India; and lineage IV in Asia. However, lineage IV viruses were detected in Morocco in 2008 and even in sub-Saharan Africa.

PPR is transmitted most commonly via direct or aerosol contact with infected animals, although fomites and contaminated products cannot be ruled out. The virus is secreted in all secretions or excretions of infected animals. The disease has been reported in Turkey on a regular basis, but no recent cases have been officially reported from the Thrace region, which borders Bulgaria and Greece. The source of disease therefore remains unknown.

The role of wildlife is not fully understood, but feral sheep and goats may be important in terms of the epidemiology in the region. Generally, sheep show fewer clinical signs than goats, and in regions of higher sheep density, disease can spread undetected. Therefore, prompt detection, culling, movement restrictions, and disinfection should be applied to prevent spread.

If wildlife or illegal animal movements are the source of infection, it would be of interest to know which lineage is involved and whether PPR is present in the Thrace region or if there has been movement from the Anatolian region of Turkey, which would be of concern, given the presence of sheep pox, lumpy skin disease, and importantly, foot-and-mouth disease in that region (see map "Outbreaks of exotic notifiable diseases of livestock in Turkey, January 2018-June 2018, on page 1 of the assessment document at the source URL).

According to the EU trade notification system, there have been no consignments of live sheep or goats or the semen or embryos of such species from Bulgaria to the UK. OIE recommendations for safe trade are that, regardless of the PPR status of the premises, skins and hides from animals should be treated or semi-processed, while meat should originate from animals showing no clinical signs of PPR within 24 hours of slaughter, and milk should either come from flocks not under disease restriction or be processed.

Conclusion
----------
The risk of PPR introduction to the UK as a result of this outbreak is considered negligible, as there are no data to suggest any pathways for transmission are fulfilled.

We will continue to monitor the situation, as this is an important exotic disease that will be a concern for the EU in terms of its ability to spread and the impact on livestock.
