A dengue outbreak has occurred in the Bolivian Amazon region, with numerous
individuals infected, according to information revealed in a report issued
by the Ministry of Public Health. This bad epidemic has spread in Beni and
Pando departments [state or province equivalents], with 450 and 100 cases
respectively, including 4 patients with confirmed DHF.

Government [units] at diverse levels have mobilized the local inhabitants
to take preventive measures against the current dengue outbreak, which has
been caused by torrential rains and floods which have battered the region.

[On 14 Nov 2008, ProMED-mail posted a report (archive no. 20081118.3636)
showing that there were 17 dengue cases in Cobija, the capital city of
Pando department. The above report indicates that there have now been 100
cases in that department, and an additional 450 cases in neighboring Beni
department.

Brazilian authorities say deaths from dengue fever in Rio de Janeiro nearly
quadrupled last year [2008] to 106. Government news service Agencia Brasil
says a city Health Secretariat report also notes 87 more deaths under
investigation that could be linked to dengue.

Agencia Brasil says 127 000 people in the city were sickened [by dengue]
last year [2008], up from 25 000 in 2007. It did not report a possible
cause, and Secretariat officials could not be reached Sunday [11 Jan 2009].

Dengue killed 27 people in 2007 in Rio, which is one of the Brazilian
cities most affected by the mosquitoborne [virus] disease. Dengue [virus
infection] causes high fever, severe headaches, and joint pain. Most cases
are not fatal, but the more virulent, deadly strain has been reported more
frequently.

[One hopes that there will not be a renewed dengue outbreak in Brazil, and
especially in Rio, as severe as that of 2008. ProMED-PORT posted a similar
report in Portuguese from ComuniWeb dated 10 Jan 2009
<http://www.comuniweb.com.br/?idpaginas=20&idmaterias=390883>, indicating
that there were 330 dengue cases in December 2008, raising concern that the
dengue outbreak might revive with the onset of warmer weather.

As of yesterday [11 Jan 2009] in Asuncion, Paraguay, there was just one
case of dengue, but meanwhile there are 10 suspected cases at the moment.
In respect to dengue, the Minister of Public Health, Esperanza Martinez,
assured the public that the degree of public work being carried out to
combat the breeding sites of _Aedes aegypti_, the mosquito vector [of
dengue virus], will prevent dengue this year [2009] from reaching the
alarming levels it has in previous years, including when it has caused
epidemics.

In communication with Radio Nanduti, the Secretariat of State explained
that the drought occurring now will halt expansion of mosquito breeding
sites [assuming that the populace has not increased water storage in their
houses, which would provide _Aedes_ breeding sites - Mod.TY].

He indicated, also, that the [number] of [dengue] cases that might occur
are within the range expected by health authorities. "We do not have an
alarming situation such as we have had in previous years," the official
indicated. Martinez indicated that the [dengue] program of his job focuses
as a priority on the period up to March, the month in which summer ends and
high temperatures accompanied by rains begin to slowly ease.

We are intensifying the dengue program so that citizens will constantly do
surveillance and be aware that mosquito control is a responsibility of
citizens and families, stated the public health head. He explained that
health workers do random controls neighborhood by neighborhood, and in
those neighborhoods where there is a high rate of [_Aedes_] infestation,
measures will be intensified. Also, there will be active searches for
febrile cases. He also insisted that citizens report suspected [dengue]
cases to the closest health centers. He recalled that in 2008, 1200
laboratory tests yielded 16 confirmed [dengue] cases.

[4] Australia (Queensland)

Dengue sickened more than 100 people in north eastern Australia, marking
the worst outbreak of the potentially lethal mosquitoborne disease since
2004. In Cairns, Queensland state, 97 people were ill, while 350 km (218
miles) south in Townsville, an unrelated outbreak of a different strain of
the virus struck 6 people, said Brian Montgomery, a senior medical
entomologist with Queensland Health. More than 10 people have been
hospitalized, though none has died, he said. An outbreak in 2003 and 2004
struck almost 900 people, killing one.

Health officials are concerned the 2 outbreaks may merge, raising the risk
that the epidemic will turn deadly. While people infected with one type of
dengue develop lifelong immunity to that virus, studies have shown
subsequent infection with a different strain makes a person more
susceptible to a complication called dengue hemorrhagic fever, which can kill.

The Cairns outbreak of type 3 of the [dengue] virus began after a resident
infected in Kalimantan, Indonesia returned to the city, Montgomery said.
Townsville's [dengue virus] type-1 outbreak has been traced to Singapore,
he said. Hot, humid weather and rainfall in the region has helped the
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito species, which spreads dengue [virus], to breed
more than normally for this time of year, Montgomery said.

"We still have ideal weather patterns at the moment for prolific _Aedes
aegypti_ breeding, and we have dengue in more areas of Cairns than we can
respond to comprehensively," he said. "We're bracing ourselves for an
outbreak which could persist to April or May [2009]."

Health workers have laid more than 2000 traps in homes around Cairns and
local authorities are issuing fines of AUD 375 (USD 264) to households that
fail to clear mosquito-breeding sites from their yards, Montgomery said.

Symptoms include high fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, vomiting and
rashes. Usually, people with dengue recover within 2 weeks, according to
the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH). The infection can be
fatal when it turns into dengue hemorrhagic fever, which causes bleeding
from the nose, gums or under the skin, or dengue shock syndrome, which
causes massive bleeding and shock, according to NIH. There are no drugs or
vaccine for the disease.

[The number of dengue cases in Cairns has increased from 52 as of 24 Dec
2008 (archive no. 20090105.0041) to over 100 reported above. Reducing
_Aedes aegypti_ breeding sites quickly is a challenge, since it relies
heavily on community participation, in this case reinforced by fines for
households that do not comply. This will doubtless not be the last
importation of dengue virus into Queensland. In a report kindly sent to
ProMED-mail by Dr Thomas Coombs that appeared in Cairns.com (byline: Damon
Guppy) <http://www.cairns.com.au/article/2008/12/30/21495_local-news.html>,
Tropical Health Population Services' senior director Brad McCulloch said
many dengue virus-infected people arrive at Cairns airport but that the
current outbreak was fueled by perfect conditions for the virus vector to
thrive, a mixture of steady rain, heat and humidity. "We get about a dozen
dengue imports each year," he said.

Dengue vaccines are currently undergoing clinical trials in Thailand. Also,
The Australian of Sydney, Australia, in its 9 Jan 2009 edition
<http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24891127-23289,00.html>,
reported that University of Queensland researchers have successfully
infected the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito with a bacterium which halves the
insect's life span, reducing the opportunity for the virus to reach the
mosquito's salivary glands and be transmitted.
