Public health officials in North Carolina (NC), South Carolina (SC),
Tennessee (TN), and Georgia (GA) are investigating an incident in
which players at a South Carolina softball tournament may have been
exposed to a rabid kitten.
Public health officials are contacting girls who played in the South
Atlantic Summer Showdown Tournament on 14 Jul 2007, in Spartanburg
County, SC. On that date, a coach at the tournament found the gray
kitten in a barrel-style dumpster, which was located behind the
dugout at the Boiling Springs Recreational Facility. The kitten was
placed in a box and taken later that day to games at the North
Spartanburg Recreational Facility.
The coach took the kitten home to Buncombe County on 14 Jul 2007. It
sickened and was put down on 15 Jul 2007. The cat tested positive for
rabies at the North Carolina State Public Health Laboratory.
Experts cautioned that only people at those 2 venues on 14 Jul 2007
had any potential exposure to the kitten. They also stressed that
just petting the kitten doesn't mean that a person was exposed to rabies.
Rabies is spread through the bite of an infected animal or through
direct contact of animal saliva with open cuts in the skin, mouth, or
eyes, according to North Carolina State Public Health Veterinarian,
Dr. Carl Williams.
Public health authorities are working with tournament organizers to
identify and contact people who may have been exposed to the animal.
Girls and their families will be contacted and asked if they were
bitten by the kitten or if the kitten's saliva had contact with open
skin cuts or with their eyes or mouths.
Public health authorities would also like to find the person who left
the kitten in the dumpster at the Boiling Springs Recreational
Facility, because they may also have been exposed to rabies. Anyone
who knows anything about the disposal of the kitten in the dumpster
should contact South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental
Control's Region 2 Environmental Health Office at (864) 282-4144.

[Animals can become exposed to and infected with rabies at very young
ages. Many public health authorities also track the people that may
have been scratched by the suspect animal as well.
A discussion of rabies virus may be found in ProMED-mail posting 20070426.1364.
Post-exposure rabies prophylaxis (PEP) for unvaccinated persons
should always include administration of both human rabies immune
globulin (HRIG) and a series of 5 rabies vaccinations. The
combination of immune globulin and vaccine is recommended for both
bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the time elapsed since the
exposure. Previously immunized persons should receive only vaccine.
Human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) provides rapid passive immune
protection. It is given only once, on the 1st day of the
post-exposure prophylaxis regimen (designated day 0). As much as
possible of the HRIG should be infiltrated into and around the wound,
and the remaining given intramuscularly at a site distant from the
vaccination site (frequently the gluteals [buttocks]). If the HRIG
was not administered on day 0, it may be administered through the 7th
day of the regimen. Beyond the 7th day, HRIG is not indicated since
an antibody response to vaccine is presumed to have occurred. The
recommended dosage of HRIG is 20 IU/kg body weight, for all ages. No
more than the recommended dosage of HRIG should be given.
Rabies vaccine induces an active immune response that requires 7 to
10 days to develop and persists for 2 years or longer. The PEP
vaccine series consists of 5 1-ml doses of rabies vaccine given on
days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. The injection must be given intramuscularly
in the deltoid [shoulder] region of adults or in the anterolateral
thigh of young children. The 1st dose of rabies vaccine should be
administered in conjunction with HRIG on day 0 of the PEP regimen,
except in previously vaccinated individuals. Previously vaccinated
persons are given 2 1.0 ml doses of vaccine IM, on days 0 and 3 (no
HRIG is administered).
In the USA there are 2 inactivated cell culture rabies vaccines
currently available: human diploid cell vaccine (HDVC) and purified
chick embryo cell vaccine (PCEC). Both are considered equally safe
and efficacious. It is recommended that a vaccine series be initiated
and completed with the same vaccine product.
In general, there is a very low frequency of serious adverse
reactions to the rabies PEP regimen. Local pain and low-grade fever
may follow administration of HRIG. Pain, erythema, swelling, itching,
and other mild local reactions are reported among 30 percent to 74
percent of vaccines. Headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches,
dizziness, or other systemic reactions are reported among 5 percent
to 40 percent of vaccines. Rabies PEP should not be interrupted or
discontinued because of local or mild systemic adverse reactions to
rabies vaccine. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antipyretic
agents may be used to control mild adverse reactions.
An immune-complex-like reaction (generalized urticaria, sometimes
accompanied by arthralgia, arthritis, angioedema, nausea, vomiting,
fever, and malaise) occurs in approximately 6 percent of
pre-exposure-vaccinated individuals receiving a booster dose. This
reaction can rarely occur in persons receiving their primary
vaccination regimen; however it has not been reported to be life
threatening in either case.
When a person with a history of serious hypersensitivity to rabies
vaccine must be revaccinated, antihistamines may be administered
concomitant with vaccine, and the person should be observed for
development of anaphylaxis immediately following vaccination. The
Acute Disease Investigation and Control Section of CDC (US Centers
for Disease Control & Prevention) is available for consultation about
the management of possible rabies exposure and PEP in patients with a
history of serious adverse reactions to rabies vaccine.
