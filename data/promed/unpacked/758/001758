On Wednesday [28 Nov 2007], Caretaker Minister for Livestock Mir
Hanif Khan Jakhrani ordered an inquiry into the reported poisoning of
buffaloes in Cattle Colony. The minister visited the affected area
and talked to the dairy farmers to learn more details of the issue.

The Director General of Fisheries and Livestock had been assigned the
job to conduct the inquiry. "After receiving the report, I will take
action against the responsible and also take measures to compensate
the affected dairy farmers," Jakhrani said.

Minister Jakhrani also issued instructions for round-the-clock
support of the buffalo treatment program by the veterinary doctors.

"It is a job of district government, but keeping in mind the national
loss, I have asked doctors to provide treatment to these buffaloes at
the expense of the Sindh government. We are also providing medicines,
he added.

[Comment by Dr. Ligda: With the success of the FAO Global Rinderpest
Eradication Program (GREP), Pakistan was declared provisionally free
of rinderpest in 2003. The last cases were identified at Karachi in
October 2000.

The mention in a previous post of a lack of adequate laboratory
facilities is troubling. Hopefully, Minister Jakharrani's oversight
will include verification and validation of the necessary laboratory
identifications. Clinical signs in the water buffalo can vary greatly
from the classic.

A minor point of clarification might also be appropriate to clarify
the record. The buffaloes involved are probably _Bubalus bubalus_,
the Asian water buffalo rather than _Syncerus caffer_, the African
buffalo].

[Dr. Ligda is likely correct that it is more likely the Asian
buffalo. Thank you for correcting that.
