Over 100 deer are suspected dead in Crawford County, and about 7 were confirmed dead, as of 26 Sep 2019, from a sporadic virus transmitted by biting flies, also referred to as midges, according to Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources [DNR] officials. Local hunters and the DNR believe this is by no means the final count either.

Hemorrhagic disease (HD) is an infectious, often fatal, condition affecting white-tailed deer, caused by either bluetongue virus (BTV) or epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) virus, which are both indistinguishable in external appearance and only identified in laboratory testing.

From within 7 to 10 days of contracting EHD, these deer are dying of internal hemorrhaging and high fevers, often near water because they want to cool off or drink. EHD signs also include excessive and sometimes bloody salivation, a rosy or bluish tongue in some cases, and loss of wariness, according to Bret Owsley, DNR Wildlife Management District Supervisor.

"When we're finding dead deer next to a water source or getting reports of people being able to walk right up next to the deer and pet them, and we know [EHD] is in the county; we may not need to sample them," Owsley stated, explaining these cases are then considered probable. "We also may not be able to sample them because, for our protocol, we need to get to the carcass within 48 hours." This is to ensure the sample is fresh and doesn't result in a false negative.

Crawford and Vernon county wildlife biologist Dan Goltz urges the public to still report 1st-hand observation of abnormal single or group deer deaths to the DNR.

"We want people to call us so we can have an accurate handle on geographic distribution and make more informed decisions about what EHD looks like in Wisconsin," Goltz said.

It's a non-discriminatory disease, so it can afflict any age, bucks and does. He said they may otherwise look like healthy deer, with very little outward indications of the disease.

"EHD can take deer in all seasons. It's more evident now because people are out prepping for deer hunting, harvest season is starting, and weeds are down," added Brian Sauer, Iowa DNR private lands wildlife conservationist. He noted that northeast Iowa battled the disease 3 or 4 years ago around the Sny Magill Creek area in Clayton County, though, this year [2019], only 2 cases so far have been suspected in the county.

"Crawford is having the most reports at this point," said Nancy Businga, a microbiologist in the Wisconsin diagnostic lab that is testing lung tissue samples for the viruses. "But Richland and La Crosse counties have had a couple, and Sauk has at least one confirmed."

She emphasized that EHD virus poses no risk to humans. DNR literature on this condition states that "humans are not at risk when handling infected deer, eating venison from infected deer, or being bitten by infected midges."

"If the deer appeared sick in any other way, we obviously wouldn't recommend eating the deer," Businga said.

Landowners and hunters are advised that deer carcasses can be left on the landscape to decompose as the virus does not survive. The DNR doesn't plan to collect or remove deer suspected of having died from EHD.

The DNR claims some deer have survived EHD. In those recovering, ridged hoof growths may be noticeable. The short-lived disease is said to cease once the midges die with the 1st hard frost.

Goltz gave assurances that the state of Wisconsin, and even Crawford County, shouldn't expect EHD to impact its deer population as a whole. However, he said, landowners with acreage who have found 20 dead deer, for example, may "most certainly" see a localized effect.

Deer hunters who personally responded to a Courier Press Facebook post about the outbreak have mostly represented the Kickapoo Valley.

Troy Martin said he observed a couple along Rhein Hollow Road in Wauzeka Township.

"It's a shame," he said.

Jeff Clausen reported at least 30 dead from EHD on a 1500-acre property in the town of Haney.

Others said a property in Steuben has found 12 to 15 affected, while another hunting group along Taylor Ridge in Barnum has witnessed about 20.

Randy Mara hunts with his brothers and friends on an 800-acre parcel near Plum Creek Road in rural Wauzeka. He affirmed on 26 Sep 2019 that 30 dead deer have been found on the property since about a month ago, and all were within about 30 yards of water. He said a couple were confirmed by the DNR to have EHD.

"It seems like they decay a lot faster with this than any normal deer," Mara commented. "I found one on Thursday, and it had a couple flies on it. When I came by again Tuesday, it was nearly all bones already. And you don't see a vulture, eagle or a crow near them."

He shared that he was able to walk right up to a few infected deer. "It was like they were staring into space. They don't know anything, but they're real docile."

In the fall of 2012, the DNR recorded significant numbers of deer found dead in 8 southern Wisconsin counties, many of which tested positive for EHD. Then, Goltz said, no real repercussions were seen among the general deer population. Since that year, Wisconsin saw one confirmed case with no additional or suspect cases in 2017.

The DNR 1st diagnosed EHD in Wisconsin deer in the fall of 2002, when about 14 were found suddenly dead in Iowa County. That year's outbreak was suspected of killing around 380 deer, and most deaths were reported in Columbia and Dane counties. Between 2002 and 2011, samples from deer were collected and tested, and results didn't show exposure to the viruses that cause HD, which suggested HD isn't common in the state.

"It's typically very strongly related to drought conditions," Sauer said. "The midge hatches, and it spreads fairly fast." Owsley said this year [2019] seems to be counteracting the theory, as the weather has been wet and cooler.

He's afraid very little can be done to prevent or stop the spread of EHD, although the DNR will continue monitoring it in order to get a hold on herd management strategies.

In the meantime, Clausen said his group is going to be "super selective" about the deer it harvests this fall [2019]. He said their trail cameras have seen much less activity since this outbreak started.

As for Mara and his crew, they plan to go "buck only" this hunting season.

He concluded simply: "It's really unfortunate."

[Hemorrhagic disease (HD), caused by viruses in either the epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) group or bluetongue virus (BTV) group (Reoviridae: _Orbivirus_), is the most important viral disease affecting white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) and mule deer (_O. hemionus_) in the United States. In North America there are 3 subtypes of EHD virus (EHDV 1, 2, and 6) and 5 subtypes of BT virus (BTV 2, 10, 11, 13, and 17). Isolated cases BT viruses from infected deer were first reported in 1968, although white tail deer mortalities consistent with EHD/BT disease were noted as early as 1886.

EHDV and BTV is transmitted between its ruminant hosts by species of _Culicoides_ biting midges. Available data suggest that the species of _Culicoides_ that transmit EHDV are likely to be similar though not necessarily the same as for BTV.

The mode of transmission of EHD in nature is via a _Culicoides_ biting fly or midge. _Culicoides variipennis_ is the most commonly incriminated vector in North America. A deer must be bitten by a midge carrying the virus to become infected. The disease is not transmitted directly from one deer to another but must go through the insect vector. A common observation in outbreaks involving large numbers of deer is that they are single epizootics which do not recur. Die-offs involving small numbers of deer occur almost annually, and the disease appears to be enzootic in these areas. All documented outbreaks of EHD have occurred during late summer and early fall (August-October) and have ceased within 2 weeks of the onset of frost, which kills the midge.

Experimentally, the disease can be transmitted to susceptible deer by the inoculation of virus-laden material from infected deer by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or oral routes.

Clinical signs: Clinical signs of EHD and bluetongue are very similar, although molecularly they are not the same disease.

White-tailed deer develop signs of illness about 7 days after exposure. A constant characteristic of the disease is its sudden onset. Deer initially lose their appetite and fear of humans, grow progressively weaker, often salivate excessively, develop a rapid pulse and respiration rate, and fever (affected animals frequent bodies of water to lie in to reduce their body temperature) Eight to 36 hours following the onset of observable signs, deer pass into a shock-like state, become prostrate and die.

Pathology: The gross and histological lesions of EHD have been characterized by, as its name implies, extensive hemorrhage. The hemorrhages range from pinpoint to massive in size, and involve different tissues and organs in individual animals. No organs appear to be exempt from hemorrhage, with the most regularly involved being the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, lung and intestinal tract. Extensive hemorrhaging is the result of interference with the blood-clotting mechanism together with degeneration of blood vessel walls.

Generalized edema and increased pericardial fluid are consistently found in EHD. These changes also reflect the widespread interference with normal blood circulation.

The virus can be recovered from a variety of tissues of animals which have succumbed to EHD. These include blood, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, heart and muscle.

Diagnosis: A combination of case history, characteristic signs and lesions, and the isolation of the virus is necessary for a diagnosis of EHD. Useful aids in obtaining a diagnosis are the epizootic nature of the disease, its seasonal occurrence, its spectacular hemorrhagic lesions and the extensive edema. Because of the similarity of its symptoms to other diseases, such as bluetongue and malignant catarrhal fever, the isolation and identification of the virus is essential.

Methods to be used for virus isolation are inoculation of cell cultures, inoculation of susceptible sheep or deer combined with serologic monitoring, and intravenous inoculation of embryonating chicken eggs.

Treatment and control: There is no known effective treatment or control of EHD. Theoretically, an oral vaccine could be developed for administration through a supplementary winter feeding program, but this is presently impossible, impractical and unwarranted.

Significance: Because of its very high mortality rate, EHD can have a significant effect upon the deer population in a given area, reducing numbers drastically. A common observation in outbreaks involving large numbers of deer is that they are single epizootics which do not recur. Die-offs involving small numbers of deer occur almost annually, and the disease appears to be enzootic in these areas.

Hemorrhagic disease can be transmitted to other wild ruminants. The EHD virus can infect domestic animals, most commonly hoof stock, but rarely causes disease.

The edibility of the venison is not impacted by the disease. There is no evidence that humans can contract the EHD virus either from the midge or from handling and eating venison.

Pets and wildlife cannot be infected either by midges or from EHD-infected deer carcasses.
