Researchers Fear That Hepatitis C Epidemic Looms - Washington Post
(03/25/97) P. A1; Brown, David: Researchers and public health experts say
that a hidden hepatitis C epidemic will emerge as the next big infectious
disease problem in the United States, but not until the next century. An
estimated 4 million Americans, or 1.8 percent of the population, have
contracted hepatitis C over the past 30 years. The liver infection, usually
chronic and incurable, is four times more common than HIV. The virus that
causes the infection was not identified until 1989, and many questions about
the disease remain unanswered. A three-day "consensus conference" is being
held at the National Institutes of Health this week to discuss the most
recent research and the best way to treat the disease. The virus is
transmitted easily through blood and less frequently through sexual contact.
About 20 percent of hepatitis C carriers are expected to develop liver
problems sometime in their lives.

"Experts Warn of a Tripling of Deaths From Hepatitis C by 2017" New York
Times (03/27/97) P. A19:
A panel of experts, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, said on
Wednesday that the annual American death rate from hepatitis C will triple
to 24,000 by the year 2017. The panel added that while the rate of new
hepatitis C virus infections has dropped, to about 30,000 cases each year,
current treatments for the disease are not effective for most patients,
curing only about 20 percent of those with chronic disease. The FDA,
meanwhile, extended approval on Wednesday to use Intron, a hepatitis C drug,
for up to two years. The FDA decision was unrelated to the announcement.
