We report the 1st human case of melioidosis detected in South Africa. A 36-year-old man in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal province, presented with dizziness, nausea, weakness, coughing, and inability to walk. He was admitted to a hospital on 9 Jul 2018. He was HIV positive with a CD4 count of 18. His condition deteriorated and despite intensive medical care, he died on 20 Jul 2018. The pathogen was identified from blood culture by the local National Health Laboratory Service microbiology laboratory and confirmed at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, by MALDI-TOF and electron microscopy. Subsequent whole genome sequencing indicated a new sequence type.

Melioidosis is a disease of animals and humans caused by the environmental bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_. Infected animals (horses, pigs, sheep, goats, and rodents) may spread it to new areas, where it persists in water and soil. Barefoot farming in wet conditions, flooding, and travel in endemic areas are some exposure risk factors. Typical predisposing medical conditions are diabetes, renal or liver disease, malignancy and immunosuppression. Human-to-human transmission does not occur. Clinical presentation includes pneumonia, cutaneous or visceral abscesses, and septicaemia, and case fatality is high (40-75 percent), despite antimicrobial therapy. Prolonged incubation periods (days to years) can make it difficult to identify the source of exposure.

Melioidosis is endemic in tropical or subtropical regions of Australia, Western Pacific, Asia, Indian Ocean islands, and South and Central America. Sporadic cases have occurred in West and East Africa, but there is no sound epidemiological data about the burden or distribution of disease in Africa. The only previous case of melioidosis reported in South Africa was that of a goat, in 1995.

The predicted environmental suitability for _B. pseudomallei_ in South Africa is low, and is more favourable in parts of the neighboring countries of Botswana and Mozambique. However, as this case and the previous animal case suggest, improved local awareness of melioidosis is needed.

Although a classical infection in eastern Asia and Northern Australia, cases have been acquired in Africa, Central and South America, and the Caribbean basin. Reference 2 above is a 2016 paper (Limmathurotsakul D, Golding N, Dance DA, et al. Predicted global distribution of _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ and burden of melioidosis. Nat Microbiol. 2016;1:15008. doi: 10.1038/nmicrobiol.2015.8; abstract available at https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol20158) that estimates -- for 2015 -- the burden of melioidosis for the areas of major and some risk as follows:

Area / Population at risk in millions / Melioidosis cases in thousands / Melioidosis deaths in thousands
South Asia / 1525 / 73 / 42
East Asia and Pacific / 858 / 65 / 31
Sub-Saharan Africa / 602 / 24 / 15
Latin America and Caribbean / 246 / 2 / 1
Middle East and North Africa / 49 / less than 1 / less than 1

Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is a herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease.

Melioidosis may present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright, red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80 to 95 percent. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40 to 50 percent.

The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials. It should be noted that bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy; and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism.

The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate.

For the microbiologists among our readers, a new (and 5th) member of the _B. pseudomallei_ complex has been described, _B. humptydooensis_, from the Northern Territory of Australia and named after the small town of Humpty Doo near to where the isolate was found (Tuanyok A, Mayo M, Scholz H, et al. _Burkholderia humptydooensis_ sp nov, a new species related to _Burkholderia thailandensis_ and the 5th member of the _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ complex.
