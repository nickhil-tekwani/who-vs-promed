Bluetongue virus serotype 14 detected in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
During November 2012, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have informed the European Commission on the detection of a significant number of animals, mostly cattle, serologically positive to bluetongue virus. In the 3 countries, the samples were taken in the framework of the bluetongue surveillance. Serologically positive samples were analyzed by RT-PCR and found negative in all cases except in Lithuania where 15 animals showed an equivocal result.

Poland has reported that, similarly within the framework of the bluetongue surveillance, 3 cattle farms have been found to include positive animals both serologically as well by RT-PCR. Furthermore, sequencing was performed leading to the identification of a virus highly compatible with BTV serotype 14. Positive farms are located on the border with Belarus and Lithuania.

All 4 countries have implemented the following measures: animal movement restrictions in the positive farms and epidemiological investigations in the area around them.

All positive samples have been sent to the Community Reference Laboratory (Pirbright) for confirmation and virus sequencing.

It has been recommended to the Veterinary Services of the Autonomous Communities [Spain's administrative regions] to exercise vigilance in relation to animals susceptible to bluetongue which have been imported from the mentioned countries.

[According to the above information, from a Spanish web-site, BTV-14 is suspected in Poland and 3 Baltic countries. Subscribers are referred to an earlier information from Russian sources about an imported calf, suspected in Spain as BTV-14 infected. - Mod.AS]

Bluetongue disease can halt Estonian cattle export
--------------------------------------------------
Based on lab studies in Estonia, the Estonian Veterinary and Food Board suspects a beef cattle animal in the Saaremaa island to suffer from bluetongue disease which can cut the export of Estonian cattle considerably if confirmed, LETA/Saarte Haal reports.

"This can turn out to be a very serious setback for Estonian animal farmers," said head of the Animal Breeders Association of Estonia Tanel Bulitko, adding that confirmation of the bluetongue disease will mean export restrictions for Estonia's export to third states, including Turkey and Russia. The prices offered by the Turkish have raised the price of Estonia sheep considerably for other buyers too.

The results of the repeat test conducted in UK should arrive at the end of this week, said Veterinary and Food Board director general Ago Partel, adding that the bluetongue disease has never been diagnosed in Estonia before.

Bluetongue disease or catarrhal fever is a non-infectious insect-borne, viral disease of ruminants, mainly sheep and less frequently cattle. It is caused by the Bluetongue virus (BTV). The virus is transmitted by the midge Culicoides imicola and other culicoids. In sheep, BTV causes an acute disease with high morbidity and mortality.

[Results from the BT reference laboratory (IAH, Pirbright, UK) are anticipated. In particular, it will be interesting to obtain genotyping results and confirmation -- or otherwise -- of earlier assumption that the virus might be of vaccine origin (Russian press release 20121126.1424954).

Until an official confirmation is obtained or results from the reference laboratory become available, the described cases, in 4 countries, are regarded as 'suspected.' - Mod.AS
