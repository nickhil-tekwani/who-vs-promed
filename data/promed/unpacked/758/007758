Wisconsin Records First Human Rabies Case in 41 Years
------------------------------------------------
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
MADISON: 28 Nov 2000 -- State health officials confirmed Wisconsin has
recorded its first human rabies cases since 1959.
A Sauk County resident who had been hospitalized at the Reedsburg Area
Medical Center and St. Mary's Hospital in Madison died on 1 Nov 2000. Test
results performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
in Atlanta confirmed the patient was infected with the rabies virus,
specifically with the silver-haired bat/Eastern Pipistrelle strain of
rabies virus.
Rabies is a viral disease producing a fatal inflammation of the brain,
called an encephalitis. Nearly all cases of human rabies are acquired from
the bite of a rabid animal. Signs and symptoms of rabies include headache,
agitation, delirium, difficulty swallowing, hallucinations, seizures,
paralysis, and coma. Virtually all patients die within a few weeks after
the onset of illness. The disease is preventable if an exposed person is
treated after a known exposure has occurred.
"The public health response to this occurrence is now focused on
determining whether any contacts of the patient sustained a potential
exposure to rabies from the patient," said James Kazmierczak, an
epidemiologist with the [Wisconsin State Division of Public
Health. "Although there has never been a confirmed instance of
person-to-person transmission of rabies, such spread is theoretically
possible."
Acquaintances of the patient are being evaluated by the Sauk County Health
Department, and health care workers who came into contact with the patient
are being assessed by hospital staff.
Health officials stress any risk of rabies incurred through contact with a
rabid individual would be extremely low. This risk would only be of
concern if infectious secretions from a patient (saliva and tears) came
into contact with another person's mucous membranes such as those of the
eyes, mouth, or nose, or into contact with an open wound.
This is the fifth reported case of human rabies occurring in the USA during
the year 2000. The 4 previous cases occurred in California, Georgia, New
York, and Minnesota. The majority of human rabies cases acquired during
the past several years in the United States have been associated with
exposure to bats.
Rabid bats have been documented in 49 of 50 states, Hawaii being the
exception. While rabies occurring in bats is widespread, it is not a
frequent occurrence. Since 1995 in Wisconsin, 32 (3 percent) of 1005 bats
submitted to the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene have tested positive
for rabies. The 32 rabid bats were submitted from 23 Wisconsin counties.
Recent data suggest transmission of rabies virus can occur from minor or
unrecognized bites from bats. The limited injury inflicted by a bat bite
and an often inaccurate recall of the exact exposure might limit the
ability of health care providers to determine the risk of rabies resulting
from an encounter with the bat.
The preventive treatment for rabies consists of a one-time injection of a
drug called human rabies immune globulin, which contains antibodies against
the rabies virus. In addition, the patient receives a series of 5 doses of
rabies vaccine, which are injected into the arm muscle over the course of
28 days.
In Wisconsin, skunks and bats are the most likely animal species to carry
the rabies virus, although dogs, cats, raccoons, foxes, and livestock have
also been infected during the past several years. Public health officials
suggest the following precautions to minimize the spread of rabies: Keep
pet dogs, cats, and ferrets vaccinated against rabies; Avoid contact with
all wild animals, especially those acting abnormally; Teach children a
healthy respect for unfamiliar dogs, cats, and wild mammals; Do not keep
exotic or wild animals as pets, regardless of how young or cute they are;
Exclude bats from living quarters by keeping screens in good repair and by
closing up any small openings that could allow them to enter; If an animal
bite does occur, wash the wound immediately with plenty of soap and water
and contact a health care provider and your local health department.
[From the contributor: One note on a slight inaccuracy in the report. One
rabid bat has been found in Hawaii; however, it was not indigenous. It was
a big brown bat (_Eptesicus fuscus_) found in a container having been
off-loaded from a ship in Honolulu in 1991. The incident is described in:
Sasaki DM, Middleton CR, Sawa TR, Christensen CC, and Kobayashi GY, 1992,
Rabid bat diagnosed in Hawaii. Hawaii Med J 1992 Jul;51(7):181-5
