Russia: Outbreak of Hepatitis in the Autonomous Republic of
Karachaevo-Cherkessia
-----------------------------------------------
180 people were [diagnosed] with hepatitis, including 142 children. The
first cases were registered in December 2003 in the village of
Zelenchukskaya in the Autonomous Republic of Karachaevo-Cherkessia. Later
hepatitis cases [were diagnosed] in other parts of Karachayevo Cherkessiya.
According to the Sanitary Epidemiological Surveillance Center, the cause of
the outbreak [was the unhygienic] condition of drinking water sources in
the aforementioned populated areas. The situation was worsened because of
interruptions in the public electricity supply, which affected the water
supply system and contributed to contamination by flood water.
To limit the outbreak and prevent further spread of hepatitis, vaccination
of children and food production staff has begun. In Zelenchukskaya a
drinking water pipeline is under reconstruction.

[The water-borne nature of this outbreak indicates that hepatitis A virus
is the etiologic agent. Neglect of the public water-supply and drainage
infrastructure has been a recurrent feature of recent reports of hepatitis
outbreaks in remote parts of Russia and its Autonomous Republics.
Preventative vaccination is a short-term solution. - Mod.CP]
