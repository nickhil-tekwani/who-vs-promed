[1] Case update
- Sun 16 Sep 2018. Epidemiological situation report, DRC Ministry of Health
[in French, machine trans., edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=84ac48a712

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 15 Sep 2018:
- A total of 142 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, 111 confirmed and 31 probable.
- Of the 111 confirmed, 66 died and 38 are cured.
- 4 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 2 new confirmed cases including 1 in Beni and 1 in Butembo.
- 2 confirmed case deaths in Beni.
- 1 new person healed in Mabalako.

News of the response
Surveillance
------------
- A joint investigation team was sent to the Komanda health zone, north of Beni city [North Kivu], after an Ebola confirmed case died at the Ebola treatment center in Beni. The purpose of the mission is to identify contacts and define vaccination belts.
- To date, 4 038 431 travelers have been checked at the various entry points set up.

Vaccination
-----------
- Immunization activities continue in the 48 vaccination belts spread over the 7 affected health zones. A data consolidation and harmonization process is underway. We will resume publishing immunization data as soon as this process is completed.

[An impressive number of travelers have been checked at the borders, representing what must be a major effort at entry points. It would be interesting to know how many individuals were actually stopped at the border for suspicion of infection. We only have the denominator of number tested, 4 038 431. This would be one measure of effectiveness of the checks. But lack of international spread of the virus is the ultimate measure, and by that gauge, the effort has been successful. - Mod.LK]

- Sun 16 Sep 2018. Congo's Ebola outbreak death toll nears 100; containment 'difficult'
[New Straits Times, Agence France-Presse (AFP report) edited]
https://www.nst.com.my/world/2018/09/411465/congos-ebola-outbreak-death-toll-nears-100-containment-difficult

Efforts to rein in an Ebola outbreak raging in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo are being complicated by the geographical spread and growing suspicion towards outsiders fighting the epidemic, the Red Cross said [Fri 14 Sep 2018].

Since the outbreak of the deadly virus was declared on 1 Aug 2018 in the eastern North Kivu province, 137 confirmed or probable cases have been registered reports [as of 15 Sep 2018, MoH reports 142 cases -- see [1] above], including 92 deaths, according to DRC health authorities.

Kinshasa last week said the outbreak was "under control", with the speed of transmission slowing significantly since mid-August 2018.

But while the number of cases and deaths are not currently surging, Red Cross's disaster chief warned that the growing geographical spread of cases, as well as increasing community resistance was deeply worrying.

"This has not been contained geographically. That is a huge challenge," Pascale Meige told AFP in a telephone interview after a visit to the affected areas.

The epicentre of the outbreak remains in Mabalako and Beni in North Kivu, but 6 other areas in that province have also been affected, as well as one in neighbouring Ituri province, according to the World Health Organisation.

The recent spread of Ebola to Butembo in North Kivu, an important commercial hub of one million people, is particularly concerning since it is close to Goma, a large city that borders Rwanda. "The risks are really high in terms of further spread," Meige said.

She also warned that rumours were spreading in affected communities that were harming efforts to halt the outbreak, she said, including that Ebola was a hoax aimed to enrich foreign health workers, or a political ploy connected with looming DRC elections.

"The level of mistrust is extremely high," said Meige, who heads disaster and crisis response and recovery at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

She hailed the "extremely sophisticated response" so far by the DRC health ministry, the WHO and others, but warned that each time a case appears in a new place, those efforts must be duplicated.

The response includes peppering affected areas with hand-washing stations, campaigns to get the sick to quickly seek treatment, and tireless efforts to track and vaccinate anyone who has been in contact with Ebola patients, as well as their contacts.

IFRC stands for a vital part of the response by ensuring the highly contagious bodies of people who die from Ebola are buried in a safe and dignified manner.

"The systems are in place, and are very impressive," Meige said.

But she said the growing geographic spread meant it was becoming increasingly difficult to nip harmful rumours in the bud, or to address significant community resistance to allowing strangers in hazmat suits to orchestrate burials.

There had been "a number of incidents" where IFRC teams were attacked with rocks and chased away, she said. In one case in Butembo, the family of the deceased had agreed to allow an IFRC team to bury their loved one, only to have the wider community revolt. People pulled the body out of the casket, Meige said, adding that fortunately in that case it turned out that Ebola was not the cause of death.

As of [Thu 13 Sep 2018], IFRC teams had conducted 126 "safe and dignified burials" in cases where people were confirmed or suspected of having died from Ebola.

But Meige said there were 22 cases where the organisation's teams had not been able to conduct burials, due mainly to community resistance or lacking access over security concerns.

"Initially there was this concept of small pockets of resistance here and there," she said. "Now what we see is ... that it is a much bigger problem. The mistrust is spreading."

[The resistance in the communities is serious and hampers control efforts. But it is hoped that the innovative approaches the DRC is coming up with to counteract the mistrust in the population, involving ministry and community leaders, as well as adapting entertainment to teach the population about Ebola, among other things, will have some success. However, as the virus spreads geographically, these measures must be applied in each new locale, a further challenge. - Mod.LK]

[2] Ituri: media reports of suspect cases as yet unconfirmed
- Sat 15 Sep 2018. 2 suspect cases
[Radio Okapi, in French, machine trans., extracted, edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2018/09/15/actualite/sante/ituri-une-personne-presentant-des-symptomes-debola-est-morte-mahagi

Two suspect cases, including one fatal case were reported in Mokambo in the Mahagi territory [Ituri province]; and in Gety, in the territory of Irumu (Ituri), says provincial interim governor, Pacifique Keta.

Samples were taken and sent to Beni for analysis and results are pending.

[Results will be reported once they are announced. It should be kept in mind that other hemorrhagic diseases present clinically similar to Ebola, such as, Marburg virus disease, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Lassa fever. In addition, early symptoms of Ebola look very much like other diseases common in Africa, particularly malaria and dengue fever. We hear little about the suspect cases that have not been diagnosed positively as Ebola, that is, what etiologic agent was determined to be the cause of illness/death. These patients are clearly very sick. Early in the outbreak, samples may not have been taken from patients following death to diagnose Ebola or other etiologic agents, but at this point one would imagine specimens must be available for diagnosis. - Mod.LK
