The New Jersey Department of Agriculture (NJDA) has quarantined 2 farms -- one in Gladstone and one in Pompton Plains -- after tests confirmed a horse from the Gladstone farm contracted the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). That horse is receiving treatment and recovering at a veterinary quarantine facility in Oldwick.

State Veterinarian Manoel Tamassia, DVM, MS, PhD, Dipl. ACT, said the horse had attended a horse show in Newburgh, New York, the weekend of 12 Jan 2013. On 18 Jan 2013, a veterinarian informed the NJDA that they were treating a horse for an illness involving neurologic signs. The initial positive test result for EHV-1 was confirmed by the New Jersey Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory that day, and a trace of the horse's movements was undertaken with the assistance of the New York State Veterinarian's office. Pennsylvania and Connecticut authorities also are involved in the disease investigation. Tracing activities revealed 11 additional horses from New Jersey also participating in the show were exposed to the positive horse. All have been located and none are currently showing signs of illness.

"The department has taken immediate preventive measures to stop the virus from spreading," said New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Douglas H Fisher. "It is essential that we use quarantines and trace back in equine herpes cases since the disease is easily transmitted, causing many horses to become sick or die."

The EHV-1 virus spreads quickly from horse to horse; has a high morbidity rate; and can cause a wide range of clinical signs, ranging from a complete lack of clinical signs to respiratory problems, especially in young horses, and spontaneous abortions in pregnant mares. The neurologic form of EHV-1 can cause an acute paralytic syndrome, which results in a high mortality. The incubation period of EHV-1 is typically 2 to 10 days. The virus spreads readily through direct contact with infected materials. While highly infectious, the virus does not persist well in the environment and is neutralized by hand soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizers. The virus does not affect humans and other domestic animals, with the exception of llamas and alpacas.

Concerned owners should consult with their veterinarian prior to taking any action, as the clinical signs of infection with the neurological form of EHV-1 are common to many other diseases. The neurologic form of EHV is a reportable disease in New Jersey. If an owner has a horse that is exhibiting neurologic signs or suspect their animal could have EHV-1, they are directed to call their veterinarian immediately.

A horse farm in Pompton Plains has been quarantined after a horse from a Somerset County farm tested positive for neurologic equine herpes. The New Jersey Department of Agriculture quarantined the Gladstone farm where a horse contracted the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus, type 1 (EHV-1), according to a news release. The horse is recovering and receiving treatment at a veterinary quarantine facility in Oldwick.

State Veterinarian Dr Manoel Tamassia said the horse had attended a horse show in Newburgh, NY the weekend of 12 Jan 2013. On 18 Jan 2013, a veterinarian informed the Department that they were treating a horse for an illness involving neurologic signs.

[The disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2-10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
