Response to Army Surgeon General Ronald Blanck's posting:
[Dr Nass has written a detailed critique, covering the issues listed below.
As it is very long, it had been archived as:

Please note that ProMED-mail is interested in the issue of the
effectiveness and safety of anthrax vaccine. We do NOT wish to get into a
discussion of Gulf War Syndrome, since there is no firm evidence that it is
communicable, or emerging - Mod.JW

A. EFFICACY
B. SAFETY
C. HYPOTHESIS
D. CONCLUSIONS

1. The efficacy of MDPH-PA anthrax vaccine in the setting of biological
warfare is uncertain at best.

2. The safety of anthrax vaccine, either used alone or administered with
experimental adjuvants, is uncertain because of significant questions to do
with the ways it was administered and the subsequent development of Gulf
War illnesses in some vaccinees.

3. It is now 1998, more than seven years since the end of the Gulf War,
and we still lack an acceptable case definition or definitions for Gulf War
illnesses...
4. ... It is hoped that General Blanck will consider the information
presented here, and include vaccine-related causes within the purview of
Gulf War illness investigations. The anthrax vaccinations should be halted
until it is known precisely what the troops have received and are
receiving, and until the side effect profile has been clarified. (April
20, 1998)
