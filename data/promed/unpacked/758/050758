2nd ring rot outbreak under investigation
-----------------------------------------
A further UK outbreak of potato bacterial ring rot is being investigated, Fera [Food and Environment Research Agency] has announced. The suspected outbreak in the east of England follows notification by the Dutch Plant Protection Service of the delivery of two varieties of seed potatoes from a farm affected by ring rot in the Netherlands. They have been used to grow seed and ware potatoes in England.

The Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate (PHSI) has been tracing and testing remaining harvested stocks and provisional results suggest ring rot in one of the varieties. Final confirmation will take several weeks and tests on the other variety are continuing.

Tracing of stocks of other varieties grown on the farm, which grew seed potatoes from the Dutch stocks is under way, as well as tracing of ware potatoes grown from the Dutch stocks. There is no evidence any of the infected stock has moved outside of England.

NFU's [National Farmers Union] Tim Papworth said: "The high level of imports over the past few months have increased the risk of introducing and spreading harmful organisms. New legislation to strengthen plant health protection which will reduce the risks in the future."

[Earlier this season], an outbreak of ring rot in Wales in ware potatoes imported from Poland was reported [see ProMED-mail post 20121213.1448960].

[Ring rot of potato is caused by the bacterium _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_. Yield losses of up to 50 percent have been reported. Many solanaceous species, including tomato and aubergine, are also susceptible, and the pathogen has also been found associated with symptomless infections of sugar beet and sugar beet seed.

Symptoms on potato may include wilting and yellowing of leaves, rot of the vascular ring of tubers with emerging bacterial ooze, and extensive tuber rot followed by internal hollowing, cracking, and mummification. Wilting symptoms may occur late in the season and are often masked by the natural senescence of the crop. Symptom expression depends on host cultivar and is favoured by cool climates. Tubers with ring rot are often subjected to secondary invasion by other bacteria and fungi, which can result in total loss of tubers in the field or in storage.

The pathogen is spread with infected seed tubers or other plant material, plant-to-plant contact, soil, and by mechanical means (for example during harvest or grading). The bacteria can survive for several years on dry surfaces and for over a month in water. They can overwinter in unharvested potatoes or crop debris. Ring rot can pass through one or more crop generations without causing symptoms, and latently infected tubers are an important means of spreading the disease. Laboratory tests are needed to detect latent infections. Illegal farm saved seed potatoes are known to pose a serious risk for the spread of ring rot. Disease management is expensive and may include cultural practices and plant hygiene measures before and after harvest, but the use of certified clean seed potatoes is vital.

Ring rot found in southern Netherlands since 2009 resulted in extensive testing of seed consignments and alerts to other European growers (ProMED-mail post 20111229.3697). However, infected lots seem to have been exported to, at least, Germany (ProMED-mail post 20120503.1121126) and UK.
