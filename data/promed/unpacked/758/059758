Sydney Water managing director Chris Pollett has advised all Sydneysiders
to boil their tap water before drinking it following the discovery of the
parasites _Giardia_ and _Cryptosporidium_ in the city's main water systems.
The source of the contamination was located between the upper canals of the
Nepean Dams and the Prospect Water Filtration Plant. They were identified
in water outlets running between both supply plants.
Mr. Pollett has said that continuing tests will take place until an
all-clear can be given. The Prospect Plant and its downstream pipes are now
being treated to clear the _Giardia_ and _Cryptosporidium_ organisms. An
intensive audit of the plant and its treatment and monitoring systems is
now underway. The results will be released publicly and sent to the
independent inquiry announced by the Premier Bob Carr.
State Urban Affairs and Planning Minister Craig Knowles was quoted as
telling ABC Radio today that "I'm told ... that the search of the 23km of
that open canal has identified a number of dead animals in there, a number
of dogs. Now how they've got in there, goodness only knows, but they've
either fallen in or been thrown in by uncaring owners ... The inquiry we
announced yesterday needs to look very thoroughly at all these issues, so I
don't really want to pre-empt the outcome of that, but suffice to say, as
the Premier said yesterday that we are going through this very, very
carefully and very seriously. This is a major health issue for Sydney and
one that can't be downplayed and won't be downplayed ... and where there
are demonstrations of either negligence or incompetence, we will pursue
those very vigorously indeed."
The New South Wales Health Minister Andrew Refshaugewhas told Parliament
that routine water testing for the parasite _Cryptosporidium_ was
inappropriate, adding, "The 1996 Australian Drinking Water Guidelines state
that 'routine monitoring for _Cryptosporidium_ is not appropriate'."

[I have never thought that dead animals per se had anything to do with
_Giardia_ or _Cryptosporidium_. All they demonstrate, to me, is that there
is ready access of any (faecal) material to this water. From another source
there was an account of heavy rain possibly contributing to the problem.
Blame-placing never solved any problems or accelerated finding true causes.
