Health authorities have confirmed bird flu in a chicken and in the feces of migratory birds. Cases of avian influenza [AI] reported so far all involved ducks. The latest case involving a chicken was reported at a farm in Buyeo, a town about 150 km from where the poultry disease was 1st detected at a duck farm in North Jeolla Province a week ago.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said it has found that the infected chicken contains the H5N8 strain of the virus. It marked the 1st time that the H5N8 strain has been found in a chicken.

Later on Saturday [25 Jan 2014], officials in the populous Gyeonggi Province, a region surrounding Seoul, said feces recovered from around Sihwa Lake in Hwaseong, on the province's west coast just south of Seoul, also contained AI. They said they could conclude by as early as Sunday [26 Jan 2014] whether the strain is the highly pathogenic strain.

The province has designated the area within a 10-km radius of the lake as a quarantine zone, restricting entries of poultry and vehicles, officials said.

The confirmation from the poultry farm in Buyeo is expected to expand the scope of precautionary culling to cover chickens [see items 2, 3]. Only ducks had been slaughtered as a preventive step after the highly pathogenic strain of bird flu was found among a group of migratory birds found dead on 17 Jan 2014 at a reservoir near affected farms in North Jeolla Province. Authorities believe they may have been the carriers of the virus.

The government is considering imposing a lockdown at all poultry farms throughout the country as avian influenza is showing signs of further spreading, officials said on Sunday [26 Jan 2014].

A nationwide lockdown, if issued, will prohibit the movement of any poultry, workers, or vehicles from farms for 48 hours. Such a move can be extended once for another 48 hours.

Such a move will create what health authorities here have called a "window of opportunity" to sterilize all poultry farms at the same time and thus prevent a further spread of the disease.

The consideration for such a move apparently comes as the animal disease is fast spreading to surrounding areas from Gochang in North Jeolla Province, where the 1st outbreak of AI was confirmed on 17 Jan 2014. The government had imposed a 48-hour lockdown at all poultry farms in Gochang soon after the 1st outbreak of AI was confirmed.

The number of confirmed AI cases has since reached 18 with the highly pathogenic H5N8 strain of the virus confirmed in the latest case at a chicken farm in Buyeo, South Chungcheong Province on Saturday [25 Jan 2014].

A new suspected case was reported earlier in the day at a duck farm in Cheonnan, located only some 80 km south of Seoul, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said in a press release. Tests were underway in an additional 21 suspected cases as of Sunday [26 Jan 2014].

Some 470 000 birds, mostly ducks, have been slaughtered so far. Over 1.74 million others are set to be culled as the government has decided to also destroy chickens at all farms within 3 km from affected farms after it confirmed the 1st outbreak of bird flu in chickens on Saturday [25 Jan 2014].

An outbreak of avian influenza is showing signs of spreading along the west coast with 6 farms in South Jeolla and Gyeonggi provinces and South Chungcheong reporting suspected cases over the weekend [25-26 Jan 2014].

Poultry on 4 farms are being tested, and, if the cases are confirmed, up to 1.4 million chickens will have to be destroyed.

One of the suspected cases was reported on a chicken farm in Buyeo, South Chungcheong Province. Chickens are more vulnerable than ducks. Considering chickens outnumber ducks 5 to 1, poultry farms raising the former could be devastated.

The agriculture ministry announced Sunday [26 Jan 2014] that chickens and ducks on all poultry farms within 3 km of the 6 farms would be culled to prevent the disease from spreading.

With the government realizing the severity of the outbreak, Prime Minister Jung Hong-won held an emergency ministerial meeting on Sunday [26 Jan 2014] to discuss relevant measures.

"Cases of bird flu have been observed along the route of migratory birds, so we will focus our quarantine efforts in these regions in order to prevent the contagion spreading to nearby poultry farms," Jung said.

"We will also strengthen publicity activities to discourage people from visiting these areas during the Lunar New Year holiday."

The outbreak seemed to have entered a dormant phase until Saturday [25 Jan 2014] morning, as no outbreak had been reported in North Jeolla Province for 4 days in a row [see commentary].

However, on Saturday and Sunday [25-26 Jan 2014], 6 more suspected cases were reported; while the H5N8 strain of avian influenza was found in feces of migratory birds in Lake Sihwa in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province.

The 1st outbreak over the weekend came at the chicken farm in Buyeo. The quarantine authority confirmed dead chickens were infected with H5N8.

The outbreak at the farm prompted the government's decision to cull all ducks and chickens within 3 km of the 6 farms. Some 488 000 birds on 35 farms have been culled so far, and 1.75 million birds at 42 [farms] could be additionally destroyed.

"The decision is based on the livestock quarantine committee's opinion that a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak in chickens spreads fast among poultry, and preventive culls are needed to avoid additional sporadic flare-ups," the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said in a statement.

In the 2nd case of an outbreak at a duck farm in Haenam, South Jeolla Province, the authority confirmed the H5N8 virus as responsible.

Inspections at 4 other farms -- in Buan, North Jeolla Province, Naju and Yeongam in South Jeolla Province and Cheonan in South Chungcheong Province -- are ongoing.

In the meantime, 49 different suspected cases of bird flu in migratory birds have been, or are, being examined. The test results on 13 were positive, while those on 7 were negative.

The migratory birds infected with the virus were found at the Dongrim Reservoir in Gochang, North Jeolla Province; the mouth of the Geum River; and Lake Sihwa in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province.

Despite multiple suspected cases of avian influenza, the government decided to keep its warning state at the "alert" level. The ministry judged that the disease is occurring "sporadically" rather than being "transmitted horizontally," because the newly reported cases aren't related to existing ones.

"The necessity to raise the level to serious is low, but we will continue to monitor the situation and decide," the ministry said.

In the meantime, the bird flu outbreak in Haenam, South Jeolla Province, posed serious concerns to the poultry industry over a possible shortage of duck meat. Some 8 million ducks -- more than 40 percent of the country's supply -- are raised in South Jeolla Province.

Fear of the spread of the disease is heightening as the Lunar New Year holiday begins on Thursday [30 Jan 2014]. More than half of the population is expected to travel from their residences to visit relatives.

[A pause of 3 or 4 days between HPAI outbreaks without a new focus discovered on farms does not seem to justify implying "dormancy."

The extremely severe control measures contemplated by South Korea's animal and public health authorities could be explained by the unusual, unfortunate combination of 3 factors that they are facing:
1. HPAI H5N8 in wild birds (seemingly, large scale);
2. HPAI H5N8 outbreaks on duck and now also chicken farms;
3. The timing of the Lunar New Year festivities, characterised by increased consumption/sales/slaughter of poultry and mass population movements (travels).

It is hoped that infections by the circulating virus strains remain restricted to avians.
