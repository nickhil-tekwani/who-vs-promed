The slaughter of 62,000 pigs at a farm in the northeastern German state of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern started Saturday after swine fever was diagnosed
there. The slaughter, estimated to cost 15 million marks (8.4 million US
dollars), was ordered Friday by agriculture authorities. In addition the
farm in Losten had sold pigs for breeding to farms in the German states of
Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia where
authorities ordered the slaughter of all 20,000 pigs from the Losten farm.
European Union farm expert Christina Kaul in an interview with the
Westfalenblatt newspaper said Germany faced a pork export ban unless the
German authorities managed to get the epidemic under control by Wednesday
when the E.U. veterinary committee will discuss the issue. In a bid to
prevent a spread of the epidemic to neighbouring Belgium authorities there
have imposed a strict quarantine on all animals in more than 90 Belgian pig
breeding farms which had recently imported animals from Germany.
