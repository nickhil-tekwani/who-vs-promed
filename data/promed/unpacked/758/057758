The May 17,1999 posting by Stephen Berger entitled 'Hantavirus Pulmonary
Syndrome-Canada background' contains some inaccuracies. Following is an
update on the current hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) situation in
Canada and a correction to some comments contained in the May 17 posting:
As of May 25,1999, 31 cases of HPS have been reported in Canada. All cases
have been reported from Canada's three most western provinces (British
Columbia - 6 cases, Alberta - 20 cases, Saskatchewan - 5 cases). The
earliest known case of HPS, identified retrospectively, occurred in Alberta
in 1989. Persons diagnosed with HPS have been 15 years or older (mean 40
years); 17 (39%) have been female, and 11 (36%) have died. Most of the
cases were likely exposed to rodent excreta contaminated with Sin Nombre
virus during farming and domestic activities in rural areas.
Despite the substantial local media attention at the time, the putative
1997 case of HPS in the province of Ontario to which Dr. Berger refers in
his posting is NOT considered to be a case. The clinical presentation and
history of potential exposures were not entirely compatible with HPS. After
extensive testing in our laboratory and Dr Hjelle's laboratory in New
Mexico, a diagnosis of HPS was not confirmed. A notice to this effect was
distributed to all Medical Officers of Health in Ontario.
The hantavirus species/strains and their distribution in Canada as listed
by Dr. Berger contains some errors. New York virus has never been clearly
documented in Canada and Nova Scotia is one of only two Canadian
provinces/territories in which we have never demonstrated hantaviruses in
deer mice. To date, hantavirus infected deer mice have been found in
Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan,
Alberta, British Columbia and the Yukon Territory. Genotyping analysis on
representative strains from these provinces and the Yukon have indicated
that all hantaviruses infecting deer mice in eastern Canada
(Newfoundland,New Brunswick,Quebec and Ontario) appear to be most closely
related to Monongahela and New York viruses, whereas all hantaviruses
found west of Ontario (including the areas where all 31 Canadian cases have
occurred) are most closely related to a different genogroup that includes
Sin Nombre and Convict Creek [a strain of Sin Nombre virus - Mod.CC
viruses.
In addition to the above deer mouse-associated hantaviruses, a Prospect
Hill-like virus (or viruses) has been demonstrated in meadow voles in
Ontario and Manitoba.

[We are grateful to Mike, Harvey and Denise for this correction.
ProMED-mail had another message of correction of this matter but we were
hoping someone from Canada would provide a correction. Now done. Keep in
mind that input to GIDEON is based on many reports, some few of which are,
inevitably, incorrect. - Mod.CC
