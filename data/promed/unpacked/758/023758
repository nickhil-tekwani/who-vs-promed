[Since ASF was 1st reported by China in August 2018, the disease has now affected 14 provinces, including the event recently reported in Chongking province.

All outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) reported from 1 Jan 2018 to date (5 Nov 2018) can be seen on the interactive map at https://tinyurl.com/y9uavhpy (click on the section of interest on the map and zoom in).

"ASF virus is highly stable and temperature resistant and can persist in the environment for a long time.(...)

"Due to the absence of an effective vaccine, introduction and spread of ASF onto domestic pig farms can only be prevented by strict compliance with biosecurity measures.

"Main mechanism of spread:
- Direct pig-to-pig contact, including contact with wild pigs
- Movement of infected live animals
- Contaminated vehicles and other fomites, clothing, footwear, any other equipment
- Workers and visitors
- Consumption of contaminated feed (swill feeding)
- Contact with infected animal products
- Improper disposal of manure and dead animals
- Slurry
- Genetic materials
- Ticks"
