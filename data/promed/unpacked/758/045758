Little cherry disease on the rise
---------------------------------
Little cherry disease is threatening the Washington cherry industry. The virus, which results in small, bitter-tasting cherries that are unmarketable, took a big jump in 2013, Tim Smith, WSU [Washington State University] said. "I'm not sure everyone recognizes how serious it is. We need to jump on it now and get ahead of it before it takes out the industry."

There is no cure and the only treatment is tree removal. Last [2013] fall, 200 acres [81 ha] of cherry trees were yanked out. "I would guess another 200 to 400 [81-162 ha] acres need to come out in the Wenatchee area," Smith said.

The virus is difficult to detect because it's only visible at harvest. The tree looks fine, but cherries on part of a tree aren't ripe, he said. They finally turn red, but never taste good and are always small. Growers need to mark those trees and check them out, he said. The disease spreads rapidly. Fumigating the ground after tree removal doesn't help so it's best to let ground lie fallow for a year and watch trees that are left, he said.

In 1933, the virus all but wiped out the British Columbia cherry industry. It's been detected in Washington since the 1930s but has never been a serious problem. Wet, cool springs, Smith believes, contributed to an uptick. In 2010, he confirmed the disease in 10 out of 10 orchards he suspected. In 2011, it was 8 out of 8, and in 2012, it was 3 out of 6. "In 2013, we had many suspected orchards. Too many for me to count," he said. "Almost all were tested and confirmed."

[Little cherry disease (LCD) is a serious problem for sweet and sour cherry producers in parts of northern Europe and North America. It can be caused by 2 closteroviruses, _Little cherry virus 1_ (LChV-1, not yet assigned to a genus) and LChV-2 (genus _Ampelovirus_), in single or mixed infections. Both viruses are present in North America, but the current outbreak in Washington appears to be associated with LChV-2 (see link below).

Symptoms vary with host cultivars, but may include reduced size and quality of fruit, premature leaf reddening, stunting of seedlings, and some loss of tree vigour. All commercial cherry cultivars are susceptible, and ornamental flowering cherries can be asymptomatic reservoirs of LChV-1.

LChV-2 is transmitted by one or several species of mealybug vectors which can be spread by wind and with packing material in their nymph stages. An insect vector for LChV-1 is not known. Both viruses can be spread by both shoot and root grafting and with infected plant material. Disease management for LCD includes use of certified clean planting stock and budwood, elimination of inoculum (removal of infected trees, as mentioned above), and vector control for LChV-2.
