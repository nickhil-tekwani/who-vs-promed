Outbreak of drug resistant tuberculosis in London
-------------------------------------------------
The same strain of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ has been identified in 49
cases of isoniazid resistant tuberculosis (TB) in London, United Kingdom,
using IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism typing (1,2). The
first case dated from 1995, and subsequent cases were diagnosed in 1998(2),
1999 (15), 2000 (25) and 2001 (6 to date). The rate of TB notifications in
London rose from 29.1 per 100 000 in 1995 to 40.3/100 000 in 2000.
14 of the 49 cases are linked with a London prison. 7 cases probably, and
one possibly, acquired TB infection within the prison. The periods of
incarceration of the 7 cases with probable transmission in prison
overlapped with the time that other cases in prison were likely to have
been infectious. There was no known contact between these 7 cases and the
other cases without prison links, and in none of these cases had TB been
diagnosed before.
The first prison case was an inmate during the 3 months before he was
diagnosed with smear positive pulmonary TB in January 2000. For the 5 cases
diagnosed as a result of symptomatic disease, the period that they stayed
in prison overlapped with the time that this first case was likely to be
infectious. Between 2 and 9 months (mean 5.2 months) elapsed from the last
exposure to the infectious case and the onset of symptoms in the subsequent
cases.
One of the 2 other cases probably infected in prison was diagnosed by
tracing prison contacts of the 5 symptomatic prison cases, and the other
was diagnosed during investigation of unrelated symptoms.
This is the first documented outbreak of TB in a prison in the United
Kingdom. Comprehensive arrangements were in place in the prison for
investigation and referral of cases of TB before the outbreak. The outbreak
has led to further strengthening of TB control and prevention measures
including screening new prisoners for symptoms, direct supervision of the
administration of all doses of treatment, designation and training of a
lead TB nurse, and occupational health screening.
