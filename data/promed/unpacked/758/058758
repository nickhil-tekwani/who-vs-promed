Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 111
---------------------------------
Weekly update
-------------
As of 25 July 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas
territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of
pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18 398 deaths. WHO is
actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent
consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and
through monitoring of multiple sources of information.

Situation update
----------------
Worldwide, overall pandemic and seasonal influenza activity remains
low. In the southern hemisphere (where the winter season is in
progress), current influenza activity remains variable: ranging from
low and stable activity in Chile and Argentina, to low but increasing
activity in Australia and New Zealand, to elevated and recently peaked
activity in South Africa. Significant seasonal and pandemic influenza
virus transmission continues to be detected at variable levels across
parts of the tropics, particularly in several countries of the
Americas and South and Southeast Asia
-------------------------------------
In the southern hemisphere, overall influenza virus transmission
remains low to sporadic, except in South Africa, where recent
wintertime influenza activity appears to have peaked, and in Australia
and New Zealand, where influenza activity remains low but continues to
increase steadily, particularly in recent weeks. In South Africa,
virologic data from outpatient sentinel surveillance suggest that the
current period of influenza activity (primarily attributable to
circulating seasonal influenza H3N2 and B viruses) began and rose
sharply during early June 2010, with a likely peak and decline in
activity occurring since the 1st week of July 2010.

Data on the full extent of severe illness associated with recent
influenza activity are not yet available, however, early reports
suggest the current influenza season has been generally mild in terms
of levels of clinical disease in the population. In Australia, overall
rates of ILI [influenza-like illness] remain low and have increased
only slightly over the past 4 weeks (through the 2nd week of July
2010); however, of note, the number of viral respiratory disease
presentations to the emergency departments in Western Australia
increased more dramatically during the same period.

Overall, the proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for
influenza virus was 5 percent at sentinel laboratories across
Australia, of which approximately two-thirds were pandemic influenza
viruses and one-third were seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses;
respiratory viruses other than influenza continue to predominant in
several regions of Australia.

In New Zealand, rates of ILI are below the seasonal baseline but have
increased steadily over the past month; recent reports suggest that
more significant, but geographically uneven increases may have
occurred during the 3rd week of July 2010. Although the number of
influenza virus detections remains low, the majority of virus isolates
in New Zealand have been pandemic influenza virus.

The most recent available virologic surveillance data (mid-July 2010)
from Chile and Argentina indicate that very low levels of influenza
viruses are currently circulating in the southern temperate regions of
the Americas; the predominant circulating influenza viruses in Chile
and Argentina are pandemic and seasonal influenza type B viruses,
respectively. Recently data from Chile also indicate that overall
levels of ILI in the population remain very low, except in the Los
Lagos region, which has seen recent late season increases in levels of
ILI slightly above the epidemic threshold.

India & Bangladesh
------------------
In Asia, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus
transmission currently are in parts of India, particularly in several
western and southern states. The majority of new cases continue to be
reported in the southern state of Kerala and in the western state of
Maharashtra, the latter reporting a sharp increase in the number of
cases, including small numbers of fatal cases, between the 2nd and 3rd
week of July 2010. Smaller numbers of new cases have also been
recently reported in other southern states and in the eastern state of
West Bengal.

In neighboring Bangladesh, low level co-circulation of pandemic and
seasonal influenza type B viruses continued to be detected over the
month of July 2010.

Southeast Asia
--------------
In Southeast Asia, low levels of pandemic influenza virus circulation
were detected in several countries during July 2010, including
Cambodia, Singapore and Malaysia. Significant levels of seasonal
influenza H3N2 viruses continued to circulate in Singapore.

Sub-Saharan Africa
------------------
In sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa), limited data indicate
that seasonal influenza H3N2 and B viruses continued to circulate in
parts of eastern Africa (Kenya) and central Africa (Cameroon),
respectively. Ghana, in West Africa, reported sustained transmission
of pandemic influenza virus during June and early July 2010.

Americas
--------
In the tropical regions of the Americas, active subregional
co-circulation of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses was detected
during July 2010. Since early June 2010, predominantly seasonal
influenza H3N2 viruses have circulated in Panama and Nicaragua;
predominantly seasonal influenza B viruses in El Salvador and Bolivia;
and predominantly pandemic influenza viruses in Costa Rica and Colombia.

In the temperate regions of the Northern hemisphere, pandemic and
seasonal influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically or at
very low levels during the past month.

(Countries in temperate regions are defined as those north of the
Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, while countries
in tropical regions are defined as those between these 2 latitudes.)

Description: Displayed data reflect the most recent data reported to
Flunet (<http://gamapserver.who.int/GlobalAtlas/home.asp>), WHO
regional offices or on Ministry of health websites in the last 2
weeks. The percent of specimens tested positive for influenza includes
all specimens tested positive for seasonal or pandemic influenza. The
pie charts show the distribution of virus subtypes among all specimens
that were tested positive for influenza. The available country data
were joined in larger geographical areas with similar influenza
transmission patterns to be able to give an overview
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/transmission_zones/en).

Qualitative indicators (Week 29, 2009 to Week 28, 2010: 13 Jul 2009 -
17 Jul 2010).

The qualitative indicators monitor: the global geographic spread of
influenza, trends in acute respiratory diseases, the intensity of
respiratory disease activity, and the impact of the pandemic on
health- care services.

[In brief: pandemic and seasonal flu activity across the globe is low,
but activity is increasing in some parts of the Southern Hemisphere,
with significant activity in certain tropical areas. The Southern
Hemisphere is in the midst of its regular flu season and transmission
appears to have recently peaked in South Africa, where most of the
circulating strains were influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B viruses.
In Australia and New Zealand the pace of flu detections has been
steadily increasing over the past few weeks. In Asia the most active
area of pandemic virus transmission is occurring in India, where there
may be a 2nd pandemic H1N1 wave under way. Elsewhere in Southeast
Asia, the pandemic virus is circulating at low levels in a few
countries. - Mod.CP]
