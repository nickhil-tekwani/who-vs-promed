The Dutch health institute RIVM has stopped the distribution of a
batch of Pfizer's Prevnar childhood vaccine following the death of 3
babies shortly after being vaccinated. The vaccine [?lot] has been
labeled 'do not use' and new supplies have been made available to
doctors. The exact cause of the death of the infants is not yet known,
the RIVM said. The babies died between 1 and 11 days after the
vaccination.

Following the deaths of 3 babies within a 2-week period, authorities
in Holland have banned a batch of Prevenar, also known as Prevnar,
reported Reuters. The babies all died within 2 weeks of receiving the
vaccination.

"On average about 5 to 10 deaths are reported annually after babies
get vaccines," said a spokeswoman for the Dutch health institute RIVM,
quoted Reuters. "We now have 3 cases in a short period, that is
unusual and the reason for suspending the batch," she added, noting
that RIVM is looking into the infants' cause of death.

Meanwhile, Prevenar, which is known as Prevnar in the United States,
will continue to be used. Other batches of the medication will
continue to be used in the Netherlands, said Reuters. London's
European Medicines Agency is working with Dutch authorities. Pfizer
manufactures the anti-infection vaccination, considered one of the
most popular worldwide, generating US sales for Wyeth in the amount of
[USD] 2.7 billion last year [2008], said Reuters. Wyeth was recently
acquired by "US rival Pfizer," and requested "suspension of" Prevenar
batch D66977, said RIVM in a statement, reported Reuters.

Pfizer spokeswoman Gwen Fisher, said early investigations by the drug
maker and health authorities had not revealed a link between the drug
and the fatalities, said Reuters. According to Fisher, Pfizer has
"quarantined" the batch, which contains over 100 000 doses, reported
Reuters. Prevenar is used in the prevention of pneumonia and other
similar infections. The 3 babies who received the vaccination and
later died reportedly received 2 other vaccinations, reported Reuters.

We recently wrote that a baby girl in India who died last year [2008]
during a clinical trial for Prevnar did so because of "supervisory
shortcomings," not because of vaccine problems. According to a prior
Wall Street Journal piece, the result of an Indian investigation into
the child's death will likely raise more questions about how well
Western drug companies oversee clinical trials in developing countries
like India.

The death of an Indian infant during a trial for Prevnar-13 prompted
officials in that country to shut down the study. The child died
within a week of receiving the 3rd dose of the standard (not the
experimental version) Prevnar vaccine. The Journal previously reported
that the girl never should have been allowed to participate in the
trial. According to a report from the Drugs Controller General of
India, the child's medical file indicated that a sibling died of a
cardiac problem at 4 months of age. The Journal said that fact should
have been a "red flag" to prompt medical personnel involved in the
Prevnar trial to test the infant for a heart condition.

The dead child's medical records also indicate that when she was given
the 3rd Prevnar dose she had a cough and diarrhea. According to the
Journal, the baby was admitted to the pediatric ward less than a week
later with a cough and noisy breathing. A chest X-ray revealed an
enlarged heart. A day later, she died of cardiac arrest, the
investigative report says.

Wyeth offered a detailed plan to Indian regulators to correct problems
identified at the Bangalore hospital where the death occurred and
asked Indian authorities to allow it to restart Prevnar trials at
sites other than the Bangalore hospital that were halted as a result
of the infant death.

[The 2nd news release says that, according to Dutch health institute
RIVM, Pfizer suspended Prevnar batch D66977, presumably because this
lot of vaccine was associated with the deaths of 3 Dutch infants.

Prevnar is a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) that is used in
infants and young children to protect against mucosal and invasive
diseases caused by _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (such as ear infections,
pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and meningitis). Prevnar contains
the capsular polysaccharide from 7 different pneumococcal serotypes
(that is, it is heptavalent), conjugated with diphtheria protein, and
0.125 mg of aluminum per 0.5 mL dose as aluminum phosphate adjuvant.
This heptavalent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine covers pneumococcal
serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14,18C, 19F, and 23F. For infants, the
immunization series of Prevnar consists of 3 doses of 0.5 mL each, at
approximately 2-month intervals, starting at 2 months of age,
followed by a 4th dose of 0.5 mL at 12-15 months of age. There is a
vaccination schedule for previously unvaccinated older infants and
children, who are beyond the age of the routine infant schedule.

Prevnar (PCV7) doesn't protect against the other 84 pneumococcal
serotypes. One serotype not targeted by the vaccine, 19A, is
antibiotic-resistant serotype that has become more prevalent since
Prevnar was introduced (see ProMED-mail post Strep. pneumoniae,
serotypes 5, 19A - Canada: (BC, ON) 20071111.3666.) The new
investigational vaccine referred to in one of the news releases above,
known as Prevnar 13, targets the same 7 strains as the current
Prevnar, plus 6 additional strains including 19A.

The safety of Prevnar has been evaluated in a total of 5 clinical
studies in the US, in which 18 168 infants and children received a
total of 58 699 doses of vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age.
In addition, the safety of Prevnar was evaluated in 831 Finnish
infants using the same schedule, and the overall safety profile was
similar to that in US infants. The safety of Prevnar was also
evaluated in 560 children from 4 ancillary studies in the US who
started immunization at 7 months to 9 years of age (see
<http://www.rxlist.com/prevnar-drug.htm#>). Injection site reactions
to Prevnar (such as, pain, redness, swelling, hard lump), muscle/joint
aches, or fever may occur. Allergic reactions are rare.
