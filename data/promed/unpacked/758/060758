Sunflower yields down
---------------------
Sunflower producers in the Central Plains region of Manitoba are spitting
mad over this year's [2008] harvest. Compared to the past 2 years, test
weights for sunflower seeds are down across the province, which may mean
farmers will have a hard time marketing them.

Producers across Manitoba planted 185 000 acres (74 867 ha) of sunflowers
this year [2008], and average yields are 1500 pounds (680 kg) per acre.
Although producers in the Central Plains are doing slightly better, with
averages between 1700 and 1900 pounds (771-862 kg) per acre, the numbers
are still not as good as normal.

Jim Leslie, who planted 600 acres (243 ha) of sunflower on his farm near
Poplar Point usually sees yields of 2500 pounds (1134 kg) per acre, and
this year [2008] he's bringing in between 1000 and 1800 pounds (454-816 kg)
per acre. Even more concerning for Leslie is the fact that as much as 5 per
cent of his crop has been hit with sclerotinia, a disease causing white
mold to grow on crops. "We've got lots of disease. We don't know what's
going to happen," he said.

Processors won't accept the diseased crop unless all the sunflowers are
cleaned, which is a very expensive process. "We're not sure what we're
going to do," said Leslie. "We've never had a problem with it, ever."

[The problem referred to above is most likely the fungus _Sclerotinia
sclerotiorum_, although the related species _S. minor_ has been reported to
cause similar symptoms on sunflower. _S. sclerotiorum_, also called white
mold, is one of the most nonspecific and successful of plant pathogens with
around 400 known hosts and is present worldwide. It is primarily soilborne
and has a complex disease cycle. It can survive in soil as sclerotia
(soilborne fungal bodies) and is also spread by infected plant material,
mechanical means, and wind-borne spores. Risk of crop infection depends on
the previous disease history of an area as well as weather conditions.
Disease management includes cultural practices and fungicide applications.

The pathogen causes 3 of the most important diseases of sunflower: wilt,
middle stalk rot, and head rot. Sclerotinia wilt is caused by sclerotia
infecting the roots; it is the most serious of the diseases and can destroy
whole sunflower fields. Head rot and middle stalk rot are caused by
airborne spores and are above ground diseases; they are usually associated
with wet weather periods. The presence of sclerotia in seed can reduce the
grade and market value of the crop. For more details on these diseases
please see links listed below.
