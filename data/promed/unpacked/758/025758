A total of 12 provinces and cities in Viet Nam have blue ear disease
in pigs. This disease is spreading its wings in the central province
of Quang Nam. Local authorities have decided to buy 20 000 doses of
blue ear vaccine.

Another central province, Thua Thien-Hue, has said it will allocate
VND 270 million (USD 15 900) to prevent this disease. So far, the
province has culled more than 1800 pigs.

[PRRS (Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, also named blue
ear disease) is caused by a virus which is currently classified as a
member of the newly established order of _Nidovirales_, family
_Arteriviridae_, genus _Arterivirus_. It is now ubiquitous throughout
most of the pig-rearing areas of the world and is believed to exist
in 2 main forms -- the type 1 genotype, which predominates in Europe
and the type 2, which predominates in the USA. A complicating factor
in PRRS epidemiology has been the use of live vaccines, some of which
have caused clinical disease and become established in the local pig
population. Such vaccines have allegedly been applied throughout the
world, including Asia.

Increasing data indicate that PRRSV is antigenically, genetically,
and pathologically very heterogenic.

PRRS was initially reported from Viet Nam in April 2007, allegedly
introduced from neighboring China where it had started its massive
epizootic in 2006, initially known there as "Swine High Fever
Disease." The disease, declared endemic in Viet Nam since 23 Feb
2008, has spread throughout the country. OIE's summary, including a
map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5199>.

The Chinese PRRS epizootic has been reviewed recently (May 2008) in
the paper "Highly Virulent Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory
Syndrome Virus Emerged in China" by Y.-J. Zhou, X.-F. Hao et al., in
Transboundary and Emerging Diseases, Volume 55, Issue 3-4 (p
152-164). Their abstract says:

"A highly pathogenic pig disease emerged in China in 2006, which was
characterized by prolonged high fever, red discoloration of the body,
and blue ears associated with high mortality. Porcine reproductive
and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was isolated as the single
most prominent virus in the samples collected from affected pigs. The
full-length genomic sequence of the virus revealed 2 distinct
deletions in the non-structural protein 2 (NSP2) in comparison to all
previously reported North American genotype PRRSV. Through extensive
surveys in 14 different provinces, 56 additional PRRSV isolates were
obtained from affected farms. All of the isolates were found to
contain identical deletions in NSP2. To confirm the etiology, 8
60-day-old PRRSV-free pigs were divided into 2 groups and the test
group was intranasally infected at a titer of 2 x 10(5.0) tissue
culture infectious dose 50 per pig. The inoculated pigs all died at
7, 8, 12, 16, or 21 days post-inoculation with their clinical and
pathological findings similar to those in the field. The viruses
recovered from dead pigs were identical to the inoculated virus in
NSP2 and GP5 genes. Our study shows that the recently emerged PRRSV
in China is characterized by 2 discontiguous deletions in NSP2 and is
the cause for the current epizootics in China."

In the paper's discussion chapter, the authors concluded:

"Previous studies on the genetic diversity of PRRSV circulating in
China showed a clear distinction between the 2 diverse subgroups 1
and 2 within the North American genotype. There are 2 vaccines
currently being used in China; the modified live vaccine
RespPRRS/Repro and a killed vaccine of CH-1a virus. These vaccines
appear to be less effective for the current epizootics.The viruses
for both vaccines fall in subgroup 2, whereas isolates associated
with the current epizootics belong to subgroup 1. Mutations are found
in the prime neutralizing epitope (PNE) on GP5 in the current
epizootics when compared to RespPRRS/Repro and other subgroup 2
Chinese PRRSV isolates. Additionally, the highly virulent PRRSV has
one or 2 more sites for N-linked glycosylation in GP5 in comparison
to the viruses found before 2006. In particular, novel glycosylation
sites of N33N34N35 are found to be located closer to PNE, which may
have resulted in non-recognition by the immune system.

"The sequence changes in PNE and the newly formed glycosylation near
PNE may be important for resistance of the new type PRRSV to current
vaccines. Alternatively, the new type may have gained an ability to
escape from the immunologic network in the infected hosts. During the
surveillance, 8 isolates recovered from affected farms showed almost
identical sequences to that of the RespPRRS/Repro vaccine, and these
isolates did not contain any deletion in NSP2. Thus, they were
regarded as the vaccine virus and so were likely irrelevant to the
current epizootics. The origin of etiology and other factors for
current epizootics in China need to be further investigated.

"Nevertheless, we have shown the evidence for PRRSV association with
'high fever syndrome.' The experimental infection has reproduced the
disease of high virulence and high mortality compared to the clinical
picture seen in classical PRRS. Bioinformatics and genomic analyses
also show the great sequence diversity from the previous isolates
obtained in 1996-2005.

"The role that the new type of PRRSV plays in the current epizootics
in China and the genetic factors that made the virus highly virulent
are extremely important and need to be determined further."

It will be helpful if similar studies, addressing the Viet Nam PRRS
virus, become available. - Mod.AS]
