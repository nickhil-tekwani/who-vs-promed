Pigeons and other wild birds died of bird flu in Thailand
---------------------------------------------------------
Laboratory tests have confirmed that 4 pigeons died after becoming infected
with the H5N1 bird flu virus strain, the most virulent one. The 4 birds
were part of a group of wild birds [species?!] that suddenly died one month
ago in the Suphan Buri province, Thailand. [For Suphan Buri, see Central
Thailand, Western Region, in the interactive map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Thailand>. - Mod.AS]
"We have asked all related officials to closely monitor the death of
poultry and birds. Any people that have flu-like symptoms with a history of
contacting poultry will be quarantined," said the director general of
disease control, Thawat Suntrajarn.
Wild ducks have died of bird flu infection in the north of the country, say
authorities. Poultry exports are an important part of the Thai economy; it
is the 4th largest exporter of poultry in the world. Millions of people
depend on poultry for their livelihood and sustenance.

[On 15 Jan 2007, a newswire entitled "Thailand has 1st bird flu outbreak in
6 months" was published in ProMED-mail posting 20070115.0193 (item 2). The
said outbreak was officially notified by Thailand to the OIE on 15 Jan
2007, specifying the location in the province Phitsanulok (District Muang,
subdistrict PlaiChumPol). According to the notification, the affected birds
were layer Khaki Campbell ducks about 5 months old. They were free ranged
for feeding in nearby rice fields during the day and housed by night. There
is also the important activity of wild birds that feed together with the
domestic flocks. The notification, including a map, is available at
<http://oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/Thailand_AI_15_01_2007.pdf>.
Thailand is reported to be conducting, from 3 Jan to 3 Feb 2007, its 1st
intensive surveillance this year. This outbreak is the 1st finding in 2007.
The current item suggests that the virus was circulating in December 2006
in central Thailand. - Mod.AS]
