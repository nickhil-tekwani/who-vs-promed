CWD-positive white-tailed deer found on Oneida County hunting preserve
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A white-tailed deer on an Oneida County [Wisconsin] hunting preserve has tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD), State Veterinarian Dr. Paul McGraw announced today [3 Dec 2015].

The National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, reported the final test results back to the state. The animal was a 3-year-old male and was one of about 425 deer in the 570-acre preserve.

The deer was born on the premises and shot in the preserve. Samples were taken in accordance with Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection's (DATCP's) rules, which require testing of farm-raised deer and elk when they die, go to slaughter or are killed.

The sample originally tested positive at a regional laboratory and required a confirmatory test at the NVSL. The DATCP Animal Health Division's investigation will look at the animal's history and trace movements of deer onto the property.

The business will be allowed to conduct hunts on the quarantined preserve, because properly handled dead animals leaving the premises do not pose a disease risk.

[A map of where the CWD infected deer have been found in Wisconsin can be found at http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/wildlifehabitat/documents/surveillanceplan.pdf. It has almost a random pattern to it.

Wisconsin seems to be doing a good job on surveillance, but it also seems likely they will find more CWD infected deer. - Mod.TG
