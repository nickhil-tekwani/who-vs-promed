Koala bears are infected with a virus which is inserting itself into their DNA and causing cancer, a study has found.

The marsupials are native to Australasia [and South America], only eat eucalyptus and have a range of health issues, including chlamydia and cancers such as leukaemia and lymphoma. They are also being dramatically impacted by wildfires and habitat loss.

While it is known that chlamydia is widespread among koalas, the cause of their cancers has long been a mystery. Researchers from Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin studied the DNA of 10 koalas and found a retrovirus embedded in their genome. HIV, which causes AIDS, is the most commonly known human retrovirus.

The genome-altering virus has infected the cells of koalas which create eggs and sperm, allowing the virus to be passed down the generations.

Koala retrovirus (KoRV) often inserts itself at 'hot spots' which are near genes linked with cancer, and the researchers think the mutations brought about by the virus increases the prevalence of certain cancers.

Remains of ancient retrovirus infections are commonly seen in the genomes of many vertebrates. These retrovirus relics indicate the infection occurred millions of years ago and has since been neutralised.

But analysis of 10 cancer-riddled koalas from the wild reveals the marsupial population only 1st became infected with KoRV around 50 000 years ago. Since then it has spread and it is now found in every koala in Queensland and New South Wales.

The DNA samples revealed each koala has around 80 - 100 inherited copies of KoRV in its genome. 'The genomic locations of most of these are not shared between koalas, indicating a rapid expansion and accumulation of KoRV copies in the population,' says Professor Alex Greenwood, head of wildlife diseases at the Leibniz-IZW.

'Each time a retrovirus copies and re-inserts itself into the genome, it causes a mutation, potentially disrupting gene expression, which could be detrimental to the host.'

As the virus spreads throughout a koala it slowly rewrites more of the koala's genome and replaces its original DNA. The German team found a copy of KoRV had incorporated an entire cancer-related gene into one koala's DNA sequence.

The analysis also suggests KoRV predisposes koalas to particular tumours and these genes can then also be inherited by their offspring.

[Before the discovery of the koala endogenous retrovirus (KoRV), mammalian endogenous retrovirus were thought not to produce infectious particles. KoRV retains its ability to form virus particles capable of 'de novo' horizontal infection transmission. Due to this, it is thought to be undergoing a process of 'endogenization'.

Recent investigations in koalas kept in zoos revealed the existence of 4 subtypes of KoRV, KoRV-A, KoRV-B, and KoRV-J. Different subtypes have different traits in their transmission and pathogenicity.

A recent study (https://www.pnas.org/content/117/17/9529) described the 1st exogenous retrovirus in bats, the Hervey pteropid gammaretrovirus (HPG) in northeast Australia. Koala populations are currently in severe decline and at risk from KoRV, which is closely related to HPG. HPG is also related to the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV), which suggests that the origins of KoRV and GALV are spill-over from bats.

Koalas are at an early state of the endogenization process of KoRV, and so the extinction of the exogenous retroviral counterpart and genomic fixation may not be reached for hundreds of years. Until that happens, koalas must endure and overcome the impact on their health, including increased cancer rates.
