Type E botulism to blame for bird deaths, MNR says
--------------------------------------------------
About 1000 dead birds washed up on along a 3 km [2 mi] stretch of
Nottawasaga Bay shoreline on the weekend [22-23 Oct 2011].

Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) clean-up crews were in the Wasaga
Beach area on Monday [24 Oct 2011] to dispose of carcasses on
provincial park property.

The largest number was found near Allenwood Beach, northeast of the
main beach area. At least 1000 dead birds had washed up on shore.

The ministry hasn't done a survey to confirm how many birds washed up
as of Monday, but MNR spokesman John Cooper says the number is
unusually high for this area.

Cooper says this sort of die-off -- in terms of time of year and
species -- is typical of type E botulism, a potentially fatal form of
bacteria. "We had a much smaller die-off at this time of year last
year [2010] in this area," said Cooper, adding there were hundreds
last year as opposed to thousands this year.

The ministry received sporadic reports of dead fish and birds
beginning in late August 2011, but cases increased in frequency and
distribution in the past month, with the steepest increase in dead
birds occurring at the end of last week and over the weekend [21-23
Oct 2011].

"We've had some recent stormy conditions that have washed many of
these birds up on shore," said Cooper, adding it appears the birds
were already dead when they washed up.

"It's a factor of wind currents, with the strong winds we've had
recently, because these are birds that normally would be out in the
deeper water," Cooper said.

Reports from the public suggest the birds are mainly long-tailed
ducks, but also include loons and grebes, he added.

"These aren't birds that are in the marshes or shallow areas along the
lakeshore," Cooper said "They could be dying out there and their
bodies may never make it to shore."

In an earlier interview, Cooper said botulism is a "naturally
occurring event" and little is known about the ecology of the
bacterium which produces the botulism toxin.

The bacterium naturally occurs as harmless spores in lake-bottom
sediment. Under certain conditions -- rich nutrient source, lack of
oxygen, and optimum temperature -- the bacterium begins producing the
toxin. It then enters the food chain, primarily affecting birds and
fish.

Some birds likely ingested the toxin by eating bottom-feeding fish
which have died and floated to the water's surface. In the case of the
long-tailed duck, they dive and pick up food from the bottom of the
lake, making it more likely for them to ingest the toxin. Cooper says
this is the largest bird die-off the Georgian Bay area has seen, but
there have been much larger die-offs in the Great Lakes, pointing to a
case in eastern Lake Erie about a decade ago when about 18 000 birds
died. The fish die-offs include channel fish, freshwater drum, carp,
and lake whitefish.

Wasaga Beach Provincial Park staff have disposed of about 120 dead
sturgeon. Cooper says sturgeon, and other fish that swim and feed
along the bottom, are most prone to contamination.

Samples were sent to the University of Guelph on 6 Oct 2011 to test
for fish and bird diseases, including the type E botulism toxin, which
Cooper says is quite likely the cause. The ministry is still waiting
for results. Cooper says the botulism toxin takes effect within a day
and people should be wary of abnormally behaving fish and birds. [How
interesting! The title leads one to believe that type E botulism has
been confirmed, and this paragraph says, "quite likelyâ€š" clearly
indicating that it has not been officially confirmed. - Mod.TG]

He says the toxin is very susceptible to heat and fish should be
cooked thoroughly.

Cooper says the bacteria become active in dead organisms, so the
ministry is advising people to keep their children and pets away from
dead animals on the shoreline.

The ministry is cleaning up provincial park land and private
landowners are responsible for disposing of fish or birds on their
property. Cooper says there are 3 options: leave the carcass and let
it decay, bury it, or double-bag it for municipal waste pickup. [If
the birds and fish are left to decay, then the problem only
perpetuates itself. As maggots move into the carcasses those maggots
are perfect food for other birds. As those birds come to feed they are
ingesting the botulism and there will be more dead birds. Leaving the
dead carcasses is not only smelly, but causes the die off to be much
larger. - Mod.TG]

He says if landowners choose to dispose of the birds, they should wear
gloves and wash up after.

Cooper says these birds and fish don't pose a health risk to humans
and the toxin is not in the water.

Several members of the Hamilton Conservation Authority parks
management were at a local conference and stopped by the Allenwood
Beach to see if the dead birds were still on-site Monday [24 Oct
2011].

Evidence of zebra mussels convinced Bruce MacKenzie, Hamilton Parks
superintendent that Lake Huron was suffering the same fate they had in
Lake Erie in 2004.

"It has to be the right water conditions, and a whole bunch of things
have to line up," said MacKenzie. "But when I saw the zebra mussels --
they look like little crabs -- that's what we were seeing, too."

MacKenzie said they filled a 40-yard [37 m] dumpster with dead ducks
and loons from a 16 km [10 mi] stretch along the Burlington Skyway
Bridge that allows Fort Erie to empty into Lake Ontario.

"It seems to be a fall thing," he said.

Together with park manager Brian Hall, they walked along the stretch
of Allenwood Beach where the birds had washed ashore last Friday [21
Oct 2011]. Hall explained that in 1988, indiscriminate ships from
Europe that were supposed to empty their ballast (holds) out at sea,
left it too late and dumped their dirty water -- including zebra
mussels and another invasive species called the goby fish -- into the
Great Lakes.
