Epidemiological comments: most of the affected herds were vaccinated
within the last year.

Ten of the outbreaks have been typed and found as due to type O.

The herds which have not been typed yet are Majdal Shams and Rahat.
Ben Ammi and Qela are suspected.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine, movement control inside the country,
zoning, vaccination in response to the outbreak(s), no treatment of
affected animals

Measures to be applied: screening, disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s)

[An interactive map showing all Israel's FMD outbreaks since Apr 2011
is available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10529.
An earlier outbreak, in March 2011, has been reported separately
though apparently belonging to the same 2011 FMDV (serotype O)
epizootic (Israel's primary outbreak); see summary with interactive
map at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10345.

The Virology Division at Israel's Kimron Veterinary Institute
(Beit-Dagan) includes a unit for molecular virology. This unit, headed
by Dr Y Stram, has been engaged since the 1990s in the methodical
genotyping of FMDV isolates. A recent publication addressed
phylogenetic analysis of representative FMD viruses isolated during
the major outbreaks in Israel from 1989 to 2007.

Stram Y, Engel O, Rubinstein M, et al. Multiple invasions of O1 FMDV
serotype into Israel revealed by genetic analysis of VP1 genes of
Israeli's isolates from 1989 to 2007. Vet Microbiol. 2011; 147(3-4);
398-402. Its abstract is reproduced below:

Abstract
---------
"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), one of the most dangerous
viruses affecting cloven-hoofed animals, comprises 7 serotypes that do
not mutually cross-protect, with a total of about 80 subtypes. The
Middle East is an FMD-endemic region, with repeated FMD outbreaks. In
spite of its compulsory vaccination policy, in Israel outbreaks occur
repeatedly. In order to compare the Israeli isolates, the complete
viral VP1 genes of representative viruses isolated during the major
outbreaks from 1989 to 2007 were sequenced and subjected to
phylogenetic analysis, which showed that each outbreak was initiated
by introduction of a new virus lineage and not by endemic and resident
viruses. The differences between the nucleotide sequences of the
viruses from the various outbreaks were too big to fit a model of
outbreaks caused by endemic virus. Based on this approach, it was
revealed that the 2002 outbreak was originated by viruses that
circulated in the Arabian peninsula in 1997-1998."

It would be interesting to obtain results of the Unit's 2011's
genotyping. - Mod.AS]
