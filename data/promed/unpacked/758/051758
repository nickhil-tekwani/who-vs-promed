Alberta is declaring a provincial outbreak following a continued rapid rise of syphilis cases across the province. "Sexually transmitted infections are a risk to anyone who is sexually active, particularly people who have new sex partners and are not using protection," said Dr Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health. Hinshaw said testing and treatment are freely available to Albertans. "I encourage anyone who is sexually active to get tested regularly," she said.

Alberta Health Services [AHS] says cases of infectious syphilis [primary and secondary syphilis] have reached a rate unseen in the province since 1948, with the number of cases growing 10-fold over a 4-year period: from 161 cases in 2014 to 1536 in 2018. There were additional 22 cases of congenital syphilis, which occurs when a child is born to a mother carrying the disease, according to AHS.

The health authority says condom use is among the best ways to guard against the infection. It is encouraging anyone who is sexually active to get tested every 3 to 6 months if they have a partner with a sexually transmitted disease, a new sexual partner, or have been sexually assaulted.

Edmonton saw 977 cases in 2018, an increase of 305.4 per cent [a 3-fold increase. - Mod.SH], according to AHS statistics.

[The news report above says that there has been an almost 10-fold increase in primary and secondary syphilis from 161 cases in 2014 to 1536 in 2018 in the Canadian province of Alberta. There were 22 congenital syphilis cases between 2014 and 2018.

Alberta is divided into 5 health zones; a map showing the location of these zones can be found at https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/ahs-map-ahs-zones.pdf. Edmonton is the capital city of Alberta, located in the center of the province. Although the Edmonton Zone has one of the highest case counts, incidence rates, and percentage increase in 2018 compared to 2017 with 977 cases (75.4 cases per 100 000), an increase of 305.4 per cent in 2018 compared to 2017, syphilis also increased in 2018 in the other Alberta health zones: in the North Zone -- 208 cases (43.4 cases per 100 000), an increase of 324.5 per cent; Calgary Zone -- 206 cases (13.3 cases per 100 000), an increase of 7.3 per cent; Central Zone -- 88 cases (18.7 cases per 100 000), an increase of 266.7 per cent; and South Zone -- 31 cases (10.4 cases per 100 000), an increase of 138.5 per cent (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/syphilis-alberta-health-outbreak-warning-1.5213851).

ProMED-mail recently posted reports of syphilis outbreaks in the Northwestern subregion of the Canadian province of Ontario that is said to be linked to a similar outbreak in Winnipeg, the capital city of the Canadian province of Manitoba, where it was attributed to the rise in injecting drug (methamphetamine) use. Transmission of syphilis in injection drug users may occur as a consequence of sharing a needle/syringe contaminated with infected blood from somebody who has primary or secondary syphilis (https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/archive/newsrel/health/04-28TransmissionSyphilis.asp), but more likely the infection is acquired by the practice of exchanging drugs for sex and high-risk sexual behaviors, such as multiple partners and inconsistent condom use (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9147154 and https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6806a4.htm).

Winnipeg is about 1300 km [about 800 mi] southeast of Edmonton, separated by the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. A map showing the location of Alberta can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Winnipeg,+Manitoba,+Canada/Edmonton,+AB,+Canada.

The news report above provides no further information on the epidemiology of the outbreak in Alberta. More information on this would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
