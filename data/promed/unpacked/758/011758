In Vietnam 84,500 people have been infected by dengue fever and 186 died by
August 15, Vietnam news agency reported Friday. The number increased three
and four fold over the same period last year, the preventive medicine
department said.
The disease is spreading mainly in Vietnam's central and Mekong Delta
provinces. The worst is the Mekong Delta province of Ben Tre with 13,332
patients including 25 deaths. There are 8,844 patients in the central
province of Quang Tri. The number of patients is unlikely to decline in the
provinces of Kien Giang, An Giang, Dac Lac, Quang Binh and Kon Tum.
Vietnam's Health Minister Do Nguyen Phuong demanded the Hanoi Institute of
Traditional Medicine and the army to study and produce easy-to-use
traditional medicine packages to help the prevention and control of the
disease. He also suggested the government to set up a dengue fever control
program, which requires 5.5 billion Vietnamese Dong (about 400,000 U.S.
dollars).
