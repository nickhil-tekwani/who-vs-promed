On 5 Nov 2020, the Ministry of Environment and Food of Denmark announced the culling of all mink in the country, estimated to total approximately 17 million animals. (1)

The circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had already been observed several months earlier, but the reason for the policy change was an alert from the Danish National Institute of Public Health, which found that viruses had spilled back from mink farms into the community, and that during the passage through mink, the virus had accumulated mutations in the spike protein gene. (2)

Spike mutations are scrutinised because the spike is crucial for docking of SARS-CoV-2 to human cells and, therefore, a key target for vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. (3)

Preliminary analyses suggested that SARS-CoV-2 isolated from mink in Denmark was less easily neutralised by antibodies in 2 of 9 humans that had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 without the mutations. The effect was small but caused widespread concern in the media, suggesting that the vaccines under development would potentially be rendered useless. (2)

Following review of the evidence, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and WHO concluded that the risk for the population at large was not increased but stressed the importance of surveillance at the human-animal interface and rapid exchange of information between virologists and epidemiologists to track possible viral changes that could be of concern. (4,5).

The example of Denmark is a warning: spillover of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to mink and minks to humans is not a new finding. It was 1st reported in the Netherlands in April 2020 and since has been found in Spain, Italy, the USA, Sweden, and Greece. (4) In most countries, the 1st infections on mink farms were identified through contact tracing following confirmation of COVID-19 in symptomatic humans.

Mink belong to the Mustelidae family, which includes ferrets, which have been used as an animal model owing to their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.(6) Efficient transmission between ferrets has been shown in experimental infections, with spread to naive animals through direct contact but also through indirect airborne spread. (7)

According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Europe has an estimated 2750 mink farms and produces more than 27 million pelts per year. As farmed minks are kept in large groups and housed in pens in wire cages with bedding that generates a lot of dust, there is ample opportunity for transmission once the virus is introduced on the farms. Introduction and spread might go unnoticed as infected farms have been detected through serosurveys, suggesting that disease might be mild or inapparent, although upper and lower respiratory tract infection and symptoms have been documented as well. (8,9).

There is some evidence that susceptibility differs depending on breed, suggesting a genetic susceptibility factor that could be worth exploring [for example, compare Dutch minks with Utah's, where high mortality rates were reported. - Mod.AS]. Once introduced, experience in Denmark and the Netherlands has shown that it might be difficult to stop transmission. Ongoing farm-to-farm transmission has been observed, and investigations are exploring the modes of transmission between farms. (10)

The unbridled spread of an emerging virus in a new host leads to accumulation of mutations. Most farms in the Netherlands developed a farm-specific genomic signature that was then used to confirm that the people on the farm were infected by the viruses from the animals. Some of the mutations observed in the viral genome sequences taken from Danish and Dutch mink farms are suggestive of adaptation of the virus to this new host. (2,10)

Although it is plausible that adaptation to mink would reduce the fitness of the viruses for humans, that is not a given. A major concern is the potential formation of a non-human reservoir from where the viruses could be reintroduced once circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is suppressed or even stopped. Mink farms harbour high numbers of animals. In the Netherlands, the number of mink that have been culled following SARS-CoV-2 confirmation is more than 2.7 million, 6.5 times more than the total number of human registered cases. It is unclear how the virus is transmitted between farms, and although a role of humans is considered, SARS-CoV-2 could potentially be introduced to escaped and wild mustelids or other wildlife. (11) A parallel with influenza pandemics comes to mind: Avian and swine influenza viruses continue to evolve in their animal hosts, constituting a permanent pandemic threat. (12) Therefore, although the number of human cases from contact with infected mink is negligible compared with those from the human epidemic, the risk of reservoir establishment with unforeseeable consequences has been the basis for the decisions to cull farms in the Netherlands and Denmark. In addition, the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in these animals raises questions about a possible role as intermediary hosts in the early stages of the pandemic.

In early November [2020], WHO announced a much-needed study into the origins of SARS-CoV-2 (13) [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-convened-global-study-of-the-origins-of-sars-cov-2]. This study will need to go beyond what is currently known, including exploring the role of a range of animals kept for food, fur, or other products. There are also lessons to learn for the fur sector in other countries: there is currently no global overview of the location of such farms, and no mandatory surveillance programme. In view of our observations, that is urgently needed.

Netherlands exercised during its COVID-19 in minks event a remarkable One Health approach and transparency. The early detection was followed by science-based measures, coordinated with shareholders. All activities were coordinated between the ministries of Health and of Agriculture, who consulted with shareholders and continuously reported their findings and activities in publicly available letters to the parliament. The ministries were/are assisted by 2 consulting expert groups: the "animal health experts group" and the "expert council zoonoses (DB-Z)," which is part of the so-called "zoonosis structure." This council, established within the "lessons learned" actions which followed a major Q-fever epidemic of 2010 in North Brabant, consists of scientists and experts in the areas of human and animal infectious diseases. The DB-Z answers ministerial questions about the interaction between animal health and public health.

Notably, a report of the animal health expert group, which was submitted by the Minister of Agriculture to the parliament on 22 April 2020 (prior to the COVID-19 in mink event!), included -- inter alia -- the following segment (translated from the Dutch): "Since ferrets appear susceptible to infection, and minks are closely related to ferrets, it is possible that minks may also get infected by CoV-2. No research has been done on mink;" (https://cdn.nieuweoogst.nu/public/file/171175.pdf). This example demonstrates the role the expert group could and has played prior to the event as well as during its evolvement; this includes the indication of research needed.

On 26 Apr 2020, 3 days after the 1st confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in minks, the Dutch CVO was already in state to submit to the OIE a letter notifying the 1st cases and presenting prospects, measures, and research undertaken and planned in a common effort shared by diagnostic, research, and implementation institutions. An abridged version of the letter was included in ProMED post 20200503.7294846.

The call of Dr Koopmans to get information on the number and location of mink farms globally, and making them publicly available, should be supported. On top of health issues, quantitative and geographic information on farmed fur animals deserve becoming addressed at the earliest. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) comes to mind as the candidate of choice for the collection and publication of such information. OIE has obtained and disseminated information on SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals since the earliest stages of the pandemic. Fur animals are not addressed as such in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code; however, member states were required to report COVID-19 in animals, based upon its definition as an "emerging" disease in mink, the latter being an "animal." OIE is, in fact, intensively engaged in combatting this emerging zoonotic disease in animals (details to be found in OIE's COVID-19 Portal at https://tinyurl.com/wfpedwb).

OIE's WAHIS interface presents, in the section "country information," sub-section "animal population," the (annually updated) number of animals, per species, density, and number of establishments (See: https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalpopulation; select a region/country/year).

Allowing the inclusion of minks in the WAHIS database and requiring member countries to submit the relevant figures (numbers of breeding minks and of their farms/holdings) are warranted. - Mod.AS
