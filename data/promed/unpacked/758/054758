Crops advancing in Manitoba, but diseases becoming widespread
-------------------------------------------------------------
Crop diseases were common across the province, Manitoba Agriculture
indicated. Barley yellow dwarf disease was widespread in cereal crops in
southwestern Manitoba, and was causing severe damage in some fields. The
disease was also seen in central Manitoba.
Leaf rust was a concern in cereal crops in southwestern Manitoba. Root rot
was evident in wheat fields in the northwest, while fusarium head blight
was present in the early- and late-seeded spring wheat in central regions.
Blackleg and sclerotinia were reported in central Manitoba's canola crops.
