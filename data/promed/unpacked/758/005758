[According to Nigeria's reports to the OIE during the recent 5 years, the annual number of reported rabies cases in dogs were the following: 2007: 2; 2008: 23; 2009: 24; 2010: 5; 2011: 11; during January-June 2012: 6 cases. No cases in other species have been reported hitherto. The improved reporting is commendable.

The location of the current outbreak is indicated in the interactive map at the source URL above.

Human rabies cases were reported to the OIE every year without quantitative data.

Noteworthy, the OIE has developed a new concept of Vaccine Bank, which creates virtual rolling stocks: the supplier (selected OIE compliant vaccine production company) produces the vaccines when needed or they remain with the supplier at its own risk and are renewed on a rolling basis under terms and conditions contractually defined with the OIE. This revised concept enables the rapid supply of emergency stock of vaccines to infected countries in order to vaccinate animal populations at risk and to progressively achieve eradication wherever possible. 20 percent of the vaccine bank budget has been earmarked for the oral immunization campaigns of stray dogs against rabies; see http://tinyurl.com/9yvk9tz.
