Response to FMD in Zambia Digest 2004 #117: suspected FMD spreads in Zambia
-------------------------------------------
Clinical material (2 samples from mouth and 2 from foot lesions) was
submitted to the Exotic Diseases Division [EDD], Onderstepoort Veterinary
Institute, on 12 Mar 2004. It was stated that one sample was taken from
healed lesions.
No virus could be isolated on primary pig kidney cells from any of the
samples despite 2 blind passages. The polymerase chain reaction was
negative as well as the sandwich ELISA-detecting antigen. In order to
obtain a diagnosis, the Zambian authorities are urged to submit fresh
samples to the EDD for further testing.

[We are very grateful for Dr Vosloo's expedient response to our posting
20040423.1126. We hope her good advice will be urgently followed.
Detailed sampling directions, including methods of collection, transport
fluids, and temperature during transportation are described in detail in
OIE's Manual <http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00022.htm>. For
laboratory diagnosis, the tissue of choice is epithelium. Ideally, at least
1 g of epithelial tissue should be collected from an unruptured or recently
ruptured vesicle.
Where epithelial tissue is not available from ruminant animals, for example
in advanced or convalescent cases, or where infection is suspected in the
absence of clinical signs, samples of OP fluid can be collected by means of
a probang (sputum) cup. - Mod.AS]
