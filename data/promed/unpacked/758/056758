I have been buying ribavirin over-the-counter in Mexico. Depending on the
exchange rate, I pay $42 to $60 for a box of eighteen 400 mg capsules. It
is readily available in the larger, store front pharmacies in Tijuana, Mexico.
Since your 24 Mar 1997, do you have any more recent information on U.S. or
mail order sources and prices.
