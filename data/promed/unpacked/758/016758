Malaysia: outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease in Penang
------------------------------------------------------------
The Health Ministry is uncertain whether the hand, foot and mouth disease
(HFMD) outbreak that affected some 20 children in Penang is caused by a
coxsackievirus [or possibly enterovirus 71? - Mod.CP], the Ministry's
Parliamentary Secretary Lee Kah Choon said. Confirming that cases reported
in Penang over the past 2 weeks were HFMD, Lee said the ministry was
monitoring the situation closely.
It was reported that 3 kindergartens, which were closed last week after
some of their pre-schoolers were affected by the HFMD, had reopened on
Wednesday. Lee was speaking to reporters yesterday after launching the
Allergy and Asthma book written by Dr Manmohan Yadav and his son Dr Aravind
Yadav at Pantai Medical Centre here. Lee said the authorities had advised
the 3 affected kindergartens in Penang to close for a week, and the period
could be extended depending on the situation.
In Penang, state Health, Welfare and Caring Society Committee chairman PK
Subbaiyah said 2 children, both aged 3, and a 46 day old baby at the
Tanjung Bungah relief centre had symptoms such as mouth ulcers and blisters
on hands last week, and that they had recovered.

Malaysia: outbreak of hand foot and mouth disease in Penang
-----------------------------------------------------------
37 children in Penang have come down with hand, foot and mouth disease
(HFMD) since 1 Jan 2005. But [the causative agent has not yet been
identified]. Dr Ramlee Rahmat, the director of the Health Ministry's
Communicable Disease Control Division, noted that there were 67
enteroviruses known to cause HFMD. "We have to [identify] the virus that is
attacking the children," he said, adding that enterovirus 71, was [possibly
the most dangerous virus], having killed many of the 31 children affected
an outbreak in 1997. Dr Ramlee said that, although no deaths had been
reported so far this year, the authorities were on the alert for new cases.
Since 2000, Penang had recorded many cases of HFMD. In 2000 there were 459
cases followed by 776 in 2001, 1384 in 2002, 436 in 2003, and 364 last year.
Dr Ramlee said that many children below 5 years of age in Penang could have
come down with HFM because of poor personal hygiene and improper
sanitation. Dr Ramlee said the 334 sentinel centres -- 106 private and 119
government health clinics and 109 treatment centres nationwide -- were
closely monitoring the situation. He said specimens taken from HFMD victims
had been sent for sent for analysis. So far results showed they suffered
normal symptoms of hand-foot-mouth disease.

[HFMD is predominantly a disease of childhood, usually associated with
coxsackievirus A16 or enterovirus 71 infection, and less frequently with
various other A and B coxsackieviruses. More severe disease in a minority
of patients has been associated with enterovirus 71 infection in some Asian
countries. Typical cases of HFMD have vesicles and ulcers in the mouth and
on the tongue, and a vesicular exanthem usually located on the palms and
soles. Recovery from HFMD is usually complete within 1 or 2 weeks. - Mod.CP]
