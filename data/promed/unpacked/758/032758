The use of cow urine has been reported to be efficient in controlling
several plant diseases caused by bacteria and fungi. See the
following links (both in Portuguese)
<http://www.pesagro.rj.gov.br/urina.html> and
<http://www.unipinhal.edu.br/ojs/ecossistema/include/getdoc.php?id=175&article=54&mode=pdf>.
You may also search for articles in Brazilian Phytopathology at

or
Brazilian Horticulture at
<http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php/script_sci_serial/pid_0102-0536/lng_en/nrm_iso>.
However, I must add that the scientific basis for the use of cow
urine in plant disease control is sketchy at best. Its proponents
will usually argue that the minerals in cow urine render plants more
tolerant to diseases in general, but most experiments that I have
seen lack appropriate controls.
By the way, I do NOT work on this subject, neither am I advocating
[the use of cow urine]. I am simply pointing out some existing
sources of information.
