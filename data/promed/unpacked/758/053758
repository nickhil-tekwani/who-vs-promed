Boulder officials believe high heat and recent rains led to an algae bloom in Tantra Lake that killed hundreds of fish over the weekend. The die-off alarmed residents of the nearby apartments, who worried that some kind of chemical exposure may have been to blame.

But Andy Taylor, of Boulder's Water Quality and Environmental Services, said that after an inspection of the south Boulder lake on [Mon 24 Jul 2017] afternoon, officials believe it was algae that ultimately killed the fish. "That pulls the oxygen out of the water," Taylor explained.

Taylor said tests at the small lake at 1000 W. Moorhead Circle showed high pH levels and that the water temperature was 85 degrees. "That's more basic than the fish prefer," Taylor said.

Crews contracted by Boulder Housing Partners -- which manages the privately owned property -- were on scene cleaning up the dead fish, but it may take them until [Tue 25 Jul 2017] to fully clean the pond. "There's a lot of fish in there," Taylor said.

Another firm hired by Boulder Housing Partners is conducting water quality and algae testing. Boulder officials said there is nothing so far to suggest there's any larger risk to the city's stormwater system.

Melissa Miller said she 1st noticed the dead fish [Sun 23 Jul 2017] morning while walking around the lake, which is surrounded by the Tantra Lake Apartments. "It just smelled like fish," Miller said. "I thought maybe a fisherman had left a fish on the grass, but then I saw all of them."

The dead fish, ranging from small ones measuring only a few inches to larger fish that were several feet long, could still be seen [Mon 24 Jul 2017] morning floating by the hundreds in the lake, and the smell of dead fish lingered in the air.

Miller has lived in the area for 5 years and had never seen anything like it. "It's extremely frightening," Miller said. "It's usually a mecca of wildlife." The guppies, frogs and turtles in the pond seemed unaffected, but Miller also said that she didn't see any of the larger fish dead until [Mon 24 Jul 2017].

Resident James Hougen said the fact that different sizes and species of fish had all died was especially puzzling. "It's extremely concerning," he said. "You have to wonder if it's some sort of chemical in the water."

Jeremy Durham, executive director of with Boulder Housing Partners, late [Mon 24 Jul 2017] afternoon released a statement, saying, "We appreciate everyone's patience while we work to address things in a safe and efficient manner."

Miller said she called the apartment complex's management office on [Sun 23 Jul 2017] but had not heard back. "It makes you worried about your own pets," she said. "What if your dog eats the grass? I don't know what this is."

Before Boulder officials examined Tantra Lake, Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokeswoman Jennifer Churchill speculated the fish deaths could be weather-related. "It is likely a summer fishkill due to the high heat," Churchill said.

Summer fishkills have happened before in Boulder County, including once in Gunbarrel and once in Louisville.

[The most common cause of fish die-offs as the one described is reduced oxygen in the water, which in turn may be caused to several factors that might interact among them, such as drought, algae bloom, overpopulation, or an increase in water temperature. According to the text, the most likely origin of this episode is a combination of climatic and limnological factors that predisposed to algal blooms and decay of biological material that depleted the oxygen in the lake. - PMB
