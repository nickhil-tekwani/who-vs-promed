An outbreak of Kyasanur Forest disease [KFD], also known as monkey fever, has been reported in some villages of Shivamogga district, following which authorities have taken measures, including vaccination, to combat it, a health official said on Thursday [3 Jan 2019].

A team of doctors and paramedics was deputed to the affected areas, and a door-to-door verification was on to identify people affected by KFD, Shivamogga District Surveillance Officer (DSO) Dr B S Shankarappa said.

Allaying fears, he said early diagnosis was the key to control KFD, a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever endemic to South Asia, and people with poor immunity levels might be more susceptible to it.

Since the disease is transmitted by ticks, the district authorities were distributing insect repellent, and a vaccination drive was also underway, the DSO said.

The virus spreads through parasitic ticks which latch on to monkeys and is transmitted to humans through tick bites. It was 1st reported in the country from Kyasanur forests in Shivamogga district in 1957 and, hence, came to be known as KFD.

The KFD infection, which starts with high fever and body ache, results in hemorrhage, similar to that in dengue.

BJP MLA from Sagar constituency in the district H Halappa claimed that 4 people from as many villages had died due to the fever in the current outbreak. Shankarappa, however, declined to confirm or deny the casualty figure. "We have deputed 3 doctors there. Paramedical staff have also been deputed. Door-to door verification is also going on to identify affected people," he said.

People with complications due to the fever were being referred to hospitals equipped to deal with such cases, he said, adding that a campaign was on to sensitise people.

Speaking to reporters, Halappa said that at least 22 people were suffering from the disease. He had apprised Chief Minister H D Kumarawamy about the situation, the MLA added.

Monkey fever cases have been reported in neighbouring Maharashtra and Goa in areas closer to forests over the years.

An outbreak of monkey fever [Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD)] has claimed 5 lives in Sagar taluk of Karnataka's Shivamogga district. So far, 2000 people dwelling across 7 villages have been vaccinated in order to contain the disease. As of [4 Jan 2019], 15 cases were reported positive from Aralagodu village.

Monkey fever starts with high fever, vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, and body aches and is often mistaken as viral fever. It is similar to dengue and results in haemorrhage.

"Every year, we get around 400 cases of KFD, but most are cured after treatment. This time, we are providing all the necessary measures. We have taken blood samples of 75 people, out of which only 15 have been positive," Dr Prabhakar, director of the Health Services Department, told CNN News 18.

However, villagers say that they have lost faith in the health officials, and they allege that timely action by the department could have prevented the deaths. "Health officials woke up only after the deaths. The vaccine takes time to react, which is why people who were administered the vaccine have also started showing symptoms," said an Aralagodu resident.

Another resident claimed that the primary health care centres are not properly equipped; as a result, blood samples are being sent to KMC [Kasturba Medical College] in Manipal or Bengaluru, which is delaying treatment.

The 1st death due to KFD was reported from Shivamogga in early December [2018]. Forest officials had then connected it to the deaths of over 50 monkeys in Sharavathi. The department then brought out an order banning tourists from entering the Sharavathi Wildlife Sanctuary.

KFD was 1st reported in 1957 in Shivamogga district. It is a vector-borne disease transmitted to humans via infected ticks found on monkeys. It was highlighted when wild monkeys were found dead in the forest due to the infection.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is caused by Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the virus family Flaviviridae. KFDV was identified in 1957 when it was isolated from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur Forest in Karnataka (formerly Mysore) state, India (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/index.html).

Transmission of the virus to humans may occur after a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, most pertinently a sick or recently dead monkey. No person-to-person transmission has been described. Stringent bio-safety measures have to be ensured while disposing of any dead monkeys in KFD-endemic areas in India. KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with the increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease. The current outbreak is linked with monkey deaths, which were followed by human cases, with a total of 15 cases reported to date.

Vaccination and personal protective measures against tick bites are keys to preventing KFD. There is a need to create community awareness on how to avoid tick bites, and KFD vaccination facilities should be extended in the affected areas as mentioned in the report. Also, efforts at animal surveillance for KFD should be undertaken as an early warning for risk of human infections. - Mod.UBA
