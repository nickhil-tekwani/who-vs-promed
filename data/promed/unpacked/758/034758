Subject: Clarification re bird poop
-----------------------------------
Vultures, like all flying birds that I know of, defecate chiefly upon
takeoff. This is to lighten their load upon entering an environment
where hauling anything extra can be a handicap.

Just watch a bird, any bird, closely enough to see what actually
happens when they take off: they flex their knees and extend their
wings, which causes their sphincters to contract, and out flies the
guano from the hind end, right as the bird leaps into the air and
begins to either flap or glide, depending on where the bird was roosting.

Thus, technically, the bird is pooping while flying, because the bird
is almost always airborne at the exact moment the guano is excreted.
However, close to 100 percent of the poop lands within a few feet of
wherever the bird roosted.

Ain't been on the poop beat for 40-odd years for nothing.

[And I think that on that common sense observation by Merritt, we can
close the thread on avian defaecation. Thank you, Merritt. - Mod.MHJ]
