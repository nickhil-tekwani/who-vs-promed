Videoconference between the Ministry of Health and the CDC Atlanta
----------
This Thu 13 Sep 2018, the minister of health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, chaired a videoconference between Kinshasa Emergency Operations Center (EOC), Beni NUC, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Atlanta. This videoconference is an extension of the collaboration between the Ministry of Health and the CDC and the visit of CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) last August [2018]. After a short word of welcome by the minister of health, the Beni-based response coordinator, Dr Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathe, presented the current dynamics of the epidemic. Secondly, exchanges focused on identifying and monitoring contacts in affected areas and progress in vaccination. The various stakeholders decided to make these videoconferences each week in order to share the respective analyses on the situation and the latest developments of the epidemic.

Vaccination
Since the beginning of the vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 8738 people have been vaccinated, including 3654 in Mabalako, 2656 in Beni, 1328 in Mandima, 544 in Butembo, 220 in Masereka, 150 in Katwa, 121 in Oicha, and 65 in Kinshasa (medical staff to deploy).

[Good communication during an outbreak is critical, thus weekly conversations among the groups involved in the control efforts is an excellent idea to stay on top of the Ebola situation, which, while slowing, is still very serious, as evidenced by the increase in cases to 137 noted above. - Mod.LK]

Ebola infects 5 more in DRC, lifting total to 137
--------------------
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), in updates yesterday and today [Wed 12 Sep 2018 and Thu 13 Sep 2018], reported 5 more confirmed Ebola cases, including 2 from the urban hub of Butembo, one of which involves a health worker from a clinic where the city's 1st case had been treated.

In a related development, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in an update yesterday [Wed 12 Sep 2018] that a lot of progress has been made in 6 weeks, and cases and deaths in the past week declined significantly. It added, however, that community resistance, weak infection prevention and control practices in health centers, and risk of virus spreading to insecure areas are still major threats.

Some areas have stabilized, but the WHO said Beni is the new hot spot, and response activities are scaling up to ease the impact of potential clusters in Butembo and in Masereka health zone, the latest new areas to report cases. "The coming few days will be critical in determining the trajectory of the outbreak," the agency said.

Latest cases make 4 in Butembo
---------------
The newly reported cases include 2 from Mabalako, one from Beni, and 2 from Butembo, lifting the outbreak total to 137, including 106 confirmed and 31 probable cases. Fatal cases held steady at 92.

Butembo, North Kivu province's 2nd-largest city and home to nearly 1 million people, now has 4 confirmed cases. Earlier cases include a patient who fled from the Beni outbreak hot spot and a man who fled from Ituri province and whose illness was diagnosed retroactively in Butembo based on a semen sample.

The newly reported illness in a healthcare worker means that 18 have now been sickened in the DRC's latest outbreak. Healthcare-worker infections are a concern, not only because they are a key part of the frontline response, but also because their illnesses are known to amplify Ebola outbreaks. [...]

Butembo response scale-up
--------------
In its weekly update, the WHO said surveillance activities have been extended to Butembo and Masereka.

In Butembo, an operations hub has been opened as a base for outbreak response coordinators, and an emergency operations center is expected to begin operating within the coming days. Also, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and the health ministry are building a 10-bed Ebola treatment center in Butembo, which is expected to begin operating by the end of the week.

Regarding experimental treatments, 29 patients have received investigational drugs, including 14 who received mAb114, 9 who got the antiviral drug remdesivir, and 6 who received Zmapp. The WHO noted that, so far, 43 vaccination rings have been identified, plus 13 rings of healthcare and other frontline workers.

[3] WHO: Disease Outbreak News
Fri 14 Sep 2018. Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs), edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/don/14-september-2018-ebola-drc/en/

Six weeks into the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the overall situation has improved since the height of the epidemic; however, significant risks remain surrounding the continued detections of sporadic cases within Mabalako, Beni, and Butembo health zones in North Kivu province. While the majority of communities have welcomed response measures, such as daily contact monitoring and vaccination where appropriate, in some, risks of transmission and poor disease outcomes have been amplified by unfavourable behaviours, with reluctance to adopt prevention and risk-mitigation behaviours. There have been challenges with contact-tracing activities due to the constant movement of people between health zones, individuals hiding when symptoms develop, and reports of community resistance. Risks are heightened by continued transmission in local health facilities because of poor infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, sporadic reports of unsafe burials, and the detection of cases in hard-to-reach and insecure areas.

Since the last Disease Outbreak News (data as of 5 Sep), 8 new EVD cases, all of which are confirmed, have been reported: 3 from Beni, 3 from Butembo, and 2 from Mabalako health zones. All 8 new cases have been directly linked to an ongoing transmission chain stemming from a community in Beni.

Of the 3 new cases in Butembo, one was an adult male from Mangina who reported an earlier illness and then was laboratory confirmed post-recovery via testing of a semen sample when his spouse was diagnosed with EVD. Given that he was asymptomatic since travelling to Butembo, the risk of onward transmission from this individual is minimal. The other 2 cases were health workers who cared for a subsequently confirmed case (reported in the last Disease Outbreak News) at a small health post and assisted in her transfer to a tertiary hospital. This brings the total to 19 reported cases among health workers: 18 were laboratory confirmed and 3 have died. All 19 exposures occurred in local health facilities outside of dedicated Ebola treatment centres (ETCs).

As of Wed 12 Sep 2018, a total of 137 EVD cases (106 confirmed and 31 probable), including 92 deaths (61 confirmed and 31 probable) have been reported in 7 health zones in North Kivu province (Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Mabalako, Masereka, Musienene, and Oicha), and Mandima health zone in Ituri Province (Figure 1). An overall decreasing trend in weekly case incidence continues (Figure 2); however, these trends must be interpreted with caution given the expected delays in case reporting and the ongoing detection of sporadic cases. Of the 130 probable and confirmed cases for whom age and sex information is known, adults aged 35-44 years (22 percent) and females (57 percent) accounted for the greatest proportion of cases (Figure 3).

Alerts for suspected viral haemorrhagic fever cases in the outbreak-affected areas, other provinces of the DRC, and neighbouring countries continue to be closely monitored and rapidly investigated. In the outbreak-affected areas, 15-31 new alerts were reported each day during the past week, of which 4-16 alerts were verified as new suspected cases requiring further investigation and testing. As of [Wed 12 Sep 2018], 17 suspected cases are currently pending testing to confirm or exclude EVD. Moreover, EVD was ruled out for recent alerts from Kasaji, Tanganyika, Tshopo, and Kinshasa provinces, as well as for all alerts from neighbouring countries.

Public-health response
--------------
The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, safe and dignified burials, cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces. WHO and partners are also conducting preparedness activities in neighbouring countries.

As of [Thu 13 Sep 2018], 190 experts are deployed by WHO to support response activities including emergency coordinators, epidemiologists, laboratory experts, logisticians, clinical-care specialists, communicators, and community-engagement specialists.

Over 5500 contacts have been registered to date, of which 1751 remain under surveillance as of [Wed 12 Sep 2018] (1). Of these, 75-92 percent were followed-up with daily during the past week (2). A dip in contact-tracing performance rates observed earlier in the week was partly attributed to delays and challenges in establishing contact-tracing teams around recent cases in Butembo and Masereka health zones. Response teams are working to address these challenges, and improvements in the proportion of contacts successfully reached have been observed in recent days. Strategies are being reviewed to ensure those at high risk of disease are prioritized, rapidly detected, isolated, and admitted for treatment if symptoms develop.

As of [Thu 13 Sep 2018], 52 vaccination rings have been defined, in addition to 17 rings of health workers and other frontline workers. These rings include the contacts (and their contacts) of 55 confirmed cases from the last 3 weeks. To date, 8902 people consented and were vaccinated, including 2951 healthcare or frontline workers and 2054 children.

To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research, and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries. These include the UN secretariat; sister agencies, including International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), multiple clusters, and peacekeeping operations; World Bank and regional development banks; African Union, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and regional agencies; Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), steering committee, technical networks, and operational partners; and the Emergency Medical Team Initiative. GOARN partners continue to support the response through deployment for response and readiness activities in non-affected provinces and in neighbouring countries.

ETCs are fully operational in Beni and Mangina with support from the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), respectively. MSF Switzerland and the MoH are building a 10-bed ETC in Butembo, which is expected to be operational by [Sat 15 Sep 2018] and will replace the current transit centre. In Beni, ALIMA is planning to expand treatment capacity over the next 2 weeks. A 20-bed ETC is being constructed in Makeke in Ituri province with the support of International Medical Corps (IMC), which is expected to be operational during the week of [Mon 17 Sep 2018]. An MSF transit centre is already operational in Makeke. Samaritan's Purse continues to support the isolation unit in Bunia.

ETCs continue to provide therapeutics under the monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions (MEURI) protocol in collaboration with the MoH and the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB). WHO is providing technical clinical expertise onsite and is assisting with the creation of a data safety management board.

The MoH, WHO, UNICEF, Red Cross, and partners are intensifying activities to engage with local communities in Beni, Butembo, and Mangina. Local leaders, religious leaders, opinion leaders, and community networks such as youth groups and motorbike taxi drivers are being engaged on a daily basis to support community outreach for Ebola prevention and early care-seeking through active dialogues on radio and interpersonal communication. Community feedback is being systematically collected, and their concerns are being addressed. Local frontline community outreach workers are working closely with Ebola response teams to strengthen community engagement and psychosocial support in contact tracing, patient care, and safe and dignified burials (SDBs). The current focus is to intensify activities aimed at addressing community concerns through direct partnership with community members.

The Red Cross of the DRC, with support from the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), are coordinating SDBs. As of [Wed 12 Sep 2018], Red Cross has established 3 operational bases in Beni, Mangina, and Butembo; in total, 10 SDB teams are operational. To date, 124 SDBs are reported to have been successfully conducted. Red Cross has supported the training of civil protection SDB teams to ensure operational capacity in hard-to-reach areas.

Health screening has been established at 37 Points of Entry (PoE) and more than 3 million travellers have been screened at these PoEs.

WHO risk assessment
-----------
This outbreak of EVD is affecting northeastern provinces of the DRC, which border Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g., cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis) and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri continues to hinder the implementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public-health risk was assessed to be high at the national and regional levels and low globally.

As the risk of national and regional spread remains high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure health authorities are alerted and are operationally ready to respond.

WHO advice
------------
WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the DRC based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no countries have implemented any travel restriction to and from the DRC. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.
