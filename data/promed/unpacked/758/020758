South African businessman dies of spotted fever in Brazil
---------------------------------------------------------
The death of a South African businessman in Rio de Janeiro was caused by
spotted fever, Brazil's Ministry of Health said on Sunday [7 Dec 2008].
"The investigation carried out throughout the week by our teams concluded
that it is a spotted fever infection," said Eduardo Hage, an official of
the ministry.

The 53 year old South African national reported symptoms of spotted fever 2
days after arriving in Brazil on 23 Nov 2008 and died on 2 Dec 2008. "That
means his infection started in his country of origin" in South Africa, Hage
said. As spotted fever is transmitted only through the bite of ticks,
"there is no risk of transmission from one person to another and therefore
no risk of spreading to the population," the official added. Spotted fever
is not a specific disease in Brazil. It occurs worldwide.

From 1997 to 2008, 641 cases were reported in Brazil. The fatality rate is
about 30 per cent.

[According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
website (<http://www.cdc.gov/ticks/index.html>) tickborne rickettsial
diseases (TBRD) are a set of distinct diseases with similar signs and
symptoms that are transmitted to humans by tick bites. In the United
States, these diseases include Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF),
ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, and emerging diseases such as _Rickettsia
parkeri_ infection. The reported incidence of these diseases has increased
during the previous decade. The illnesses associated with these diseases
can vary from mild symptoms treated at home, to severe infections requiring
hospital treatment, with the potential for death in rare cases. Although
easily treated with the antibiotic doxycycline, these diseases can be
difficult for physicians to appropriately suspect and diagnose. But early
recognition and treatment of infection is important to decrease the risk
for serious outcome. Preventing exposure to ticks and tick habitat is
important to prevent exposure to TBRD. RMSF is the most severe tickborne
rickettsial illness in the United States. This disease is caused by
infection with the bacterial organism _R. rickettsii_.

In addition to _R. rickettsii_, the agent of RMSF, there are other similar
agents transmitted by ticks that have been shown to cause human infections.
In the US, these include _R. parkeri_ and _R. phillipi_ (proposed). It is
likely that some human illnesses currently being attributed to RMSF are
actually caused by these distinct rickettsial species, and more research is
needed to determine their prevalence and geographic distribution.

Further information is awaited on the precise identity of the agent
responsible for the death of the South African patient in Brazil. - Mod.CP]
