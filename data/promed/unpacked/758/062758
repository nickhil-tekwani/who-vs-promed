4 More MERS Cases, a Total of 126 people

The Ministry of Health and Welfare's MERS-CoV Task Force has confirmed 4 additional positive cases of MERS-CoV on 12 Jun 2015 (actual date of confirmation 11 Jun 2015).

3 patients out of those who were diagnosed on 11 Jun 2015 had been infected at Samsung Medical Center 27 - 29 May 2015, while 1 patient was exposed at Good Morning Hospital on 57 May 2015 and believed to have come in contact with the virus through patient no.14.

On the other hand, among the cases that were published on 11 Jun 2015, the epidemiological investigations of 5 people were also released. [Yesterday's announcement dated 11 Jun 2015, had 5 individuals where possible contact information was not available. This is now information on those 5 cases. - Mod.MPP]

- 2 patients out of those who were diagnosed on 10 Jun 2015 had been infected at Samsung Medical Center 27-29 May 2015 [felt to be contact with case no.14].
- 2 patients were exposed at Good Morning Hospital 25-27 2015 and also believed to have come in contact with the virus through patient no.14.

Intermediate survey determined that the remaining 1 patient (case no.119) was most likely infected by case no.52 in the Pyeongtaek Bagae hospital emergency room. Case no.119 was admitted to Pyeongtaek Bagae hospital on the night of 31 May 2015, the same time that case no.52 was admitted to Pyeontaek Bagae hospital with fever that developed while on self-isolation.

[As of 12 Jun 2015 there are now 126 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by South Korea, including 10 deaths. In the past 24 hours there have been 4 newly confirmed cases, 3 of which had been in the Samsung Hospital emergency department during the period 27-29 May 2015 when case no.14 was admitted there and waiting for a bed in the hospital. The 4th case was exposed to case no.14 at the All Good Morning Hospital in Pyeongtaek on 27 May 2015. Of the 5 cases reported yesterday (11 Jun 2015) that at the time did not have a known direct epidemiologic link, 2 were exposed to case no.14 at the Samsung Hospital emergency department between 27-29 May 2015, and 2 were exposed to case no.14 at the All Good Morning Hospital in Pyeongtaek between 25-27 May 2015. Conclusion: patients continue to be identified in South Korea, but it seems as though the exposure periods for transmission were in the end of May 2015. Hopefully, there will not be a new wave of cases exposed after 1 Jun 2015, demonstrating that control measures implemented are having an effect on interrupting transmission of MERS-CoV in South Korea (yes, I'm being optimistic here). It is important to note that at present there have been 3 generations of cases, and case 119 is a 3rd-generation case. Case no.52 was a 2nd-generation case having been exposed to the index case in St. Mary's hospital -- "hospital B" -- hence, all cases thus far identified following the index case, were either 2nd- or 3rd-generation cases. - Mod.MPP]

[The total number of cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection now reported by South Korea is 126, including 10 fatalities. All 10 of the fatal cases had significant pre-existing co-morbidities that put them at high risk for morbidity and mortality for any infectious disease, especially respiratory viruses such as MERS-CoV, SARS, or influenza virus. It is noteworthy that the majority of cases of MERS-CoV were in individuals who were in the hospital (or hospital emergency room) for other illnesses when they were exposed to MERS-CoV. Hence, more severe illness presentations would not be surprising. - Mod.MPP]

1st outpatient contracts MERS
Containment effort at Samsung Medical Center feared to be breached
-----------------
An outpatient at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul has been diagnosed with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the 1st infection outside the hospital's emergency room where a confirmed patient spread the disease to 54 others, health authorities said Thursday [11 Jun 2015].

The new case suggests that the virus could be transmitted via air. Virus experts have said infection by the MERS virus is usually through direct contact with patients or exposure to their coughing.

Including the new case, a total of 122 people have contracted the virus. One more death, a 75-year-old lung cancer patient, was reported Thursday [11 Jun 2015], raising the death toll to 10.

The disease seems to be spreading to southern parts of the country, as several residents there have been confirmed with the disease after visiting hospitals in Seoul and nearby metropolitan areas.

The ministry said a 77-year-old woman who received treatment at the hospital's orthopedics department as an outpatient on [27 May 2015] was infected with MERS.

So far, all the infections from the hospital had been limited to people who visited the emergency room where the nation's 14th patient stayed for 3 days. The ministry thus said an outbreak in areas of the hospital other than the emergency room was unlikely.

Both the orthopedics department and the emergency room are on the 1st floor, but the 2 are not close. Between them is the radiology department.

"The patient had an X-ray, and after that visited a restroom in the emergency room section. Through surveillance camera recordings within the hospital, we are examining if she was exposed to the 14th patient there," a hospital official said.

The ministry ruled out the possibility of airborne infection.

Her case was found as the government has been checking all pneumonia patients nationwide since Wednesday [10 Jun 2015], and she was at a clinic in Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province, with pneumonia symptoms. The ministry is continuing the checks.

As of Thursday [11 Jun 2015], 122 people were confirmed to have contracted the disease, up 14 from the previous day.

8 of the new cases were from Samsung Medical Center, including a pregnant woman. She initially tested positive, then negative, and finally positive. The 39-year-old had been hospitalized there ahead of her due date in the middle of this month [June 2015], and went to the emergency room as her mother was there with stomach problems.

"She has mild symptoms and is in a stable condition," a ministry official said. "If mild symptoms continue and she tests negative next week, she may have a normal delivery. But if her condition worsens, a Caesarean operation will be an option."

Another newly confirmed case is a police officer at Pyeongtaek Police Station in Gyeonggi Province, where the nation's 1st MERS patient visited several hospitals there before Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital confirmed he had the disease [20 May 2015].

He showed a fever after meeting a friend who came from Saudi Arabia on [26 and 28 May 2015], and so visited the Good Samarian Bagae Hospital, [1 Jun 2015]. He initially tested positive, but later negative in a 2nd test, and was released [4 Jun 2015].

But the symptoms worsened, and he was confirmed infected on Thursday [11 Jun 2015].

The ministry suspects he did not contract the virus from the friend but from Bagae Hospital, where another MERS patient visited the same day. However, it is still examining the exact source of infection.

Officials said some 3800 people have been isolated at government-designated facilities or their homes. Affected regions are also growing, with cases in Boseong, South Jeolla Province and Okcheon, North Chungcheong Province being confirmed.

4 more patients have recovered and been released from quarantine facilities, including an Air Force chief master sergeant at Osan Air Base in Gyeonggi Province, bringing the total recovered cases to 7.

The ministry said it would announce a list of "safe hospitals" that will treat non-MERS patients with respiratory problems.

[The media statement "Containment effort at Samsung Medical Center feared to be breached" is very misleading, as the patient's date of contact was 27 May 2015, before adequate control measures were implemented in hospitals treating patients infected with the MERS-CoV. Given the large number of patients who were exposed to the MERS-CoV in the emergency department of Samsung Hospital during the period 27-29 May 2015, it is highly likely that the patient who was in the OPD but used the bathroom in the emergency department was exposed to the MERS-CoV during her sojourn into the emergency department. We still do not know if transmission is purely droplet infection, aerolized virus from nebulizer treatment of patients with respiratory distress, or perhaps even fomites -- all these routes were seen with SARS-CoV, a cousin of the MERS-CoV.

The media report mentions several provinces in the south of Korea that have had cases confirmed (Boseong, South Jeolla Province and Okcheon, North Chungcheong Province).

Deadly delay: Long ER waits aggravate South Korea MERS spread
-------------------------------
The man who became South Korea's MERS patient number 14 waited 2.5 days in the emergency ward for a bed to open at a prestigious Seoul hospital -- not an unusually long time for the city's top medical centers.

By the time the 35-year-old was suspected of infection with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), nearly 900 hospital staff, visitors and patients had been through the emergency ward.

Of those, 55 were infected with MERS, including 4 elderly patients who have died while the rest are in quarantine, putting the hospital at the center of an outbreak that has infected 122, with 10 dead.

South Korea has a sophisticated healthcare system and universal insurance. But there are gaps, including the custom of waiting for days for a coveted bed at a top hospital, as well as the practice of families making lengthy visits to hospitalized relatives, often providing de facto nursing care.

Both are blamed for helping spread the often-deadly MERS virus, prompting calls for change. South Korea's Health Ministry has promised to fix the emergency room bottlenecks.

"We will make a plan to stop the emergency room from being used as the waiting room for those who are trying to be admitted," Kwon Deok-cheol, the health ministry's chief policy official said on Thursday, without giving details.

Before his MERS diagnosis, patient 14 was hospitalized in the same ward in Pyeongtaek city, 65 km (40 miles) southwest of Seoul, as the country's 1st MERS patient, who had developed the illness after returning from a trip to the Middle East in early May 2015 but was also not diagnosed at the time.

Suffering from fever, patient 14 visited another hospital in the city, spending 3 days there before his doctor advised him to go to a bigger facility. The man rode a bus to Seoul in the hope of being treated at the prestigious Samsung Medical Center, founded by a Samsung Group foundation, where the conglomerate's 73-year-old patriarch remains hospitalized after a heart attack more than a year ago. The patient felt so poorly on arrival in Seoul on [27 May 2015] that he called an ambulance, which brought him to the hospital in the city's wealthy Gangnam district.

Doctors treated him in different parts of the emergency ward for symptoms of pneumonia while waiting for an available room, according to the hospital. The patient, who slept on a bed, was not considered a MERS risk because he had not been to the Middle East and his contact with the 1st patient was not then known.

It was only when authorities notified the hospital on the evening of [29 May 2015] that they suspected the man had been exposed to the 1st MERS patient in Pyeongtaek that he was moved from the emergency ward and diagnosed the next day [30 May 2015].

"He came here with symptoms of pneumonia, but had been waiting to be admitted, just like other patients," a hospital official said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.

South Korea is not short of hospital beds -- the overall number per 1000 people is more than twice the OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] average according to the most recent statistics -- but prestigious Seoul hospitals are magnets for patients from around the country.

The average wait for admission to the Samsung Medical Center at this time of year is about 3 days, as many older people become sick with the change of season, the hospital official said. The most urgent cases take priority.

Among MERS cases traced to patient 14 is a pregnant woman who went to the ER to visit her mother, who was there with an upset stomach, according to the health ministry. The pregnant woman's parents were also infected in the emergency ward.

"In South Korea, patients' relatives follow in emergency rooms ... Look at the pregnant woman's case. We need to look into every single problem as we are dealing with MERS," an official at the Korean Hospital Association said.

"The system is still weak compared with the size of the industry."

[What is described above is not that unusual with respect to major metropolitan hospital emergency rooms elsewhere in the world. I used to work in similar emergency rooms in New York City (NYC) and we had many a patient that was admitted to the emergency room holding area due to lack of available beds in the hospital. This situation has been changing in NYC through the insistence of 3rd-party payers. The realities are simply overcrowding, patients seeking attention at the known "premium hospitals" where care is thought to be optimal, and suboptimal infection control procedures -- too few negative-pressure isolation rooms, too few single-bedded rooms, etc, etc. - Mod.MPP]

[5] South Korea, need to overhaul hospital system - media report

Interview: Hospital system needs overhaul for MERS: WHO official
-------------------
South Korea's hospital system needs to be overhauled to prevent the recurrence of an ongoing Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) crisis here, co-head of the World Health Organization (WHO)-South Korea joint mission said Wednesday [10 Jun 2015] .

"As (MERS) patients developed symptoms, they visited big hospitals with better facilities and equipment without any prior notice. It resulted in infections of medical staff [members] and families of the patients in defenseless state," Dr. Lee Jong-koo, chief of JW Lee Center for Global Medicine under Seoul National University College of Medicine, said in a written interview with Xinhua.

Lee is co-heading the joint mission along with Dr. Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general for health security at the WHO. The 16-member team is scheduled to end its 5-day joint study of the country's MERS spread by Saturday [13 Jun 2015].

MERS infections here surged to 122 on Thursday [11 Jun 2015], just 3 weeks after the 1st case was reported on [20 May 2015]. The country has become the most MERS-contagious outside of Saudi Arabia, where the disease emerged first in 2012, and more than 1000 cases have since been identified.

"In our country, patients are allowed to select a hospital, into which they check, in emergency situations," said Lee, indicating that most of patients flocked into biggest hospitals, where the vast majority of cases were discovered.

36 infectees came from Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital in the city of the same name, some 60 km south of Seoul, where patient zero was hospitalized [for the 2nd time]. The 1st patient infected some 30 others there.

Before arriving at the Pyeongtaek hospital, the 68-year-old man visited a small clinic to get referrals to the bigger hospital. After visiting another small clinic in Seoul, he was referred to the Samsung Medical Center in the capital city where doctors confirmed him as the patient zero of the viral disease.

The 14th patient, who had contracted the virus from the patient zero in Pyeongtaek, checked into the emergency room of the Samsung hospital, infecting a whopping 47 people. 2 big hospitals in the central city of Daejeon detected 9 and 8 MERS cases each.

"[We need] to restrict the transfer of patients to emergency rooms without any advance notice," said Dr. Lee.

Most of emergency rooms of South Korea's big hospitals are jam-packed with beds and seats, [increasing the] possibility for the spread of contagious diseases within hospitals. The health authorities said no MERS infections have been found outside of hospitals.

Lee also talked of the need to increase the isolation units of lower atmospheric pressure than the surrounding air and the isolation rooms for high-fever patients in emergency wards to prevent the spread of contagious diseases within hospitals. Such units prevent the virus from going outside, as air flows from high to low pressure.

South Korea reportedly has only 105 low-pressure isolation units in 17 hospitals nationwide. Single-bed rooms, in which MERS infectees can be treated, stand merely at 47, as the remainders are multi-bed rooms.

The health authorities said it would separate confirmed patients from potential carriers by treating them at separate hospitals.

The confirmed patients will be treated at 16 hospitals having low-pressure isolation units. The potential carriers of the virus will get medical care at 32 hospitals, where MERS cases were confirmed or visited in the past.

Dr. Lee expressed a relatively optimistic view about containing the MERS spread, as the country has hospitals with advanced facilities and equipment.

"Unlike those in the Middle East, cases that caused pneumonia were less than 50 percent (in South Korea). Fatality rate was about 7 percent, lower than 40 percent known (in the Middle East)," said Lee, attributing the figures to better equipment and facilities in South Korean hospitals.

[Unfortunately it seemed to have been the perfect storm... overcrowding of hospitals, "hospital shopping" behavior seeking the right facility, too few appropriate isolation facilities, combined with lack of awareness among the population and the healthcare sector of the importance of a history of travel when diagnosing a febrile illness. As I've mentioned in an earlier post, during the initial peak and panic associated with the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, a case of EVD (Ebola virus disease) was treated in an emergency room in the USA and sent home without suspicion of EVD. From the ProMED perspective, it's a pity that there isn't more widespread awareness of emerging diseases worldwide among healthcare workers on a regular basis, with the recognition that we live in a global village -- only a plane ride from the other side of the world....
