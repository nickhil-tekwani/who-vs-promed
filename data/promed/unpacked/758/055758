Babies Facing Disease Threat
--------------------------------------
A new report from the Australian Pediatric Surveillance Unit warns
that adults are unknowingly exposing their newborn infants to
whooping cough, because they are unaware that as adults, they can
still contract the disease. Over the past 2 years, 9 infants have
died from whooping cough in Australia, and the report found that over
half of all reported cases are researchers are calling for greater
use of adult booster shots.
Dr. Peter McIntyre, deputy director of the National Center for
Immunization Research, noted that adults should be aware that they,
too, can become infected with pertussis, adding that "anyone who is
thinking about getting pregnant or who has just had a baby should
think seriously about having a booster."

Whooping Cough Spreads
------------------------------
Health officials in British Columbia, Canada, last week declared an
epidemic of pertussis in Fraser Valley. There have been 29 cases
already this year (2002), and last year there were 86 confirmed cases
of the disease -- up significantly from the 20 cases recorded in
2000. In the past 2 months, there have only been 2 cases recorded in
Vancouver, where the immunization rate for children is over 90
percent; however, most of the Valley cases are in Chilliwack and
Agassiz, where the immunization rate for toddlers is just 71 percent.
Dr. Andrew Larder, a medical officer in Fraser Valley, said Friday
that the spread of the disease is likely because there are many
"conscientious objectors" to vaccines in the Valley, as well as a
large number of children who have been vaccinated but who have since
lost the 5-year immunity the shot affords [indicating, I think, that
the boosters for starting school were not always given. - Mod.LL].

[The above represent additional reports of the increasing recognition
of pertussis reservoirs in adults (Australia) and increasing
pertussis (Canada). Undoubtedly lower-than-ideal DTaP vaccination
coverage in children and waning vaccine immunity in adults are major
factors. Several reports have questioned whether the organism itself
has become able to break though vaccine protection. If that were the
case, however, there should be more cases in fully immunized young
children. - Mod.LL]
