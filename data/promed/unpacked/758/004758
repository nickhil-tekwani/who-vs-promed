Yellow fever in Senegal - WHO Update 6
--------------------------------------
As of Thu 28 Nov 2002, the Ministry of Health has confirmed 60 cases and 11
deaths from yellow fever -- see previous report:
<http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news/n2002/november/20november2002.html
>
Recent confirmed cases have been detected in Kolda, Diourbel, and Fatick
regions. The dates of onset of illness for the 2 most recent confirmed cases
were 11 and 13 Nov 2002 in Thies and Kolda regions, respectively.
As reported previously, laboratory testing suggests that one case (onset of
symptoms was 9 Nov 2002) has occurred in Dakar, but a thorough
epidemiological investigation of this case and active surveillance in Dakar
have not detected additional cases.
The outbreak has affected: Touba, Mbacke, and Bambey districts, Diourbel
region; Gossas, Fatick and Guinguineo districts, Fatick region; Darou Mousty
and Kebemer districts, Louga region; Khombole and Thiadiaye districts, Thies
region; Tambacounda district in Tambacounda region; Sedhiou district in
Kolda region; and Dakar Centre district, Dakar region.
Immunization campaigns in Tambacounda, Khombole, Thiadiaye, Guingineo,
Kebemer, and Darou Mousty districts will begin within the next week. WHO is
supporting these immunization campaigns with both technical assistance and
vaccine supplies.
A plan for intensified social mobilization has been formulated by the
Ministry of Health with WHO technical assistance. Financial support is being
provided by WHO and the local office of the Children's Vaccine Program at
PATH (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health). Several local partners,
including CVP, UNICEF and WHO, will support implementation. In response to
an appeal for financial support for the outbreak response, WHO wishes to
acknowledge the support of the Governments of Norway & Belgium, UNFPA, and
the Gates Foundation.
