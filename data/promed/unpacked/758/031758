Russia will provide Armenia with a new vaccine against foot and mouth disease, Armenia's State Food Safety Service reported today [21 Jan 2016], following talks in Moscow between Armen Hayrapetyan, the head of the agency and Sergei Dankvart, the head of the Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (Rosselkhoznadzor).

"The sides stressed the special importance of the joint fight against acute infectious diseases of animals. The Russian Federal Centre for Animal Health was instructed to produce a vaccine for the prevention of foot and mouth disease in animals, which will contain a new strain of AG-VII FMD virus at the request of Armenia", the agency said in a statement. It said this strain has recently been recorded in neighboring Iran and Turkey.

The agency said that deputy head of the Rosselkhoznadzor Nikolai Vlasov, will visit Armenia soon to discuss the prospects of cooperation and other topical issues.

[The FMD virus serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype VII (hence "FMDV-A Asia VII"), originating in south Asia (Indian subcontinent including Bangladesh) has reportedly spread recently to 4 Near-East countries (in brackets, start of the event according to the country's initial notification to the OIE): Iran (30 Aug 2015), Saudi Arabia (13 Sep 2015), Turkey (29 Sep 2015), and Armenia (23 Dec 2015).

According to the official information from Iran, suspected samples were initially collected from fattening calves illegally introduced in a big fattening complex in Asgarlou, Jafriyeh, Qom (a map is included in the OIE report; see http://tinyurl.com/glnpyn8). The origin of these calves was traced to Miyandoab live animal market located in West Azarbijan province (about 100 km [62 mi] from the 3-country border junction Iran/Iraq (Kurdistan)/Turkey; see at http://tinyurl.com/hvwmzys).

FMD virus serotype A was detected at that point in time by ELISA in Iran's Central Veterinary Laboratory (Razi Institute, Tehran). Then, the samples were sent to the Pirbright Institute, UK, for advanced analysis. The Pirbright Institute categorized this strain as "genotype VII" in FMD Genotyping Report dated 4 Dec 2015. This was followed by Iran's notification of "a new strain" to the OIE, which appeared to have, in fact, preceded the outbreaks in Turkey and Saudi Arabia.

This strain, which according to WRLFMD (World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease) genotyping results is related to strains from India and Bangladesh, has been reportedly affecting cattle, sheep, and swine; mortalities have been reported. It causes concern in the affected countries and throughout the region, as well as in neighbouring Europe, particularly since available vaccines were found not to confer protection against it. Turkey is currently vaccinating cattle with vaccines said to include the new strain, produced by the Turkish national FMD centre; vaccine-matching studies are ongoing, their results anticipated.

It is encouraging to note that the effort to produce a protective vaccine matching 'FMDV-A Asia VII' has been undertaken also by the Russian Federal Centre for Animal Health ("Federal Governmental Institute, Centre for Animal Health (FGI-ARRIAH), Yur'evets, Vladimir, Russia) which is one of OIE's reference laboratories for FMD. Details on their new vaccine, when available, particularly matching tests results, would be appreciated.

In the meantime, affected Iran, Armenia, and Saudi Arabia are expected to apply severe animal-movement restrictions. The virus may have spread beyond the reported outbreaks (the distance between Miyandoab and Jafriyeh, in Iran, is about 600 km [373 mi]!).

Official information on the FMD situation in other countries in the region, particularly Iraq (Kurdistan), Syria, Jordan, and the Gulf states, as well as follow-up reports from the 4 affected countries, are to be expected.

ProMED-mail's requests for information from India on the availability there of vaccines matching 'FMDV-A Asia VII' are pending. - Mod.AS
