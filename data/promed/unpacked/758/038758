The devastating effects of the sheep-aborting disease _Salmonella
[enterica_ serotype] Brandenburg [infection] have been reinforced in a
recent survey by VetSouth.

55 surveys were completed by VetSouth clients in Southland and West
Otago, with 38 per cent of the farmers having had instances of
abortion and more than 75 per cent of those farmers attributing it to
_Salmonella_ Brandenburg.

The aim of the survey was to get a broader outline of what was
happening in the area, how widespread the disease was, how farmers
were coping with it, whether they were vaccinating against it, and
what results they were getting from vaccinating, Gore-based
veterinarian Rebecca Vallis said.

Not only did the disease cause abortion but it also made ewes
seriously ill, with several farmers reporting losses of between 100
and 180 ewes. Coupled with the fact that it often occurred in
twin-bearing ewes, it was having a "huge" economic impact,
particularly for southern farmers who had lost large numbers of lambs
in the storm last September 2010. It was "gutting" for farmers to not
only have to pick up aborted lambs from their paddocks, but also to
deal with ill ewes.

Since initially being found in Canterbury, _Salmonella_ Brandenburg
gradually moved south but not north. The reason for that was not
known. It was very infectious and spread easily between flocks, with
black-backed gulls being a major culprit.

The majority of surveyed farmers who vaccinated their ewes had not had
their flocks affected by the disease. Vaccination, while recommended,
was not 100 per cent reliable, because so many other factors were
involved. It was recommended that farmers vaccinate a month before the
risk period and, for most farms, that meant June-July.

Stress also had an impact; if a sheep's immune system could not cope,
then it was more susceptible to the disease, so reducing stress on
animals was advised.

The survey had given VetSouth more insight into what was happening in
the area and a base for building on, Ms Vallis said.

[_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Brandenburg is a bacterium, which
affects the intestinal tract of animals. Those animals that survive
become carriers. Salmonellas can survive for 9 months or more in the
environment in sites such as moist soil, water, faecal particles, and
animal feeds. The disease can be spread by anything that takes mud and
faeces from paddock to paddock, like gumboots and vehicle tires.

Since _Salmonella_ Brandenburg was 1st diagnosed in a mid-Canterbury
sheep farm, the bacterium has caused widespread abortions and deaths
in pregnant ewes in mid and South Canterbury, coastal Otago, and
Southland. _S_. Brandenburg abortions occur from about 80 days of
gestation with a peak from 100 to 120 days (Bailey 1997, Clark 2000).
In cattle, the same strain of organism has also caused diarrhoea and
dysentery in calves and adult cattle, and abortions and deaths in 1st
calvers and to a lesser extent in 2nd calvers (Clark 2001). The
bacteria have also been isolated from a one-month-old and 10-month-old
foal with diarrhoea, goats with diarrhoea, and dogs with diarrhoea,
metritis, and an infection in the male reproductive tract. The disease
is an important occupational hazard, as a number of farmers, their
families, including children and farm workers have contracted the
disease as well as 3 veterinary practitioners (Clark 2001).

The Occupational Safety and Health Service (OSH) is concerned about
the danger to human health following the spread of sheep infection
with _Salmonella_ Brandenburg. The disease is potentially fatal to
sheep and has now spread to dairy herds causing diarrhoea and
abortions in cows, and diarrhoea, dysentery and deaths in young
calves. The disease can also cause serious illness in humans, with
victims laid low for up to 6 weeks with severe diarrhoea, stomach
cramps, and fever, with periodic relapses for months after.

Additional information on _Salmonella_ Brandenburg may be found in
ProMED-mail post 20090919.3285. All indications are this is becoming a
major problem in New Zealand, and the Brandenburg strain seems to be
spreading geographically and through various species. Clearly,
producers are urged to vaccinate. - Mod.TG]
