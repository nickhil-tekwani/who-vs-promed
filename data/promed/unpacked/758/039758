Bird flu recurs in Viet Nam
---------------------------
Bird flu has recurred in Nam Dinh and Soc Trang provinces in Viet Nam
with 2 flocks of ducks testing positive for the H5N1 virus, a local
newspaper reports.

The avian influenza virus was detected in a flock of 630 ducks
belonging to a farmer in southern province of Soc Trang's Thanh Thoi
Thuan Commune after 500 of them died during the Tet (Lunar New Year)
holiday. The remaining ducklings in the flock were reportedly killed.
None of the 45-day-old ducks had been vaccinated.

In the northern province of Nam Dinh's Nghi An Commune, bird flu hit a
7-month-old flock. Provincial animal heath officials killed all 270
ducks in an effort to contain the disease.
