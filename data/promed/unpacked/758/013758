[Cases continue to be identified in Saudi Arabia. Today's (26 Oct 2014) MOH report brings the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia to 777 including 331 deaths (case fatality rate 42.6 per cent). It appears as though there may now be nosocomial transmission ongoing in Riyadh, as both newly confirmed cases were from Riyadh today: one was a fatal case who did not have identifiable risk factors other than a history of pre-existing co-morbidities; the other newly reported case is a healthcare worker with a history of a "possible" contact with a suspected or confirmed MERS-CoV case in the healthcare environment. Twitter chatter on this latter case today mentioned that media reports suggested this healthcare worker was a physician. I was unable to find a media report to provide a corroborative link in either the Arabic or English media.

The 2 fatalities reported today (26 Oct 2014) included one who was just confirmed today and another from Taif who most likely was the case with a history of exposure to camels who was confirmed on 21 Oct 2014, when he was admitted to hospital (see MERS-CoV (39): Saudi Arabia, new cases, deaths 20141021.2887774).
