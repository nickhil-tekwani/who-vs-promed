A mysterious disease has appeared in Ethiopia causing bleeding from the nose and mouth before the patient fell dead due to an infection [or poisoning - Mod.TG], according to what was reported by the British Daily Mail newspaper on Sunday [1 Mar 2020]. [It is thought this syndrome is] due to the emergence of this disease [related] to toxic waste resulting from oil drilling operations carried out by Chinese companies there.

The newspaper reported the disease, which was said to have spread to villages close to a gas project in Somalia, turns the eyes of its victims yellow before causing them to overheat, swelling their bodies and ultimately [causing] their death. In addition to other symptoms, including yellowing of the palms, lack of appetite and insomnia, according to a report published by Al-Hurra, quoting the British newspaper, the report also included the denial [by] officials in Addis Ababa, published by the Guardian newspaper, [of] allegations of a health and environmental crisis in the region.

The Daily Mail said the cause of the disease is unclear, although many suspect it is the result of chemical waste having poisoned water supplies in the area. The newspaper quoted a former engineer with the Chinese company who claimed there have been regular spills of drilling fluids, including sulfuric acid, over the 3 years he worked at the site in Calop. [Regular spills? This sounds like a planned release of sulfuric acid. - Mod.TG]

Another said: "These people die from the raw toxins having been spilled as a result of utter negligence. The companies operating in Calop have abandoned their duty to protect the local population." At the same time, the newspaper indicated these chemical spills are historical, or may be caused by companies [of] Ethiopian transport.

For its part, said Kitsila Tadese, director of licenses at the Federal Ministry of Mines and Oil in Ethiopia, according to the Daily Mail, "All gas wells in Kalop and elsewhere in the Ogaden basin are closed, safe and secure...according to international standards."

Ethiopia, located in eastern Africa, had found large quantities of gas in the eastern Ogaden basin in the 1970s. POLY-GCL has been developing the Club and Hilal fields there since the signing of the production-sharing agreement with Ethiopia in 2013. Calub, southeast Jijiga, will start commercial gas production soon.

A mysterious and horrifying deadly illness killing villagers in Ethiopia could be the dreaded "Disease X". A concept coined by the World Health Organization (WHO) to describe a new unknown pathogen with the potential to cause an epidemic, scientists are constantly on the look-out for illnesses fitting the description. Some believe coronavirus is Disease X, but the real answer could lie in East Africa.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) leaves people bleeding from their eyes, mouth, and anus. [However, see commentary below. - Mod.TG]

The gruesome sickness, informally dubbed "bleeding eye fever", has a higher mortality rate than the plague and has mystified medical professionals for the past couple of years. Cases were reported in South Sudan and Uganda in 2018, with dozens infected and at least 4 killed.

Now neighbouring country Ethiopia is grappling with similar horrific symptoms. One 23 year old victim first experienced his eyes and palms turning yellow, before he began bleeding from his nose and mouth and his body swelled up, the Guardian reports. He later died after collapsing with fever. Many of his neighbours suffered the same symptoms, and some died. Other victims included a 2 year old boy in the town of Haarcad, who died despite receiving multiple blood transfusions during a month-long hospital stay. He, too, had yellow eyes and palms, swelling and a fever.

[Bleeding eye fever is also known as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). While the condition in Ethiopia may not be CCHF, it may just as likely be. "Transmission of CCHF to humans occurs through contact with infected ticks or animal blood. CCHF can be transmitted from one infected human to another by contact with infectious blood or body fluids. Documented spread of CCHF has also occurred in hospitals due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of injection needles, and contamination of medical supplies." (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/pdf/factsheet.pdf).

Especially in pastoral communities, animals may have the ticks and the disease, and the herders or caretakers may not realize it. In January 2018, Sputnik News reported on bleeding eye fever, which was then proven to be CCHF (https://sputniknews.com/africa/201801161060790324-bleeding-eye-fever-africa-proven to be CCHF).

The onset of CCHF is sudden, with initial signs and symptoms including headache, high fever, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain, and vomiting. Red eyes, a flushed face, a red throat, and petechiae (red spots) on the palate are common. Symptoms may also include jaundice, and in severe cases, changes in mood and sensory perception. As the illness progresses, large areas of severe bruising, severe nosebleeds, and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites can be seen, beginning on about the 4th day of illness and lasting for about 2 weeks. In documented outbreaks of CCHF, fatality rates in hospitalized patients have ranged from 9% to as high as 50%. The long-term effects of CCHF infection have not been studied well enough in survivors to determine whether or not specific complications exist. However, recovery is slow. (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/pdf/factsheet.pdf).

While it is possible for chemicals from many sources to cause liver damage and produce jaundice or a yellowing of skin and eyes, one generally has to come into contact with the chemicals, either by water contamination, or drinking contaminated water or perhaps bathing in it.

While at this point in time chemicals cannot be ruled out, neither can CCHF without some more research and/or testing.

When the liver is affected, by chemical or by disease, it is probable the individual will not feel like eating and likely could take on a yellowish hue. However, chemicals do not typically cause bleeding from the eyes unless the chemical in question is placed directly in the eye or the eye is exposed in an enclosed area, such as a room. - Mod.TG

Further information about these cases from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.SH
