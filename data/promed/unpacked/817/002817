Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 610 / 29 / 29 / 581 / 0
Affected population: one breeding sow, 26 fattening pigs and two suckling pigs.

Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Swine / 4.75 / 4.75 / 100 / 100

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments:
On [3 Sep 2018], fattening pigs were found dead and reported to Gifu Central Livestock Hygiene Service Centre (LHSC) by a veterinarian. On [8 Sep 2018], the samples derived from pigs of reported farm tested positive for Pestivirus by RT-PCR. But the result of pestivirus specific FAT was negative. On the same day, the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH) carried out CSFV specific RT-PCR and FAT to samples transported from Gifu City, and the result were positive and negative respectively. On [9 Sep 2018], sequencing analysis of the virus RNA was completed and the NIAH confirmed that this is the case of classical swine fever. Note: Possibility of a case of African swine fever was denied by NIAH. Movement and shipment restrictions are imposed on the hog farms within a radius of 3 km [approx 1.8 mi] and 3-10 km [1.8 to 6.2 mi] of the affected farm respectively. Stamping-out is being carried out on the affected farm.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; screening; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; stamping out; control of wildlife reservoirs; disinfection; ante and post-mortem inspections; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

[The following information comes from a special announcement by the University of Minnesota's Swine Health Information Center (SHIC) dated 9 Sep 2018. The complete document, that included a map, is available at https://www.swinehealth.org/special-announcement-csf-japan/

"The last CSF outbreak in Japan was in 1992 in Kumamoto Prefecture, and in 2007 the use of vaccination was banned, and disease eradication was declared in the country. The Japanese swine industry is still recovering from the 2013-2016 PED epidemic. On 9 Jul 2018, APHIS published the official notice of the OIE recognition of Japan as free of CSF. Currently Japan exports pork, and it is in the top-10 pork producing countries in the world.

"FAS/Tokyo estimates Japanese swine slaughter held stable at 16.336 million head in 2017.

"At this point, no other cases of CSF are suspected in Japan". - Mod.CRD
