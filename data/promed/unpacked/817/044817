HEALTH ALERT: Increase in Gastroenteritis Activity
-----------------------------------------------
Summary:
The Boston Public Health Commission's (BPHC) Syndromic Surveillance
System has shown an increase in gastroenteritis (GI) presentation in
emergency department visits. Gastroenteritis with fecal-oral
transmission has also been implicated in at least one institutional
outbreak in the city of Boston.
Epidemiology:
The Boston Public Health Commission's (BPHC) Syndromic Surveillance
System monitors hospital emergency department visits in the city of
Boston. Annual citywide outbreaks of gastroenteritis are typically
seen in the fall and winter months, often associated with presumptive
norovirus. Over the past 2 weeks, an increase in the number of
patients seeking treatment for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea has
been observed across all emergency departments in Boston.
[At this point, the Health Alert includes a chart showing a
progressive increase in Boston emergency department visits for GI
symptoms over the past 2 weeks from 50 on 2 Dec 2006 to 95 on 14 Dec
2006.]
BPHC is investigating reported clusters of gastroenteritis.
Gastroenteritis has been implicated in at least one outbreak in an
institutional setting. Early implementation of control measures,
including education on hand washing, increased availability of hand
sanitizer, and increased frequency of restroom cleaning, appears to
have decreased transmission in this setting.
Symptoms and Diagnosis:
Symptoms may differ depending on the causative organism; however,
viral gastroenteritis is often characterized by moderate to severe
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Symptoms usually
begin 1-2 days after exposure and last about 1-2 days in most people.
Most people recover without sequelae. Transmission is
person-to-person; virus is passed in stool and vomitus of infected
people from onset of illness until several days after symptoms
resolve.
Etiologic diagnosis of gastroenteritis is often not made because of
limited testing availability. In addition, laboratory testing may not
be requested because the illness tends to be of short duration.
Testing of clinical specimens in outbreak situations can be arranged
by contacting BPHC. BPHC can also arrange for inspection of
facilities with suspected involvement in transmission of infection.
Prevention:
Healthcare providers should emphasize hand hygiene using soap and
water or alcohol based hand sanitizers to prevent transmission of
infection. Ill persons should be advised to stay home until their
symptoms resolve and be reminded that they may still be contagious
for at least 3 days after symptoms subside. In addition, food
handlers should refrain from work for 72 hours after symptoms have
resolved. Increased frequency of cleaning in high traffic areas,
particularly restrooms, in institutional settings can also reduce the
potential for transmission.
Reporting:
City and State regulations require that healthcare providers report
any case of calicivirus (including norovirus) infection or food
poisoning diagnosed in Boston to BPHC. Any outbreak or cluster of
illnesses are also reportable. Laboratories in Boston must report the
result of any laboratory test positive for calicivirus to BPHC.
Reporting forms for health care providers and for laboratories are
available on the web at:
<http://www.bphc.org/cdc>.

Commission, Communicable Disease Control Division, at (617) 534-5611.

[Norovirus-associated viral gastroenteritis, also known as "winter
vomiting disease," is now prevalent throughout the northern
hemisphere. This Health Advisory provides useful advice for treatment
and containment of illness caused by noroviruses, the predominant
cause of sudden onset gastroenteritis. In view of the ubiquity of
norovirus infection during the winter months, reporting in
ProMED-mail will be restricted to large outbreaks of sickness or when
there is an association with specific or atypical situations.
There is no vaccine for control of norovirus infection nor any
specific treatment other than strict attention to cleanliness to
restrict person-to-person transmission of infection. Noroviruses
multiply prolifically in the human gut but cannot be propagated in
culture, which has thwarted efforts to develop vaccine.
The noroviruses, formerly designated only as "small round structured
viruses," are now classified as members of the genus _Norovirus_ in
the family _Caliciviridae_. They take their name from the town of
Norwalk, Ohio, where the association with disease was 1st
demonstrated in primary school children in the early 1970's. - Mod.CP]
