Enterovirus Infections Under Control: DOH
-----------------------------------------------
The current enterovirus outbreak, which has infected 50 children and
claimed 5 lives, has been brought under control, Department of Health
Minister Hou Sheng-mao said Saturday [4 Jun 2005] during an inspection tour
in the central city of Taichung. "Although the enterovirus infections are
at a peak, the general situation has been well-controlled," Hou said after
inspecting Taichung Veterans General Hospital to get a better understanding
of the outbreak in the central Taiwan area. An encouraging development was
that none of the enterovirus strains have mutated significantly, Hou said.
As the outbreak is expected to peak in 2 week's time, Hou urged medical
personnel and parents with young children to keep alert to prevent any
further spread of the disease. Noting that enteroviruses are transmitted
via direct contact with secretions from an infected person or contact with
contaminated surfaces or objects, Hou said practicing good personal hygiene
is critical to preventing infections.

[Hou Sheng-mao was quoted as saying that none of the enterovirus strains
(isolated from the patients) have mutated significantly. Generally
speaking, genetic mutation of a viral genome takes place all the time. And
it happens more readily in RNA viruses (such as EV71 in the family of
pciornaviridae) than in DNA viruses. However, in the context of the current
outbreak, what Hou meant regarding absence of significant mutation was not
elaborated, either by himself or by the media. What epidemiologists,
clinicians and public health authorities are most concerned about are
pathogenicity and/or severity of the disease prior to medication and drug
resistance of the causative agents responsible for the outbreak when
subjected for treatment. Since no unusual trend of the seasonal HFMD
epidemic was noted, it could be implicated in the aspect of anti-EV71 drug
resistance. Pyridyl imidazolidinone is a novel class of potent and
selective human enterovirus 71 inhibitors which target enterovirus 71
capsid protein VP1. Site-directed mutagenesis of enterovirus 71 infectious
cDNA revealed that a single amino acid alteration at the position 192 of
VP1 can confer resistance to the inhibitory effects of the antiviral drug
[see reference: Shin-Ru Shih et al. Mutation in Enterovirus 71 Capsid
Protein VP1 Confers Resistance to the Inhibitory Effects of Pyridyl
Imidazolidinone. Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, September 2004,
Vol. 48 (9):3523-3529]. Further information from the Department of Health,
Taiwan and colleagues familiar with HFMD and enteroviral infections are
welcome. - Mod.RY]
[The above newswire mentions there are 50 cases and 5 deaths currently
associated with this outbreak. In the earlier ProMED-mail report from 23
May 2005 (see references below) , there was mention of 29 cases and 3
deaths. Prediction that the outbreak will peak in 2 weeks time is a curious
prediction, and one suspects may be based on prior experiences with - Mod.MPP]
