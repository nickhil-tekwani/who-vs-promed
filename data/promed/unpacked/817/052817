I agree with Keith Osborn on most of the things he said, However, I believe
that is grossly understating a point of major impact, 'Oocysts are regularly
recovered during monitoring and yet illness in the community served is not
detected/reported.'
Many members of communities, even in our developed countries, are loath to
seek medical attention unless they are on death's doorstep. Sometimes this
is a financial reason, (such as lack of insurances) sometimes it is fear of
what they may find out. Consequently, that is one huge reason that it may
not be reported. Secondly, it has been my observation that in many
communities, particularly smaller ones, that some physicians are unaware of
the clinical signs and symptoms and seem to believe that if there is no
animal exposure, then there is not a risk, and the resulting clinical
situation is therefore some virus.
I believe that there is more clinical illness from this "emerging" disease
than is being reported/recognized and I think it is a point that needs to
examined more closely. In so doing, it is likely that there would be a
higher rate of infection found. Furthermore, in some cases cities are
reluctant to report that their drinking water may be at fault. After all,
that type of admission causes the public to question its safety and the
responsibility of the city officials, has potentials to decrease tourism, or
other economic impacts, such as companies no longer wishing to locate into
that community. Consequently, crypto is probably more of a problem than is
clearly evident.

<Do I detect a little of the reluctance of the veterinary community's
reluctance to acknowledge the importance of animal (domestic or wild) faeces
as a major source of Cryptosporidium oocysts?
Although many waterborne outbreaks have involved treatment process problems,
significant deterioration of source water quality is also a frequent factor.
At the levels used in drinking water treatment, oocysts are to all intents
and purposes insensitive to chlorine disinfection, which is of course why
crypto is of such concern to the drinking water community.>>
The comment of Keith Osborn is very pertinent. In the UK we have recently
had a Crypto. outbreak apparently from a aquifer sourced water supply in the
general North London area. To much surprise.
A few months later Thames Water had an advertising campaign about their
"breakthrough" in supplementing aquifer water sources (probably the same
aquifer) with spare river water. Was I the only one to see the link? Or the
only one to keep quiet?
It would be interesting to see what Thames and the affected water company
think about this.
