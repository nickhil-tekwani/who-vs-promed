Angola: Technicians from Health Ministry and WHO travel to Uije
---------------------------------------------------
A team comprising 12 technicians of the Health Ministry and the World
Health Organisation (WHO) left today for the northern Uije province,
to give sanitary assistance to the population of that region,
following the spread of a disease caused by Marburg virus.
Speaking to Angop [Angola Press News Agency], the information
assistant of the National Direction of Public Health, Filomena
Wilson, said that the team will for a week work to reinforce the
epidemiological alert in the province, since it is a lethal and
contagious disease. "We are ready to take measures that are aimed to
fight mortality, disinfect the hospital and other infected areas,
[and] take medicine and hospital protection materials for the
province", she said.
The health team is taking to Uije some essential medicine for first
aid such as serum [blood products?] and antibiotics, products for
[disinfection and cleaning, such as hypochlorite of sodium].
The WHO specialists in the team are a Kenyan and a Congolese, as well
as a researcher from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta (USA). Filomena Wilson also stated that, besides the
permanent working groups, there will be frequent visits to Uije, so
long as the current situation persists.
The agent that caused the epidemics, which according to official data
is behind the death of 96 people since last February, in Uije
Province, is [the filovirus -- Marburg virus], as confirmed by 9 of
the 12 samples sent to the CDC for analysis.
Marburg disease is a viral [hemorrhagic fever caused by Marburg
virus, a member of the family _Filoviridae_ of negative-stranded RNA
viruses. The infection is thought to originate by transmission from
the African green monkey. Infection is contracted] through contact
with animals, infected human beings or through semen during
unprotected sex, as well as through handling body fluids. Strong
headaches and muscle pains and fever, vomiting, diarrhea, among
others, are the 1st symptoms of the disease; after 7 days patients
can present with hemorrhage through vomitus, through the vagina,
skin, and eyes.

[The final paragraph of the first report is an edited version of the
original which contained a number of incorrect statements. It is
apparent that the local health-care authorities are still unfamiliar
with the true nature of Marburg hemorrhagic fever. For a more
accurate description of Marburg hemorrhagic fever, readers should
refer to previous posts in this thread. - Mod.CP]
