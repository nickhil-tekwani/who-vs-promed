Anthrax has been diagnosed in an inhabitant of the Tunkinsky district
in Buryatia. The affected person, who has been hospitalised,
participated at the end of August [2007] in the slaughter of cow
which, apparently, was infected by anthrax.
The directorate of the Ministry of extreme situations in the Republic
of Buryatia informed that quarantine measures have been applied in
the affected district. This includes disinfection check-points on the
Federal highway Ulan-Ude - Mondy, where vehicles undergo sanitary procedures.
A total of 500 doses of a human anthrax vaccine and 10 000 doses of
animal vaccine have been delivered in the district. The villages
Kyren and Khuzhyr are considered to be in a high risk area, but so
far no symptoms of disease have been recorded in animals. More than
130 persons from the high risk area, or those who might have been
exposed to the slaughtered sick animal, have been contacted,
medically checked and found healthy.

On 29 Aug 2007 a sick animal was slaughtered in Kyren village, in the
Tunkinskoyo [Tunkinsky] district, without the presence of a
veterinarian. A total of 5 people attended the slaughter.
To confirm the suitability of the meat, the owner sent biological
material (liver, heart) to be examined in the [local?] Veterinary
Laboratory, which tentatively suspected anthrax ["Siberian ulcer"].
On 31 Aug 2007 material was sent for confirmation to the RMT
"Republican veterinary laboratory for science and production," which
confirmed anthrax.
All 18 people which were in contact with the sick animal and the
contaminated meat were placed under medical observation. According to
preliminary data, the background to the case and to exposure of
persons who are not animal owners, is the lack of [cattle] vaccination.
According to available information, there are 25 locations in the
Tunkinsky district where anthrax had been recorded in the past [thus
areas where animals should be permanently be vaccinated and
revaccinated, for many years. - Mod.AS].
The authorities urge the public to purchase meat and meat products
only from recognised, veterinary-controlled sources and to avoid any
purchase from unknown persons.
