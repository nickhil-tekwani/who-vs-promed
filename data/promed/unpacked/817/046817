Cat owners in the Bendigo area are urged to keep an eye out for signs of a potentially fatal illness having struck at least one cat in the city.

Bendigo Animal Hospital veterinarian Dr Max Tori said a cat from Kennington suffering feline panleukopenia virus, also known as feline parvovirus, was brought into the clinic on Monday [12 Mar 2018].

Fortunately, the owners of the Kennington cat picked up on their pet's illness quickly, and the cat was responding well to treatment, but Dr Tori said FPV could rapidly become fatal.

Dr Tori said common signs included lethargy, vomiting, and diarrhea, which could be bloody. He said the illness came on quickly, and owners should visit a vet if their pet displayed any signs.

Unvaccinated cats should be kept indoors until they are vaccinated. Owners should ensure their cats receive the standard annual vaccination, which provides high protection against FPV.

Dr Tori said it was the 1st case of the illness he had seen in Bendigo since arriving at the clinic 5 years ago, and its incidence was low Australia-wide.

But earlier this year [2018], RSPCA Victoria and the Victorian division of the Australian Veterinary Association issued advice after the virus was detected in stray kittens in Melbourne.

Dr Tori said feral cats and people failing to vaccinate their pets had likely contributed to the re-emergence of the illness. He said he believed some people were lax about vaccinating their cats because while many pet owners were well aware of canine parvovirus, the dangers of this virus were not as well-known.

[This virus very definitely is making a comeback in Australia. Owners should be sure their animal or animals are vaccinated. This disease can become deadly very quickly.
