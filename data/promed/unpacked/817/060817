-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Pea necrotic yellow dwarf virus_ (PNYDV) was identified in green peas (_Pisum sativum_) in Germany in 2009 [and detected] in Austria in 2010.

A countrywide outbreak of virus-like disease symptoms on faba beans (_Vicia faba_) was reported in Germany in 2016. Many fields had large patches of yellowish and dwarfed plants. More than 460 samples of _P. sativum_ and _V. faba_ showing virus-like symptoms were analysed. 54.7 per cent tested positive with an ELISA for broad detection of nanoviruses. The same samples did not react with an ELISA designed to detect only _Faba bean necrotic stunt virus_ and _Faba bean necrotic yellows virus_, indicating infection with PNYDV.

Using PNYDV-specific PCR targeting a coat protein component, PNYDV infection was confirmed for a subset of 18 samples. Sequencing showed 98.7 to 99.9 per cent nucleotide identity with PNYDV. 3 lentil (_Lens culinaris_) samples from a field trial in central Germany also tested positive for PNYDV with confirmation by PCR and sequencing.

In Austria, nanovirus symptoms appeared first in _P. sativum_ and shortly after in faba bean. In mid-late June [2016], nearly every _V. faba_ crop showed typical symptoms. In many crops infection caused significant yield losses. Stunted growth, chlorosis and poorly developed pods were also found in lentils and vetch (_V. sativa_). 32 samples of _L. culinaris_, _P. sativum_, _V. faba_ and _V. sativa_ from Burgenland, Styria, Upper and Lower Austria were tested for nanovirus using PCR. The samples consisted of leaves pooled from several symptomatic plants from each field. 27 samples were positive for nanovirus. Representative amplicons from faba beans, lentils, peas and vetch had 99.6 to 100 per cent identity to PNYDV.

This is the first report of _L. culinaris_, _V. faba_ and _V. sativa_ as natural hosts of PNYDV in Austria and Germany. The area of legumes grown in Germany doubled from 2012 to 2015 with further increases expected. However, limited experiments on peas and faba beans have not identified PNYDV-resistant accessions in Austria or Germany suggesting that legume production in central Europe is threatened by PNYDV.

[_Pea necrotic yellow dwarf virus_ (PNYDV; genus _Nanovirus_) was identified in commercially grown peas in Germany. Molecular characterisation established it as a new species (see link below). Subsequently, it was also found in peas in Austria and other central European areas. PNYDV symptoms on pea include leaf rolling, chlorosis and stunting of plants.

So far, only 8 species of nanoviruses are known. Nanoviruses have frequently overlapping, but fairly narrow host ranges. Between them they can affect over 50 wild and cultivated legume species, as well as a few non-legumes. Crop losses had previously mainly been reported from the Middle East and North Africa on chickpeas and lentils. The virus species are transmitted by a number of aphid vectors. Leguminous weeds or inter-seasonal cover crops may serve as reservoir hosts for infection of the main crops. Disease management is difficult and may include vector control, removal of inoculum (infected plants), phytosanitation and frequent monitoring for new outbreaks.

The identification of additional crops as hosts for PNYDV reported above will be an important consideration when designing management strategies for legume viruses. Breeding programmes for crop varieties with reduced PNYDV sensitivity suitable to the region will be essential.

Nanoviruses belong to the family Nanoviridae which also includes _Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV; genus _Babuvirus_; see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives) and _Coconut foliar decay virus_ (CFDV; unassigned to genus), both of which can seriously impact cultivation of the respective crops.
