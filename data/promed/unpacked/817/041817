Recently, 3 members of the typhus group of rickettsioses have been reported
in Mexico.
The mean incidence of epidemic typhus (infection by _Rickettsia
prowazekii_) during 1959 to 1961 was 146 cases per year. 23 cases
were reported in 1968, and 102 in 1983.
_Rickettsia felis_ infection is clinically similar to endemic typhus. Human
infections and carriage by fleas have been documented in the Yucatan, where
as many as 5 percent of healthy persons are seropositive (1999). 20
percent of _Ctenocephalides felis_ in the Yucatan are infested, and
infected fleas have been recovered from flying squirrels in the region.
In recent years, endemic typhus (_Rickettsia typhi_) rates of approximately
0.06/100 000 have been recorded. 14 percent to 17 percent of blood donors
in Mexico City are seropositive. Cases are described in Guerrero, Hidalgo,
Jalisco, Mexico, Michoacan, Nayarit, Nuevo Leon, Oaxaca, Puebla, Queretaro,
Tamaulipas, and Zacatecas States.
