The central government will take charge of nationwide decontamination
efforts to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth animal disease [FMD],
which has hit 3 provinces since early April 2010, government
officials said Monday [3 May 2010].

The Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said the
government will expand a 13-person task force chaired by the farm
minister to include officials from public administration, defense
ministries and the police for closer cooperation.

Closer inter-governmental ties are needed as over 8000 soldiers and
police are employed to help the animal quarantine effort, they said,
adding that Seoul will directly cross-check efforts to contain the
spread of the disease.

"Instead of just concentrating on areas hit, which was the case in
the past, the central government will directly start checking all
provinces across the country, including Jeju Island, to deal with the
latest outbreaks," Park Hyun-chool, assistant minister in charge of
food safety said. [Jeju Island is a southern, "Special self-governing
province" of S. Korea; map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jeju_SK.png>].

The country has effectively been on the highest alert, but the
disease has spread from the Gyeonggi region to North and South
Chungcheong provinces. A total of 49 130 animals have been culled and
buried so far with damages estimated to hit around 160 billion won
(USD 143.7 million), not counting around 100 billion won worth of
soft loans to buy new animals that will be given to farmers after the
outbreak is contained.

At present, local administrations have been charged with checking the
spread of the disease, but the recent outbreak at a state-managed
livestock and veterinary research institute in South Chungcheong
Province has raised concerns about the government's quarantine
system. The province accounts for 18 percent of all cloven-hoofed
animals raised in the country.

"The central government will check decontamination efforts on a
regular basis and press for more stringent countermeasures," the
official said.

He added that Seoul will check how well local administrations respond
to the current crisis situation and give incentives like more
subsidies in the future, as well as penalize those who do not follow
guidelines.

"Overall, the government plans to re-check the entire standard
operating procedure for combating the disease," he said.

Park added that while the exact cause has not been determined, tests
conducted on the virus in the Chungcheong region in the central part
of the country are similar to those on Ganghwa Island, about 60 km
west of Seoul, where the 1st case was reported on 8 Apr 2010. He said
as a precautionary measure, some breeding cows raised at a special
state-run research center in Seosan, 151 km from the capital city,
will be sent to 2 other locations. The research facility raises
"hanwoo" beef cattle and provides animal husbandry services.

FMD affects all cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle, hogs, deer,
goats and buffalo. Countries that report the disease are barred from
exporting meat from cloven-hoofed animals.

South Korea has confirmed a total of 10 cases of FMD from April 2010.

The ministry, meanwhile, said that it has engaged in talks with
Japan, which reported 16 [this has, in the meantime, become 17] cases
of the disease in Miyazaki Prefecture in the past few weeks, to
determine what concerted efforts the 2 countries can take in the
future.

Japan culled or plans to cull 9000 animals to control the disease.

"Because both South Korea and Japan are close to countries that
suffer from outbreaks on a regular basis, there is a need to work
together to see what countermeasures can be taken," another farm
ministry official said.

[South Korea has sent the OIE 2 follow-up reports on Mon 3 May 2010:
a follow-up report No 3 addressing the 8th affected farm (pigs) in
offshore Ganghwa, where the epizootic started, reportedly on 8 Apr
2010 (see, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9126>),
and a follow-up report No 1, addressing the 2nd affected mainland
(mixed) farm, where pigs have been found infected. The 1st outbreak
on the mainland started, reportedly, on 21 Apr 2010. This report is
available, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9166>.
It includes the following epidemiological comment: "A worker in the
Institute of Livestock and Sanitation Research of Ch'ungch'ong-Namdo
found a suspicious case which had vesicles in nose and foot and
reported it to the local government on 30 Apr 2010. The NVRQS
affirmed the pig was infected with FMD virus by PCR and ELISA on 1
May 2010. Not only all cloven-hoofed animals in the affected farm but
also all cloven-hoofed animals within a radius of 500 meters from the
affected institute were culled."

The virus responsible for the outbreak in S. Korea (offshore and
mainland) is FMDV serotype O, topotype SEA (South East Asia),
genotype/strain Mya-98. This virus has been identified by the WRLFMD
at Pirbright as practically identical to the recent isolates from
Hong Kong, most probably representing the strain circulating
throughout at least 7 of China's provinces. No genotyping is as yet
available of the Japanese isolate, but a different virus will be a
surprise. - Mod.AS]
