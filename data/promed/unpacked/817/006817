Aventis Pasteur withdraws VAQTA hepatitis A vaccines
----------------------------------------------------
A coordinated withdrawal of the VAQTA hepatitis A vaccines manufactured by
Aventis Pasteur took place throughout member states of the European Union
(EU) last week. The withdrawal applies to both adult and paediatric
preparations (launched in 1997 and 1998, respectively) and to all batches
of vaccine currently within their expiry date. Previous batches that have
now expired (including those marketed under their generic name, "Hepatitis
A vaccine, purified, inactivated, for adults") may also have been affected.

Those holding stocks of vaccine are requested to quarantine all affected
batches. Aventis Pasteur MSD is contacting customers to arrange return of
unused doses. For medical queries contact Aventis Pasteur MSD's Vaccine
Information Service.

The antigen content in some prefilled syringes was found to be below the
established minimum specification on retesting of a sample of vaccine doses
in Germany. It is therefore possible that some patients who have received
any of the formulations of VAQTA may be inadequately protected against
infection with hepatitis A virus or have reduced duration of protective
immunity, or both. The problem with vaccine potency seems to be sporadic,
possibly related to the filling process, which means that it is not
possible to predict which recipients might be inadequately protected.
People who have received VAQTA products can be reassured that the vaccine
is not being recalled for reasons of safety.

No major threat to public health is anticipated, since most hepatitis A
vaccinations are given for short-term low-risk exposures during travel
abroad. Hepatitis A virus transmission has been effectively reduced by the
high level of hygiene and sanitation in most member states of the EU, and
vaccination has made a very small contribution to its epidemiology in most
countries (1).

People who have received VAQTA in the past and require ongoing protection
can be revaccinated with an alternative brand of vaccine or tested for
serological evidence of immunity. The response from public health
authorities to the VAQTA withdrawal has varied in different countries. In
the UK, the Department of Health has made recommendations (2) that apply
only to those at continuing risk of hepatitis A who have been immunised
with VAQTA products. It is recommended that:

- those who have previously been immunised with these products should start
their immunisation schedule again with another hepatitis A vaccine product;
- those who have been immunised with one of these products in anticipation
of travelling to high-risk areas for hepatitis A in the near future, for
example for a 'winter sun' holiday, should be reimmunised immediately, with
another product. Hepatitis A vaccine is effective prevention even if given
immediately before departure (3); and
- those who have received both a VAQTA product and another hepatitis A
vaccine product as part of their immunisation should, for continuing
protection, receive a further dose of another hepatitis A vaccine product.
A period of at least 6 months should have elapsed between the 2 doses of
the alternative vaccines (4).

Implementing these recommendations may be particularly difficult in certain
hard-to-reach high-risk groups who are at ongoing risk, such as injecting
drug users (1). No vaccine failures have been reported to the regulatory
authorities in EU countries. Surveillance data from the Public Health
Laboratory Service (PHLS) for England and Wales include very limited
information on vaccination status, but 3 cases of hepatitis A virus
infection have been reported in previously vaccinated people in England and
Wales, one in 1997 and 2 in 1998. No outbreaks have been reported in
England and Wales that could be traced to failure of vaccine. On the basis
of the information that has been made available, most recipients of VAQTA
are likely to have adequate antibody levels. If on revaccination, a local
reaction occurs, this should be reported in the usual way to the relevant
authorities.
