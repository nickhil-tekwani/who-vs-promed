Farm duck positive for H5N1 bird flu in Germany
-----------------------------------------------
Authorities say a duck at a farm in eastern Germany has tested
positive for the H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus.

The social affairs ministry in the eastern state of Saxony says the
farm near Goerlitz on the Polish border has been sealed off. The
ministry said Thursday [9 Oct 2008] that the farm has more than 1000
birds, including turkeys and geese.

Germany has seen several cases of bird flu in the past, most recently
in December [2007].

The disease has ravaged poultry stocks in Asia, and scientists
believe it spread to both Europe and Africa with migratory wild birds.

Though bird flu is difficult for people to catch, the H5N1 strain has
killed at least 206 people worldwide.

Bird flu returns to Germany
---------------------------
Bird flu has returned to Germany, with the H5N1 influenza virus
breaking out among farm ducks in the eastern state of Saxony,
officials said Thursday [9 Oct 2008].

It was the 1st proven appearance of the disease this year [2008] in
Germany. Officials said they had sealed off the farm and planned to
slaughter the whole flock of ducks at Goerlitz, near the Polish
border. The property contains more than 1000 birds, mainly turkeys and geese.

Germany's national animal health laboratory on the Baltic island of
Riems said the find was "somewhat surprising" as the infection alert
had been reduced to moderate after an outbreak was beaten last
December [2007]. Then, officials launched the largest-ever bird cull
in Germany, exterminating a massive 160 000 geese over a weekend in
Wachenroth, Bavaria.

It remained unknown what proportion of wild birds in Germany were
infected, a spokeswoman said.

None of Germany's neighbours are currently reporting any H5N1
detections, with the virus having recently shown up in Asia, from
which scientists believe it had earlier spread to both Europe and
Africa with migratory wild birds.

[According to additional information, published on 10 Oct 2008 by the
Saxony Radio Station MDR (for which we are grateful to Sabine
Zentis), the affected holding is a breeding unit with approx 1100
ducks. Turkeys, geese, and chickens are kept on this unit as well. A
total of about 1400 birds were to be culled on Friday [10 Oct 2008].
The Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI) is investigating samples to
establish whether the H5N1 strain is highly pathogenic. Final results
should be available today (10 Oct 2008). - Mod.AS
