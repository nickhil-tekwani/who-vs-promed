Following a suspected cholera outbreak in Kigorobya Sub-county, Hoima district, 3 people have been confirmed dead while 16 others are hospitalized. The District Health Inspector, Fred Byenumi, told New Vision on Tuesday evening [16 Apr 2013], that the suspected outbreak has been reported in Kapaapi and Kibiro parishes along Lake Albert shores.

"But we are yet to confirm if it is cholera we are taking samples to the national research center in Entebbe to ascertain if it is the one but according to the symptoms it seem to be cholera, once we confirm we shall declare to you," Byenumi explained. He said as part of interventions they have opened a cholera treatment center at Runga landing site in Kigorobya Sub County that will also handle all emerging cases.

He said the disease that was first reported in the area on Thu 11 Apr 2013, is suspected to have spread from Nebbi and Arua the neighboring districts due to the usual interaction between the 2 neighboring areas people that trade along Lake Albert shoreline.

James Mugenyi Mulindambura, the area district Councilor blamed the spread on poor sanitation standards in the area. He has said the government should have a deliberate program to improve sanitation in the area.

"We have sensitized the people about latrine construction and usage since most of them do not have them (latrines) but they seem can't manage to have proper sanitary facilities which are expensive and out of reach for most of these people given the nature of soils," he said.

Meanwhile, every year at the onset of the rainy season there are reported cholera outbreaks in the same sub county. In 2012, the deadly disease claimed the lives of 12 people and more than 600 were hospitalized in the same sub county.

[3] Cholera - India (Gujarat)

A class-II student of Asarwa [a colony in Ahmedabad] Hindi School No 9, died of diarrhea at her home on Sun [7 Apr 2013]. In all, 32 children studying in the municipal primary schools located in the same building as the deceased's school are also ill with diarrhoea and vomiting since Sat [6 Apr 2013]. Of these, 9 kids had to be hospitalised when their condition began to deteriorate. It is suspected that the children had fallen ill after consuming impure drinking water at their school.

It is not known whether the student died of cholera but the medical report of the one of the 6 children admitted in civil hospital has confirmed that she is suffering from the dreaded water-borne disease. This has given rise to suspicion that cholera could have caused the death as well.

Another 31 children, who live in different areas of Asarwa, also complained of vomiting and diarrhea. Of the 8 children admitted in hospital, 6 are in civil hospital while 2 others are in private establishments. Sources said that the condition of some of them had deteriorated.

"Both expired at the hospital," according to Maguindanao health chief Dr Tahir Sulaik. Sinolinding said water with human and animal wastes contaminated the sources of drinking water of the more than 1800 residents of [the smallest administrative division in the Philippines] Toka Marror.

According to the Cotabato Regional and Medical Center here where all the patients were confined, they have recorded 68 admitted patients, 51 of whom were children.
