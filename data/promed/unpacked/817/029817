An anthrax epidemic has been declared in Gowa, South Sulawesi, with cows in
3 villages infected with the deadly illness and fears that infected meat
has been sold to the public, an official says. No people in the region have
been reported sick with the disease.
Bategulung village secretary Abdul Hamid said 3 cows in the village had
been confirmed infected with anthrax during the past week. Two possibly
infected cows had been slaughtered before the disease was detected and
their meat sold to the public, he said. Abdul Hamid said the administration
had issued a circular informing people not to sell or slaughter cattle
until the beasts had been inspected and cleared by the local health office.
Villagers in 3 areas had alerted the authorities after their cattle died of
suspicious symptoms, he said. Farmer Lawonri Daeng Tulung, who owned one of
the infected beasts, said he was not initially aware his cow was sick. "I
took the cow to pasture. An hour later, however, I was informed by my
neighbors that my cow had died," he said. Lawonri informed his village
head, who later contacted the Gowa Livestock Husbandry Office and Maros
Veterinary Agency. An organ sample was later taken from the cow for
laboratory tests. Samples were also taken from 96 other cows in the location.
Maros Veterinary Agency head Roni Mudidgo confirmed anthrax bacteria had
been found in an organ sample taken from one of the cattle. Roni said an
anthrax epidemic had been declared in the Gowa regency after 2 infections
were confirmed there earlier. "Local people have to beware," he said. He
urged the Gowa regency to carry out mass vaccinations of all livestock in
the area to prevent the disease from spreading.

["Villagers in 3 areas had alerted the authorities after their cattle died
.." and "Samples were also taken from 96 other cows" are obvious
indications that the circumstances are worse than just the 3 cows dying in
Gowa. Also taking an "organ" sample indicates that Lawonri's cow was
necropsied and thus there would have been the opportunity for soil
contamination. With repeated outbreaks in Sulawesi, the island is clearly
overdue to have compulsory annual vaccination. - Mod.MHJ]
