Assam is in deep grip of the killer Japanese encephalitis where the [death] toll has gone up to 20. That too in Sivasagar district alone. Over 100 people from the district have been under going treatment in the various hospital. According to reports, cases of acute encephalitis syndrome [AES} are on the rise. The number has shot up to 332 till Saturday. The death toll has touched 50.

The worst-hit districts are Kamrup, Sivasagar, Dhubri, Morigaon, Darrang and Nalbari. Doctors blame it all on the halt in fogging due to the floods and rain. They said that during monsoons, people are more prone to diseases. Government efforts are on to keep the situation under control. Although vaccination is said to be an effective way to deal with this menace, the next vaccination programme is not known.

[There was a significant outbreak of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections, with deaths, last year (2011). In that year, there were 351 cases and 89 deaths due to JEV infection reported in Assam up to 9 Aug 2011 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110824.2582). The etiologies of all of the current cases, above, are not clearly indicated. Some are reported as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections, and failure to carry out mosquito vector control by fogging is blamed for the cases. Vaccination, presumably for JEV, is mentioned as well. However, the total number of AES cases and deaths is more than that reported for JEV infections. As in the situation in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states, the etiologies of the AES cases are not given. The most recent report from Bihar state ruled out JEV as involved in their encephalitis cases.

Ronan Kelly is thanked for sending in this report.
