Since 20 Feb 2018 there have been 2 horse quarantines in Alachua County due to the illness known as "strangles". And the disease is causing some concern for participants in upcoming horse shows.

Strangles acts very similarly like the flu does for people, but it's a horse specific bacterial infection. Dr Erica Lacher is an equine veterinarian and she explained, "It was once called strangles because it could cause horses to strangle, but with the invention of antibiotics it's much easier to treat than it used to be." Dr Lacher went on to say, "We don't have that happen so much anymore but potentially if they're not treated it could happen but usually they just get these big abscesses around their throat. The 1st thing you see though is horses draining a lot of snot."

Strangles most commonly comes from situations where horses are in extremely close conditions to each other, like kill pens. Dr Lacher said, "Those are horses that are destine for slaughter in Mexico or Canada unscrupulous buyers pull them out of those sales and sell them to unsuspecting people."

For anyone taking their horse to upcoming shows Dr Lacher says try to avoid nose to nose contact with unknown horses and only let them eat and drink the food and water when you know where it came from. Dr Lacher advised, "You want to have your buckets for your horse to drink out of, not a community water trough. "Horse owners we spoke with didn't seem too worried about the sickness saying there's plenty of worse problems a horse can get which are harder to treat."

[The ability for this disease to spread so rapidly, may be why it has been added to the reportable disease list.

_Streptococcus equi equi_ is highly contagious and produces high morbidity and low mortality in susceptible populations. Transmission occurs via fomites and direct contact with infectious exudates. Carrier animals are important for maintenance of the bacteria between epizootics and initiation of outbreaks on premises previously free of disease. Survival of the organism in the environment is dependent on temperature and humidity; it is susceptible to desiccation, extreme heat, and exposure to sunlight, and must be protected within mucoid secretions to survive. Under ideal environmental circumstances, the organism can survive 7-9 weeks outside the host. Paddocks and barn facilities used by infected horses should be regarded as contaminated for about 2 months after resolution of an outbreak.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days and the 1st sign of infection is fever (103-106 deg F/39.4-41.1 deg C). Within 24-48 hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge, depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy.
