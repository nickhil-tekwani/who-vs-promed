A woman from southern Bristol County has been diagnosed with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) confirmed on Sunday [25 Aug 2019]. The woman is the 4th confirmed case of EEE in Massachusetts this summer.

Friends and family of [LS], a Fairhaven woman, said she was treated at Tuft's Medical Center but died of EEE. The DPH has not confirmed the woman's identity. A post on the Teamsters Local 59 Facebook page said [LS] was the wife of [RS Jr.], the Teamsters President.

On Friday [23 Aug 2019], a 3rd human case of EEE was announced. A man older than 60 contracted the disease in northern Franklin County.

EEE symptoms can range from a stiff neck, headache, and lack of energy to dangerous complications like inflammation and swelling of the brain.

The risk of EEE will remain until the 1st killing frost. Aerial spraying was scheduled for Worcester and Middlesex counties this weekend in hopes of lowering the risk of EEE.

[This summer EEE virus transmission season (2019) has been an active one, with now an increase to 4 human cases. As the report above indicates, the risk of human and equine cases will continue for about another 6 weeks until the 1st killing frosts of 28 deg F (-2 deg C) end mosquito activity. The US National Weather Service indicates that, on average, the 1st killing frost occurs in late October in northern Massachusetts.

There is a vaccine available for equine animals, and their owners are wise to have them vaccinated. There is no commercially available vaccine for humans, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the best preventive measure. A "fight the bite" campaign would be an effective way to educate the public to avoid mosquito exposure.

Additional information on EEE is available on the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/. - Mod.TY
