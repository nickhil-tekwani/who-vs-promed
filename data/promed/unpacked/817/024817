MOH is still considering all preventive and precautionary procedures in dealing with MERS-CoV, through the ministry Command & Control Center
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As part of the policy of transparency that is adopted by the Ministry of Health, and its systematic infections monitoring, we are announcing the registration of sporadic cases of MERS-CoV around the kingdom, the latest of which was in Taif.

In addition to monitoring, to protect the community's health, the ministry also reminded people to take all preventive and precautionary procedures in dealing with the virus, through the Command & Control Center.

To avoid becoming infected, the ministry also stressed the importance of practices such as washing hands frequently, avoiding contact with patients, avoiding the touching of eyes or noses, using tissues to cover mouths when coughing, avoiding contact with camels that are demonstrating symptoms, and additional general health practices.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Saudi Arabia
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia (SAU) has reported additional laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to WHO.

Epidemiological update
----------------------
Between [29 Sep 2014 and 11 Oct 2014], 7 additional cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported, including 1 death, with details as follows:
- A 69-year-old male from Taif City who developed symptoms on [17 Sep 2014]. The patient has co-morbidities and his possible contact with animals and consumption of raw camel products is currently under investigation. [reported on 6 Oct 2014 - Mod.MPP]
- A 65-year-old male from Jubail City who developed symptoms on [24 Sep 2014]. The patient has co-morbidities, frequent contact with camels and frequently consumes raw camel milk. [reported as having died on 9 Oct 2014 - Mod.MPP]
- A 70-year-old male from Alhenakiah City who developed symptoms on [24 Sep 2014]. The patient has co-morbidities, frequent contact with camels and frequently consumes raw camel milk. [reported as recovered on 8 Oct 2014 - Mod.MPP]
- A 60-year-old male from Geiya city [reported by Taif - Mod.MPP] who developed symptoms on [1 Oct 2014]. The patient has co-morbidities, frequent contact with camels and frequently consumes raw camel milk. [reported on 4 Oct 2014 - Mod.MPP]
- A 51-year-old male from Haradh City [reported by Hafoof - Mod.MPP] who developed symptoms on [30 Sep 2014]. The case died on [5 Oct 2014]. The patient had co-morbidities, frequent contact with camels and frequently consumed raw camel milk. [reported on 7 Oct 2014 - Mod.MPP]
- A 77-year-old male from Taif City who developed symptoms on [3 Oct 2014]. The patient has co-morbidities and became infected while hospitalized. [reported on 7 Oct 2014 - Mod.MPP]
- A 50-year-old non-national male from Najran City who developed symptoms on [3 Oct 2014]. He reported no history of contact with animals, but resides in an area with heavy presence of camel farms. [reported on 11 Oct 2014 - Mod.MPP]

The tracing of household contacts is ongoing for these cases.

In addition, the deaths of 4 previously reported MERS-CoV cases from Saudi Arabia were also reported.

Cases identified in SAU following a retrospective review
--------------------------------------------------------
Following a retrospective review of laboratory records in non-Ministry of Health hospitals, the National IHR Focal Point of SAU has also reported 19 additional cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 11 deaths. Of the additional cases, 1 occurred in August 2013, 2 occurred in March 2014, 10 occurred in April 2014 and 6 occurred in May 2014.

Of the additional cases reported by SAU, 79 percent (15 people) are Saudi nationals. 16 of the reported cases resided in Jeddah, 2 in Kharj and 1 in Dhahran. The median age is 56 years (ranging from 27 to 89), 68 percent (13/19) were men, and 11 percent (2/19) of the reported cases were health care workers.

The retrospective identification of these 19 cases does not alter the pattern and dynamic of the epidemic and the global risk assessment remains unchanged.

In addition, SAU notified WHO of 1 false positive case reported in a cohort of cases that occurred between [11 Apr 2014 and 9 Jun 2014]. SAU also reported that 1 case had been reported twice and was therefore a duplicate case.

Globally, 877 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 317 related deaths have been reported to WHO. The total case count removes the false positive case and the duplicate case reported above.

WHO advice
----------
With the annual pilgrimage of Hajj recently taking place, WHO encourages Member States to review WHO's travel advice on MERS-CoV for pilgrimages, published in June 2014 [http://www.who.int/ith/updates/20140603/en/].

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating.

General hygiene measures such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[To summarize the above report, as of 11 Oct 2014, a total of 877 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including "at least" 317 deaths (case fatality rate 36.1 percent) have been reported to WHO worldwide. If one adds the newly confirmed cases and deaths reported by the Saudi MOH since 11 Oct 2014, during which period there have been 5 additional laboratory-confirmed cases including one additional death reported by Saudi Arabia, and the one case reported by Qatar that had a history of travel to Saudi Arabia, this would bring the global tally of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to 883 including at least 318 deaths, using the WHO baseline of global reports. That being said, according to the Saudi MOH website, as of today, 16 Oct 2014, since June 2012 there have been a total of 765 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 325 deaths.

With today's report of 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection (including one death), both in Taif, this now brings the total number of cases reported in Taif since the beginning of September 2014 to 11 including 5 deaths (case fatality rate 45.5 percent) of whom 3 (27.3 percent) had a history of exposure to camels, 3 were in healthcare workers (27.3 percent), and the remaining 5 cases (45.5 percent) did not have a history of animal exposure, but all had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities which may have led to healthcare exposure -- such as mentioned in the above WHO report -- the 77-year-old male from Taif city with onset of symptoms on 3 Oct 2014 and reported by the Saudi MOH on 7 Oct 2014 who was infected while hospitalized.

Noteworthy in the above WHO report is that of the 7 newly confirmed cases, 4 (57.1 percent) were mentioned to "have frequent contact with camels and frequently consumed raw camel milk", 1 (14.3 percent) lives "in an area with heavy presence of camel farms", and 1 (14.3 percent) case's "possible contact with animals and consumption of raw camel products is currently under investigation" and 1 (14.3 percent) "became infected while hospitalized". Hence, it appears as though the majority of these newly confirmed sporadic cases have probable identifiable risk factors for exposure -- primarily contact with camels and camels milk, but also nosocomial.
