human rabies case in Russian Siberia
A man, 51 years old, was attacked by wolf in Norilsk district of
Krasnoyarsk region (near 69 degrees N) at the end of March 1998. Multiple
wounds of head, face, shin and hand finger took place. Concentrated rabies
vaccine (Rabivac, Vnukovo-32) was injected on days 0, 3, 7, then the
patient declined [further] immunization. RIG was unavailable because the
territory was free of rabies during many years. The patient felt ill on day
25 after incident and died 6 days later with classical rabies symptoms.
The virus strain was isolated from human brain using the mouse inoculation
test in our laboratory. Mouse brain impressions were studied with
antinucleocapsid monoclonal anti-bodies. Bright fluorescence [was] obtained
with MAb P-41 (German Federal Res. Inst. Anim. Vir. Dis.; courtesy of Dr.
L.Schneider) was typical for rabies. The arctic fox strain from
Yakutia was used as positive control and the fox strain from Western
Siberia as negative. The reactivity pattern with Wistar MAbs (Wistar Inst.,
USA; courtesy of Drs. H.Koprowski, C.Rupprecht) was very similar to arctic
fox strains.
No human rabies cases were registered in [the] Krasnoyarsk region since
1955 (earlier data are unavailable at the moment). Only 5 animal rabies
cases (dogs) were reported during last 2 decades: 1981 - 3, 1990 - 1, 1994
- 1. The North of the region is [a] territory of high density of arctic
fox, the species known as main host of arctic rabies.
