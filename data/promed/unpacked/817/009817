[1] HFRS - Mariy-El
Date: Fri 25 Apr 2009

For the 1st quarter of 2009, 44 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS) were recorded in the Republic of Mariy-El. The incidence
rate is 6.3 per 100 000 inhabitants, 7 times more than during the same
period of the previous year. In January [2009], 33 cases were recorded
followed by 10 cases in February and none in March 2009 [and one
unaccounted for - Mod.CP].

Diagnosis of HFRS has been confirmed in residents of the cities of
Yoshkar-Ola, Volzhsk, Kozmodemyansk, as well as in the Paranginsky,
Medvedevsky, Morkinsky, Sovetsky, Volzhsky, Zvenigovsky, Kuzhenersky,
Mary-Turaksky, Orshansky, and Sernursky districts. Two persons contracted
HFRS outside the Republic, in Tatarstan. These figures confirm the
unfavorable prognosis suggested by adverse epidemiologic and epizootic
factors occurring during the winter of 2008-2009.

[2] HFRS - Orenburg
Date: Thu 23 Apr 2009

<http://www.regnum.ru/news/1154921.html>


The incidence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in the
Orenburg Oblast (region) in 2008 was 14.7 per 100 000 inhabitants. This
incidence is 38.7 per cent more than the 2007 rate. This level of morbidity
exceeds the average level in Russia by a factor of 2.2.

HFRS disease has been recorded in 9 cities and 32 districts of the Orenburg
Oblast. In 2009, 65 cases were recorded. This figure is 29 per cent more
than in the same period of the previous year. The prognosis for HFRS during
the spring and summer of 2009 remains unfavorable due to adverse epizootic
and epidemiological factors. The high level of hantavirus infection in the
rodent population together with the high density of rodents and the
predominance of the principle reservoir (the red vole) in the rodent
population are all contributing factors. The red vole is the principal
reservoir of HFRS infection in the Orenburg Oblast.

[Over 90 per cent of all cases of HFRS in Russia are recorded in the
Privolzhsky Federal District of Russia. The most unfavorable territories
are Tatarstan, Udmurtia, Bashkortostan, Mariy-El, Mordovia, Orenburg,
Ulyanovsk, Saratov. High density of rodents and insufficient rodent control
measures are responsible for this situation. - Mod.NP
