Javier Ponce Cevallos, Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Aquaculture and Fisheries (MAGAP), declared once again a state of emergency for the banana sector. He announced that the decree would be valid for a period of 2 months.

Ponce pointed out that once the declaration is signed, instructions will be given on how to apply the necessary measures to help this sector. The goal is to finalise the purchase of banana bunches and fumigate the farms. To comply with the fumigation, instructions will be given.

This purchase by the government seeks to help small and medium growers who are unable to sell their fruit in the market.

[Black sigatoka (BS), also known as black leaf streak, is caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_ which affects only species and hybrids of _Musa_. Worldwide, BS is one of the most devastating leaf diseases of bananas, with yield losses of 50 percent or more. It is present in the Americas, China, Southeast Asia, and parts of Africa. Infection occurs on the youngest leaves of the plant; older leaves are not readily infected.

BS seriously affects photosynthetic ability, and fruit can ripen prematurely during commercial shipment, causing further losses. It is spread by water, wind and contaminated materials including suckers for planting. Disease management includes frequent applications of fungicides, phytosanitary measures to reduce inoculum and cultural practices, but the high costs of these measures make them essentially unavailable to smallholder farmers. Use of agrochemicals may also cause problems for fruit export, for example to Europe.

The related species _M. musicola_ causes yellow sigatoka (YS) with similar symptoms. YS causes less damage because symptoms appear mainly on older leaves. There are more crop cultivars with degrees of resistance to YS than to BS.

BS (and also YS) continue to spread in the Americas and Caribbean and are causing serious crop losses in the region. In Ecuador, a state of emergency to fight BS was previously declared in 2011 when 95 percent of the crop was affected in Manabi province (ProMED-mail post 20110706.2043). A resistance breeding programme has been established in the country.
