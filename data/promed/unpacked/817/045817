A cholera outbreak has killed 3 people in Nyando District in the last 2
weeks, according to health officials. However, villagers reckon they have
witnessed up to l0 deaths. District Public Health Officer Francis Makau
said no one had been hospitalized with cholera at the local health centres
"in the past 12 hours". He said: "It is true we are battling a cholera
outbreak in Lower Nyakach and Katolo sub-location, but the claim by the
villagers is false and alarmist." The situation had been brought under
control, the official said. "We have treated water sources and closed down
all open-air eating places in local markets."

Health officials in the Federated States of Micronesia intend to vaccinate
the entire population over the age of 2 against cholera. The epidemic,
which broke out several months ago, has struck more than 2 000 residents
and killed 15 people. Several neighbor island states have imposed
restrictions on food imports. Regional epidemiologist, Dr. Jean-Paul
Cheiney, said the worst seems to be over. Hospitals that once treated up to
30 patients a day are now treating about 8 a day.

A severe diarrhea epidemic which also causes victims to vomit profusely has
been raging in Mekambo in Gabon's north-east district of Zadie district for
a few weeks now, the National Press Agency reported Friday. It said mainly
young children were victims of the epidemic, and that it had rarely caused
death among patients. The Mekambo Health Centre, which has been deserted
due to a lack of medical supplies and equipment, however, admits people
stricken by this disease and administers simple re-hydration solutions, the
only products that seem to be readily available.

GUWAHATI: Malaria and waterborne diseases have killed 70 people and
sickened 600 in Assam since floods and monsoon rains ravaged much of the
northeastern state this month, a government official said on Wednesday. 50
people have died of gastroenteritis in western Assam's Kokrajhar district,
while more than 75 people, mostly children, are suffering from disease,
said John Ingti Kathar, the district magistrate. Gastroenteritis is
spreading quickly in Kokrajhar since tens of thousands of people have
started returning to their villages after the flooding. The swollen rivers
have become polluted and wells have become filled with sewage. "The
villagers have become victims of their own folly as they eat half-cooked
food and drink dirty water from the river, resulting in disease," Kathar said.
