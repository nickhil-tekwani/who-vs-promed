A 42-year-old woman and her 87-year-old mother came to the emergency ward of our hospital suffering from diplopia and hoarseness since the previous day. 4 days earlier, both ate a pork spread, which was already expired for 1.5 months. The spread was kept in a bottled jar. It is not known whether the jar had previously been opened or not.

Two days after consumption, both women experienced a dry feeling in their throats in the morning and difficulties in swallowing by the afternoon. On the 3rd day, both reported hoarseness, leading them to consult their general physician who didn't find any clinical aberrations. Since both women suffered from diplopia the following day, they decided to visit the emergency ward. As the mother also suffered from a swollen leg, a deep vein thrombosis was ruled out. A CT scan of the head was negative in both cases. As the interval of symptoms had prolonged, we did not deliver a botulism antitoxin.

After having the patients transferred to the neurological ward, the women's symptoms worsened. On the 10th day, the mother had to be intubated due to respiratory insufficiency. She was suffering from hypercapnia [high concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood] but improved rapidly with controlled ventilation. A chest X-ray showed signs of pneumonia due to aspiration and she was treated first with amoxicillin/clavulanate and then with meropenem. Due to circulation insufficiency, catecholamines were administered. A paralytic ileus was treated with neostigmine. The patient was tracheostomized 2 weeks later, followed by successful sedation and weaning.

The patient is now conscious, awake, and breathing on her own, but still being treated in the ICU. Her daughter showed much milder symptoms, with comparatively only symptoms of dysphagia, and neither a danger of aspiration nor the need for parenteral feeding. She was discharged after 3 weeks.

In both patients, a serological test was positive for _Clostridium botulinum_ toxin. The confirmation was a result of a mouse bioassay performed by the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES) in Graz.

The Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES) in Graz has been the reference center for botulism in Austria since 2008. The statistics show 28 cases of botulism in Austria since 2000, with the majority stemming from foodborne toxin.

[ProMED thanks Dr Lenard for this report.

Most cases of foodborne botulism are not associated with commercially prepared food and it is not clear if the product was indeed commercially prepared. The spread was past expiration time but it is also possible that the cases occurred related to poor storage with lack of refrigeration after purchase. - Mod.LL
