An outbreak of _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ has been reported in
kindergarten children from the Sakhalin region. 33 children fell ill during
the period from 25 Jan to 1 Feb 2005. 15 persons have been hospitalized.
As a result of epidemiological investigation, it was established that the
outbreak was foodborne and connected to the use of salads made from fresh
and fermented cabbage, with the addition of fresh onions.

[The island of Sakhalin is located on the Far East coast of Russia. It is
separated from the continent by Tatar and Nevelskiy channels, and, on the
south, is separated from Hokkaido (Japan) also by water. - Corr. NP]
[A similar outbreak in kindergarten children was posted (see below) in
2002. Infection with _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ is a zoonosis, with reservoirs
in many animals, including rodents, rabbits, deer and a variety of birds.
Most individuals affected are children or young adults. The most common
presentation of this infection is mesenteric lymphadenitis presenting with
fever and right lower quadrant abdominal pain which can be confused with
acute appendicitis.
The diagnosis of infection with this bacterium can be made by isolation of
the organism from lymph node or stool. Serological tests can be helpful,
but cross-reactions are found between yersinae and other enteric organisms,
including some salmonellae. The manifestations of illness and mode of
diagnosis are not stated. - Mod.LL]
