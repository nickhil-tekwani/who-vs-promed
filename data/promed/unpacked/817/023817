The Ministry of Health (MOH) has identified the disease that has been claiming the lives of people in Manafwa district as blackwater fever, a severe complication of malaria in which red blood cells burst in the bloodstream, releasing haemoglobin directly into the blood vessels and the urine and leading to kidney failure.

In May [2018], 14 people died under unclear circumstances in Manafwa district. The victims were passing urine laced with blood [confirmed to be malaria; see ProMED-mail post Fri 8 June 2018]. Last month [June 2018], parliament directed the health ministry to investigate the cause of the deaths.

Dr Charles Olar, Director Clinical Services, said investigations revealed that the disease is not new in the country's healthcare system, adding that the recent outbreak has shown an increase in the number of deaths. "When you look at the fatality rate of the disease, we have seen an increase," he said. "In 2017 we recorded 9 deaths, but we have almost doubled that figure this month."

Records from the MOH show that the disease, which first manifested itself in 2003, has affected 500 people and claimed 32 lives. The disease is common in Bukomero Subcounty, Kiboga district.

The cause of the disease is unknown, but it is suspected to be an autoimmune reaction caused by the interaction of the malaria parasite and malaria medication such as quinine. According to Dr Olar, investigations are ongoing to establish the cause of blackwater fever.

The symptoms of the disease include a rapid pulse, high fever, chills, extreme prostration, rapidly developing anaemia, and passage of urine that is black or dark red in colour.

[Hematuria, or blood in the urine, is a symptom of hemorrhagic fevers that can be caused by malaria; a range of viruses including yellow fever, Ebola, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley fever; and bacterial infections such as leptospirosis and septicemia with disseminated intravascular coagulation.

The last outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in Uganda was found to be malaria by the Ministry of Health, Kampala. However, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever have been reported from Uganda in 2018 (See ProMED-mail post below), and further investigation is needed. It is noteworthy that the outbreak reported in May-June 2018, which turned out to be malaria, was also reported in Manafwa district. ProMED-mail will be happy to post further information. - Mod.EP
