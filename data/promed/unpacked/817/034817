A dead bat found in April [2021] near Malaga [Chelan County, Washington] was infected with white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease that can blight entire colonies, the state Department of Fish and Wildlife confirmed Monday [20 Sep 2021].

It's the 1st time white-nose syndrome has been confirmed in Chelan County, although wildlife biologists last year detected the fungus responsible for the disease in a sample of bat guano collected in the county. Wildlife officials said the dead bat was either a Yuma myotis or a little brown bat; the 2 species are common and difficult to distinguish visually.

White-nose syndrome does not affect humans or domesticated animals, but it can spread quickly among bat populations while they hibernate. The fungal infection attacks the skin, sometimes destroying bats' delicate wings and causing them to become uncharacteristically active during cold weather.

15 bat species in Washington are important predators of night-flying insects. Wildlife officials warn that the new detection, alongside other recent findings of white-nose syndrome or the fungus in Yakima and Mason counties in spring and summer, could indicate future population declines in several bat species.

The illness has also been detected in bats in King, Kittitas, and Pierce counties, while the white-nose fungus has been found in samples from Lewis, Mason, Snohomish, and Yakima counties.

If you locate a dead or injured bat, do not handle it. Sightings of sick or dead bats, or bats behaving strangely -- such as flying outside during the day in winter or spring -- report your sighting online or call Fish and Wildlife at 360-902-2515.
