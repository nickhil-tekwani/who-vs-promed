Public health officials in Tokyo have confirmed that four outbreaks of food
poisoning in 1997 and 1998 were caused by an antibiotic-resistant
_Salmonella_ known as DT104, Asahi Shimbun has learned. The four
outbreaks, which affected 27 people, are the first involving DT104 reported
in Japan. None of the 27 patients died.
DT104, which was first detected in Britain in 1984, has caused several mass
food poisonings in Europe and the United States. In 1996, DT104 accounted
for more than 30 percent of food poisonings caused by _Salmonella_ bacteria
in the United States.
The Japanese cases were confirmed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Research
Laboratory of Public Health, which studied 36 outbreaks of _Salmonella_
poisoning between 1987 and 1998. The findings come as the Health and
Welfare Ministry is conducting its own nationwide survey on DT104
infection. The ministry is expected to publish an interim report on the
subject in April.
The Tokyo research laboratory's survey found that four of its 36 cases--one
in 1997 involving 11 patients and three in 1998 involving a total of 16
patients--were caused by DT104. In many cases, patients contracted DT104
by eating raw meat. Two of the four outbreaks were linked to raw liver from
cattle.
_Salmonella_ [food poisoning is potentially deadly if contracted by the
elderly, young or infirm. Victims die of blood poisoning, which in the case
of DT104 [frequently cannot be controlled with antibiotics. Haruo
Watanabe, chief of the bacteriology department at the National Institute of
Infectious Diseases, said people should avoid eating raw meat to avoid
falling ill.

the incidence of _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT104 in Japan. Although the
laboratory work appears to have been done in Tokyo, there is no indication
of the actual location(s) of the outbreaks described. - Mods.JW/ES
