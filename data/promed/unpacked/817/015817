Increasing footrot infections in some New South Wales (NSW) sheep areas have led to the formation of a new producer-led steering committee to help develop a plan to fight the spread. NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) today [12 Jul 2021] announced the new NSW Footrot Steering Committee (FSC) will provide ongoing oversight and strategic direction to the NSW Footrot Management Program.

Incoming chair of the NSW Footrot Steering Committee, Derek Schoen, said the aim is to improve the outcomes of footrot management in sheep flocks across the state and a major role of the committee will be to achieve national definitions for virulent and benign footrot.

Mr Schoen said the prevalence of footrot has increased in some areas with the better seasonal conditions since the drought. "With a lot of people scrambling to increase stock (numbers), we have seen an increase in footrot outbreaks, and we want to get on top of it and get some policy positions in place to assist the industry in managing this animal husbandry disease and its potential production loss."

Mr Schoen said footrot prevalence varied across the state, was higher in high rainfall areas. His region, Murray Local Land Services (LLS), with probably the state's 2nd highest sheep numbers, had 18 affected flocks or a prevalence of about 1.6%. There were 21 affected flocks in the Central Tablelands region or a prevalence of 1.2%. "As you would understand, with the movement of stock, that could very quickly balloon out, so we want to make sure we keep it under control and keep it manageable."

Mr Schoen said the prevalence of footrot in the state is "slightly increasing," although the committee is waiting for the latest figures to see where the problem areas are.

The footrot status of the peri-urban flocks around Sydney which might lack Property Identify Codes and trade sheep through online sites without "an eye for biosecurity" was also a concern. "We really don't know the prevalence out there and it is also a potential risk."

Mr Schoen said the committee's "number one" role will be getting a national definition for footrot, with each state having different definitions for benign and virulent footrot. "It manifests itself in different ways in different areas. It is important we identify the difference between our geographic regions."

He said there were enormously varying opinions as to what should be classified as footrot and definitions varied between the states. "We don't have any national agreement on what we should be calling footrot. I think it is important that we get a national consensus on what we are going to determine as footrot," Mr Schoen said. "Until we can get a recognition of what we are going to call footrot, it is very hard to move forward."

Mr Schoen said some states do not take footrot as seriously as New South Wales and some states claimed it didn't exist in their flocks. "It really is buyer beware when purchasing stock from interstate and it is important to get an animal health statement to ensure you are buying clean stock or have some come-back if you do have a problem. It's also vitally important to quarantine stock before you run them out with any other sheep."

Mr Schoen said the Murray LLS region's location along the river border with Victoria and its footrot prevalence statistics "speak for themselves" and indicated interstate sheep movement was "most probably" an issue for the state.

Mr Schoen said the committee would be working on a strategic plan for footrot aimed at strengthening New South Wale's biosecurity to lessen the effect of footrot in the state. "We're trying to get on the front foot here...and not a rotten one."

New FSC members joining Mr Schoen, a southern Riverina sheep producer and former NSW Farmers' Association president, are sheep producers Scott Watkins (Finley), Craig Mitchell (Cooma), Will Martel (Wellington) and Jock Fletcher (Walcha), 3 LLS representatives and a delegate of the CVO from NSW DPI. NSW DPI senior veterinary officer, Amanda Walker, will serve as the executive officer.

"(The) Committee members have demonstrated a strategic approach to farming, an ability to resolve competing priorities and practical knowledge in dealing with footrot," Mr Schoen said. "Their skills and expertise will help inform the NSW Footrot Strategic Plan and provide advice to the NSW Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO), who has responsibility for the footrot program."

Technical advice and analysis to support a strategic approach to footrot management will be delivered by a newly reinstated Footrot Technical Committee, which last operated in 2009. Mr Schoen said the new committee will serve a 3-year term and aims to build on the success of the NSW FSC, which was formed in 1988. The previous committee has not met regularly since 2009, he said.

"By 2009, the whole of NSW was declared a Footrot Protected Area with virulent footrot prevalence of less than one percent, which was one of the goals of the original strategic plan," he said. "The footrot program is recognised as a positive example of the results which can be achieved when industry and government work in partnership. We thank the outgoing chair and committee members for their commitment to the management of footrot in NSW."

An NSW DPI spokesman said a review of the strategic direction of the footrot program in NSW was undertaken to look at ways the committee could be structured to best serve our state's sheep producers. "As a result, a new committee was formed, with increased sheep producer and Local Land Services (LLS) representation. The previous NSW Footrot Steering Committee continued to function up until the transition to the newly structured committee."

The spokesman said the prevalence of footrot in NSW remains less than one percent; however, case numbers can vary depending on seasonal conditions. "Following a flood event or wet season, producers typically report an increase in footrot, which is then managed and control under the NSW footrot program, while in drier times there is generally a reduction of cases. There can be delays in expression and therefore detection of footrot in a flock or herd, making it very difficult to determine the single cause of an outbreak," he said.

"Many changes to the sheep industry have occurred since the initiation of the original program in 1988 with a different flock demographic, expression of disease and management. The new committee, led by Derek Schoen, will provide ongoing oversight and strategic direction to the NSW Footrot Management Program, which includes reviewing the current NSW Footrot Strategic Plan to assess if it is meeting the needs of NSW sheep and goat producers in the current environment."

[Foot rot is a serious disease. Affected livestock do not gain as well or produce wool or meat as well. It is stressful for the animals and equally or more stressing for the owner of the flock or herd, in the case of cattle. It is a costly disease and the NSW Department of Primary Industries' website (https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/animals-and-livestock/sheep/health) has a number of different helpful topics regarding food rot. Some of them are posted below.

"Footrot is a contagious bacterial disease of sheep and goats, caused by the organism _Dichelobacter nodosus_ (_D. nodosus_) in association with a number of other bacteria.

"There are many strains of _D. nodosus_ and they vary in the severity of the disease they cause. In an infected flock, several strains of _D. nodosus_ may be present. For regulatory purposes, footrot infection is classified as either benign or virulent at the flock level.

"With full expression, virulent footrot is a severe, debilitating disease with significant economic loss from reduced wool growth and quality, poor ewe fertility, poor growth rates, losses from blowfly strike, and reduced value of sale sheep. In infected flocks, there are also significant costs associated with the control of the disease.

"Because of these animal welfare and economic impacts virulent footrot is a notifiable disease in NSW with regulatory support for compulsory eradication programs in infected flocks.

"Topics include:
- The NSW Footrot Strategic Plan
- Footrot -- the disease
- Strain differentiation
- Distinguishing between the forms of footrot
- Footrot scoring guide
- Dealing with footrot
- Phases of an eradication program
- Footrot in goats
- Footrot in cattle"

"Specific strain footrot vaccine is a relatively new treatment for virulent footrot. Once footrot is diagnosed in a flock by a veterinarian, the specific strains of the footrot bacteria that are present in that flock of sheep can be identified using further testing. Once all of the individual strains present are known, a vaccine covering just those strains can be produced for use on that farm.

"This primefact includes:
- What are specific strain footrot vaccines?
- Development of the specific strain vaccine
- How should specific strain footrot vaccines be used?
- Using specific strain vaccine in a footrot eradication program
- Accessing specific strain footrot vaccine in NSW

"In addition to Primefact 1535 a factsheet is now available. This factsheet 'Diagnosis for specific vaccination' is for veterinarians and outlines the requirements for laboratory diagnosis of footrot for specific strain vaccine production" (Source: https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/animals-and-livestock/sheep/health/footrot/footrot-and-specific-strain-vaccine). - Mod.TG
