After 3 cases of bird flu have been reported in Slovakia recently, 2 more are confirmed. These have been located near Komárno [Nitra region], close to the 3rd source of avian influenza of H5 sub-type in wild birds, the SITA newswire wrote. After a chicken breeding farm in Dúbravka [Bratislava] and cases in Bratislava and the Košice zoo, this is the 3rd source, the Agriculture Ministry informed the SITA newswire.

On [9 Jan 2017], 2 dead swans were reported to the Regional Veterinary and Food Administration (RVPS) Komárno, on a soil-improvement channel near the village of Lándor. Meanwhile, one more dead swan has been examined, from the Číčov pond [Komárno District]. Still later, mass deaths of swans on the Kava gravel pond were announced.

The chief executive officer [CEO] of the State Veterinary and Food Administration, Jozef Bíreš, said that on [11 Jan 2017] the samples from the swans at Lándor and Číčov were confirmed to have had the AI H5 subtype (different from H5N1) virus. The case from Kava has not been officially confirmed yet.

"Our call to breeders is still effective -- to stick to biological protection of their breeds, and to prevent contacts with wild birds," agriculture minister Gabriela Matečná told SITA.

Avian influenza continues to wreak havoc in France. While thousands of ducks were slaughtered in nearly 190 municipalities in south west France, 2 corpses of swans with avian influenza were discovered in the department of Ain [Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region]. The prefect of the department, Arnaud Cochet, has filed a decree aiming to prevent the spread of avian influenza in neighboring farms.

Ain prefecture announced via its website the discovery of new cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8. 2 swans were found dead on a pond in Bouligneux commune. After analysis, infection by avian influenza has been confirmed.

The authorities immediately reacted by setting up a temporary control zone on municipalities located within 5 kilometers [3 mi] from the place of the discovery of the 2 dead animals. The communes concerned are Bouligneux, La Capelle du Chatelard, Lapeyrouse, Marlieux, Le Plantay, Saint-Germain-sur-Renon, Sandrans, and Villars-les-Dombes.

Veterinary checks will be carried out to verify that the containment measures are being implemented. In addition, any discovery of a bird's corpse must be reported to the authorities. The temporary control zone may be lifted if no new cases of avian influenza are detected.

The Department of Agriculture has confirmed a case of bird flu detected in a wild duck in Galway [County, Connacht province] -- the 2nd case recorded in Ireland in the past 2-and-a-half weeks. The H5N8 strain of avian influenza was confirmed by the department in a wigeon, but the exact location in Galway has not yet been disclosed.

It is the same highly contagious strain that was detected in Wexford on [28 Dec 2016], as well as in the UK and mainland Europe.

The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has confirmed that the risk to humans is considered to be very low. "The Department reiterates once again the requirement to confine poultry and other birds, and to apply strict biosecurity measures to prevent the introduction of avian influenza. Poultry flock owners should remain vigilant for any signs of disease in their flocks, and report any disease suspicion to their nearest Department Veterinary Office."

A virulent bird flu virus has spread to 55 poultry farms in Bulgaria prompting the veterinary authorities to announce a cull of some 430 000 birds since it was first detected in the middle of December [2016], agriculture minister Dessislava Taneva said on [Sat 14 Jan 2017]. The Balkan country has also registered 4 cases of bird flu in wild ducks since mid-December [2016].

Bulgaria has imposed a nationwide ban on poultry markets and on the hunting of game birds, and has already spent over a million levs (USD 543 714) to cull birds in a bid to contain the outbreak. "In Bulgaria, we have usually registered bird flu in wild birds in the past few years. It is the 1st time we have had so many outbreaks in farms," Taneva told Bulgarian Darik radio.

The southern region of Plovdiv was most affected by the highly pathogenic virus H5N8, she said, pointing out that some 300 000 birds, mainly ducks, were culled and another 130 000 were to be killed on [Sat 14 Jan 2017].

The Czech Veterinary authorities have confirmed the 1st case of bird flu in Prague. The deadly H5N8 virus was confirmed in a dead swan found on the banks of the Vltava River in Prague 7. No special measures will be taken for the time being in the Czech capital. The bird flu has been confirmed in 6 other locations in the Czech Republic. 13 000 birds have been slaughtered since the 1st case was confirmed just over a week ago, to try and prevent the spread of the disease.

HPAI H5 (where neuraminidase typing was available it turned out to be H5N8), continues to occur throughout Europe. This virus has infected poultry, wild and captive birds in several countries, causing immense losses to the poultry industry. Some recent studies suggest that wild waterfowl and domestic ducks are important in the emergence and maintenance of HPAI H5N8. - Mod.PMB]
