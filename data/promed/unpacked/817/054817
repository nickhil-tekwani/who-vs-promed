The San Lucas Medical Center in Gualeguaychu [Entre Rios province} confirmed a hantavirus [infection] case in the city. [The case] concerns a 35 year old man who is a gatherer of firewood and has been working in the elimination of rats [rodents]. The patient had been admitted with a clinical picture of pneumonia and the samples sent to Malbran Hospital confirmed the case [as a hantavirus infection]. In respect [to this case], physician Javier Geuna stated that the man's health has been progressing favorably, and he is off of the respirator.

The health professional said that, "the disease [virus] is transmitted by rodents, and the portal of entry [of the virus] is direct contact or at the respiratory level. This person was working in an area where there had been a large number of rodents, in a firewood storage area, and in the elimination of rats. Later, he broke out with the disease." He added, "there have been other suspected cases ... this is the 1st confirmed case."

Geuna explained that the hantavirus "[causes] a cardio-respiratory [disease] that compromises the respiratory and cardiac functions, and on occasion can become severe," and indicated that the current case had strong respiratory assistance support. "In many cases, the mortality is high," he remarked.

He warned that "the disease [must be] controlled and rats eliminated. Health authorities must review where there is a high concentration of trash and firewood, to which home [rodent] control by each person should be added."

[Cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina last year (2012) and are beginning to be recognized again this year (2013). In 2011, there were 4 confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Entre Rios province, 2 of whom died (see ProMED-mail archive no 20110523.1562).

The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the current one above, are not specified. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_).

Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case.
