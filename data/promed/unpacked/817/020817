For Minnesota, the threat of chronic wasting disease (CWD) is starting to get real. Winona county had its 1st confirmed case of the deadly deer disease this winter [2018-2019] near Pickwick, and an ongoing outbreak near Preston in Fillmore County may be slowly spreading.

Far from Southeast Minnesota, the recent discovery of a CWD-positive wild deer north of Brainerd, MN got the rest of the state's attention, not to mention University of Minnesota experts raising alarms about the potential for CWD to someday spread from deer to humans. Now state officials want to get serious about CWD.

"We feel we're really at a crossroads here with the disease. We're at a critical point," Department of Natural Resources (DNR) commissioner Sarah Strommen stated. If the state acts now, there is a chance to effectively contain the disease in Southeast Minnesota and, hopefully, eliminate the disease in Northern Minnesota, she said. If the state does not act, it may miss that chance, Strommen stated. "We need to respond quickly. We need to respond aggressively," she told the Post. "We know what we need to do. We need to remove deer from the landscape. We need to reduce that density ... but to enact that plan, it takes resources."

Last month [February 2019], as part of his state budget proposal, Governor Tim Walz called for the legislature to appropriate USD 4.6 million to fund the DNR's anti-CWD efforts over the next 2 years and appropriate USD 1.1 million annually after that. The money would help the DNR continue and expand its current strategies in combatting CWD: organizing special hunts, working with landowners to cull deer, and in a few areas, hiring United States Department of Agriculture sharpshooters to kill deer. The goal is to both monitor the disease -- harvested deer are tested for CWD -- and to reduce the density of the deer population in infected areas. "It is spread primarily through [animal-to-animal] contact, so obviously when you have less dense concentrations of animals, the chances of diseased animals coming into contact with another animal and spreading the disease to that animal are lessened," Strommen explained.

Up till now, the DNR's anti-CWD work has been funded by deer hunting licenses. Walz's proposal would be the 1st time Minnesota has used general-fund tax dollars to combat the disease. Walz's proposal recognizes that CWD affects all of Minnesota, Strommen said. If left unchecked, CWD poses a big risk to health of Minnesota deer, to Minnesota's long tradition of deer hunting, and to communities depending on economic activity from deer hunting, she added.

The Minnesota Board of Animal Health (BAH) also plays an important role in controlling CWD. While the DNR regulates wild deer, BAH regulates elk and deer farms. The 1st cases of CWD in Minnesota occurred at deer and elk farms, and many of the subsequent outbreaks in wild deer happened near infected farms, including the recent discoveries of infected deer in Northern Minnesota and near Pickwick. Last year [2018], a report by the Minnesota legislative auditor criticized BAH for lax regulation of deer and elk farms and recommended the BAH seriously enforce its existing rules to protect Minnesota from CWD. In a joint press release this year [2019], Strommen and BAH senior veterinarian Mackenzie Reberg pledged that both agencies were committed to working together to fight CWD.

The Minnesota Deer Hunters Association (MDHA) recently urged the state to adopt new rules for deer and elk farms, including requirements for 2 layers of fencing around deer farms, a moratorium on new farms, and a program for the state to voluntarily buy out and close existing farms. Bills to do just that have been proposed in both the Minnesota Senate and House of Representatives.

The MDHA also called for the state to eliminate antler point restrictions statewide. DNR regulations currently ban hunters in Southeast Minnesota from harvesting bucks with less than 4 antler points on one side except in CWD management zones. The MDHA's proposal would allow hunters to harvest younger bucks outside CWD zones. Strommen's office has not endorsed the proposal.

Given the outbreak in Southeast Minnesota and the new discovery in Northern Minnesota, "It is imperative Minnesota act now to protect its wild deer herd," MDHA executive director Craig Engwall stated. "We are pleased with the actions the DNR has taken to address CWD, as well as Governor Walz's budget proposal .... We urge the DNR, the governor, and the legislature to work together to vigorously pursue these measures," he added.

In addition to the DNR's efforts to contain CWD, state lawmakers are also proposing funding for research and development of a new CWD test. Currently, the state uses a test requiring lymph nodes to be harvested from dead deer; the test can take a week or more for results. Senator Mike Goggin (R-Red Wing) has sponsored a bill giving the U of M USD 1.8 million to work on developing a test that could be conducted on living deer.

Later this month [March 2019], the DNR is hosting public open houses across the state to solicit feedback on deer-hunting regulations. DNR officials said the meetings would also include a preview of a draft plan for how the state will respond to CWD. The nearest meeting will be held in St Charles from 6-8 pm on 26 Mar 2019 at St Charles City Hall, 830 Whitewater Avenue.

[This article clearly indicates that the disease has spread to another county. Much of this article seems to focus on new regulations, such as fencing, and bills to eliminate farmed deer (cevids) and a need for more/better testing.

For years, actually decades, there has been a need to have a live animal test. Currently, there is an immunohistochemistry test for live deer at the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory. One wonders why other labs are not partnering with this lab to learn the method and have regulatory agencies approve it. While new methods are always needed, this would be one way to start the process.

Perhaps it is time to consider that the causative agent may not be a prion, as has been touted for decades, but may be another cause. Perhaps research should look in other directions to identify whether there is another cause of this disease. - Mod.TG
