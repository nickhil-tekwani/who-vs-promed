[1] Year 3: what to expect

In the well-vaccinated wealthier countries of the world, year 3 of the pandemic will be better than year 2, and COVID-19 will have much less impact on health and everyday activities. Vaccines have weakened the link between cases and deaths in countries such as Britain and Israel [see chart at the source URL above]. But in countries that are poorer, less well vaccinated, or both, the deleterious effects of the virus will linger. A disparity of outcomes between rich and poor countries will emerge. The Gates Foundation, one of the world's largest charities, predicts that average incomes will return to their pre-pandemic levels in 90% of advanced economies, compared with only 1/3 of low- and middle-income economies.

Although the supply of vaccines surged in the last quarter of 2021, many countries will remain under-vaccinated for much of 2022, as a result of distribution difficulties and vaccine hesitancy. This will lead to higher rates of death and illness and weaker economic recoveries. The "last mile" problem of vaccine delivery will become painfully apparent as health workers carry vaccines into the planet's poorest and most remote places. But complaints about unequal distribution will start to abate during 2022 as access to patients' arms becomes a larger limiting factor than access to jabs. Indeed, if manufacturers do not scale back vaccine production there will be a glut by the 2nd half of the year, predicts Airfinity, a provider of life-sciences data.

Booster jabs will be more widely used in 2022 as countries develop an understanding of when they are needed. New variants will also drive uptake, says Stanley Plotkin of the University of Pennsylvania, inventor of the rubella vaccine. Dr Plotkin says current vaccines and tweaked versions will be used as boosters, enhancing protection against variants.

The vaccination of children will also expand, in some countries to those as young as 6 months. Where vaccine hesitancy makes it hard for governments to reach their targets they will be inclined to make life difficult for the unvaccinated -- by requiring vaccine passports to attend certain venues and making vaccination compulsory for groups such as healthcare workers.

Immunity and treatments may be widespread enough by mid-2022 to drive down case numbers and reduce the risk of new variants. At this point, the virus will become endemic in many countries. But although existing vaccines may be able to suppress the virus, new ones are needed to cut transmission.

Stephane Bancel, the boss of Moderna, a maker of vaccines based on mRNA technology, says his firm is working on a "multivalent" vaccine that will protect against more than one variant of COVID-19. Beyond that, he is looking at a "pan-respiratory" vaccine combining protection against multiple coronaviruses, respiratory viruses, and strains of influenza.

Other innovations in COVID-19 vaccines will include freeze-dried formulations of mRNA jabs and vaccines that are given via skin patches or inhalation. Freeze-dried mRNA vaccines are easy to transport. As the supply of vaccines grows in 2022, those based on mRNA will be increasingly preferred, because they offer higher levels of protection. That will crimp the global market for less effective vaccines, such as the Chinese ones.

In rich countries, there will also be a greater focus on antibody treatments for people infected with covid-19. America, Britain, and other countries will rely more on cocktails such as those from Regeneron or AstraZeneca.

Most promising of all are new antiviral drugs. Pfizer is already manufacturing "significant quantities" of its protease inhibitor. In America, the government has agreed to buy 1.2bn courses of an antiviral drug being developed by Merck, known as molnupiravir. This has shown its efficacy in trials, and the company has licensed it for widespread, affordable production.

There are many other antivirals in the pipeline. Antiviral drugs that can be taken in pill form, after diagnosis, are likely to become blockbusters in 2022, helping make COVID-19 an ever more treatable disease. That will lead, in turn, to new concerns about unequal access and of misuse fostering resistant strains.

The greatest risk to this more optimistic outlook is the emergence of a new variant capable of evading the protection provided by existing vaccines. The coronavirus remains a formidable foe.

[2] Long COVID

Why the physical and economic pain of 'long COVID' will probably well outlast the pandemic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Millions of people who have gotten COVID-19 and survived are finding that a full recovery can be frustratingly elusive. Weeks or even months after seemingly recovering from even a mild case, many patients still confront a wide range of health problems. As researchers try to measure the duration and depth of what's being called "long COVID," specialized, post-acute COVID clinics are opening to handle the patients. The scale of the pandemic and persistence of some of COVID's disabling effects mean the economic pain and drain on health resources could continue well after the contagion ends.

1. What do we know about long COVID?
Most patients who suffer from COVID-19 fully recover, but some suffer long-term pulmonary, cardiovascular, and nervous system problems as well as psychological effects. These can occur irrespective of the initial severity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection but happen more frequently in women, the middle-aged, and individuals who experienced more COVID symptoms initially. A large study published in November [2021] also found differences by age, race, sex, and baseline health status, using data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs [Xie Y, Bowe B, Al-Aly Z. Burdens of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 by severity of acute infection, demographics, and health status. Nat Commun. 2021; 12(1): 6571; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26513-3].

Although most long COVID symptoms don't seem to be life-threatening, another study published in the journal Nature found that sufferers had a 59% increased risk of dying within 6 months. That High-dimensional characterization of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19works out to about 8 extra deaths per 1000 COVID patients--adding to the pandemic's hidden toll [Al-Aly Z, Xie Y, Bowe B. High-dimensional characterization of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. Nature. 2021; 594(7862): 259-264; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03553-9].

2. What's the definition?
According to the World Health Organization, people with what it calls "post COVID-19 condition" have symptoms usually 3 months after an initial bout of COVID that last for at least 2 months and can't be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Common ones include fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction -- all of which affect everyday functioning. These ailments may appear following recovery from the acute phase of COVID -- even one with no noticeable symptoms -- or persist well after the initial illness. Symptoms may also fluctuate or relapse over time. The WHO says this definition may change as new evidence emerges, and that a separate definition may be needed for children. Other groups have proposed alternative definitions based on the constellation of symptoms affecting such people, who are colloquially known as long-haulers.

3. How prevalent are long-term effects?
Researchers haven't studied enough cases over a long enough period to gauge the full range of effects, what proportion of patients will suffer from them, or for how long. Various published studies indicate that about 10-20% of people experience lingering symptoms for weeks to months after infection. Early findings and the demand for specialized clinics to help survivors deal with scarred lungs, chronic heart damage, fatigue, and other conditions indicate a significant prevalence. About 1.1 million people in the U.K. reported experiencing long COVID as of early September [2021], according to the Office for National Statistics. Of those:
- 405 000, or 37%, had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at least one year previously;
- 706 000, or 65%, said symptoms adversely affected day-to-day activities;
- 211 000, or 19%, reported that their ability to undertake day-to-day activities had been "limited a lot."

4. Is COVID-19 definitely to blame for these symptoms?
Not necessarily. A large study based on data from a US health plan published in the BMJ in May found that 14% of people infected with the coronavirus developed one or more related complications requiring medical care beyond the acute phase. [Daugherty SE, Guo Y, Heath K, et al. Risk of clinical sequelae after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection: retrospective cohort study. BMJ. 2021; 373: n1098; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n1098]. But so did 9% of people in a control group. Some symptoms might occur by chance or be triggered by stress and anxiety. Social restrictions, lockdowns, school and business closures, loss of livelihood, decreases in economic activity, and shifting priorities of governments all have the potential to substantially affect mental health, according to a study that appeared [8 Oct 2021] in the Lancet. [COVID-19 Mental Disorders Collaborators. Global prevalence and burden of depressive and anxiety disorders in 204 countries and territories in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lancet. 2021; 398(10312): 1700-1712; https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02143-7].

It found the pandemic has resulted in an extra 53.2 million cases of major depressive disorder and an extra 76.2 million cases of anxiety disorders globally. In some critical COVID cases, the life-saving treatment itself may cause problems. Such uncertainties have sometimes led to what patients describe as "medical gaslighting" by health professionals who don't take their complaints seriously, especially if the patient is a woman.

5. What are the broader implications?
Some researchers say the pandemic may spur a raft of long-term problems such as chronic fatigue syndrome, dementia, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and kidney impairment. An uptick in treatments for depression, anxiety, and pain has stoked concern of a spike in suicides and opioid overdoses. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a surge in overdose deaths in 2020. The reduced work hours reported in 69% of patients indicate the pandemic is having an impact on labor productivity. With almost 240 million confirmed infections worldwide as of October [2021], even a small share with a long-term disability could have enormous social and economic consequences. And these will be magnified if problems end up lasting for years or decades.

6. Do other viruses cause prolonged illness?
Yes. So-called post-viral syndromes occur after infections including the common cold, influenza, HIV, infectious mononucleosis, measles, and hepatitis B. Diabetes and other long-term consequences were observed in survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is caused by coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2. A Canadian study identified 21 healthcare workers from Toronto who had post-viral symptoms for as long as 3 years after catching SARS in 2003 and were unable to return to their usual work. Some people who were hospitalized with SARS in Hong Kong still had impaired lung function 2 years later, a study of 55 patients published in 2010 found. Still, it's not known yet whether the lessons of SARS are applicable to COVID-19.

7. What is being done?
In the US, Congress is providing some USD 1.15 billion in funding over 4 years for the National Institutes of Health to support research into the long-term effects of COVID. The studies hope to get at issues such as the underlying biological causes and how they might be treated and prevented. Some researchers are pressing governments to focus attention not only on infection and vaccination rates but on potential long-term organ damage. For example, researchers have shown the virus can infect insulin-producing pancreatic tissue, potentially triggering diabetes that in some cases persists beyond the acute infection. That's prompted Australia's Monash University and King's College London to create a global registry for studying "new onset" diabetes. Some long haulers have reported feeling better after receiving a COVID vaccination, prompting researchers to examine the phenomenon and whether vaccines can offer clues to treatment. Avindra Nath, clinical director of the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, said vaccines, including for flu, have been known to help patients with chronic fatigue, but relief has almost always been temporary.

[3] Pfizer vaccine
Date: Mon 8 Nov 2021 2:23 AM IST
Source: The Times of Israel [edited]
https://www.timesofisrael.com/pfizer-booster-shot-could-offer-protection-for-9-10-months-initial-data/


Leaked research conducted by an Israeli hospital indicates that 3rd shot yields more antibodies and that these antibodies are also better at preventing disease.

Pfizer's booster COVID-19 shot is effective for 9-10 months and maybe even longer, according to preliminary data from Israeli research leaked to Channel 12 news on [Sun 7 Nov 2021].

The network said initial results from a study on antibody levels being conducted by the Tel Hashomer Hospital are set to be made public in 2-4 weeks and will show that the 3rd shot offers different, apparently improved, protection from the 1st 2 doses.

The booster shot yields more antibodies, and the antibodies are also better at preventing the disease, the channel quoted people involved with the study as saying.

By analyzing the antibody levels, researchers have concluded that the 3rd shot could be effective for 9-10 months, or even longer, the researchers predicted.

No details were released on the scope or methodology of the Tel Hashomer study.

Israel began its mass booster campaign in August [2021] after finding that the protection offered by its initial 2-dose vaccine campaign began wearing off after some 5 months.

The latest research follows a large-scale Israeli study published last month [October 2021] that showed that a 3rd booster shot was 92% effective in preventing serious illness compared to those who received only 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine. [https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-study-covid-booster-shots-92-effective-at-preventing-serious-illness/].

The study conducted by Israel's largest HMO Clalit Health Services, with funding from Harvard Medical School, was published in the Lancet medical journal based on a study of 728 321 people who received the 3rd shot compared to a control group of a similar number who received only 2 shots at least 5 months before [Barda N, Dagan N, Cohen C, et al. Effectiveness of a third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for preventing severe outcomes in Israel: an observational study. Lancet. 2021: S0140-6736(21)02249-2; https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02249-2]

According to the report the 3rd dose [was] 93% effective at preventing admission to the hospital, with the health service recording 231 instances of hospitalization for the 2-dose group, compared to 29 for those who got a booster shot.

Similarly, the rate stood at 92% for severe disease with 157 cases in the control group compared to 17 among those in the 3rd shot category.

The study also found the booster shot was 81% effective in preventing COVID-related deaths, with just 7 recorded among those who got the booster shot compared to 44 deaths for those without.

The study period was [30 Jul 2020 to 23 Sep 2021] and participants had a median age of 51 years old. Israel has almost exclusively used the Pfizer shot.

Both groups reported significantly lower numbers of hospitalizations and deaths than those who were not vaccinated at all.

"The results demonstrate in a very convincing way that the 3rd dose of the vaccine is extremely efficient," said Ran Balicer, Clalit's chief innovation officer.

Israel was the 1st country to widely adopt the booster and the end of Israel's 4th wave has been credited at least in part to its booster vaccine campaign, which began among those over 65 in August [2021] and was quickly rolled out to the rest of the population. As of [Sun 7 Nov 2021], almost 4 million Israelis -- more than 42% of the total population -- have received a 3rd dose of the COVID vaccine. Close to 67% of the total population has received at least one shot.

Around 650 000 people who are eligible for vaccines have not received any of the shots, while about 1.1 million Israelis eligible for the booster have yet to receive it.

Since then the US and other countries have followed suit, although some have approved the booster only for the elderly or those with preexisting conditions.

The booster shots have been widely credited with helping Israel overcome a 4th wave of the virus.

The number of active COVID-19 cases in Israel has dropped to 5984 after being above 10 000 for over 3 months and after passing 90 000 in early September, according to figures released on [Sun 7 Nov 2021], by the Health Ministry.

The data also showed 194 new cases were confirmed on [Sat 6 Nov 2021], down from between 5000 and 6000 daily almost 2 months ago. There were 167 people hospitalized in a serious condition and the death toll stood at 8122.
