WEST NILE VIRUS - USA: USGS SUMMARY (02)

From: Michael Parry <michael_parry@stamhosp.chime.org>

I assume these data are from post mortem evaluations of dead birds. Is
there any information on the frequency of antibody detection in live birds,
i.e. what is the infection rate and death rate in crows and other bird
species?

[Bob McLean, Director of the National Wildlife Health Center, USGS, was
kind enough to respond in detail to my query to him regarding the methods
USGS is using to detection evidence of infection with West Nile virus. Bob
is a former employee of the CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Infectious
Diseases in Fort Collins and as knowledgeable a field biologist as I know.
In addition, he has extensive laboratory/virological experience, and the
methods he has put into use at the Madison, Wisconsin, facilities of USGS
undoubtedly are first rate. The USGS is collaborating with DVBID/CDC to
verify their results, when necessary. From his message, it appears that
the NWHC is using virus isolation, serology, pathology, and PCR for
diagnosis.
As for Dr. Parry's question: "What is the infection rate and death rate in
crows and other bird species?", we are not able to answer this at the
present. These studies will take a long time to complete but it would seem
useful and informative for our readers if there was an interim report made
when the data are available. There will be a workshop on the subject of
West Nile virus at CDC/Fort Collins next week and I am certain such
questions will be asked. - Mod.CHC]
