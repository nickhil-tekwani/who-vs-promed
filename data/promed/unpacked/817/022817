On Wed 30 Nov 2011, the head of epidemiology of the Departmental
[state or province equivalent] Health Department (SEDES), Wilfredo
Camargo, stated that strong efforts were made to control an outbreak
of the terrible hemorrhagic fever near Trinidad. He indicated that
currently 3 brigades are in the Elvira area along the highway to Santa
Cruz, 35 km [21 mi] from the capital of Beni [department], capturing
and identifying rodents. They are also training community members and
students of the educational institutions of this community to avoid
spread of the terrible disease, endemic in the Mamore province. "We
are moving from Elvira to Trinidad in all the ranches, dairy farms,
[agricultural] plots, and rice mills in the area," explained the
physician.

In parallel to this activity, a "zero prevalence" study is being done,
that is to say, people who more than a month ago presented with
symptoms including fever and pain, are being investigated in order to
determine if Machupo virus [antibodies?], which is transmitted by the
_Calomys callosus_, mouse circulated in their bodies.

Camargo reported that 80 per cent of the mice captured -- more than
200 in 7 days -- have been identified as _Calomys callosus_, which is
the host that transmits the disease [virus].

The specialist expressed his concern because in the 15 years that he
has worked in the area of hemorrhagic fever, it has been confirmed
that the virus has moved to other provinces, that is to say, it is not
just found in the endemic area of Mamore province. In 2004, 2 cases of
hemorrhagic fever were detected along the border with Cochabamba
[department], at which time the minister of health named the virus
Chapare; later other cases were registered in Santa Rosa, on the
border with Riberalta [municipality], Ballivian province [Beni].
[Chapare virus is distinct from Machupo virus. See comments below. -

[There are 2 arenaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever [HF] in Beni
department, Bolivia -- Machupo and Chapare viruses. Chapare virus
infections caused clinical HF, as mentioned above, near the border
with Cochabamba department in 2003 and 2004. RT-PCR analysis of the
Chapare virus isolate and subsequent analysis of the complete virus S
and L RNA segment sequences identified the virus as a member of the
New World clade B arenaviruses, which includes all the pathogenic
South American arenaviruses. The virus was shown to be most closely
related to Sabia virus, and distinct from Machupo virus, which is the
etiological agent of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever.
