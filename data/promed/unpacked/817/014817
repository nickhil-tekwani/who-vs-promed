The following background information of botulism in Italy was abstracted from Gideon (http://www.gideononline.com) and the Gideon e-book series (1,2) (primary references are available on request).

Botulism has been a notifiable disease in Italy since 1975. Mean disease rates are similar to those reported in the USA (see graph (3) at http://cdn.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Botulism-Italy.png).

Vegetable preserves are implicated in 57 percent of cases, and ham and sausage in 15 percent. Recent outbreaks have been related to mushrooms in oil, pickled olives, fresh-cheese mascarpone and roasted eggplant in oil.

In 2012, a man in England acquired botulism from imported Italian olives.

A total of 3 cases of wound botulism were reported during 1988 to 1998; and the 1st report of wound botulism in an injecting drug user was published in 2010.

A total of 26 cases of infant botulism (and 3 of adult intestinal botulism) were reported during 1984 to 2006 (including 6 cases due to _Clostridium butyricum_ toxin). Type A botulism accounted for 4 casers and type B for 17.

Only 2 outbreaks (5 cases, 1 fatal) of botulism were reported in Italy during 1903 to 1922; 5 outbreaks were reported in 1998 alone.

Notable outbreaks:
- 1993: Outbreaks (7 cases, in 2 outbreaks) of botulism were associated with commercially prepared roasted eggplant in oil.
- 1995 (publication year): An outbreak was associated with consumption of home-cured ham.
- 1996: An outbreak (8 cases) was ascribed to "tiramisu" which contained contaminated mascarpone cream cheese.
- 2004: An outbreak (25 cases, 0 fatal) was caused by green olives served by a restaurant in Molise [region].
- 2011: An outbreak (3 cases, 1 fatal) of botulism in Finland was caused by imported jarred olives from Italy.
