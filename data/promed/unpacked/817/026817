The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention says Maine recorded 370 cases of gonorrhea, the sexually transmitted disease, through October this year [2012]. That's up from 272 cases for all of last year and nearly 4 times the number in 2008.

State epidemiologist Dr. Stephen Sears tells the Bangor Daily News there's been an increase in sexually transmitted diseases in many parts of the country.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidelines in August [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR): Update to CDC's Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010: Oral Cephalosporins No Longer a Recommended Treatment for Gonococcal Infections. Weekly. August 10, 2012 / 61(31);590-594. Available at: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm] on how gonorrhea should be treated as the disease becomes resistant to more drugs.

[Gonorrhea is a major cause of serious reproductive complications in women and can facilitate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. The latest CDC data for sexually transmitted disease caused by _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ show that while reported rates were at historically low levels, cases increased slightly from 2009 to 2010 and more than 300 000 cases were reported in 2010. There are also signs from CDC surveillance systems that the disease has become resistant to several of the antibiotics previously available as treatment options (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats10/trends.htm).

The following is extracted from the CDC 2010 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Surveillance information that is available at http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats10/gonorrhea.htm:

During 1975-1997, the national gonorrhea rate declined 74 percent after implementation of the national gonorrhea control program in the mid-1970s (see http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats10/figures/14.htm). The gonorrhea rates decreased further to 98.1 cases per 100 000 population in 2009. This is the lowest rate since recording of gonorrhea rates began. The rate increased slightly in 2010 to 100.8 per 100 000 population, with 309 341 cases reported in the United States. However, the CDC estimates that fewer than half of gonococcal infections occurring in the U.S. are diagnosed and reported. The increase in gonorrhea rates during 2009-2010 was observed among men and women and among all racial/ethnic groups. During 2009-2010, rates increased in the Northeast, South, and West; gonorrhea rates decreased in the Midwest.

The CDC recommends the substitution of a drug in treatment regimens for gonococcal disease when the rate of resistance to that drug is 5 percent or higher in a general community so that all recommended treatments for gonorrhea can be expected to cure greater than 95 percent of gonococcal infections.

Only ceftriaxone meets the CDC's efficacy standards. Because of experience with other microbes that have developed antimicrobial resistance rapidly, combination therapy using 2 antimicrobials with different mechanisms of action is recommended to improve treatment efficacy and potentially delay emergence and spread of resistance to ceftriaxone.

Based on data from CDC's Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), the CDC recommends combination therapy with ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly and either azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days as the most reliably effective treatment for uncomplicated urogenital, anorectal, and pharyngeal gonorrhea (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm). The use of azithromycin as the 2nd antimicrobial is preferred to doxycycline because of the convenience and compliance advantages of single-dose therapy and the substantially higher prevalence of gonococcal resistance to tetracycline than to azithromycin among GISP isolates, particularly in strains with elevated cefixime MICs (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm).

The 250 mg IM dose ceftriaxone cures 99.2 percent of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal and 98.9 percent of pharyngeal infections in published clinical trials. A 250 mg dose of ceftriaxone is now recommended over a 125 mg dose given the 1) increasingly wide geographic distribution of isolates demonstrating decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins in vitro, 2) reports of ceftriaxone treatment failures, 3) improved efficacy of ceftriaxone 250 mg in pharyngeal infection (which is often unrecognized), and 4) the utility of having a simple and consistent recommendation for treatment regardless of the anatomic site involved.

When ceftriaxone cannot be used for treatment of urogenital or rectal gonorrhea, 2 alternative options are available: cefixime 400 mg orally plus either azithromycin 1 g orally or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily orally for 7 days if ceftriaxone is not readily available, or azithromycin 2 g orally in a single dose if ceftriaxone cannot be given because of severe allergy. However, if either of these alternative regimens is prescribed, then the patient should return in one week for a test-of-cure at the site of infection (http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/2012/GonorrheaTreatmentGuidelinesFactSheet8-9-2012.pdf).

Because of GISP data of declining cefixime susceptibility among urethral _N. gonorrhoeae_ isolates collected in the United States during 2006-2011, the CDC no longer recommends cefixime at any dose as a 1st-line regimen for treatment of gonococcal infections (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm).

Spectinomycin, which is useful in persons who cannot tolerate cephalosporins, is expensive, must be injected, and is not available in the United States. However, it has been effective in published clinical trials, curing 98.2 percent of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections. Spectinomycin has poor efficacy against pharyngeal infection (51.8 percent; 95 percent CI =38.7 percent-64.9 percent) (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/STD-Treatment-2010-RR5912.pdf).

Because of the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance, fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended for treatment of gonococcal infections (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5614a3.htm).
