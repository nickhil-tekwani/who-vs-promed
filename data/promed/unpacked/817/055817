99 cases of rabies among animals have been recorded so far this year
[2008] in the Kaluga Region. Rabies is spreading not only among wild
animals but also among pets and farm animals. More than 2300 people
have sought specialized medical treatment as a consequence of animal
bites during the 1st 6 months of 2008. This figure is 1.4-fold more
than during the same period in the previous year. Rabies cases among
humans have not been reported.

The heads of municipal organizations have been advised to actively
promote the immunization of wild and domestic animals, the control of
wild animal populations (foxes in the 1st instances), and the
reinforcement of measures to prosecute people who fail to ensure
adequate housing and containment of susceptible livestock.
