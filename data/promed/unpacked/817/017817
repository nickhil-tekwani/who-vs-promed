Swedish researchers have discovered a new tick-borne illness that can
cause blood clots in the legs and lungs, with 3 cases having been
reported in Sweden.

A total of 8 cases of the disease have been reported so far, with
patients in Germany, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic also having
been infected. All of those affected by the disease suffer from a
weakened immune system, the Dagens Nyheter (DN) newspaper reported.

The illness, which researchers call "neo disease" after the bacterium
that causes it, _Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis_, also brings
about flu-like symptoms with long-lasting high fevers, coughing, and
aches. The disease can be treated with antibiotics.

The 1st case was discovered in the summer of 2009 after a 77-year-old
man from Gothenburg came down with a high fever and lost
consciousness. During his treatment, doctors discovered blood clots in
his leg and lungs. The man's fever returned several times and doctors
eventually found traces of an unknown bacterium in his blood. The
disease, which is transmitted by ticks, had never before been reported
in Sweden and it was unclear what caused the disease in humans. The 2
additional Swedes who have become ill due to the bacteria are in their
60s and 70s.

It remains unclear why the disease causes blood clots, but researchers
have a number of theories in mind. "When the body can't deal with an
infection in the blood, it traps the infection in a blood clot,"
Christine Wenneras, a professor at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in
Gothenburg, told the newspaper.

According to researchers, 10 percent of ticks in southern Sweden carry
the bacteria.

[Anaplasmataceae is a family of Gram negative, obligate intracellular
alphaproteobacteria that consists of 6 genetically distinct genera: 1)
_Ehrlichia_, _Anaplasma_, and _Neorickettsia_; 2) _Wolbachia_ and
_Aegyptianella_, which only infect nematodes, arthropods, or birds;
and 3) the newly proposed genus _Candidatus Neoehrlichia_
(http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/reprint/48/7/2630). _Candidatus_ is the term
used for an interim taxonomic status of noncultivable prokaryotic
organisms. _Neoehrlichia_ refers to a new _Ehrlichia_; _mikurensis_
refers to Mikura Island in southern Japan, where the organism was
discovered (http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/54/5/1837.long).

_Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis _ recently was discovered in ticks
and wild rodents in East Asia (Japan, China, Russia) and Europe
(Sweden, Italy, Netherlands, Germany)
(http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/content/full/48/7/2630). A closely related
but distinct species, _Candidatus N. lotoris_, was found in raccoons
in North America (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16428872).
Experimental infection with _Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis_ in
rats did not elicit antibodies against _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ and
_Ehrlichia muris_ antigens
(http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/54/5/1837.long), which further
support the position that _Candidatus Neoehrlichia_ is a separate
genus.

_Candidatus N. mikurensis_ has been identified by PCR amplification of
its 16S rRNA gene in at least 4 humans in Europe with febrile
illnesses that was associated with thrombotic or hemorrhagic events.
Several of the infected patients have been immunocompromised
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20220155,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20519481, and
