The recent cluster of human monkeypox cases is in a remote area of Zaire.
Monkeypox is a very rare zoonotic infection that generally occurs in foci
like the present episode. Local measures to interrupt disease transmission
which are ongoing include education of health-care providers and
distribution of health messages, such as limiting contact with wild-caught
animals and restricting contact with suspected cases to a single person
(preferably the oldest member of the household who has either recovered
from monkeypox or has a "vaccinia" vaccination scar). The World Health
Organization is considering returning to the region, as the political
situation permits, to conduct studies to determine the need for additional
risk-reduction measures. At the present time there is no data to support
the use of "vaccinia" vaccine for persons traveling to West and Central
Africa. The current recommendation of the U.S. Immunization Practices
Advisory Committee is to vaccinate only laboratory and health-care
workers who directly handle human orthopoxvirus (monkeypox, cowpox,
vaccinia) infectious material.
