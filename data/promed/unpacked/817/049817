Avian influenza Â– update: situation in Viet Nam
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_09_07/en/>

WHO has received informal reports of a laboratory-confirmed fatal case of
influenza A H5 infection in Viet Nam. The patient is thought to be a child
who was hospitalized in Hanoi and who died over the weekend. Further details
are awaited from official sources.
Detection of an H5 subtype of influenza A in a human should always arouse a
very high level of suspicion that the case was caused by the H5N1 strain of
avian influenza, particularly in a country with ongoing outbreaks of H5N1 in
poultry. H5N1 is the only strain within the H5 subtype that has ever been
shown to cause disease in humans.
Since August [2004], Viet Nam has detected 4 human cases of H5 infection.
These cases have occurred amidst recurring H5N1 outbreaks in poultry in
several Asian countries.
Since January of this year [2004], altogether 39 human cases have been
reported from 2 countries, Viet Nam and Thailand. Of these cases, 28 have
been fatal.

Suspected bird flu claims baby's life in Viet Nam
-------------------------------------------------
A 14-month-old baby boy in Viet Nam has died from suspected bird flu.
The baby, who was hospitalised in Hanoi on 28 Aug 2004 and then transferred
to the Central Paediatric Hospital for specialist care, died on Sunday, said
Nguyen Duc Long, deputy director of the Ministry of Health's legal
department. "The baby tested positive for Type A H5 virus, but this is not
bird flu," he told AFP. However, Hans Troedsson, the World Health
Organization's (WHO) representative in Viet Nam, said it was "highly likely"
that the child's death was caused by bird flu. "We suspect that H5N1 was
responsible but we need to investigate it further," he told AFP. The baby and
his family lived near a market in Hanoi's Thanh Tri district, according to
state media.
The WHO fears that the H5N1 strain, which can pass from infected poultry to
humans, could mutate into a highly contagious form that triggers the next
global human flu pandemic.
Officials from Viet Nam's Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, the
organization charged with carrying out tests for H5N1 on suspected victims in
the northern half of the country, could not be contacted for comment.
3 people, including 2 children, died last month [August 2004] after being
infected with the virus. Prior to this, Viet Nam's last confirmed death from
bird flu was that of a 12-year-old boy who died on 15 Mar 2004.
Bui Quang Anh, agriculture ministry spokesman, admitted last week that
mistakes had been made in tackling the disease, which has resulted in the
deaths or culling of more than 44 million poultry since late [2003]. "In
March [2004] we declared that we were free of bird flu," he told
reporters. "At that time we didn't have enough information and we weren't
experienced enough." However, he stressed that the outbreaks that have been
reported in 13 provinces across the country since then have been brought
under control and that the government would remain on alert.
