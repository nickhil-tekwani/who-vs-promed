[There are several stories about food safety in the new issue of U.S. News
and World Report, including a [picture of a dead calf on the cover. The
first story begins at Heyer Hills Farm, in Franklin County, Vt., 50 miles
south of Canada. Cynthia Hawley of the farm was cited as saying [that one
day she noticed a sick calf; by the time the vet arrived in the afternoon,
all the calves were running high fevers. The first calf died that evening.
By the next day, all the calves had bloody diarrhea, a sign that bacteria
were destroying their intestinal walls. In the vet's experience, cows fought
off _Salmonella_ on their own, just as most healthy people do. But these
animals weren't fighting it off. And the odd thing was that the antibiotic
wasn't working either. An autopsy on the second calf that died revealed
massive damage to the lining of the intestine confirming _Salmonella_ [of
course, this confirmation would require a positive culture -Mod.ES.
The vet suggested that the young grandchildren be kept away from the barn.
But, like many dairy farmers, the Heyers drank their own, unpasteurized
milk. They'd never had a problem with contamination at the farm before; why
should their raw milk be unsafe now? Within days, nine members of the family
would fall ill, and one would nearly lose her life.
The pathogen was eventually identified as _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104,
identifiable by its resistance to five or more antibiotics including
ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline.
The story also described the heart of the CDC's operation as the electronic
network it has built with local health departments in every state. The
health departments feed raw numbers to the CDC weekly. The public hears
about _Salmonella_ or _E. coli_ [infections when large numbers of people
[are already hospitalized. But most foodborne illnesses are not associated
with large outbreaks. They are "sporadic" or isolated cases among
individuals that may never be reported to health departments or the CDC. The
CDC estimates that for every reported case, 10 to 100 go uncounted.
The story also describes how epidemiologist Frederick Angulo had watched
_Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104 sweep through Germany, Denmark, England, and
Wales, eventually emerging in the United States. [This pathogen was
identified in [the US in 1985. By last spring, when the Heyers were trying
to save their dying calves, Angulo had discovered that 10 percent of all
_Salmonella_ cultures being sent to the CDC were the DT 104 strain. He knew
of only one large US outbreak, among 19 Nebraska schoolchildren in October
1996. The source was never determined.
In England, _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104 already had become epidemic. It
was killing 40 percent of infected cattle and putting 36 percent of people
who became sick in the hospital, twice the number expected from food
poisonings.
Angulo was cited as saying that in the United States, he knew _Salmonella
typhimurium_ DT 104 had already been found in sheep, pigs, horses, goats,
cats, dogs, elk, mice, coyotes, squirrels, raccoons, chipmunks, pigeons, and
starlings. The birds were a real concern because their droppings spread
disease everywhere.
USDA microbiologist Paula Fedorka-Cray was quoted as saying if it's in birds
"it would just be a matter of time before it would show up in a lot of
animal species." There was some evidence in England that _Salmonella
typhimurium_ DT 104 had first infected exotic birds, parrots, and parakeets,
which had spread the infection to cattle through feed.
The English experience with _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104 is notable for
several reasons. Ten years ago, the bacteria began infecting cattle and
killed many of them. Farmers in the UK treated infected cattle with several
types of antibiotics. Within about two years, the bacteria became resistant
to the antibiotics. The first humans infected in the UK were like the
Heyers, dairy farmers who had direct contact with sick animals and drank
their own raw milk. But the bacteria soon moved into other food animals.
The story says how Hawley's doctor gave her a fluoroquinolone called
ofloxacin, because the only drug _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104 was clearly
not resistant to was a powerful class of new antibiotics called
fluoroquinolones, "the drug of last resort."
The story says that when _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104 struck cattle in
the UK, farmers used Bactrim to treat them; since 1993, they have used
fluoroquinolones. By 1995, 14 percent of DT 104 strains in the UK had become
resistant to fluoroquinolones and nearly 30 percent had developed resistance
to trimethoprim, the agent in Bactrim that kills _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT
104 [of course, Bactrim is a combination of sulfamethoxazole and
trimethoprim, two agents that act synergistically to inhibit folate
metabolism in bacteria - Mod.ES. Patrick Wall, chief of gastrointestinal
disease at the Public Health Service Laboratory in London, was cited as
recounting how last year some turkeys were put on fluoroquinolone drugs by a
farmer in England who feared a respiratory disease would make them ill and
unsalable. But a large number of these turkeys ended up with multiresistant
_Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104 infections that were also resistant to
fluoroquinolones.
By the end of the Vermont outbreak in June, 22 of the 147 cows at Heyer
Hills had become ill and 13 had died. 17 other cows had positive _Salmonella
typhimurium_ DT 104 cultures. Three of the family's six dogs were positive,
too, but did not fall ill. The bulk milk tank filter was cultured on two
occasions, one week apart; both samples were positive. Ninety percent of
family members who drank raw milk became ill.

[Robert kindly summarized even more of this report than I decided to post.
If you want more media based information, I suggest you pick up the magazine
and read the whole story. However, if the UK experience is any guide, we
will be hearing more about _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104 not only in the
States but elsewhere. - Mod.PC
