Health alert as dengue fever rages in Pacific
---------------------------------------------
Dengue fever is scorching through the Pacific Islands, with Fiji
reporting nearly 2000 cases and American Samoa reporting a year's
supply of cases last month [September 2008] alone.

Samoa, Tonga, New Caledonia, Kiribati, and Palau are also reporting
unusually high levels of the virus [infection].

Dengue fever [virus], transmitted to humans through mosquito bites,
is severely painful, debilitating, and at times deadly.

The outbreak has swept across Fiji in recent weeks. The central
region, with almost 1300 cases, and the west are worst hit.

Health authorities in American Samoa say the virus has killed a
10-year-old boy and affected almost 200 so far this year [2008]. Most
of those cases have occurred in the past 6 weeks. Last year [2007]
the nation had 109 cases.

Dengue fever outbreaks tended to come and go in the Pacific, said Dr
Teuila Percival of Auckland University's Pacific Health Research Centre.

[More than 500 people have been diagnosed in Samoa, at least 1000 in
both New Caledonia and Fiji and close to 900 in Kiribati according to
the Fiji Times of 18 Oct 2008
(<http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=103700>). This article
indicates that researchers believe the real number is at least double
these figures because so many people do not seek, or cannot reach,
medical help.

The community was asked to take part in eradicating _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes.

Dengue fever has increasingly raged in Aceh, up until mid-October
2008. It has been reported that a total of 13 Acehnese residents died
because of the illness caused by the bite of _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes [that transmit dengue virus].

According to Kadis Kesehatan NAD, Dr TM Thaib SP.A, M Kes, Acehnese
Utara was one of the areas that became endemic for dengue in Aceh
including Banda Aceh and Acehnese Besar.

Because of this, all the communities in the Province of Nanggroe Aceh
Darussalam, especially in 3 serious dengue-affected regencies, were
asked to anticipate the dengue danger, especially in the coming rainy season.

"We appealed to residents to clean and watch the environment ," said
Thaib to the reporter in Banda Aceh, on Saturday (18 Oct [2008]). He
said that eradication of the mosquitoes not only was carried out with
fogging or fumigation, but also with the active role of the community
by cleaning their respective environment routinely. The mosquito
_Aedes aegypti_, the dengue virus vector, breeds in wet places like
baths, dispensers, refrigerators, and flowerpots in the homes, in
addition to tins and 2nd-hand tyres.

From the Health Service data of the Province, dengue cases in
Lhokseumawe reached 480 with 3 deaths. Generally, the [cohort] that
was most attacked was children.

Not only Lhokseumawe, but Aceh North also was reported as an area
that often had fatalities resulting from dengue. Aceh North had 3
residents who died resulting from dengue up till September 2008.

So far in 2008, Banda Aceh has had 392 [dengue] cases, including 2
deaths. In detail in Banda Aceh, 60 cases were recorded in January,
48 cases in February, 44 cases in March, 35 cases in April, 49 cases
in May, 26 cases in June, 33 cases in July, 38 cases in August, and
37 cases in September. [Note, the sum of cases mentioned during the
period January through September 2008 is 370 cases, whereas the total
for Banda Aceh as of the writing of the newswire on 19 Oct 2008 was
392. It is possible that the 22 case discrepancy is a function of
preliminary reports for the month of October through 19 Oct 2008. -

The Regional Government from Banda Aceh proclaimed the PSN movement
in August 2008. For the village community, the PSN movement takes
place every week for the government agencies and the schools on
Friday. (Note: PSN is the name of the community activity to destroy
mosquito-breeding sites)

Because of this, the Section Head of the Banda Aceh Health Service,
Dr Media Yulizar appealed to all residents to make time for one hour
in a week to clean their respective houses, so as to not provide
breeding sites for mosquitoes that are the virus vectors.

Without active participation of the community, it is difficult to
combat dengue, moreover the Banda Aceh city is one of the endemic
areas for dengue virus in Aceh," said Dr Media.

[In an article in the 18 Oct 2008 issue of Metro TV News
(<http://www.metrotvnews.com/berita.asp?id=68779>), it was reported
that in last 3 days the local Health Service recorded an increase in
dengue cases to 47, including 2 deaths. The number of cases of dengue
fever in Lhokseumawe this year (2008) was the highest in the last 3
years. Lhokseumawe has now been declared as an area of extraordinary
dengue fever incidence.

Chikungunya, dengue, and Japanese encephalitis have affected at least
300 people in West Bengal in the last 8 days, killing 3 people,
health authorities said Thursday [16 Oct 2008]. [The article does not
indicate how many of the 300 people and 3 fatalities were due to the
specific virus infections cited, although 2 deaths were attributed to
dengue. - Mod.TY]

"We have detected dengue and chikungunya viruses [viruses, or
antibodies to the viruses? - Mod.TY] in blood samples of about 250
people since 9 Oct [2008]," district chief medical officer (health)
of South 24 Parganas Sachchidananda Sarkar said.

[Dengue, chikungunya, and Japanese encephalitis viruses (JEV) have
all hit West Bengal. Dengue and chikungunya viruses are transmitted
by the same _Aedes_ mosquito vector, most likely _Ae. aegypti_. JEV
is transmitted by _Culex_ spp., which makes timely vector control for
all 3 viruses challenging for public health authorities.

Yunnan confirmed 68 cases of dengue fever; epidemic has been brought
under control
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A reporter from City Times learned from the relevant departments
yesterday [15 Oct 2008] that as of [14 Oct 2008], Yunnan Province has
reported 68 cases of dengue fever, of which 48 cases were imported
cases, mainly from Dehong, Lincang, and Xishuangbanna located near
the China Myanmar border.

Currently, no deaths because of dengue fever have been reported. The
staff from Yunnan Center for Disease Control said that although the
province's epidemic situation is very severe, the epidemic has been
brought under control because the departments of health and epidemic
prevention have taken effective control measures and most of the
cases were imported.

[Of the 68 cases of dengue fever reported in Yunnan province, 48
cases were described as imported cases and the disease distribution
was mainly near the China Myanmar border. Thus, it can be assumed
that some of the cases of dengue fever may have been imported from Myanmar.

Viet Nam has been reporting the dengue fever activity recently.
Recurrence of dengue fever in Nghe An province resulted in 687 cases
reported as of 14 Oct 2008 (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet
Nam (15): Nghe An 20081014.3250).

For a map of China with provinces, see
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/china_pol01.jpg>.
Yunnan is the most southwestern province in China and it borders
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Guizhou Province in the east,
Sichuan Province in the north, and Tibet Autonomous Region in the
northwest. It shares a border with Myanmar in the west, Laos in the
south, and Viet Nam in the southeast.

outbreaks in China and surrounding countries that have been reported
on ProMED-mail. The postings can be directly accessed through this

If the outbreak is situated near the China Myanmar border, one
wonders if there has been an increase in dengue activity in Myanmar
near the border with China. The last reports on dengue activity in
Myanmar posted on PRO/MBDS were in the end of July 2008 and were
associated with discussion on the post cyclone Nargis health impacts
(see PRO/MBDS Post cyclone situation - Myanmar (05): dengue
20080730.2321 and Post cyclone situation - Myanmar (04): dengue
20080708.2077. - Mod.MPP]
