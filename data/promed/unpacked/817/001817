[Now that increasing numbers of West Nile cases are being reported in
the northern tier of states in the USA, it is not surprising that
cases are beginning to appear in the Canadian provinces to the north
of those states. - Mod.TY]

* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN encephalitis,
meningitis* and myelitis)
** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion.
*** Cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided.
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.

Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.

West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and therefore it is optional
whether or not state health departments report these cases to CDC.
Click the above CDC site for further explanations of neuroinvasive
West Nile virus disease and West Nile fever.

Other Clinical includes persons with clinical manifestations other
than WN fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute
flaccid paralysis. Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient
clinical information was not provided.

Total Human Cases Reported to CDC: These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2006 that have
been reported to ArboNet by state and local health departments.
ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance system established
by CDC to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and other
mosquito-borne viruses. Information regarding 2006 virus/disease
activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.

[Although a WNV-positive mosquito was reported last week [1 Aug
2006]from Washington, D.C. in the popular press
(<http://www.thecommondenominator.com/080106_update1.html>), it does
not appear in this CDC update. ProMED requests additional
information from either CDC or from the Washington, D.C. Health
Department to confirm this earlier report. - Mod.TY]
