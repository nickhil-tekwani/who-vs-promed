Legionnaires' disease in Australia
-------------------------------
The Human Services Department, Public Health Division of the Government of
Victoria, Australia has confirmed 66 cases, including 2 deaths. All the
patients, with one exception, had visited the Melbourne Aquarium after 11
Apr 2000. Laboratory results for all the cases show _Legionnella
pneumophila_ serogroup 1. Test results are pending on a further number of
patients who had been to the aquarium and had developed respiratory illness
symptoms.
Laboratory test results have also confirmed the presence of _Legionella_
bacteria in the cooling towers of the Melbourne Aquarium, which were
immediately disinfected. The health authorities have set up a Legionnaires'
disease hotline to provide advice and continue to investigate the outbreak.

Positive test results on aquarium towers (4 May 2000)
------------------------------------------------------
Laboratory test results have confirmed the presence of _Legionella_
bacteria in the cooling towers of the Melbourne Aquarium at the time
Australia's largest-ever outbreak of Legionnaires' Disease came to light
last month. The Communicable Diseases Manager of the Human Services
Department, Dr John Carnie, said bacteria cultures from the samples taken
from the towers on 27 Apr 2000 had been grown in a laboratory for the past
week, and the presence of _Legionella_.
Sixty-six people have now been confirmed with the disease, including two
women who have died. Dr Carnie said the epidemiological evidence had
established a strong link with the aquarium, with all but one of the
affected people having visited it in the period before the outbreak. The
other person walked past. He said the laboratory results received today
backed up the epidemiological evidence, and the Department was now
satisfied as to the source of the Legionnaires' Disease.
The results show _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 - the same type which
affected all the patients. "Department scientists will take weekly samples
from the aquarium cooling towers for analysis until we are satisfied that
any problems have been rectified," Dr Carnie said. He said nine of the 66
patients confirmed with the disease were in a critical condition in hospital.
The Department is awaiting test results on a further 41 people who had been
to the aquarium and who have developed respiratory illness symptoms. They
include two patients from Queensland, two from New Zealand, three from NSW,
one from the United States, four from Tasmania and one from the United
Kingdom. "We would expect the number of cases from this outbreak to start
tapering off now," Dr Carnie said. "The cooling towers were disinfected
immediately the aquarium was identified as the likely cause of the outbreak
on 27 Apr 2000. The incubation period for this illness is from two to 10
days, so most people who could have been infected should have shown up by now.

The recent posting on the Legionnaire's outbreak may be misleading. The
posting reports that the colony count on the suspect water tower rose by
400% (from <1000 cfu/ml, to about 40 000 cfu/ml) around the period of the
outbreak. The aquarium's biological consultant comments that this is well
below the allowable limit of 500 000 cfu/ml.
The way the story is written (the posting comes from an edited newspaper
article) implies that these counts refer to the number of _Legionella_
organisms present. This is almost definitely not the case, and it is most
likely that these counts refer to the total bacterial counts.
