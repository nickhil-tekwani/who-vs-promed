Date: 7 May 2000
From: Debora MacKenzie <d.mackenzie@chello.be>

The peer-reviewed source of the observations of hepatitis B in chimpanzees
was the Journal of Virology (73:7860 and 74:4253). The BBC report cited in
the ProMED-mail posting was based on an article by one of my colleagues at
New Scientist, which is accessible at
