BSE AND TRANSMISSIBLE MINK ENCEPHALOPATHY (3)
=============================================

replied. MHJ-]

Hello Martin,
Similarities & differences:
well there are some simple ones. You know:-)
Species: TME is a mink disease, BSE a cow disease.
Epidemiology: TME:
i.
infrequent and sporadic outbreaks since 1947
in a number of mink herds (in USA),
no systematic epidemiological
studies have been possible.
ii.
may affect a major part of the affected herd ('wipe out')
BSE:
i.one major outbreak since 1985 in >33000 (in UK), with
reasonably well studied epidemiology.
ii.
affects only a minor part of the affected herd
Supposed vector for causative agent: Both TME and BSE seem to be
be spread with feed.
Supposed causative agent: Both TME and BSE are thought to be prion diseases.

Incubation time:
TME: <1 year
BSE: >2 years, typically 3-4 years
Typical clinical signs of disease:
TME: tail curling, scattering of faeces, hyperaggressivenes, excitability.
BSE: Apprehension, paranoid/aggressive behaviour, uncoordinated gait
Main location for degenerative lesions seen in brain differ:
TME: cerebrocortical and midbrain
BSE: brain stem

>2.
>Has any work post-Marsh been done on TME in this regard?
AFAIK, Marsh has not published anything regarding TME since being
the coauthor of the Robinson et.al. 1995 study:
"Experimental infection of cattle with the agents of
transmissible mink encephalopathy and scrapie."
(Journ. of comparative Pathology, 1995,113,3, 241-25).
And no other studies on TME seem to have been published since then.

>3. What are the similarities and differences between TME,
> scrapie, and BSE and even CJD prions?
It is highly likely that prion protein from mink, sheep, cows and man
after post-translational modifications are very similar in tertiary
structure, and they must have identical physiological role in
the nervous system.
'prions' i.e. certain protease resistant fragments of prion protein,
supposed by definition to be able to precipitate brain degeneration
after being transmitted to the brain of another animal.
According to the theory, new prions are produced in the recipient
animal during the degeneration. These 'secondary' prions do not necessarily
resemble the prions inoculated. The theory has it that the production
of these secondary prions are the cause of the brain degeneration.
(IMO: It could be the other way around. In that case it would be necessary
to answer the question: what causes the brain degeneration, if it
is not the prions?
It would be interesting to study the effect of intracerebral
injection of brain material from a chemically induced
spongiform encephalopathy (CPZ treated mice, HCP- or TET-treated rats)
-- another IMO: The phrase 'TME prions' should only be used
to signify prions from a mink with TME. If material from such a
TME case is used to transmit disease to another species it is
'something else', also 'strains' have been shown to be able
to diverge during several passages (i.e. in TME the RY and
the GY strain from third passage through syrian hamster.)
This quickly becomes complicated/confusing, but experiments where the donor
species is varied, while the same recipient species is used has
given some insight. To make sense, there *has* to be a limited
number of different types or 'strains' of prions.
IMO: The >16? strains of scrapie sounds like a mad man's dream!
The following quote seems to suggest two general types:
"The characterisation of isolates of spongiform encephalopathies from
a range of natural and experimental sources, by transmission to mice,
has continued. Transmissions of scrapie-like disease from kudu,
nyala and cats have already given closely similar results to BSE,
suggesting a common infection source. This also shows that the
donor species has little effect on disease characteristics in mice.
In contrast, the transmission characteristics of natural sheep scrapie,
chronic wasting disease of mule deer, TME and cow-passaged TME differ from
those of BSE, suggesting that different strains of agent are involved."
"Transmissions from two 'negative line' Cheviot sheep, intracerebrally
or orally infected with BSE, and from a goat, intracerebrally infected
with BSE, have given similar results to cattle BSE. However, two
further sources, a 'positive line' Cheviot and a goat, both orally infected
with BSE, are unlike BSE when transmitted to mice.
Either the donor animals were infected with natural scrapie or
passage of BSE through these individuals had selected a new strain."
(Quote from report of ongoing research IAH, UK -
http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/institut/public/3wtse.htm)
Also the Robinson et al. study "Experimental infection of mink with
bovine spongiform encephalopathy"
(Journal of General Virology (1994), 75, 2151-2155, demonstrates
a difference between the lesions and symptoms in mink after
inoculation of BSE material, and the lesions and symptoms in
natural/experimental TME.
This is about what I can give you as a response to your
questions Martin, I hope it is useful. You are welcome
to come back with further questions. Please remember
that I am *not* an expert, just a bl.... amateur.
You may post this, if you think it is worthy. I am a subscriber
to PROMED-digest, so I can read and learn from things
corrected or added by follow-up's.
Kind regards,
