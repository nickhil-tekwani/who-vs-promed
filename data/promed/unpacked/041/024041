[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 935 616 with 81 589 (8.7%) cases reported by China. There are now a total of 854 027 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 207 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 76 876 cases when compared with the data on 31 Mar 2020, with the USA accounting for 26 551 (34.5%), Italy for 4782 (6.2%), Spain for 8195 (10.7%), and Germany for 6173 (8.0%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 91.3% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 23.0% of the global cases of COVID-19. The USA, Italy, and Spain have overtaken China in total numbers of cases and Germany may pass China in 1-2 days. A global total of 47 226 deaths have been reported, 43 910 (93.0%) outside mainland China.

It is now clear that while China has the largest population in the world, and was the original location where the COVID-19 outbreak started, it has markedly reduced transmission to a manageable level, now monitoring all arrivals in the country from outside. South Korea has slowly decreased daily, new case counts hovering around 100 in recent days. The USA is now number one outside China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19, Italy is number 2, and Spain is number 3. Iran has slowed down in growth rate and Spain and Turkey have been accelerating. To get an understanding of how rapidly things increase, look at Turkey. The 1st confirmed case was reported on 11 Mar 2020 and in 21 days the country has confirmed 15 679 cases and it now ranks number 10 out of 206 countries/territories in terms of absolute numbers of confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

Abridged and edited/summarized from a 10-minute interview:

We look now at a COVID-19 success story. Taiwan is just off the coast of mainland China. Millions travel between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland. Johns Hopkins University predicted Taiwan would have the 2nd most COVID-19 cases in the world. But, today [1 Apr 2020], there are 80 countries and territories with more than Taiwan's 329 cases.

Taiwan is only 80 miles [about 50 mi] off the coast of mainland China. When Johns Hopkins modeled COVID-19, it predicted Taiwan would have the 2nd highest number of cases. That prediction didn't become reality. Taiwan has succeeded at containing COVID-19 starting at arrival.

A Taiwanese returning to Taiwan from the UK: on arrival, she was given a form to monitor her temperature in the next 14 days. [She] told authorities she'd had a cough in the last 2 weeks, so security escorted her to secondary screening. She had her temperature taken and she filled out forms consenting to new regulations and providing recent medical history. And she got a COVID-19 test at the airport. Taiwan uploads these results into its national healthcare database to create a kind of coronavirus database that everyone has to enrol in.

They have to register first online. They are sent a text message that has to be shown on arrival at the airport. But that's where government tracking begins. After her bags are disinfected, her ride home is by herself in a government-provided taxi. She is not permitted to take public transport. The government stays in touch during a mandatory 2-week quarantine.

[Another returning Taiwanese who arrived from Australia on 22 Mar 2020] said that on the 1st day, they immediately phoned him, almost within the hour he arrived home in addition to several text messages. "Welcome back to Taiwan. This is the CDC. We're just checking to see if you're OK."

Everyone who arrives in Taiwan today is tracked by cell phone to make sure they stay at home. Taiwan's Center for Disease Control tries to make the 14-day quarantine easy. Someone from CDC verified where he lived and arrived within 4 minutes. He was given a packet of masks, 14 masks in the packet exactly,1 for each day of quarantine.

Taiwan was able to take all of these steps because it learned lessons the hard way. The SARS outbreak was a wake-up call for Taiwan, and they learned a lot from it. Dr Steve Kuo is the former head of Taiwan's CDC and led the SARS taskforce in 2003 when the SARS epidemic made hundreds of Taiwanese sick and killed more than 70, the 3rd highest tally in the world. The very next year [2004], authorities prepared for the next crisis. That preparation allowed Taiwan's CDC to detect the COVID-19 threat before the Chinese government announced it.

They picked up the signal that there was some strange outbreak in the Wuhan area at the end of the last year [2019] from social media networks. They sent 2 medical doctors to Wuhan from Taiwan CDC to get a better understanding of what happened there, and 5 days later, on 20 Jan 2020, the government decided immediately to set up and activate the central command centers.

That centralized command center launched border restrictions before almost anyone else, set local quarantine rules, and turned to technology. One phone app allows Taiwan residents to find stores with masks in stock. Another app provides information on all of those who are COVID-19 positive, where they have been, and their case history. And the government made sure it had enough medical equipment.

After the SARS outbreak, there was a law to require hospitals to have a stockpile of all medical supplies for 30 days.

Today [1 Apr 2020], Taiwan announced that it would donate 10 million masks to medical workers around the world, 2 million to the US.

[Reviewing the Taiwanese experience with the COVID-19 pandemic up to the present is a testimony to "doing it right". From the start, the Taiwanese took the approach of containment, complete contact tracing, and quarantine with active monitoring. So far it seems to have worked. One can safely say that so far they have managed to hold off large outbreaks for 3 months, knowing that it could very quickly happen. It is a lesson to be learned in how to address a potential pandemic organism. And as a not so small note, it was Taiwanese colleagues who alerted us to the Weibo chatter on the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan on 30 Dec 2019, which led to our 1st post on the subject. - Mod.MPP

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET

Highlights
----------
- Three new countries/territories/areas reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours: Botswana, Burundi, and Sierra Leone.

- WHO has released a scientific brief on the off-label use of medicines for COVID-19. A number of medicines have been suggested as potential investigational therapies, many of which are now being or will soon be studied in clinical trials, including the SOLIDARITY trial co-sponsored by WHO and participating countries. More information can be found at https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/off-label-use-of-medicines-for-covid-19.

- WHO recognizes the importance of addressing the needs of refugees and migrants when preparing for or responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO European Region has released a guidance document to assist healthcare working with refugees and migrants. More information can be found at http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/news/news/2020/3/measures-against-covid-19-need-to-include-refugees-and-migrants.

- At a press briefing, yesterday [31 Mar 2020], PAHO director Dr Carissa Etienne stressed that countries of the Americas must act now to slow the spread of COVID-19. WHO encourages countries to prepare hospitals and health facilities, protect their health personnel, and decide what social distancing measures need to be implemented and for how long, among other actions.

- Public health and social measures to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19 must be implemented with the full engagement of all members of society. WHO has described 4 levels of COVID-19 transmission with varying public health and social measures depending on the local evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. For more details, please see 'subject in focus' section below.

Subject in focus: public health and social measures for the COVID-19 pandemic
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this note is to outline public health and social measures useful for slowing or stopping the spread of COVID-19 at national or community level. Guidance for case finding and management, personal and environmental measures, travel measures, and mass gatherings is available on the WHO website available athttps://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance.

Public health and social measures are measures or actions by individuals, institutions, communities, local and national governments and international bodies to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19. These measures to reduce transmission of COVID-19 include individual and environmental measures, detecting and isolating cases, contact-tracing and quarantine, social and physical distancing measures including for mass gatherings, international travel measures, and vaccines and treatments. While vaccines and specific medications are not yet available for COVID-19, other public health and social measures play an essential role in reducing the number of infections and saving lives.

Social and physical distancing measures aim to slow the spread of disease by stopping chains of transmission of COVID-19 and preventing new ones from appearing. These measures secure physical distance between people (of at least one metre/3 ft), and reduce contact with contaminated surfaces while encouraging and sustaining virtual social connection within families and communities. Measures for the general public include introducing flexible work arrangements such as teleworking, distance learning, reducing and avoiding crowding, closure of non-essential facilities and services, shielding and protection for vulnerable groups, local or national movement restrictions and staying-at home measures, and coordinated reorganization of health care and social services networks to protect hospitals. The measures are used in conjunction with individual protective measures against COVID-19 such as frequent handwashing and cough etiquette.

All public health measures to stop disease spread can be balanced with adaptive strategies to encourage community resilience and social connection, protect incomes, and secure the food supply. Countries should balance the possible benefits and negative consequences of each intervention and deploy strategies to encourage community engagement, gain trust, and limit social or economic harm. There are many strategies that can support community resilience and mental health, protect access to essential goods and services, and limit the economic impact of stay-at-home measures where these are deemed necessary. For example, organizing work-sites to ensure physical distance between persons, such as staggering shifts over time, or converting on-site service to home delivery may help to keep more businesses open. Tele-working and tele-schooling strategies in different contexts demonstrate innovation and the role of technology in supporting business continuity and sustaining social connection within families and communities. In general, implementation of distancing measures should also aim to sustain personal and professional community connections by virtual means and technology, including widely accessible means such as radio and mobile phones.

Alongside all these measures remains there is the critical to test all suspected cases of COVID-19 wherever possible, promptly isolate cases, trace contacts to the widest extent possible, and ensure quarantine of contacts for the duration of the incubation period. This goes for any context or level of spread of the pandemic in a country, in order to deepen the benefits of social measures. Social measures should make the task of contact tracing much easier as the number of contacts rapidly dwindles and eventually the number of cases declines as well. As social measures are lifted, it is essential to continue to strengthen case-finding, isolation for COVID-19 cases and quarantine of contacts, in order to respond to resurgent or imported cases. Coordinated reorganization of health and social services is essential to assess and test persons rapidly, treat patients effectively, and protect hospitals and health personnel.

WHO has described 4 levels of COVID-19 transmission. These are countries or local areas with:
1. No cases reported.
2. Sporadic cases.
3. Clusters of cases (grouped in place and time), or
4. Community transmission.

Countries are putting in place a range of public health and social measures in different combinations and at varying times in the local evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. The alignment of public health measures to levels of transmission in a community is not fixed in stone. Countries may wish to specify which measures are to be taken at each level and review the situation regularly. A package of measures may be applied at local, regional, or national levels and adjusted as needed, considering aspects such as culture, living environments, terrain, and access to needed resources. Essential services should remain operational and governments should put in place social and economic policies to limit the longer term economic impact, support community resilience, and enable rapid recovery. Most importantly, the ultimate aim is to 'walk back' community transmission to clusters, sporadic cases, and down to no cases at all, and to begin gradually lifting social measures as soon as it is safe to do so. Guidance for lifting measures is being developed.

To be effective, public health measures must be implemented with the full engagement of all members of society, including communities and professional groups. All measures should be accompanied by clear, accessible and regular risk communication to explain the response strategy and enable people to make informed decisions to protect themselves and help achieve the public health goal of ending the outbreak.

A table summarizing public health and social measures to support control of COVID-19 will be available shortly at http://www.who.int/epi-win.

These data come from Table 1: Countries, territories or areas with reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Data as of [10:00 AM 1 Apr 2020], available at the source URL above.

- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China now totals 204. This includes 18 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 21 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 51 countries (including 16 territories) from the Americas region, and 44 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 25 737 new cases (in the past 24 hours) of which 87.7% were reported by the USA, followed by Canada (5.4%) and Brazil (1.3%). The European region continues with rapid transmission, having confirmed 40 266 (55.4%) new cases and 3395 (81.1%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, with Italy accounting for 10.1% of newly confirmed cases, Spain for 16.3% of newly confirmed cases, Germany for 13.5% of newly confirmed cases, and France for 18.6% of newly confirmed cases (bringing the total of these 4 countries accounting for 58.6% of newly confirmed cases in Europe, down from 62.3% yesterday (31 Mar 2020). In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 3111 new cases representing 79.1% of the regional newly reported cases. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar represent 4.4%, 2.8%, and 2.2% respectively. In the African region, Algeria reported 25.4% of the newly reported cases in the past 24 hours and South Africa and Burkina Faso reported 9.4% and 5.2% respectively of the newly reported cases in the region. In the Western Pacific region, The Philippines reported 36.6% of the newly confirmed cases followed by Australia at 23.7%; Japan reported 15.3% of the total (excluding China), followed by Malaysia with 9.5%. In South East Asia, India reported 58.9% of the newly reported cases followed by Thailand with 25.7% and Indonesia with 11.9%, but a caution as only Indonesia and Myanmar reported newly confirmed cases yesterday (31 Mar 2020).

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [1 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve showed a lowering probably related to inconsistent reporting over the weekend and one suspects it is rebounding with today's reports.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
