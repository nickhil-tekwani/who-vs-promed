First report of pathogenic association between _Fusarium graminearum_ and
soybean
--------------------------------------
RN Pioli, L Mozzoni, EN Morandi, Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias, University
Nacional Rosario, PO 14, 2123 Zavalla, Santa Fe, Argentina. Plant Dis 2004;
88: 220, published online as D-2003-1119-01N, 2004. Accepted for
publication 27 Oct 2003.
_Fusarium graminearum_, a pathogen of wheat and corn, was reported recently
as a saprophytic fungus colonizing soybean (_Glycine max_ L. _Merr._)
fruits and seeds at R7 in Argentina (1).
To evaluate the capacity of _F. graminearum_ obtained from stem and seeds
of symptomatic soybean plants that cause disease on soybean seedlings,
isolates were obtained during the 2001 to 2002 growing season from: (i) the
basal 1/3 of stems from field-grown soybean plants, collected at R5, with
light brown external and internal discoloration and leaves with interveinal
chlorosis; and (ii) soybean seeds with pink tegument.
The pathogen was isolated on potato glucose agar acidified with 0.2 per
cent lactic acid (PGAA). Isolates were identified as _F. graminearum_ on
the basis of growth rate and pigmentation of colonies on PGAA, lack of
microconidia (2), and morphology and size of typical macroconidia in
sporodochia developed on Spezieller Nahrstoffarmer Agar (3). Isolates of
_F. graminearum_, CE135 and CE136 (from wheat) and CE137 (from corn)
deposited in the Centro de Referencia en Micologia (CEREMIC), Fac. Farmacia
y Bioquimica, UNR, Argentina, were used as references in identifying the
soybean isolates.
Plants (14 day old) were inoculated separately with stem and seed isolates
in the greenhouse at 26 ± 2 and 20 ± 2 deg C day/night temperature by
inserting a piece of mycelium into a wound made with a scalpel in the
hypocotyl. A completely randomized block design (RCB) was utilized with 4
replicate pots with 4 plants per pot. Plants wounded but without mycelium
served as controls. This test was conducted twice (experiments 1 and 2).
Another test was completed by burying a thin layer of wheat caryopsis
colonized by fungal mycelium of the stem isolate CE170 in the soil of pots.
Plants in pots with soil without inoculum served as controls (4). The
experiment was conducted twice (experiments 3 and 4) in an RCB with 5
replications, 4 plants per replication.
The progress of symptoms in experiments 1 and 2 were stem with light brown
discoloration around the inoculation point that extended progressively
along the stem, interveinal chlorosis or loss of turgence of unifoliate
leaves, and interveinal chlorosis of trifoliate leaves followed by plant
wilting and death. 21 days after inoculation, average percentages of dead
plants were 42 and 21 per cent for stem and seed isolates, respectively.
For experiments 3 and 4, percentage of dead plants was 56, 45 days after
emergence. These plants had roots with light brown, necrotic areas. Control
plants remained healthy. The pathogen was reisolated from the stem (100 per
cent) and root (57 per cent) tissues of symptomatic plants but not from
similar tissues of control plants.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a pathogenic relationship
between _F. graminearum_ and soybean.

[Infection of wheat and barley by _Fusarium graminearum_ (Fg) is epidemic
in USA and is increasingly becoming a threat to the world's food supply due
to recent outbreaks in Asia, Canada, Europe, and South America. Crop
quality and yield have been adversely impacted.
A major effect of Fg infection in cereals is contamination of seeds with
trichothecene and estrogenic mycotoxins, making them unsuitable for food or
feed. In Brazil, soybean crop residues in fields under conservation tillage
have been found to be heavily infested with Fg. Although the fungus also
reportedly grows on living soybean stems and seeds, many consider the
fungus non-pathogenic to soybean.
Recent surveys of soybean seed grown in Brazil also revealed infection by
Fg. Fg strains from Brazilian soybean seed consistently caused pod rot and
root rot disease on all soybean varieties, under all conditions tested.
These same strains also caused FHB in wheat.
Farmers who use a soybean/wheat crop rotation should be aware of a
potential build-up of strains that infect both wheat and soybean, reducing
the usefulness of the rotation. Brazilian strains, which also produce a
novel mycotoxin known as 3-acetylnivalenol, have not yet been found in the
U.S. In Argentina, a range of wheat cultivars are known to be infected by Fg.
