[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 1 924 663 with 82 249 (4.3%) cases reported by China. There are now a total of 1 842 414 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 214 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 71 419 cases when compared with the data on 12 Apr 2020, with the USA accounting for 26 508 (37.1%), the UK 4342 (6.1%), France 4188 (5.9%), Turkey 4093 (5.7%), Spain 3268 (4.6%), Italy 3153 (4.4%), Germany 2218 (3.1%), Russia 2558 (3.6%), Peru 2265 (3.2%), and Iran 1617 (2.3%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 95.7% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 30.5% of the global cases of COVID-19. A global total of 119 654 deaths have been reported, 116 313 (97.2%) outside mainland China.

The USA is now number one outside China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19, Spain is number 2, and Italy is number 3. While the number of daily new cases in Iran has slowed down, Turkey has shown a rapid increase in the number of cases with 4093 cases reported in the last 24 hours. The case numbers in the UK have also been accelerating, reporting 4342 cases in the past 24 hours. - Mod.MPP]

ref: Cheng MP, Papenburg J, Desjardins M, et al. Diagnostic testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2: a narrative review. Ann Intern Med. 2020; http://www.annals.org. doi: 10.7326/M20-1301
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Diagnostic testing to identify persons infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is central to control the global pandemic of COVID-19 that began in late 2019. In a few countries, the use of diagnostic testing on a massive scale has been a cornerstone of successful containment strategies. In contrast, the United States, hampered by limited testing capacity, has prioritized testing for specific groups of persons. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-based assays performed in a laboratory on respiratory specimens are the reference standard for COVID-19 diagnostics. However, point-of-care technologies and serologic immunoassays are rapidly emerging. Although excellent tools exist for the diagnosis of symptomatic patients in well-equipped laboratories, important gaps remain in screening asymptomatic persons in the incubation phase, as well as in the accurate determination of live viral shedding during convalescence to inform decisions to end isolation. Many affluent countries have encountered challenges in test delivery and specimen collection that have inhibited rapid increases in testing capacity. These challenges may be even greater in low-resource settings. Urgent clinical and public health needs currently drive an unprecedented global effort to increase testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, the authors review the current array of tests for SARS-CoV-2, highlight gaps in current diagnostic capacity, and propose potential solutions.

Key summary points
------------------
- The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the essential role of diagnostics in the control of communicable diseases.
- Laboratory-based molecular assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens are the current reference standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, but point-of-care technologies and serologic immunoassays are rapidly emerging.
- Early, massive deployment of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics for case finding helped curb the epidemic in several countries.
- Urgent clinical and public health needs now drive an unprecedented global effort to increase testing capacity.

Reasons for the rapid spread include high transmissibility of the virus (4, 5), especially among asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic carriers (6, 7); the apparent absence of any cross-protective immunity from related viral infections; and delayed public health response measures (8-10).

Age and the presence of comorbid illnesses increase the risk for death among persons with COVID-19 (11, 12). Current case-fatality rate estimates range from 0.6% to 7.2% by region and seem to be substantially higher than the 0.1% mortality rate of seasonal influenza (12, 14, 15). However, current estimates of COVID-19 case-fatality rates are probably inflated because of preferential testing in many countries of persons with severe manifestations, who are at risk for death (12, 16). In Germany and South Korea, the case-fatality rates are less than 0.5%, probably because extensive testing revealed a large denominator of mild illness (17).

Conclusion
----------
The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically highlighted the essential role of diagnostics in the control of communicable diseases. Intensive diagnostics deployment probably contributed to the success of a few countries in controlling transmission. Urgent clinical and public health needs now drive an unprecedented global effort to increase SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity. Finally, the blinding speed with which COVID-19 has spread illustrates the need for preparedness and long-term investments in diagnostic testing.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET, 13 Apr 2020

Highlights
----------
- No new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- There is no evidence that the Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine (BCG) protects people against infection with COVID-19 virus. 2 clinical trials addressing this question are underway, and WHO will evaluate the evidence when it is available. In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19. For more details, please see https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/bacille-calmette-gu%C3%A9rin-(bcg)-vaccination-and-covid-19.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China now totals 211. This includes 18 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 36 804 new cases (in the past 24 hours) of which 85.9% were reported by the USA, followed by Canada (3.1%) and Brazil (3.0%). Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Canada reported 22.4% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Brazil at 21.1%, Peru at 18.4%, Mexico at 7.3%, and the Dominican Republic at 6.7%.

The European region was slower, possibly related to the Easter weekend, having confirmed 33 243 (43.5% of the global newly reported cases) new cases and 3183 (55.8%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update. The UK reported 15.9% of newly confirmed cases, Turkey 14.4%, Spain 12.5%, Italy 12.3%, Germany 7.6%, and France 4.8%. Russia accounted for 7.7% of the newly confirmed cases, more than France and Germany. Those 6 countries (UK, Spain, Turkey, Italy, Germany, and France, representing 10% of the European countries) account for 67.6% of newly confirmed cases in Europe.

In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 1657 new cases representing 44.0%% of the regional newly reported cases. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Pakistan, and Qatar represent 11.4%, 10.3%, 8.9%, and 6.7% respectively. Removing Iran from the denominator, Saudi Arabia represents 20.3% of newly confirmed cases, followed by the UAE at 20.0%, Pakistan at 18.3%, and Qatar at 11.9%.

In the African region, Ghana reported 29.8% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by South Africa at 27.3%, Algeria at 16.8%, and Niger at 7.2%.

In the Western Pacific region, Japan reported 42.4% of the newly reported cases (outside of China), Singapore 19.5%, the Philippines 18.4%, and Malaysia 12.8%.

In South East Asia, 4 of the 10 countries reported no new cases in the previous 24 hours (including Bangladesh and Indonesia, countries that have been reporting daily increases). Of the remaining countries, India reported 94.5% of newly reported cases.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [13 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve dropped over the weekend, although the America's region did not appear to drop. Consistent with prior weekend reporting drops.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4).

For the past 3 weeks, I have had help compiling all of the data presented in the tables and preparing spreadsheets, and want to publicly thank Coleman Schaefer for his amazing assistance -- a formidable task to say the least. - Mod.MPP]
