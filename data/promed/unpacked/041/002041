The Austria Ministry of Health reported on its 2nd imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), according to a news release http://www.bmgf.gv.at/home/Gesundheit/Krankheiten/MERS_CoV_Middle_East_Respiratory_Syndrome_Coronavirus_#. The previous imported case was reported in 2014.

According to local media reports http://www.kleinezeitung.at/oesterreich/5082938/Salzburg_Arabischer-Tourist-an-MERSCoronavirus-erkrankt, the patient is a 67 year old tourist from Saudi Arabia. He was diagnosed in Salzburg province and is currently hospitalized, according to the Salzburg government http://www.bmgf.gv.at/home/Gesundheit/Krankheiten/MERS_CoV_Middle_East_Respiratory_Syndrome_Coronavirus_#.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), since September 2012, they have been notified of 1800 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 640 deaths. The viral infection has been reported from 27 countries to date.

The clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection ranges from no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death. There are reports of human-to-human and non-human to human transmission of MERS-CoV. The virus does not appear to pass easily from person to person unless there is close contact, such as providing unprotected care to an infected patient.

The route of transmission from animals to humans is not fully understood, but camels are likely to be a major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and an animal source of infection in humans.

[According to the official report from the Salzburg Ministry of Health (machine translated), the case was confirmed on 8 Sep 2016 and reported to the Federal Ministry of Health. The machine translations of the reports seem to suggest that this individual was symptomatic at his arrival in Salzburg.

More information on the epidemiologic investigations would be greatly appreciated including possible location of transmission within Saudi Arabia and history of possible high risk exposures in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. Also if the individual was symptomatic during the airline flight from Saudi Arabia or if he traveled elsewhere en route to Salzburg.

The 13 Aug 2016 ECDC Communicable Disease Threats Report stated that as of 11 Aug 2016 there have been 1815 cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 698 deaths, reported worldwide. http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/publications/communicable-disease-threats-report-13-aug-2016.pdf. Since 11 Aug 2016 there have been 6 cases including 2 deaths reported from Saudi Arabia, 1 case reported by Thailand in a Kuwaiti national and now 1 case reported by Austria in a Saudi national, bringing the global tally to 1823 cases including 2 deaths.

The HealthMap/ProMED map of Austria is available at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4482647,109 and that of Saudi Arabia at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4482647,131. - Mod.MPP]
