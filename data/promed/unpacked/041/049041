It seems that Jamshedpur city is in the grip of an unidentified virus,
as it has sent scores of people to hospitals with high fever in the
past 3 weeks. According to sources, about 30 000 people have been
diagnosed with this fever and the number is increasing every day. All
hospitals and nursing homes have been inundated with patients, while
doctors have been working overtime to bring the situation under
control.

District health officials have been running from one hospital to
another, overseeing diagnostic arrangements and advising authorities
about ways and means to increase accommodation. "The beds are full. In
some hospitals there's no space in the corridors also," said a
district health official. On an average, 500 patients are visiting the
OPD [out patient department] daily. "We have been advising patients to
take rest at home. Only those patients who need urgent attention are
being admitted," said S S Prasad, superintendent, MGM hospital.

[There is very little information available in this report, other than
a very substantial number of febrile cases. A large number of
etiological agents could be responsible, but without additional
information about symptoms in addition to laboratory and other
diagnostic findings, it is not possible to hazard a guess as to what
pathogen might be involved. ProMED would appreciate receiving
additional information as it becomes available.
