A 39-year-old construction assistant from Cravinhos in the interior
of Sao Paulo [state], died on 26 Apr [2008], in Ribeirao Preto, of
suspected yellow fever, after being admitted [to hospital] a day
earlier, the Secretaries of Health of 2 cities announced today [4 Jun
2008]. He showed several symptoms of the disease and the case
initially was diagnosed as a suspected death from hantavirus
[infection] (with infectious signs including pneumonia and internal
bleeding caused by virus).

The construction assistant worked in Ribeirao Preto, but had gone to
a wedding in Luis Antonio (Sao Paulo), near a forest. Furthermore, he
had done some work in forests in the city. The prefectures of
Ribeirao Black, Cravinhos, and Luis Antonio are intensifying the
vaccination against the disease and will blockade the areas of risk.

Ribeirao Preto has stocked 32 000 doses of the vaccine and Cravinhos
will receive 6000 doses. The tests that will confirm or not the death
by yellow fever [virus] are being done by the Institute Adolfo Lutz,
in the Sao Paulo capital.

[The region not far from the border with Minas Gerais, along the Rio
Grande, where cases of yellow fever in human and wild monkeys have
already occurred this season. This case serves as a warning that
yellow fever, like the plague of Camus, does not disappear, it hides
for a long time to reappear when least expected. The region already
has routine vaccination, now strengthening the coverage is needed. -

This is another report of sylvan yellow fever (YF) that 2 months ago
caused the deaths of 2 monkeys in the region of San Jose do Rio Preto
in the state of Sao Paulo (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20080406.1268).
This is indeed a reminder that sylvan yellow fever virus lurks in the
tropical forests of South America, and it is important that the people
residing in these forested areas get vaccinated. Maintaining good
coverage is a significant challenge, since many people live in remote
areas that are difficult to reach.
