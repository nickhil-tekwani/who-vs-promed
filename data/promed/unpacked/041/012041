Triatomid bugs infected with Trypanosoma cruzi in Catamarca, Argentina
-----------------------------------
A university professor and researcher at the CONICET [National Council of Scientific and Technical Research] issued an alert about the presence of vinchucas [_triatoma infestans_, also known as "kissing bugs" - Mod.MPP] contaminated with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes the disease know as Chagas in different parts of the Central Valley of Catamarca and the provincial capital.

The architect Marta Vigo said, "Chagas disease has been well controlled, but there is a resurgence because people have let down their guard."

"The 'kissing bug' as a vector, has its habitat throughout the Northwest [of Argentina], so it is not difficult to find in homes and buildings, but they are [routinely] killed without sending them for analysis, which should be done" she said, having spent 40 years researching the problem of housing conditions in the province.

Marta Vigo said that of 17 'kissing bugs' found on a farm in San Antonio, in the department of Fray Mamerto Esquiu, located 10 kilometers from the capital, more than half were contaminated [with _Trypanosoma cruzi_], according to the report sent to the National Chagas Institute.

Infected 'kissing bugs' were also detected in Villa Parque Chacabuco, a residential area located east of the capital and in Santa Rosa, in the department of Valle Viejo.

Vigo said there must be "a return of preventive work consisting of informing the public to recognize the variety of insect that is the vector for the disease." The expert added that "we must increase the budget for preventive brigades [teams] since [the budgets] have been insufficient.".

"We must carry out a task similar to that used to prevent dengue fever, which, up to now, has been successful," said the researcher.

[Human infection with Trypanosoma cruzi is well known in Argentina. A new study used molecular epidemiology to describe the distribution of different genotypes in 239 patients (Cura CI et al. Trypanosoma cruzi Discrete Typing Units in Chagas disease patients from endemic and non-endemic regions of Argentina. Parasitology. 2012 Feb 6:1-6. [Epub ahead of print].

A study of Chagas disease in pregnant women of South American origin living in Spain found that 5.3 percent of women emigrating from Argentina to Spain had specific-atibodies against T. cruzi, emphasizing that the infection is widespread in Argentina.
