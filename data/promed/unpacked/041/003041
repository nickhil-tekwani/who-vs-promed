Sudan: 10 cases of "Ebola-like" virus infection confirmed
---------------------------------------------------------
At least 10 cases of an Ebola-like virus infection have been reported in
southern Sudan, where 4 people have died from the infection, the World
Health Organization (WHO) said on Fri 21 May 2004.
The WHO office for southern Sudan said health authorities in Yambio county
in Western Equatoria province reported a total of 15 patients suffering
symptoms similar to Ebola [virus infection], which can kill up to 90 per
cent of its victims.
Laboratory tests conducted in Kenya and at the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention "have confirmed an Ebola-like infection in 10 of the
15 cases," WHO said. "They both agreed that the virus involved is within
the family of Ebola [the famly _Filoviridae_], but they still need to carry
out some genetic sequencing to [identify the agent precisely]. We hope to
get final confirmation within 48 hours," Abdullahi Ahmed, head of WHO's
southern Sudan office, told Reuters.
WHO said no new cases had been reported for the last 3 days, with the most
recent case reported on 15 May 2004. 2 patients are now being cared for in
a hospital isolation ward in Yambio, while health workers are following up
102 people known to have had close contact with victims. "From the data we
have, the death rate and the way it is presenting, it seems to be mild,"
Ahmed said. "But it was only yesterday that we established our monitoring
team, and we don't know the situation in the countryside."
Ebola fever starts with a high fever and headache and can lead to massive
internal bleeding. It is passed on by infected body fluids and is known as
one of the deadliest and most feared diseases in the world. An outbreak in
Congo Republic earlier in 2004 killed more than 120 people. Authorities
there said in April that they had almost brought the disease under control.

[The family _Filoviridae_ comprises 2 distinct virus genera: _Ebola virus_
and _Marburgvirus_. Ebola viruses have been isolated more frequently than
Marburg viruses, and the viruses classified in the genus _Ebolavirus_
exhibit greater heterogeneity. At present 4 distinct species of
Ebolaviruses are recognised: _Cote d'Ivoire Ebola virus_, _Reston Ebola
virus_, _Sudan Ebola virus_, and _Zaire Ebola virus_. The failure to
provide a precise diagnosis in the outbreak in southern Sudan may indicate
that a novel and perhaps less lethal strain/species of Ebola virus is
present. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
