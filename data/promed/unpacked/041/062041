Four new cases of legionnaires' disease have been reported since an outbreak of the severe form of pneumonia that sickened 16 people in the Moncton [New Brunswick] area was declared over.

Dr Yves Leger, regional medical officer of health, said in an email that the cases are unrelated to the recent outbreak, which was declared over on [10 Sep 2019].

"Legionnaires' is a underdiagnosed disease and as I previously stated, we were expecting to find cases after the outbreak was declared over given the heightened awareness in the medical community," Leger said.

Leger said the strains in the 4 newer cases do not match the outbreak strain, and are unrelated to each other. "These 4 cases are what we call sporadic, that is, they are not related to each other, and don't have a common source such as a cooling tower."

The province has continued to keep the locations of sites tested for _Legionella_ bacteria this summer [2019] a secret. A letter from Health Minister Ted Flemming cites financial impact as the reason the information was withheld from the public.

Leger previously told reporters that cooling towers in western Moncton were tested and confirmed to be the source of the outbreak, but refused to disclose the location. He said it could cause people to avoid the area, even though the issue has been fixed.

Several of the people who became ill during the outbreak have spoken publicly to say they're upset the province has kept the source secret.

[Moncton, with a population of 71 889 residents (2016), is the largest city in the Canadian province of New Brunswick and the inland center of the Maritime Provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island); Greater Moncton, encompassing Moncton, and the towns of Riverview and Dieppe, has a population of 144 810 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moncton). A map showing the location of Moncton can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Moncton,+NB,+Canada.

The previous ProMED-mail post on this legionnaires' disease outbreak in Moncton area, New Brunswick, Canada in August 2019 reported 7 cases (Legionellosis - Canada: (NB) 20190803.6603480); the news report above now says there were a total of 16 cases caused by the "outbreak strain", likely based on having matching genotypes and the confirmed source for this outbreak is said to be cooling towers in western Moncton, also likely based on matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_. This outbreak was declared over on 10 Sep 2019.

Since that time, 4 new cases of legionnaires' disease have been reported that are said to be unrelated to each other or the previous outbreak in the Moncton area, also likely on the basis of genotyping the clinical isolates. However, neither the location for these new cases within the region, nor the possible sources for these additional cases are stated in the news report above. - Mod.ML
