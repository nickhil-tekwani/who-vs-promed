In November 2006, public health officials at CDC and state health
departments detected a substantial increase in the reported incidence
of isolates of _Salmonella [enterica_] serotype Tennessee. In a
multistate case-control study conducted during 5-13 Feb 2007, illness
was strongly associated with consumption of either of 2 brands (Peter
Pan or Great Value) of peanut butter produced at the same plant.
Based on these findings, the plant ceased production and recalled
both products on 14 Feb 2007.
The outbreak strain of _S._ Tennessee subsequently was isolated from
several opened and unopened jars of Peter Pan and Great Value peanut
butter and from 2 environmental samples obtained from the plant. New
case reports decreased substantially after the product recall (Figure
1 [for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]). As of 22 May 2007, a
total of 628 persons infected with an outbreak strain of _S._
Tennessee had been reported from 47 states since 1 Aug 2006 (Figure 2
[for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]). Local and state public
health officials in multiple states, with assistance from CDC and the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are continuing to investigate
this outbreak caused by peanut butter, a new food source for
salmonellosis in the USA. All remaining jars of Peter Pan or Great
Value peanut butter with a product code beginning with 2111 should be
discarded.
Public health officials in PulseNet (the molecular subtyping network
for foodborne disease surveillance) and OutbreakNet (the network of
public health epidemiologists who investigate foodborne illnesses
nationwide) have been investigating this outbreak and attempting to
identify the mechanism of initial contamination. The investigation
began in November 2006, when public health officials in PulseNet
noted a substantial increase in the number of isolates of the
outbreak strain of serotype Tennessee; throughout 2005 and most of
2006, these isolates were reported to PulseNet at a rate of one to 5
per month, whereas in October 2006, 30 isolates were reported.
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of _S._ Tennessee
strains isolated from patients were uploaded from state health
department databases to CDC databases. Two closely related patterns
were determined to be associated with this outbreak.
A case was defined as infection with _S._ Tennessee with a PFGE
pattern matching one of the 3 outbreak patterns in a person residing
in the USA with symptom onset on or after 1 Aug 2006 (or, if onset
date unknown, _S._ Tennessee isolated on or after 1 Aug 2006). The
median age of patients was 52 years (range: 2 months-95 years); 73
percent were female. Symptoms of infection included diarrhea (72
percent), abdominal cramps (65 percent), fever (43 percent), and
dysuria (45 percent). Symptom onset dates were known for 481 of 628
patients and ranged from 1 Aug 2006 to 23 Apr 2007. 20 percent of
patients were hospitalized; no deaths were attributed to the
infection. 61 percent of isolates were from stool specimens, 35
percent from urine specimens, and 4 percent from other specimens.
The initial investigation indicated that cases were not clustered
geographically, and patient interviews conducted during
November-December 2006 by state and local officials from OutbreakNet
did not reveal a common food exposure. Officials in multiple states
then interviewed 26 patients in January 2007 using a standard
food-consumption survey instrument of approximately 200 items.
Interviews indicated that 48 percent of the patients had eaten turkey
(excluding delicatessen-sliced turkey) and 85 percent had eaten
peanut butter during the week before illness onset, higher
proportions than would be expected from food-consumption surveys of
the USA population (1).
In February 2007, a case-control study with 65 patients and 124
controls was conducted to identify the food item associated with
illness; the majority of interviews were completed by state and local
health departments and were coordinated by CDC. For the study, a case
was defined as infection with the outbreak strain of _S._ Tennessee
in a person aged at least 18 years with a history of diarrhea.
Controls were well adults from the patient's community who were
matched by geographic location. Controls were identified using a
reverse online telephone directory that when given an address
provided telephone numbers for residences in the same extended
neighborhood as the patients. The median ages for the patients and
controls were 53 and 58 years, respectively. Patients were more
likely than controls to have eaten peanut butter (81 percent versus
65 percent, matched odds ratio [mOR]) = 1.9, 95 percent confidence
interval [CI] = 0.8-5.2), to have eaten peanut butter more than once
a week (66 percent versus 40 percent, mOR = 3.5, CI = 1.4-9.9), and
to have eaten either Peter Pan or Great Value peanut butter (67
percent versus 13 percent, mOR = 10.9, CI = 3.8-43.0). Neither the
consumption of other peanut butter brands nor consumption of turkey
products was associated with illness.
Epidemiologic data suggesting Peter Pan brands of peanut butter as
the possible source of the outbreak were provided to FDA officials on
13 Feb 2007. The following day, FDA issued a health alert to
consumers indicating that they should not eat Peter Pan or Great
Value peanut butter with a product code beginning with 2111, both of
which were manufactured in a single facility in Georgia operated by
ConAgra Foods. ConAgra Foods voluntarily recalled the products,
destroyed existing products in their possession, and temporarily
halted production pending further investigation.
New case reports decreased substantially after the 14 Feb 2007
recall. Investigation of the cases is ongoing to determine whether
persons are still eating peanut butter from contaminated lots.
Subsequent laboratory testing of leftover peanut butter from patients
was performed at state public health laboratories and CDC. _S._
Tennessee with a PFGE pattern matching one of the outbreak strains
was isolated from 21 opened and unopened peanut butter jars with
production dates ranging from July 2006 to December 2006. These jars
were collected from patients in 13 states (Arkansas, Florida,
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, New York,
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Tennessee); 2 of the PFGE
strains were isolated from these peanut butter samples. FDA isolated
_Salmonella_ Tennessee from 13 unopened jars of Peter Pan and Great
Value peanut butter with production dates ranging from August 2006 to
January 2007 and from 2 plant environmental samples. Peanut butter
from the Georgia plant was exported to 70 countries. No confirmed
cases linked to this outbreak have been reported from other
countries, although several possibly related cases have been investigated.
The source of the peanut butter contamination is unknown. FDA is
investigating the plant operations, including heating temperatures,
to determine the mechanism.
Editorial Note:
Approximately 2500 Salmonella serotypes can cause salmonellosis, an
illness characterized by diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps,
typically 12-72 hours after infection (2). _S._ Tennessee infections
are rare, and the source of most of these infections is unknown. An
average of 52 _S._ Tennessee cases were reported to the National
Salmonella Surveillance System each year during 1995-2004,
representing 0.1 percent of all reported Salmonella strains (3). Only
one other outbreak of serotype Tennessee infection with an identified
food source, contaminated powdered milk, has been reported to CDC
(4). In addition to causing gastrointestinal symptoms, certain
serotypes, including _S._ Tennessee, are more likely than other
serotypes to infect the urinary tract. The percentage of patient _S._
Tennessee isolates from urine specimens increased from 15 percent
during 1995-2004 to 27 percent during 2005-2006. Because urinary
tract infections are more common among females, the high proportion
of isolates from urine in this outbreak might explain the high
percentage of identified cases among females (3,5).
This is the 1st reported outbreak of a foodborne illness caused by
peanut butter consumption in the USA. Outside the USA, one outbreak
implicating peanut butter, caused by _S._ Mbandaka, was reported from
Australia in 1996 (6). In addition, an outbreak of _S._ Agona
infection in 4 countries was associated with consumption of a
peanut-butter-coated snack produced in Israel (7,8).
Peanuts can become contaminated with salmonellae during growth,
harvest, or storage, and the organisms are able to survive high
temperatures in a high-fat, low-water-activity environment (9).
Peanut butter provides such an environment, and although it typically
undergoes heat treatment to temperatures greater than 158 F (70 deg
C), such heating might not always eliminate salmonellae (10). In
addition, after heat treatment, peanut butter that is being processed
might be contaminated by salmonellae that are introduced into the
production environment on raw peanuts or another source (e.g.,
animals in the production plant, salmonellae brought into the plant
on containers or humans from the outside environment, or other
ingredients used to make peanut butter).
This outbreak demonstrates the potential for widespread illness from
a broadly distributed contaminated product, one that has not been
previously implicated in a foodborne illness outbreak in the USA. In
addition, the outbreak demonstrates that processed food can become
contaminated even when the production process includes a
heat-treatment step, underscoring the need for effective preventive
controls in food-processing plants to prevent contamination.
Certain consumers might still be eating peanut butter from
contaminated lots. All remaining jars of Peter Pan and Great Value
peanut butter with a product code beginning with 2111 should be discarded.
