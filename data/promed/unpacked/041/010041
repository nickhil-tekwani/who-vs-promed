The 17th Regional Health of Paraná, headquartered in Londrina [Paraná state], reported this Wednesday [29 Sep 2021] that a case of West Nile fever had been recorded in a mule in the city of Porecatu. The technical note corfirming the presence of the disease was issued by Adapar (Agricultural Defense Agency of Paraná). The State Health Secretariat (Sesa) reported that it has been investigating suspected cases in humans and other possible cases of infection in animals in the municipalities of Lupionópolis and Florestópolis, also in the north of the state.

West Nile fever is a viral infection caused by an arbovirus (which is hosted by a mosquito); arboviruses also cause dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. Transmission is through the bite of infected mosquitoes, mainly of the genus _Culex_. The natural hosts are wild birds, which act as virus amplifiers and sources of infection for mosquitoes. Humans, horses, and other primates can be infected.

According to Sesa, in humans, 80% of those infected have no symptoms. Among the symptomatic, West Nile virus (WNV) usually causes fever, headache, tiredness, and body, eye, and headaches. In severe cases, the central nervous system may be involved. According to Sesa, in humans, suspicious cases are those of people with "unspecific acute febrile illness, accompanied by neurological manifestations compatible with meningitis, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis, of unknown etiology". In less than 1% of human cases of infection, there is encephalitis or meningitis, with neck stiffness, mental confusion, or epileptic seizures.

Sesa is guiding all Health Regional Offices for suspicion, notification, and collection of tests. Cases considered suspicious should be reported to the Regional Health Offices, which should increase monitoring of wild horses and birds. In animals, the signs are encephalitis, ataxia (a disorder characterized by lack of coordination of voluntary muscle movements and balance), anorexia, muscle fasciculation (involuntary muscle contraction), and lack of coordination.

["West Nile virus (WNV )is maintained in nature in a mosquito-bird-mosquito transmission cycle. Mosquitoes of the genus _Culex_ are generally considered the principal vectors of WNV, in particular _Cx. pipiens_. WNV is maintained in mosquito populations through vertical transmission (adults to eggs).

"Birds are the reservoir hosts of WNV. In Europe, Africa, Middle East, and Asia, mortality in birds associated with WNV infection is rare. In striking contrast, the virus is highly pathogenic for birds in the Americas. Members of the crow family (Corvidae) are particularly susceptible, but virus has been detected in dead and dying birds of more than 250 species. Birds can be infected by a variety of routes other than mosquito bites, and different species may have different potential for maintaining the transmission cycle.

"Horses, just like humans, are "dead-end" hosts, meaning that while they become infected, they do not spread the infection. Symptomatic infections in horses are also rare and generally mild but can cause neurologic disease, including fatal encephalomyelitis.

"Preventing transmission in horses
---------------------------------
Since WNV outbreaks in animals precede human cases, the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system to detect new cases in birds and horses is essential in providing early warning for veterinary and human public health authorities. In the Americas, it is important to help the community by reporting dead birds to local authorities.

"Vaccines have been developed for horses. Treatment is supportive and consistent with standard veterinary practices for animals infected with a viral agent."

Remember to empty any standing water from old tires, potted plants, catch basins, or other locations that can hold even a small amount of water. These are perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes. - Mod.TG
