NusaBali reports that supplies of anti-rabies vaccine for human victims of dog bites are out of stock in the Badung regency of South Bali.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The anti-rabies vaccine (VAR) stock in Badung regency at government hospitals and community health centers has been at zero since late April 2015, despite government assurances that VAR would be available to the public without charge. Patients are being referred to the Sanglah General Hospital in Denpasar that still has a limited supply of VAR.

Doctors unable to provide their patients with the potentially life-saving VAR, claim to have no information regarding the failure of the Badung Health Office to provide a steady supply. The head of the Badung Health Agency (Diskes-Badung), Dr I Gede Putra Suteja insists that money for VAR is available and the lack of stock is due to a supply chain problem.

While the bureaucracy sorts itself out, health officials are urging those in need of VAR go directly to the Sanglah General Hospital for treatment.

Post-bite rabies shots out of stock in Bali -- situation urgent
---------------------------------------------------------------
The rabies PEP [post-exposure prophylaxis] situation in Bali is currently dire. Canine anti-rabies vaccination teams have just now reported that 3 people in east Bali, who were bitten by a dog last week [week of 4 May 2015] that tested positive for rabies, managed to get their 1st post-bite shots 5 days ago when bitten, but now all hospitals and government health departments are out of stock. NGOs are currently contacting private clinics in a desperate bid to find vaccines for the individuals who were bitten. The news report below (from yesterday [10 May 2015]) is only reporting that the Badung regency in south Bali, which includes the main tourist region of the island, is out of stock, but the shortage appears to be island-wide. No vaccines in a rabies epidemic is a recipe for certain tragedy.

As of the moment, this situation is baffling me.

NusaBali, the periodical that initially reported the alleged PEP shortage, is a pro-government newspaper with very close connections to the Made Pastika regime. Pastika, a retired police official, has headed the government in Bali since April 2008; the rabies crisis has evolved entirely on his watch.

Bali Discovery, the periodical that translated the NusaBali report into English, is a mostly pro-government newspaper with close connections to the powers-that-be in the expatriate tourism community.

Given the NusaBali and Bali Discovery positions, I think their report has to be taken seriously. At the same time, as best I can determine, so far none of the Bali animal welfare organizations and none of the opposition media have picked up on it at all.

The animal welfare organizations may perhaps have elected Lisa Warden to be their mouthpiece, to avoid trouble with the political establishment. But in the past, any hint of a new rabies panic has produced bursts of postings and e-mails from pro-dog individuals and organizations. So far this time, nothing seems out of the ordinary.

I will keep you posted about further developments, as they come to my attention.

[This Bali report came to us from Lisa Warden, a respected director of DOGSTOP, a charity concerned with canine rabies.

There is an urgent shortage of post-exposure rabies vaccine in Bali, and that is a matter of concern for us all. Note the number of rabies postings for Bali, see below, that we in ProMED have issued over the past 7 years.

With thanks to Lisa and Merritt for this information. - Mod.MHJ
