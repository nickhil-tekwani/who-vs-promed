--------------------------------------------
According to the most current weekly update of table 11 (animal
disease situation per country and per disease; distributed 1 Dec
2006), the total number of confirmed bluetongue outbreaks, reported
by European Union member states during the period 1 Jan 2006 to 1 Dec
2006, was 2130 (73 added during the week of 24 Nov to 1 Dec 2006,
compared to 178 added during the week of 17 to 24 Nov 2006, 197 added
during the week of 10-17 Nov and 207 during the week of 3-10 Nov
2006).
The following summarised confirmed 2006 outbreaks are retrieved from
the last (1 Dec 2006) and the 4 previous weekly ADNS reports:
Country/ 1 Dec / 24 Nov /17 Nov / 10 Nov/ 3 Nov / last confirmation date
1. Belgium / 687 /670 /626 / 590 / 490 / 29 Nov 2006

[The following data are related to the evolution of the BTV-8
epizootic in northwest Europe during the last 6 weeks.
Country: new outbreaks in week ending 20.10/27.10/3.11/10.11/17.11/24.11/1.12
Belgium: 106 / 57 / 30 / 100 / 36 / 44 / 17
Netherlands: 57 / 54 / 42 / 50 / 28 / 8 / 2
Germany: 157 / 107 / 120 / 38 / 114 / 68 / 17
France: 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 1 / 0 / 0
An updated map, showing the BTV-8 outbreaks in the above countries
from 17 Aug to 29 Nov 2006, is available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/pdf/bt-europemap.pdf>.
For further details and maps on the evolvement of the BTV-8 epizootic
see the 29 Nov 2006 update of "Bluetongue Serotype 8 Epidemic
Bulletin" by EFSA Epidemiology Working Group at

[It seems that, at last, following extended fluctuations, the decline
in BTV-8 incidence in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands has become
significant, reflecting the decreased temperatures and subsequent
decreased activity of the vector. See also "Bluetongue Serotype 8
Epidemic Bulletin by EFSA Epidemiology Working Group", updated 29 Nov
2006, at
<http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/in_focus/bluetongue/outbreak_overview.html>.
It remains to see if the disease disappears during the coming winter
months or rather resurfaces next year. As reported previously (see
Rudy Meiswinkel et al's observations in 20061024.3042), a suspected
main vector in the current BTV-8 epizootic is _Culicoides dewulfi_, a
monophyletic cattle-dung breeder known to be native to Northern
Europe. Previously all bluetongue outbreaks in Europe were linked to
the African vector (_C. imicola_). As _C. dewulfi_ is a European
species, there is a fear that bluetongue could become endemic in this
region with the risk of more cases occurring next year during the
vector activity's post-winter months.
The only efficient way to protect susceptible European sheep breeds
against this devastating disease is by vaccination. One wonders if
preventive vaccination is being considered and -- in case affirmative
-- which steps for the manufacturing of safe and efficient,
monovalent, live-attenuated or inactivated BTV-8 vaccines are being
undertaken. - Mod.AS]
