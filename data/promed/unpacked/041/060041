MERS-CoV enigma deepens as reported cases surge
-----------------------------------------------
Researchers are struggling to explain a rapid rise in reported infections with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). As of 16 May 2014, the number of laboratory confirmed cases globally had climbed to 614, with 181 deaths. 418 of those cases have been reported in the past 2 months, mostly in Saudi Arabia.

After it was 1st identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, MERS infections have been reported throughout the Arabian peninsula and exported to at least 10 other countries. Most confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection have developed severe acute respiratory illness, but the virus also often causes kidney and other organ failure. The mortality rate is around 30 per cent, and there is currently no vaccine or specific treatment available. While stopping short of proclaiming the outbreak an international public health emergency, the WHO Emergency Committee on MERS-CoV announced on 14 May 2014 that its concern over the situation had "significantly increased", with particular worries over recent evidence that the infection is spreading in hospitals, and apparent "gaps in critical information".

One of the most crucial gaps is our lack of understanding of where the virus comes from, says Marion Koopmans, of the Netherlands National Institute of Public Health. So far, studies have more or less ruled out sheep, cattle, goats, and poultry as a source, but dromedary camels throughout the Arabian peninsula and in parts of North and East Africa have been shown to carry the virus. However, it is still too early to say definitively that they are the main source of primary infections in humans, says Koopmans. "I am convinced that people and dromedary camels share the same viruses, but how exactly this happens we do not know", she explains. "Camels shed virus from their nose, and sometimes in stool, which is dropped and may cause environmental contamination. Younger animals seem to be virus-positive more often than adult animals, so combined, the best bet would be to look for exposures (direct or indirect) to young camels as the highest risk factor." As young camels lose their maternal immunity they become more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, and the fact that the latest surge in cases corresponds with similar smaller spikes throughout April and May in 2012 and 2013 in Jordan and Saudi Arabia also suggests that the breeding season could be a factor.

However, a seasonal increase in exposure to young camels alone doesn't seem a sufficient explanation, according to Ziad Memish, Saudia Arabia's deputy minister for public health and professor in the College of Medicine at Alfaisal University in the capital Riyadh. "More than 2/3rds of the primary human cases have no links to camels", he notes. One possibility is that another species is acting as an intermediary. Bats have been touted as a possible source after a bat of the _Taphozous_ genus was found [in an abandoned house in a date palm orchard in Bisha, a small Saudi Arabian city; see 20130822.1895035] to harbour a fragment of the MERS sequence, but contacts between bats and people are so rare that it "would seem an unlikely explanation", says Koopmans.

Another zoonotic infection, Nipah virus, has been shown to stem from the consumption of date palm sap contaminated by infected fruit bats, but Christian Dorsten, a virologist at the University of Bonn, Germany, who is working with local researchers in Saudi Arabia, says talk of a similar link between bats and MERS is farfetched. "There are several aspects in recent hypotheses around MERS and bats that make no biological sense at all. For example, it is not true that taphozous feeds on dates from which the virus could be acquired. Taphozous is insectivorous", he says [see comment].

Another possible explanation for the recent surge in cases is that the virus has acquired mutations enabling it to be transmitted more easily between people, but again, Dorsten notes, the facts tell a different story. Many of the recent cases occurred in the port city of Jeddah [Saudi Arabia], and sequences taken of the Jeddah viruses show no hints of any relevant genetic changes, says Dorsten.

The Jeddah viruses do, however, seem to be a different strain from those causing infections elsewhere in the country, and are probably linked to a hospital-associated outbreak, according to Dorsten. "Without having seen epidemiological data, I predict that most cases detected in Jeddah will be linked quite directly to the outbreak in King Fahd Hospital from where it spread to other hospitals", he says.

The prevention of future outbreaks will hinge on countering the "surprising lack of information about how this virus is transmitted from animals to humans", says Maria Van Kerkhove, liaison between WHO and the UK MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling, Imperial College London. "Basic epidemiologic studies have still not been done to evaluate risk factors for infection", she says. "We know that infection control and prevention works to stop human-to-human transmission, but without stopping transmission from camels, we will continue to see more cases in the Middle East, some of whom will travel outside of the region".

[With regard to bats, the following (edited) comment has been received from ProMED-mail subscriber Merritt Clifton:

"For what it's worth, I continue to suspect that the real culprit behind MERS-CoV will turn out to be neither a camel nor a fruit bat, but rather an insectivorous bat -- probably a very tiny insectivorous bat whose diet includes both fruit flies from dates and some of the very small flies who nest in camels' dense hair.

"Camels, because of their size and the density of their hair, which is mostly short but thick enough to protect them against blowing sand, host far more insects than most other animals -- most of them relatively harmless mites, small flies, etc. If you brush a camel's coat, you'll be astonished at the size and diversity of the insect zoo that collects among the loose fur: crawling, flying, larvae, eggs, et al."

Clifton's speculation on the possible involvement of arthropods in MERS-CoV epidemiology is in need of information on the infection dynamics in camels; do they undergo a viraemic phase? If yes, what is its duration and virus load? These, and other aspects of possible animal roles in the disease transmission, could become available if experimental infection trials are realised. The need for such trials, raised in the past, has been pointed at recently in OIE's updated MERS-CoV Q&A page of 12 May 2014 (see commentaries in 20140517.2478989 and 20140523.2493556). - Mod.AS]

[2] Antibodies in camels, Kenya, 1992-2013

re: Corman VM, Jores J, Meyer B, Younan M, Liljander A, Said MY, et al. Antibodies against MERS coronavirus in dromedary camels, Kenya, 1992-2013.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Dromedary camels are a putative source for human infections with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We showed that camels sampled in different regions in Kenya during 1992-2013 have antibodies against this virus. High densities of camel populations correlated with increased seropositivity and might be a factor in predicting long-term virus maintenance.

The Study [excerpt]
-------------------
Samples were obtained from 774 dromedary camels in 3 regions in Kenya (Northeastern, Eastern, and Rift Valley [former administrative provinces]) and 7 counties (Mandera, Wajir, Isiolo, Marsabit, Laikipia, Turkana, and Baringo) during 1992-2013 [map at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/8/14-0596-f1.htm]. Blood samples were obtained from farmed or nomadic camels by jugular vein puncture. Serum samples originated from the archives of the International Livestock and Research Institute (ILRI) (Nairobi, Kenya).

Conclusions
-----------
The present study showed that dromedary camels from Kenya have antibodies against MERS-CoV, which complements the current finding that MERS-CoV is a common pathogen in dromedary camel populations. Our finding of MERS-CoV antibodies in dromedary camels as early as 1992 is consistent with findings of a recent report from Saudi Arabia, which suggested that MERS-CoV has been circulating in dromedary camels for at least 20 years.

To project and potentially control virus spread, the public health community must understand factors determining virus maintenance. Our group and others have demonstrated that young dromedary camels have lower seroprevalences and are more likely to carry infectious virus. Similar observations have been made for coronaviruses in their original chiropteran [bats] hosts wherein strong virus amplification occurred soon after the time of parturition [Ref 1]. Young, immunologically naive animals may thus facilitate virus amplification in dromedary camel populations.

We also demonstrated that dromedary camel population density shows a positive correlation with MERS-CoV seropositivity, which suggests efficient MERS-CoV maintenance or spread if herd density is high. Different types of animal husbandry in the Northeastern and Eastern regions of Kenya might be better predictors of virus transmission among camels. Dromedary camels in this area are often nomadic following rainfall patterns, and are taken across borders into neighboring countries, such as Ethiopia, for trade purposes. The observed increase in seropositivity from the Western region to the Northeastern and Eastern regions could be attributed to increased animal-to-animal contact in cross-border dromedary camel metapopulations.

Conversely, dromedary camels that originated in the Northeastern region but had been held in isolation since 1998 were negative for MERS-CoV antibodies, which is consistent with absence of antibodies in dromedary camels bred in isolation in Dubai. The combination of nomadic husbandry for a large population and presence of young virus-susceptible animals might facilitate virus maintenance. However, our retrospective study with archived samples could not assess hypotheses for each of the individual variables to determine their relative and absolute degrees of influence on virus circulation.

Because exportation of dromedary camels is largely unidirectional from eastern Africa into the Arabian Peninsula, our findings might facilitate the search for more ancestral MERS-CoV variants to clarify the natural history of acquisition of MERS-CoV by dromedary camels and its putative transmission to humans. Our recent finding of a MERS-CoV ancestor in bats from South Africa highlights the need for wider investigations of viral reservoirs. The fact that no human MERS cases have been observed in eastern Africa could indicate less transmissibility of viruses in regional lineages or lack of detection and reporting of cases. Serosurveys of persons handling dromedary camels in this region could help to determine whether silent or unrecognized infections are being maintained in humans.

[Kenya maintains one of the world's largest dromedary camel populations, namely about 3 million (OIE's 2012 data) out of the world's estimated total of 25 million.

The call for serosurveys of persons handling dromedary camels, expressed by the authors, deserves to be heard and responded to in wider geographic realms where dromedary camels are present in considerable numbers, including Africa and the Middle East. - Mod.AS]

The Department of Agricultural Affairs in the Eastern Province [of Saudi Arabia] [map at http://tinyurl.com/oo32au5] has confirmed that there are no cases of MERS infection in the camels in the province but has detected the presence of virus-carrying antibodies [? - clarification requested] in the animals.

Salahudeen Al-Dosari, deputy director general of agricultural affairs, said that field teams have been formed to collect samples from several locations in the province starting from Hafar Al-Batin. Random samples have been collected and they are now awaiting results.

Al-Dosari said: "There is joint coordination between the Ministries of Agriculture and Health regarding the common diseases between humans and animals. A working team has been formed to receive reports and prepare daily logs on the latest developments." He said that the team will diagnose and take samples from the animals to conduct the necessary laboratory tests in the event of a patient contracting the virus by being in direct contact with them. "The Ministry of Agriculture is in constant communication with the World Organization for Animal Health [OIE] to take urgent action in the event of the appearance of any injuries or diseases in animals in general," he added.

[4] Oman, regional FAO-organised consultation meeting
Date: Wed 21 May 2014

http://main.omanobserver.om/?p=82887


The 2-day Regional Technical Consultation Meeting on MERS-CoV and Animals that brought 50 of the region's and the worlds experts to work together, share information and expertise and decide on the best way forward in battling this deadly virus, which records show has already infected over 600 people and caused 188 deaths, concluded here yesterday [20 May 2014]. In order to halt its spread, delegates called for a united stand and positive commitment to eliminate MERS-CoV.

Yesterday's sessions reviewed the current situation of MERS-CoV in Yemen, Qatar, Jordan and a case study from Bahrain. There were also a number of presentations and discussions, as well as outlined conclusions and recommendations. The final session saw local, regional and FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations) give their deliberations. This meeting was organised by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in cooperation with FAO. The Observer spoke to participants including Dr Juan Lubroth, chief veterinary officer, FAO, and Ernie Colaizzi, laboratory director of Research Associates Laboratory (RAL) about the meeting and MERS-CoV. Dr Lubroth noted: "This is the 1st regional conference that we've had on this subject and we're very grateful for the Sultanate of Oman for hosting it.

"The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have been very transparent with their findings of MERS in the animal population. And I think it's been admirable, in the way the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have handled it." He explained, "MERS is caused by coronavirus, but there are many different types of coronaviruses, that we know of, some causing mild disease in children and some causing severe disease ­- like the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that started in China and spread to Singapore and Canada, killing 800 people before it was stopped."

Commenting on a study conducted on camels in the region and in Spain, he said, "It is interesting because the Canary Islands are off the coast of Africa ­- it's a province that belongs to the Iberian peninsula ­- and it was a closed population, meaning that 18 years ago camels were brought in for tourism, but they stopped bringing in animals 18 years ago. So it was a closed population, no new introduction, yet 15 per cent of them were positive, so we suspect it is an old infection of camels ­- not a disease ­- because we do not see laudable clinical signs in camels." Regarding where the disease emanates from, he pointed out, "We have to keep an open mind, we should look at other animals ­- we know that many different types of coronavirus are in different animals ­- are camels the source or are they also innocent bystanders? We do not know."

In his comments Colaizzi, noted the need is to identify the source and type, saying, "Camels have been testing positive for 2 of them, but what percentage do test positive? We don't know." So do we exclude camels from your society? No, they are too economically important. What about camel meat consumption? Will people get MERS by eating camel meat and drinking camel's milk? That's kind of been the thought, but none of that's been proven. So, the race is on to try and find out what is really going on with this organism in both man and camels and any other sources that there may be. Is the virus coming from bats to camels? Is it from insects to camels? Or is just camels to camels?

"There are so many unanswered questions that it's a race for time. We don't want this to blow up into a pandemic and with Ramadhan coming up (with people going on Umrah and later on Haj) do we now have millions of people catch MERS and spread it out? There are 9 countries that have had MERS outbreaks. We're not sure how they got infected; we're sure some health workers contracted the disease from infected people in hospitals. It does look like it's spreading real quickly from person to person at this point in time. But again, the knowledge is so minimal; what we say now may turn out to be nothing and this is the end of it, or it may turn out into something that quickly explodes, a pandemic."

[Though the information on the possible role of camels in MERS-CoV maintenance and transmission has increased significantly since the fall of 2013, many questions remain to be clarified. Diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection in camels has, so far, been reported to the OIE (as an emergency/zoonotic disease) from 2 countries: Qatar and Oman. Similar reports are anticipated from other affected countries, particularly Saudi Arabia.

Serological investigations are suggestive of the long-standing circulation of MERS-CoV (or its close relatives?) in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tunisia, Kenya and probably Egypt. Similar situation may prevail in other parts of Africa (and elsewhere). To evaluate the significance of these findings and draw conclusions, serosurveys in persons handling dromedary camels in these countries are in urgent need.

The approaching mass gatherings of pilgrims in Saudi Arabia will require decisions which, besides the need of being scientifically sound, may be influenced by political, economical and other considerations. For one: should contact between the pilgrims and local camels be controlled/limited? One wonders if the epidemiological information, accumulated so far, allows professionals to provide sound, unequivocal advice to politicians at this stage. - Mod.AS]
