CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- State epidemiologist Gayle Miller was cited as saying
that an _E. coli_ outbreak in western Wyoming that sickened at least 50
people was likely caused by a contaminated town water supply. The bacteria
that sickened people in the town of Alpine, home to 470 people, probably
came from cattle, elk or deer waste that found its way into the town's
spring-fed water system.
It is only the second outbreak in the nation that has been linked to
municipal water.
A 1990 outbreak in rural Missouri killed four people and hospitalized 32
others; 21 people were confirmed to have been infected in that outbreak.
Health officials said the strain responsible for the Wyoming outbreak,
which arose in late June, can lead to kidney failure, anemia, clotting
problems and in some cases, coma and death.
