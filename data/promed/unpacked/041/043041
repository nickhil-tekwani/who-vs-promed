Another Sindh ibex has died in the Khirthar National Park following
the recent wave of a viral disease in some of the herds, bringing the
death toll of ibexes to 48. Experts have termed it as a disaster that
has gripped the protected park for the 1st time in its history.

The officials of the Sindh Wildlife Department have taken the samples
from the dead animals with the help of veterinary experts of the
Sindh Agricultural University Tandojam and sent them to the
University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore so that the
actual reason of the deaths could be ascertained.

The Sindh Wildlife Department has declared an acute emergency in the
park and strictly prohibited the entry of domestic livestock in its
premises so that the disease could be curtailed from spreading
further. The affected herds of Sindh ibexes have also been isolated
from the rest of the ibex population. The department has also started
treating the affected ibexes by mixing medicine in the water at the
drinking points in the park.

The wildlife department also plans to establish isolated cells and
enclosures so that the affected animals could be kept for treatment.
A team of experts comprising officials and experts of the Sindh
Wildlife Department and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Pakistan and
eco-journalists visited the park on Thursday [15 Oct 2009], led by
famous wildlife expert and national program manager as well as chief
technical advisor of the Pakistan Wetlands Program, Richard Garstang.

The team visited the Gau Mar peak of the Khirthar range and found
several ibexes, and it appeared that it would be impossible for the
wildlife department to catch any animal for treatment in case of an
infectious disease.

The team later found a dead ibex lying between the bushes just beside
the Janako area where the wildlife department has artificially
established a small water pond for the animals. "Game watchers have
[reported] that this ibex was blind and was roaming in the area for
the last several days, and whenever any ibex becomes blind, its death
becomes imminent," said Sindh Wildlife Department Provincial
Conservator Hussain Bux Bhaagat. Garstang said there are
possibilities that the animals became blind after being affected by
the viral disease. "But the death of a single animal does not prove
this theory, and the actual reason could only be determined after the
laboratory results," he said.

Garstang said the Sindh Wildlife Department was running out of
resources and if needed, experts in Dubai could be contacted for
technical help. "It's a viral disease. ... It could have spread in
the park after some affected livestock from Sindh or Balochistan
entered the park. The situation became serious because ibexes could
not be caught and immediately treated like in the case of sheep,"
said Garstand. "If this happened in an advanced country, special
arrangements such as helicopters could have been used, but there are
no such facilities here," he said. The disease has spread in the
herds living on the Bhamb and Lahoot peaks of the Khirthar range, and
wildlife officials are afraid that it could spread to other herds on
other peaks.

The official record reveals that the Khirthar National Park is spread
over an area of 1193 squire miles. For such a huge park, the
department does not have sufficient funds. Though there are several
game watchers working in the park, the department cannot afford to
provide them special vehicles or equipment.

The Sindh ibexes live in segregated herds on different peaks of the
Khirthar range, and therefore whenever there is an outbreak of a
disease, the wildlife staff is unable to keep proper vigil on the
animals. Australian experts conducted a survey in the year 2000 and
found that the total population of ibexes was 13 000 in the park.
"Now the ibex population has risen to about 16 000 to 17 000," said Bhaagat.

[The above article includes only one clinical sign, namely
"blindness", besides the described mortality of 48 ibexes. It is not
clear why a "viral disease" is mentioned as suspected. Without
further details, various infectious as well as non-infectious
etiological factors could be involved.

Among the OIE-listed diseases which may fatally affect caprines, the
following are known to be present in Pakistan, according to the
country's 2008 annual report to the OIE: Bluetongue, Contagious cap.
pleuropneumonia, FMD, PPR, Rabies and Goat pox. Of those, PPR is a
plausible cause of infection and mortality in the ibex (which is a
caprine). However, PPR does not cause blindness. The cause of the
described cases should not be restricted to OIE-listed diseases.
Clinical signs (including duration of the disease), pathological
changes, and age distribution among the affected animals are among
the data required, as well as -- above all -- the results of a
laboratory investigation.
