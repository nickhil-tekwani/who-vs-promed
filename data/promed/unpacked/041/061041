Xinhua news agency reported today, 5 Mar 2007, that experts in Yunnan
Province have linked a bacterium with the massive food poisoning at a
wedding banquet. No deaths have been reported.
The 371 villagers in Linxiang District of Lincang City in the province [of
Yunnan] soon fell ill after a banquet on Thu 1 Mar 2007, with symptoms of
vomiting and diarrhea. Some of the banquet dishes were contaminated with
_Staphylococcus aureus_, a bacterium that may produce an enterotoxin, which
will lead to acute gastroenteritis, said Zheng Wenkang, director with the
Yunnan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. "A duck dish
was contaminated by the bacteria due to unqualified storage, cooking
process, and transport," Zheng told Xinhua.
The 371 patients were guests and family members of a villager who was
hosting the banquet at home to celebrate his daughter's marriage. As of
today, 5 Mar 2007, 11 victims are still in hospital for further
examination, but their symptoms aren't as severe, according to Yang
Guangxiong, governor of Linxiang District.

[Staphylococcal food poisoning is now implicated in this outbreak although
the illness generally abates within 24 hours. The following is extracted
from the USA Food and Drug Administration's Bad Bug Book regarding
staphylococcal food poisoning, a disease with an incubation period of 4-8
hours, that generally causes an illness with vomiting and little fever (see
<http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap3.html>):
"In the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper interviews
with the victims, and the gathering and analyzing of epidemiological data,
are essential. Incriminated foods should be collected and examined for
staphylococci. The presence of relatively large numbers of enterotoxigenic
staphylococci is good circumstantial evidence that the food contains toxin.
The most conclusive test is the linking of an illness with a specific food,
or, in cases where multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in
the food sample(s).
"In cases where the food may have been treated to kill the staphylococci,
as in pasteurization or heating, direct microscopic observation of the food
may be an aid in the diagnosis. A number of serological methods for
determining the enterotoxigenicity of _S. aureus_ isolated from foods, as
well as methods for the separation and detection of toxins in foods, have
been developed, and used successfully, to aid in the diagnosis of the
illness. Phage typing may also be useful when viable staphylococci can be
isolated from the incriminated food, from victims, and from suspected
carriers, such as food handlers.
"A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce
symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when
_S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.
"Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning
include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as
egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as
cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich
fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable
handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated
temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal
food poisoning."
