The Ministry of Health has declared a yellow fever (YF) outbreak today (Thu 29 Nov [2018]) in Sakure, Nzara County, Gbudue state (formerly Western Equatoria state).

The declaration was preceded by a briefing meeting with His Excellency Salva Kiir Mayardit, the president of South Sudan, to gain a high-level political support, commitment, and advocate for improved access to the affected area.

Addressing a press conference in Juba, Hon. Ms Awut Deng Acuil, the acting minister of health, urged the general public to be vaccinated against yellow fever to protect themselves from the risk of yellow fever virus.

The suspected case was 1st reported on [Fri 23 Nov 2018], after the State Ministry of Health (SMoH) received a report of a suspected case of Ebola at the point of entry (PoE) in Sakure, a border town between the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan.

Following the reported suspect case, the Ministry of Health, with support from WHO and partners, deployed a rapid response team (RRT) composed of the SMoH director-general, a medical officer, laboratory staff, a nurse, WHO, and other partners from Yambio Ebola Taskforce, for in-depth investigations as well as sample collection.

The preliminary GeneXpert testing at the National Public Health Laboratory was negative for Ebola Zaire. In the same way, follow-up Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing in the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) Entebbe was negative for all Ebola species, Marburg, Rift Valley fever, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, and Sosuga viruses. Further testing of the sample at UVRI using Taqman array card platform and YF-specific PCR assay confirmed that the sample was PCR-positive for yellow fever virus.

The confirmation of the case automatically triggers the activation of the YF incident management system (IMS) with an incident manager designated to coordinate response to this event, including risk communication, surveillance, and disease control to prevent further spread of the disease, said the undersecretary, Ministry of Health, Dr Makur Matur Koriom.

To enhance outbreak response efforts, the Ministry of Health will also send the national rapid response team to conduct follow-up epidemiological, entomological, and laboratory investigations.

Addressing the same press conference, the acting WHO country representative in South Sudan, Mr Evans Liyosi, commended the Ministry of Health for declaring the outbreak, as the announcement enables the public to take prevention measures, helps health partners take the necessary steps to contain the outbreak, and unlocks the required resources for fighting the epidemic.

Yellow fever is a viral disease that is transmitted by mosquitoes belonging to the _Aedes_ species. Yellow fever can lead to serious illness and even death. Yellow fever vaccine is the best protection against yellow fever disease, which can be fatal.

"Thanks to the financial contributions from the European Union Humanitarian Aid (ECHO) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department for International Development (DFID) allowed WHO to deploy experts and provide technical and logistical support," said Mr Liyosi.

The press conference was attended by the media, high-level government officials, and the National Ebola Task Force, among others.

[It is not clear if the yellow fever virus infection was acquired in South Sudan or in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). There is no indication if the DRC health authorities have been alerted, given that the case comes from Sakure, a border town between the 2 countries. A swift response to this single case is important to determine the risk of ongoing transmission. Although urging the public to become vaccinated is important, it is unlikely to elicit the same response that an organized vaccination campaign would. Within the past 4 months, there were reports of fake YF vaccination certificates being sold in South Sudan. If true, that practice must be stopped. One hopes that the current case is a single one, perhaps due to spillover from a sylvan (forest) or rural transitional maintenance transmission cycle of the virus and not human-to-mosquito-to-human urban transmission. - Mod.TY
