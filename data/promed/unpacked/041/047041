Anthrax spores were found on the police officer and 2 lab technicians
investigating the case of anthrax at NBC, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said
Sunday. The mayor said they were being treated with antibiotics and were
expected to be fine. He emphasized that exposure to the spores does not
necessarily mean they have the anthrax infection. "When they were tested,
minuscule spores were found," Giuliani said at a news conference.
He said the police officer who retrieved the envelope was found to have
anthrax in his nose, as did one lab technician investigating the case.
Another lab technician was found to have a spore on her face, Giuliani said.
"They are being treated," he said. "This does not mean they have anthrax."
The mayor also said the Police Department has received more than 100 calls
from people concerned about exposure, and that hospital emergency rooms have
also experienced numerous inquiries. But he stressed: "None of them have
proven to be anything else but negative."

New anthrax exposures in New York
---------------------------------
A police officer and 2 laboratory technicians who handled a letter sent to
NBC News that contained anthrax were exposed to anthrax spores, New York
Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Sunday. The 3 people were shown a letter addressed
to anchor Tom Brokaw while searching for the source of the spores that gave
an NBC News employee the cutaneous (skin) form of the disease. The letter,
postmarked 18 Sep 2001, from Trenton, New Jersey, later tested positive for
anthrax.
A few spores of the potentially fatal bacteria were found in the police
officer's nose, Giuliani said. One of the lab technicians had one spore in
her nose; the second lab technician had several spores on her face. All
3 are being treated with ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic.
The presence of the spores does not mean the people will get the disease,
said Dr. Steve Ostroff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"As long as you give these individuals antibodies [sic, I think he meant
'antibiotics', - MHJ to keep them from getting the disease, there is
essentially zero likelihood that they will develop disease," he said.

[It is hard to discern whether all 3 persons were together at NBC involved
in picking up the contaminated letter or whether the policeman had
delivered it to the laboratory where the 2 technicians would have then been
exposed. Either way, along with the minor exposures at Palm Beach it points
out how these spores can fly if only in small numbers -- there is a
suggestion that [the Florida patient who died was myopic and had got very
close to the spores that infected him. - Mod.MHJ
