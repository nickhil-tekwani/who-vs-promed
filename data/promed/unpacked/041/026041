Ended: 22 Apr 2021
Reported: 28 Apr 2021

New outbreaks:
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (2)
Outbreak location 1: Communes of Prot-Bouet, Bingerville, Anyama, Songon, Youpougon, Abatta and Ndotre, Abidjan
Started: 15 Dec 2020
Ended: 15 Mar 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Rabbits / 2029 / 1636 / 1636 / 0 / 393 / 0
Affected population: The population belonged to semi-extensive farms.

Outbreak location 2: Commune of Adzope, Adzope, La me, Lagunes
Started: 22 Feb 2021
Ended: 22 Apr 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Rabbits / 76 / 76 / 76 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: The affected population belonged to semi-extensive farms

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc), introduction of new live animals

Epidemiological comments: The epizootic affects domestic rabbits of all ages. The causal agent that has been identified and is currently circulating is RHVD-2 since December 2020. The disease is currently localized in the south of the country, mainly among small-scale breeders, where biosafety standards are not satisfactory. Surveillance is both active and passive, with the involvement of breeders' groups and associations.

Control measures applied, domestic: official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste, quarantine, disinfestation, slaughter

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type: Laboratoire national d'Appui au Developpement AgriCole (LANADA) (National Laboratory)
Species / Test / Outbreaks / Test date / Result
Rabbits / real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) / 2 / from 19 Jan to 25 Apr 2021 / positive

["Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious and acute fatal hepatitis of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_), caused by a calicivirus (genus _Lagovirus_). Up to 2010, all RHD viruses (RHDV) isolated belonged to one of the 6 identified genotypes (GI-GVI), among which the GVI is an antigenic subtype (RHDVa). In 2010, an additional RHDV was identified, phylogenetically and antigenically distinct from RHDV and provisionally called RHDV2 or RHDVb. A similar disease, termed European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), has been described in the hare (_Lepus europaeus_).

"RHD is characterized by high morbidity and a mortality of 70-90 [per cent] for RHDV/RHDVa and 5-70 [per cent] for RHDV2. Infection mainly occurs by the oral route. In wild rabbits in particular, insects are considered an important route of infection or transmission and are often the source of long-distance spread. The incubation period of RHD varies from 1-3 days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever. The main clinical manifestations of the acute infection are nervous and respiratory signs, apathy and anorexia. In rabbits younger than 4-6 weeks, the RHDV/RHDVa infection course is subclinical, but when the causative agent is RHDV2, clinical signs and mortality are observed even in young animals from 15 to 20 days of age onwards." Source: OIE Terrestrial Manual 2018 - Rabbit hemorrhagic disease, Chapter 3.6.2 https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.06.02_RHD.pdf.

"As of 2020, RHDV2 has become established in wild lagomorphs in a number of European countries, Australia and parts of Africa. In some locations, RHDV2 has largely replaced classical RHDV or RHDVa. Outbreaks have also been reported in New Zealand and some countries in the Middle East, Asia, and North America, but whether the virus will persist in some of these locations is not yet certain. In North America, this virus was found in both domestic and feral rabbits. There is no indication that any lagoviruses infect humans." Source: Spickler, Anna Rovid. 2020. Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease.
