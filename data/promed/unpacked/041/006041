Experts at the inaugural session of the 2-day "Date Conference" were
unanimous that poor management, inadequate infrastructure, and lack
of standardization were the main hurdles in boosting date production
and export in the country.

Minister for Food, Agriculture and Livestock (MINFAL), Nazar Muhammad
Gondal, described agriculture as the backbone of the country's
economy, adding that government was focusing on this sector for its
sustainable development. He appealed to scientists to come out with
solutions to the problems and issues confronted by the farmers in
date cultivation, adding that they can help the country become food
secure in this era of food scarcity.

Commissioner (Minor Crops), Dr Muhammad Aslam Gill, in his detailed
presentation highlighted various issues and problems related to date
production and exports. He said the post-harvest losses were very
high, and that farmers lose about 50 percent of their crop during
post-harvest period. The situation is aggravated due to unwanted
rains and different kinds of diseases on the date palm trees, he
added.

[The date palm (_Phoenix dactylifera_) is a vital staple food for the
inhabitants of desert and arid lands. It originates in northern
Africa and southwest Asia where it is a traditional crop, but today
it is cultivated in most hot, dry regions throughout the world. Trees
start producing after 4-5 years, reach full production after 10-12
years, and can live for more than 100 years. A large number of fungi
and a number of other pathogens, as well as several diseases of
unknown etiology have been reported for this crop. It is likely that
the trees in Pakistan are affected by some of these diseases and that
disease management and prevention of pathogen spread is hampered by
the general problems of date cultivation described above.
