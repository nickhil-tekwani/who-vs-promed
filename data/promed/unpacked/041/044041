"FMD is regarded to be endemic in China. According to the People's Republic of China page on the WRLFMD [World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease] website, last updated in 2015, the following serotypes have been recorded there throughout the years:
FMDV-O: 1958, 1986, 1999-2001, 2003, 2005, 2010-2014
FMDV-A: 1951, 1958, 1960, 1962, 1964, 2009-2010, 2013-2014
FMDV-C: 0000
FMDV-Asia 1: 1958, 2005-2009
FMDV-SAT 1: 0000
FMDV-SAT 2: 0000
FMDV-SAT 3: 0000

China's annual reports to the OIE since 2010 mention 2 circulating serotypes: O and A. According to the 2013 genotyping results, as presented in the WRLFMD website, the FMDV-A strain circulating in China is a topotype ASIA, lineage Sea-97 strain; for details, see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2013/WRLMEG-2013-00009%20A%20PR%20China%202013.pdf." - Mod.CRD]
