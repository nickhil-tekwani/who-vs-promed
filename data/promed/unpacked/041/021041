13 cases of acute Chagas disease were registered in a district of
Belem, Para state. Suspicion is that contamination occurred from food.

The Para state health secretary confirmed on Monday [9 Nov 2009] an
outbreak of Chagas disease. In 2 weeks, there have been 13 cases in a
neighborhood in Belem. According to the state government, there were
no deaths.

The secretary also said that the transmission occurred with the
ingestion of contaminated food, including acai. The department said it
was investigating the cases.

[The oral mode of transmission of Chagas disease is being increasingly
recognized in the region. It is associated with the contamination of
fresh food or beverages with intestinal contents of triatomid bugs
infected from wildlife reservoirs. The insects are accidentally
ground up with the acai berries when preparing the drink.

More information and photographs of the vector are available at
<http://www.uta.edu/chagas/html/biolTinf.html> and from the CDC at
