Hantavirus [infection] has claimed the life of a teenager in northwestern New Mexico.

The state Department of Health said [Fri 6 Aug 2019] the death of a 15-year-old McKinley County boy is the 3rd case of hantavirus in New Mexico this year [2019] and the 2nd death [see archive 20190626.6539746].

Hantavirus is a deadly disease transmitted by infected rodents through urine, droppings, or saliva. People can contract the disease when they breathe in the virus that is suspended in the air.

Health Secretary Kathy Kunkel says people need to avoid contact with mice and other rodents and be careful when cleaning up and avoid disturbing rodent droppings and nests, particularly in closed spaces such as sheds.

The department says the deer mouse [_Peromyscus maniculatus_] is the main source for the hantavirus strain most commonly found in New Mexico.

[The hantavirus involved in the case above doubtless is Sin Nombre virus. Sin Nombre hantavirus is endemic in New Mexico, and a few cases have occurred there annually in recent years, except for last year (2018). Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine, and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the Sin Nombre virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg. - Mod.TY
