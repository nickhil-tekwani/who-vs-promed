Dozens of cows die due to snoring disease
-----------------------------------------------
Dozens of cows have died in 2 districts of Kupang regency, East Nusa
Tenggara [Nusa Tenggara Timor], after suffering from nasal
schistosomiasis, or snoring disease, an official said. [East Nusa
Tenggara is in the southeastern part of the Indonesian archipelago,
south of Sulawesi; see map at
<http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Indonesia_provinces_english.png>].

At least 32 cows in the districts of Amabi Oefeto Timur and Semau had
died as of Wed [2 Nov 2006], and hundreds of others are seriously
ill, Amabi Oefeto Timor district head Yohannes Tende said.

He urged the government to take emergency action to prevent the
disease from spreading to nearby areas.

"Local people were stunned to find that their cows died within hours
of showing signs of the disease," Tende said.

He explained that an animal health team from the Kupang Agriculture
Office had been deployed to treat the cattle.

"The infected cows have been isolated to enable the animal health
team to treat them," he added.

[Nasal schistosomiasis is a chronic disease of cattle, horses, and
occasionally buffalo prevalent in the Indian subcontinent, eastern
and southeastern Asia. In severe cases, there is a copious
mucopurulent discharge, snoring, and dyspnea; milder cases frequently
are asymptomatic.

Adult flukes of the causative parasite, _Schistosoma nasale_, are
found in the blood vessels of the nasal mucosa, but the main
pathogenic effects are associated with the eggs, which cause
abscesses in the mucosa. The abscesses rupture and release eggs and
pus into the nasal cavity, which eventually leads to extensive
fibrosis. In addition, large granulomatous growths are common on the
nasal mucosa and occlude the nasal passages and cause dyspnea.

Though there is no reason to doubt the contribution of _S. nasale_ to
the sickness described in the press item, its rapid course, if
accurately reported, deserve caution in reaching a definite
diagnosis; the possible involvement of other disease agents,
including bacterial (e.g. anthrax), viral (e.g. EHD) or toxicological
ones, should be excluded.

_S. nasale_ does not infect humans. - Mod.AS]
