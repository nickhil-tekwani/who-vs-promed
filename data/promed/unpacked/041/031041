Unusually wet weather is causing scab, or _Fusarium_ head blight, to
show up in south central and eastern Nebraska wheat fields,
University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) specialists say. However, it is
too late in the growing season for wheat growers to combat the
problem, said Stephen Wegulo, UNL plant pathologist in the
university's Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources. "This is
a really serious problem that is hitting abruptly," Wegulo said. "A
lot of growers haven't experienced this and may underestimate the
problem." Scab has not been common in Nebraska in recent years due to
drier than normal conditions, Wegulo said.
The only way scab can be managed is by planting tolerant cultivars,
crop rotation out of cereal grains or grasses, fungicide seed
treatments and foliar fungicide applications, which should be timed
to prevent infection, which occurs mainly during flowering. Nebraska
wheat already has gone through the flowering stage.
Symptoms include premature bleaching of spikelets or the entire
immature head. Bleaching can start anywhere on the head and spread
until the entire head is bleached, Wegulo said. Bleached spikelets
are sterile and contain shriveled and/or discolored seed. During
humid conditions, white or pink fungal growth with orange spore
masses may be seen on the bleached spikelets. Blue-black fruiting
structures also can form, giving the head a scabbed appearance, hence
the name scab. The disease can take over an entire field in severe
cases.
"During the last few weeks, there have been reports of bleached or
white heads in south central and eastern Nebraska wheat fields,"
Wegulo said. "Surveys in Saline, Saunders, Holt and York counties
from 7-11 Jun 2007 revealed these symptoms were caused by scab, or
_Fusarium_ head blight."
The toxins
-----------
In addition to lowering yields and grain quality, the scab fungus
also can produce mycotoxins, said Michael Carlson, UNL diagnostic
toxicologist. The total crop may be lost if grain is rejected because
of the toxins produced. "Most likely, the fungus will produce
vomitoxin (deoxynivalenol) and zearalenone," Carlson said. Vomitoxin
was found during the wheat scab epidemic of 1982, and zearalenone was
found at a much lower incidence. That was the last year the scab
occurred in Nebraska.
Carlson said the presence of zearalenone would be of greater concern
than the presence of vomitoxin. Zearalenone acts like estrogen, the
female sex hormone, and can affect the reproductive cycle of breeding
females, especially pigs. Ruminant animals are not as sensitive as
non-ruminants to the effects of zearalenone.
Vomitoxin is not very toxic, Carlson said, but it can affect feeder
pig performance. "It is associated with feed refusal in pigs," he
said. "Feeder steers and heifers are not adversely affected by
vomitoxin in the diet."
"Fumonisins -- common, more toxic mycotoxins -- have not been found in
scabby wheat because the species of _Fusarium_ that causes it does not
produce them," Carlson said. "In addition, the weather conditions
favorable to wheat scab do not favor fumonisin production, and they
are usually found in corn."

Implications for corn
----------------------
Scab may be caused by several species of _Fusarium_ and is favored by
wet weather during the growing season. These fungi also cause stalk
and ear rots in corn and seedling blights in cereal grains, Wegulo
said. "It can survive in soil or corn, wheat and grass stubble. Scab
is also more severe in reduced or no-till fields, especially if wheat
follows corn," he said.
Spores of the scab fungi are carried by air currents. Most infections
occur during flowering because anthers and pollen serve as a food
source for the fungi. Infected seed can transmit the fungi to
emerging seedlings, Wegulo said. "This can cause severe seedling
blight under favorable conditions for disease development," he said.
"During warm temperatures (77-86 F / 25-30 C), blight symptoms appear
within 3 days following infections. Therefore, a crop that appeared
healthy a few days ago can suddenly show widespread symptoms."

[2] _Ascochyta_ blight, chickpea - USA (Montana)
Date: 18 Jun 2007

<http://www.montana.edu/cpa/news/nwview.php?article=4928>

_Ascochyta_ blight has been identified on chickpeas in Montana near
Bozeman, Billings and Sidney. The rapidly spreading disease is
favored by cool, wet conditions such as Montana has been
experiencing, said Mary Burrows, Montana State University Extension
plant pathologist.
Burrows said that producers with chickpeas should be prepared to
spray at least twice with fungicides during the growing season to
control the blight. Because the disease can spread very rapidly,
producers should spray a fungicide at the 1st sign of disease.
"Producers should scout early and often for symptoms of _Ascochyta_
blight," she said. Those symptoms include circular lesions with black
specks that are visible with a magnifying glass. The lesions appear
on leaves and stems, and stem girdling and breakage can also be
present.
Since fungicide-resistant _Ascochyta_ blight has been identified in
North Dakota, it is important to rotate the chemicals used to treat
the blight in Montana, Burrows said. No fungicide-resistant
_Ascochyta_ has been identified in Montana so far.
The North Dakota strain is resistant to strobilurins, and North
Dakota has recommended against using any strobilurins to control
_Ascochyta_ this year [2007]. "Once a fungus is resistant to one
strobilurin, it generally is resistant to all strobilurins, and we
could lose these as a tool to control _Ascochyta_," Burrows said. To
avoid that problem, it is important for growers near North Dakota to
use non-strobilurin fungicides this year.
Other options to control _Ascochyta_ blight are use of certified seed
and seed treatment with thiabendazole to manage seed-borne
_Ascochtya_, even if seed has tested to be disease-free.
Small kabuli and desi chickpeas are generally less susceptible to
_Ascochyta_ blight, so fewer fungicide applications may be necessary
than for large kabuli chickpeas, Burrows said. _Ascochyta_ also
attacks lentils and peas, but the species causing the blight in
chickpea is different from the ones causing blight in lentils and
peas.

[_Fusarium_ head blight (FHB; scab) is an important disease affecting
wheat and barley worldwide, with yield losses often exceeding 45
percent. It was 1st described in England and has been a problem in
the USA since the early 1900s.
FHB is caused by _F. graminearum_, but 9 phylogenetic species are
currently recognized within this species complex. These are often
limited to particular regions of the world. At least 4 of these
species contain strains capable of causing FHB on wheat. Only one
species is currently known to exist in production wheat and barley
fields in the USA.
_Fusarium_ ear rot produces a white to pink mold on corn cobs, with
infected kernels often scattered amongst healthy looking ones.
Several _Fusarium_ species may be responsible, but _F.
verticillioides_ is of primary concern in the US, since it produces
the toxin called fumonisin.
_Ascochyta_ blight of chickpea is caused by _Ascochyta rabiei_ and is
considered to be the most important disease of chickpeas worldwide.
The pathogen attacks all aerial portions of the plant and is specific
to chickpeas. It can survive in infected plant material for at least
2 years under dry conditions, but viability is lost rapidly in high
humidity. The fungus is seed borne at a rate of 50-80 percent. Seed
transmission is the primary mode of spread both locally and worldwide.
_A. lentis_ causes blight in lentils and _A. pinodes_ in peas.
Strobilurins are strongly antifungal agents produced by fungi. They
were 1st discovered in 1977 in _Strobilurus tenacellus_, a
basidiomycete growing on pine cones.
