Trichinellosis in Altai region, Russia
-----------------------------------------
Epidemiologists fear that trichinellosis is worsening in the Altai region,
the press-service of the Altai Regional Office of the Russian (Health)
Protection Agency (Rospotrebnadzor) said.
According to experts, up until today [7 Dec 2005], 46 persons have been
diagnosed with trichinellosis in the region this year. For all of 2004, the
number was 33 cases. A principal cause of disease is the use of badger,
pork or dog meat not boiled thoroughly and used in shish kebab and sausages.

[The Altai region is in the south of Western Siberia near the rivers Bii
and Katun. The region shares a border in the south and southeast with
Kazakhstan, in the southwest with the Republic of Altai, in the west and
northwest with the Kemerovo region, and in the north with the Novosibirsk
region. The population is approximately 2.5 million (2005). - ProMED-mail

[Trichinellosis is frequent in Russia, and ProMED has previously reported
outbreaks due to infected badgers, dogs and bears being used for human
consumption. Only health education can prevent infection by _Trichinella_
from wild animals. - Mod.EP]
