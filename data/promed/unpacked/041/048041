[Benchmark Reporter (http://www.benchmarkreporter.com/reemergence-of-ebola-epidemic-in-liberia-test-on-dog-carcass-tested-negative-for-now/6266/) notes that 2 new Ebola cases [in Liberia] had also been confirmed in addition to 3 of the formerly recorded ones, so a total of 5 new cases have been confirmed in the new outbreak. It is not clear whether there are a total of 4 or 5 cases since 9 May 2015, whether these last 2 cases have been confirmed as Ebola, and whether they were contact cases or independent of the index case. - Mod.LK]

Summary
-------
30 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in the week to 5 Jul 2015: 18 in Guinea, 3 in Liberia, and 9 in Sierra Leone. Although this is the highest weekly total since mid-May 2015, improvements to case investigation and contact tracing, together with enhanced incentives to encourage case reporting and compliance with quarantine measures have led to a better understanding of chains of transmission than was the case a month ago. This, in turn, has resulted in a decreasing proportion of cases arising from as-yet unknown sources of infection (5 of 30 cases in the week to 5 Jul 2015), particularly in previously problematic areas such as Boke and Forecariah in Guinea, and Kambia and Port Loko in Sierra Leone. However, significant challenges remain. A residual lack of trust in the response among some affected communities means that some cases still evade detection for too long, increasing the risk of further hidden transmission. The exportation of cases to densely populated urban areas such as Freetown and Conakry remains a risk, whilst the origin of the new cluster of cases in Liberia is not yet well understood.

In Guinea, cases were reported from the same 3 prefectures -- Boke, Conakry, and Forecariah -- that reported cases the previous week. The northern prefecture of Boke, which borders Guinea-Bissau, reported 6 cases compared with 10 the previous week. All but one of these cases was a registered contact, with a single case reported to have arisen from an as yet unknown source of infection. The single case reported from Conakry came from the Matam commune (municipal district) of the city and was a known contact of a previous case from Benty sub-prefecture in Forecariah. The remaining 11 cases were reported from the prefecture of Forecariah, 9 of which were reported from the sub-prefecture of Benty. All but 2 of the 11 cases reported from Forecariah were known contacts of a previous case or have an established epidemiological link to one.

Liberia was declared free of Ebola transmission on 9 May 2015, after reporting no new cases for 42 consecutive days. The country subsequently entered a 3 month period of heightened surveillance, during which approximately 30 blood samples and oral swabs are collected each day from potential cases and tested for EVD. On 29 Jun 2015, this routine surveillance detected a confirmed case of EVD in Margibi County, Liberia, the 1st new confirmed case reported from the country since 20 Mar 2015. The case was a 17 year old male who first became ill on 21 Jun 2015, died on 28 Jun 2015, and subsequently tested positive for EVD. Two contacts of the first-detected case have since been confirmed as EVD-positive. These additional cases are from the same small community as the first-detected case and are now being treated in an Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) in the capital, Monrovia. In addition, a probable case is in isolation at an ETC. The case has a strong epidemiological link to the 1st-detected case and is showing some symptoms of EVD, but has indeterminate test results for EVD. The origin of infection of the cluster of cases is currently under investigation. At present, these cases are considered to constitute a separate outbreak from that which was declared over on 9 May 2015.

In Sierra Leone, 9 cases were reported from the same 3 districts as the previous weeks: Kambia, Port Loko, and the district that includes the capital, Freetown. 1/3rd (3) of all cases reported from Sierra Leone arose in the densely populated Magazine Wharf area of Freetown. All 3 cases were registered contacts of a previous case. Four chiefdoms in Kambia each reported a single confirmed case of EVD, as did 2 chiefdoms in the neighbouring district of Port Loko. All but one of these cases were known contacts of a previous case or have an established epidemiological link to one.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
--------------------------------------------------
There have been a total of 27 573 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1: see source URL) up to 5 Jul 2015, with 11 246 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 18 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea, 3 in Liberia, and 9 in Sierra Leone in the week to 5 Jul 2015.

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2: see source URL). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), adults aged 15 to 44 are approximately 4 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and Liberia, and 3 times more likely to be affected in Sierra Leone.

In the week to 5 Jul 2015, one new health worker infection was reported from Kambia, Sierra Leone. A total of 875 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 509 reported deaths (table 5: see source URL).

[According to a health official in Liberia who asked for anonymity since research is ongoing, "I learned today [8 Jul 2015] the result was negative, but we have to be careful because the remains are in bad condition, and the test is designed for humans." Humans, monkeys and pigs are known to be able to carry the Ebola virus, but there has never been proof that dogs can carry it, although a 2005 study showed that dogs in areas of Gabon affected by past Ebola outbreaks had antibodies against it, suggesting they might be survivors.

According to the hospital, the Ebola virus has not yet been confirmed in the man, but all measures were taken to be safe. The RIVM [National Institute for Public Health and the Environment] was called in, and the patient was isolated immediately. The emergency room was closed down and is being cleaned by a specialized cleaning company. Patients are being redirected to the emergency room in Bergen op Zoom while the one in Roosendaal is closed.

The man was transferred to Erasmus MC in Rotterdam with special transport. He did not have contact with other patients in the waiting room of the emergency room. He did, however, have contact with 5 employees of the hospital. They are being watched for any symptoms. According to the hospital, there is no risk of infection in the hospital.

The decision on when the emergency room can open again will be made on Monday morning [6 Jul 2015] in consultation with a microbiologist.]

Non-governmental organizations
------------------------------
8 Jul 2015 World Health Organization: WHO "unprepared to deal with Ebola" - panel
http://www.3news.co.nz/world/who-unprepared-to-deal-with-ebola---panel-2015070808#ixzz3fF3IZo68
[According to a United Nation's-appointed panel's highly critical report, issued on Tuesday [7 Jun 2015], WHO "tends to adopt a reactive, rather than a proactive, approach to emergencies" and failed to act on the warnings of experienced staff on the ground. The report also found that when WHO did finally mobilize, Director-General Margaret Chan and senior staff failed to show the "independent and courageous decision-making" required to deal with governments of the affected countries. In addition, the report indicated that WHO also failed to engage with local communities early on or to communicate what could be done, for example, to reduce the infection risk from burials.

The original report, with a link to the WHO response:

[Comment on criticism of WHO's Ebola response
---------------------------------------------
Reports on the acknowledged failure of WHO's response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa are beginning to emerge. But there is as yet no acknowledgement that WHO was not set up to include epidemic rapid response teams.

Importantly, on 12 May 2015, in document A68/26, WHO wrote: "A minimum balance of USD 100 million is proposed for the contingency fund, based on the recommendations of the Review Committee on the Functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005) in relation to Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 whose implementation was urged by the Health Assembly in resolution WHA64.1 in 2011."
http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA68/A68_26-en.pdf
I have not seen any report that this recommendation was adopted, and if so, that it will be funded or suffer from the same lack of support as the H1N1 flu recommendation.

Article 2 of WHO's Constitution reads: In order to achieve its objective, the functions of the Organization shall be:
...
(d) to furnish appropriate technical assistance and, in emergencies, necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of Governments;
...
(g) to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic, endemic and other diseases...
http://www.who.int/governance/eb/who_constitution_en.pdf

WHO was never set up with staff to investigate epidemics, only to give expert advice on how to deal with them. On request from a country hit by an epidemic, WHO has always asked the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to parachute in and deal with it, which CDC has always done expeditiously. In the last 35 years, WHO working with CDC and other international partners has succeeded in eradicating smallpox worldwide, eliminating autochthonous measles from the Americas, beating polio back to only 8 countries, beating back schistosomiasis in Egypt and guineaworm to only 4 countries in Africa, and interrupting transmission of onchocerciasis (river blindness) in 10 West African countries, among other signal achievements.

In its response to the criticism, WHO says:
"WHO is already moving forward on some of the panel's recommendations including ... the contingency fund to ensure the necessary resources are available to mount an initial response."

WHO called for a USD 100 million contingency fund in the wake of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) epidemic, but member states never provided the money. I cannot find any mention of a USD 100 million epidemic contingency fund in the 16 Jan 2015 document "Implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005) Report of the Review Committee on Second Extensions for Establishing National Public Health Capacities and on IHR implementation" http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB136/B136_22Add1-en.pdf. Is WHO now expected to drop most of its other programs to deal with the present and future Ebola epidemics?

The criticism is unfair: nobody except Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Western military bioweapons defense forces and task force "Scorpio" (see ref. below) had any idea how to deal with urbanized or nosocomial Ebola, and foreign military were not politically acceptable in the beginning.

PS - Neither is there a contingency plan on how to ramp up vaccine production to deal with widespread urban epidemics of yellow fever (YF) if the virus were to be imported into vector-infested tropical states of India or China, which would make W. African Ebola look insignificant. Urban YF is easily avoidable by strict urban vector control -- which would also eliminate urban dengue in many places -- and shutting down the black market in fake YF vaccination cards.
