More than 30 farms in B.C. and Alberta remain under quarantine, as
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) continues to identify and
test livestock after bovine tuberculosis was found in a bull that
spent part of its life on a ranch in Vanderhoof.

CFIA senior veterinarian Dr. George Luterbach said Friday [26 Nov
2007] the quarantines on 8 B.C. ranches and 25 in Alberta won't be
lifted for some time yet as the CFIA conducts traces and tests on 150
"animals of interest" in B.C. and a further 800 in Alberta.

"That does not mean they're all alive at this point in time, because
they go back a number of years, but we will follow up on each and
every sale from the farm, and if they are alive and in somebody
else's herd, then we will extract them out," Luterbach said. "Many of
the culls from the infected herd would have been slaughtered and
checked out for TB as part of the normal slaughter process, so they
will not be out there in anyone else's herd at this point in time."

So far, 221 head of cattle determined to have been directly exposed
to the bull have been put down -- 66 from the Vanderhoof ranch, 5
from the other B.C. ranches and 105 from the ones in Alberta -- and
samples from them have been sent to CFIA laboratories.

If any of those steers are found to have the disease, the net could
be further widened, depending on the extent of their contact with
other cattle.

"Our policy is to eliminate all animals that have been in contact
with a known positive," said Luterbach, who was in Vanderhoof earlier
this week to give an update to area ranchers.

He said the drastic action is needed to prevent a full-blown outbreak.

The disease was found in the bull during routine testing after it
went to slaughter in August 2007.

The CFIA did not make the incident public until early November 2007
and only after the Citizen received a tip from ranchers concerned
about the time it had been taking to deal with the matter.

Luterbach stressed the incident is not a public health issue because
bovine TB is not easily contracted by humans.

"The public is protected by meat inspection and by pasteurizing milk,
so it's not a threat to the general public," he said. "The owners of
the animals, we were able to contact them directly rather than
through a public announcement."

Public health personnel work with people living on farms where bovine
TB has been detected, he added.

Questions raised during the meeting in Vanderhoof revolved around
general knowledge and clarification of the issue, said Luterbach, who
estimated 100 people attended.

"People were there to learn and to clarify, and it's put everybody
pretty much on the same page," he said.

[Although various lesions at slaughter may be highly suggestive of
tuberculosis, it can take 6 weeks or more to definitely culture the
organism. TB is a slow insidious disease, can spread before it is
realized, and the actions taken by CFIA will hopefully prevent
finding any other animals in the index herd positive. Certainly, the
Canadians are hoping that animals moving out of the herd (trace outs)
are not positive. - Mod.TG]
