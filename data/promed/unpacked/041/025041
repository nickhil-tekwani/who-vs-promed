A Macon County child is North Carolina's 1st confirmed case of La
Crosse viral encephalitis this season. State health officials say the
child contracted the illness from a mosquito bite. Symptoms of the
ailment can include fever, headache and nausea. Victims of a severe
case can experience convulsions or they may even fall into a coma.
Officials didn't identify the child who caught the virus, but say he
or she is recovering.

La Crosse encephalitis is largely found in western North Carolina,
and is the state's most common mosquito-borne disease. Last year
[2010], North Carolina recorded 21 cases. Although it's rarely fatal,
a Swain County child died from the illness in 2009.

[Normally, ProMED does not post reports from endemic areas where
cases occur commonly. The above North Carolina case occurred in one of
the focal LACV endemic area, but is a bit early. Clinical encephalitis
caused by La Crosse virus is most common in pre-school aged children.
As this report indicates, it is seldom fatal, but significant hospital
stays may occur and there may be neurological sequelae. Cases may
occur earlier in the summer season than other arthropod-borne viruses
because the virus can be transovarially transmitted by the infected
female to her eggs, so that emerging adults may already be infected
and ready to transmit the virus, without the need to take an
infectious blood meal from an infected forest mammal. The mosquito
involved mainly is day-biting _Ochlerotatus (Aedes) triseriatus_ .

LACV is a member of the California serogroup of arboviruses. A map of
the distribution of California virus serogroup neuroinvasive disease
cases (mainly LACV cases) shows 3 major focal geographic areas (1) in
the unglaciated areas of southeastern Minnesota/southwestern
Wisconsin/northwestern Illinois, (2) Ohio and (3) the central
Appalachian Mountain areas of Virginia/West Virginia and North
Carolina (see the CDC map at http://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html).
There are scattered cases in other states in the eastern USA. The CDC
has a good summary of LACV, its epidemiology, geographic distribution
and clinical characteristics (http://www.cdc.gov/LAC/index.html).
