H3 influenza virus found in British Columbia
-----------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has quarantined a turkey layer
farm in Abbotsford, British Columbia based on preliminary results from the
British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries (BCMAFF)
indicating the presence of the H3 influenza virus in the flock.
The turkey farm is near a swine farm that recently experienced an H3
influenza infection, and the virus is suspected to have originated from
swine. Transmission of this influenza strain between swine and turkeys has
been documented previously.
This low pathogenic H3 virus is a milder form of virus and has not been
known to mutate into high pathogenic avian influenza as the H7N3 strain did
last year [2004] in the Fraser Valley. This is not related to the avian
influenza outbreak in 2004, and all testing by BCMAAF to date is negative
for the H5 or H7 strains of the virus.
While the CFIA and BCMAAF investigated the situation, with the cooperation
of the producer, every biosecurity measure was implemented. The CFIA is
sending samples to the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases in
Winnipeg for further testing.
