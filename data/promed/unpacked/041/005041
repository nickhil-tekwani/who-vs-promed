Washington DC
--------------------
Anthrax found at CIA
Walter Reed mailroom also has anthrax
---------------------------------------
Traces of anthrax have been found in a building at the Central
Intelligence Agency in Langley, Virginia, where incoming mail is
sorted, U.S. officials tell CNN. Meanwhile, a mailroom at the Walter
Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Maryland, has tested
positive for anthrax, a military spokesman told CNN Friday.
The amount of anthrax detected at the CIA was "medically
insignificant" an official said, but the building has been closed until
further testing and cleaning can be done. [Some experts say there is no
such thing as a "medically insignificant" amount -- there may, in fact,
be no lower threshold number of spores for anthrax to infect. But so
far it seems as though very few people may have actually received an
infectious dose. - Mod.JW
Officials say 31 different sites in the mail receiving building and the
CIA's main mailroom have been checked since 23 Oct 2001. Only one
site tested positive for anthrax. No CIA personnel have tested positive
for anthrax exposure, however antibiotics have been offered to all staff
handling mail in bulk and to any other interested employees of the
agency.
Like many other U.S. agencies, the CIA receives its mail via the
Brentwood post office facility in Washington, where 2 postal workers
have died from inhalation anthrax and a number of others are being
treated in hospitals.
A spokesman for the U.S. Army Medical Research and Material
Command said a mailroom at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research
tested positive for anthrax. The institute does not care for patients and
is 3 miles from the hospital at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.
The spokesman, Charles Dasey, said the mailroom at the facility will be
closed Friday, but the institute will be open for business and employees
will be reporting to work.
The U.S. Postal Service Thursday began trucking some mail addressed
to federal government offices in Washington to an Ohio company to be
irradiated to prevent more anthrax-laden letters from reaching
government targets.
Crews in congressional office buildings are using a special solution to
kill anthrax spores on walls, furniture and office equipment.
The State Department said Thursday the diagnosis that one of its mail
handlers has inhalation anthrax has been confirmed by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. A second mailroom employee with
"flu-like" symptoms is being tested for anthrax.

[As the authorities examine more letter sorting facilities, more spores
will be found, indicating, if nothing else, how these machines pummel
letters. - Mod.MHJ

New York City
-------------------
Anthrax at NYC Mail Distribution Center - Report
--------------------------------------------------
Traces of anthrax have been found at New York's largest mail
distribution center, the first instance of the germ warfare agent being
detected at a mail facility in the city, the New York Times reported on
Friday.
The newspaper said tests found anthrax contamination in 4 high-speed
sorting machines [at the Morgan processing and distribution facility.
According to the Times, postal authorities said the machines had been
contaminated by anthrax-laced letters that might have been sent from
Trenton, New Jersey and then delivered to television network NBC and
The New York Post tabloid newspaper, where employees have
contracted anthrax.
Postal officials closed off the part of the center where the machines are
situated, the report said.
