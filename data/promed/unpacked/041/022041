A woman in her 30s who returned to Japan from Sri Lanka after coming
down with a fever has been confirmed as having contracted a viral
fever called chikungunya, health officials announced Wednesday [24 Jan 2007].

It is the 1st time in Japan that a Japanese person has been confirmed
as having contracted the disease.

The woman, whose name has been withheld, came down with a fever in
Sri Lanka in mid-November last year [2006] and was diagnosed by local
doctors as having either chikungunya or dengue fever. When she
temporarily returned to Japan in mid-December [2006], she went for a
medical checkup, and in mid-January [2007], an antibody test
conducted at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases confirmed
that the disease was indeed chikungunya.

The woman has already recovered from the symptoms and returned to Sri
Lanka, where she lives.

Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry officials said the symptoms of
chikungunya include fever, inflammation of the joints, and rash. The
death rate from the disease is extremely low. The disease is spread
through mosquito bites and cannot be transmitted directly from person
to person.

[With the continuing chikungunya outbreak in South and Southeast
Asia, the medical community in countries in the northern hemisphere
that have mosquito vectors of this virus will have to be alert to the
potential for its introduction and transmission with the onset of
warm weather. - Mod.TY]
