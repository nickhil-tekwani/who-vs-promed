Here, we report the isolation of multidrug resistant _S._ Paratyphi A producing CTX-M-15-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) from a traveler returning from India. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _S._ Paratyphi A with CTX-M-15-type ESBL isolated from a human. Enteric fever, including typhoid fever caused by _S. enterica_ serotype Typhi (_S._ Typhi) and paratyphoid fever caused by _S. enterica_serotype Paratyphi A (_S._ Paratyphi A), is one of the most important febrile illnesses in tropical and subtropical countries, with high rates of morbidity and mortality [1]. In industrialized countries, enteric fever is a common cause of fever in returned travelers [2]. The emergence of drug-resistance in _S._ Typhi and _S._ Paratyphi A is an emerging public health problem. Owing to the recent increase of fluoroquinolone resistance, 3rd-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, have become the primary drugs for treatment of enteric fever [3].

Case report
-------------
In July 2013, a Japanese woman in her mid-20s was admitted to a hospital in Manali, India for fever over 38.5 C [101.3 F], diarrhea, and anorexia, where she was diagnosed with typhoid fever based on clinical symptoms and a non-specified rapid serological test. She had been in India for 5 weeks prior to the admission. Before her visit to India, she had been on a 7-week trip to China, Myanmar, Thailand, and Nepal. She was treated with parenteral cephalosporin for 3 days. No further details on the treatment regimen in India were available. The patient returned to Japan on day 4 of illness owing to sustained fever, diarrhea, and anorexia. During her travel from India to Japan (days 5-7), the patient took oral combined ofloxacin-cefixime. On day 7, she was admitted to our hospital with diarrhea and anorexia but without fever. On examination, deep palpation of the lower abdominal area caused mild discomfort, otherwise, physical examination was normal. She did not have any underlying illness, and was not on any regular medication. Eight months prior to the admission at the hospital in India, she had been vaccinated against _S._ Typhi (Vi polysaccharide).

Laboratory analyses
---------------------
On admission, stool and blood samples were taken for culture. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institutes [4]. The patient's stool was screened on admission for methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Gram-negative rods resistant to one or multiple agents in the extended-spectrum cephalosporin class and/or that demonstrated elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (greater than one mg/L) to imipenem and/or meropenem. Screening culture of stool was positive only for drug-sensitive _Escherichia coli_ and _Enterococcus spp_.

Results from blood cultures were positive for _S._ Paratyphi A 2 days after admission, and _S._ Paratyphi A was found to be resistant to cefotaxime (MIC = 64 mg/L) and ceftazidime (MIC greater than 16 mg/L). Addition of clavulanic acid to each cephalosporin lowered the MIC to 0.25 mg/L and 1 mg/L, respectively. This isolate was also resistant to nalidixic acid, and categorized as intermediate to ciprofloxacin (Table [For table, see original URL. - Mod.LL]). Due to the atypical susceptibility pattern and the requirement for the verification susceptibility test process, it took longer than one week for the final susceptibility result to be available.

The presence of the gene conferring the ESBL phenotype was verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described elsewhere [5]. Sequencing of the PCR products revealed that _S._ Paratyphi A was positive for blaCTX-M-15. The presence of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes including qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrS, and aac(6')-Ib was investigated using PCR described elsewhere [6-9]. However plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were not detected in this isolate.

Patient treatment and outcome
-------------------------
Upon admission, we treated the patient with ceftriaxone (2 g per day for 8 days), and the patient's symptoms resolved after 8 days of admission. After the final susceptibility results were available, the initial antibiotic treatment was changed on day 9 from ceftriaxone to azithromycin (orally, 500 mg per day), which was administered for 7 days. A stool culture obtained on admission was negative for _S._ Paratyphi A. Stool cultures repeated before changing antibiotic treatment as well as 8, 9, and 10 days after completing azithromycin treatment also remained negative for _S._ Paratyphi A. The patient was discharged 10 days after admission.

Discussion and conclusion
------------------------
Although ESBL-producing organisms are emerging among Enterobacteriaceae, ESBL-producing _S._ Typhi or _S._ Paratyphi A have been reported rarely in Nepal and the Middle East [10,11]; CTX-M-15 type ESBL-producing _S._ Typhi were previously reported in patients in Middle Eastern countries [11,12].

blaCTX-M-15 genes have been identified worldwide in Enterobacteriaceae; further, isolation of these genes from _Escherichia coli_ has been reported to be increasing [13]. The acquisition of blaCTX-M-15 as a transferable plasmid from another enteric bacterium has previously been reported in _S._ Typhi [5].

Of particular concern are reports of increasing isolation rates of _S._ Paratyphi A from India and other parts of Asia [14], which might be attributed to use of protective vaccines (Vi polysaccharide and live oral Ty21a) effective against _S._ Typhi, but not _S._ Paratyphi A [14].

The number of reports on ESBL in _S._ Typhi and _S._ Paratyphi A is still limited, and thus, extended-spectrum cephalosporins would still be a reasonable empiric treatment for a suspected case of enteric fever in the current situation. The patient improved on day 8 before antibiotics were changed. The oral treatment by a fluoroquinolone (ofloxacin) prior to the admission might have contributed to her clinical improvement. Other possible explanations include clinical recovery by natural history of _S._ Paratyphi A, or infection of 2 different antimicrobial patterns of _S._ Paratyphi A, i.e. ESBL-_S._ Paratyphi A and non-ESBL-_S._ Paratyphi A, with non-ESBL mainly contributing to clinical symptoms.

Potential increase in the plasmid-mediated spread of ESBL in _S._ Paratyphi A in the future would pose a threat to public health. Judicious use of antibiotics to avoid unnecessary selective pressure on intestinal bacterial flora, and careful microbiological analysis of patients with typhoid fever, especially those returning from the Middle East or south Asia, are approaches critical for prevention of the potential spread of multidrug resistant _S._ Paratyphi A.

[Paratyphoid fever is similar to typhoid fever, in that both are enteric fever types of disease, although the former can be, but is not necessarily, less severe. The paratyphoid salmonellas are divided into A, B, and rarely now C. _Salmonella paratyphi_, also referred to as _S. enterica_ serotype Paratyphi. Types B and C also have species, now serotypes, _schottmuelleri_ and _hirschfeldii_, respectively. Like typhoid, paratyphoid is generally considered not to be a zoonosis, with only humans as the reservoir, but the paratyphoid bacillus has been isolated from domestic animals and fish. - Mod.LL
