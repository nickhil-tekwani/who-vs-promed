An 11-year-old boy has died while 7 other children are among 20 people presently admitted at the Olenguruone sub-county hospital in Kuresoi South, Nakuru County, after consuming meat of a dead cow suspected to have been infected with East Coast fever. Locals had feasted on the carcass after a veterinary officer reportedly directed them to where the dead cow was buried.

Village elder Joshua Langat told Citizen Digital that the boy is said to have drunk soup from the meat of the carcass.

The body of the deceased has been moved to the said facility's morgue.

A nurse at the facility who requested anonymity said the other victims, including the children, are in stable condition even as more are still being rushed there.

[Nakuru county, Kenya, is in the southwest region of the county; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakuru_County.

Clearly, this cow did not die from East Coast Fever if they are getting a significant number of the locals sick with one fatality. There is a high probability that this cow died from anthrax. If the bloody soup had been boiled for 10 to 15 minutes any anthrax spores and vegetative cells present would have been killed, but if not quite a number could still be alive and virulent.

If it is possible, the village needs to be revisited and bloody soil samples collected from where the animal was butchered. If the skull is still there, sample the nasal turbinate bones, as if it was anthrax they will be rife with anthrax spores. In our experience, turbinate bones have live spores for years after the animal has died, even when left in the sun on the ground or on a fence post.

We are seeing a number of veterinary officers giving faulty advice concerning dead cows. One may hope that the government arranges for a refresher course for their Veterinary Officers on cattle diseases, and certainly the recognition of possible anthrax cases and the proper management of such carcasses. With thanks to Mahmoud. - Mod.MHJ
