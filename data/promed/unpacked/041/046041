Having picked up the following from a message to the list from Torsten Brinch:
"Transmissions of scrapie-like disease from kudu, nyala and *CATS* have
already given closely similar results to BSE, suggesting a common infection
source."
I would like to know if there is more information/literature available
concerning Scrapie-Like disease in cats.

The passage qouted (re: FSE transmission to mice) must be based on
the Fraser, H et al. study: "Transmission of feline spongiform
encephalopathy to mice" Vet.Rec.(1994),134,17,p.449
Information/literature concerning feline spongiform encephalopathy:
I'm afraid that I can't point you to something *really* good:
The article by Grufydd-Jones, Galloway & Pearson
"Feline spongiform encephalopathy", Journ. of Small Animal
Practise (Oct. 1st 1992) 33,10, p 471, offers a brief review
of clinical signs (based on 11 cases). It draws the line to other
TSE's, and it has a few references to previously published cases of FSE.
Another article with the same title appeared in the May 01 1993 issue
of Feline Practise (authors Wyatt, Grufydd-Jones & Pearson).
It may have supplementary information, being slightly more recent.
The most recent article I've seen referenced (I haven't read it)
is the Bratberg, B. article: "Feline spongiform encephalopathy
in a cat in Norway" Vet.Rec. Apr. 29 (1995), 136,17.
It may have references more recent than the articles mentioned above.
Torsten Brinch
P.S. When reading descriptions of the clinical signs of TSE
I can't help thinking of a case of propoxur intoxication
(from flea collars), which I experienced with one of my own
cats 6 months ago.
The symptoms were almost identical to those described for FSE,
and occurred in a cat who habitually groomed the other cats,
shortly after renewal of flea collars. After immediate removal of all
flea collars, the hypermetric gait and the tactile and auditory
hyperaesthesia of this cat normalized within a few days, the head
tremor persisted but gradually disappeared within 2 weeks.
Apparently carbamate poisoning afflicts much the same brain areas as FSE.
T.B.
[- The apparent final total of confirmed FSE cases in the UK is some 72
cases and no new cases have been seen for some while. MHJ]
