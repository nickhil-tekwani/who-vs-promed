The number of cases of syphilis in the United States jumped 10 percent from 2012 to 2013, with gay and bisexual men accounting for 75 percent of the increase, US health officials reported [Tue 16 Dec 2014].

Rates of another sexually transmitted disease -- chlamydia -- fell for the 1st time in 30 years, with more than 1.4 million reported cases in 2013. This represented a 1.5 percent decrease from 2012, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). [The CDC report "Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance 2013" is available at http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats13/surv2013-print.pdf. - Mod.ML]

"There are over 20 million cases of sexually transmitted diseases [STDs] every year in the United States, and they continue to pose a risk of lifelong complications for millions of Americans," said Dr Jonathan Mermin, director of CDC's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention.

According to the report, 17 357 cases of syphilis were reported in 2013 -- a rate of 5.5 per 100 000 people.

There are a variety of reasons that put gay and bisexual men at high risk for syphilis, said Mermin. "Some are the high number of sexual partners and sexual networks that create a vicious cycle where the prevalence of syphilis is higher. And that leads to higher incidence, which leads to higher prevalence, and that cycle can increase the frequency of infection," he said.

Dr Jill Rabin, co-chief of the division of ambulatory care in the Women's Health Programs-PCAP Services at North Shore-LIJ Health System in New Hyde Park, New York, called the increase in syphilis cases "very alarming."

"Syphilis is like the canary in the coal mine for HIV," the virus that causes AIDS, she said. "People are going to be positive for syphilis before they are diagnosed with HIV. This means that there is a potential increase in HIV cases."

The sores caused by syphilis make it easier to get or give someone HIV. If pregnant, syphilis can cause birth defects, or you could lose your baby. In rare cases, syphilis causes serious health problems and even death, according to the US National Institutes of Health.

Syphilis is easy to cure with antibiotics if caught early.

For chlamydia, the infection rate was about 447 per 100 000 people in 2013. Cases of chlamydia remain concentrated among young women, according to the report.

If left untreated, chlamydia can result in severe reproductive health complications, including ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening condition in which the fertilized egg attaches outside the uterus, and infertility.

Infections of a 3rd sexually transmitted disease -- gonorrhea -- remained roughly unchanged from 2012 to 2013, at a rate of 106 per 100 000 people. There were 333 004 reported cases in 2013. Mermin said the rate of drug-resistant gonorrhea has slowed and there is still an effective antibiotic to treat it.

Fred Wyand, a spokesman for the American Sexual Health Association, said the stigma of a sexually transmitted disease shouldn't keep people from being diagnosed and treated.

"Having an STD doesn't mean someone is dirty or broken," he said. "Far from it. One of the great barriers to having sexual health conversations is the sense of embarrassment. People need to have frank, open conversations," he added. "It's not about sex, it's about health."

Cases of primary and secondary syphilis (P&S) in the United States increased, in terms of number of cases, by 10.9 percent from 2012 to 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) annual report, Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance, 2013, which was published today [16 Dec 2014; the CDC report is available at http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats13/surv2013-print.pdf. - Mod.ML]

The updated data shows the number of P&S syphilis cases reported to CDC increased from 15 667 in 2012 to 17 535 in 2013. In addition, the rate of syphilis increased from 5.0 to 5.5 cases per 100 000 population (a 10 percent increase) during 2012-2013. This is the highest recorded case count and rate for P&S syphilis since 1995.

Syphilis remains a major health problem, with increased cases occurring among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). Cases among MSM have been characterized by high rates of HIV co-infection and high-risk sexual behaviors. According to information reported from 49 states and the District of Columbia, 75 percent of P&S syphilis cases are among MSM.

Concerning geography, the South continued to comprise the largest proportion of cases of P&S syphilis in 2013 (40 percent). In 2013, the 15 states and areas (including the District of Columbia) with the highest rates of P&S syphilis accounted for 70 percent of all US cases of P&S syphilis.

The state with the highest rate per 100 000 population was Georgia with 10.3 cases per 100 000. The state with the most P&S syphilis cases was California with 3532, accounting for 20 percent of cases recorded nationally (California was 2nd in rate of syphilis with 9.3 cases per 100 000 population).

Looking at data on race and ethnicity, rates of P&S syphilis remained highest among blacks (16.8 cases per 100 000 population). The rate among blacks was 5.6 times the rate among whites (3.0 cases per 100 000 population).

Primary and secondary syphilis are the earliest stages of infection, reflect symptomatic disease, and are indicators of incident infection.

After decreasing significantly during the 1990s, syphilis in the United States saw it's lowest rate in 2000 since reporting began in 1941. Since then, the rate increased annually during 2001-2009 before decreasing in 2010 and remaining unchanged during 2011. The rate again increased during 2012 and 2013.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that can cause long-term complications if not treated correctly. Symptoms in adults are divided into stages. These stages are primary, secondary, latent, and late syphilis. Syphilis is transmitted via direct contact with a syphilis sore during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Sores can be found on the penis, vagina, anus, in the rectum, or on the lips and in the mouth. Syphilis can also be spread from an infected mother to her unborn baby.

Other STDs featured in the report included chlamydia and gonorrhea. There were 1 401 906 cases of chlamydia reported in the US in 2013. The rate of chlamydia in the country with 446.6 cases per 100 000 population, a decrease of 1.5 percent.

333 004 cases of gonorrhea were reported last year [2013]. Gonorrhea also saw a slight decrease in rate at 0.6 percent.

[ProMED-mail has posted reports of the recent increases in the incidence of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis in many localities in the USA and in many other countries, which is occurring mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM). 75 percent of P&S syphilis cases in the US are among MSM.

Cases among MSM have been characterized by high rates of HIV co-infection and high-risk sexual behaviors. A recent article posted by ProMED-mail reported that HIV-infected MSM seek out other HIV positive sex partners to avoid using condoms, which, of course, would allow transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases among HIV-infected MSM, without resulting in an increase in HIV infections (ProMED-mail post Syphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642).

In addition, the southern region of the US continued to comprise the largest proportion of cases of P&S syphilis in 2013 (40 percent). - Mod.ML
