TB found in Nebraska beef cattle herd
-------------------------------------
Veterinarians have discovered bovine tuberculosis in a herd of beef
cattle in Rock County [Nebraska]. The herd, which is under
quarantine, is in the preliminary stages of testing and an
epidemiological investigation, according to State Veterinarian Dr
Dennis Hughes.

The Nebraska Agriculture Department and the US Agriculture Department
are working with the producer, who is cooperating with the 2 agencies.
The producer was not identified.

"The testing of these animals will take a significant amount of
time," Hughes said Monday [1 Jun 2009]. "It's a big herd."

Veterinarians are working to determine the source of the infection
and the extent of disease has spread. Neighboring landowners are
being contacted to determine if the disease has spread beyond the
original site, Hughes said.

Hughes said consumers have no reason to be concerned about the safety
of beef. All beef cattle are inspected at slaughter by federal
inspectors trained to spot signs of tuberculosis and other diseases.

Rock County is in north-central Nebraska and about 75 miles [120 km]
west of where tuberculosis was found in a captive elk herd earlier
this spring [2009]. Hughes said the Rock County and Knox County cases
are different strains of tuberculosis and the cases are not related.
"These are 2 separate incidents," Hughes said.

Veterinarians tested tissue from 42 wild white-tailed deer near the
elk herd and found no tuberculosis. The collection and testing of
wild deer was done to help determine if the disease organism was
present outside the captive facility.

Tuberculosis is a slow, progressive bacterial disease and is
difficult to diagnose in the early stages. As the disease progresses,
animals may exhibit emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia,
low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. It
usually is transmitted through contact with respiratory secretions
from an infected animal.

[Tuberculosis is a slow insidious disease that can creep in slowly
over a long period of time because the early diagnostic signs are so
very subtle.

It is interesting that the fingerprint of the 2 strains of TB, one in
the captive elk and one in the cattle are so different. Certainly the
Nebraska officials will be carefully working with both herds regarding
testing, and tracing of all animals coming into and leaving the herds.

The question is: Will these 2 separate and unrelated cases, in
different species, put the coveted "TB free state status" at risk of
being diminished? - Mod.TG]
