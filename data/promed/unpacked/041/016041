Hundreds of cattle in Minpya Township upper Pan Myaung Gyi creek in Rakhine state has reportedly died from an unidentified disease during this month [September 2018], according to locals.

Farmers in the region usually sent their cattle, after ploughing season, to the nearby hills and mountains for pasturing. The owners will go up to the hills to check on their cattle once a week. On one of their routine checks, the owners found many dead cattle spread across the area. Some cattle found dead have already started to decay. After inspecting the dead carcasses, no external wounds were found. Locals have assumed that the cattle had died from unidentified disease.

"In our Oo Pyin Taung village, 60 cattle have died. We don't know why our cattle were dying. Our animals were put out to pasture to a place 20 miles [about 32 km] distant from our village which is called Mago creek. Most of the dead animals were large sized cattle. We found that the throats of the animals were swollen. Our villagers hope that government departments will investigate the cause of death as soon as possible. Cattle owners are worried about more of their cattle dying. We couldn't say for sure how many exactly had died because there are no data collected for other villages. I lost 11 cattle," said [a farmer] from Oo Pyin Taung village.

At present, no medical checks for the cattle have been made, increasing the anxiety of cattle owners. An animal is worth Ks 900 000 to 1 000 000 (equivalent of about USD 562 to 625).

[For the location of Minpya (Minbya) in Rakhine state, in the westernmost part of Myanmar, see map at https://goo.gl/maps/vuGhfFbq9Fx.

The media report above provides a few pieces of information which are of relevance to differential diagnosis:
1. The death of a considerable number of cattle took place within a week since the previous weekly visit of animal owners.
2. The affected cattle were, mainly, "large sized cattle".
3. The (only) external lesion which was observed by the owners was "swollen throats".
4. No clinical signs were seen (or reported??), probably indicative of the acuteness of the condition.

Applying Cornell university's "Consultant" search machine (Diagnostic Support System for Veterinary Medicine; http://consultant.vet.cornell.edu/), using the 2 signs "Neck swelling, mass cervical region" and "Sudden death, found dead" in bovines, 28 diagnoses, infectious and non-infectious, were suggested. Among the more acute infectious diseases, anthrax and clostridial diseases (such as, malignant edema, blackleg, gas gangrene) deserve particular attention.

Earlier in 2018, human cases of anthrax were reported from Myanmar; see Mod.MHJ's commentary in 20180525.5819426.

Information on any findings, if they become available, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
