A Commentary from Dr. Brian Hjelle
-----------------------------------
It is disturbing to see certain "urban legend" concepts that appear
repeatedly in subjects about which one has some degree of specialized
knowledge. In part this is because such statements mislead people
about the epidemiology of the disease one knows, and in part it is
because it raises worries about the quality of the information one
receives concerning subjects about which one has less specialized
knowledge.
The 4 May 2002 report about what may be a recent case of hantavirus
cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in Utah raises such issues [see
ProMED-mail post: Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - USA (Utah)
20020505.4105. - Mod.CP].
Two matters caught my attention in this report. First we are told that:
"The Director of the Central Utah Public Health Department stated that
the (patient) went camping the weekend before he was hospitalized...".
then; "it was not immediately clear if the (patient) was exposed to
hantavirus while camping somewhere near the Dirty Devil River and
the Wayne/Garfield County line, the Director said, or if he was infected
while working outdoors in his hometown or near his family's mobile
home." These statements have the unintended effect of perpetuating
certain misconceptions that one encounters on a regular basis in the
world of zoonotic diseases, which makes their appearance in the media
especially frustrating.
Determining the date of exposure to a zoonotic pathogen like Sin
Nombre virus (SNV) is often very difficult. Many patients have an
ongoing exposure to potentially infected deer mice (_Peromyscus
maniculatus_) in or near their homes or even their workplaces. Very
few patients are exposed to SNV through recreational activities like
camping (refs. 1,2). Only in exceptional circumstances is it possible to
determine a date of exposure with precision, such as when a patient
moves from one region to another and one is able to compare the
genotype of SNV that is recovered from the patient with those that are
in circulation at the candidate sites of exposure (ref. 3). When the few
cases for which such specific conditions exist are considered
collectively, one arrives at an incubation period ranging from 9 to 33
days (ref. 4) -- almost certainly too long to account for the
hospitalization of a patient exposed while "camping" only the weekend
before.
But the most disturbing single phrase in the Salt Lake Tribune report
was this: "...he was infected while working outdoors...". We began
investigating this phenomenon of "outdoor" exposure years ago after
we noticed a disconnection between what patients were reporting to us
about their exposure histories and what was being recorded on case
report forms by seemingly disinterested interviewers. While the patients
were essentially universally reporting exposures inside buildings and/or
in closed sheds and poorly-ventilated outbuildings, some interviewers
were nevertheless reporting that contacts with hantaviruses came while
patients were "camping" or "hiking". We began to realize that the
standard questionnaires, as used in practice by public health workers,
were frequently not detecting the extraordinarily common indoor
exposures that were probably leading to infection. We reported our
observations in ref. 2 below.
In our series of cases from Four Corners States, 34 of 37 evaluable
cases followed a predominantly indoor exposure, 1 case presented
equally compelling indoor and outdoor exposure histories, and 2 others
reported solely outdoor exposures. Of the 2 "outdoor exposure" cases,
one was a contractor who was technically standing outside a house for
an extended period of time as he ripped visibly rodent-contaminated
insulation directly into his face in the absence of respiratory protection.
The other was a person who was simply not accessible to interview by
us, and for whom the case investigator simply asserted, based upon a
note in his interview form that the infection was contracted "outdoors".
The concept that one can contract SNV simply by walking in the
woods, by gardening, or by "camping", seems to have a life of its own.
It may date back, in part, to some of the earlier literature wherein an
association was noted between being an "agriculture worker" and
having a high risk for hantavirus infection. This observation was
somehow translated into the concept that "harvesting or planting crops"
was itself a proximate risk factor, allowing one to ignore any
consideration of the conditions in the places where the patient ate, or
where he or she slept at night.
Later, in the face of multiple outdated questionnaire questions applied
uncritically to a tiny group comprised of the first few patients with
SNV infection, questionable associations like "hand plowing" began to
appear as risk factors in the US literature. We believe, based on our
study (ref. 2) and on our investigations of scores of other us cases of
HCPS, that indoor exposures dwarf outdoor exposures as risk factors
for infection.
The standardized epidemiologic questionnaire is an essential part of
modern epidemiologic investigation. It is vastly preferable to use
standardized methods to the fullest extent possible when conducting
epidemiologic investigations. That said, the quality of the questionnaire
is critical, because statistical theory tells us that if one asks enough
questions of marginal or no relevance, eventually one will come across
a false association. If that false association takes on a life of its own,
many subsequent studies can be weakened. One must be able to use
common sense, and most of all, one must be able to revise and update
questionnaires and interviewing methods in the face of new, hard data,
even if it means that some of the older data will essentially become
discarded.
