Jaundice outbreak in Maharashtra: 12 dead, 3000 affected
-------------------------------------------------
More than 500 new cases of jaundice have been reported from the textile town of Ichalkaranji in Kolhapur district in the last 4 days and the disease has killed at least 12 people in the last one month, officials said on Monday [18 Jun 2012].

Kolhapur health department suspect that the consumption of contaminated water from the Panchganga river by the people is the cause behind the recent rise in cases of jaundice in Ichalkaranji. "Since 15 May 2012, there have been 3803 cases of jaundice in the city and so far 12 people have already succumbed to the disease," a city health official told IANS [Indo-Asian News Service]. Ichalkaranji is 40 km [24.8 miles] from the district headquarters of Kolhapur and 450 km [280 miles] from Mumbai. On Thursday [14 Jun 2012] Reuters News Agency reported that the figure of those infected with jaundice stood at 3300 patients. With 503 new cases in the past 4 days, the figure has risen to 3803 patients.

Over 1500 patients have been treated and discharged since Fri 15 May 2012, while over 300 patients are still under medical care in hospitals across the city. Over 70 pregnant women have also been hit with jaundice so far, the official said. A pregnant doctor and a government official had also succumbed to jaundice. All schools have been declared closed till Fri 22 Jun 2012.

The town gets it water supply from 2 rivers namely the Panchganga and Krishna rivers. "Water supply from Krishna has been stopped since last 2 months owing to repair work and we suspect that the contaminated water from the Panchganga river is the cause of the disease," Dr Harshala Vedak, Kolhapur's district health officer told IANS.

[No specific diagnosis is mentioned but the suspicion is that this extensive outbreak may be due to contamination of river water suggesting that the outbreak is a consequence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection. HEV infection has been responsible for outbreaks of jaundice in India in the past. Hepatitis E is caused by infection with hepatitis E virus, a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Humans are considered to be the natural host for HEV, although antibodies to HEV or closely related viruses have been detected in primates and several other animal species. The highest rates of infection occur in regions where low standards of sanitation promote the transmission of the virus. Epidemics of hepatitis E have been reported in India, South-East Asia, North and West Africa, and in Mexico, especially where faecal contamination of drinking water is common. The risk factors for HEV infection are poor sanitation. Person-to-person transmission is uncommon and there is no evidence of sexual transmission.

In general, hepatitis E is a self-limiting infection followed by recovery. Prolonged viraemia or faecal shedding are unusual and chronic infection does not occur. Occasionally, a fulminant form of hepatitis develops, with overall patient population mortality rates ranging between 0.5% - 4.0 percent. Fulminate hepatitis occurs more frequently in pregnancy and regularly induces a mortality rate of 20 percent among pregnant women in the 3rd trimester. The incubation period following exposure to HEV ranges from 3 to 8 weeks, with a mean of 40 days. The period of communicability is unknown. No chronic infections have been reported. HEV infections are usually self-limited, and hospitalization is generally not required. No available therapy is capable of altering the course of acute infection, and no protective vaccine is available yet.
