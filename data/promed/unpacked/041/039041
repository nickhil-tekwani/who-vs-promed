Preliminary Public Health Notification - Fungal Keratitis Infections
Related to Contact Lens Use 10 Apr 2006
-------------------
Dear Healthcare Practitioner:
This is to inform you of a recent increase in the number of reports
in the United States of a rare but serious fungal infection of the
eye in soft contact lens wearers. The infection, a fungal keratitis
caused by the Fusarium fungus, may cause vision loss requiring
corneal transplants.
Both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are investigating this
situation. At this time, Bausch and Lomb has agreed to stop shipping
the ReNu MoistureLoc brand contact lens solution. This Notification
will be updated as more information becomes available.
Current Testing
-------
In an MMWR Dispatch dated 10 Apr 2006, CDC stated that it received
reports of 109 cases of suspected fungal keratitis in 17 different
states. Although the majority of case patients have yet to be
interviewed, complete data are available for 30 of them, of whom 28
wore soft contact lenses. Preliminary information obtained by CDC
from patient interviews indicates that 26 of these patients
remembered which products they used, and that all 26 reported using a
Bausch & Lomb ReNu brand contact lens solution in the month prior to
the onset of infection. Patients reported using a variety of
different ReNu types from multiple different product lots. Five
reported using other solutions in addition to the ReNu product. Nine
reported wearing lenses overnight, a known risk factor for microbial
keratitis. Eight required corneal transplantation. Strain typing of
the organism is ongoing.
CDC and FDA are investigating these case reports. Also,
investigations by CDC, state and local health departments, FDA, and
manufacturers of contact lens solutions are underway to define
specific behaviors or products that place contact lens wearers at
increased risk for Fusarium keratitis.
Clusters of Fusarium keratitis were reported among contact lens users
in Asia beginning in February 2006. At that time, Bausch & Lomb
voluntarily suspended sales of its ReNu multipurpose solutions in
Singapore and Hong Kong, pending their investigations, after multiple
reports of Fusarium keratitis among contact lens users there.
Background on Microbial Keratitis
----------------
Microbial keratitis is a severe infection of the cornea. Risk factors
for infection include trauma (generally with plant material), chronic
ocular surface diseases, immunodeficiency, and rarely, contact lens
use. There are an estimated 30 million soft contact lens users in the
United States; the annual incidence of microbial keratitis is
estimated to be 4-21 per 10 000 soft contact lens users, depending on
overnight lens use. Fungal keratitis is more prevalent in warm
climates; in the southernmost United States, fungal keratitis
comprises up to 35 percent of microbial keratitis cases compared with
1 percent in New York. The proportion of fungal keratitis due to
Fusarium spp. also varies by region, from 25-62 percent.
Recommendations:
For healthcare providers:
- If a patient presents with a microbial keratitis, consider that a
fungal infection may be involved and obtain a specimen for laboratory
analysis.
- Refer patients to an ophthalmologist for immediate treatment.
- Report cases of fungal keratitis in contact lens wearers to FDA as
noted below.
For contact lens wearers:
- Wash hands with soap and water, and dry (lint-free method) before
handling lenses.
- Wear and replace lenses according to the schedule prescribed by the doctor.
- Follow the specific lens cleaning and storage guidelines from the
doctor and the solution manufacturer.
- Keep the contact lens case clean and replace every 3-6 months.
- Remove the lenses and consult your doctor immediately if you
experience symptoms such as redness, pain, tearing, increased light
sensitivity, blurry vision, discharge or swelling.
In addition, regardless of which cleaning/disinfecting solution used,
wearers may want to consider performing a 'rub and rinse' lens
cleaning method, rather than a no-rub method, in order to minimize
the number of germs and reduce the chances of infection.

Reporting Adverse Events
--------------
FDA and CDC are very interested in gathering information related to
fungal keratitis in contact lens users. We encourage you to report
these infections to FDA. FDA will be sharing reported information
with CDC. You can report directly to MedWatch, the FDA's voluntary
reporting program. You may submit reports to MedWatch by phone at
1-800-FDA-1088; by FAX at 1-800-FDA-0178; by mail to MedWatch, Food
and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857-9787;
or online at <http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm>.
Please include the following information (if available) on the
MedWatch reporting form:
- Contact lens solutions trade names and lot numbers.
- Contact lens type, trade name and mode of wear (extended or daily wear).
- Patient non-compliance with contact lens regimen (e.g., overnight
wear in daily wear lenses, not cleaning lenses).
- Results of all cultures taken (e.g., corneal, conjunctival, contact
lens, care solutions, lens case).
- Special patient characteristics, including whether the patient was
immunocompromised (e.g., used topical or systemic corticosteroids or
had diabetes), or had any ocular trauma, surgery, or chronic eye
problem.
- Topical ocular medications used to treat the patient (including
trade names and lot number if available).

[While most of the above information was included in yesterday's
ProMED-mail posting (Fusarium keratitis - Asia, USA (02)
20060410.1074), the new information is the voluntary cessation of
shipping of Bausch and Lomb's ReNu MoistureLoc contact lens solution.
It should be noted that this is not a recall notice, so the product
still on retail outlet shelves remains available for sale and use. As
more data are clearly needed (information was available for only 30
of the 109 cases identified to date, or 28 percent), the "verdict" on
the etiology of this increase in fusarium keratitis is not as yet
definitively in. We await further information as it becomes
available. - Mod.MPP]
