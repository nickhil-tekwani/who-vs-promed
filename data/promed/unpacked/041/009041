[You may have noticed the disparity in dates in the opening information. Yes, this was an outbreak that occurred on the 4 May 2018. This is an anniversary report, one year later, on what was done and achieved. There was a thorough investigation at the time and a ring-vaccination involving some 21 110 cattle, and no further cases. An outstanding and successful response. - Mod.MHJ
