I wonder if you received my posting on dengue and DHF here in East Timor,
which I sent two days ago. You have been asking for a formal report - I am
responsible for the WHO disease surveillance system here, and I prepared
the following summary in collaboration with the UNTAET/East Timorese
Interim Health Authority. In case my message went astray in cyberspace,
here it is again, and I will be happy to correspond more if you wish.
By the way, we in the WHO office in Dili have been writing a Weekly
Epidemiological Bulletin for East Timor since week 45 of 1999, and have
been distributing it to an e-mail list for more than a month. If you would
like me to add ProMED to the list, let me know.
Here is a formal report of dengue in East Timor, to respond to some of the
issues raised in recent postings:
Dengue is hyperendemic in East Timor, (by which we mean all four serotypes
of the dengue virus are circulating) and has been so for some years.
In 1997 there was a large outbreak of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), as
usual mostly affecting children. Since then there have been sporadic cases
each year.
This year (in fact since the crisis in September 1999) is the first time
that very large numbers of non-immune adults have been in the country
during the high incidence wet season. These have been mostly in the large
military force (originally called InterFET, and now the UNTAET Peace
Keeping Force), and the staff of UNTAET and the UN agencies, as well as the
many international NGOs assisting the country.
A number of cases of dengue, and a much smaller number of cases of DHF,
have been reported in this group of expatriates. The military contingent
reports 228 cases of serologically confirmed dengue between late September
and early February, with peak incidence in late January. The Centre for
Disease Control in Darwin reports 56 cases of dengue in people arriving
from East Timor during the same period, and with a similar peak in January.
It is much more difficult to estimate the incidence in the general
population, as serological confirmation of the diagnosis is not widely
available. There have been a total of seven cases of DHF reported by health
agencies in East Timorese patients, between early February and now. Six
were children under 10 years of age, and one a 35-year-old man. All but two
cases were reported from Dili, and the other two from Bobonaro district.
The total number of simple dengue cases is unknown.
Various control measures have been implemented, coordinated by the Timorese
Interim Health Authority and with the support of several agencies. These
have mostly focussed on reduction of the vectors, _Aedes aegypti_ and
_Aedes albopictus_. There has been an educational campaign via the schools,
to educate the public on the reduction of larval habitats around the home.
In summary, dengue is certainly endemic in East Timor. The main difference
this year has been the presence of so many non-immune adults from other
countries. There has so far not been a large outbreak of dengue
haemorrhagic fever, but the risk is recognised and control measures are in
place.
One final comment: it is no longer appropriate to refer to East Timor as
part of Indonesia, as in the subject line of some recent postings.

report, but following it up when it got lost! We would be glad to receive
one copy of his weekly report for reposting to our readers - Mod. JW
