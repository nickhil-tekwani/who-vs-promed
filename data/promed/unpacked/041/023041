[Responding to ProMED/MBDS Dengue - Cambodia (04)20120516.1119 posted on 16 May, identical to report published on this list today, 19 May. - ProMED]

As a non-medic travelling in Cambodia's countryside, I think the
reports of infections are completely underestimating the pandemic
currently going on.

In one village alone in the province of Preah Vihear I have counted at
least 700 cases of infections since January 2012.

Extrapolate this to the whole province and you easily have 40 000 or
more cases of infections that will very soon occur also in the rest of
the country thanks to the newly built roads and increased movement of
people.

Many strong men are unable to work due to month-long severe arthritis.

People have died directly or indirectly.

[ProMED thanks Fabio Napoletano for providing his 1st-hand
observations. There is a clear need for health authorities to follow
up on the outbreak that is going on, with epidemiological surveillance
and good laboratory support.

Although persistent athralgia is typical of chikungunya virus
infections, because the acute clinical signs of dengue and chikungunya
are otherwise similar, laboratory diagnosis will be essential,
especially if fatalities are occurring. Reports of fatalities from
chikungunya virus infections are very rare, so one hopes that the
cause of deaths in this outbreak in Cambodia are determined. - Mod.TY
