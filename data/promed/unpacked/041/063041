Increase in Coccidioidomycosis --- Arizona, 1998-2001
--------------------------------------------
Coccidioidomycosis is a systemic infection caused by inhalation of airborne
spores from _Coccidioides immitis_, a fungus found in soil in the
southwestern United States and in parts of Mexico and Central and South
America (1). Infection occurs usually following activities or natural
events that disrupt the soil, resulting in aerosolization of the fungal
arthrospores (2). Clinical manifestations occur in 40 percent of infected
persons and range from an influenza-like illness (ILI) to severe pneumonia
and, rarely, extrapulmonary disseminated disease (3).
Persons at higher risk for disseminated disease include blacks, Filipinos,
pregnant women in their third trimester, and immunocompromised persons (4).
During 2001, the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) reported a
coccidioidomycosis incidence of 43 cases per 100 000 population,
representing an increase of 186 percent since 1995 (3). To characterize
this increase, CDC analyzed data from the National Electronic
Telecommunications System for Surveillance (NETSS) and the Arizona Hospital
Discharge Database (AHDD), and environmental and climatic data, and
conducted a cohort study of a random sample of patients with
coccidioidomycosis. This report summarizes the findings of this
investigation, which indicate that the recent Arizona coccidioidomycosis
epidemic is attributed to seasonal peaks in incidence that probably are
related to climate. Healthcare providers in Arizona should be aware that
peak periods of coccidioidomycosis incidence occur during the winter and
should consider testing patients with ILI.
Surveillance and Hospitalizations:
Coccidioidomycosis became a nationally reportable disease at the southwest
regional level through NETSS in 1995, at which time a case definition was
adopted that required laboratory confirmation*. During 1997, laboratory
reporting of coccidioidomycosis became mandatory in Arizona, after which a
marked increase was noted in the number of reported cases. However,
incidence continued to increase in subsequent years. NETSS data for
1998-2001 were analyzed to calculate incidence by using U.S. Census 2000
data for denominators.
During 2001, a total of 2203 cases were reported to ADHS (rate: 43 cases
per 100 000 population), compared with 1551 cases in 1998 (rate: 33).
Persons aged >65 years had the highest incidence (79 during 2001), although
incidence in all age groups increased. The youngest age groups experienced
the largest increase in incidence during the surveillance period: during
2001, incidence of coccidioidomycosis among patients aged <20 years
increased 121 percent, from approximately 5 in 1998 to 11 in 2001.
Analysis by season demonstrated peak periods of disease incidence during
the winter months (November-February) (Figure 1). The baseline rate between
peak periods was stable, indicating that the seasonal periods were
responsible for the overall annual increase in reported cases. AHDD was
reviewed to identify patients with a primary or secondary discharge
diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis (International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision codes 114.0-114.3 and 114.5-114.9).
Hospitalizations caused by coccidioidomycosis increased substantially
during the study period. During 2001, a total of 598 persons were
discharged with a primary or secondary diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis,
compared with 69 persons during 1998; 154 (26 percent) of the 598
hospitalized patients had disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Persons aged >65
years comprised 34 percent of all hospitalized patients during the study
period and had the highest rate of hospitalization (29 per 100 000
population during 2001).
Cohort Study:
To explain peak periods and to further characterize the epidemic, CDC
conducted a cohort study of patients from NETSS who had coccidioidomycosis
to evaluate host factors, exposures, and outcomes.
Patients reported with coccidioidomycosis were divided into 4 groups based
on inclusion in peak or nonpeak periods and year of disease. Of 208
randomly selected persons contacted by telephone, 196 (94 percent)
completed a questionnaire (range per group: 43-56 persons). No
statistically significant differences were found between groups related to
host risk factors or exposures that could explain the large peak seasons.
Geographic Information Systems:
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software was used to identify areas of
high incidence in Maricopa County, the most populous county in Arizona.
Locations of patients identified in NETSS and AHDD were plotted by postal
code by using Arc View v3.2, and incidence was calculated by using U.S.
Census 2000 data. The highest incidence of coccidioidomycosis for both
NETSS cases and hospitalizations occurred in areas surrounding metropolitan
Phoenix (Figure 2). These areas have experienced substantial construction
activity according to building permit data provided by the Maricopa County
Association of Governments. Seasonal variations in construction activity
approximated by building permits were not significantly associated with
cases (Table).
Environment and Climate:
Arizona has been experiencing dry weather conditions recently.
Environmental and climatic data were analyzed in relation to incidence of
disease, and Poisson regression was performed to construct a model that
might predict seasonal peaks. Many climatic variables were significantly
associated with increased incidence of disease, including drought indices
(Palmer Z Index and Palmer Drought Severity Index), wind velocity, mean
temperature, dust (measured by concentration of suspended particulate
matter <10 microns), and rain (Table). Poisson regression analysis
indicated a high correlation (R-squared = 0.75) between incidence of
disease and 1) cumulative rain during the preceding 7 months, 2) the
average temperature during the preceding 3 months, 3) dust during the
preceding month, and 4) the amount of rain during the preceding 2 months in
proportion to the preceding 7 months. The projected cases based on the
model were compared with the actual cases in Maricopa County (Figure 1).
The model accurately mirrored peak seasonal periods during 1998-1999, in
particular the large peak beginning in November 2001. In addition, the
model accurately described the absence of a seasonal peak during winter
2000-01.

Editorial Note:
Coccidioidomycosis is the fourth most common infectious disease reported to
ADHS; only gonorrhea, chlamydia, and chronic hepatitis C are more frequent
(ADHS, unpublished data, 2002). The findings in this report indicate that
the incidence of coccidioidomycosis in Arizona has increased substantially
since 1998, affecting all age groups. In addition, hospitalizations for
coccidioidomycosis have increased, indicating an increase in the numbers of
persons with severe disease. Although seasonality of coccidioidomycosis in
Arizona has been suggested previously, this study is the first to confirm
the pattern (5,6). In addition, this study documents peak incidence periods
during November-February; improved timeliness and completeness of reporting
because of mandatory laboratory reporting since 1997 might have helped
reveal the seasonal pattern. Seasonal fluctuations could not be explained
by differences in the prevalence of the various host risk factors or
exposures but were significantly associated with climatic and environmental
factors. A climate model incorporating some of these factors recreated the
seasonal outbreaks in Maricopa county and predicted that large outbreak
seasons might occur during winter seasons following prolonged drought
periods, especially in conjunction with hot and dusty conditions. These
conditions, which might facilitate aerosolization of arthrospores, have
been described in studies of coccidioidomycosis epidemics in California
(7). Dry and dusty conditions continue in Arizona, suggesting that another
large peak season might occur this winter. Preliminary data for 2002
indicate that the number of total cases already exceeds 3000, considerably
surpassing 2001 levels (ADHS, unpublished data, 2002). Although
coccidioidomycosis is not readily preventable, a better understanding of
its epidemiology can assist in developing more effective prevention and
education strategies and help with earlier diagnosis and appropriate
medical management. Healthcare providers should consider testing for
coccidioidomycosis in any patient who has moved or traveled recently to
Arizona and who has ILI, especially during the winter months. Dust
reduction measures, such as paving roads or wetting soil at construction
sites, are currently in place and might be useful in preventing further
cases. Persons at risk for severe disease should avoid activities that
might increase their exposure to dust. These persons might benefit from
development of a vaccine that confers long-term immunity (6).
