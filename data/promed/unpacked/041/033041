The Greater Western Area Health Service says there has been an
increase in cases of Ross River fever across the region in the past 2 months.
Population health manager Dr Tony Brown says 20 people have caught
the disease this month and 36 people had it in December [2005]. He
says it could be due to an increased number of mosquitoes, so people
should take precautions like spraying, installing screens and
covering the body at dusk and early in the morning.
"People haven't actually reported that there have been lots more
mosquitoes, but I'd anticipate that the wet period that we had sort
of at the end of November 2005 and things has left little pools of
water lying around that have allowed the mosquitoes to breed," he said.

Another 18 cases of Ross River Virus have been reported to health
authorities in a week.
Health Authorities reported last Friday that 42 new cases of Ross
River Virus had been recorded in the previous 6 weeks compared with
just 7 for the same time last year [2005].
Dr Ann Koehler, of the communicable diseases branch, said the number
had grown again this week, bringing the total number of cases to 60
in a little over 7 weeks.
"The virus can be quite severe." Dr Koehler said, "causing swollen
joints, aches, pains and fever, which can last months and even years
[rarely]. I expect we will see more cases."
Ross River virus disease -- sometimes called Epidemic Polyarthritis
-- is spread by mosquito bite. There is no treatment.
In 2005, 94 cases of Ross River Virus were reported compared to 57
the year before [2004], while 26 cases of the similar Barmah Forest
Virus were reported compared to 6 in 2004.
Authorities are urging people to cover up and use insect repellents
containing DEET or picaridin on exposed skin to avoid infection.

Meningie stung by virus outbreak
------------------
More than 20 Meningie residents have been infected with Ross River
Virus in just 6 weeks, including children.
Meningie now accounts for nearly half of all cases reported across
the State [South Australia] since the start of December [2006],
prompting Health Department calls for people to cover up against mosquitoes.
For the same period last year, just 7 cases were reported in South Australia.
Warm and wet weather conditions in 2005 provided a perfect breeding
ground for virus-carrying mosquitoes, and in some areas, including
Meningie, they have reached uncontrollable proportions.
Because of this, Meningie general practitioner Dr Michael Kerrigan
said the number of cases was not unexpected.
However he said it was a wake-up call for local residents who had
become complacent about the threat of infection from mosquitoes.
"Are they aware of the disease? Yes. Do they do anything to protect
themselves against it? Probably not," Dr Kerrigan said.
"The take-home message here is, if you are going to be out and about
after dark, have the spray-on deterrent and cover up to avoid the bites.
"It's a nasty disease and can be quite debilitating in some people."
Ross River Virus presents flu-like symptoms, accompanied with joint pains.
While it usually only lasts about 6 weeks - if it presents symptoms
at all - some people will have recurring bouts of Ross River Virus
for many years after being infected.
In severe cases it can even cause ongoing depression and fatigue.
And while locals were likely to have the disease diagnosed quickly,
Dr Kerrigan said he was concerned tourists from Adelaide would
contract the disease and go undiagnosed by metropolitan doctors,
simply because the disease was rarely seen in large cities.
Acting director of the Department of Health's communicable disease
control branch Dr Jane Raupach said this was an issue the department
was aware of, and said efforts were being made to warn tourists of
the risks mosquitoes posed.

[Ross River virus (RRV) fever, or epidemic benign polyarthritis, is a
viral infection. RRV was first isolated from _Aedes vigilax_
mosquitoes collected in 1959 near the Ross River in Townsville
(Australia). The cause was confirmed in 1971 by its isolation from
the blood of an Aboriginal boy with the disease. RRV belongs to the
genus _Alphavirus_ of the family _Togaviridae_.
Ross River virus infection can be transmitted to humans by the bite
of an infected mosquito. The incidence rate is less than 30
percent. It generally results in a self-limiting flu-like non-fatal
illness, but it can cause long-term joint pain and fatigue. Symptoms
disappear eventually and leave few or no after-effects. Most people
who have been exposed to RRV are immune for life. There is no vaccine
and no specific treatment for Ross River virus infection, but
treatment of symptoms can reduce discomfort. Medical treatment is
aimed at easing joint pains and swelling, and minimizing fatigue and lethargy.
A variety of mosquito species can transmit RRV, biting day and/or
night. For instance, in Australia the following species have been
found to be RRV carriers:
_Aedes vigilax_, a salt marsh mosquito, bites day and night.
_Aedes normanensis_, a floodwater mosquito, bites by day in the shade
and at night.
_Culex annulirostris_ breeds in shallow water and bites after sundown
and at night.
_Aedes notoscriptus_, found only in urban areas where it breeds in
artificial receptacles, bites during the day in the shade and at night.
Ross River virus fever is found in all States and Territories of
Australia, but occurs more often in the northern States and in
coastal areas. Infection can occur year-round, but is more common
from late November to the end of April, during the wet season when
mosquito activity increases. Ross River virus is also found in Papua,
New Guinea, areas of Indonesia and the Western Pacific islands. - Mod.RY]
