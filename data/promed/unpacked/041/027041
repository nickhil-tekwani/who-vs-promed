A 4th child has fallen ill with a mystery virus that is suspected to
have killed 2 children and left one in serious condition, health
officials said Thursday [21 Aug 2008].

The latest patient, a 3-year-old boy, was admitted to hospital
Tuesday [19 Aug 2008] with fever and vomiting. His condition worsened
after convulsions, and he fell into a coma, the Centre for Health
Protection said. His condition was said to be critical on Thursday
[21 Aug 2008], with signs of blood poisoning and brain abnormalities.
Health officials are already conducting an investigation into the
illnesses after the deaths last week of 2 girls, 9 and 3, who
suffered from inflammation of the heart and blood poisoning.

A 3rd girl, 7, is in critical condition, suffering from brain
inflammation. Thomas Tsang Ho-fai, controller of the Centre for
Health Protection, said it was not known whether one single virus or
different viruses were responsible and an investigation was ongoing.
In the meantime, he reminded parents to pay close attention to their
children's health and seek medical help if they developed persistent
high fever, vomiting or convulsions.

In March 2008, the government closed all Hong Kong primary schools
and kindergartens after the deaths of 2 children caused panic among
parents who remembered the grim days of the 2003 outbreak of SARS, or
severe acute respiratory syndrome, which killed 299 and infected 1755
in Hong Kong. It brought the return of surgical-style face masks,
which were sold by the millions and worn on the streets, in schools
and in workplaces during the SARS outbreak.

An investigation into the March 2008 illnesses revealed the deaths
were not the result of a virulent virus but strains of the H1N1 and
H3N2 [seasonal influenza] Brisbane viruses, which had been
circulating in different parts of the world earlier this year [2008].
As well as SARS, Hong Kong saw the world's 1st modern-day outbreak of
bird flu in 1997, when the virus infected 18 people, killing 6 of them.

[The young age of the patients and the predominance of symptoms of
blood poisoning and neurological damage suggest the involvement of
one or more enteroviruses. Earlier in the year (2008), Hong Kong was
affected by the epidemic of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) that
involved children throughout much of Asia. The occurrence of HFMD is
indicative of the existence of conditions favoring transmission of
enteroviruses and the production of disease in infants and children
lacking prior exposure to these agents.

Further information would be welcomed.
