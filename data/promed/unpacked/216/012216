5 children contract polio from vaccine
--------------------------------------
>From being labelled the world's lone polio exporter in 2006 to
reporting just one positive case till the 8th month of this year
[2011], the polio scenario has never looked better for India. But
celebrations are not in offing as the country is now faced with the
challenge of fighting the vaccine derived poliovirus [VDPV] rather
than the wild virus itself.

Simply put, the small quantity of the weakened poliovirus present in
the oral polio vaccine [OPV] (to activate immune response) is the one
seemingly causing polio in children now. At least, 5 children from
Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Rajasthan, [Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh]
have been struck by the vaccine derived polio, whereas only one child
from West Bengal has tested positive for the wild poliovirus. The
child from Chhattisgarh, who had a congenital anomaly and was highly
immunodeficient, recently died. There were 21 cases of vaccine derived
polio in 2009 that came down to 6 in 2010.

But, experts are of the view that even though cases of vaccine derived
polio are a cause of worry, it is not as scary as the wild poliovirus
that India has been fighting for decades. A senior official from the
ministry of health and family welfare, New Delhi, told TOI, "We are
aware of the vaccine derived poliovirus cases. But, all the 5 cases
are isolated and they do not seem to be circulating the virus in the
community," the official said. He, however, admitted the virus in the
vaccine can "mutate" and cause paralysis. "But, it is much easier to
bring vaccine derived polio under control," the official said.

Yet, some experts say the government should have been better prepared
for such a scenario as it was alerted at least a decade back that
there will be a stage when vaccine derived virus will be a bigger
danger. Former chairman of the India Expert Advisory Group Dr T Jacob
John said vaccine derived polio has a tendency to "become wild-like",
and experts had informed the policy-makers about it long ago. He,
however, added that India not reporting any wild poliovirus from
environment sampling in the last 8 months is a very positive sign.

According to sources in the health ministry, deliberations are on as
to how to tackle this. Since all the 5 cases of vaccine derived polio
are of type II [2] strain, there were discussions of stopping the
trivalent immunizations (dosage for all 3 polio strains) for a while
so that the type II virus is not fed in the community. But, the idea
was soon aborted thinking it could lead to an outbreak in the
low-immune population. "The situation is more like a double-edged
sword now," said Dr John, adding that benefits of OPV still outweigh
cases of vaccine derived poliovirus.

[The newswire above refers to the 5 additional paralytic cases
reported in 2011 as being due to infection with vaccine derived
polioviruses (VDPV). The newswire also mentions that these cases are
sporadic, and not associated with "circulating vaccine derived
poliovirus (VDPV)". More detailed information on each of the cases was
not provided so that it was not clear to this moderator if these cases
were classified as VAPP (vaccine associated paralytic polio) cases,
where the individuals were those who developed paralysis after
directly receiving a dose of the oral polio vaccine (OPV), versus
those individuals who did not have a history of recent receipt of a
dose of OPV, but had paralytic disease where a vaccine derived
poliovirus was obtained from stool specimens. In the latter instance,
the cases would be classified as associated with circulating VDPV
(cVDPV).

According to Andrus and colleagues, the rate of VAPP in Latin America
during the period 1989-1991 was found to be one case per 1.5-2.2
million doses of vaccine administered, compared with 1 case per 2.5
million doses distributed in the USA during the period 1980-1989, and
1.4 doses of vaccine administered in England and Wales during the
period 1985-1991 (Andrus JK, Strebel PM, deCuadros CA, Olive JM. Risk
of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis in Latin America,
1989-91. Bull World Health Organ. 1995; 73(1): 33-40;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2486585).

The Technical Consultative Group to the WHO on the eradication of
polio gives an estimated rate of VAPP as 1 case per 1 million live
births (see Technical Consultative Group to the World Health
Organization on the Global Eradication of Poliomyelitis. "Endgame"
issues for the global polio eradication initiative. Clin Inf Dis.
2002; 34(1): 72-7;
http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/1/72.long.) (For an
interesting discussion on these estimates in India, see Jacob John's
letter to the editor Vaccine associated paralytic polio in India, Bull
World Health Organ. 2002, 80(11): 917;
http://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/80%2811%29917.pdf).

With respect to cVDPV, according to data available on the Global Polio
Eradication Initiative website, during the period 2000-2011, 77 cases
due to cVDPV-1 have been reported (cases reported from Mozambique,
Myanmar, Indonesia, China, Philippines and DOR/Haiti), 442 cases due
to cVDPV-2 (cases reported from Nigeria, Somalia, Afghanistan, Chad,
DR Congo, Niger, India, Ethiopia, and Madagascar), and 9 cases due to
cVDPV-3 (cases reported from Ethiopia and Cambodia). (Of note,
according to the data available on the Polio Eradication Initiative
website, the most recent cVDPV-2 virus isolated in India was on 18 Jan
2010 -- the 5 cases mentioned above have not been included in the
database (see
http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Circulatingvaccinederivedpoliovirus.aspx
for tables with number of cases by country, year, and VDPV virus
type.) In addition, only 2 cases of VDPV were reported from India in
2010.

On further investigation, this moderator found that according to the
data available on the Indian National Polio Surveillance Project
(NPSP) website, there have been 5 cases of VDPV associated paralytic
disease in 2011 -- one each in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab,
Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh as mentioned in the newswire above.
(http://www.npspindia.org/bulletin.pdf). With respect to VAPP cases,
according to the NPSP data, there have been 573 type 1, 397 type 2,
612 type 3, and 480 mixed vaccine virus types isolated in 2011 as of
the week ending 30 Jul 2011, in association with acute flaccid
paralysis cases. Hence, the "apparent" discrepancy is most likely
related to the definition of cVDPV as a VDPV associated with at least
2 cases, whereas the VDPV cases in India in 2011 are single,
non-related cases.

Of note, there have been no cases of paralytic polio due to infection
with WPV-2 (wild poliovirus type 2) since October 1999. Looking at a
risk benefit assessment, it appears as though the risk of paralytic
polio due to infection with WPV-2 worldwide is presently zero (and has
been since the last isolate in October 1999), whereas there have been
442 cases of paralytic polio due to infection with a VDPV-2. Perhaps
the time has come to re-evaluate the use of a trivalent OPV, and
consider using a bivalent OPV with vaccine virus types 1 and 3 -- the
2 WPV types presently in circulation and responsible for all paralytic
polio cases due to WPV infections.

[2] Pakistan: vaccine refusal
Date: Thu 4 Aug 2011
Source: Dawn.com (Pakistan) [edited]
http://www.dawn.com/2011/08/04/anti-polio-drive-in-kp-over-16000-refusal-cases-recorded-in-july-2.html


Anti-polio drive in KP: Over 16 000 refusal cases recorded in July
[2011]
------------------------------------------------------------------
The health department's failure to educate the parents on the efficacy
of oral polio vaccine (OPV) has been resulting in large-scale refusals
against immunisation of children, officials say.

"In the last 3-day campaign in July [2011], 16 721 children could not
be immunised mainly because of the parents' misperceptions about the
efficacy of the OPV," the officials said.

They said that refusals against the OPV were so widespread that except
Kohistan and Chitral, the rest of 23 KP [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
previously known as the North-West Frontier Province] districts had
been regularly registering refusal cases.

Several measures taken by the government are yet to yield results
because there is no field campaign to prevail upon the parents that
vaccination is meant to safeguard their children against the crippling
ailment. For instance, the parents refuse vaccination of their
children on the argument that the OPV is a ploy designed to turn the
recipient children infertile and impotent.

The health department doesn't have any mechanism to clearly prove that
the OPV is safe and contains no agent that causes impotency. As a
result, in areas where literacy rate is very low the parents continue
to resist polio vaccination of their children.

Several donor organisations, spearheaded by the WHO and UNICEF, have
been financing the polio campaign from the past 15 years, but still
achieving the goal of polio eradication seems to be a difficult task.

Last year [2010], when the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally
Administered Tribal Area (FATA) together recorded 100 cases of the
total 142 cases in the country, the donor organisations expressed
concern over the surge in polio cases and threatened to stop funding
the campaign if the crippling disease was not eradicated this year
[2011]. On its part the government has been changing strategies to
cope with the situation, but instead of recording any improvement
Pakistan is inching towards being known as the polio endemic country.

Officials in the UN said that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had previously
been giving militancy and violence as the reasons for the poor
vaccination campaigns, but most of refusal cases were now emerging
from peaceful areas. They said that over Rs 500 million [USD 5.8
million] was being spent on each of the 9 campaigns every year to
provide the OPV to about 5 million children.

The UN agencies also argue that Pakistan has been the main source of
transportation of polioviruses to the countries long declared
polio-free and urging the government to apply political commitment to
wipe out the disease as early as possible.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has implemented its own polio
eradication strategy with the claim that the disease will be
eliminated by end of 2011, but the province has so far recorded 6
cases of the total 60 in the country and indications are that the
disease would continue to haunt the children.

The government has also been making efforts to involve the religious
figures and teachers in the campaign, but some officials claim such
steps fail to produce any tangible results.

However, Dr Jan Baz Afridi, the top polio officer in the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, argues that they have brought down refusal cases from 26
000 to 16 000 during the past 6 months and are well on the way to end
such cases by convincing the parents in due course of time. "The
refusal cases have not increased, but we have strengthened our
reporting system to record every child. Earlier, the system of
reporting was not so strong to cover the maximum children," he said.

[The apparent high number of refusals for vaccination with OPV in an
endemic country such as Pakistan is disturbing. While the newswire
mentions that there is an improvement, with a prior estimated 24 000
refusals now "down to" 16 000 refusals, one cannot help but remember
what happened when the northern states of Nigeria had large numbers of
refusals of vaccination for similar spurious rumors back in 2004, and
the subsequent impact on many other countries that had previously
interrupted transmission of wild poliovirus (see prior ProMED-mail
posts listed below). There were over 14 countries with importations
and local transmission of WPV related to viruses of Nigerian origin.
(If one looks at the weekly update presented in item [4] below, one
can see that during the period 1 Jan 2010 through 2 Aug 2011, there
were 20 non-endemic polio countries that had cases due to WPV
infections related to importations from endemic countries.

[3] Nigeria: vaccine refusal
Date: Tue 2 Aug 2011

Nigeria: hundreds of parents refuse polio vaccines
--------------------------------------------------
An independent monitor says hundreds of parents are defying threats of
jail time by refusing polio vaccines for their children in a high-risk
northern Nigerian state.

Muhammad Abdu Zango, Kano state coordinator of Journalists Against
Polio, said Tuesday [2 Aug 2011] that more than 200 parents refused
the vaccine in one district alone.

Vaccinator Amina Ahmed says dozens more refused in another district.

The 4-day drive targeted some 6 million children in a state that has
recorded 2 new polio cases this year [2011].

Authorities last week [week of 25 Jul 2011] said noncompliant parents
would be prosecuted. Parents have given various reasons to resist the
vaccine.

Polio is largely eradicated in most of the world, but health officers
say even a few vaccine holdouts can compromise an eradication
campaign.

[As mentioned above, in 2004 there was massive refusal to vaccinate
with OPV in the northern states of Nigeria. This persisted for several
years, during which time there were more than 14 countries that had
previously interrupted WPV circulation, which had imported WPV
associated paralytic cases due to viruses related to those circulating
in Nigeria. It is nice to see that the situation has changed in
Northern Nigeria, with a government stance of intolerance for vaccine
refusal.

their association with the WPV1 outbreak

Country weekly updates:
Afghanistan
- No cases were reported this week. The total number of cases for 2011
remains 11. The most recent case (wild poliovirus type 1 -- WPV1) had
onset of paralysis 28 Jun 2011 in Musa Qala district of Hilmand
province.
- Sub-national Immunization Days (SNIDs) took place from 10-12 Jul
2011. Bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) was used to vaccinate
children in high risk districts. The next supplementary immunization
activities (SIAs) will be National Immunization Days (NIDs) in
September [2011].

India
- India has not reported a single case in more than 6 months. The most
recent case had onset of paralysis on 13 Jan 2011 in West Bengal
(WPV1).
- SNIDs took place beginning 26 Jun 2011 in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,
Delhi, and parts of West Bengal and other high-risk areas. The next
SIAs will be SNIDs using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) in August
2011.
- India has also gone 8 months without detecting any wild poliovirus
from environmental sampling. The last positive environmental sample
was taken from Mumbai in November 2010.

Nigeria
- No new case was reported in the past week. The total number of cases
for 2011 remains 24. The most recent case (WPV3) had onset of
paralysis on 24 Jun 2011 in Sabon-Gari, Kaduna State. This is the 1st
wild poliovirus detected in Kaduna in 2011.
- A 6th round of supplementary immunization activities (SIA) took
place 28-31 Jul 2011 in 11 states using a mix of bivalent and
trivalent OPV. The quality of this round is currently being evaluated.
Any Ward with greater than 10 per cent missed children will redo the
activity to ensure that as many children are reached as possible.

Pakistan
- No new case was reported in the past week. The total number of cases
for 2011 remains 60. The most recent case (WPV1) had onset of
paralysis on 22 Jun 2011 in Quetta, Balochistan.

Kubango, Cunene, and 3 municipalities of Uige. The next SIAs will be
Child Health Days (CHDs) to be held on 9-22 Sep 2011. Trivalent OPV
will be distributed to children under 5 along with measles vaccine,
vitamin A and deworming tablets.

Chad
- 4 new cases were reported in the past week (all WPV1). The total
number of cases for 2011 is now 93. The most recent case (WPV1) had
onset of paralysis on 27 Jun 2011 in Doba, Logone Oriental.
- The "Staggered SIA" approach continues to be utilized in Chad in
order to maximize technical staff support in each area. The latest
staggered round commenced 29 Jul 2011 using bivalent oral polio
vaccine (bOPV).
- The next round is scheduled for September 2011, with exact dates to
be confirmed.

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
- No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases for 2011 remains 71. The most recent case had onset of paralysis
on 3 Jul 2011 in Kimvula, Bas-Congo.
- The 2nd of the 2 short interval additional dose (SIAD) campaigns
took place 27 Jul-1 Aug 2011 in 48 high-risk districts of Bandundu,
Bas-Congo, and Kinshasa. Monovalent OPV type 1 (mOPV1) was used. The
1st SIAD round was carried out in 13 high-risk districts of Bandundu
and Bas-Congo from 13-15 Jul 2011.
- SNIDs using mOPV1 are being planned for August 2011.

Horn of Africa
- No cases have been reported from this group of countries this year
[2011].
- Polio-funded staff continue to assist in the response to the
drought. The Horn of Africa coordination meeting taking place in
Nairobi this week [week of 3 Aug 2011] will not only discuss and plan
upcoming SIAs but will look at how polio infrastructure can be
utilized in the response to the drought.

West Africa
- One new case was reported in Burkina Faso. The most recent case had
onset of paralysis on 15 Jun 2011 in Djibo, Dori.
- 11 new cases were reported in Cote d'Ivoire the past week. The most
recent case had onset of paralysis on 26 Jun 2011 in Zoukougbe, Haut
Sassandra.
- One new case was reported in Mali. The most recent case had onset of
paralysis on 10 Jun 2011 in Bankass, Mopti.
- This brings the total number of cases for 2011 in the West Africa
region to 37 (all WPV3 -- 2 from Burkina Faso, 28 from Cote d'Ivoire,
one from Guinea, 5 from Mali, and one from Niger).
- A multi-country campaign started on 24 Jul 2011 in Burkina Faso,
Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and Mali. A combination of bOPV and
mOPV3 is being used to help combat the outbreak of WPV3.
- Cote d'Ivoire along with 6 neighbouring countries (NIDs in Sierra
Leone and SNIDs in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, and Mali) are
planning a further round in August 2011.

[Noteworthy is the observation that 207 of the 303 (68 per cent)
reported cases of WPV associated polio during the period 1 Jan through
2 Aug 2011, are outbreak associated cases in non-endemic countries. In
addition, of the 96 WPV associated cases reported in endemic countries
during the period 1 Jan through 2 Aug 2011, 60 (63 per cent) were in
Pakistan, 24 (25 per cent) were in Nigeria, 11 (11 per cent) were in
Afghanistan, and only 1 (1 per cent) was in India.
