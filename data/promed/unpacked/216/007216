German dairy cows -- cause for concern in Twente
------------------------------------------------
The German cattle disease which occurs in 2000 German cattle holdings
is a cause for great concern to dairy cattle owners in Twente and the
Achterhoek ["rear-corner," a region in the eastern part of the
Netherlands]. Has it crossed the border?

"It does not seem so; feed and pollution seem to be the causative
issues," said the Utrecht Professor Johanna Fink-Gremmels.

The German TV station ZDF lately showed a recent overview by the
University of Gottingen. Most cases are concentrated in the vicinity
of the Dutch border.

In eastern Netherlands, faeces samples have been collected from cows
suffering from a strange form of winter diarrhea. Is that chronic
botulism?

"No, the disease picture is different. Moreover, the animals have
recovered," said the Animal Health Service.

Yet even Dutch cows have become sick and the symptoms are not
described in any classical textbook.

Is it chronic botulism as allegedly the case is in 2000 German farms?
There is need for investigation.

[The reference to a German animal (cattle) health problem is probably
related to reports in German press, earlier this year, on suspected
cases of chronic botulism attributed to tainted waste from
"climate-friendly" biogas plants, which is then used as an
agricultural fertilizer in fields. This subject was initially raised
in a press release issued by the German sporting and dog magazine
'Wild und Hund' on 19 May 2011. The magazine demanded a public
discussion on the said practice.

The Dutch Animal Health Service in Deventer published on Mon 26 Sep
2011 a news bulletin addressing "Reports of cows with watery diarrhea,
fever, and declined production."

The syndrome was reported from more than 80 dairy farms where varying
percentage of the cows had watery diarrhea, fever to 41 C and a
substantial loss of production. Manure samples were collected and said
to be under investigation. The complaints came from virtually all
parts of Netherlands; for the full report (Dutch) see

Information on the epidemiological and laboratory investigations
performed in Germany and in the Netherlands and of the results
obtained so far, preferably from authoritative sources, will be
appreciated. Exclusion of potential public health hazards deserves to
be prioritised. - Mod.AS]
