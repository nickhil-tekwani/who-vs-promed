[The following comment has been received from Professor Tang in response to
the ProMED-mail post entitled "Avian influenza, human (52): treatment or
prophylaxis 20080611.1846". ProMED-mail welcomes this contribution, but as
debate is likely to divert attention from our principal function of
outbreak reporting, further discussion of this topic will be discouraged. -

Although the aborted-infection immunization approach may work, and is
preferable to mass prophylaxis, the main problem may be the implementation
of influenza rapid testing at pharmacists or other general practitioner
clinics, both of whom are untrained to perform such rapid tests. In
addition, they are usually already very busy and will be only more so
during any pandemic influenza event, so substantial resources will have to
be put into place to enable them to perform such rapid diagnostic testing
prior to the distribution of anti-influenza drugs, like oseltamivir.

In addition, most rapid tests for influenza require a minimum level of
training to perform well and may have quite a high rate of false negatives,
especially when the actual pandemic influenza strain will not have been
tested on existing kits (see CDC website for an up-to-date summary:
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/>).

There needs to be some sort of mechanism for these samples to be forwarded
on to the local diagnostic or reference virology laboratory for viral
culture and further strain characterization, since none of these rapid
tests can distinguish influenza subtypes (i.e. H3N2, H5N1 and H1N1), but
just between influenza types A and B.

Secondly, if such a policy becomes widely accepted and publicized, a large
number of people with influenza-like illness will be swamping such premises
that probably do not have sufficient waiting area capacity to accommodate
all these patients whilst they are (presumably) registering their personal
details, awaiting their turn to have their nasal swab, etc. taken, then
waiting for the rapid test to be performed, then waiting for their results
(up to 30 minutes), then waiting for their oseltamivir.

Thirdly, there are also serious infection control issues to consider. While
all of these people are waiting with their influenza-like illness, they
will be coughing, sneezing, talking, mouth-breathing amongst themselves,
and may well be cross-infecting each other as well as any other patients or
staff members nearby; some of them may have TB (or perhaps even MDR-TB)
rather than a respiratory viral infection. Ideally, they should be made to
wear masks while they are in the waiting areas, but compliance with this
may be difficult to monitor and enforce. Importantly, there needs to be
some mechanism for referring the seriously ill directly to the local
Accident and Emergency room.

Fourthly, will these individuals have to pay for these tests and any
oseltamivir prescription? If so, what are the pharmacists and general
practitioners going to say to those people with an influenza negative test?
"Sorry, you may have another respiratory viral infection, but it is not
influenza, so please pay for your negative test result, then maybe you can
take some paracetamol and go home?"

Clinical microbiologists/virologists are usually wary of introducing such
rapid/bedside/near-patient/point-of-care diagnostic tests in healthcare
settings (usually to be performed by infectious disease or pediatric teams)
because of the need to then confirm such results (either positive or
negative) by the standard laboratory tests (again, see:
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/>), since these results
will have a significant impact on subsequent clinical management (Madeley
2007). So the use of such rapid tests in community settings where the staff
are generally untrained with relatively non-specialized facilities needs to
be approached with caution.

The expenditure to put such community rapid testing facilities in place may
well outweigh the cost of the mass stockpiling and distribution of
antiviral drugs in preparation for any influenza pandemic. Of course, this
consideration should be secondary to the potentially worse alternative
scenario arising from the use of widespread prophylaxis that may result in
the widespread development of antiviral resistance, making such antivirals
useless.
