A total of 11 deaths due to hepatitis-D were reported so far in
Modasa taluka of Gujarat's Sabarkantha district in the last 5 days,
health officials here said. Officials said 21 patients are admitted
to various hospitals in the area so far, and 5 were rushed to the
civil hospital in Ahmedabad Friday [13 Feb 2009].

"We have asked for a central team from the National Institute of
Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the Director General of Health
Services (DGHS), and the team is arriving shortly," said Chief
District Health Officer (CDHO) H.F. Patel.

A 3-member team from the B.J. Medical College, Ahmedabad, led by
Nayan Qadri, has already arrived in Modasa Thursday [12 Feb 2009].
"At present, 5 doctors and 27 paramedics are in the area," Patel said.

The hepatitis-D virus (also called delta virus) is a small circular
RNA virus and affects humans only in the presence of hepatitis-B
infection. It is transmitted by blood and blood products. The risk
factors for infection are similar to those for hepatitis-B virus
infection. The hepatitis-D virus most often infects intravenous drug
users, Patel said. "We have published 25 000 pamphlets, and we are
circulating them as part of our awareness campaign," he said.

[In ProMED archive no. 20030712.1718, Mod.CP wrote the following
about Hepatitis D virus infections: Because hepatitis delta virus
(HDV) is dependent on hepatitis B virus (HBV) for replication,
HBV/HDV co-infection can be prevented with either pre- or
post-exposure prophylaxis for HBV. HDV infection can be acquired
either as a co-infection with HBV or as a superinfection of persons
with chronic HBV infection. Persons with HBV/HDV co-infection may
have more severe acute disease and a higher risk of fulminant
hepatitis (2-20 percent) compared with those infected with HBV alone;
however, chronic HBV infection appears to occur less frequently in
individuals with HBV/HDV co-infection. Chronic HBV carriers who
acquire HDV superinfection usually develop chronic HDV infection. In
long-term studies of chronic HBV carriers with HDV superinfection,
70-80 percent have developed evidence of chronic liver diseases with
cirrhosis compared with 15-30 percent of patients with chronic HBV
infection alone. Thus, prevention of HDV superinfection depends
primarily on education to reduce risk behaviors. In some Latin
American countries in the Amazon River Basin, periodic epidemics of
HDV infection have occurred among chronic HBV carriers in relatively
isolated regions. Disease related to HDV infection in these outbreaks
has been very severe, with rapid progression to fulminant hepatitis
and case-fatality rates of 10-20 percent. The cause of the atypical
course of HDV infection in these populations is unknown.

The modes of HDV transmission are similar to those for HBV, with
percutaneous exposures the most efficient. Sexual transmission of HDV
is less efficient than for HBV. Perinatal HDV transmission is rare.
The serologic course of HDV infection varies depending on whether the
virus is acquired as a co-infection with HBV or as a superinfection
of a person with chronic HBV infection. In most persons with HBV/HDV
co-infection, both IgM antibody to HDV (anti-HDV) and IgG anti-HDV
are detectable during the course of infection. However, in about 15
percent of patients, the only evidence of HDV infection may be the
detection of either IgM anti-HDV alone during the early acute period
of illness or IgG anti-HDV alone during convalescence. Anti-HDV
generally declines to sub-detectable levels after the infection
resolves, and there is no serologic marker that persists to indicate
that the patient was ever infected with HDV. Hepatitis Delta antigen
(HDAg) can be detected in serum in only about 25 percent of patients
with HBV-HDV co-infection. When HDAg is detectable, it generally
disappears as HBsAg disappears, and most patients do not develop
chronic infection. - Mod.CP]

[The basis on which the HDV diagnosis was made in this Indian
outbreak was not indicated in the above report. ProMED requests
information about any laboratory tests done in these cases and
further information about the outbreak as it becomes available.

The administrative headquarters of the Sabarkantha district is
Himmatnagar, 80 km (50 miles) from Ahmedabad. The District has a
population of over 2 million in its 7390 sq km (2853 sq mi) area.
