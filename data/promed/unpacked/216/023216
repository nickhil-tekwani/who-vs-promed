African horse sickness (AHS) in Ethiopia
----------------------------------------
Following the identification of AHSV-2 in Lagos, Nigeria in January
2007 and in Senegal in June 2007, AHSV-2 has been identified in
August 2008 in material from Ethiopia.

We'll be checking to see if there is a relationship between them.

[We are grateful to Dr Truuske Gerdes for the important information
above. Sequencing results are anticipated with interest.

AHS is endemic in Ethiopia. According to Ethiopia's 1st semiannual
report for 2008 to the OIE (covering the months of January-June), 41
AHS outbreaks were recorded during the said period, of which 40 were
new. These outbreaks involved 46 719 susceptible equidae, of which
348 were infected and 146 died. No animals were, reportedly,
destroyed. The reported numbers of outbreaks during previous years
were: 2005 - 65; 2006 - 75; 2007 - 108; no information on the
serotype(s) involved, throughout those years, was included.

Ethiopia reported that 550 000 doses of AHS vaccine were applied
during 2007, covering 8.55 percent of the population of 6 432 600
equidae. Information on the serotypes included in the vaccine was not provided.

Following the current identification of AHSV-2 in Ethiopia,
information on the affected population will be appreciated, including
clinical observations, morbidity and mortality statistics, locations,
the vaccination status of affected animals, and control measures
applied. In case AHS-2 is a new strain in Ethiopia (as the case was,
during 2007, in Nigeria and Senegal), an immediate notification to
the OIE is due.

Of the 9 AHSV serotypes, types 1 to 8 are typically found only in
restricted areas of sub-Saharan Africa while type 9 is more
widespread and has been responsible for virtually all epidemics
outside Africa, the only exception being the 1987-1990
Spanish-Portuguese outbreaks, which were due to AHSV-4. Before the
identification of AHSV-2 in West Africa in 2007, only AHSV serotypes
9 and 4 were known to circulate there, occasionally spreading into
countries surrounding the Mediterranean. There is considered to be
some cross relatedness between AHSV types 1 and 2; 3 and 7; 5 and 8;
and 6 and 9. - Mod.AS
