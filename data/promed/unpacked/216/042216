Pakistan: alert over 3 cases of suspected CCHF
----------------------------------------------
A woman died of suspected Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in a
hospital in Rawalpindi, Pakistan on Sun 11 Dec 2005, and another suspected
case was admitted to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) on
the same day.
CCHF belongs to the same family as the deadly Ebola virus found in Africa.
It causes massive bleeding through the nose, mouth, and ears and can lead
to organ failure. [This erroneous statement has appeared in previous
reports emanating from the subcontinent. CCHF virus and Ebola virus are
similar only in that they cause hemorrhagic fevers. They are
phylogenetically distinct viruses. CCHF virus is classified in the famliy
_Bunyaviridae_ and Ebola fever virus is a member of the family
_Filoviridae_. A considerable amount is known about the host range and
routes of transmission of CCHF, whereas the reservoir and route of
transmission of Ebola fever virus to humans remains an enigma. CCHF virus
is widely distributed, whereas Ebola virus with one exception is not known
to occur outside of central Africa. - Mod.CP]
The 35 year old woman was brought to the Rawalpindi General Hospital (RGH)
on Saturday [10 Dec 2005] evening after she developed high fever and
serious bleeding a few days after she gave birth to her 8th child in a
private clinic. "It was a mishandled delivery case," Dr Habib Ahmed Khan,
medical superintendent of the RGH, told the Pakistani daily, "Dawn," when
contacted.
"When her relatives brought her to the RGH, the patient had been bleeding
seriously. She was given blood, and a senior lady doctor handled her, but
she died on Sunday afternoon," he said.
Suspicion that she was the victim of the deadly CCHF virus arose because
her husband works at a cattle skin washing factory. CCHF virus is a
tickborne virus stemming from livestock, and is transmitted into open cuts
and sores. Initial symptoms include headaches, fever and vomiting.
[Infected cattle exhibit no signs of disease. Serious hemorrhagic disease
occurs only in humans, and transmission from person-to-person can occur,
especially in hospital settings. - Mod.CP]
Though he insisted that symptoms of CCHF were not detected in this woman's
case, Dr Habib said that her blood sample had been sent to the National
Institute of Health (NIH) for confirmation of the diagnosis. "All possible
infection control measures have been taken. The operation theatre where the
woman was operated [upon] was closed and fumigated," he added.
Meanwhile, a 27 year old man who is a butcher in Abottabad was admitted to
hospital with suspected CCHF. He was rushed to the Pakistan Institute of
Medical Sciences (PIMS) after he developed symptoms a day after his cousin,
also a butcher, died of high fever and excessive bleeding in an Abbottabad
hospital on Sat 10 Dec 2005.
The city authorities have banned the sale of sheep meat in Abbottabad since
the incident, sources told the Dawn newspaper. Sources at PIMS said the 27
year old man has been kept in isolation and that his blood sample would be
sent to the National Health Institute (NIH) for analysis in laboratories in
South Africa to determine whether he has CCHF.
Hospital sources said that no safety measures had been implemented for the
transportation of the 35 year old woman's body. The body was neither
cleaned with chlorine or wrapped in plastic sheets to ensure safe
transportation and burial.

Pakistan: mystery disease kills young girl
------------------------------------------
A young girl who was a student of the 10th class passed away due to a
mysterious disease at Zezdi village near Kushum Tehsil Mulkoh [in the
Northwest Frontier Province]. Some suspected it might possibly be bird flu.
Eyewitness disclosed to this correspondent that the young girl was
suffering from twitching (jerking) which later converted into bleeding from
her nose and mouth, and she expired a short while later. [The tentative
diagnosis of avian influenza could not be substantiated].

[This "mystery" death of the child in the Northwest Frontier Province might
be another case of CCHF. Abbottabod, the town referred to in the report
from Rawalpindi, is also located in the Northwest Frontier Province.
Rawalpindi, where the 35 year old woman in the 1st report was treated, is
located in northern Punjab, not far from the Northwest Frontier Province
border. - Mod.CP]
