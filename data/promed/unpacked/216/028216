Ebola virus disease, West Africa -- update
------------------------------------------
Between 24-27 Jul 2014, a total of 122 new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD; laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) as well as 57 deaths were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.

[These figures and much of the text remain the same as those in previous WHO updates -- see ProMED-mail archive 20140730.2646645 and earlier. - Mod.JW]

The sample from [the Nigerian] case is yet to be sent to the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, due to refusal by courier companies to transport this sample. Though only one probable case has been detected so far in Nigeria, ebolavirus infection in this country represents a significant development in the course of this outbreak.

[In view of the importance of confirmation by a WHO reference lab, one would have thought that a solution would have been organized by now -- perhaps substitution of the regular courier by somebody not frightened of a triple-bagged, sanitized package? - Mod.JW]

As of 27 Jul 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the 4 countries stands at 1323 including 729 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows:
- Guinea, 460 cases (336 confirmed, 109 probable, and 15 suspected) including 339 deaths;
- Liberia, 329 cases (100 confirmed, 128 probable, and 101 suspected) including 156 deaths;
- Nigeria, 1 case (1 probable who died);
- Sierra Leone, 533 cases (473 confirmed, 38 probable, and 22 suspected) including 233 deaths.

[There is also a table showing:]
Confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, as of 27 Jul 2014 [but not Nigeria]

The total number of cases is subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, and enhanced surveillance. Data reported in the Disease Outbreak News are based on best available information reported by Ministries of Health.

[2] Vaccine trial
Date: Sat 2 Aug 2014
Source: Bangkok Post, AFP report [edited]
http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/world/423707/ebola-outbreak-speeds-up-efforts-to-find-a-vaccine


Next month [September 2014], the US government's National Institutes of Health plan to start an early, phase I study in humans of an ebolavirus vaccine candidate that has shown promise in tests on monkeys. "We are starting to discuss some deals with pharmaceutical companies to help scale it up on an emergency basis," said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [NIAID]. "It might be available in 2015 for health workers who are putting themselves at extreme risk."

Some of these [candidate] vaccines have already shown 80-90 percent effectiveness in tests on monkeys, and none have had life-threatening side effects, said Cambridge University lecturer Peter Walsh. But the process has been complicated by regulators who say trying an unproven vaccine on humans would be unethical. "This argument -- that it is unethical to use non-licensed vaccines -- is just crazy," Walsh told AFP, adding that the vaccine NIAID is working on has already been a decade in the making. "The ethical thing to do is to treat them, to vaccinate them (in West Africa). It is a no-brainer. It is scandalous that we are not doing that."

Herve Raoul, a leading expert on pathogens and research director at the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM), said "A vaccine is only effective after a certain period, generally at least 3 weeks prior to exposure. The ideal thing today would be to develop an antiviral drug that would help sick people get through the most acute phase of the illness." However, there is currently no such medication in the pipeline to treat Ebola.

[In Phase 1 trials, researchers test an experimental drug or treatment in a small group of people (20-80) for the 1st time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects.

In Phase 2 trials, the experimental treatment is given to a larger group of people (100-300) to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety.

In Phase 3 trials, the treatment is given to large groups of people (1000-3000) to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow it to be used safely.

After that, these vaccinated people will have to be followed up with for months to test if they will need booster doses to maintain or improve immunity. And if some people vaccinated during an epidemic were already unknowingly infected and died soon afterwards -- or the vaccine cold chain had not been properly maintained in the field, allowing the vaccine to deteriorate -- the vaccine would be discredited, or worse, accused of causing the disease. So much could go wrong. - Mod.JW]

[3] Screening effectiveness

During the SARS outbreak in 2003, the WHO recommended screening passengers with questionnaires and thermal scanners, but few sick travelers were detected. Hong Kong screened 36 million passengers and detected 2 cases, and Australia screened 1.8 million people arriving, and 4 cases were detected by border screening, according to a 2005 study by K. Glass and N.G. Becker. Canada screened 4 million passengers and detected no cases, and Singapore screened 400 000 people entering the country and detected no cases, according to the study.

"The challenge for travel screening is that there is an 'incubation' period between someone being infected until they start showing symptoms," said Kathryn Glass, a fellow at Australian National University who co-authored the SARS report. "If infected people travel during that time, they are hard to spot based on symptoms. For diseases like influenza and SARS, we have the additional problem that early symptoms can be difficult to distinguish from many other conditions."

US doctor walks into Atlanta hospital
-------------------------------------
2 Aug 2014: An American doctor infected with the ebolavirus in Africa was able to walk from an ambulance into an Atlanta hospital tonight after he arrived in the USA on a specially-equipped plane. It marks the 1st time anyone infected with Ebola virus disease, considered one of the world's deadliest diseases, is believed to have been brought into the country for treatment.

WHO: health worker fatalities
-----------------------------
1 Aug 2014: Director General Margaret Chan told a summit, including the leaders of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, that the virus was moving faster than the world's efforts to control it thus far. A striking fact is buried in her remarks:

"In addition, the outbreak is affecting a large number of doctors, nurses, and other health care workers, one of the most essential resources for containing an outbreak. To date, more than 60 health care workers have lost their lives in helping others. Some international staff are infected. These tragic infections and deaths significantly erode response capacity."

That's more than 60 dead health workers out of more than [800] dead so far -- [almost] one in 10, a jarring figure. Health workers are of course orders of magnitude more likely to contract the virus, given their close proximity to the victims. The virus, Dr. Chan carefully notes, is not transmitted by air but by contact with blood, urine, saliva, and other bodily fluids of the infected -- even after the victim has died. One would assume that many of the health workers who have succumbed did not have proper training for dealing with Ebola, and were operating under the constraints of West Africa's severely inadequate health infrastructure.

ICAO and World Health Organization Collaboration on Ebola Outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------------
30 Jul 2014: The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a UN specialized agency, is continuing to collaborate with representatives of the UN World Health Organization (WHO) over the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Despite the increasing number of cases, the WHO recently reiterated its advice that it does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone, based on current information. The WHO, ICAO and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) considered passenger screening revisions to the WHO document on travel and transport in light of recent events. These are still being reviewed by the WHO, which was also intending to seek inputs from the World Tourism Organization and Airports Council International (ACI).

Travel advisories, USA
----------------------
1 Aug 2014: The State Department on Thursday [1 Aug 2014] issued a travel advisory warning U.S. citizens to avoid traveling to the 3 West African nations.

President Obama addressed Ebola in a press conference Friday [1 Aug 2014]. "I know it's on people's minds," he said, after highlighting the strategic and economic issues he hoped to tackle at the [forthcoming] summit [of African leaders to be held 4-6 Aug in Washington DC, USA].
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/01/ebola-worries-at-forefront-as-africa-summit-starts/13487699/

[But ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka couldn't find such an advisory on the site of US DOS, and neither could I. http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html. CDC has, however, elevated its Travel Warnings to Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel (the top level) for all 3 countries (not including Nigeria). - Mod.JW]

Missionaries evacuated
----------------------
1 Aug 2014: The LDS Church [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, aka Mormon Church] is transferring all of its 274 missionaries out of Sierra Leone and Liberia, where the deadliest-known Ebola virus disease outbreak in history has killed hundreds of people, including 2 Mormons. The church announced the decision Friday [1 Aug 2014]. "We are aware of 2 members who have died from the ebolavirus," church spokeswoman Jessica Moody said, apparently one in Sierra Leone and one in Liberia.
