A 2nd Union County, New Jersey horse has tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), the New Jersey Department of Agriculture announced on 20 Mar 2018.

That horse resides on the same property quarantined last week after a horse developed equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form EHV-1).

The 2nd horse developed an elevated temperature and exhibited respiratory signs of disease, but the attending veterinarian did not note any neurologic signs. That horse was placed in the farm's isolation barn, and the entire property remains quarantined.

Personnel continue to take temperatures twice daily on all horses on the property. No horses have moved on or off the property in approximately a month, therefore, officials consider exposure to outside horses unlikely.

This 2nd EHV-1-positive horse has reset the quarantine clock and, at this point, will delay the release date another 3 days. These are the 1st reported EHV-1 cases in New Jersey in 2018.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM. In many horses, the only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Officials note that EHM is a reportable disease in New Jersey. If an owner has a horse exhibiting neurologic signs or suspects EHV-1, he or she is directed to call their veterinarian immediately.

A barn and a farm have been released from EHV-1 quarantine, while one farm's school horse barn is still being watched.

On 27 Feb 2018, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) placed the Hazelwild Farm in Fredericksburg under quarantine for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM).

Utilizing separate biosecurity protocols, the farm immediately isolated a barn housing boarding horses from another barn that houses school horses. Since the quarantine began, 4 horses in the school barn have developed fevers and tested positive for equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1), but no horses developed neurologic signs.

None of the boarding horses have tested positive for EHV-1.

On 20 Mar 2018, VDACS released the boarder barn from quarantine.

The barn housing school horses will remain under quarantine for 21 days after the last clinical case.

A 2nd, unrelated farm in Powhatan was also placed under quarantine for EHM on 27 Feb 2018. The remaining horses at that farm showed no further signs of illness, and that farm was released from quarantine on 21 Mar 2018.

["Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) and equine herpesvirus 4 (EHV-4) comprise 2 antigenically distinct groups of viruses previously referred to as subtypes 1 and 2 of EHV-1. Both viruses are ubiquitous in horse populations worldwide and produce an acute febrile respiratory disease upon primary infection, characterized by rhinopharyngitis and tracheobronchitis. Outbreaks of respiratory disease occur annually among foals in areas with concentrated horse populations. Most of these outbreaks in weanlings are caused by strains of EHV-4. The age, seasonal, and geographic distributions vary and are determined by immune status and horse population. In individual horses, the outcome of exposure is determined by viral strain, immune status, pregnancy status, and possibly age. Infection of pregnant mares with EHV-4 rarely results in abortion.

"Mares may abort several weeks to months after clinical or subclinical infection with EHV-1. The neurologic form of EHV-1 has demonstrated increasing morbidity and mortality in the documented outbreaks since 2000 and appears to be evolving in virulence and behavior. Therefore, the USDA has designated neuropathic EHV-1 as a potentially emerging disease. The natural reservoir of both EHV-1 and EHV-4 is the horse. Latent infections and carrier states are seen with both virus types. Transmission occurs by direct or indirect contact with infectious nasal secretions, aborted fetuses, placentas, or placental fluids.

"Horses with EHV-1-associated neurologic disease may have no gross lesions or only minimal evidence of hemorrhage in the meninges, brain, and spinal cord parenchyma. Histologically, lesions are discrete and comprise vasculitis with endothelial cell damage and perivascular cuffing, thrombus formation and hemorrhage, and in advanced cases, areas of malacia. Lesions may occur at any level of the brain or spinal cord.

"If horses with neuropathic EHV-1 remain ambulatory or are recumbent for only 2-3 days, the prognosis is usually favorable. Valacyclovir (30 mg/kg, PO, bid) has shown promise in the treatment of affected horses and in prophylaxis during EHV-1 outbreaks. Intensive nursing care is necessary to avoid pulmonary congestion, pneumonia, ruptured bladder, or bowel atony. Recovery may be complete, but a small percentage of cases have neurologic sequelae."

The neurological form of this disease may have a positive outcome but often does not.
