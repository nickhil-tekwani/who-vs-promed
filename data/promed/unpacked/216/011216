Three raccoons found in Franklin County tested positive for canine distemper, according to results from the past week.

Kevin Kelly, a spokesman for the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife, told The State Journal on Mon 30 Dec 2019 that 2 of the raccoons were found in Downtown Frankfort, and the 3rd was found dead behind the Salato Wildlife Education Center. The samples were submitted before Christmas for testing, and the department received confirmation on Fri 27 Dec 2019 Kelly said.

"It's unknown if any of these cases is related to the case confirmed in October [2019]," Kelly said, referring to a case of a wild raccoon on found on Frankfort's east side earlier this year [2019].

The department offered the following information about canine distemper:

What is canine distemper?
It is a virus often occurring in raccoons, gray foxes, coyotes and occasionally skunks. Infected animals usually display signs including respiratory distress, coughing, sneezing, watery discharge from the eyes and nose, crusty footpads and diarrhea. They may also convulse, tremor, stagger, have chewing fits, become thin and lose fear of people. The signs of distemper are similar to rabies, so if a person comes in contact with, is bitten or scratched by a wild animal, they should call their health care provider or local health department to report a possible exposure.

The Department of Fish and Wildlife advises against attempting to capture or handle sick wildlife. Canine distemper is primarily transmitted by contact with bodily fluids and feces from infected animals, but transmission via environmental contamination is also possible.

Locals who see or encounter a raccoon appearing to be sick should contact a nuisance wildlife control operator. The department's ability to respond to reports of sick animals is determined by staff availability, so nuisance wildlife control operators are permitted by the department to provide professional wildlife control assistance for a fee. To look up a nuisance wildlife control operator, visit http://app.fw.ky.gov/nuisancecontrol. There are 11 serving Franklin County.

Canine distemper cannot be transmitted to people, but raccoon feces can contain parasites which can infect humans, especially small children, causing serious illness and organ damage. When cleaning up raccoon feces, take care to avoid contact with skins and mucous membranes.

Unvaccinated dogs are susceptible to canine distemper, and pet owners should keep their pets' vaccinations current. Those who feed animals outdoors should remove any leftover food as it could attract infected animals that are not completely debilitated by the virus and increase the risk of transmission to uninfected animals. The department discourages feeding raccoons and feral cats, as concentrating these animals in small areas makes disease transmission more likely. Canine distemper is typically fatal to infected animals.

[Canine distemper in raccoons can easily be mistaken for rabies, but the reverse is also true. Some people say a distemper raccoon is more sluggish and unlikely to attack. However, one should remember rabies has 2 forms: the furious form and the dumb form. The dumb form of rabies often presents with a withdrawn, fearful, shy animal, which is also the description of raccoons with distemper. A lab test is required to tell the difference in these diseases in raccoons. Do not try to catch a wild animal showing some signs of an illness. Call the appropriate animal control official. - Mod.TG
