[1] UK: testing regime
Date: Tue 12 Feb 2013

All horses slaughtered in Britain for human consumption must now undergo testing for the common anti-inflammatory drug, phenylbutazone.

Phenylbutazone, or bute, is banned from entering the human food chain because it can cause rare but serious adverse effects in humans, such as blood discrasia.

A zero limit for bute has been set for slaughter horses because scientists do not know the precise mechanism by which the drug can trigger these problems in humans.

Without that knowledge, scientists cannot be sure whether the tiniest exposure through eating tainted meat can trigger the disease, or whether longer or more significant exposure is required. However, most scientists agree that the risk is low.

Britain's Food Standards Agency [FSA] today [12 Feb 2013] announced a new system for horses slaughtered in Britain. Each horse carcass will require a negative phenylbutazone test before it is allowed to enter the food chain.

The agency has developed a testing regime, which enables results to come through about 48 hours after the test is carried out.

Each carcass will be kept in storage by individual food businesses, pending the result. If the test result is negative, the horse will be released into the food chain. However, if the horse tests positive for bute it will be disposed of as animal by-product under the authority of the agency.

The agency has been testing for bute in all horses slaughtered in Britain that are meant for human consumption since 30 Jan 2013. Horses that have been treated with bute are not allowed to enter the food chain.

In 2012, samples taken by the agency identified 9 cases where horses tested positive for bute. None of the meat was placed for sale on the UK market. Where the meat had been exported to other countries, the relevant food safety authorities were informed.

Currently in Britain, any horse being sold for its meat and destined for the food chain must be slaughtered in 1 of 5 slaughterhouses specifically approved by the agency. About 9000 horses were slaughtered for this purpose in 2012, with the bulk of the meat destined for markets in Europe.

[2] _Trichinella_ in horsemeat

Re: Horsemeat - Europe: control, food safety
--------------------------------------------
Questions that probably have to be addressed are:
What evidence is there that this horsemeat found in these ready meals is derived from horses which originated in trichinella free countries?

If not;
What evidence is there that there were abattoir controls and traceability to detect and remove any horsemeat contaminated with _Trichinella_?

If not;
What evidence is there that the processes or storage of the meat products were such (temp and time) that one can be assured no viable trichinella cysts are present?

I suspect the only saving grace may be the cooking of the 'ready meal' and the cooking by the consumer not 100 percent reliable but probably sufficient.

I am so glad that although I have eaten some of these meals recently I gave them a good 'go' with the microwave and left it for ages until my tongue could just about touch it.

[Dr Brown's observations are in place and acknowledged.

OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code addresses _Trichinella_ in equine meat in its article 8.13.5, as follows:
"Recommendations for the importation of fresh meat of equines (domestic and wild):
Veterinary authorities of importing countries may require the presentation of an international veterinary certificate attesting that the entire consignment of meat*:
1. comes from equines slaughtered and/or inspected in an approved abattoir;
and
2. were subjected to a testing procedure for trichinellosis with negative results; or
3. has been processed to ensure the destruction of all the larvae of the parasite."
* In the Code's glossary, 'Meat' is defined as 'all edible parts of an animal'; 'animal' is 'a mammal, bird, or bee'.

OIE's 'Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals 2012' includes chapter 2.01.16 with updated guidelines for the testing of pigs and horses for _Trichinella_ (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.16_TRICHINELLOSIS.pdf).

Ante- and postmortem veterinary inspection in slaughterhouses during slaughter of horses and testing at source are in state to significantly reduce public health hazards, even if the further trade routes of this commodity seem to be in need of enhanced control. It will be helpful to obtain information on the horsemeat testing regime for chemical residues and trichinella and on the obtained results from the main European exporting countries, such as Italy, Poland, Romania, and Spain. - Mod.AS]
