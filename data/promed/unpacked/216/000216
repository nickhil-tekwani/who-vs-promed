A shocking news report by Sinar Harian revealed that at least 13 Orang Asli in Gua Musang, Kelantan [Malaysia] have succumbed to an "unknown illness" related to unclean water, and that around 50 more of them are affected with it. [Orang Asli are indigenous people and the oldest inhabitants of Peninsular Malaysia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orang_Asli). - Mod.ML]

The small community of Kampung Kuala Koh with less than 300 Bateq people live in fear as they helplessly witness their loved ones die, one after the other. The ones that remain are sadly, merely "waiting for their time to die." [The Bateq are part of the Orang Asli indigenous people (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batek_people). - Mod.ML].

Why is this happening? According to Sinar Harian, the reason for their affliction is due to the contamination of a pond they depend on as a water source. A community representative says: "Since the beginning of Ramadhan [5 May 2019], villagers started getting sick. We suspected that it was because our water source had become contaminated."

It appears that only a few of them were affected at the start of Ramadhan, now the numbers have increased dramatically. They went on to discuss how afraid they were for their lives and the reason behind the contamination.

"This village has 223 inhabitants and 57 household heads. Even then, more than half of us are fighting for our lives. Our water was polluted by the waste dumped from a nearby iron ore mining plant that began operating 4 years ago."

According to Kosmo, the cause of the affliction is also suspected to be tuberculosis, a severe and potentially fatal bacterial lung infection.

The latest reported death involved a 22-year-old woman who succumbed to the condition on the night of ['7 Jun 2019]. Currently, 30 villagers have been taken to community health clinics, 14 were taken to Hospital Gua Musang (HGM), and 3 who are in critical condition were taken to Hospital Kuala Krai (HKK).

Not the 1st incident: in another recent case at the same village, large numbers of people experienced a severe fungal skin infection. Over 120 individuals from 30 families had symptoms of "scaly, pus-filled, and scabbed" skin.

It was reported by Harian Metro on [31 Mar 2019] that they were undergoing urgent medical care to prevent it from spreading to everyone in the village.

However, this was difficult as some of the Orang Asli would flee into the jungle whenever medical personnel arrived at the village.

The rights of the Orang Asli community in Malaysia and their access to land, development or even basic necessities like clean water have been subject to a long heated debate. The health of the Malaysian indigenous population is in a critical state as the national health care system is not adequately sensitive or responsive to the needs of the Orang Asli, which further alienates them from seeking treatment in the 1st place.

[Orang Asli constitute only 0.5% (about 150 00 people) of the total population of Malaysia; the majority of Orang Asli live in rural areas in poverty, with a high infant mortality rate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orang_Asli). Gua Musang is a town, district and parliamentary constituency in southern Kelantan, Malaysia. Kelantan, located in the northeastern corner of the peninsula is a state of Malaysia on the border with Thailand to the north (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelantan). A map showing the location of Gua Musang can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/L9ACrtHSASaimCpQA.

An outbreak of a deadly disease has afflicted a community of 223 indigenous people that is thought to be caused by a pond they depend on as a water source contaminated by wastewater from an iron mining operation. Although symptoms are not specified in the news report above, other than saying that some individuals developed purulent skin lesions, the cause of the outbreak is also suspected to be tuberculosis. However, tuberculosis is transmitted through the air, not by contaminated water, from person-to-person by inhalation of airborne particles 1 to 5 microns in diameter, called droplet nuclei, generated when persons who have pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis cough, sneeze, or sing. Tuberculosis may be a problem in this community, but it is unrelated to the contaminated pond. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML

If the water source is contaminated by waste from an iron ore plant this is indeed concerning. Waste from mines often includes unusable ore (because it is too low in the desired component), or wastewater used to flush out some mine substances.

Concentrations of toxic heavy metals such as manganese, zinc, iron, chromium, molybdenum, nickel, and cobalt have been found in mine water, as well as in iron tailings. It has also been reported that high concentrations of heavy metals (those listed above) are also found in the soils of surrounding localities. The soil concentration of metal ions (listed previously) at such sites varies but is generally recognized as high, ranging from 0.39-204 grams of metal per liter of water. [reference 38 in the source URL below. - Mod.TG]. The high levels of these toxic metal ions produce an adverse effect on growth and development of plants, animals and humans. Therefore, it is essential that eco-friendly techniques are developed to reduce potentially damaging exposures to these metals.

"Acid mine drainage" (AMD) refers to the particular process whereby low pH mine water is formed from the oxidation of sulfide minerals. In fact, the acid stream draining such ores and rock can contain high levels of metals and metalloids that exceed water quality standards and result in a toxic-effect to the aquatic life [or human life. - Mod.TG] [reference 51 in the IJSRM article cited below. - Mod.TG]

For iron recovered from sulfide-bearing ores, acid generation due to the oxidation of sulfides (such as, pyrite and pyrrhotite) in the ore body, host rock, and waste material may be of concern. Trace elements and minerals often associated with iron deposits include aluminum, antimony, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, manganese, nickel, selenium, silver, sulfur, titanium, and zinc [reference 119 in the IJSRM article cited below. - Mod.TG]

While we do not know the quality of the iron, or the type of mining system used in this region, it is likely there are a number of the contaminants mentioned above. The article does not tell us too much about the clinical symptoms these individuals are experiencing. However, since concentrations of some of the contaminants can reach high levels, these individuals may have kidney and/or liver damage. Bathing in water from the contaminated source could produce some skin lesions and perhaps some eye issues if this water were to regularly get into the eyes.

In washing the desired ore, there could be some chemicals used, which may also be in the water source. There is little information in the article except that there have been fatalities and some skin related issues. Anything in this mine wastewater could cause these signs, illnesses, or deaths. Information from knowledgeable sources in the area would be appreciated. - Mod.TG]
