FMD outbreak in Baganuur
------------------------
Strict quarantine regime was partly enforced in Baganuur, a satellite
district town located some 130 km [81 mi] away from Ulaanbaatar,
after laboratory test confirmed foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] outbreak.

The highly contagious acute viral disease killed a number of cattle
in a local herder family's herd, according to local veterinary and
emergency authorities who declared the regime on 17 Sep 2010.
Infected animals have been destroyed, and disinfection and
vaccination measures are taking place in the outbreak area. More than
1000 domestic animals and 5 herder families are believed to be in the
quarantine zone, under strict surveillance.

Vehicle checkpoint sites on the main road that connect the capital
city and eastern provinces have been re-enforced with disinfectant
officers closely screening and checking luggage trunks of all
vehicles to avoid the disease brought to Ulaanbaatar. All vehicles
are being disinfected at the sites.

As of Monday [20 Sep 2010], more than 4000 domestic animals have been
infected with the disease, 2000 of them have been destroyed since its
initial outbreak in 2 eastern provinces of Sukhbaatar and Dornod.

and the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/r/08nG>.

Since 21 Apr 2010, 5 FMD serotype O outbreaks in Eastern Mongolian
provinces have been reported to the OIE, involving cattle, sheep, and
goats. A positive PCR test was, reportedly, also found in a camel on
3 Sep 2010, but no further information on this case was available.
The last reported outbreak dates back to 2 Sep 2010. The current
outbreak presents a westwards spread.

The causative agent in Mongolia has been found to be FMDV serotype O,
SEA (Southeast Asia) topotype, Mya-98 lineage. A similar virus had
been confirmed in Hong Kong SAR, Republic of Korea, Japan, Mainland
China, and Russia (Zabaykalye). According to the WRLFMD (World
Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease), Pirbright, the
Mongolian virus appeared to be a different introduction to outbreaks
in PR China, Hong Kong SAR, Republic of Korea, and Japan, as it was
"most closely related to viruses from Thailand and Malaysia from
2009." A laboratory confirmation and further investigations into the
epidemiology of the FMD-O virus (SEA topotype, Mya-98 lineage)
affecting various species in eastern Asia, are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
