[1] Ukraine: vaccination of evacuated pets

We've collected a list of resources for families fleeing Ukraine with their pets and, as of 4 Mar 2022, have verified the details below. Please share this information with anyone who may be trying to evacuate with their pets. Several countries have plans to accept pets at border crossings. While pets must normally be vaccinated and microchipped to cross an international border, the countries below have agreed to an exception during this crisis. In most cases below, if a pet is not vaccinated or microchipped, the receiving country will vaccinate and microchip the pet upon entry.

We are extraordinarily proud of the countries who have made it possible for families to evacuate with their pets. Lithuania's director of State Food and Veterinary Service, Mantas Staskevicius, said, "We cannot be unconcerned about the people running from this horrible situation. Many Ukrainians will be traveling with their beloved pets, so we will help to find them the safest shelter."

In a tragic incident, 2 women have died of rabies after being bitten by a cat in Vemulamada in the Movva mandal of Krishna district [Andhra Pradesh State]. Going into the details, retirement RTC conductor SBR's wife [K] (64) from Vemulamada SC colony and [N] (43), wife of RMP doctor BB from the same colony, were bitten by a cat 2 months ago. At the time, both women had undergone TT [tetanus toxoid] injection and were on medication.

They were doing their job as usual after relief but 4 days ago, [K] and [N] went to a corporate hospital for treatment due to a change in their health. However, it did not improve. [K] died at 10 am on Saturday [5 Mar 2022] while undergoing treatment at the Mangalagiri NRI Hospital in Guntur district. [N] underwent treatment at PHC on Friday [4 Mar 2022] and was admitted to a corporate hospital in Vijayawada as per the instructions of the doctors there. She also died Saturday morning [5 Mar 2022] while receiving treatment.

Medical officer Dr Shonthi Sivarama Krishna Rao said 2 of the dead women were infected with rabies. He said the body was poisoned due to untimely medical services. The villagers said that the cat that bit the women was bitten by a dog and the dog also died a few days later.

[This case deserves further investigation. The rather short course and the full simultaneousness of the clinical stage of the reported fatal disease, in both patients, is noteworthy. More details of their initial anamnesis, the considerations behind the decision to administer only a tetanus toxoid (TT) injection, the refraining from rabies post-exposure treatment, as well as the medication both were receiving after the initial treatment will be helpful.

Another news report (https://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay?newsID=933925), mentions that "according to villagers, the cat was infected by rabies as it was bitten by a rabid dog earlier. The cat also died subsequently." Additional information (domestic or stray? contacts?) deserves to be sought. - Mod.AS

[3] Israel (Northern): cow, human exposure

The Israel Ministry of Health reported on a cow infected with rabies found in Tuba-Zangaria (in the pasture between Tuba and Moshav Elifelet), in the Upper Galilee last week [Northern/Hazafon District].

Two people are known to have been exposed to the cow and are receiving rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

Health officials ask anyone who has been in contact with, or whose animals came in contact with, the infected animal or a stray animal in the area of the incident on the dates of 14 Feb to 28 Feb [2022] to contact the Safed Health Bureau urgently, phone 04-6994257, 04-6994200, or contact the health bureau nearest to the place of residence to weigh the need for preventive care.

The Ministry of Health again reminds those who have been bitten or scratched by an animal to immediately wash the area with running water and soap, disinfect with disinfectants, and approach the Health Bureau to check if preventive treatment against rabies is needed.

This is the 8th lab-confirmed rabies case in northern Israel since 1 Jan 2022; the others were 5 jackals and 2 dogs in 7 different locations.

In the meantime, Israel's parliament (the Knesset) is debating a bill in which unowned, stray-feral dogs will be collected but, in difference with the prevailing legislation, be released after being vaccinated, or sterilized/neutered. The feral dog population is estimated at 30 000; Israel's owned, certified dog population (2020 data) exceeds 500 000 pets, of which about 460 000 are rabies vaccinated. Several professional bodies, including Israel's One Health, Nature Protection, and Municipality veterinarians have expressed their reservations. The discussions are being continued.
