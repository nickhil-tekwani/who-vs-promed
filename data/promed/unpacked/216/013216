Scientists from several southern California public health agencies, vector
control districts and the University of Texas Medical Branch have been
involved in a cooperative research project on arenavirus surveillance since
1998. The presence of White Water Arroyo Virus in our wood rat populations
is nothing new. It is widespread throughout several counties, especially
Orange and Riverside and antibody-positive rodents have been found dating
back to 1991. To date, several thousand rodents have been tested from this
region and temporal maintenance of the virus has been noted from individual
foci. In addition, multiple arenaviruses have been found in multiple rodent
species, including _Neotoma_, _Peromyscus_ and _Reithrodontomys_. Some have
even been coinfected with hantaviruses. If anyone cares to check, The
Society for Vector Ecology Newsletter (March 1999 issue) summarizes some of
our preliminary findings (web site: ). A detailed manuscript
regarding these studies has been accepted for publication by the American
Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.
Until any human cases of arenavirus infection are confirmed, most people
will remain apathetic, especially "The Media." Surveillance programs
determine the presence and prevalence the disease. The body count
reinforces supplements those findings.
If you desire further information, feel free to contact me or Dr. James P.
Webb at the Orange County Vector Control District.

[We have now heard from Los Angeles County (giving me "what for" for
posting a rumor), from San Bernadino County (personal message, not posted)
and now from Orange County. The county in which the supposed human
infection(s?) with an arenavirus occurred is Riverside County, I think. In
any event, we have posted lots of words but no one has denied or confirmed
anything. Question: Why is it so difficult for some people to say, "This is
untrue"? And I did try to contact the Orange County authorities but they
have not yet replied. - Mod. CHC
