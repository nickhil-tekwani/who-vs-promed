[We have indicated time and again the huge hazard that spread of African swine fever poses. In fact, in 2009, when we dealt with Russia (20091027.3720) citing the FAO: "The danger is that ASF [African swine fever] -- which cannot be transmitted to humans -- could spread to other regions including the European Union countries, Eastern Europe, the Black Sea basin countries and -- in the worst-case scenario -- central Asia and even China, which has the largest pig population in the world." Unfortunately, this all has materialized.

In the ProMED-mail post "African swine fever - Europe (20): update, international impact archive number: 20170821.5263661," we included the following useful reference: "Preparing for the worst: African swine fever in China" by Linda K. Dixon, published in the Veterinary Record [Vet Rec 2017;181:115-116, doi: 10.1136/vr.j3525]. http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/vetrec/181/5/115.full.pdf. - Mod.AS

According to the Reuters' article published in November 2017, titled "China's pig farmers go north, upending world's top meat, grain market" by Dominique Patton:

"China's largest pig farming companies and new entrants are racing to build vast, modern hog farms in the north-eastern cornbelt, expanding the world's biggest pork market and upending traditional trade flows in meat and grain.

"At least 8 listed companies have announced or confirmed plans to produce around 17 million pigs annually in the north-east in coming years.

"Many more companies, including the country's biggest pig farmer, Guangdong Wen's Foodstuff Group Co Ltd, are building farms in the area, suppliers and sources say, adding to China's annual USD 1 trillion pork market.

"Some researchers expect output in the northeast to hit nearly 120 million pigs a year, almost double the 69 million head produced in the area by Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning and Inner Mongolia provinces last year."

See the complete article at https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-farming-pigs/chinas-pig-farmers-go-north-upending-worlds-top-meat-grain-market-idUSKBN1DM12P.

The increasing concentration of large pig production facilities and the resulting movement of pork products out of these swine-dense areas has the potential of widely spreading the disease if not contained.

"Northeast China or Dongbei is a geographical region of China. It also historically corresponds with the term Inner Manchuria in the English language. It consists specifically of the 3 provinces of Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang, collectively referred as the Three Northeastern Provinces, but broadly also encompasses the eastern part of Inner Mongolia. The region is separated from far eastern Russia to the north largely by the Amur, Argun and Ussuri rivers, from North Korea to the south by the Yalu River and Tumen River, and from the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region to the west by the Greater Khingan Range. The heartland of the region is the Northeast China Plain." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_China. - Mod.CRD
