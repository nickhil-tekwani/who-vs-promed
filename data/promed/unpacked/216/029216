Onondaga County Interim Health Commissioner, Michelle Mignano, was notified by the New York State Department of Health this week [week of 22 Sep 2014] that an Onondaga County adult resident has been diagnosed with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). Ms Mignano explained, "This is the 2nd known human case of EEE this year [2014]. It is essential that residents consistently take measures to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes." Mignano stated that the individual is currently hospitalized and is in stable condition. To protect the privacy of this patient and of their family, additional details are not being shared with the public.

Although we are experiencing cooler evenings and mosquito numbers are down, residents should continue to practice personal protection measures to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes until the 1st hard frost. Mosquitoes are most active between dusk and dawn. Personal protection is advised during outdoor activities. Personal protection measures include wearing shoes and socks, long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt when outside for a long period of time. Applying a mosquito repellent containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535 is also recommended to prevent mosquito bites.

Symptoms of EEE disease often appear 4--10 days after someone is bitten by an infected mosquito. If you or someone you know is experiencing flu-like symptoms, including fever and headache, contact your local medical provider. EEE is a more serious disease than WNV and carries a high mortality rate for those who contract the serious encephalitis form of the illness. Symptoms may include high fever, severe headache, stiff neck, and sore throat. There is no specific treatment for the disease, which can lead to seizures and coma.

[ProMED-mail regrets the late posting of this report, but it just came in to us. Although the 1st hard frosts have terminated EEE virus transmission for the year, reporting this 2nd human case is of interest to provide a more complete picture of the geographic occurrence of cases. This year (2014) has been a very active one for transmission of EEE virus with both human and equine cases in the eastern and north central states of the USA.

This case and the previous one in Onondaga County occurred well within the geographic range of EEE virus in the eastern USA, where human and equine cases occur sporadically. The virus is maintained in passerine birds and transmitted among them by the black-tailed mosquito, _Culiseta melanura_. The species occasionally feeds on mammals, and may have been the bridge transmitter in the case above.

There is a vaccine commercially available for equine administration, but not for humans. Clinical cases in humans are very serious, with a case fatality rate of 33 per cent and significant neurological sequelae in survivors (see http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/). It is prudent to follow the recommendations above to reduce mosquito bites. Reducing mosquito breeding sites is also helpful, however, control of the black-tailed mosquito in swampy areas is more difficult.
