I read with interest the information about this syndrome in the ProMED
digest and I would like to clarify a few points about the disease, which
Dr. Harding and I initially described in 1996 (Proceedings, AASP (American
Association of Swine Practitioners) annual meeting, Quebec City, 1997).
It was October of 1996 that we confirmed PCV (Porcine Circovirus) in the
lesions using a polyclonal antibody and immunohistochemistry. We had been
seeing the disease since 1991 in Saskatchewan, but not until we obtained
the antibody from Dr. Gordon Allan in Belfast in 1996 did we confirm that
this tiny virus was present in the lesions of all tissues.
In regards to the news article statement that the disease "spread" from
Canada to other countries, it has been shown serologically that this
pathogenic circovirus has been present in many countries for decades. In
addition, I and co-workers have now reported cases of classic PMWS from the
UK from as early as 1986 in archived paraffin block sections, using both
polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for PCV2.
This was reported at the AAVLD (American Association of Veterinary
Laboratory Diagnosticians) meeting in 2000 but has not yet appeared in the
refereed literature. I have been following events as much as possible in
the UK, and I understand that indeed, this virus is creating havoc in many
herds.
PDNS is an immune complex form of the disease that is a problem here as
well, even in market-weight pigs. Serologic studies in many countries show
infection is very widespread and in fact, it is difficult in North America
to find a herd serologically negative for PCV2. We use the capture Elisa
technique to obtain the titres to both PCV1 and PCV2.
It is not yet known why infection is so common, but disease is not common
in all herds. There are obviously a lot of factors involved in the
production of disease yet to be discovered. However, Dr. Bolin in Iowa and
others now have successfully reproduced the entire syndrome and all of the
lesions using pure PCV2 in colostrum deprived/caesarian derived pigs and
conventional pigs. Therefore, Koch's postulates have been fulfilled.
It is not entirely true that adult pigs are not affected, since abortions,
mummies, stillbirths, and cardiac failure pigs up to 2 weeks or more of age
are now becoming a problem in some herds. We published an outbreak of
reproductive failure in the JVDI in 1999 or 2000 (senior author Dr. Keith
West) and we and other diagnostic labs have seen similar outbreaks in many
herds. These piglets and fetuses consistently have a nonsuppurative,
necrotizing myocarditis.
Hopefully a vaccine will eventually appear to help, but there is no proof
yet that this will be the answer. Good husbandry practices are crucial to
dealing with this new viral infection. All-in-all-out management, early
isolation of clinically affected pigs and strict sanitation practices are
all important. The mortality rate is virtually 100% in clinically affected
animals. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
