Bird Flu Cases Surging
----------------------
A total of 31 people have been infected this month [January 2015] with the H5N1 strain of the bird flu, Egypt's Ministry of Health announced Tuesday [27 Jan 2015]. So far, 10 have died from the virus. The rate of infection appears to be higher than it was in 2014, when 27 infections and 11 fatalities were reported.

Meanwhile, in Nigeria, 11 out of the country's 36 states have reported cases of the bird flu. Nigerian Agricultural and Rural Development Minister Akinwumi Adesina said Thursday [29 Jan 2015], "At the time of my briefing the nation on 21 Jan 2015, 7 states had reported cases of the bird flu. As of yesterday [28 Jan 2015], a total of 11 states have reported positive cases."

It's hardly Ebola, but H5N1 is the most highly pathogenic strain of bird flu and has reached throughout Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It is one strain out of dozens of bird flu types, 5 of which have been shown to be a threat to humans: H5N1, H7N3, H7N7, H7N9 and H9N2.

Nigeria recorded in 2007 the 1st human death from the H5N1 strain, which lives in poultry and is transmittable to humans. It predominately strikes rural areas where standards for handling meat and monitoring of livestock are lower.

The H5N8 strain was detected in a California [USA] turkey farm on 26 Jan 2015, just weeks after China banned US poultry in response to an outbreak of 2 separate virus strains of bird flu in Whatcom County, Washington, the USDA [US Department of Agriculture] said. No fatalities or human infections have been reported in the US or Canada in 2015.
