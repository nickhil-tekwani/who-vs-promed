The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) has become aware of several cases of diarrheal illness from northwest Missouri, possibly caused by Shiga-toxin producing _Escherichia coli_, including one confirmed as _E. coli_ O103. These may be related to the consumption of locally-produced, raw (unpasteurized) dairy products.

DHSS recommends that any person who has signs or symptoms of EHEC infection seek medical care. Health care providers should evaluate patients adequately to determine if testing for EHEC infection is warranted.

Symptoms include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea (which is often bloody), and vomiting. If there is fever, it usually is not very high. Most patients' symptoms improve within 5-7 days, but some patients go on to develop hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), usually about a week after the diarrhea starts. The classic triad of findings in HUS are acute renal damage, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Use of antibiotics in patients with suspected EHEC infections is not recommended until complete diagnostic testing can be performed and EHEC infection is ruled out. Some studies have shown that administering antibiotics in patients with EHEC infections might increase their risk of developing HUS. However, clinical decision making must be tailored to each individual patient. There may be indications for antibiotics in patients with severe intestinal inflammation if perforation is of concern.

[Although it is not yet established that unpasteurized dairy products are the vehicle of transmission in this outbreak, certainly these products are well known sources of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ either O157 or non-O157, as well as a large selection of other pathogenic microbes including zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, and _Coxiella burnetii_. Pathogenic microbes also include non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ species, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A.

In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (1). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (2), the O103 serotype being the implicated strain in this outbreak.

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify VTEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (3), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.

Clinically, the O157 infections had a higher frequency of bloody stools, fecal leukocytes, and abdominal pain with shorter symptom duration. 5 (18 per cent) of O157 infections developed HUS; none of the non-O157 strains did. Since toxin assay did not identify all O157 strains found on sMAC plates, the investigators did not advocate performing toxin assay alone. Non-O157 can produce hemolytic-uremic syndrome, as demonstrated by a cluster of O121 cases associated with a lake in Connecticut, USA (4).

Since toxin assays are not uniformly performed in many areas, and most cases do not produce HUS, it is likely that cases due to non-O157 strains are being missed. How frequent this phenomenon will become over time is unclear.

Because of the higher risk of morbidity and mortality in EHEC infections treated with antimicrobials (5), antimicrobials should not be used for known acute cases.
