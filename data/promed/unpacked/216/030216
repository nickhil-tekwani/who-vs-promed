[1] Cholera - Cuba (Artemis Province)

A Cuban of about 65 years of age died of cholera in the village of Bahia Honda, along with 16 other people who were sent to the Institute of Tropical Medicine Pedro Kour√≠ (IPK) in Havana, apparently after eating lobsters at a family feast, lobsters contaminated with the cholera bacillus. This was reported to Marti Noticias by independent journalist Moses Leonardo Rodriguez from a town adjacent to Bahia Honda in the province of Artemis.

Local health authorities are focusing on direct contact with the population the same precautionary measures taken during the recent outbreak of cholera in Manzanillo, but without mentioning the disease by its name.

The cases in Bahia Honda do not seem to be related to the outbreak in Manzanillo.

[3] Cholera - Haiti

The UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti says it has seen a "slight rise" in the number of cholera cases following the recent passage of Tropical Storm Isaac. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a bulletin Saturday, 8 Sep 2012, that an average of 180 new cases of cholera a day were reported between 24-29 Aug 2012, during the period the storm struck. There was an average of 78 new cases a day reported in the full week before the storm. The increase followed a decline in the average number of daily cholera infections, from 241 in late July 2012 to 115 in August 2012, according to the Haitian health ministry.

Cholera has infected more than 588 000 people and killed 7500 others, health officials say, since it was introduced to Haiti in October 2010 likely by a unit of U.N. peacekeepers from Nepal, where the disease is endemic.

Tropical Storm Isaac killed at least 24 people in Haiti when floodwaters swept them away or falling trees or walls crushed them; 3 others went missing. There was also considerable damage to livestock and cattle.
