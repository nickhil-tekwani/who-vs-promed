[Mosquitoes carrying western equine encephalitis (WEE) virus were trapped
in a swamp in Tucson on 21 August 1999. Although this is the first positive
test for WEE virus in Pima County, there were 11 positive tests for WEE
virus in Maricopa and Pinal Counties in July and August. There are no known
cases of humans getting the disease so far this year. There was also one
positive test for St. Louis encephalitis [virus or antibody in a mammal or
bird? - Mod.CHC in Pinal County.
Public health authorities are urging residents to take steps to protect
themselves against mosquitoes and to reduce mosquito breeding areas.
Comment. Arizona is experiencing a longer-than-normal monsoon season this
year. It should taper off in another two weeks or so, which will help limit
mosquito breeding habitat.
