[There has been no change in epidemiological week 26 (24-30 Jun
2007), since one human West Nile (WN) virus infection (undefined
clinically) was reported previously (ProMED-mail 20070705.2141). One
West Nile virus positive dead bird (corvid) was previously reported
in Ontario in the 14 Jun 2007 WN virus update (ProMED-mail 20070601.1776).

2007 West Nile virus activity in the United States (through 10 Jul 2007)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Human cases have been reported from:
State / Neuroinvasion* / *West Nile* fever** / Other, Unspecified***
/ Total **** / Fatalities
Arkansas / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1 / 0
California / 0 / 3 / 0 / 3 / 0
Colorado / 0 / 2 / 0 / 2/ 0
Illinois / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1 / 0
Iowa / 0 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Mississippi / 3 / 3 / 0 / 6 / 1

North Dakota / 0 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
South Dakota / 0 / 7 / 0 / 7 / 0
Texas / 0 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
TOTALS / 5 / 21 / 0 / 26 / 1
* cases with neurological manifestations (such as WN encephalitis,
meningitis*, and myelitis)
** cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.
"Neuroinvasive disease" refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
"West Nile fever" refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and, therefore, it is
optional whether or not state health departments report these cases
to CDC. [Further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus
disease and West Nile fever can be found on the CDC website at the
URL provided above].
"Other" includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis, or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
"Unspecified" cases are those for which sufficient clinical
information was not provided.
"Total human cases reported to CDC:" These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2007, reported
to ArboNET by state and local health departments. ArboNET is the
national electronic surveillance system established by CDC to assist
states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses.
Information regarding 2007 virus/disease activity is posted when such
cases are reported to CDC.

2007 West Nile virus activity in the United States (through 10 Jul 2007)
-----------------------------------------------
Data are being collected from state and local health departments on a
weekly basis and are reported to the CDC ArboNET for the following 5
categories: wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases,
veterinary cases, and mosquito surveillance. Maps detailing
county-level wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases,
veterinary cases, and mosquito surveillance data are published each
week on the collaborative USGS (US Geological Survey)/CDC West Nile
virus website.
As of 10 Jul 2007, human, avian, animal, or mosquito West Nile virus
(WNV) infections have been reported to CDC ArboNET from the following

Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming.
WNV antibody-positive sentinel animals (birds and/or horses) have
been found in Arizona, California, Florida, and Utah. [Note: not all
states have WNV sentinel programs. - Mods.JW/TY]
WNV equine infections have been reported from Arizona, California,
Idaho, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.
WNV has been detected in dead wild birds in California, Mississippi,
New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, and Texas.
WNV has been detected in mosquito pools collected in Arizona,
California, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana,
Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South

[Other reported instances of WN virus detection not included in the
CDC sites above: a magpie (_Pica hudsonia_) in Fallon, Churchill
County, NV and a bird (species not given; presumably dead) in
Flagstaff, Coconino County, AZ. WN virus transmission to sentinel
chickens was reported in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (see the 14
Jun 2007 WN virus update (ProMED-mail 20070614.1947). - Mod.TY]
