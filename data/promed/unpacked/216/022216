The Elbistan provincial Department of Food, Agriculture and Animal Husbandry suspects several cases of an exotic African disease of cattle, lumpy skin disease, in the village Catova.

It is believed that the disease has been introduced by smuggling of cattle from Middle Eastern countries such as Syria and Iraq. Blood and skin samples have been obtained and sent to a veterinary research institute for laboratory diagnosis. Measures are being undertaken by the authorities to control the disease and prevent its spread to other villages.

According to the director of the District Food, Agriculture and Livestock Directorate, Recep Yilmaz, this African disease, which can be spread by flies, has never been seen before in Turkey.

Elbistan is a district in Kahramanmaras Province, central-southern Turkey (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbistan).

Since mid-2012, lumpy skin disease (LSD) in cattle has been reported from Israel, Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan. The disease is known to be endemic in Egypt. It will be surprising if this arthropod-borne virus is not circulating also in other countries in the region, particularly Syria. Requests for information on the situation in Iraq and the Arab peninsula are pending. In case the disease is confirmed in Turkey, a threat of its potential spread -- including to the Balkans -- either by animal movements or by vectors, is to be taken into consideration.

In Israel, general, countrywide vaccination of cattle has become operational since March 2013 and the incidence of disease has dropped abruptly, though sporadic cases are still being seen. Two live attenuated vaccines have been applied, namely the (fortified) sheep pox vaccine "POX-10," manufactured by JOVAC and the Neethling lumpy skin vaccine, manufactured by OBP. Investigations into the safety and efficacy of both vaccines under field conditions have been undertaken cooperatively by the State Veterinary Services, the Koret School of Veterinary Medicine and the "Hachaklait" Clinical Veterinary Services. Preliminary results are expected.

Confirmation of the disease in Turkey and, if confirmed, additional information, are requested. - Mod.AS
