New blueberry diseases confirmed in Michigan
--------------------------------------------
Michigan Department of Agriculture [MDA] Director Don Koivisto today
[31 Jul 2009] announced 2 exotic blueberry diseases have been
identified in Michigan for the 1st time -- blueberry shock and
blueberry scorch. Both viral plant diseases have the potential to
cause significant losses to blueberry producers. MDA and Michigan
State University [MSU] officials are aggressively implementing a
response plan to eradicate these diseases.

Michigan is the nation's number one blueberry producer with
blueberries valued at USD 124 million in 2008. The MDA has been
watching for these diseases due to their presence in certain West
Coast and mid-Atlantic states and taking steps to prevent them from
entering the state through issuance of an external quarantine in 2002
and through routine sampling. "Although not totally unexpected, we
are very disappointed these 2 serious diseases have been identified
in southwest Michigan," Koivisto says.

Annemiek Schilder, MSU, was part of the team that identified
blueberry shock in a research plot in Fennville. Blueberry scorch
virus was discovered at a private farm in west Michigan. The infected
plants have been destroyed and MDA agents are testing adjacent areas
to verify blueberry scorch disease has not spread.

There are no known cures for either of these plant diseases. "We
believe that both diseases are restricted to small areas and can be
eradicated," Schilder says. "But buying plants from a nursery selling
virus-tested plants is the best way to prevent further infection
because both plant diseases can be spread via infected cuttings."

Vermont agriculture experts are keeping their fingers crossed
concerning a new deadly fungus that is threatening Maine's
blueberries. The cool, wet weather this summer [2009] is causing an
explosion in plant diseases that experts say are always around, but
are usually kept at bay by dry, warm periods. The coming weeks could
make the difference between salvaging the harvest and losing entire crops.

Scientists from the University of Maine this week confirmed
valdensinia leaf spot on wild blueberry plants in Sumner, Maine. The
deadly fungus devastated crops in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and
blueberry pathologist Seanna Annis said the disease could destroy
plants this summer [2009] and next [2010] in what is one of Maine's
most important agricultural products.

[_Blueberry scorch virus_ (BlScV; genus _Carlavirus_) has been
described as a heterogeneous collection of strains, including the
strains associated with blueberry scorch on the west coast of North
America and others associated with Sheep Pen Hill disease on the east
coast. The virus appears to be transmitted by aphids and by grafting.

_Blueberry shock virus_ (B1ShV; genus _Ilarvirus_) was first detected
in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The virus is pollen
borne and also transmitted by grafting and mechanical inoculation.

Blueberry scorch and shock disease symptoms are similar and may
include leaf scorching, dieback of shoot tips and twigs, and flower
blight. Fruit production and shoot growth are seriously reduced. Both
viruses spread quickly through a crop from the point of 1st
infection. Certified virus free planting material is essential in the
management of these viruses.

Valdensinia leaf drop (or leaf spot) of blueberries (_Vaccinium_
species) is caused by the fungus _Valdensinia heterodoxa_. Severe
losses have been reported in Canadian blueberry plantings through
rapid defoliation and failure of berries to mature in size.
Fungicides may be effective in suppressing the disease, but are not
able to eradicate it from a field.
