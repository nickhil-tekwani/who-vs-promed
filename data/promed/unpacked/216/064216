Goss's bacterial wilt confirmed in Indiana
------------------------------------------
There is a new disease of corn on the scene in Indiana: Goss's wilt
[GW]. The disease was confirmed at the Purdue Plant and Pest
Diagnostic Laboratory this week on field corn and popcorn samples
submitted from northern Indiana. GW infects susceptible varieties of
sweet corn, popcorn, and hybrid corn. This is Purdue's 1st
confirmation in Indiana since the disease was discovered in Nebraska
in 1969. GW is found sporadically throughout the Midwest.

Early hailstorms and recent heavy rains and windstorms likely
contributed to the infection and dispersal of GW in Indiana.
Currently, the susceptibility level of most corn varieties to GW in
Indiana is unknown. Partially resistant hybrids are available in
other areas of the Midwest, such as Nebraska, but hybrid performance
in Indiana is unknown at this time. It is important to note that
fungicides will NOT control Goss's wilt, since the disease is caused
by bacteria and not a fungus.

Goss's wilt prevalent in western Iowa
-------------------------------------
This past week [4-10 Aug 2008] several corn samples infected with
Goss's wilt were submitted to the Iowa State University Plant and
Insect Diagnostic Clinic. Tamra Jackson at University of Nebraska,
Lincoln has also reported an increase in the prevalence of GW in
Nebraska this growing season [2008].

GW was first reported on corn in Nebraska nearly 40 years ago; since
then it has been reported across the entire Corn Belt. Symptoms of GW
being reported in Iowa are leaf blight of the leaves at the top of
corn plants causing growers to worry about anthracnose top dieback.
The disease may also be misdiagnosed as Northern leaf blight or
Stewart's disease. There is nothing that can be done this growing
season [2008] to manage GW. Partially resistant hybrids remain the
most effective management tool for this disease.

[Goss's wilt and blight of maize is caused by the Gram-positive
bacterium _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _nebraskensis_. It is a
persistent and economically serious disease of susceptible maize
hybrids in the USA. The bacterium can also affect some grasses, which
may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms include systemic wilting
and/or leaf lesions and blighting. Infection of leaves, stems, and
roots occurs primarily through wounds (mechanical, hail, or insect
damage), and plants are susceptible at all growth stages. The
pathogen is seed transmitted and overwinters on crop debris and maize
kernels. Disease management includes cultural practices to minimise
inoculum, crop rotation, and use of resistant crop varieties.

Subsp. _nebraskensis_ has so far not been reported outside the USA,
however other subspecies affecting different hosts are found
elsewhere. For example, potato ring rot with a reported yield loss of
up to 50 percent is caused by subsp. _sepedonicus_, and subsp.
_michiganensis_ causes bacterial canker of tomatoes resulting in up
to 70 percent yield loss.

The other diseases mentioned above are: Stewart's wilt caused by the
bacterium _Erwinia stewartii_; northern leaf blight caused by the
fungus _Setosphaeria turcica_; and anthracnose caused by the fungi
_Colletotrichum graminicola_ or _Glomerella tucumanensis_.
