North Dakota beef herd being tested for bovine TB
-------------------------------------------------
A North Dakota beef herd is being tested for bovine tuberculosis [TB],
following the identification of a cow with a TB lesion at a Minnesota meat
processing plant. "We are in the early stages of the investigation, and
complete results of the herd tests won't be known for several weeks," said
Dr Susan Keller, state veterinarian, on Friday [5 Dec 2008]. Keller said
that a suspect lesion on the animal was detected through routine inspection
at a processing plant in Long Prairie, Minnesota, and that pathological
tests at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa,
confirmed the diagnosis of bovine TB. A traceback determined that the
animal came from a livestock operation in southwestern North Dakota.

North Dakota has been officially TB-free since [1 Jan] 1976. Under federal
guidelines, that status remains in effect. The last time a North Dakota
herd tested positive for the disease was in 1999 in Morton County.

A chronic bacterial disease that affects primarily cattle, bovine TB can be
transmitted to any warm-blooded animal. In its early stages, clinical signs
are not visible, making diagnosis difficult. Later symptoms may include
low-grade fever, lethargy, emaciation, anorexia, pneumonia, chronic
coughing, and lymph node enlargement.
