Sanpete County deer tests positive for chronic wasting disease
-------------------------------------------------
The Division of Wildlife Resources identified yet another Utah deer
infected with chronic wasting disease (CWD). This deer was located
during a depredation effort in the Central Region, near Fountain
Green in Sanpete County. 5 deer were culled from agricultural fields
where they were doing crop damage, but only one adult doe was
determined to test positive for CWD. This is the first infected
animal identified in central Utah.
2 buck deer taken in Utah during 2003's archery hunt tested positive
for CWD, the Division of Wildlife Resources announced 17 Sep 2003.
Both of those deer were taken in eastern Utah. One was taken on
Diamond Mountain north of Vernal. The other was taken on the LaSal
Mountains east of Moab. Both deer were adult animals, meaning they
were at least 2 1/2 years old. The hunters who took the deer have
been notified that the animals they took had CWD.
The discovery, announced Monday, represents the farthest west that
CWD has been found in a wild population in the United States,
according to Leslie MacFarlane, the Division of Wildlife Resources'
lead biologist on the progressive neurological disease that can kill
deer and elk. The diseased deer was one of 5 killed while feasting on
a farmer's alfalfa field near the town of Fountain Green.
"None of the 5 deer looked sick," MacFarlane said. So far, 5 deer in
Utah have been confirmed with the disease -- but this latest
discovery places the disease in the heart of the state's prime
hunting region just weeks before the start of the traditional -- and
most popular -- rifle deer season opener. The first CWD case in the
state, detected in an animal on Diamond Mountain north of Vernal,
was announced in February 2003. Another confirmation came from a doe
in the La Sal Mountains east of Moab in May 2003.
