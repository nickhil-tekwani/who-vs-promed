The phenotype of the _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Poona associated with
cantaloupe that have been isolated in my laboratory is atypical, in that
these strains are weak or negative for hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production.
We have identified 2 cases associated with the outbreak confirmed by
serology and pulsed field gel electrophoresis pattern at the Washington
State Public Health Laboratory. We sent 3 additional isolates for
confirmation. All 5 of the patients with confirmed or presumptive infection
_Salmonella enterica_ serovar Poona have been children aged 4 months to 11
years.
