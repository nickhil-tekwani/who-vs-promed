The South African Broadcasting Corporation reported this evening that
approximately 600 schoolchildren had required emergency treatment at
regional hospitals and medical centres for acute food poisoning. The
children, who were attending the opening of the All Africa Games, had
apparently eaten food from one of the contracted caterers for the event.
Reports stated that the food eaten was chicken and beef. The superintendent
of the Johannesburg Academic Hospital was quoted at 22h00 local time as
saying that a number of children required ongoing treatment, and were being
observed.
At this time, no comment was available from local public health officials
who were investigating the episode.
