Foot-and-mouth outbreaks under investigation
--------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Public Security has asked police in the central
provinces of Quang Tri and Thanh Hoa to cooperate in finding the
culprits causing the outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in
cattle there. The disease has taken its toll again in Quang Tri since
the middle of last month [June 2007] by which the epidemic had been
under control for 2 weeks.
According to an initial survey of the province's animal health
bureau, Thuan Thanh Co. Ltd. bought 49 cross-bred cows from Thanh
Hoa to supply the forestry and agriculture promotion center in
Quang Tri. The cows were then distributed to 31 households in Dakrong
and Gio Linh. The problem is that they were not quarantined when
purchased.
Police are making clear the alleged violations of Thuan Thanh Co.
This case is similar to the one that happened in Kien Giang Province
a year ago [in 2006], when cows were transferred there from Dong Nai Province.
There are nearly 800 cows and buffalos infected with the disease at
the moment in many districts such as Dakrong, Gio Linh, Cam Lo, Trieu
Phong, Huong Hoa and Con Co. According to the Department for Animal
Health, the disease is still spreading in Quang Tri and Thanh Hoa.

[The FMDV serotype responsible for the described spread is not
disclosed; the previous outbreaks (see archive 20070706.2152) were
caused by FMDV serotype Asia 1, probably introduced from the northern
(Chinese) frontier.
Potentially, 2 other serotypes are to be considered as well: serotype
O, which seems to be endemic to Viet Nam, reported throughout 2006
and during the 1st trimester of 2007 -- see map at
<http://www.seafmd-rcu.oie.int/fmd_se_asia.php?reptype=map&state=VNM&month=03&year=2007>
and serotype A, which was reported during January-April 2006 in 4
provinces of South Viet Nam, but not later (up to the last available
monthly report, March 2007).
Viet Nam's last FMD report to the OIE was submitted on 24 May 2007;
an update, including serotyping of the currenly circulating
virus(es), details on vaccination performance and on vaccines used
will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
