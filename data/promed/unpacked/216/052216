People exposed to rabid raccoon on Hilton Head Island
-----------------------------------------------------
A total of 16 people who were exposed to a rabid raccoon on Hilton
Head Island are being treated by a physician after the raccoon tested
positive for the disease.

Twenty of their pets are under quarantine for 45 days, said Clair
Boatwright, spokeswoman for the South Carolina Department of Health
and Environmental Control (DHEC). There are also 7 more people who
might need the treatment, she said.

Though the raccoon was found on Hilton Head Island, Boatwright was
not sure if all of those exposed are Beaufort County residents. DHEC
would not release any names.

None of those exposed experienced any symptoms, which is why DHEC can
treat them. "Once you have a symptom, it has reached the brain and it
is fatal," Boatwright said.

She urges anyone who comes in contact with a wild animal to leave it
alone. If contact with a rabid animal occurs, Boatwright said the
incident should be reported to DHEC and the person must seek medical attention.

[This article seems incomplete. It tells us about 16 people and
possibly 7 more. It also tells us about number of pets.

What is does not tell us is how did this many people and their pets
get exposed to 1 raccoon and over what period of time? It also does
not tell us the vaccination status of the pets that are in
quarantine. This number of pets and this number of people being
exposed would seem to indicate that a public education campaign may
be necessary.

If some one in the DHEC's office has more information it would be
nice if they would share it. - Mod.TG]
