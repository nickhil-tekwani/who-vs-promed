According to the Bryan County Health Department, a horse in Bryan County has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

EEE virus is a mosquito-borne virus that causes swelling of the brain and is fatal in horses 70 to 90 percent of the time. EEE has also been detected in the mosquito population in western Chatham County, and a horse in Effingham County tested positive for EEE earlier this month [August 2017].

The health department encourages horse and large animal owners to vaccinate their animals against the virus and to clean out watering sources, such as buckets and troughs every 3 to 4 days to prevent mosquitoes from breeding in those areas.

For more information on EEE, see: http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/.

A horse from Ashtabula County was recently confirmed to have eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) by the Ohio Department of Agriculture's (ODA) Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory.

The animal was euthanized in late July 2017 after showing neurological signs. The animal was not vaccinated against the disease and lived near a low-lying area typically prone to harboring mosquitoes. EEE is often transmitted by mosquitoes and can be transmitted to humans; however, only a few cases are reported each year, and most infected persons report no apparent illness.

[The arbovirus season is upon us. The watch word is "vaccinate!"

The EEE vaccination is usually combined with western EE, West Nile virus and tetanus. This is cheap insurance to protect your animal from these diseases. If you have not already vaccinated, please do so now. If you vaccinated longer than 6 months ago, please revaccinate, as EEE immunity wanes the fastest. - Mod.TG
