Another 7 cases of West Nile encephalitis have been registered in Voronezh
and the Voronezh region, the press service for the regional department of
Rospotrebnadzor has reported. All in all, 13 cases of West Nile
encephalitis were registered in the region in the period between 17 Aug --
6 Sep [2010]. According to Rospotrebnadzor, 11 of these people live in
Voronezh, one lives in the Boguchary district, and one lives in the
Semiluksk district. Most patients are aged between 20 and 39 and have been
listed as in a stable condition.

The virus has appeared in the region as a result of the abnormal heat,
which lasted for 3 months.

[Presumably, the unusually hot summer weather has accelerated the expansion
of WN virus mosquito vector populations, and it must be assumed that the
susceptible avian host population is abundant enough to facilitate
increased transmission, with spill-over into humans of the area. The
Voronezh region is adjacent to the Volgograd area where the previously
reported cases of human WN virus infection have been reported recently (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20100902.3141). It is somewhat unusual to have
clinical cases of WN virus encephalitis occurring in young adults in the
absence of cases among the elderly.

[In the ProMED-mail post of 24 May 2010 (ProMED-mail archive no.
20100524.1725), Dr Guiseppe Ippolito indicated that WNV circulation in
Italy has been found since 2008 in animals, humans, and mosquitoes. Up
until now, the spread has been demonstrated in 3 regions of the north east
(Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Lombardy). The current report indicates that
transmission is occurring in the south, as well.

The Turkish Health Ministry has announced that 3 people have died and 4
more have been infected with the West Nile virus in Turkey. All the victims
came from the western Turkish provinces Manisa, Aydin, and Isparta. They
were all elderly people and had other serious illnesses, the Turkish Health
Ministry has announced. And 2 of the infected people have been hospitalized.

The Turkish authorities have announced that there was no danger of a West
Nile virus outbreak and no serious threats for the public health. Tiger
mosquitoes are reported to be the carriers of the West Nile virus, which
begins with a fever, high temperature, nausea, and vomiting, which are the
symptoms of an ordinary virus infection. However, the symptoms turn very
fast into encephalitis and meningitis and the infected need urgent
hospitalization.

[The above report indicates that WN virus is being transmitted in Turkey by
the "tiger mosquito". If they are referring to the Asian tiger mosquito,
_Aedes albopictus_, its vector role there is incorrect, although this
species is biologically capable of transmitting the virus. It is doubtless
being transmitted by _Culex_ mosquitoes.
