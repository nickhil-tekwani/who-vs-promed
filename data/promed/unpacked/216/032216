The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today [11 Nov 2016] received notification of 2 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) from the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC), and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food, and environmental hygiene, both locally and during travel.

The 2 patients are:
- a female farmer aged 77 from Huzhou, Zhejiang, in serious condition. She bought poultry from a live poultry market before onset; and
- a man aged 89 from Suzhou, Jiangsu, in serious condition.

"As winter approaches, based on the seasonal pattern of avian influenza viruses, their activity in the Mainland is expected to increase. The public should avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings and should not visit live poultry markets and farms to prevent avian influenza," a spokesman for the CHP said.

From 2013 to date, 777 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities. "We will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments," the spokesman said.

The CHP's Port Health Office conducts health surveillance measures at all boundary control points. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up.

The display of posters and broadcasting of health messages in departure and arrival halls as health education for travellers is under way. The travel industry and other stakeholders are regularly updated on the latest information.

Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas with fever or respiratory symptoms, should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention and reveal their travel history to doctors.

Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds, or their droppings in affected areas. The public should remain vigilant and take heed of the advice against avian influenza below:
- do not visit live poultry markets and farms. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings;
- if contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;
- avoid entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered and contact with surfaces, which might be contaminated by droppings of poultry or other animals;
- poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
- wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose, or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels, and door knobs); and when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
- cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;
- avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
- wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.

[Human cases of influenza A/H7N9 continue to be reported sporadically from China and adjoining regions as outlined in the report above and they are mostly cases with documented history of exposure to poultry. As there are few or no signs of apparent infection in poultry, it is difficult to provide concrete advice to individuals handling poultry and therefore surveillance activities need to be continued. - Mod.UBA
