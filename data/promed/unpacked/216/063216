A total of 2 more tilapia fish farms in Taoyuan have been hit by the tilapia lake virus (TiLV), bringing the total number of farms affected to 9 since the virus was 1st reported in the city in June [2017], the Council of Agriculture (COA) said.

All 9 infected fish farms are in the city's Guanyin District, according to Shih Tai-hua, deputy director-general of COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine.

Since the virus was 1st reported in Taoyuan on June 13 [2017], the city government has ordered inspections of all ponds within a 3-kilometer [1.86 miles] radius of the site, which included 22 other tilapia farms.

On June 23 [2017], the inspections were expanded to cover a 5-kilometer [3.10 miles] radius, hence adding 24 more farms to the list.

Shih said the results of the recent inspections showed that 2 more ponds have been struck by the lake virus.

Although the virus only infects tilapia and there is no risk of it being passed on to humans, it is incurable and is listed as a major infectious disease by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).

Because the TiLV was only discovered recently, the lack of data pertaining to this new disease has made it difficult for the government to determine where it came from, according to COA Deputy Minister Huang Jin-cheng.

The government has since stepped up measures to contain an outbreak of tilapia lake virus, he said.

To date, 7 countries have reported the presence of TiLV, after Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, Israel, Thailand, China, and Taiwan.
