The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship said that 14 cattle herds, primarily in eastern Iowa, have had animals contract the epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) virus.

EHD is a virus that is spread by biting midges and primarily affects deer. A hard freeze kills midges and will stop the spread of the virus.

EHD can cause illness in cattle, including fever, ulcers in the mouth and gums, swollen tongue, excessive salivation, and lameness or stiffness when walking. Death loss is uncommon in cattle, and there is no evidence that the EHD virus can infect humans.

EHD rarely affects cattle, but the wild white-tailed deer population in the southern and eastern areas of Iowa is seeing the disease again this year [2013]. EHD is common in white-tailed and other deer in some years and can be fatal in these animals.

Cattle farmers are advised to use insect control as a preventive measure to reduce the risk of having cattle that become infected. Farmers who notice signs of illness in cattle are encouraged to contact their veterinarian immediately.

[This article does not tell us what tests were used on these animals. If they were not tested, then it may not be EHD, but rather its closely related cousin, bluetongue virus.

The disease is transmitted by "no-see-ums" or biting midges. These insects transmit the disease to deer and occasionally to cattle. A killing frost will help eliminate the disease.

The state veterinarian discussion does not mention by what method the disease was diagnosed.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is one of the most important diseases of deer in North America. The epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses (EHDV) are widespread in white-tailed deer and periodically cause serious epidemics in wild populations.

The epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses belong to the genus _Orbivirus_, family _Reoviridae_. 10 serotypes of EHDV are known worldwide.

Some of these viruses can also cause disease in cattle. In the USA, EHD in cattle is uncommon, rarely fatal, and usually associated with an epidemic in deer. However, an EHDV serogroup virus called the Ibaraki virus causes serious epidemics in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan that may have affected as many as 39 000 cattle. The disease caused by the Ibaraki virus is known as Ibaraki disease; some authorities consider it to be a synonym for epizootic hemorrhagic disease in cattle.

The Ibaraki virus is closely related to EHDV. According to some authors, it is a distinct virus belonging to the EHDV serogroup. According to others, the Ibaraki virus and the Australian (but not the American) EHDV serotype 2 are nearly identical topotypes. There is more than one strain of the Ibaraki virus.

The viruses of the EHDV serogroup are transmitted by biological vectors, usually biting midges in the genus _Culicoides_. In North America, _C. variipennis_ is the major vector. Some species of gnats and mosquitoes can also transmit EHDV.

Ibaraki disease in cattle is characterized by fever, anorexia, and difficulty swallowing. The swallowing disorders are caused by damage to the striated muscles of the pharynx, larynx, esophagus and tongue, and may lead to dehydration, emaciation, and aspiration pneumonia. Edema, hemorrhages, erosions, and ulcerations may be seen in the mouth, on the lips, and around the coronets. The animals may be stiff and lame, and the skin may be thickened and edematous. Abortions and stillbirths have also been reported in some epidemics. Some affected cattle die.

Outside Japan, Korea and Taiwan, most EHDV infections in cattle appear to be subclinical. Symptomatic infections resemble Ibaraki disease, but tend to be less severe. Typical signs include fever, oral ulcers, salivation, lameness associated with coronitis, and weight loss. In pregnant cows, the fetus may be resorbed or develop hydranencephaly if it is infected between 70 and 120 days of gestation. Deaths are uncommon with the North American strains of EHDV; however, some animals may be lame and unthrifty for a prolonged period. Epizootic hemorrhagic disease has not been reproduced in experimentally infected cattle; although animals become viremic, they remain asymptomatic.

More information on the type of diagnostic testing used to identify this disease and if the testing/investigation protocol involved distinguishing this disease from FMD would be greatly appreciated.
