Date of confirmation of the event: 18 May 2020
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 20 Nov 2019
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: African horse sickness virus
Serotype: pending
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks, Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Nelson, Hhohho
Date of start of the outbreak: 8 May 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 28 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: It is a stable with a population of different breeds of horses. The horses are of different ages and sexes. They are free-range but stabled between 3pm and 9h30am. The stables are sprayed every night with an insect repellent and there are mosquito nets. The horses are dipped once every week with flumethrin. There is a routine African horse sickness vaccination program and were last vaccinated in October 2019 with a live attenuated vaccine which protects against serotypes 2, 6, 7 and 8.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 3.57 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors

Epidemiological comments: Note from the World Animal Health Information and Analysis Department: Swaziland has officially been renamed The Kingdom of Eswatini. However, due to technical constraints, country names cannot be modified in the current WAHIS without altering the integrity of historical data. Thus, the former name Swaziland will be kept until the new version of WAHIS is launched.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of vectors, quarantine; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, (OIE's reference laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Equidae / reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 18 May 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["African horse sickness (AHS) is an infectious but noncontagious viral disease affecting all species of equidae caused by an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae and characterized by alterations in the respiratory and circulatory functions. AHS is transmitted by at least 2 species of _Culicoides_".

"A total of 9 different serotypes have been described. All serotypes of AHS occur in eastern and southern Africa. AHS serotypes 9, 4 and 2 have been found in North and West Africa, from where they occasionally spread into countries surrounding the Mediterranean. Examples of outbreaks that have occurred outside Africa are: in the Middle East (1959-1963), in Spain (serotype 9, 1966, serotype 4, 1987-1990), and in Portugal (serotype 4, 1989)".

[Note: In March 2020, AHS serotype 1 was reported in Thailand. As Mod.AS mentioned in ProMED-mail posting 20200523.7369326: "This is the 1st time that AHS has been reported in South-East Asia and the 1st detection of AHS serotype 1 outside the African continent. Previous outbreaks outside Africa involved serotypes 9 and 4". - Mod.CRD].

"Laboratory diagnosis of AHS is essential. Although the clinical signs and lesions are characteristic, they can be confused with those of other equine diseases. As a viral disease, the laboratory diagnosis of AHS can be based on the identification of infectious virus, virus nucleic acid, viral antigens or specific antibodies. A wide variety of laboratory tests have been adapted for the detection of both AHS virus (AHSV) and specific antibodies".

"There is no evidence that humans can become infected with any field strain of AHSV, either through contact with naturally or experimentally infected animals or by virus manipulation in laboratories. Laboratory manipulations should be performed with appropriate containment determined by biorisk analysis".

AHS is one of the diseases for which the OIE grants official status. The map showing OIE Member Countries' official status for AHS (last update March 2020) is available at https://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/african-horse-sickness/en-ahs-carte/

As is mentioned in the epidemiological comments, Swaziland has officially been renamed The Kingdom of Eswatini. A map of Eswatini can be seen at https://geology.com/world/swaziland-satellite-image.shtml. - Mod.CRD
