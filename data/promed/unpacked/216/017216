Cattle disease outbreak in northwestern Nigeria
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) cattle
disease in Nigeria's northwestern state of Kebbi has killed more than
70 head of cattle, the official News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported
on Saturday [20 Nov 2004].
Alhaji Mohammadu Jabbo, permanent secretary of the Kebbi State Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources, was quoted as saying that 3 head of
cattle had been slaughtered for postmortem examination, which had confirmed
the disease as contagious bovine pleuropneumonia]. However, he did not
disclose any information about the death of cows affected by the disease,
saying that "we are yet to have the exact figure of the number of cows
affected by the disease." According to him, the state government has
procured vaccines worth 2 million Naira [USD 15 300] for the vaccination of
cattle in the affected local government areas. "The ministry has already set
up 10 committees to carry out the vaccination exercise," he said, adding
that "more than 40 000 head of cattle have been vaccinated."
The cattle disease reportedly broke out in 8 local government areas along
the border with the neighboring Niger Republic, including Arewa, Augie,
Bagudo, Dandi, Bunza, Shanga, Yauri Suru, and Koko Besse.
