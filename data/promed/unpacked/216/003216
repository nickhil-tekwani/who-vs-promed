[Re: ProMED-mail Anthrax - Europe: heroin cases, genomic analysis 20130409.1633522]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As it can be seen in our publication we considered and relied strongly on the available information on the outbreak strain in 2009/2010 published by Price at al, together with the colleagues in UK. (Price EP, Seymour ML, Sarovich DS et al: Molecular Epidemiologic Investigation of an Anthrax Outbreak among Heroin Users, Europe. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(8):1307-13).

However, detailed information on genotyping of the UK isolates from 2012 were not published to the best of our knowledge although it was mentioned that these strains would not differ from the other European isolates obtained in the same period of time. From our point of view, an intensive cooperation between the laboratories of affected countries in cross border health threat events and certainly in the case of anthrax in heroin users is important and necessary.

[Roland's comments are appreciated. Price et al's 2012 paper can be seen at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/8/11-1343_article.htm

I should point out that though 36 UK isolates were considered in the EID study, the SNP analyses were done in Flagstaff, Arizona, and a very limited whole genome sequencing. This just showed that the UK strains were SNP [single nucleotide polymorphism]-identical and very similar to an isolate from Turkey. I can only second Roland's comment on the need for close collaboration between neighbouring laboratories involved in cross-border health events as in these contaminated heroin cases, and for other diseases and pathogens. - Mod.MHJ]
