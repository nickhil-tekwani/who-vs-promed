Over 2000 families in 3 areas in the Ratnapura district have been
affected by chikungunya while 500 patients with fever sought
treatment at the Eheliyagoda hospital last Thursday [24 Apr 2008], a
Healthcare and Nutrition Ministry spokesman said.

The Ministry also warned of possible outbreaks of diseases like
dengue, malaria, and filaria following the rains the country is
experiencing. He said the Ministry has made arrangements to control
the outbreak under the direction of minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
"The Ministry alone cannot control any outbreak without public
cooperation. Of 75 blood samples collected from the patients in
Eheliyagoda, Kiriella, and Kuruwita, 68 tested positive for
chikungunya," the spokesman said.

The Ministry has sent drugs, vehicles, and doctors to Eheliyagoda
hospital. Doctors from the Epidemiology Unit, Colombo, Medical
Research Institute, Colombo, and Malaria Control Programme are
included in the team now in the affected areas.

According to the spokesman, the Ministry has already taken steps to
control the very high mosquito density in the affected area and
commenced fogging yesterday [27 Apr 2008]. Apart from fogging, the
Ministry launched an awareness campaign covering all homes through
PHIs on the importance of destroying mosquito-breeding places.

Ratnapura district is severely affected by diseases spread by
mosquitoes as it has a large number of abandoned gem mines while the
number of mines used to dig soil to produce bricks is also significantly high.
