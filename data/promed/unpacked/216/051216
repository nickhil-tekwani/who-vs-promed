In a press conference, the Loreto Government Regional Health
Directorate provided information related to measures to follow for
prevention of the transmission of hantavirus infection, which recently
took the life of a victim in our city [Loreto], the 1st which has
occurred in Peru. On 8 Jul [2011], a 29 year old a woman died in the
EsSalud Hospital, and the case was confirmed as a hantavirus
[infection] by tests done in the National Institute of Health.

Hantaviruses are found in some rodent species around the world. These
viruses are transmitted when infected rodents contaminate, with their
feces and urine, houses and buildings closed for a long time. People
who clean, dust, or sweep without protection become infected when they
breathe dust with feces or urine, with some [individuals] later
developing severe respiratory disease with intense coughing and
difficulty in breathing, which requires intensive care management.

Because of this, the Regional Health Directorate is carrying out the
necessary investigations with the help of professionals from the
General Directorate of Epidemiology and the National Institute of
Health to determine if this is an isolated case that was infected
accidentally.

[This is the same case as the one above, but with some additional
details. - Mod.TY]

The 1st case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) has been
confirmed (ELISA and PCR) in the Peruvian [Amazon], Iquitos, [Loreto
region] Peru. Sadly, the case was fatal, involving a 29 year old woman
who worked as a nature tourist guide near Iquitos city. After a 20 day
illness, she developed a clinical picture of serious respiratory
insufficiency in the Hospital III Iquitos-EsSalud. The pulmonary
disease specialist, Percy Sinti, was alert to the possibility of HPS,
and arranged for samples to be taken that were sent to the National
Institute of Health and the Center for Tropical Diseases Research of
the US Navy based in Iquitos, which confirmed the physician's
suspicions.

The patient died in the intensive care unit on 8 Jul 2011. Although
reports of serological evidence of hantavirus [infection], there has
never been a confirmed case in Peru. Following the confirmation,
epidemiological investigations of contacts and probable sites of
infection and the search for wild rodents, probable virus reservoir
hosts, have been initiated.

The Ministry of Public Health has confirmed 9 hantavirus [infection]
cases in the country this year [2011]. Of this number of infected
individuals, 2 people are currently admitted to the Central Hospital
of the Institute of Social Services (IPS), while the deaths of another
2 people are currently under investigation. The affected
[hospitalized] individuals are residents of Villa Hayes Chaco,
Presidente Hayes department [state of province equivalent], from the
same area as the cases who died of this disease, according to a press
conference yesterday [15 Jul 2011] at the IPS.

According to the most recent report from the Office of Health
Surveillance, Ministry of Health, so far this year [2011] there have
been 9 reported cases of the disease, whereas in 2009 there were 3
reported cases, and in 2010, one infected individual, the report
indicated.

Dr Ana Finandro of the epidemiology service, stated that the
hospitalized patients are from Villa Hayes, where another 2 people
died apparently from the same cause, according to symptoms that they
presented with. She said that the results of tests done on the victims
are awaited.

In 2008, in the Boqueron department, there was a hantavirus epidemic
and the year ended with about 30 cases and 4 deaths. At that time, the
health authorities attributed the outbreak in the Chaco area to
environmental problems from deforestation of the region, constant
fires, and land clearing that favored the urbanization of rats,
carriers of the virus that causes the disease, in the communities.

_Calomys laucha_, a rural rodent common in central Chaco areas, is
the one that transmits Laguna Negra hantavirus, according to Health
Surveillance director Dr Ivan Allende's explanation.

[In addition to Laguna Negra virus, other hantaviruses that can cause
HPS and are found in Paraguay (and their rodent hosts), from a list
kindly provided by Dr James Mills, include Bermejo (_Oligoryzomys
chacoensis_), Lechiguanas (_Oligoryzomys flavescens_), Central Plata
(_Oligoryzomys flavescens_), Anajatuba (possible HPS; _Oligoryzomys
fornesi_), Oran (__Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), and Juquitiba
(__Oligoryzomys nigripes_).
