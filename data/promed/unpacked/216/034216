Liberian authorities on Wednesday [16 May 2018] confirmed that 22 deaths have been recorded across the country following the outbreak of Lassa fever since January [2018].

In a statement, the National Public Health Institute of Liberia said the West African country had seen an increase in the outbreak with 81 suspected cases recorded so far.

However, 67 out of the 81 suspected cases tested negative following laboratory examination, according to the statement.

Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus.

The outbreak has so far occurred in Bong, Margibi, Nimba, and Montserrado, 4 counties out of Liberia's 15 counties.

The Liberian health authorities decried the high death rate, saying it was mostly caused by sick people coming to health facilities late for medical examination.

"Although Lassa fever is not new to Liberia, it is a deadly viral disease that requires urgent attention," the official statement said.

Humans usually become infected with the Lassa virus from exposure to urine or feces of infected _Mastomys_ [multimammate] rats. Other than common preventive measures such as washing hands regularly, the World Health Organization has recommended keeping cats.

[An earlier report indicated that there is an ongoing outbreak of Lassa fever in Liberia this year (2018). A 13 Apr 2018 WHO report stated that for the year 2018 until 13 Apr 2018, there were 67 suspected cases, and 9 confirmed cases have occurred in 6 counties. The above report indicated that 4 counties are involved in the current outbreak: Bong, Margibi, Nimba, and Montserrado, but the number of confirmed cases has increased to 22 fatal ones.

The situation where these Lassa fever cases acquired Lassa fever virus is not indicated. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta, as was likely the situation in these cases. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households employing the preventive measures. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.
