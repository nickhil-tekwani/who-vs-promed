Apac imposes livestock quarantine
---------------------------------
Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has attacked cattle in Apac district,
prompting the veterinary officer, Dr Ongu Elim, to announce a
quarantine on animal movement. Addressing the press on Tuesday [30
Dec 2008], Elim said the quarantine would affect Aduku and Abongomola
sub-counties, which have the highest prevalence of the contagious
animal fever.

The measures, he said, took immediate effect and warned tough action
against cattle-keepers and livestock dealers who do not obey the ban.
Elim said some of the symptoms include blisters and wounds in the
mouth and feet of an infected animal, forcing the animal to stop
grazing and moving. The disease, he said, could kill the animal after
weakening it. "We believe the measure will stop further spread of the
disease," Elim said.

He said the district had established animal check-points on all roads
including community access roads. "The farmers ought to cooperate
with the veterinary officers to eliminate it in the shortest time
possible," he said.

Elim said the agriculture ministry would send vaccines for free use
on all animals in the district.

FMD is a [sometimes] fatal viral infection of cloven-hoofed animals
such as cattle, water buffalos, sheep, goats, and pigs. It
drastically reduces milk output during lactation.

Although it does not affect human beings, he said, people who consume
the meat of an infected animal can spread the disease [this is not a
biological transmission; in fact, the virus can be spread mechanically
by various means, including contact-persons and animals, fomites,
fodder, vehicles. - Mod.AS]

It is transmitted [from infected animals] through, saliva, dung,
urine, milk, and semen and takes up to 4 days for the symptoms to
appear. Elim urged the local leaders to implement the quarantine.

Foot-and-mouth [disease] attacks Amuru district
-----------------------------------------------
A total of 40 head of cattle have died in Amuru in an outbreak of the
foot-and-mouth disease [FMD]. The district veterinary officer, Dr
James Ukwir, confirmed the presence of the disease and said over 2500
cattle had been affected in 3 sub-counties. "We confirmed the
outbreak 2 weeks ago in Amuru, Lamogi, and Pabbo," he revealed. "This
came about because of uncontrolled movement of cattle to the
district during the Christmas season," Ukwir said.

He said first aid would be given to the affected animals as they
waited for vaccines from the agriculture ministry [One wonders what
this first aid consists of? There is no specific treatment. - Mod.JW].
The disease, which is caused by a virus, has no cure and is directly
handled by the Government. Ukwir said the veterinary department would
sensitise the community on how to guard against unnecessary movement
of animals.

He said the animals died due to complications of Nagana [animal
African trypanosomiasis] that had broken out, and the foot-and-mouth
disease was confirmed in the district. "Foot-and-mouth disease does
not bring any complication in human beings. I only advise people not
to eat meat from animals that have died of the disease," Ukwir advised.

"They should eat meat that has been inspected by the veterinary
department to avoid complications," he added. Ukwir said if no
control measure was put in place, the disease would escalate into an
epidemic and affect the whole country.

Recently Kayunga district imposed a quarantine on cattle movement
following the outbreak of the disease.

Last month [December 2008] alone more than 100 head of cattle died of
the disease in Kayunga. Other districts that have suffered from the
disease are Adjumani and Mbarara.

[Apac district is No 5 and Amuru No 39, Northern Region, on the map
at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda>.
The HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Uganda is available at
<http://healthmap.org/promed/en?v=1.3,32.4,6>.

During 2008, FMD was allegedly reported from Mukono and Kayunga
districts; with Apac and Amurur added, it seems to be widely spread,
covering large parts of the country. However, no official information
has been submitted to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health)
and no details on the FMDV serotypes involved have become available.

According to the data of the World Reference Laboratory (WRL) for FMD
at Pirbright, the disease is endemic in Uganda, with the following
serotypes identified (in brackets, year of last occurrence): O
(2007), A (2002), C (1971), SAT1 (1999), SAT2 (2002), SAT3 (1997;
only in African buffalo).

The WRL further states that "all 3 SAT types are probably endemic in
the African buffalo population."

The last sample submitted from Uganda to the WRL-FMD was derived from
cattle on 24 Apr 2007. The results of the sequencing of this strain,
found to be topotype EA-2, are included in the Molecular Epidemiology
Report of 9 Aug 2007, available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2007/WRLFMD-2007-00021-Uganda-O.pdf>.

Uganda is expected to send its two 6-monthly reports for 2008 to the
OIE, including updated information on its FMD situation.- Mod.AS]
