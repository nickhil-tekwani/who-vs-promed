CDC Reports First Human Anthrax Case Since 1992
-----------------------------------------------
ATLANTA - A North Dakota man who handled anthrax-infected livestock during
an outbreak last year has become the first human case of the illness in the
US in nearly a decade, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
in Atlanta reported Thursday.
The last reported case of cutaneous anthrax in the US occurred in 1992. The
67-year-old North Dakota man is the only person known to have been infected
during a livestock outbreak in the state last year. During the outbreak, 32
farms in North Dakota were quarantined, compared with an average of only 2
farms per year during the preceding 40 years.
The infected man had helped dispose of 5 cows that had died of anthrax 4
days before his symptoms appeared. He wore leather gloves, but the CDC
researchers speculate that the man may have transferred infective anthrax
spores that were on his gloves to broken skin on his face. "(The man)
noticed a small bump on his left check at the angle of his jaw," CDC
researchers write in the 17 Aug 2001 issue of the agency's Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report. The lesion had enlarged to about the size of a
quarter 2 days later and was surrounded by a purple ring, the report
indicates. After antibiotics, the man's condition slowly improved. [14 days
on 500 mg ciprofloxacin twice daily. - Mod.MHJ
"In general, people should minimize the handling of animals that have died
of anthrax. If possible, the animal should be burned where it lies," the
CDC's Dr. David Ashford told Reuters Health. "Anyone that does handle an
animal that has died of anthrax should be on the lookout for any unusual
sores on the skin surfaces that were exposed to the carcass," he added.
However, Ashford stressed that for most people the odds of contracting
anthrax are quite low. "There is no great risk for the public or community
in general," he said. "The risk for those handling these animals is for
cutaneous anthrax exclusively, (and it) is a treatable disease with low
mortality."

[While North Dakota has a regular but erratic pattern of livestock anthrax
outbreaks of usually 2-4 cases, the last human case in the state was in
1978. This patient had the infection "on his left cheek at the angle of his
jaw." Presumably he had nicked himself shaving and then rubbed his face
with a blood-covered leather-gloved hand -- he had worn gloves while
dealing with 5 carcasses on an affected farm. - Mod.MHJ
