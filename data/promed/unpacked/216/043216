Brucellosis revives feedground debate
-----------------------------------------
Some conservationists want some of western Wyoming's state elk feedgrounds
closed, after the discovery of brucellosis in cattle in Sublette, Washakie,
and Teton counties. They say that feedgrounds help spread the disease from
elk to livestock.
A 19-member task force, appointed by Gov. Dave Freudenthal, is studying the
feedground issue, and, could recommend changes later in 2004.
Elk have been known to overrun cattle pasture near feedgrounds. It happened
during the winter of 1995-96, when deep snow forced elk to lower
elevations, including the state's Bench Corral feedground near Boulder.
About 900 elk gathered at the feedground a couple of miles from Ken Fear's
ranch. But, the feedground, which provided the animals with hay and
alfalfa, was designed for just 300 elk. The elk began spilling over into
neighboring pastures, damaging fences and consuming haystacks and crops.
Fear said it got so bad that on some mornings, elk outnumbered cattle 3 to
1. "It was a mess," he said.
Brucellosis was discovered in cattle in the Boulder area in November
[2003]. The disease then turned up in cattle at a Worland sale barn,
prompting the federal government to revoke Wyoming's brucellosis-free
status. Brucellosis was then discovered in Teton County a few weeks ago.
"What's different now than 10 years ago is that we have many more houses on
the landscape, more fences, more people in 5-acre ranchettes. The energy
push is taking up much more habitat. There's the drought that's occurring,
and now, we have a brucellosis outbreak," said Cathy Purves, acting
director of the Wyoming Wildlife Federation. "Looking at the feedground
issue is more critical now than ever, because you've got this combination
of boiling events that has just brought this to the forefront," she said.
But, supporters of feedgrounds say closing them would lead to more, not
fewer, elk intermingling with cattle.
Brucellosis can cause cattle, elk and bison to abort. Biologists say
infection rates for elk can be as much as 5 times higher for elk on
feedgrounds than elk elsewhere.
