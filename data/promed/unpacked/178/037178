New grapevine virus detected in California
------------------------------------------
A grapevine virus recognized in 2012 by Italian researchers, _Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ (GPGV), and associated with disease symptoms in [the grape variety] Pinot gris in Italy since 2003, was recently detected in California.

Agri-Analysis testing service tested 96 randomly selected samples that the lab already had in its possession. 7 vines tested positive for GPGV, including Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Chardonnay from 3 separate vineyards. This is believed to be the 1st reported detection of GPGV in the US.

GPGV has now been reported in symptomatic and asymptomatic wine and table grape varieties in many countries, including: Italy, France, Greece, Turkey, Spain, Portugal, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Macedonia, Ukraine, Romania, China, and Japan. GPGV has been associated with Pinot gris, Gewurztraminer, Pinot blanc, Pinot noir, Tocai Friulano, and Glera, and also Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.

Disease symptoms include chlorotic leaf mottling, leaf stunting, and deformation, delayed vine growth, stunted canes, and reductions in yields. The virus and symptoms can be graft transmitted. Eriophyid mites [see link below] may be vectors of GPGV, but this is not confirmed. There may be symptomatic and asymptomatic GPGV isolates. The effects of GPGV on grapevines are still unknown, in most cases, the virus was reported in multiple virus infections.

University of California Foundation Plant Services (FPS) recently added GPGV to its routine tests. In the Classic Foundation Vineyard, 1760 vines were screened with one positive for GPGV. There was no indication of virus spread.

[_Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ (GPGV; genus _Trichovirus_) is a newly described virus of grapevine, which was identified in Italy on grapevine cv. Pinot gris with symptoms of chlorotic mottling and leaf deformations. It was detected by new large scale sequencing methods ("deep sequencing") in co-infection with several other viruses and viroids. Therefore, it was initially not possible to clearly associate the virus with specific symptoms.

Amongst the grapevine viruses, GPGV appears to be most closely related to _Grapevine berry inner necrosis virus_ (GINV) of the same genus. Trichoviruses are mostly transmitted by grafting material and mechanical means, and GINV is also transmitted by a mite vector. Work is in progress to investigate symptomatology (alone and in co-infections), possible vectors, epidemiology, and impact of GPGV.

Disease management of grapevine viruses and viroids may include phytosanitation, such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of vineyard tools. Use of certified clean planting material (including tissue cultures, rootstocks and scions for grafting) is essential.

This 1st report in the US is likely to be also the 1st report in the Americas overall.
