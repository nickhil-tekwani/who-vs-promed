re: ProMED-mail Post Salmonellosis, serotype Coeln - Norway 20131208.2098566
---------------------------------------------------------------------
In the ProMED posting regarding an outbreak in Norway of salmonellosis with serotype Coeln [archive no. 20131208.2098566], the moderator states, "Outbreaks of salmonellosis in the Scandinavian countries are less common than in the USA, in part due to dietary differences."

We, as representatives of the responsible authorities in Sweden, Norway and Finland, would like to emphasize that this statement is a strong simplification, and probably even wrong, as there are many complex parameters behind how the statistics on salmonellosis outbreaks in Scandinavia compare to the US. In addition, it should be noted that there is a major difference in the way _Salmonella_ has been controlled in Scandinavia vs. other parts of the world, including the USA. For example, in Sweden, salmonellosis been controlled in all parts of the production chain, including feed, since the 1950s. The control programs in Sweden, Norway and Finland have been very successful in reducing infection in both humans and animals, which has been shown in official statistics (1,2) as well as publications estimating unbiased estimates of the salmonellosis incidence in both animals and humans several countries (3-13).

The fact that food producing animals are a major source (including indirect contamination of, for example, vegetables via environmental contamination) has been shown in source attribution studies (14,15) and also by the reduction in number of human cases seen as a result of the successful pre-harvest control of _Salmonella_ in poultry recently implemented in the other EU countries (16,17).

In conclusion, we would argue that pre-harvest control of _Salmonella_ in food producing animals, as well as control of imported food, is the major reason for the low prevalence (in primary production) and incidence (in humans) in Sweden, Norway and Finland -- not dietary differences.
