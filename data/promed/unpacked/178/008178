This refers to comments from the moderator on the article on
Kala-Azar NEPAL that appeared in the Kathmandu Post on April 24 1998.
The last sentence stated that "Although research on kala-azar has not been
carried out in Nepal, epidemiologic studies suggests its presence there".
Kala-Azar is a very well known disease in Nepal and Government is very
aware of that and efforts are being [made to deal with the problem;
diagnosis is made most of the time, on clinical grounds and epidemiological
link, but bone-marrow studies are conducted at district hospital level and
demonstration by microscopy is undertaken for diagnosis also.
Presently, two field operational research on KA are being carried out in
Nepal.
The research being carried out by the Epidemiology and Disease
Control Division of the Department of Health Services/MoH, aims at:
1) Validating DAT for diagnosis of KA;
2) Response of KA cases to first line drug sodium antimony gluconate and
use of a second line drug Amphotericin-B.
3) To assess the comparative advantages of case detection and
treatment plus vector control (indoor residual spraying) over case
detection and treatment only.
The research being carried out by the B.P. Koirala Institute of
Health Sciences (BPKIHS) in Dharan, Sunsari district, aims at:
1) Validating DAT for KA diagnosis;
2) to assess advantage of different vector control interventions in the
form of insecticide treated bed-nets in one village, and indoor residual
spraying in another village against a control village.
Regarding his/her [his questioning of what was the meaning of "Sandflies,
considered weak vectors...", we really do not know what the interviewer was
trying to refer or if he was mis-quoted by the journalist. But if it was in
terms of "transmission potential", this has not been studied in Nepal, and
as far as we know, neither in the [southeast Asia Region.
[Kala-azar was benefited [? from the Malaria Eradication Programme in the
late 50's to early '70's. The discontinuation of the basic strategy
(basically vector control through spraying), as well as reduction in budget
and other constraints, have definitively had an impact on the re-emergence
of the disease and its spread to other previously not affected areas.
