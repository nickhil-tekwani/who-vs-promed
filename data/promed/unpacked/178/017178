[Thanks to Paul Reiter for alerting us to this Sunday Times article which I
have summarized below. I tried, but ultimately failed, to eradicate the
sensational bits. Such is the nature of science in the popular press. Ralph
Blanchfield's strongly opposing view is presented below. - Mod. PC]

The work, by Alan Ebringer, professor of immunology at King's College in
London, suggests that BSE was actually caused by a runaway immune response
to a common soil bacterium called _Acinetobacter calcoaceticus_. It was
published last week by the American Society of Microbiology in its journal,
Infection and Immunity.
If Ebringer's theory is right, it will mean that the multi-billion-pound
cull of British cattle was a huge blunder -- they could simply have been
immunised against the bacterium. This, plus changes in abattoir rules to
stop offal becoming infected with the bacterium, would have halted the
epidemic in its tracks. A second paper, nearing completion, describes how
the same bacterium may be responsible for CJD, the human form of BSE.
Professor Bob Will, appointed by the government to run the national CJD
surveillance unit, has asked Ebringer to analyse blood serum samples taken
from CJD patients. Ebringer studied particular protein sequences in the
_Acinetobacter_ bacterium. These sequences are targeted by antibodies, the
molecules made by the body in response to such invading micro-organisms. He
found, however, that the bacterial proteins were identical to a section of
protein found in bovine brain cells and in the protective myelin sheath
that surrounds them. He believes that, after a cow has repelled an
_Acinetobacter_ invasion, the antibodies carry on working, mistakenly
identifying brain cells as bacteria because of the similar protein
sequences. Ebringer's crucial finding was that most cows with BSE also had
high levels of antibodies capable of attacking both _Acinetobacter_ and
their
own brain cells. Few normal cows had such antibodies.

All of this is old hat. The latest media report, following a similar one in
early November 1999 foreshadowing this publication, seem to be yet further
examples of the publicity hype. At least until recently, it was not
research but conjecture, but widely trumpeted via the media along with
their complaints that "the vested interests of the prion establishment"
were preventing them from getting any funding to do the research.
In May this year, they received a research grant from MAFF [Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries & Food]. Many, including myself, thought that it was
because, in the face of the preceding publicity, MAFF dared not be seen to
leave any avenue unexplored. Although I was (and remain) sceptical about
their conjecture, I said at the time that I was glad that they received the
grant, on the principle of exploring every avenue; others argued that the
substantial funding could have been used to better research purpose.
They purported to know the outcome of their project before having carried
it out. For example a press report of 17 May 1999 included 'Prof Ebringer
said yesterday: "If our theory is right, and we are confident it is...." ';
and Pirt in his letter dated 30 March 1999 wrote 'The autoimmune theory
cannot be overthrown. The prion establishment, of course, is reluctant to
admit the validity of the autoimmune theory. However, we take comfort in the
fact that the truth will out.' .
I have studied the transcript of their evidence to the BSE Inquiry and also
the written Statement that they submitted to the Inquiry dated February 1998
but issued on the BSE Inquiry Web site http://www.bse.org.uk on Day 11, 26
March 1998, as Witness Statement No 16. In it they refer to the 29 cows
mentioned in this paper (see below). Their complaint against the "vested
interests" included a letter by Pirt published in Chemistry and Industry in
October 1998. As one not in any way connected with any research group
having or seeking funding for research on BSE or other TSEs [transmissible
spongiform encephalopathies], and therefore without fear of being labelled
as one of the "vested interests" to which he referred, I responded and a
correspondence extending over several issues ensued. When the Letters Editor
finally closed it (giving Pirt the last word), it continued subsequently in
personal correspondence with Pirt.
Finally I have studied the paper published in 1998 of which Pirt sent me a
copy as recently as 30 March 1999, and which represents what his covering
letter describes as "a review of our findings". It contained no actual
research results and I must suppose it represented their thinking that
would have been the basis of their grant application. The paper that Pirt
sent me in March was Ebringer A, Pirt J, Wilson C, Thorpe C, Tiwana C,
Cunningham P and Ettelaie C (1998). " Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy:
Comparison between the 'Prion' Hypothesis and the Autoimmune Theory",
Journal of Nutritional and Environmental Medicine, Vol 8, 265-276. To be
fair, their paper was actually pp 265-73 and in sending it to me he
included pp274-276, which is a Response (and a pretty devastating 24 point
critique) by Stephen Dealler -- which, however, appears to have been "water
off a duck's back".
I have been sceptical about the validity of the case they put forward;
unimpressed by the way in which they put it forward; and critical of the
way in which they appear to ignore or dismiss established facts and what is
now a huge volume of published research findings with which their
conjecture is incompatible, but which shed light on the nature, behaviour
and near-indestructability of infective prions.
It is true that, so far, no-one has demonstrated the infection of an animal
by purified infectious prion protein "in a test-tube" (one of Pirt's main
arguments); but the ability of the abnormal prion protein to convert normal
cellular prion protein into the infective form has been demonstrated _in
vitro_ by two different methods.
Raymond et al (1997) used the terms PrP-sen to indicate normal protease
sensitive PrP, and PrP-res to indicate the infective, protease-resistant
isoform. They carried out _in vitro_ cell-free conversion reactions with
purified and radio-labelled scrapie and BSE prions and human prions, both
met/met homozygous and val/val homozygous at codon 129. They have shown
that there is a correlation between in vitro conversion efficiencies and
known transmissibilities of BSE, sheep scrapie and nvCJD. [Raymond G J et
al (1997) "Molecular assessment of the potential transmissibilities of BSE
and scrapie to humans", Nature, 388, 17 July 1997, 285-288].
Collinge's group [Jackson et al (1999)] have demonstrated the _in vitro_
conversion of normal cellular prion protein (PrPc) to the infective form.
They synthesised a section of human prion protein from the amino acids in
positions 91 to 231 (PrP91-231) and showed it to be predominantly an
alpha-helical. It contains a single disulphide bond. Reduction of the
disulphide bond and lowering the pH to 4.0 resulted in a beta-form
(beta-PrP) which exhibited partial resistance to proteinase K digestion,
characteristic of PrPSc . Treatment of this with a salt concentration
similar to that in brain tissues resulted in formation of fibrillar
structures, closely similar to those isolated from diseased brains.

protein between native and fibrilogenic conformations", Science, 283, 18
March 1999, 935].
