After the city [Ahmedabad] reported the 1st Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus death, of a Bhuj resident at a Paldi hosiptal, local health authorities have put 33 individuals at Aarna Hospital under medical surveillance. They are being administered chemoprophylaxis (medication to prevent disease or infection). Just like Ebola virus, CCHF affects people who come in immediate contact with a patient, relatives and medical staff attending to them.

Since December 2010, there have been 6 CCHF clusters in the state. "The disease is now endemic to the state. It has been reported in Amreli, Sanand, Bhuj and Patan districts," said infectious diseases specialist Dr Atul Patel, who recently presented a research paper on the CCHF scenario in the state.

"We came across 8 patients diagnosed with CCHF during 18 months, from December 2010 to July 2012, including 2 isolated cases and 2 clusters of cases. In July 2013, the CCHF outbreak in Amreli district affected 6 patients of a community, of which 2 died and 4 were stable. That very month, there was an isolated case from Patan district, where the patient succumbed," says Patel. There was also a death reported from Bhuj earlier.

Dr Patel's paper explains how between December 2010 and 2012, out of 8 patients infected, 7 died, while only one survived. Also, of the 7 who died, 4 were medical staff, and 3 were patients from the community. Hospitalization times were between one and 7 days.

The disease spreads through the bite of the _Hyalomma_ tick, which is commonly found in cattle stables and infects humans who are constantly in touch with domesticated animals.

A senior state health official explained how dengue and CCHF have similar symptoms. "In the 1st incident reported from Sanand, the virus killed an ICU doctor and a medical staffer in Ahmedabad, while in the 4th instance in 2012, a resident doctor had succumbed. This way, medical practitioners are at risk," says a senior state health official.

[As noted in comments in ProMED-mail archive no. 20141124.2986269 and in the report above, CCHF has been an ongoing public health problem in Gujarat state over the past 3 years. Studies have shown that there is relatively high antibody prevalence in domestic animals in this area. A published study cited in ProMED-mail archive no. 20140920.2790245 stated: "...This disease is asymptomatic in animals. CCHF was 1st confirmed in a nosocomial outbreak in 2011 in Gujarat State. Another notifiable outbreak occurred in July 2013, in Karyana Village, Amreli district, Gujarat State. Anti-CCHF virus (CCHFV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected in domestic animals from the adjoining villages of the affected area, indicating a considerable amount of positivity in domestic animals. Antibodies were detected in all the 15 districts surveyed; with positivity of 12 per cent, 41 per cent, and 34 per cent in bovines, sheep, and goats, respectively."

As Mod.CP noted (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100810.2732), CCHF virus is tick-borne, and in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

The drug used to treat contacts of the above patient prophylactically is not specified but might be ribavirin. The virus is sensitive in vitro to the antiviral drug ribavirin, and it has been used in the treatment of CCHF patients reportedly with some benefit. Infection and fatalities among medical staff in the hospitals indicate that barrier nursing and personal protection have not been adequate. Usually, humans acquire the infection from the bite of a _Hyalomma_ tick or from direct contact with blood or tissues of infected animals.
