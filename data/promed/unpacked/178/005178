CDC is collaborating with public health officials in several states and the FDA to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Bredeney infections. Preliminary results from this ongoing joint investigation indicate that Trader Joe's Valencia Creamy Salted Peanut Butter made with Sea Salt is a likely source of this outbreak.

A total of 29 ill persons infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Bredeney have been reported from 18 states. This number may change as more cases are confirmed.

Among persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 11 Jun 2012 to 2 Sep 2012. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 year to 77 years, with a median age of 7 years. 76 percent of ill persons are children under 18 years old. 64 percent of ill persons are male. Among 11 ill persons with available information, 4 (36 percent) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

This PFGE pattern has rarely been seen before in PulseNet, and in the past typically caused 5-8 cases per year. Illnesses that occurred after 29 Aug 2012 might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
State public health officials are interviewing ill persons to obtain information regarding foods they might have eaten and other exposures in the week before illness. Preliminary information indicates that Trader Joe's Valencia Creamy Salted Peanut Butter made with Sea Salt is a likely source for the _S._ Bredeney infections. 14 (100 percent) of 14 ill persons interviewed report shopping at Trader Joe's locations across the USA. 12 (86 percent) of 14 ill persons report eating Trader Joe's Valencia Creamy Salted Peanut Butter made with Sea Salt in the week before becoming ill. This peanut butter is sold at Trader Joe's grocery stores nationwide and on the internet. Investigations are ongoing to determine if any other foods sold primarily at Trader Joe's grocery stores are also a source in this outbreak.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods eaten before becoming ill. FDA is continuing to work closely with CDC and state partners during this investigation. CDC will update the public on the progress of this investigation as information becomes available.
