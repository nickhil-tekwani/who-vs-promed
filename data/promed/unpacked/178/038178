[1] Cholera - Congo DR (Katanga Province)
Date: Sun 30 Jun 2013

A cholera epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Katanga province has killed 257 people, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian affairs (OCHA).

More than 11 000 cholera cases have been reported in the province since the beginning of 2013. The outbreak has been concentrated on the main city of Lubumbashi where over 6000 cases have been reported since May 2013.

Aid agencies in the region say the outbreak was due to lack of clean water sources and poor sanitation, especially among the internally displaced population.

OCHA spokesperson in Geneva Jens Larke says humanitarian partners are therefore focusing on water treatment and hygiene information campaigns to stem the spread of the disease. Organizations on the ground estimate that they will need an additional USD 1.9 million to urgently implement water, sanitation, and hygiene projects in local communities. Many of the worst hit areas are also highly insecure and with limited access because of clashes between the Congolese army and the Mai-Mai group "Bakata Katanga," and between the Mai-Mai and various self-defence groups. Katanga has in recent years been a relatively stable province in Congo DR, but due to the proliferation of armed groups, there are now some 350 000 internally displaced people of whom over 43 000 have been displaced in the 1st quarter of 2013 alone.

[2] Diarrhea - Liberia (Montserrado County)
Date: Tue 25 Jun 2013

http://allafrica.com/stories/201306261057.html?viewall=1


Deplorable sanitary condition in Samukai Camp, a former displaced camp in Upper Caldwell Township [outside Monrovia], has left 1 person dead and 2 others affected.

The deceased, believed to be in his 40s, is said to have died recently from a serious 'running stomach' while being rushed to a nearby clinic. Residents of the area told WASH [Water, Sanitation and Hygiene] Reporters & Editors Network of Liberia that 2 others including a 7-year-old child have suffered severe diarrhea for a week now, but were rescued by the nearby clinic, where they got treatment.

It is not clear whether the latest cases are the result of cholera, but residents said the developments have been triggered by a fresh outbreak of a water-borne disease. Other residents have attributed the situation to the lack of toilet facilities in the community.

Samukai Camp used to be an internally displaced camp, where civilians from Monrovia and other parts of Montserrado fled for refuge during the Liberian civil war. Now, it is a residence of over 1800 people including children.

It stated that 1.2 million Liberians use unsanitary or shared latrines; 1.7 million have no latrine at all and defecate in the open like those in Upper Caldwell.

[3] Cholera - India (Uttarakhand State)
Date: Sat 29 Jun 2013

Fears of epidemic in flood-ravaged Uttarakhand were realized as the state reported many cases of cholera. In the aftermath of the devastating floods, the state is continuing to cope with poor sanitation, which, coupled with open defecation and consumption of contaminated food, could have resulted in cholera and diarrhoea, according to experts.

A member of the National Disaster Response Force from Shimoga, Dr Kumar VLS, who has been part of rescue operations in the flood-hit state since 21 Jun 2013, said around 15 cholera cases were reported in Dehradun and Uttarkashi. Some diarrhea cases were also reported. However, medical test report is yet to confirm any significant increase in the number of cholera cases.

In an exclusive chat with Deccan Herald, Dr Kumar, a practicing dental surgeon in Shimoga, said: "With the sole intention of preventing the outbreak of water-borne diseases in the flood-ravaged state, we are purifying water through 2 kinds of mobile water treatment machines. One is attached to a trailer and the other is portable." The team is using 5 such machines in Uttarkashi. 3 of them are portable and 2 are mobile water treatment machines, Dr Kumar said. "They function on 3-way process. The cartridge filter clears particles more than 50 microns, carbon filter removes odor and taste, and ultra violet rays inactivate bacteria and viruses and purify water," Dr Kumar said.

Purified water is being supplied to the tourists who are trapped in Pithoragarh district and Uttarkashi. "We have a team of experts to operate these machines. In this way, we are doing our best to rescue the stranded pilgrims and protect their health," he added.

[4] Cholera - India (Maharashtra State)
Date: Fri 28 Jun 2013

It's just the 1st month of the monsoon and 6 suspected cholera cases have come to light in the city [Mumbai], all of them in this week. While 3 patients were registered in the state-run JJ Hospital, others were admitted to the civic-run Kasturba Hospital. All patients were residents of south Mumbai.

A 55-year-old man was suffering from loose motions and vomiting since Sat 22 Jun 2013. It was only after his condition worsened and he started to feel giddy that he went to JJ Hospital. "My stomach muscles would quiver and ache, but the motions would not stop. Nothing I ate would remain in my stomach. It was only when I was admitted and the doctors administered medicines and saline that I felt better," said the plumber living in Gulalwadi, Bhuleshwar. "I still feel very weak," he added.

JJ Hospital authorities said the man was only 1 of the 3 suspected cholera patients. "They have tested positive for the hanging drop test. Their stool samples have been sent for the ELISA test and reports are awaited. However, 2 of these had already recovered and were discharged," said Dr TP Lahane, dean of JJ Hospital, adding the BMC [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation also known as the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM)] was informed about these patients. "We tried to get the patients shifted to Kasturba Hospital, but we were told that the beds in Kasturba were full. So we kept the patients in isolation here," said Dr Lahane.

However, the BMC denied receiving any notification from JJ Hospital. "None of the 3 cases have tested positive for the ELISA test. These are thus only severe gastroenteritis cases and not cholera cases," said Mangala Gomare, head of BMC's epidemiology cell.

Additional municipal commissioner (health), Manisha Mhaiskar said the 3 patients admitted to Kasturba were from the B, C, and D wards (Sandhurst Road, Kalbadevi, Mohammad Ali Road, and Nana Chowk areas). "The patients are doing fine. Water samples from these areas have already been sent for testing. If the water is found unfit for consumption, then the required measures will be taken by the hydraulic department," she said.

Cholera has never been mentioned in BMC health files as officials say "its mere occurrence could attract international travel sanctions". BMC has refrained from naming it. While New Delhi and Chennai record hundreds of cholera cases every year, BMC records always reflect zero cases.

Experts say water contaminated because of the city's old pipelines-especially in the island city-can be blamed for cholera. "The water pipes are structured in such a way that clean and waste water pipes run side-by-side. They are so old that if rusted, there may be mixing of water. Water is thus not contaminated from the source," said a hydraulic department official.

Within a week, a 3rd case of cholera surfaced in city on Sun 23 Jun 2013. The patient was identified as a 70-year-old female, resident of Yadav Nand Nagar. She was admitted to Maharaja Yeshwantrao Hospital (MYH) on 19 Jun 2013 and the medical investigation confirmed that the patient was suffering from cholera. Though by the time health department got the confirmatory reports, the patient was discharged from the hospital.

District health officer Dr GL Sodhi said, "The patient was admitted in MYH. Test reports confirmed that she was suffering from cholera. We have alerted zonal medical officer of the area to send a team to check the contamination in water source." The team will also provide counselling and guidance and distribute chlorine tablets so that the disease spread can be checked in the area, he added.

[6] Dysentery - India (Orissa State)

http://newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/Dysentery-affects-70/2013/07/01/article1661780.ece

Over 70 persons in Bikrampur village under Khallikote block of Ganjam district are suffering from dysentery for past one week. With the increase of dysentery cases, a team of doctors of Khallikote hospital has been camping in the village and are treating the affected persons. Despite all preventive measures, new cases are reported almost everyday. 2 days ago, a team from MKCG Medical College and Hospital had collected water and blood samples of the patients, but the test reports are yet to be received.

Though the cause of spread of the disease has not been ascertained, doctors suspect use of contaminated water as the reason. While water bodies are being disinfected, doctors are facing problems in treating patients because of lack of infrastructure.

[The cause of this outbreak is unclear and may be a preformed bacterial toxin, a chemical, or infection. A well-defined incubation period and the presence or absence of fever are useful in generating a differential diagnosis.

A major outbreak of water-borne diseases has taken place in Sama area of Vadodara. Nearly 150 people are ill in the area in various residential localities. Water contamination that took place about 10 days ago is believed to be the reason for the outbreak. Residents of the area had complained regarding this to Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) officials.

According to VMC officials, 88 cases of diarrhea and gastroenteritis have been detected in the area during the last 3 days. The localities that have been affected are located between Chanakyapuri crossroads and Narmada branch canal located ahead.

VMC medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said extensive screening of the residents had been done and they had been given chlorine tablets to purify water and oral rehydration solution packets. He added that the water samples collected now were uncontaminated.

Sources said that work on a pipeline was conducted in the area about 10 days ago. Even as this was being done there were heavy rains while the pipeline was still open and this may have contaminated water. Residents had complained of dirty water supply around the same time.
