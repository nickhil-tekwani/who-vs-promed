Canada: First "Autochthonous" Case of West Nile Virus Infection in Ontario
--------------------------------------------------
An elderly person in Ottawa has tested positive for West Nile virus, health
officials said on Fri 8 Aug 2003, the second confirmed case in Canada this
summer.
An investigation is underway to determine where the patient, who is being
treated in hospital, was infected. The only other confirmed case of West
Nile was found in Saskatchewan in July 2003. Another Ontario resident, from
Renfrew County near Ottawa, is believed to have contracted the virus while
visiting the United States in July, but is still deemed a probable case by
Health Canada.
"Although the first case reported in Ontario in late July was acquired
during travel outside the province, this new case underscores more than
ever our need to remain vigilant in using personal protective measures
against this virus," Colin D'Cunha, Ontario's commissioner of public
health, said in a release. John Letherby, a spokesman for the Ontario
Ministry of Health, said that while officials are glad to see the number of
cases this summer is down dramatically compared with 2002, every new
infection is a concern.
There were 416 probable or confirmed cases of West Nile virus in Canada
during 2002. But officials think that was likely just a fraction of the
actual number, since it's believed 80 percent of people who get the virus
have such mild symptoms they aren't even aware they've been infected. Only
Ontario and Quebec recorded cases of the virus, the first year there were
human cases in Canada. There were 20 deaths attributed to West Nile: 18 in
Ontario and 2 in Quebec.
The number of West Nile cases in the United States has tripled since last
week and will likely top 2002's record total, according to American health
officials. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that at
least 182 people in 17 states are infected. At least 5 deaths have been
attributed to the virus so far in 2003. In 2002, 4156 people in the U.S.
caught the virus, and 284 died.
To date, 283 dead birds have tested positive for West Nile virus in Canada,
with Manitoba (93) and Ontario (81) reporting most of the cases. Dead birds
have also tested positive for the virus in Saskatchewan (53), Quebec (33),
Alberta (22), and New Brunswick (one). Saskatchewan confirmed Canada's
first domestic case of West Nile virus in a human this year on 25 Jul 2003,
the first time someone had contracted the virus in the province. Provincial
health officials said the man was from Assiniboia, 130 kilometres southwest
of Regina.

[The totals for Canada for 2003 so far are 8255 birds submitted for
testing, 7595 birds tested, and 283 confirmed West Nile virus-positive. In
addition there were 2249 sightings of dead birds recorded. This represents
an increase of 862 birds tested and 77 more birds confirmed positive since
the last update on Thu 31 Jul 2003. There have been no extensions of range.
2 more equine cases have been confirmed in Alberta, and the number of
positive mosquito pools has increased by 2 (Ontario 1, Alberta 1).
A West Nile virus-positive blood donation has been reported in
Saskatchewan, and an imported human case is suspected in Ontario. The press
report in part [1] indicates that subsequently a non-imported case of human
West Nile virus infection has been confirmed in Ontario. - Mod.CP]
