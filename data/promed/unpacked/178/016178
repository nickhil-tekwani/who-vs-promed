Summary
In Finland, surveillance of potential re-emergence of poliovirus
transmission is mainly based on environmental surveillance, i.e.
search for infectious poliovirus in sewage samples. Since December
2008, 21 genetically highly divergent, neurovirulent vaccine-derived
polioviruses (VDPV) have been isolated from sewage in Tampere,
Finland. While the source of the VDPV is unknown, characteristics of
the viruses resemble those of strains isolated from immunodeficient,
persistently infected persons. No cases of suspected poliomyelitis
have been reported in Finland since 1985.

Introduction
Polioviruses are causative agents of acute paralytic disease,
poliomyelitis (polio). Because of the work of the Global Polio
Eradication Initiative and intensive polio immunisation programmes,
wild polio virus is currently endemic only in 4 countries worldwide:
Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nigeria. While the eradication of
wild poliovirus gets closer, genetically drifted vaccine-derived
polioviruses (VDPV) with regained neurovirulence, have become a new
challenge for the eradication of polio [1-3]. In an individual
vaccinated with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), the 3 vaccine strains
(Sabin strains) infect the intestinal epithelium and replicate in the
gut for a period ranging between several weeks and a couple of
months. During this time, polioviruses undergo rapid genetic changes,
which can result in the reversion of attenuating mutations. Very
rarely, this may result in paralytic disease, the vaccine-associated
paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP), in vaccinees or in their immediate
contacts. In suboptimally immunised populations the emergence of
transmission of neurovirulent circulating vaccine-derived
polioviruses (cVDPV) may occur. Several outbreaks caused by cVDPV
have been documented [3-4]. In most cases, cVDPV have been detected
soon after the onset of the 1st case of paralysis, but genetic
analyses of isolated poliovirus strains have confirmed their silent
circulation for at least one year before detecting the symptomatic
case. Since decades, polio surveillance in Finland has been carried
out mainly through environmental surveillance. Between 1985, when a
nationwide OPV campaign was launched to stop a polio epidemic which
started in late 1984, and 2006 when an OPV-like poliovirus strain was
isolated from sewage in Helsinki, no polioviruses were found in
Finnish sewage. Since 2006, at least one Sabin-like poliovirus has
been isolated from sewage almost every year. In Finland, only the
inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) has been used in vaccination
campaigns, both before and after the 1985 OPV campaign. However, this
is not surprising as a great number of people from OPV-using
countries visit Finland every year. In this study, we describe a more
unexpected finding, namely the recurrent detection of neurovirulent
and highly divergent VDPV strains of all 3 poliovirus serotypes in
Finnish sewage.

Methods
Sewage specimens were collected and analysed according to the
recommendations made by the World Health Organization (WHO) [5-6].
Isolated poliovirus strains were characterised for serotype,
intratype (ITD) and genetic properties as previously described [7].

Results
The 1st 2 highly divergent VDPV strains were isolated from a sewage
specimen collected on 15 Dec 2008 in Tampere. The subsequent,
intensified, weekly sampling revealed an additional 20 poliovirus
strains (serotypes 1-3) in Tampere up to late March 2010 (data
tabulated in the original text).

Five of 7 poliovirus-positive sewage samples contained more than one
serotype, and one specimen even contained several parallel strains
from all 3 serotypes. A poliovirus type 1 strain isolated from a
sample collected on 14 Apr 2009 was shown to be Sabin-like in ITD
assays and was not characterised further. All other poliovirus
strains gave aberrant results in ITD assays and were therefore
subjected to partial genomic sequencing.

Genetic relationships of vaccine-derived polioviruses
The nucleotide sequences encoding the complete viral capsid protein 1
were determined from 21 Finnish poliovirus strains. The strains
shared only 85.4-87.7 percent nucleotide and 92.7-95.7 percent amino
acid identities with the parental Sabin strains of corresponding
serotypes, indicating that poliovirus strains had evolved from OPV
but were highly divergent VDPV. The extent of sequence divergence
suggests that the viruses have been replicated in humans for more
than 10 years. When the viral capsid protein 1 sequences were
compared with all sequences available in the GenBank and in the other
laboratories of the Global Polio Laboratory Network, no close genetic
relatives were found, indicating unique evolution pathways of these
strains. The comparison with past and still existing wild poliovirus
genotypes definitely excluded the wild-type origin of the strains [In
the original text, these data are presented as a phylogenetic tree
depicting the reciprocal genetic relationships of Finnish
vaccine-derived poliovirus strains supplemented with sequences of
wild-type polioviruses of each poliovirus serotype.].

Analysis of the reciprocal genetic relationships of VDPV showed that
distinct strains of poliovirus type 1 and 3, some isolated from
separate sewage samples, were closely related to each other, but none
of the strains were completely identical. Six poliovirus type 2-VDPV
strains segregated into 2 discrete genetic lineages, and
representatives of both lineages were isolated from the same sewage
sample collected on 6 Jul 2009. Analyses of partial 3D polymerase
coding sequences showed that all VDPV have the closest similarity to
poliovirus type 1 Sabin strain in this genomic region, indicating
that type 2 and 3 VDPV had recombinant genomes. Intertypic
recombination of the Sabin strains is a common phenomenon in recipients of OPV.

Loss of attenuation in Finnish vaccine-derived polioviruses
The representative VDPV strains of each of the 3 serotypes were
tested for attenuation or neurovirulence in transgenic mice
expressing the human poliovirus receptor (PVR-Tg 21 mice) [8]. PVR
Tg-21 mice were inoculated intraperitoneally and/or intracerebrally
with either VDPV isolates or Sabin strains. In contrast to Sabin
strains, all tested VDPV induced paralysis or death in at least some
of the inoculated animals. These results indicate that all tested
VDPV have lost the attenuated phenotype that characterises the vaccine strains.

Discussion and conclusion
Highly divergent VDPV of all 3 serotypes were recurrently isolated
from Tampere sewage. The molecular analysis of the viral capsid
protein 1 coding regions revealed that all strains had originated
from an OPV dose given more than 10 years ago.

The source of the VDPV remains unknown, but both epidemiological and
genetic data suggest that they might be originally derived from (a)
chronically infected still unidentified immunodeficient
individual(s). It is well recognised that sometimes, when patients
with hypogammaglobulinaemia are infected either by direct
administration of OPV or as a consequence of contact with someone who
received a dose of OPV, the virus excretion may continue for years or
even for the rest of their lives [1-2,4]. Until now, approximately 40
chronically poliovirus-infected individuals have been confirmed
worldwide [1,4,9]. Two of them have prolonged infection with 2
poliovirus serotypes, while the others are excreting only one
serotype [4,9]. While the VDPV strains of all 3 serotypes detected in
Tampere most likely were originally established in one person, we
cannot exclude the possibility that some of the viruses have spread
to close contacts.

The identification of chronic excretors is of high importance, since
patients with primary immunodeficiencies (i.e., having defects in
antibody production) have increased risk of developing VAPP
(estimated as a 3.000-fold risk) [10]. Since hypogammaglobulinemia
has been reported to occur most often in Caucasians, the problem of
chronic excretors of VDPV is highlighted in Europe and North America
[1]. Furthermore, patients with hypogammaglobulinemia only have a
longer life-expectancy in better resourced countries with a well
developed health system. Persistent excretion of neurovirulent
polioviruses poses a risk for transmission of the virus to
susceptible contacts in the community, in spite of the lack of
reports of paralytic cases among contacts of VDPV excreting
immunodeficient individuals. While there is no medical treatment
capable of interrupting poliovirus excretion, the risk of VAPP in an
immunodeficient patient and his close contacts can be lowered by
booster vaccinations with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV).

Although the loss of attenuation and regaining of neurovirulence were
evident in all VDPV serotypes in transgenic mice, no
poliovirus-induced paralyses have been found in Tampere or elsewhere
in Finland since 1985. The recurrent isolation of neurovirulent,
highly divergent VDPV from Tampere sewage emphasises the importance
of maintaining high polio vaccination coverage, but also highlights
the usefulness and importance of environmental surveillance in
poliovirus control.

[The authors argue that as the eradication of wild poliovirus gets
closer, genetically drifted vaccine-derived polioviruses with
regained neurovirulence, such as those described in the above report,
will become a new challenge for the eradication of poliomyelitis. In
this study they describe the recurrent detection of neurovirulent and
highly divergent vaccine derived poliovirus strains of all 3
poliovirus serotypes in Finnish sewage. Furthermore, all of these
vaccine derived poliovirus strains had lost the attenuated phenotype
that characterises the vaccine strains, as measured in transgenic
mice expressing the human poliovirus receptor. They conclude that
these vaccine-derived poliovirus strains of all 3 serotypes detected
in Tampere most likely were originally established in one person and
that some of the viruses may have spread to close contacts. This
conclusion is based on the observation that the characteristics of
the Tampere viruses resemble those of strains isolated elsewhere from
immunodeficient, persistently infected individuals. It remains
possible, however, that these viruses could have diverse origins. It
is not stated whether any of these neurovirulent variants differ in
any way in their antigenic properties which might promote their
spread in a vaccinated community.

[The above article clearly defines the challenges of circulating
vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV). That being said, in a well
vaccinated population such as seen in Finland, the risk of the cVDPVs
leading to outbreaks of paralytic disease is most likely very low, as
pockets of susceptibles are not commonplace. Unfortunately, cVDPVs
have been associated with outbreaks of paralytic disease in Egypt,
Nigeria, Hispanola, the Philippines, Indonesia, Romania, and
Madagascar (see references below). As the end game of polio
eradication draws near and there are fewer cases of polio caused by
wild poliovirus (WPV), there is a shift in the proportion of
paralytic cases identified that are associated with vaccine derived
polioviruses (VDPVs), and more countries have been identifying
outbreaks associated with the circulation of these VDPVs.
Unfortunately, many countries have seen decreases in their polio
vaccination coverages as they get further and further away from
having identified circulating WPV in their country, and the National
Immunization Days (NIDs), where extensive social mobilization efforts
were conducted leading to high vaccination coverages at the time,
become events of historical significance. This seems to be the
fertile background for the occurrence of outbreaks of paralytic polio
associated with cVDPV's, where there are significant pockets of
inadequately immunized individuals into which these reverted viruses
find environments for significant transmission (see refs 3, 8,10,
11). To further complicate the situation, we have arrived at a time
where we truly live in a global village, and microbial organisms can
(and do) travel from one part of the world, where there may be high
vaccination coverages, to another part of the world, where there are
significant pockets of inadequately immunized individuals, in hours
rather than weeks as in the past. So, while these immune compromised
hosts who are chronic shedders of VDPVs may live for many years, the
viruses they are shedding may enter healthy hosts who are en route
back to areas where vaccination coverages are suboptimal.
