Turkey: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 4
------------------------------------------------
Sequencing of Human Virus
-------------------------
Laboratory tests conducted in Turkey have confirmed detection of the
H5 subtype of avian influenza virus in samples from an additional 2
patients. The patients are residents of Sanliurfa Province, near the
southern border with Syria, and Siirt Province, which is adjacent to
Van in the eastern part of the country. Human cases have now been
reported from nine of the country's 81 provinces.
Both patients are young children, aged 4 and 6 years, and both have a
documented history of direct contact with diseased birds. In
Sanliurfa Province, outbreaks in backyard poultry are now thought to
date back to late November 2005. Altogether, agricultural officials
have confirmed poultry outbreaks in 11 provinces and are
investigating possible outbreaks in an additional 14 provinces across
the country.
Laboratory tests completed today in Turkey have detected the H5 virus
subtype in post-mortem specimens taken from a 12-year-old girl, from
Agri Province, who died 7 Jan 2006. The child was the sibling of 2
other patients who died earlier. Their infection with the H5N1 virus
was subsequently confirmed by a WHO collaborating laboratory in the
United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health is now reporting 18 laboratory-confirmed
cases, of which 3, all from the same family, have been fatal.
Arrangements have been made to send specimens from several patients
to the UK collaborating laboratory for further analysis. Due to
official holidays in Turkey, specimens are not expected to arrive in
the UK before Monday [16 Jan 2006]. The head of the collaborating
laboratory is now in Ankara to support diagnostic work at the
country's national influenza centre. Ways are being sought to
expedite the testing of patient samples. High awareness of the
disease in the Turkish population, combined with almost daily reports
of poultry outbreaks in new areas, has resulted in a large number of
people concerned about exposure and seeking reassurance.
The rapid assessment of patients with a possible exposure history is
providing a unique opportunity to learn more about the disease in
humans. It is also generating data that can be used to assess the
efficacy of antiviral drugs, as most people with an exposure history
or respiratory symptoms are receiving oseltamivir either
prophylactically or very early after the onset of symptoms.
Members of the international teams, in Van Province and Ankara, are
today working with local experts to plan relevant studies. These
studies should deepen understanding of the epidemiology of the
disease, including the possibility that any human-to-human
transmission may have occurred, the vulnerability to infection of
health care workers and other occupationally-exposed groups, and the
possibility that milder forms of the disease might be occurring in
the general population.
All available evidence indicates that no sustained human-to-human
transmission has occurred. As in Asia, contact with infected birds is
the principal source of infection. The risk of infection for
travellers to Turkey is negligible provided direct contact with dead
or diseased domestic and wild birds is avoided.
Gene sequencing information on human viruses
--------------------------------------------
The WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on influenza
at the MRC National Institute for Medical Research in Mill Hill,
London, has today completed genetic and antigenic analyses of viruses
recovered from the 1st two fatal human cases in the Turkish outbreak.
Information provided to WHO indicates that these viruses are very
similar to current avian H5N1 viruses isolated from birds in Turkey.
They are also closely related to viruses isolated from the large
outbreak in migratory birds that occurred at the Qinghai Lake nature
reserve in China, beginning in late April of last year.
These analyses indicate that the Turkish viruses are sensitive to
both classes of antiviral drugs, including oseltamivir and
amantadine. WHO and collaborating experts will review the data on
amantadine sensitivity. Oseltamivir remains the drug of 1st choice
recommended by WHO.
Virus from one of the patients shows mutations at the
receptor-binding site. One of the mutations has been seen previously
in viruses isolated from a small outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003 (2
cases, one of which was fatal) and from the 2005 outbreak in Viet
Nam. Research has indicated that the Hong Kong 2003 viruses bind
preferentially to human cell receptors more so than to avian cell
receptors. Researchers at the Mill Hill laboratory anticipate that
the Turkish virus will also have this characteristic. Interpretation
of the significance of this finding for human health will depend on
clinical and epidemiological data now being gathered in Turkey.
All available evidence indicates that no sustained human-to-human
transmission is occurring in any country experiencing human cases.
The present WHO level of pandemic alert remains at phase 3: human
infections with a new virus subtype are occurring, but the vast
majority of these infections are acquired directly from animals.
