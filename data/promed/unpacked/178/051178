A 6th Wisconsin horse has tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV). On 16 Sep 2016, the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported that an unvaccinated Belgian filly from Clark County had tested positive for WNV.

"The filly had trouble standing on 10 Sep 2016 and was tested and treated on that day," the EDCC said. At last report the filly was recovering."

Of the state's 6 equine WNV cases confirmed in 2016, 4 have been in Clark County.

West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent

Horse owners should consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

Although West Nile virus has not been detected in mosquitoes in Malheur County [Oregon], 2 horses have tested positive with the virus, according to a release from the Oregon Health Authority.

One of the horses is near Vale and other one is near Rome, said Gary Page, manager of the county Vector Control District.

The district has stopped trapping for mosquitoes this season [2016], Page said, but district staff did not trap any mosquitoes in Malheur County that tested positive for West Nile over the whole summer.

Mosquito numbers were generally low this year [2016], Page said, including the _Culex_ mosquitoes, which are the main carriers of the West Nile virus. "We're not sure why that is," Page said. There have been pockets with high populations of mosquitoes around the county, including the Arock area, he said. But numbers in traps have been lower. Page said that the number of mosquitoes trapped in past years used to be in the high hundreds or more than 1000. This year there may have been 20 mosquitoes trapped, he said.

Owners of horses in Malheur County are urged by health officials to have their horses vaccinated, which takes 2 doses to be followed up by an annual booster.

Horses with the virus may show signs of lethargy, lack of coordination, confusion, stiffness, weakness and, sometimes, fever, according to the Health Authority.

West Nile Virus is transmitted through mosquitoes. It is preventable by a vaccine, usually given in combination with the vaccine against Eastern equine encephalitis virus, which is also transmitted by mosquitoes.
