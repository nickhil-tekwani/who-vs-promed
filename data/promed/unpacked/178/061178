Cryphonectria parasitica found in Bavaria
-----------------------------------------
In June 2016, _Cryphonectria parasitica_ (EPPO A2 List) was found on _Castanea sativa_ (sweet chestnut) in Bavaria, Germany. Before this finding, the fungus was known to occur in Germany only in parts of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.

The infection was detected on 2 trees growing in a forest during a research project on sweet chestnuts, and then notified to the plant protection service. The 2 infected trees were destroyed in November 2016 and the forestry district concerned was informed. No further phytosanitary measures are taken due to the presence of the fungus in the Southwestern parts of Germany where sweet chestnut trees are grown in significant numbers.

[Chestnut blight (CB) is caused by the fungus _Cryphonectria parasitica_. It affects chestnut (_Castanea_ spp.) and some other tree genera (for example oaks, maples and eucalypts), but not horse chestnuts (_Aesculus_ spp.). Susceptibility varies between species. Most susceptible are the European chestnut (_C. sativa_), which is most often used for commercial chestnut crops, and the American chestnut (_C. dentata_). In the late 1800s, the disease spread from the Far East, where native species show very low susceptibility, to North America, where it caused massive extinctions. In the 1930s, it spread to Europe and more recently it was also detected in Australia (ProMED-mail post 20100915.3350).

Virulent and hypovirulent forms of the pathogen exist. Virulent strains induce variable symptoms, which may include necrosis and cracking of the bark (cankers), orange to beige fungal growth, distortion of bark due to the destruction of the underlying tissues, yellowing of leaves, wilting of shoots and dieback of branches. Symptoms progress quickly and death of the tree occurs due to girdling by cankers. Hypovirulent strains cause mild and/or transient symptoms which do not normally kill the host. The fungus enters through wounds and survives as a non-lethal parasite on a number of tree species. It is spread mainly by infected plant and other materials, mechanical means (including insect activity, cutting tools and machinery, birds over long distances), wind and splashing rain.

Hypovirulence is due to infection of the fungus by _Cryphonectria hypovirus 1-EP713_ (CHV1-EP713; type species of genus _Hypovirus_). The virus can be transmitted through hyphal anastomosis converting the recipient fungal strain to the hypovirulent phenotype. However, transmission is limited by a vegetative incompatibility system in the fungus. In continental Europe, the disease has lost its severity due to the natural spread of the hypovirus, which has enabled re-growth of chestnuts in many affected regions. Hypovirulence provides the basis for disease management, and research is in progress on virus diversity, dispersal and the establishment of hypovirulence.

A current outbreak is also reported from the UK (ProMED-mail post 20170206.4817724 and link below) where CB was not detected until 2012 (ProMED-mail post 20120322.1077286).
