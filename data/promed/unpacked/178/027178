[Hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) is a major disease of cattle and buffaloes occurring as catastrophic epizootics in many Asian and African countries, resulting in high mortality and morbidity. The disease has been recorded in wild mammals in several Asian and European countries. In many Asian countries, disease outbreaks mostly occur during the climatic conditions typical of monsoon (high humidity and high temperatures).

The disease is caused by _Pasteurella multocida_, a Gram-negative coccobacillus residing mostly as a commensal in the nasopharynx of animals. The Asian serotype B:2 and the African serotype E:2 (Carter-Heddleston system), corresponding to 6:B and 6:E (Namioka-Carter system), are mainly responsible for the disease.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual, chapter 2.4.12 "Haemorrhagic septicaemia" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.12_HAEMORRHAGIC_SEPTICAEMIA.pdf (NB: version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2012).

Although there are no reports of human infection with _P. multocida_ serotypes B:2 and E:2, other serotypes of this organism do infect humans, and precautions should be taken to avoid exposure (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/hemorrhagic_septicemia.pdf).

In June 2015, Kazakhstan reported an event of hemorrhagic septicemia involving 4 outbreaks in wild animals (see ProMED-mail post 20150606.3415543). The affected species was Saiga antelope (_Saiga tatarica_); 134 252 animals died. The outbreaks were located in the provinces of Aktyubinsk, Kustanay, and Tselinograd. Based on the most recent published information (see posting 20160420.4172382) "several laboratories have identified the bacterium _Pasteurella multocida_ as the causative agent of haemorrhagic septicaemia, which led to the death of the animals. Recently, histopathology has confirmed this diagnosis." (http://www.saiga-conservation.com/news_article/items/saiga-die-off-update.html). - Mod.CRD
