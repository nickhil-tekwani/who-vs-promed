Prevention is the best policy
-----------------------------
Cattle farmers are in distress over the rapid spread of foot-and-mouth
disease [FMD], which 1st appeared in North Gyeongsang last month and
has now reached Paju, Gyeonggi.

Health officials in Gangwon [9], South Jeolla [13] and North [10] and
South [11] Chungcheong have rolled up their sleeves to curb the spread
of the disease. [These 4 provinces have, so far, not been reported as
infected; the figures in brackets correspond to their respective
numbers in the administrative map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:520px-Provinces_of_South_Korea_Txt.PNG>. -
Mod.AS]

To make matters worse, bitterly cold temperatures have frozen medical
equipment, disinfectants are running out and there is a lack of
manpower to support quarantine activities. If the authorities fail in
their efforts, the situation could soon turn into a national disaster.

FMD has severely damaged our livestock farmers this year. Due to its
rapid spread, a total of 233 724 cows and pigs have been slaughtered
across the country, far exceeding the 160 155 heads of cattle culled
in 2002. And it is still difficult to predict how many more will be
killed.

But using vaccines to protect the cattle is unrealistic because there
are a large number of animals involved.

A bigger problem is that it will take 18 months for Korea to be
recognized as an FMD danger-free country once the current outbreak is
over. During this period, exports of cattle will be strictly
prohibited. There are more than 3 million cows and bulls and almost 10
million pigs in the country. The amount of livestock that has been
slaughtered is still less than 2 percent of the total livestock
population, but nobody knows what might happen if we don't stop the
disease's spread. [South Korea's FMD-susceptible animal populations,
according to OIE figures for 2009, are the following: Cattle -- 3 079
353 head (181 404 establishments); Swine -- 9 584 903 (7962
establishments); Goats -- 266 240 (20 534 establishments); Deer -- 78
853 (6095 establishments. - Mod.AS].

The United Kingdom is a representative case. The dairy industry there
almost collapsed after the country was classified as a high-risk FMD
country [in 2001] despite slaughtering 6 million head of cattle.

There is no other choice but to halt the spread of the disease using
thorough preventive measures. Although health authorities have already
lost our trust, they should make further efforts. As shown already,
one farmer's careless act can end up wreaking havoc on the entire farm
industry.

Citizens should be on high alert when they travel to Southeast Asia --
where FMD is still rampant -- for holiday trips. In addition, they
must pay close attention to sanitization procedures when they bring in
foreign meat.

Building an effective system to avert animal diseases is important.
But every citizen must be ready to take preventive measures because
that's the best policy to get back our image as an FMD-free country as
soon as possible.

FMD spreading faster than expected
----------------------------------
Livestock farms in northern Gyeonggi Province have been put on the
highest alert for FMD, with several pig and cattle farms there falling
victim to the virus over the past 2 days.

After devastating farms in Andong and other cities in North Gyeongsang
Province ["Gyeongsangbuk"; see Number 14 in the administrative map,
URL above] over the past few weeks, the disease has made its way into
the region surrounding Seoul [see comment].

Experts say it is just a matter of time for FMD to spread to the rest
of the country, given that the virus becomes more infectious in cold
weather.

On Wednesday [15 Dec 2010], 2 pig farms in Yangju and Yeoncheon,
Gyeonggi Province ["Gyenonggi-do", Number 8 in the map], were
confirmed to be infected with FMD, forcing the owners to cull a total
of 24 000 pigs. Additionally, a total of 18 000 pigs and cows at 23
farms within a 500-meter [546-yard] radius of the infected farms were
slaughtered and buried.

Later on the same day, a cattle farm in nearby Paju was confirmed
infected with the deadly disease, forcing owners and quarantine
authorities to destroy cows, pigs and other cloven-hoofed animals in
the area [Notified 16 Dec 2010 to the OIE; see commentary]. But FMD
tests on suspected cattle farms in Mungyeong and Yeongdeok in North
Gyeonggsang Province were found negative.

While having set up a quarantine zone around Yangju and Yeoncheon to
disinfect cars and taking other measures to stop the virus from
spreading, the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
is examining the genetic traits of FMD found in Gyeonggi Province to
compare them to those of the virus detected throughout North
Gyeongsang Province.

Minister of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Yoo Jeong-bok
told lawmakers Thursday [16 Dec 2010] that the FMD viruses found both
in Andong and Gyeonggi Province are both O-type. "But after analyzing
their 639 genes, 5 to 6 genes were different between the 2. This means
that FMD virus in Gyeonggi Province can be a different strain from the
one in Andong or the virus has mutated on its way to Gyeonggi. We are
now trying to determine which is the case," Yoo said. [See commentary].

The minister then said the government will set aside additional money
to compensate affected livestock farmers for losses from the slaughter
of their cattle and pigs. "We ask the National Assembly to quickly
pass a revised bill under which those refusing to have their livestock
farms disinfected be subject to up to a year in prison. The government
will also restrict farmers and others dealing with livestock from
traveling overseas," he stressed.

Farms in Andong 1st reported the disease on 29 Nov 2010, about half a
year after the last outbreak in Korea. In 5 days the epidemic spread
to Yecheon, about 21 km [13 miles] southwest of Andong. [See comment
regarding actual time-line of the said event].

A total of 36 [see comment] farms have been confirmed to be infected
with the disease so far, with more than 175 541 livestock slaughtered
as a result, the largest ever. In 2002, a total of 165 555 domestic
animals were destroyed. Those farms are estimated to suffer more than
300 billion won [261.3 million U.S. dollars] in losses.

Korea was declared clear of the disease in September [2010] by the
OIE, but was deprived of the status following the recent outbreak. The
disease affects animals with cloven hooves, such as cows, pigs, sheep,
goats and deer.

[The number of FMD outbreaks in South Korea, as of 16 Dec 2010, is 37,
according to South Korea's follow-up report Number 5, submitted to the
OIE on 16 Dec 2010. The report included a description of the 37th
outbreak, detected on a dairy cattle farm in Bugok-ri, Paju-eup, Paju
city, Gyeonggi-Do. This is the 3rd outbreak in the north-western
province, 20-40 km (12.5-24.9 miles) from the border between south and
north Korea. An interactive map is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9993>.

A previous FMD epizootic, similarly caused by FMDV serotype O virus,
took place in an adjacent region in April-May 2010. The epizootic was
resolved after causing a total of 8 outbreaks; its efficient control
could be partly attributed to the way the 1st case, in Seonwon-myeon,
Ganghwa-gun, Inch'on-Jikhalsi, about 50 km (31 miles) to the east of
the current epizootic, was handled (see archived 20100410.1168):

"A private veterinarian 1st found suspicious cases in the affected
farm and reported them to the local government's veterinary Services
on 8 Apr 2010. The local veterinary services ran the antibody
detection ELISA, but it showed negative results. Since the affected
cattle showed suspected clinical signs, they reported the incident to
the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service (NVRQS) on the
same day. The NVRQS confirmed those cattle were infected with serotype
O of foot and mouth disease virus by RT-PCR tests on 9 Apr 2010.
Various animal health measures have been implemented on that farm
including movement restrictions and disinfection. The stamping-out and
an epidemiological investigation have also been initiated".

Clearly, clinical suspicion of FMD should be followed by immediate
initial control measures even if the early tests are negative. the
measures should be maintained at least until FMD is definitely ruled
out by further laboratory and epidemiological investigations. Such
policy was not applied in Andong on 26 Nov 2010, where -- in spite of
suspected clinical signs in pigs -- a negative penside test led to a
delay of 2 days before re-testing and the eventual application of the
prescribed measures, which started 29 Nov 2010 (see 20101130.4301].

A sample, collected on 8 Apr 2010 from cattle in Inch'on-Jikhalsi, was
sent shortly thereafter to the World FMD Ref Lab, Pirbright. Its
genotyping results are available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2010/WRLFMD-2010-0000H%20O%20South%20Korea%202010.pdf>. The virus, of serotype O, was defined as Topotype SEA, Genotype/strain Mya-98. The most closely related viruses were found to be strains collected in February 2010 from pigs in Hong Kong (number of matching nucleotides 633/639 = 99.06 percent
identity).

It will be interesting to check the identity percentage between the
current strains, collected in the 2 affected Korean provinces and,
reportedly, already genotyped by the national laboratory (NVRQS), and
the one collected 7 months earlier and genotyped by WRLFMD. Such data
may be helpful in elucidating the epidemiology of this major outbreak,
particularly its possible source.

Has there been spread of the virus from Gyeongsangbuk (Northern
Gyeongsang, 14) to Gyenonggi-do (8), or were both provinces infected
from a separate/common source? Could residual infection from the April
epizootic (at 4) be involved? (figures refer to the administrative map
at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:520px-Provinces_of_South_Korea_Txt.PNG>).

Attributing the introduction/spread of FMDV to the "careless act of
one farmer" and to "holiday trips of citizens to Southeast Asia,"
though plausible, is in need of substantiation. There are other
possible routes, particularly when pigs are involved, such as the
(legal or otherwise) imports of contaminated/infected meat, offal or
other animal products and their recycling. Information on the
prevailing policy re treatment of food wastes from airplanes/boats
will be helpful as well. -Mod.AS]
