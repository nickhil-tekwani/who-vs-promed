Highly pathogenic avian influenza (poultry), Japan
------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 9 Nov 2021
Confirmed: 10 Nov 2021
Reported: 10 Nov 2021
Reason for notification: recurrence
Last occurrence: 19 Jun 2021
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus [HPAI]
Serotype: H5N8
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location: Yokote City, Yokote, Akita
Started: 9 Nov 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 143 000 / 2 / 89 / 142 911 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: On 9 Nov 2021, the local veterinary service in Akita Prefecture received a notification from a domestic laying hen farm on an increase in the number of dead birds. The samples were collected from dead birds by the local veterinary service (Livestock Hygiene Service Centre; LHSC) and tested positive for influenza A virus by antigen-capture kits. On 10 Nov [2021], the LHSC conducted RT-PCR and RRT-PCR tests and confirmed that the subtype was H5. On 11 Nov [2021], the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH) conducted the sequencing test and confirmed that the subtype of the virus was H5N8, and causative virus was determined as high pathogenicity avian influenza. Stamping-out policy is applied to the affected farm. Destruction of all the susceptible birds in the affected farm is being implemented. Movement and shipment restrictions are imposed on the farms within a radius of 3 km [1.9 mi] and 3-10 km [1.9-6.2 mi] of the affected farm, respectively.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; traceability; quarantine; screening; stamping out; disinfection; movement control inside the country; ante- and post-mortem inspections

Wild control measures applied: screening

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / Test date / Result
National Institute of Animal Health (national laboratory) / birds / 1 / gene sequencing / 11 Nov 2021 / positive

[As reported in ProMED post 20211112.8699631, an additional HPAI H5 outbreak in poultry was recorded in Japan on 12 Nov 2021, affecting a farm in Izumi City, Kagoshima Prefecture. The distance between Akita (in the Tohoku region of Honshu Island, north Japan) and Kagoshima (on Japan's southern island of Kyushu) is about 1247 kilometers (775 miles). The event in Kagoshima is yet to be officially reported, including the results of a sequencing test identifying the subtype of the HPAI H5 strain reported there.

Both events are suspected to have been caused by the introduction of an H5 virus by migrating birds; this deserves further epidemiological investigations. - Mod.AS
