New Outbreak Confirmed
-----------------------
It is with regret that I have to inform you that Dr Baker has advised
us of a new confirmed case of Reovirus in a Budgerigar Society
member's stud in the Teeside area of North East England.
I would continue to urge caution with the movement of birds at this
time and remind you of the recent guidelines issued at the end of
October.

[On 25 Oct 2003, the Budgerigar Society published "Guidelines for a
managed return for the Budgerigar Fancy". The introduction said:
"There is little doubt that 2003 has been a challenging time for the
Budgerigar Fancy, mainly due to the Budgerigar Virus. During the
early part of the year a few studs were affected and by the Council
meetings in May, it seemed to have disappeared.
Unfortunately, by mid-June, there were a couple of new outbreaks, and
we were under the impression the virus was spreading. At that time we
were only days away from the commencement of the show season, and
important decisions had to be made quickly. The General Council, on a
paper vote, decided to withdraw patronage for the whole show season.
All societies were contacted and were told of the decision.
At the October General Council meetings, following veterinary advice,
we reconsidered the situation. It was agreed to hold firm on the
decision not to award patronage to any shows until the new show
season in 2004. However, as there had been no further newly confirmed
outbreaks since mid-July, it was considered reasonable that the
movement of Budgerigars could take place under carefully considered
guidelines.
At this stage, it has to be recommended that birds are not bought and
sold unless really necessary. If you do need to bring new birds into
your stud, you should consider if it is worth the risk".
The new outbreak underlines the justification of the said
recommendation. The detailed guidelines and background information on
this syndrome, recently suspected to be caused by a reovirus, can be
seen at <http://www.budgerigarsociety.com>. Further data -- and
exclusion of theoretically possible dual infection or a
multi-factorial aetiology of this intriguing syndrome -- will be
helpful. - Mod.AS]
