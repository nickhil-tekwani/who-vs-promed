Hepatitis B and C Virus Infection After Kidney Transplantation Abroad
---------------------------------------------------------------------
SINGAPORE: Approximately 50 per cent of those Singaporeans who went to China
to buy a kidney returned with a [life-threatening infection]. Of the 100
Singaporeans who returned from China with new kidneys since 1986, 42 per
cent also came home with hepatitis C virus infection and 10 per cent with
hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis is more dangerous for transplant
patients than for others because interferon, the drug commonly used to treat
the disease [some forms of hepatitis C], will cause their bodies to reject
the new kidney. So while they might have solved their kidney-failure
problem, they are likely to suffer from liver failure, said Dr A. Vathsala,
Senior Consultant Nephrologist at Singapore General Hospital. They could
have caught hepatitis from the donated organ, tainted blood or from
unsterile equipment at the dialysis centre where they were treated while
waiting for the transplant. Every year, 2 or 3 Singaporean transplant
patients do not even make it home. They die on the operating table in China.
Dr Vathsala said that: "In centres that do transplants for commercial
purposes, safety and screening [may not be adequate]. They are under no
obligation to ensure that the patient does well in the long term."'
In the decade to 1996, before India passed a law forbidding the selling of
organs, 158 Singaporeans returned from India with successful transplants. Of
these, 27 per cent [had acquired] some type of microbial infection. A total
of 5 people returned with human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) infection, 2
had malaria and died from it, and many others had hepatitis. [Furthermore]
people who obtain new organs overseas [are not eligible for] the 50 per cent
government subsidy [to obtain the]immuno-suppressive drugs they will need
for the rest of their lives. These drugs cost about $7000 a year. Patients
turn to other sources for kidney transplants because [in Singapore] there
are more than 600 people on the waiting list and only 60 to 80 of them can
expect to get a transplant each year. The waiting period is getting longer,
from 18 months in 1987 to almost 5 1/2 years today. A total of 6 people die
each year while waiting for a new kidney. This makes some of those on the
waiting list willing to take desperate measures.
But Dr Vathsala said patients with kidney failure should persuade a relative
to donate a kidney rather than buy one abroad. The risk to the donor is
minimal, she said, at less than 0.04 per cent. No one has died in Singapore
from donating a kidney. She admitted that giving a kidney was a sacrifice
and the operation was not painless. But people can easily live with one
kidney. Their remaining kidney will grow at least 30 per cent larger to meet
the demands of the body. She said the idea that a second, or 'spare', kidney
gave a person insurance against kidney failure is a myth, because kidney
failure affects both kidneys simultaneously. A person receiving a kidney
from a living donor has a very high survival rate.
