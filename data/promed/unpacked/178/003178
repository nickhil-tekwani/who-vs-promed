Wild rabbits are believed to have caused an outbreak of _E. coli_ at a
Norfolk Wildlife centre which affected 10 children and two adults.
Veterinarians who investigated the outbreak at Thrigby Hall wildlife
gardens, near Great Yarmouth, believe that rabbits picked up the
potentially fatal bug from cattle dung at a nearby farm. It was then
carried to recreation areas within the gardens where the droppings stuck to
visitors' shoes or clothing. It is not clear whether the rabbits carried
the infection on their fur or whether they ingested dung and left infected
droppings.
4 of those who fell ill needed hospital treatment and one child developed
renal problems. All of them have since recovered. Following the outbreak,
which occurred between July and September, rabbits have been killed and
fencing has been erected at Thrigby Hall. The results of the investigation,
which were published in the Veterinary Report, could lead to new safety
guidelines being introduced at outdoor events if there are any more outbreaks.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(Defra) commended Mr Sims and his staff for acting promptly and responsibly
over the outbreak. She said: "We are continuing to investigate the link
between rabbits and _E. coli_, but we haven't come to any firm conclusions
yet. "We think in this case that the rabbits acted as a vector, moving from
one side of a fence to another and bringing the bug with them." The
spokeswoman added that it was important for people in contact with animals
to take "all reasonable precautions" to prevent fecal contamination.

[I presume this report to relate to _E. coli_ O157 infections. Infant
rabbits can be infected with _E. coli_ O157, and have been used as an
experimental animal model. I am unaware of any prior suggestion that
rabbits may be a source of infection for humans. This article was also
submitted by Robert LaBudde. - Mod.ES
[Transmission to humans of _E. coli_ O157:H7 has been documented to occur
via a number of animals, not only by cattle (directly via contact, by
ingestion of beef, and by contact with excrement, as examples). We and
others have reported transmission to humans in petting zoos. Deer meat has
been reported in the literature as an uncommon source for humans of this
infection. We would be interested in receiving information on documented
transmission from other uncommon animal sources to humans of this organism.
