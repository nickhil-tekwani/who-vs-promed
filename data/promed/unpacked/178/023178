A 27-year-old Belgian tourist coming from Tahiti was diagnosed with a Zika [virus infection], after traveling to Easter Island, where the presence of the disease was detected.

LAN Airlines carried out an operation to avoid the woman infecting other people on the flight that carried her to this island territory.

"She sought medical attention 4 days ago in Tahiti for fever, asthenia, diarrhea, retro-orbital pain, and the diagnosis was infection with Zika virus. Ambulatory treatment was continued. As of today [24 Sep 2014], she continued to be febrile and decided to travel on the LAN flight [to Easter Island]," said the Valparaiso Regional Health Officer, Maria Graciela Astudillo.

"LAN personnel at the Mataveri airport activated the protocol for the presence of a passenger with fever, requesting a medical evaluation on Easter Island. The patient was taken to a the Hanga Roa Hospital for the relevant evaluation," the health official added. The woman is in the Hanga Roa Hospital currently, but her life is not at risk.

Zika virus is transmitted by the same mosquito that transmits dengue [virus], although the health authorities were clear in stating that this [situation] does not constitute a risk for people [on the island].

[Zika virus transmission remains active among the Pacific islands this year (2014). The 7 Mar 2014 edition of The Disease Daily (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140309.2322907) recently published a report on Zika virus, "highlighting current outbreaks on 15 different Polynesian islands including Tahiti and Bora Bora. Most recently, according to local news reports and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, one confirmed and 40 suspected cases of the mosquito-borne virus were detected on Easter Island, also located in the [southeastern Pacific Ocean]. Easter Island, or Isla de Pascua, is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world; the nearest continental point lies in central Chile, more than 2000 miles [3219 km] away."

With the one confirmed and 40 suspected cases earlier this year (2014), presumably there are populations of vector mosquitoes present on Easter Island sufficient to permit ongoing transmission, should a viremic individual come to the island. This explains the concern expressed in the report above. - Mod.TY
