Cholera kills 4, downs 50 in Samar
-------------------------------------
4 people were killed and 50 others were hospitalized during a cholera
outbreak in Northern Samar at the height of typhoon Auring, Health
Undersecretary Ethelyn Nieto said yesterday, 22 Mar 2005.
The victims, mostly children, are residents of 2 barangays, including
Nambutak, in Palapag town.
"The patients have been re-hydrated and given antibiotics. The water has
been chlorinated, and those who were not given (chlorine solution) have
been advised to boil their drinking water," Nieto said. She said the
victims started falling ill on 15 Mar 2005, but the cases peaked 3 days later.
"It was very explosive in nature... But we were able to contain it
immediately," she said.
The residents source their water from deep wells. Laboratory tests on water
samples showed they were contaminated with the _Vibrio cholerae_ bacterium.

[2] Cholera - Myanmar (Rangoon)

People did die in cholera outbreak in Rangoon, said local residents
-----------------------------------------------
Although health authorities recently insisted that no one had died from the
cholera outbreaks in Thinganggyun, North Okkalappa and Hlaing Thaya
Townships in Rangoon, local residents told the Democratic Voice of Burma
(DBV) that at least 2 women had died from the epidemic.
The 2 victims are said to be workers from Hlaing Thaya Township, Industrial
Zone-3, Shwekyaryan, and Yes Clothing Factories, and both of them were
originally from the rural areas.
"There are 152 sufferers of cholera in Hlaing Thaya at the moment. 130
people are being treated in Hlaing Thaya Hospital. 22 people are in Insein
Hospital," said an unnamed local resident who visited the hospitals recently.
The local authorities are telling people not to eat snacks and salads sold
by roadside hawkers, but, to no avail, as they are living a hand to mouth
existence, and they have to keep on selling banned food. At the same time,
people mainly blame the unclean communal water supply for the outbreaks.
The outbreaks in Thainganggyun and Hlaing Thaya are in a critical state,
and the officials from the Health Ministry should handle the cases with
care, commented the resident.
At the same time, there have been reports of deaths in North Okkalapa due
to the cholera outbreak, but a doctor denied them.
"Not really. There must be only one or 2. Those who are not good from the
beginning died, of course. If it is cholera, we do not keep them here. If
it is cholera, we send them to Waybargi," she told DVB.

Outbreak of cholera in Maharashtra districts
-----------------------------------------------
The state government, responding to a cholera and gastroenteritis outbreak
in Pune and Sangli districts, launched an emergency operation to battle and
control the epidemic.
In all, 500 cholera and gastroenteritis patients in Sangli were admitted to
several government and private hospitals for treatment.
The state health authorities have launched a door-to-door awareness
program, educating people in epidemic-affected places on prevention
measures, checking people for jaundice symptoms [there is a concurrent
hepatitis outbreak in the state of Majarashtra - see ProMED-mail posting
Hepatitis - India (Maharashtra): RFI 20050328.0898 - Mod.MPP], and
providing information about medical and water purification centers.

Senegal: cholera cases on rise in pilgrimage town
-----------------------------------------------
Senegalese health authorities are working to contain an outbreak of cholera
in the Senegalese town of Touba, just over a week before it plays host to
an annual Muslim pilgrimage expected to gather together almost 2 million
people.
Officials, since October 2004, have registered 16 deaths and a total 1728
cases in the eastern Diourbel region, where Touba is located, but the
number of cases has risen during the past weeks, said Ousseynou Bah, who
heads the health ministry's epidemiological surveillance division.
Pape Faye, the head of the ministry's medical prevention unit, said that in
March 2005, officials had registered around 30 new cases a day in Touba
itself, which is 200 km east of the capital.
"The increase in the number of cases during the last 2 to 3 weeks is due to
water supply problems in parts of Touba, where some water towers broke
down," he told IRIN.
Senegalese authorities are especially worried about the increase in cases
coming days before hundreds of thousands of members of the Mouride Muslim
brotherhood converge on Touba on 29 Mar 2005 to celebrate Magal.
The celebration, which is a public holiday in 95-percent-Muslim Senegal,
marks the anniversary of the exile to Gabon in the 19th century of the
founder of the brotherhood, Cheikh Amadou Bamba.
Touba's population increases 3-fold during the festivities, as pilgrims
arrive from Senegal, as well as from other African nations and from Europe
and America, said Lamine Diouf, of Hizbut-Tarqiyyah, which organizes the event.
Officials from the departments of health, hygiene and hydraulics have been
called in urgently to deal with the problem before the start of the pilgrimage.
"We are working with the hydraulics ministry to treat the water and with
the energy ministry to reactivate water towers," said Faye. "We have also
reinforced Touba's hygiene brigade in staff and equipment."
Cholera, an acute intestinal infection spread by contaminated water and
food, reached West Africa in 1970 after an absence of more than a century.
It is now endemic in much of the region, notably in Sierra Leone, Burkina
Faso and Cote d'Ivoire.
Last October 2004, the capital Dakar saw its 1st cholera epidemic in 8
years. In just under a month, a total of 861 cases were registered,
including 6 deaths.
