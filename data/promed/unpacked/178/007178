Tests proposed for cattle disease thought eradicated
----------------------------------------------------
A ministry of environment wildlife veterinarian is proposing a lethal
sampling program to determine if anaplasmosis -- a disease once
thought eradicated in Canada -- is resident in Nicola Valley deer.

Dr Helen Schwantje cautioned the plan is in its preliminary stages
and nothing has been approved by government. But she is proposing
ministry staff shoot between 20 and 50 deer from Nicola Valley
ranches so testing for anaplasmosis can be conducted at a ministry of
agriculture laboratory.

The Nicola Valley is 1 of 3 places in Canada where cattle have tested
positive for the disease, initially detected in cattle during a
random survey at Douglas Lake Ranch.

Further investigation found 13 of 5700 animals tested at other
ranches in the valley had the disease.

Until now, anaplasmosis, which is transmitted primarily by ticks, was
thought to be restricted to cattle in warmer climates, including the
US. It can also be transmitted by tainted needles and tools used by
ranchers, but is not otherwise contagious.

According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) anaplasmosis
poses no threat to human health. Animals that test positive often
exhibit no signs of the disease; afflicted cattle are slaughtered and
processed through the regular supply chain.

Still, the concern that the disease has spread to the local deer
population persists. While deer rarely exhibit signs, they could pass
it on to more vulnerable species, such as the California big horn
sheep in the Interior. "We need to know if [it] is out there," said
Schwantje. She also cautioned that the measure needs support from
valley landowners and residents.

A rancher said she is in favor of the sampling program because she
believes anaplasmosis is resident in ticks and deer in Nicola Valley.
If that is proven there is little point to the CFIA continuing its
quarantine and eradication program for anaplasmosis because it will
cycle back and forth between wild and domestic animals.

A program to encourage hunters who kill a deer to submit a blood
sample using a special kit has so far netted just 1 sample.

Schwantje said a live trapping program would be too costly.

Phil Hallinan, past president of the BC Wildlife Federation, said he
is not familiar with the proposal. But based on his respect for
Schwantje's work, he believes the lethal sampling program has value.
"We have to find out," Hallinan said.

[The _Anaplasma_ genus has recently been expanded to include species
transferred from the genus _Ehrlichia_ , now named _Anaplasma
phagocytophilum_ (compiled from species previously known as
_Ehrlichia phagocytophila_, _E. equi_ , and human granulocytic
ehrlichiosis agent), _A. bovis_ (previously _E. bovis_), and _A.
platys_ (previously _E. platys_ ), all of which invade blood cells
other than erythrocytes of their respective mammalian hosts. Bovine
anaplasmosis is of economic significance in the cattle industry.

Clinical bovine anaplasmosis is usually caused by _A. marginale_.
Cattle are also infected with _A. centrale_, which generally results
in mild disease. _A. ovis_ may cause mild to severe disease in sheep,
deer, and goats.

Anaplasmosis is not contagious. Numerous species of tick vectors
(_Boophilus_, _Dermacentor_, _Rhipicephalus_, _Ixodes _, _Hyalomma_,
and _Ornithodoros_) can transmit _Anaplasma_ spp. Not all of these
are likely significant vectors in the field, and it has been shown
that strains of _A. marginale_ also co-evolve with particular tick
strains. _Boophilus_ spp are major vectors in Australia and Africa,
and _Dermacentor_ spp have been incriminated as the main vectors in
the USA. After feeding on an infected animal, intrastadial or
trans-stadial transmission may occur. Transovarial transmission may
also occur, although this is rare, even in the single-host
_Boophilus_ spp . A replicative cycle occurs in the infected tick.
Mechanical transmission via biting dipterans occurs in some regions.
Transplacental transmission has been reported and is usually
associated with acute infection of the dam in the 2nd or 3rd
trimester of gestation. Anaplasmosis may also be spread through the
use of contaminated needles or dehorning or other surgical
instruments.

Hopefully they will collect more than blood from these animals and
will do a through search for ticks. It appears there are a number of
ticks capable of carrying this disease so it would be nice to know
which tick species is the problem. Perhaps then a suitable parasite
program can be developed to help control or eradicate the ticks.
