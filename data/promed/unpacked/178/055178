Cat owners are being warned about a parasite that can be deadly. Just this week, a Springdale [Arkansas] veterinary clinic has seen 3 cases of bobcat fever [_Cytauxzoon felis_], 2 of which have been fatal.

The parasite, known as cytaux, has a number of clinical signs. If not treated quickly, cats can die in just a matter of days. "In cats, there is disease called cytauxzoon. Somewhat of a lay name, I guess is bobcat fever," veterinarian Dr Eric Steinlage said. "(It) can be quite lethal to a very high percentage of cats that get it."

Vets said the disease can be caused by a bite from an infected tick. The parasite got its name from the thinking that a tick would have to bite a bobcat, then bite a domestic cat, but it has recently been discovered that cats are already carriers of the parasite. In Arkansas, cats are more prone to the disease because of the number of ticks in the area.

Clinical signs include poor to no appetite, lethargy, breathing hard and moderate to severe pain.

There is no vaccine for bobcat fever. Vets urge cat owners to use tick prevention, such as flea and tick collar, and to keep cats indoors during tick season. If they happen to go outside, cat owners should check their pets regularly for ticks.

"There [are] probably more tickborne diseases that we don't know about than we do, and in people too," Steinlage said. Dog and cat owners are also cautioned to look out for tick paralysis, which can also be fatal and has been seen locally.

[Although this disease can and does appear anywhere, especially considering our mobile society, it has most frequently been diagnosed in Missouri, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas, Kentucky, Kansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Nebraska, Iowa, and Virginia. There are also reports of Illinois and California having diagnosis of _Cytauxzoon_ spp.

Cytauxzoonosis is an emerging, life-threatening infectious disease of domestic cats (_Felis catus_) caused by the tick-transmitted protozoan parasite _Cytauxzoon felis_. _Cytauxzoon_ spp are apicomplexan parasites within the family Theileriidae along with their closest relatives of _Theileria_ spp. _C. felis_ is transmitted to domestic cats by the lone star tick (_Amblyomma americanum_). The natural host for _C. felis_ is the bobcat (_Lynx rufus_); reservoir hosts of the parasite include bobcats and domestic cats that survive infection.

_C. felis_ is transmitted by the lone star tick, _A. americanum_. Cytauxzoonosis is typically diagnosed during April through September, which correlates with climate-dependent seasonal tick activity. Cats living near heavily wooded, low-density residential areas particularly close to natural or unmanaged habitats where both ticks and bobcats may be in close proximity are at highest risk of infection. In some cases this may include areas designated as parks, or hiking trails. Experimental infections have been induced with parenteral injection of tissue homogenates from acutely infected cats. However, infection was not induced when these tissues were administered intragastrically or when noninfected cats were housed together with infected cats in the absence of arthropod vectors, suggesting that oral and "cat-to-cat" transmission does not occur. One recent study failed to document perinatal transmission of _C. felis_ from 2 chronically infected dams to 14 healthy kittens, suggesting that vertical transmission may not occur commonly, if at all.

Onset of clinical signs for cats infected with _C. felis_ usually occurs 5-14 days (about 10 on average) after infection by tick transmission. Nonspecific signs such as depression, lethargy, and anorexia are the most common presenting problems. Pyrexia and dehydration are the most common findings on physical examination; body temperature, which increases gradually, can be as high as 106 deg F (41 deg C). Other findings include icterus, lymphadenomegaly, and hepatosplenomegaly. In extremis, cats are often hypothermic, dyspneic, and vocalize as if in pain. Without treatment, death typically occurs within 2-3 days after peak in temperature. At necropsy, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, enlarged lymph nodes, and renal edema are usually seen. The lungs show extensive edema and congestion with petechial hemorrhage on serosal surfaces and throughout the interstitium. There is progressive venous distention, especially of the mesenteric and renal veins and the posterior vena cava. Hydropericardium is often seen with petechial hemorrhage of the epicardium.

When 1st described, mortality of _C. felis_ infection was reported to be nearly 100 per cent. A study of _C. felis_ in northwestern Arkansas and northeastern Oklahoma indicated survival of natural infection in 18 cats with and without treatment; these cats seemed "less sick" initially, did not have temperatures greater than 106 deg F (41 deg C), and never became hypothermic. Similar sporadic reports in other areas exist. Some hypotheses for survival in these cats have included the following: 1) an atypical route of infection, 2) innate immunity in certain cats, 3) increased detection of carriers, 4) decreased virulence with strain attenuation or occurrence of a new strain, 5) dose of infectious inoculum, and 6) timing and type of treatment.

The most common abnormalities on the CBC in animals with cytauxzoonosis include leukopenia with toxic neutrophils and thrombocytopenia with a normocytic, normochromic anemia seen at later stages. The most common biochemical abnormalities are hyperbilirubinemia and hypoalbuminemia but may vary depending on organ systems affected by parasitic thrombosis and ischemia with tissue necrosis. Other, less consistently detected abnormalities include increased liver enzyme concentrations and azotemia.

Rapid diagnosis requires microscopic observation of piroplasms or schizonts. Observation of piroplasms on blood smears is variable; they are seen in association with increasing body temperature and typically become apparent approximately 1-3 days before death.

In the absence of these observations, a diagnostic PCR test with greater sensitivity and specificity than microscopy can be done. This test is recommended in suspect cases in which the parasite is not observed, as well as to confirm identification of piroplasms or schizonts.

Historically, attempts to treat cytauxzoonosis with a variety of antiparasitic drugs (parvaquone, buparvaquone, trimethoprim/sulfadiazine, sodium thiacetarsamide) have been met with little success. In one study, 5 of 6 cats and one additional cat were successfully treated with diminazene aceturate (not approved in the USA) and imidocarb dipropionate (2 mg/kg, IM, 2 injections 3-7 days apart), respectively.

The most consistent successful treatment in a large case series resulted in survival of 64 percent of cats given a combination of atovaquone (15 mg/kg, PO, tid for 10 days) and azithromycin (10 mg/kg/day, PO, for 10 days) and supportive care. Atovaquone is a ubiquinone analog that binds cytochrome b. In one study of _C. felis_-infected cats treated with atovaquone and azithromycin, a _C. felis_ cytochrome b subtype (cytb1) was identified that was associated with increased survival in the cats infected with this subtype compared with other subtypes. Future development of a rapid means to identify the cytb1 _C. felis_ subtype in infected cats may help better predict the likelihood of survival with treatment.

Supportive care, including IV fluid therapy and heparin (100-200 U/kg, SC, tid) should be instituted in all cases. Nutritional support via an esophageal or nasoesophageal feeding tube is recommended, which also facilitates administration of oral medications (for example, atovaquone and azithromycin). Oxygen therapy and blood transfusions should be administered when necessary. Anti-inflammatory drugs may be warranted in cases with unrelenting fever; however, the use of NSAIDs is contraindicated in cats with azotemia or dehydration. Once a diagnosis is achieved and treatments have begun, minimal stress and handling are recommended. Recovery, including resolution of fever, is often slow and may take as long as 5-7 days. Cats that survive have a complete clinical recovery, including resolution of hematologic and biochemical abnormalities within 2-3 weeks. Some survivors remain persistently infected with piroplasms and may represent a reservoir of infection. In a recent study, dose-intense diaminazene diaceturate (4 mg/kg/day, IM, for 5 consecutive days) failed to reduce the severity of parasitemia in cats chronically infected with _C. felis_ and resulted in adverse drug reactions.

Routine application of a tick preventive is recommended to prevent cytauxzoonosis; however, disease has occurred in cats despite this treatment. In a recent study, a tick-repellant collar for cats containing imidacloprid 10 per cent/flumethrin 4.5 per cent prevented _A. americanum_ ticks from attaching, feeding, and transmitting _C. felis_ in 10 cats infested with infected ticks after application of the collar. In the same study, ticks attached and fed on 10 of 10 control cats not treated with a collar, and 9 of the 10 control cats were infected with _C. felis_. Exclusion of cats from areas likely to be infested with the tick vector (that is, indoor only) is still considered the best method of prevention.
