Enteric stalks Garulia
-----------------------
More than 700 residents of 6 wards of the Garulia Municipality area in
North 24- Parganas are suffering from enteric diseases. Around 500 people
have already been admitted to 7 hospitals in and around the area, with some
being rushed to hospitals in Barasat and Hooghly district. 7 persons have
been rushed to the ID Hospital in Beliaghata after their condition
deteriorated.
According to information, the trouble started last evening [Sat 23 Apr
2005], after residents of Wards 1, 2, 3 and 4 started arriving at the
Bhatpara state general hospital complaining of acute stomach pain and
nausea. The situation worsened later in the night, after more people
started flocking to the hospital, this time from Wards 6 and 9.
The members of a local club of Garulia, Balak Sangha, were the 1st to come
to the rescue of the patients. Police officers of Noapara PS soon followed
with their vehicles and manpower and started ferrying the patients to the
hospitals, after the club members could not cope with the huge number of
patients. Several members alleged that the acute shortage of ambulances to
send the patients to the hospital posed a major hassle late in the night.
Senior district health officials said that the affected have been admitted
to Bhatpara state general hospital, BN Bose Hospital, Sri Balaram
Sevamandir and Sagar Dutta hospital. Locals said that, although the
situation after the outbreak of the enteric diseases was reported to the
municipality, no doctors from the civic body could be seen around the area
until early today [Sun 24 Apr 2005].
Ms. Dipali Roy, councilor of Ward No. 2, admitted that there were no
doctors of the municipality available to assist the ailing. She said the
matter has already been taken up with the chairperson. "We did inform the
doctors of the municipality, but none of them responded on time. It is
unfortunate. The problem has turned acute today, the day being a Sunday and
a public holiday," said a desperate Ms. Roy, struggling to cope with the
inflow of affected residents.
Mr. Sukhomoy Ghosh, secretary of Balak Sangha, said that the worst affected
areas were Radhanagar, BhimerMore, Dakshinpara and Bansbagan. "We have
tried our best to send the patients to the hospitals," he said.
Residents have alleged that lack of proper maintenance of the underground
sewer lines and water supply pipelines have led to gross contamination of
the water supplied by the municipality. People also demonstrated in front
of Ms. Usha Chowdhury, the chairperson of the municipality, who came to the
area this morning. "We are trying to assess as to how this thing happened.
Water samples have been sent for tests," said Ms. Chowdhury.
The CMOH, North 24-Parganas, Dr. Kusum Kumar Adhikari, after inspecting the
affected areas said that 3 medical camps have been set up in the affected
areas and that senior district health officials would be conducting a
door-to-door survey from tomorrow to assess the condition of the patients.
"We have collected water samples and have already sent them for
examination. The condition of some patients in the Bhatpara state general
hospital is critical and special care is being taken. The deputy CMO(H)-II
will be reaching the area tomorrow with more medical teams. Medical
professionals from the district unit of the Indian Medical Association have
also been pressed into service," said Dr. Adhikari.

[The etiology (or etiologies) of this cluster of cases is not yet reported.
It would not be surprising if there are several pathogens involved here,
some bacterial, some protozoal and some viral. A large-number outbreak in a
localized area, even if occurring in the developed world, can easily
outrace any surge capacity of a health care system. - Mod.LL]. [Given the
sudden onset of huge number of cases, some hyperacute, in a limited area,
I would rather suspect acute toxicity than any infectious etiology.
Probably some industry dumped a poisonous product into the sewers which
leaked into the local water supply. - Mod.JW]
