[2] Ebola in W. Africa: epidemiologic studies
Date: 16 Jul 2015
Source: CIDRAP [edited]

Researchers yesterday [15 Jul 2015] noted funeral-related Ebola risk factors. In studies that shed more light on potential Ebola exposure, almost half of the people sickened with the virus in Sierra Leone had contact with a suspected or confirmed case, with many having attended funerals, and a survey in rural Ghana found that nearly half of the population regularly visits bat caves.

The 2 exposure routes are notable, because bats are thought to be a reservoir for several pathogens that can infect humans, including Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). And funeral rituals in West Africa -- especially touching the bodies of the deceased -- have played a role in the rapid spread of the disease.

The reports appeared yesterday [15 Jul 2015] in 2 different medical journals. The Sierra Leone study by an international team appeared in Clinical Infectious Diseases, and the bat study by a team from Ghana and Germany was published in Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Risks from funeral rituals
---------------------------
In the Sierra Leone study, researchers examined epidemiologic data from Ebola infections in the country that were reported between 23 May 2014, and 31 Jan 2015 to learn more about the demographic patterns of those sickened by the virus and how they were exposed.

They used 2 surveillance sources, Sierra Leone's viral hemorrhagic fever database and the health ministry's situation reports. During the study period, 8056 lab-confirmed Ebola infections were reported.

Exposure data revealed that 47.9 percent of people with confirmed infection had contact with a suspected case or a sick patient, and 25.5 percent had attended a funeral. Of those who attended a funeral, 66.2 percent reported touching the body. Researchers said the findings are useful for crafting prevention strategies.

Funeral rituals in West Africa often involve touching the body, and because virus levels are highest in people with severe infections and in corpses, the practice is thought to have played a major role in fueling the spread of Ebola. Safe burial teams and changes to funeral practices have been a key part of curbing the spread of the virus in affected areas.

The group's analysis also provides a snapshot of the epidemiology of the disease in Sierra Leone: the median age was 28 years, and 51.7 percent of patients were female. Clinically, 90.4 percent reported fever, 88.3 percent reported fatigue, and 87 percent had appetite loss. Other common symptoms were headache, joint pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Ebola incidence was highest in November [2014], at 7.5 per 100 000 population each week, and in January [2015] decreased to 2.1 per 100 000 population.

Frequent bat exposures
-----------------------
To shore up gaps in knowledge about interactions between humans and bats in West Africa, researchers visited 3 rural Ghana communities from 2011 to 2012. They interviewed local leaders, observed activities at local caves, conducted a household survey, and held community focus groups.

Overall, they learned that 46.6 percent of residents regularly visited bat caves, that 37.4 percent had been bitten, scratched, or exposed to bat urine, and that 45.6 percent ate bat meat, most likely from fruit bats.

When comparing people who did and didn't eat bat meat, the team found that men and farmers were more likely to consume bats. They also found that people who were more likely to visit bat caves were older and male.

Some of their observations included a bat-catching activity that was part of one community's festival. Caves were often near water sources and served as spiritual sanctuaries.

Roasted and fried bats were commonly sold in markets, with most of the meat coming from local hunters. Some of it, however, came from other regions of Ghana, and even from Ivory Coast.

Ebola ETU benefits
---------------------
In other research developments, investigators from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and their Liberian counterparts found that admission to Ebola treatment units (ETUs) dramatically improved survival and drove down the number of secondary cases. Their findings, based on an analysis of nine outbreaks in Liberia in 2014, were published in a 14 Jul 2015 early edition of Emerging Infectious Diseases.

They found that the reproduction number dropped 94 percent, from 1.7 to 0.1, after interventions began. When they looked at the impact on secondary infections, they found that they were 90 percent lower for those admitted to an ETU compared to those who died in the community.

The case-fatality rate was 68 percent, and the investigators found that ETU admission halved the deaths. The researchers noted that Ebola activity in Liberia dropped off rapidly when secondary infections declined to 0.1 per case.

Though ETU admission clearly helped curb the disease in Liberia, the authors said the steps communities took to protect themselves probably contributed to some of the decline, although their impact is difficult to measure.

Abstract. [edited]
Background. Sierra Leone has the largest number of Ebola cases ever reported. Trends in laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus infection, symptom presentation and risk factors have not been fully described.
Methods.â€ƒEbola cases during 23 May 2014 through 31 Jan 2015 are presented by geography, demographics and risk factors for all persons who had laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus infection. Ebola virus infection (EVD) was identified by Ebola virus specific RT-PCR-based testing.
Results. During the study period, 8056 people had laboratory-confirmed EVD. The median age of cases was 28 years; 51.7 per cent were female. Common symptoms included 90.4 per cent fever, 88.3 per cent fatigue, 87.0 per cent loss of appetite, 77.9 per cent headache, 73.7 per cent joint pain, 71.2 per cent vomiting, and 70.6 per cent diarrhea. Among confirmed cases, 47.9 per cent reported having had contact with a suspected case or sick person, 25.5 per cent reported having attended a funeral, 66.2 per cent of whom reported touching the body. EVD incidence was highest during November 1-30, 2014, at 7.5 per 100,000 population per week, and decreased to 2.1 per week during January 1-31, 2015. Between 23 May and 30 Aug 2014, 2 districts had the highest incidence of 3.8 and 7.0 per 100 000 population per week which decreased over 97 per cent by 1-31 Jan 2015. In comparison, the districts that include the capital city reported a 10-fold increase in incidence per week during the same time periods. Conclusions. Almost half of EVD cases in Sierra Leone reported physical contact with a person ill with EVD or a dead body, highlighting prevention opportunities.

Abstract [edited]
Because some bats host viruses with zoonotic potential, we investigated human-bat interactions in rural Ghana during 2011-2012. Nearly half (46.6 per cent) of respondents regularly visited bat caves; 37.4 per cent had been bitten, scratched, or exposed to bat urine; and 45.6 per cent ate bat meat. Human-bat interactions in rural Ghana are frequent and diverse.

Abstract [edited]
We measured the reproduction number before and after interventions were implemented to reduce Ebola transmission in 9 outbreaks in Liberia during 2014. We evaluated risk factors for secondary cases and the association between patient admission to an Ebola treatment unit (ETU) and survival. The reproduction number declined 94 per cent from 1.7 (95 per cent CI 1.1-2.6) to 0.1 (95 per cent CI 0.02-0.6) after interventions began. The risk for secondary infections was 90 per cent lower for patients admitted to an ETU (risk ratio 0.1, 95 per cent CI 0.04-0.3) than for those who died in the community. The case-fatality rate was 68 per cent (95 per cent CI 60-74), and ETU admission was associated with a 50 per cent reduction in death (hazard ratio 0.5, 95 per cent CI 0.4-0.8). Isolation and treatment of Ebola patients had the dual benefit of interrupting community transmission and improving survival. - Mod.LK]

15 Jul 2015 Liberia: Re-emergence of Ebola in Liberia remains a mystery
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/07/15/ebola-liberia-epidemic-sierra-leone-guinea/30183429/
[Six cases of Ebola have surfaced in Liberia in the 2 months since the nation was declared free of the deadly virus, raising fears the disease lingers in the human body in ways not fully understood. Three of those cases were in just the past week, doubling the number of new infections since the virus apparently re-emerged in late June [2015], the World Health Organization (WHO) said Wed [15 Jul 2015].
The newest case occurred in a suburb of Monrovia, the capital city devastated at the peak of last fall's epidemic by scores of new Ebola infections each week. This new patient was a nurse who died Sun [12 Jul 2015] on arrival at an Ebola treatment clinic in Monrovia, according to the United Nations and the Liberian government. She had been caring for her son, who became infected with the disease in a remote village and fled to the capital.
Government health officials are ramping up responses in Monrovia, tracking more than 140 people exposed to the virus, including 16 placed under quarantine. "We have asked all county health officers to be on the alert," said Francis Kateh, Liberia's chief medical officer. "We are not saying the other counties have Ebola. But we need to alert them so that we wouldn't experience the previous outbreak." The 6 new infections In Liberia since 21 Jul 2015 include 2 deaths. The disease, meanwhile, persists in neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea, where a few dozen new cases are reported each week, according to the WHO.

The strain that re-surfaced in Liberia does not appear to [be] genetically similar to those in Sierra Leona and Guinea, suggesting the new infections are not the result of cross-border contamination. Instead, the strain in Liberia is similar to one that circulated in that country last year [2014], according to the WHO. "Preliminary evidence from genomic sequencing strongly suggests that the most likely origin of transmission is a re-emergence of the virus from a survivor within Liberia," the WHO reported Wed [14 Jul 2015]. ...more

17 Jul 2015 Liberia: Liberia authorities track herbalist who escaped Ebola quarantine
http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL5N0ZW56U20150716
[According to officials, an herbalist (who treated the index patient of Liberia's latest outbreak of Ebola virus disease) has escaped quarantine and fled to Nimba County. The index patient is a 17-year-old-boy from the village of Nedowian, in Margibi County. Nimba County is in north Liberia, near Guinea. The herbalist is one of 120 people placed under quarantine for coming into contact with the deceased index patient.

According to Paul Karnue, spokesperson for the Nimba local government, "The herbalist evaded quarantine and is on the run; this is a reason we are putting everybody on alert. Nimba County authorities are not taking Ebola's recurrence lightly because the county suffered severely during the 1st outbreak. According to Karnue: "It is worth mentioning that the 1st Ebola case in Nimba County in 2014 started with a similar story. One herbalist went to Monrovia to treat an Ebola patient, where he contracted the virus and returned with it to Nimba. This is how Ebola spread and took away the lives of hundreds of citizens." ]

Research
--------
19 Jul 2015: Key protein pathways critical to Ebola virus can be blocked, according to new study
http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/296939.php
[Scientists started their research efforts with the premise that the virus is essentially nothing without a cell. Using a newly developed statistical algorithm designed especially to prioritize the results of siRNA screens, and further computational analysis, scientists discovered 2 networks of biochemical reactions that seemed particularly critical for the virus to enter the cells - the PI3 kinase (phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor) pathway and the CAMK2(calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II beta - human) pathway. There are drugs currently available to block both pathways, and researchers decided to continue on to see if they would interfere with the Ebola infection of cells. They tested both the virus pseudo-types and the Ebola Zaire virus. Researchers found that virus titers for the real Ebola virus dropped by 65 percent when the PI3 kinase inhibitor was stopped.

WFP is also implementing a mobile cash transfer programme to provide two additional months of support to survivors, to allow them to purchase their own foods in local markets.

18 Jul 2015: USD 3.4 billion was just pledged to prevent another Ebola outbreak -- but it might not be enough
