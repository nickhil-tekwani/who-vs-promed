[With the addition of this newly reported fatality, there have now been 319 deaths reported (out of 753 cases) bringing the case fatality rate to 42.4 percent. Checking previous reports on newly confirmed cases, it appears as though the fatality reported today (29 Sep 2014) had been reported as a confirmed case on 12 Sep 2014 (see MERS-CoV (12): Saudi Arabia 20140912.2770252). At the time of the initial report on this case she had been admitted to the ICU, suggesting a serious clinical picture.

Today's (29 Sep 2014) report of a recovered case involves a healthcare worker who was confirmed as a case of MERS-CoV infection on 29 Aug 2014 (see MERS-CoV (10): Saudi Arabia 20140904.2693605 for more details). At the time of report of confirmed diagnosis, this individual was symptomatic on home isolation, presumably with a mild illness. Given the lengthy duration between time of confirmation and date of recovery, one wonders if the clinical course included a more severe presentation, or if the individual was a prolonged shedder of virus.
