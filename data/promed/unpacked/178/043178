Subject: Third salmonella linked death (Australia)
The Melbourne Age reports (29.3.1997) in an article titled "Third death
heightens food fears" that the Victorian state coroner was investigating
Victoria's third salmonella-linked death this year as health officials
battle to retain public confidence in food hygiene standards.
A 27 year old man who died at his Springvale home on 9 March was found to
have the rare _Salmonella typhimurium 43_ in his body. The cause of his
death is not known.
Six other people have fallen ill with the rare strain, including a woman who
was admitted to hospital, in the state's third salmonella outbreak this year.

Friday 21st March
Two people died and 30 are ill from _Salmonella muenchen_ poisoning after
eating ham and corned beef products from a food processing plant factory in
Reservoir.
Tuesday 25th March
Pork, ham and pate rolls from a bakery in Springvale cause an unprecedented
outbreak of salmonella. By the following weekend, 554 people with
_Salmonella typhimurium_ were linked to the outbreak.
Friday 28th March
One young man dies and it was announced he had the extremely rare
_Salmonella typhimurium 43_, which has made 6 others ill. Health authorities
close an epidemiologically related restuarant in Springvale.
*Postscript :In the last two days it has been stated in the media that a
popular liver paste and another product are now under recall from Victoria,
Australia (a brand also sold in Western Australia imported from Victoria).
WA health officials have found contamination of some type in the eastern
state small goods. Further details should be available soon. An appeal for
increased food monitoring standards has also been heard through the media
and sales of smallgoods in Victoria's markets have declined as the public
become wary of eating possibly contaminated processed meats.
