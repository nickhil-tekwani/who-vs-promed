For more than 60 years, the possible causes of chestnut mosaic remained unclear. Since the 1980s, this disease has been observed in sweet chestnut [_Castanea sativa_] commercial orchards in France and Italy. There are also records from Hungary and Japan.

Past studies had shown that the disease is graft-transmissible, eliminated by thermotherapy and transmitted by aphids. Recent studies (sequencing, phylogenetic analyses) have demonstrated that a novel badnavirus tentatively called Chestnut mosaic virus (ChMV) is associated with this disease. Koch's postulates were not fully verified, but available evidence [see comment below] strongly suggests that ChMV is the causal agent.

The low diversity of ChMV isolates from France and Italy indicates that the virus is a recent introduction in Europe.

[Currently there are more than 60 species classified within the genus _Badnavirus_ (family Caulimoviridae), including the cocoa swollen shoot viruses (see previous ProMED posts in the archives), _Banana streak virus_, as well as several species affecting yams and sugar cane. The viruses are spread by various species of mealybugs (family Pseudococcidae) and, depending on the crop, may also be transmitted by grafting or mechanical inoculation or with infected plant material (suckers, tissue cultures). Transmission with pollen and via true seed is considered unlikely. Disease management for commercial crops relies mainly on phytosanitation and clean planting material. Mealybugs are difficult to control; vector and/or virus reservoirs may be extensive. Breeding programmes for virus- or vector-resistant varieties exist for some affected crops.

Additional information from the source paper clarifies the 'available evidence' for an involvement of the novel virus in chestnut mosaic as detection of ChMV in symptomatic graft-inoculated indicator plants (_Castanea_ and _Quercus_ species) as well as in chestnut trees presenting typical ChMD symptoms in the field (100 and 87% in France and Italy, respectively). Publicly available data also allowed reconstruction of ChMV sequences from _C. mollissima_ and _C. dentata_ from the US. Preliminary epidemiological studies in France and central eastern Italy showed that ChMV has a high incidence in some commercial orchards and low within-orchard genetic diversity.
