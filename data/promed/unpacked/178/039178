The damage caused by African swine fever [ASF] in [Belgium] amounts to 22.5 million euros [about USD 24.8 million] per month, reports 'Nieuwe Oogst'. The Federation of Belgian Meat (FEBEV) calculated the total losses to be at least 700 million euros [nearly USD 771.6 million]. "Past crises teach us that it can take up to 10 years for the image to return to the old level," says Michael Gore from FEBEV. "We will still have problems with this in the coming years."

In 2018, wild boar were found infected by ASF in the province of Luxembourg. This was followed by 25 countries deciding to close their borders for Belgian pork. Meanwhile, India, Viet Nam, and Singapore have re-opened their gates. Negotiations are still in full swing with China. Some important steps were taken during the economic mission that took place this week.

Exports to European countries could continue, albeit at lower prices than, say, Dutch or German pork. The frustration among Belgian pig farmers is great. "Less than 2 per cent of the pigs are in the affected province of Luxembourg," Michael Gore tells Nieuwe Oogst. "Nevertheless, the entire Belgian sector is suffering the consequences."

Belgium can resume exports on condition that no new ASF cases of swine fever are found for a year. But at the end of October [2019], another carcass of a boar was discovered that was contaminated. "There is a debate about whether to count from the date this animal died or from the date of its carcass being found," says Gore. "We assume that the last ASF case took place in August [2019; see comment below]. In the best scenario, we can resume exports in August 2020."

The price that our pig farmers receive is currently 6 cents [USD 7 cents] per kilo lower than in the Netherlands and Germany. According to Boerenbond [Flemish Farmers Union], the ASF is fully responsible for that price difference. As a result, a pig farm loses about 35 000 euros [about USD 38 584] in income per year relative to its Dutch colleagues.

[The dead boar found within the infected zone in Luxembourg province on 7 Nov 2019, mentioned above, was confirmed by real-time PCR on 13 Nov 2019. The case was reported to the OIE in Belgium's follow-up report no 49, submitted 18 Nov 2019. The report included the following text under "Affected population":

"The finding concerns the remains (only bones) of a wild boar that has been dead for more than 6 months, so the death occurred before May 2019. The bones are dry and completely fleshless. The internal control qPCR beta actin performed twice by the National Reference Laboratory was negative. On the basis of the literature, the impossibility of demonstrating in the laboratory the presence of a remnant of the wild boar's DNA (negative beta-actin) in a bone found in the open air indicates that more than 6 months have elapsed since the death of the animal (cf. Article "Porcine bone samples left in open-air" - Biomedical Reports)."

The follow-up report, with a map, is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=32405.

The most recent "fresh" ASF case involved a wild boar killed in Saint-Leger, Luxembourg, on 11 Aug 2019 (follow-up report 46, submitted 19 Aug 2019, available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=31452).

Belgium's ASF event in wild boars started 9 Sep 2018. Its OIE summary, as of 13 Nov 2019, follows:
Total outbreaks = 664 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Wild boar / not available / 829 / 803 / 26 / 0

The province affected is located within Belgium's French-speaking autonomous region, Wallonia, in the southern part of the country. More than 90% of Belgium's pig industry is located in Dutch-speaking Flanders; map at https://www.freeworldmaps.net/europe/belgium/political.html. - Mod.AS
