Consumers told not to eat pasta possibly contaminated with dangerous
bacteria
-----------------------------------
OTTAWA (CP) -- The Canadian Food Inspection Agency warned the public
early Saturday that some kinds of pasta products bought at Costco
stores may contain dangerous bacteria and shouldn't be eaten.
There have been several reported illnesses possibly linked to these
products, the agency said in a release.
Costco Wholesale Canada Ltd. has voluntarily recalled Kirkland
Signature brand Cheese Cannelloni and Meat Lasagna because they may be
contaminated with Staphylococcus bacteria.
The affected products, with best-before dates up to and including
Sept. 25, 2001, are Cheese Cannelloni, Item No. 2793; Cheese
Cannelloni, Item No. 19654; Meat Lasagna, Item No. 2792; Meat Lasagna,
Item No. 19363.
These products were sold in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick.
Food contaminated with Staphylococcus bacteria may not look or smell
spoiled, and the toxin produced by the bacteria is not easily
destroyed at normal cooking temperatures.
Consumers should dispose of remaining product immediately, or return
it to a Costco Wholesale warehouse for a full refund.
Common symptoms of Staphylococcus poisoning are nausea, vomiting,
abdominal cramping and fever. In severe cases, headache, muscle
cramping and changes in blood pressure and pulse rate may occur.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is continuing with the
investigation and is monitoring the effectiveness of the recall.
For more information, call Costco Wholesale Canada Ltd. at
613-221-2011 or
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency at 1-800-561-3350 in Quebec and
1-800-442-2342 in other provinces and territories.
