To date 3 districts in the central province of Nghe An have reported that some 383 pigs have died of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection, also called blue ear disease.

The disease has already wiped out herds in Dien Kim and Dien Thai Communes of Dien Chau District; Quynh Thach, Quynh Van, and Quynh Xuan Communes in Quynh Luu District; and 5 communes in Yen Thanh District.

This rapid spread of the disease is worrying local authorities and causing much concern among breeders.

On 19 Mar 2013, Dinh Viet Hong, deputy chairman of Nghe An People's Committee, [met] with animal health authorities in Dien Chau District, which reported fresh outbreaks. Since 16 Mar 2013, 2 outbreaks killed 70 pigs in Dien Kim and Dien Thai Communes. Hong asked the provincial Department of Animal Health to provide Dien Chau District with 5 million vaccine dozes and 500 000 liters of chemicals for blue ear prevention.

[Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is characterised by reproductive failure of sows and respiratory problems of piglets and growing pigs. The disease is caused by the PRRS virus, a virus currently classified as a member of the order _Nidovirales_, family _Arteriviridae_, genus _Arterivirus_. The primary target cell of the virus is the alveolar macrophage of the pig. 2 major antigenic types of the virus exist, type 1 (European) and type 2 (American). The virus is primarily transmitted via infected pigs but also by faeces, urine, semen, and fomites.

PRRS occurs in most major pig-producing areas throughout the world. The reproductive failure is characterised by infertility, late fetal mummification, abortions, stillbirths, and the birth of weak piglets that often die soon after birth from respiratory disease and secondary infections. Older pigs may demonstrate mild signs of respiratory disease, usually complicated by secondary infections. No other species are known to be naturally infected with PRRSV.

Differences in virulence between PRRSV isolates within a genotype and between genotypes are believed to exist based on field observations and some experimental studies. This variability has been reinforced with the emergence in 2006 of a PRRSV lineage in Southeast Asia, including Viet Nam, associated with porcine high fever disease, a syndrome causing high mortality in all ages of swine.

The disease was declared by Viet Nam as enzootic in May 2008; no immediate notifications to the OIE are required. It is not zoonotic.

According to Viet Nam's 2 semi-annual reports to the OIE during 2012, 363 PRRS outbreaks were recorded. "Ring vaccinations" (116 000) were reported only for the 2nd half of the year. In 2011, the annual number of "ring vaccinations" was 18 300. - Mod.AS
