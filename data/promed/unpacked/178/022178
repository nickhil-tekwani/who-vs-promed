[1] WHO Ebola Situation Report - 16 Dec 2015 [as of 13 Dec 2015]

Date: 16 Dec 2015

SUMMARY
No confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in the week to 13 Dec 2015. All contacts associated with the cluster of 3 confirmed cases of EVD reported from Liberia in the week to 22 Nov have now completed 21-day follow-up. The 1st-reported case in the cluster, a 15-year-old boy, died on 23 Nov [2015]; 2 subsequent cases, the boy's father and younger brother, tested negative twice for Ebola virus on 3 Dec 2015 and were discharged. As of 11 Dec 2015, 210 eligible recipients associated with the cluster had received the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine as part of the Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia (PREVAIL study), which is administered by the Government of Liberia and the US National Institutes of Health.

Liberia
----
Human-to-human transmission linked to the recent cluster of cases in Liberia will end on 14 Jan 2016, 42 days after the 2 most recent cases received a 2nd consecutive negative test for Ebola virus, if no further cases are reported.

Guinea
----
Human-to-human transmission linked to the primary outbreak in Guinea will end on 28 Dec 2015, 42 days after the country's most recent case, reported on 29 Oct 2015, received a 2nd consecutive negative test for Ebola virus.

Sierra Leone
----
Human-to-human transmission linked to the primary outbreak was declared to have ended on 7 Nov 2015. The country has now entered a 90-day period of enhanced surveillance scheduled to conclude on 5 Feb 2016.

The recent cluster of cases in Liberia is now understood to have been a result of the re-emergence of Ebola virus that had persisted in a previously infected individual. Although the probability of such re-emergence events is low, the risk of further transmission following a re-emergence underscores the importance of implementing a comprehensive package of services for survivors that includes the testing of appropriate bodily fluids for the presence of Ebola virus RNA. The governments of Liberia and Sierra Leone, with support from partners including WHO and US CDC, have implemented voluntary semen screening and counselling programmes for male survivors in order to help affected individuals understand their risk and take necessary precautions to protect close contacts. A network of clinical services for survivors is also being expanded in Liberia and Sierra Leone, with plans for comprehensive national policies for the care of EVD survivors due to be completed in January 2016.

In order to effectively manage and respond to the consequences of residual Ebola risks, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have each put surveillance systems in place to enable health workers and members of the public to report any case of illness or death that they suspect may be related to EVD to the relevant authorities.

In the week to 13 Dec 2015, 1014 community death alerts were reported in Guinea from all of the country's 34 prefectures. Over the same period 8 operational laboratories in Guinea tested a total of 593 new and repeat samples from 12 of the country's 34 prefectures.

In Liberia, 1027 alerts were received from all 15 of the country's Counties. The country's 5 operational laboratories tested 1277 samples for EVD over the same period.

In Sierra Leone, 1446 alerts were reported from all of the country's 14 districts in the week ending 29 Nov 2015 (the most recent week for which data are available). 1151 samples were tested for EVD by the country's 8 operational laboratories in the week ending 13 Dec 2015.

The deployment of rapid-response teams following the detection of a new confirmed case continues to be a cornerstone of the national response strategy in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Each country has at least 1 national rapid-response team, with strengthening of national and subnational rapid-response capacity and validation of incident-response plans continuing through December 2015 and January 2016.

Figure 1: Confirmed, probable, and suspected EVD cases worldwide shows a total of 28 640 cases, including 36 in 7 countries outside the 3 epidemic countries.

Hence Table 1: Confirmed, probable, and suspected EVD cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone shows the total for the 3 countries to be 21 604.
But take note of the footnote to that table:

"Data are based on official information reported by ministries of health. These numbers are subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation and availability of laboratory results.
[each caveat listed below refers to a symbol in the table]
- Not reported due to the high proportion of probable and suspected cases that are reclassified.
- Data not available.
- Cases reported before 9 May 2015 are shaded blue. Due to ongoing surveillance and retrospective validation of cases and deaths, these totals may be subject to revision.
- Sierra Leone was declared free of Ebola virus transmission in the human population on 7 Nov 2015, and has now entered a 90-day period of heightened surveillance."

15 Dec 2015 UN: Special envoy on Ebola speaks with United Nations at press conference
http://bioprepwatch.com/stories/510652919-special-envoy-on-ebola-speaks-with-united-nations-at-press-conference
[Dr. David Nabarro, the United Nations special envoy on Ebola, spoke with the United Nations (UN) News Center in a recent press conference regarding the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa. Dr. Nabarro stated the priorities for addressing an outbreak response will be to ensure the EVD survivors are able to obtain needed medical help. He also pointed out the Zaire ebolavirus can live on in certain body fluids after otherwise testing free of EVD, As an example, Dr. Nabarro said these virus remnants can spread through sexual contact, and survivors and health-care providers will need to take special precautions when needed. He also spoke of the need for continued vigilance in the event an EVD flare-up occurs, and said the medical and other services in affected countries will need to be brought back to capacity in order to serve recovery efforts.

The UN also reports the Office of the Special Envoy on Ebola will close at the end of [2015]. Despite this, Dr. Nabarro states the UN presence will still be in place during the remainder of the outbreak. "I will personally stay continuously engaged in the issue, working with the World Health Organization, working with governments, working with partners to try to keep a close eye on what is happening and to ensure that the whole UN system continues to be fully engaged with the affected countries," Nabarro said.]

15 Dec 2015 Uganda: Health Ministry Rules Out Ebola in Mubende
http://allafrica.com/stories/201512151125.html
[Blood samples drawn from 2 patients admitted to Mubende Regional Referral Hospital with a strange illness last week have tested negative for all contagious heamorrhagic fevers (HF). According to the Director General Health services, Dr Jane Aceng, the blood samples were tested at the Uganda Virus Research Institute and they all tested negative for strains of Ebola, yellow fever and Marburg. "Results returned negative for all hemorrhagic fevers [but see below] and we are still running other tests to establish the cause of the illness," Dr Aceng told Daily Monitor."]
[Not yet ruled out are Lassa fever, Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), severe malaria, dengue HF, typhoid. Mubende town is located approximately 172 km (107 mi), by road, west of Kampala, the capital of Uganda. - Mod.JW]

15 Dec 2015 Guinea: Disbelief about Ebola continues 2 years after the beginning of the epidemic
https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/story-guinea-disbelief-around-ebola-as-stubborn-as-the-virus-itself
[Inside (a house), a woman lay in bed with a fever, suffering from abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting -- all possible signs of Ebola. Dr. Ahmed and the team tried to convince the family to let them take her to the nearest Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) to be tested, but they refused, leaving them with no choice but to turn around and leave the patient in her family's care -- and potentially spread Ebola. They returned the next day and with much difficulty persuaded her to go to the ETU by ambulance. The day after that her test came back negative. But a survey that International Medical Corps conducted in July and August [2015] shows how long it can take to truly change deep-rooted beliefs and behaviors. Of the 190 people interviewed in 5 areas of Guinea, approximately 18 percent (almost 1 in 5) of them still did not believe Ebola was real.]

Prevention

16 Dec 2015: Liberia: Preventive malaria treatment for contacts of patients with Ebola virus disease in the context of the west Africa 2014-15 Ebola virus disease response: an economic analysis
http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(15)00465-X/abstract
[In Liberia during the wet season, malaria preventive treatment was cost saving even when average daily bed-stay costs were as low as USD5 for children younger than 5 years, USD9 for those aged 5-14 years, and USD22 for those aged 15 years or older. Administration of preventive malaria treatment to contacts of patients with Ebola virus disease should be considered by public health officials when addressing Ebola virus disease outbreaks in countries and seasons where malaria reaches high levels of transmission.]
[Prophylaxis eliminates the problem of contacts who develop severe symptoms from malaria being mistaken for suspected EVD cases, and being admitted to an ETU. - Mod.JW]

["Ebola has never been to East Africa but it is important for us health experts in the region to start taking precautions as such diseases do not choose where to strike," stated Mr Julius Lutwama a medical researcher from Uganda."]
[I`m sure Julius was misquoted; Uganda has had small Ebola outbreaks in 2000-2001, 2007-2008 & 2011-2012 - see ProMED archives, e.g., Ebola virus disease - Uganda (02): (LO) declared Ebola-free Archive Number: 20130117.1502950. I visited Julius at the UVRI on Uganda only last month. He must have been talking about the absence of urban epidemics. - Mod.JW]

[A prominent Hartford [Connecticut] health center has been fined USD 2500 and placed on probation for 1 year for numerous lapses, including mishandling a patient with Ebola-like symptoms. The facility is also required to hire an infection control consultant for at least 3 months who will report to the state Department of Public Health on efforts to correct numerous other violations.]

16 Dec 2015 USA: Protecting the blood supply during a future Ebola outbreak
Although the United States had very few Ebola patients, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently released guidance for the collection of blood and blood components. These strategies aim to prevent infection of the [US] blood supply during any future outbreak of the deadly virus. The FDA's new guidance includes the following recommendations for blood banks and related establishments.
Timing: When the CDC has made a determination that none of the countries surveyed have widespread transmission of the Ebola virus, it is appropriate to discontinue screening blood product donors [in the USA] for their risk of having the virus. The following recommendations only apply when the CDC has determined that at least one country has current widespread transmission...]

14 Dec 2015 Liberia: Eight-month Ebola program launched
http://allafrica.com/stories/201512142760.html
[On Saturday, 12 Dec 2015, the 2nd component of the Ebola Community Action Platform Project (ECAP-2) was launched in Tubmanville, Neekreen Administrative District of Grand Bassa County.
Funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United States Agency for International Development (OFDA), under the management of Mercy Corps, is being implemented in 1500 communities across Liberia's 15 counties by local non-governmental organizations. The 1st phase of the Ebola Community Action Platform ECAP project was launched in January 2015. The program will build community preparedness by supporting and strengthening local infrastructures and existing health systems to prevent a future outbreak of the Ebola virus or any other disease. According to Shalom Executive Director Mrs. Pate Chon, the project will "basically engage the communities, encouraging them to move into action and take their health matters into their own hands, being able to link with the various clinics."
