[Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a disease of cattle and water buffalo caused by _Mycoplasma mycoides_ subsp. _mycoides_ (_M. mycoides_). As the name suggests, it attacks the lungs and the membranes that line the thoracic cavity (the pleura), causing fever and respiratory signs such as laboured or rapid respiration, cough and nasal discharges.

Because it is highly contagious with a mortality rate of up to 50 percent, it causes significant economic losses. CBPP is a prominent cattle disease in Africa.

CBPP is a disease listed by the OIE in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. Member countries are obligated to report occurrences of the disease according to the standards in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code.

CBPP is one of the diseases for which the OIE has official recognition status. The OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code specifies the steps a country must follow in order to be officially recognized by the OIE as free of CBPP (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/CBPP-EN.pdf).

According to Resolution No. 19 (81st General Session, May 2013), members recognised as free from CBPP according to the provisions of the Chapter 11.8 of the Terrestrial Code are: Australia, Botswana, China, India, Portugal, Switzerland and USA (http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/cbbp/list-cbbp-free-members/).

You will note that the date of the start of the event and pre-confirmation of the diagnosis was reported to be July 2013. The official notification, however, was submitted to the OIE almost 2 months later. Member countries should be encouraged (as required by Code Chapter 1.1 Notification of diseases, infections, infestations and epidemiological information, Article 1.1.3 of the Terrestrial Code), to immediately (within 24 hours) report such disease events, or when the member country considers itself free of the disease or has not detected the disease for some time (http://www.oie.int/en/international-standard-setting/terrestrial-code/access-online/?htmfile=chapitre_1.1.1.htm). Since CBPP is of economic significance, trading partners can take certain protective health measures to minimize any impact when a country in the region reports the disease. - Mod.CRD
