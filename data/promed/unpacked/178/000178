Is the UK putting mainland Europe at risk by failing to adopt all the
measures available to it to control foot and mouth? This is the question
being raised this morning as pig producers, compounders and others meet to
press minister of agriculture Nick Brown to call a halt to the buildup of
animals on farms in infected areas.
Regardless of welfare or financial considerations, there is a compelling
disease control argument for the removal of surplus pigs from infected
areas, by slaughter or other safe method, to keep pig numbers in these
areas as low as possible.
This applies particularly to pigs, because they are a Foot and Mouth
Disease (FMD) "producer" species. In other words they are extremely
efficient at spreading the disease and once infected breathe out around a
thousand times more virus per minute than either cattle or sheep.
There has already been lateral spread of FMD in some areas and the disease
is proving difficult to spot in sheep. If infected sheep were to infect
pigs downwind, then the consequences for an explosive spread of the disease
would be terrifying, it is claimed.
Producers argue the [classical] swine fever outbreak in East Anglia
demonstrated the folly of allowing animals to build up in infected areas.
Allowing (or worse, encouraging) farmers to shuffle pigs around to try to
fit them in every nook and cranny, usually in less than ideal conditions,
increases stress and consequently increases the animals' susceptibility to
disease, including FMD.
Spreading pigs out more widely by putting them outside where there were no
pigs before increases the chance of one of them picking up the virus on the
wind, and one is sufficient to infect the remainder.
"Increasing the number of pigs in infected catchment areas increases the
chance of one of them getting it. And we'll soon have 3 weeks' worth of
extra pigs in every infected area," cautions one industry source.
He urges the government to make use of its existing powers under the Animal
Health Act, which empowers the slaughter of (and payment of compensation
for) one or more pigs on a farm in an infected area for the better
execution of FMD control.
"According to the EC, inadequate measures at the beginning of a disease
outbreak increase total cost. If the government is unwilling to allow the
chief veterinary officer to do the right thing, can the EC be called on to
'persuade' them, in order to prevent us infecting France on the wind, and
from there the rest of the EU?" he asks.
Another approach to the pig build-up problem is European Council (EC)
Exceptional Market Support (EMS). There is a view that EMS is designed for
major outbreaks. The biggest recent EMS scheme related to [classical] swine
fever in Holland.
When efforts needed to support the market are large enough, the EC usually
agrees to bear some of government's costs.
As far as pigs outside infected areas are concerned, there is already a
backlog of slaughter animals in the UK and the situation is being
aggravated by a reduction in both slaughter capacity and, apparently,
customer demand.
Some industry sources are arguing that, if surplus pigs can be moved from
infected areas for disease control reasons, then only a percentage of
slaughter pigs need be removed from the market to reverse the backlog.
Storage aid and/or intervention may increase demand (if demand is limiting
slaughter numbers), but such measures might need targeting at the lower
value parts of the carcass (e.g., bellies, shoulder etc.), which UK
normally exports.
The fear has been expressed that if this pig meat goes into storage, it
could upset UK's export status when it comes out of storage.
The Dutch offered the use of their on-farm slaughter and disposal lorries
during the CSF outbreak. Would they be of some use now?
