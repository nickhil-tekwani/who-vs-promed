Date of confirmation of the event: 27 Apr 2017
Reason for notification: Recurrence of a listed disease

Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Foot and mouth disease virus
Serotype A

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Bizerte, Alia sud, Alia, Bizerte
Date of start of the outbreak: 24 Apr 2017
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 32 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 32
Affected population: 2 ill 1-year-old Holstein young bulls. They presented salivation, coughing, lameness and gums and tongue ulcers. On 4 May 2017, the general condition of those animals had improved and ulcers had healed.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 6.25 / 0 / 0 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Introduction of new live animals.
According to field investigations, the affected animals from the 2nd outbreak originated from the 1st outbreak situated in the Imada of Hached.
Epidemiological comments: Control measures applied in the 1st outbreak: ring vaccination and cleanout for 21 days. Furthermore, a ring vaccination was applied in the 2nd outbreak. Results of the matching, sent by the reference laboratory of Pirbright, show that the serotype A22 Iraq of the vaccine used matches the wild serotype responsible of the disease with a ratio r1=0.31.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak (s); disinfection / disinfestation; stamping out; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Veterinary research institute of Tunisia (National laboratory) / Cattle / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 5 May 2017 / Positive
Veterinary research institute of Tunisia (National laboratory) / Cattle / typing ELISA / 5 May 2017 / Positive

Future Reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[In this new report to OIE, it is stated that samples were sent to the World Reference Laboratory for Foot and Mouth Disease in Pirbright (UK) for virus isolation and genotyping. The results show that the vaccine made of strain A22 Iraq which is being used is genetically close to the strain in circulation and will therefore confer immunity against the disease. - Mod.AB

The genotyping results are not available on the Tunisia page of WRLFMD.

Hopefully, in neighboring Algeria, suffering a spreading epizootic caused by the same FMDV-A strain, the vaccination (earlier performed with a heterologous, serotype O vaccine) will switch to a homologous serotype A vaccine. - Mod.AS
