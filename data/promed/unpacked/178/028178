Germany: probable 3rd imported case of West Nile virus infection since 2003
-----------------------------------------------
Transmission of West Nile virus infection within Germany via bites from
mosquitoes that have had contact with migrating birds is thought to be a
possibility, although no such transmission has been reported. Imported
cases are also possible in people returning from areas of high virus
prevalence. In 2003, a 77 year old man from Lower Saxony and a 51 year old
woman from Bavaria became ill with West Nile virus infection after
traveling in areas of high prevalence in the United States (US). A 3rd
probable case has recently been discovered, and is reported here.
A 77 year old woman from Weimar became ill on 20 Sep 2004 during a tourist
trip to California in the US lasting from 4 Sep to 4 Oct 2004. She
developed acute encephalitis with fever, and experienced continuous
impaired consciousness over a few days. The patient was treated in a
hospital in the US from 20 to 30 Sep 2004, and West Nile virus infection
was suspected. After her return to Germany, she experienced further
symptoms of memory impairment and muscle weakness and was treated in
hospital on 11 Oct 2004. The results of serological tests indicated an
acute West-Nile infection: anti-flavivirus IgM ELISA test of blood serum
and cerebrospinal fluid was positive, and according to hemagglutination
tests, the anti-West Nile IgG titre in cerebrospinal fluid was 1:160
positive and in serum 1:2560/5120.
In view of the results, clinical presentation, and the case history (the
patient reported an insect bite during a stay in an epidemic area), West
Nile virus infection is very likely, but further confirmation is still
awaited. The patient is currently recovering in a rehabilitation clinic.
Both a positive antibody result with ELISA and hemagglutination tests can
be induced by other flaviviruses and certain immunizations (for example,
yellow fever, tickborne encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, and St Louis
encephalitis), and so it is necessary to determine whether an immunization
or infection with one of these agents could be the cause of such cases. The
patient in this case had been immunized against yellow fever in 1992. A
neutralization test, which in Germany is currently done only at the
Robert-Koch Institut, is still necessary and will be carried out shortly.
West Nile virus fever is not currently notifiable in Germany, so cases are
notified as "health threats".
