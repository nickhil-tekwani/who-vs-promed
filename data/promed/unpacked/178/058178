First Evidence and Predictions of _Plasmodium_ Transmission in Alaskan Bird Populations
-----------------------------------------------------------
Authors: Loiseau et al. (PlosONE: e44729)

Abstract
--------
The unprecedented rate of change in the Arctic climate is expected to have major impacts on the emergence of infectious diseases and host susceptibility to these diseases. It is predicted that malaria parasites will spread to both higher altitudes and latitudes with global warming. Here we show for the 1st time that avian _Plasmodium_ transmission occurs in the North American Arctic. Over a latitudinal gradient in Alaska, from 61 degrees N to 67 degrees N [the Arctic Circle is 66 degrees 33 minutes 44 seconds North. - Mod.JW], we collected blood samples of resident and migratory bird species. We found both residents and hatch year birds infected with Plasmodium as far north as 64 degrees N, providing clear evidence that malaria transmission occurs in these climates. Based on our empirical data, we make the 1st projections of the habitat suitability for Plasmodium under a future-warming scenario in Alaska. These findings raise new concerns about the spread of malaria to naive host populations.

It is known that, within limits, arthropod populations are favored by heat and moisture. Therefore, it is expected that climate change will influence vector-borne diseases. In fact, a number of vector-borne human and domestic animal diseases, including malaria, have increased in incidence or geographic range in recent decades (e.g., African trypanosomiasis, tick-borne encephalitis, yellow fever, plague, dengue, African horse sickness, bluetongue). _Plasmodium_ parasites are transmitted by mosquitoes. _Culiseta alaskaensis_ is one of the main mosquitoes present in a large part of Alaska state. It is not known whether it may be a competent vector, but it has previously been demonstrated that a related mosquito (_Culiseta morsitans_) can indeed transmit the disease.
