Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses (HPAI) and Human Infection
--------------------------------------------------
[The following information on Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses
(HPAI) in relation to human infection has been extracted from a paper

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Ancestral Viruses, Northern Europe", by

Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), which originate in
poultry upon transmission of low pathogenic viruses (LPAI) from wild birds,
have occurred relatively frequently in the last decade. During our ongoing
surveillance studies in wild birds, we isolated several influenza A viruses
of hemagglutinin subtype H5 and H7 that contain various neuraminidase
subtypes. For each of the recorded H5 and H7 HPAI outbreaks in Europe since
1997, our collection contained closely related virus isolates recovered
from wild birds, as determined by sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of
the hemagglutinin gene and antigenic characterization of the hemagglutinin
glycoprotein. The minor genetic and antigenic diversity between the viruses
recovered from wild birds and those causing HPAI outbreaks indicates that
influenza A virus surveillance studies in wild birds can help generate
prototypic vaccine candidates and design and evaluate diagnostic tests,
before outbreaks occur in anim!
als and humans.
Wild birds, predominantly ducks, geese, and shorebirds, form the reservoir
of influenza A viruses in nature (1,2). Influenza A viruses are subtyped on
the basis of the antigenic properties of the hemagglutinin (HA) and
neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins, expressed on the surface of virus
particles. To date, 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been detected in wild
birds and poultry throughout the world (3,4).
Viruses containing HA of subtypes H5 and H7 may become highly pathogenic
after introduction in poultry and cause outbreaks of highly pathogenic
avian influenza (HPAI, formerly termed fowl plague) (1,2). The switch from
a low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) phenotype, common in wild birds and
poultry, to the HPAI phenotype is achieved by the introduction of basic
amino acid residues into the HA0 cleavage site (5). HPAI isolates have been
obtained primarily from commercially raised birds such as chickens,
turkeys, quail, guinea fowl, and ostriches (6). In the last decade, the
frequency of detected HPAI outbreaks has increased, with outbreaks of avian
influenza A viruses of subtype H5N2 in Mexico (1994); Italy (1997) and
Texas (2004); H5N1 in Hong Kong (1997) and Southeast Asia (ongoing since
1997); H7N3 in Australia and Pakistan (1994); H7N4 in Australia (1997);
H7N1 in Italy (1999); H7N3 in Chile (2002) and Canada (2003); and H7N7 in
the Netherlands (2003) (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 1!
2 ,13, 14, 15).
Influenza A viruses of subtypes H5 and H7 have been frequently detected in
mammals (16). H7N7 viruses have been endemic in horses for some time (17),
were transmitted from seals to humans in the United States in 1980 (18,19),
and were isolated from humans in the United Kingdom in 1996 (20) and the
Netherlands in 2003 (12,13). H7N2 and H7N3 influenza A viruses were
isolated from humans in the United States in 2003 (21,22) and Canada in
2004 (23), respectively. HPAI H5N1 viruses circulating in Southeast Asia
since 2003 have been detected in at least 108 human cases of respiratory
illness, of which 54 were fatal (24). In addition, these H5N1 influenza A
viruses have been detected in pigs, cats, leopards, and tigers in Southeast
Asia. As a consequence of the relatively frequent zoonoses caused by
influenza A viruses of subtypes H5 and H7, these virus subtypes are given
high priority with respect to pandemic preparedness.
Wild birds harbor the LPAI ancestral viruses of HPAI strains of poultry
(and mammals). In our influenza A virus surveillance studies in wild birds
in northern Europe, we detected numerous influenza A viruses of subtype H5
and H7 in Mallards (_Anas platyrhynchos_). For each of the HPAI outbreaks
that occurred in Europe since 1997, we have found close LPAI relatives in
Mallards. Our observations indicate that influenza A virus surveillance in
wild birds provides opportunities for pandemic preparation; the prototype
influenza A viruses obtained from wild birds may guide production of
vaccines as well as reagents to develop and validate diagnostic tests.
The body of the paper contains a map of migration routes of waterfowl in
northern Europe, phylogenetic analysis and antigenic characterization of
some 172 samples isolated during the period 1999-2002 in the Netherlands
and Sweden. The authors conclude that: Because HPAI outbreaks in poultry
find their origin in LPAI viruses present in waterfowl, influenza A virus
surveillance in wild birds could function as an early warning system for
HPAI outbreaks and as a means to keep panels of reference reagents,
required for diagnostic purposes and vaccine production, up-to-date. Wild
bird surveillance would also be relevant for HPAI viruses that represent
pandemic threats. Minor antigenic and genetic diversity were observed among
the HA genes of Mallard influenza A virus isolates and those of HPAI virus
strains.
This finding implies that the influenza A virus isolates obtained during
wild bird surveillance studies may also be prototypic vaccine candidates
for human or veterinary use. Limited numbers of prototype vaccine strains,
representing both the American and Eurasian genetic lineages of influenza A
virus, could be generated to cover a wide range of HPAI strains. Such
vaccine seed strains can be produced well ahead of outbreaks in poultry,
other animals, or humans. The disadvantage of the minor antigenic
differences between the vaccine strain and the epidemic strains will likely
be compensated by the immediate availability of the vaccine. An additional
advantage of the use of LPAI strains from wild birds as prototype vaccine
strains is that they do not contain a basic cleavage site in the HA gene.
Before HPAI strains can be used as vaccine candidates, the basic amino acid
residues in the HA gene need to be removed by using reverse genetics
technology; this would result in an extra!
modification step, which would consume precious time. Moreover, these
vaccine strains can be generated only after an outbreak of HPAI has started.
