An outbreak of _Yersinia_ in Sweden has ended with iceberg lettuce as the suspected source of infection. From January until the beginning of February 2021, twice as many people fell ill with _Yersinia_ infection as did during the same period in a normal year.

From 53 cases of _Y. enterocolitica_, 33 lived in Stockholm, Vastra Gotaland, and Halland. Isolates from 24 of these cases were typed by whole genome sequencing and 16 outbreak patients with clustered isolates of sequence type 18 could be identified. Of these 16, 11 were women and 5 were men aged 7 to 34 years old. All fell ill between [4 and 18 Jan 2021].

Rikard Dryselius, a microbiologist at Folkhalsomyndigheten (Public Health Agency of Sweden), said collection and typing of _Yersinia_ isolates is not done routinely in the country. "Instead, individual counties can ask for help with typing _Yersinia_ when they see a need. Alternatively, we may ask the laboratories to send in isolates if we see an increase in cases nationally that should be investigated," he said.

"Due to the strained situation for infection control units and clinical laboratories during the pandemic, we chose to request interviews/questionnaire responses and collection of isolates only from the counties where the increase was highest. It is therefore very likely that there were more than 16 outbreak cases but the lack of additional isolates to sequence means that we cannot confirm this."

Folkhalsomyndigheten, infection control units in the Stockholm, Vastra Gotaland, and Halland regions, and Livsmedelsverket (Swedish Food Agency) investigated the incident. Health officials interviewed sick people and compiled questionnaire responses about what and where they ate before illness onset. A case-case study where questionnaire responses from outbreak cases were compared with answers from people with _Yersinia_ infection that did not belong to the outbreak was done.

The investigators found the outbreak cases had, to a greater extent, visited a certain restaurant chain. Follow-up interviews about what they had eaten led to iceberg lettuce being suspected as the source of infection. According to the trawling questionnaire sent to outbreak cases, 7 out of 12 mentioned they had visited the restaurant chain before falling ill, while 7 out of 72 cases with yersiniosis who responded to the same questionnaire in 2019 mentioned that they had done so.

The suspicion of a contaminated batch of iceberg lettuce distributed to a restaurant chain was strengthened by the outbreak timeline, which suggested that a product with a wide geographical spread and a limited shelf life was the underlying cause. Sweden has no significant production of iceberg lettuce at this time of year and attempts are being made to trace the country of origin.

[It is not stated where the lettuce was imported from and whether the strain is related to a recent outbreak in Norway.

The 2 species of _Yersinia_ associated with foodborne disease are _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and _Y. enterocolitica_. The latter species can be associated with abdominal pain as a hallmark symptom. As a mesenteric lymphadenitis, yersiniosis can mimic appendicitis but may also cause infections of other sites, such as wounds, joints, and the urinary tract.

As noted in the FDA "Bad Bug Book" (https://bit.ly/3pmDJN1), "Strains of _Y. enterocolitica_ can be found in meats (pork, beef, lamb, etc.), oysters, fish, and raw milk. The exact cause of the food contamination is unknown. However, the prevalence of this organism in soil, water, and animals, such as beavers, pigs, and squirrels, offers ample opportunities for it to enter our food supply. Poor sanitation and improper sterilization techniques by food handlers, including improper storage, cannot be overlooked as contributing to contamination."

In addition, some strains of these organisms can be associated with blood transfusion-associated illnesses due to an ability to grow at refrigerator temperatures. - Mod.LL
