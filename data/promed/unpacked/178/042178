Poliomyelitis in Indonesia, 6 Jun 2005
--------------------------------------
On 6 Jun 2005, 4 new polio cases were confirmed in Indonesia,
bringing the total number of cases to 20. One of the 4 new cases is
from the same district as the index case (Sukabumi district), and 3
are from neighboring districts (Lebak and Cianjur districts).
On 2 May 2005, the global reference laboratory in Mumbai, India,
confirmed a wild poliovirus type 1 isolate, from an acute flaccid
paralysis (AFP) case identified by the national surveillance system
in Giri Jaya village, Sukabumi District, West Java, Indonesia. The
case, an 18-month-old child who was previously unimmunized, had
onset of paralysis on 13 Mar 2005.
>From 31 May to 2 Jun [2005], a polio immunization "mop-up" campaign
was conducted, covering West Java, Banten and Jakarta provinces, to
reach 6.4 million children under the age of 5 years. Planning for the
2nd-round campaign (to be held on 28-29 Jun [2005]) has begun.
The findings of the investigation suggest a recent introduction of
wild poliovirus. The genetic analysis of the virus demonstrates that
its origin is in west Africa, similar to the viruses which caused the
2003/04 outbreak. Further analysis suggests the virus traveled to
Indonesia through Sudan, and is similar to recently isolated viruses
in Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
Indonesia has not had a wild poliovirus case since 1995.

[The number of cases of confirmed poliomyelitis in Indonesia has
been increasing, along with some documented geographic extension into
neighboring districts. The index case resided in Sukabumi district.
Of the 20 confirmed cases thus far, 14 are from Sukabumi district,
and 6 are from neighboring districts (Lebak, Cianjur and Bogor
districts). The initial vaccination activities surrounding the
identification of the index case consisted of an outbreak response
immunization in 4 villages in the immediate areas of the case,
reaching 4000 children aged less than 5 years on approximately 23 Apr
2005. At that time, 7 additional acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases
were identified in the same village as the index case. Additional AFP
cases were identified in neighboring villages in the same district as
the index case, and in neighboring districts as detailed above.
Hopefully, the wide geographic coverage of the mop up vaccination
activities involving 3 Provinces (West Java, Banten and Jakarta) will
result in interruption of transmission of the wild poliovirus in
Indonesia.
Global updates of numbers of confirmed polio cases worldwide as of 1
Jun 2005 from the polio eradication website
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>
are shown below, along with the classification of country.
Global cases of poliovirus: 386
----------
Yemen (importation) 179
Nigeria (endemic) 131
Sudan (re-established transmission) 25
Indonesia (importation) 16
India (endemic) 15
Ethiopia (importation) 10
Pakistan (endemic) 7
Cameroon (importation) 1
Niger (endemic) 1
Afghanistan (endemic) 1
Egypt (endemic) 0
The number of cases shown for Indonesia do not reflect these 4 cases
reported in the above posting, as their confirmation came after 1 Jun
2005. Note that both Indonesia and Yemen are not considered as
endemic countries, and the current transmission of wild poliovirus in
those 2 countries is classified as due to importation. - Mod.MPP]
