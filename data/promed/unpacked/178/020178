CDC is collaborating with public health officials in multiple states across
the USA and with the Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection
Service to investigate an ongoing multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_
I,4,[5],12:i:- infections in humans. An investigation that used interviews
comparing foods eaten by ill and well persons is showing that eating
Banquet brand pot pies produced by the ConAgra Foods company is the likely
source of the illness.
Between 1 Jan 2007 and 9 Oct 2007, at least 139 isolates of _Salmonella_
I,4,[5],12:i:- with an indistinguishable genetic fingerprint have been
collected from ill persons in 30 states. Ill persons whose salmonella
strain has this genetic fingerprint have been reported from Arizona (1
person), California (5), Connecticut (3), Delaware (5), Georgia (2), Idaho
(2), Illinois (3), Indiana (3), Kansas (2), Kentucky (7), Massachusetts
(5), Maryland (5), Maine (1), Minnesota (5), Missouri (11), Montana (4),
Nevada (6), New York (6), Ohio (6), Oklahoma (1), Oregon (2), Pennsylvania
(13), Tennessee (5), Texas (4), Utah (2), Virginia (6), Vermont (2),
Washington (1), Wisconsin (19), Wyoming (2). Their ages range from less
than one to 87 years with a median age of 20 years; 49 per cent of ill
persons are female. At least 20 people have been hospitalized. No deaths
have been reported.
Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
CDC is coordinating a case-control study designed to identify the source of
these infections. A case was defined as salmonella infection on or after 1
Aug 2007 with a strain that had the outbreak genetic fingerprint. Reverse
address directories were used to enroll control persons, who were matched
to cases by age group and state of residence. Eating a Banquet brand pot
pie was significantly associated with illness. The outbreak appears to be
ongoing.
Clinical features
-----------------
Most people infected with salmonella develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal
cramps 12-72 hours after infection. Infection is usually diagnosed by
culture of a stool sample. The illness usually lasts 4-7 days. Although
most people recover without treatment, severe infections may occur.
Infants, elderly people, and people with impaired immune systems are more
likely than others to develop severe illness. In severe infection,
salmonella spreads from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other
body sites, and death can occur if the person is not treated promptly with
antibiotics.
Advice to consumers
-------------------
At this time, CDC recommends that people do not eat any Banquet pot pies or
pot pies made by ConAgra Foods that have a printed code ending in "P9."
Other brands of pot pies made in the ConAgra Foods factory that makes
Banquet brand pot pies and sold under other brand names may also be
contaminated with salmonella. These other pot pie boxes also have a printed
code ending in "P9." If you have any of these products at home, the safest
thing to do is to discard them.

[_Salmonella enterica_ I 4,[5],12:i:-
<http://msc.tigr.org/salmonella/salmonella_enterica_subsp__enterica_serovar_4__5__12_i___str__cvm23701/index.shtml>
was 1st identified in the USA in 1998 and became the 14th most common
serotype recovered from human illness in 2002. In 1998, this was the 4th
most commonly identified serotype in Spain. Pulsed field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns for most I 4,[5],12:i:- isolates suggest
evolutionary links with _S._ Typhimurium. Analysis of this related genovar
of increasing health importance can help uncover evolutionary aspects of
the _S._ Typhimurium complex, the most common salmonella pathogen. - Mod.LL]
