[For the 1st time in 60 years, there has been a] tularemia outbreak
in the Thrace Region (European Part) of Turkey. The 1st patient from
Demirkoy Village of Edirne Province was diagnosed with oropharyngeal
tularemia on 28 Feb 2005.
In the same week, 266 of 400 villagers were examined and their sera were
taken. Cases were diagnosed according to the Turkish Communicable Diseases
Notification System. Throat swabs and lymph node aspirates were cultured.
Specific antibodies in patients and domestic animals were screened by the
micro-agglutination test. Water samples from the reservoir of tap water and
from 3 springs were cultured after filtering. PCR [polymerase chain
reaction] assays of the samples of patients and water sources were
performed, along with active surveillance to identify risk factors.
10 tularemia cases were diagnosed, 7 with the oropharyngeal form and 3
asymptomatic. The cultures were negative; however PCR assays were positive
in one lymph node aspirate and [water from] one spring. Some animals had
specific antibody at low levels. Increased mouse population in the
vicinity, exposure to wild rabbits, and drinking from one of the springs
(PCR-negative) were identified as risk factors with the risk ratios (and 95
percent confidence intervals) as 10.5 (10.3-10.7), 6.5 (5.43-7.57) and 2.1
(1.1-2.5), respectively.
Therapeutic and preventive measures were taken. Local physicians were
informed to be aware of the disease.

[ProMED would like to thank Dr. Gurcan for this contribution.
To a considerable extent, as here, water-borne outbreaks of tularemia
have been (not surprisingly) associated with the oropharyngeal form
of the disease. Outbreaks of water-transmitted tularemia include 64
cases in Dagestan, Russia associated with a flood-plain swamp (1), 49
cases in Tuscany, Italy linked to an unchlorinated water system (2),
an outbreak in the Smolensk province of Russia also attributed to
contamination of a water supply (3), improperly prepared water for
washing in the Czech Republic (4), and a Swedish outbreak associated with
a contaminated well used for drinking water (5). Additionally, during
the period 1936 to 1963, there were approximately 30 outbreaks of
water-borne tularemia reported from the then Soviet Union (6).
