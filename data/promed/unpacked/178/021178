INFLUENZA - AUSTRALIA (2)
=========================
[Regarding Karl Johnson's comment on influenza activity in Australia
("Influenza - Australia: RFI")]:
Karl is right. I can't ascertain as yet whether the key players in
flu surveillance in Australia are on PROMED, but I am informed that
the WHO collaborating lab at Fairfield in Melbourne has had 1 A
isolate and 2 A serological diagnoses in the last week. Activity has
been low as expected.
I hope more complete information will follow in due course.
