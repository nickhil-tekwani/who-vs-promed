Doctors say an encephalitis outbreak has killed 130 people -- mostly
children -- in northern India since January [2009]. The outbreak of
acute encephalitis -- an inflammation of brain tissue -- is mostly
concentrated in eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh, said VS Nigam, the
state's nodal officer for tackling the disease. He told CNN that 640
patients had tested positive for the infection, including 30 with
Japanese encephalitis, which is spread by mosquitoes.

Acute encephalitis can be spread in various ways, including a
bacterial or viral infection; the ingesting of toxic substances; and
complications of a disease.

The disease has mostly struck children up to 15 years old, Nigam added.

[The outbreak of encephalitis in eastern Uttar Pradesh continues to
grow. The etiology (etiologies?) of the encephalitis outbreak
reported above is somewhat confusing. Clearly, Japanese encephalitis
virus is involved in some of these cases. That is not surprising as
Uttar Pradesh is endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus. The open
question concerns the remaining 610 patients that were reported as
"testing positive." Positive for what? ProMED-mail would appreciate
receiving additional information as it become available.
