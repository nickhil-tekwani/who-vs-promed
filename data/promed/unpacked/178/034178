Staff of the Minnesota Department of Health in St Paul discuss an outbreak of measles in an unvaccinated community. Researchers identified 21 cases of measles (median age, 12 months), 14 of whom required hospitalization. A 30 month old US-born child of Somali descent, infected while visiting Kenya, was identified as the source. 16 case patients were unvaccinated; 9 of these were age-eligible, and 6 were of Somali descent. Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine coverage decreased significantly, from 91.1 per cent in 2004 to 54.0 per cent in 2010 among the Somali community.

A case of the measles recently spread to an infant in Highland County, the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) and the Highland County Health Department confirmed on Monday [9 Jun 2014]. Health officials believe the baby contracted the illness in May 2014, when he and his family traveled to north central Ohio. The infant is less than 6 months old. "Contracting measles is especially serious for infants younger than one year of age," said ODH state epidemiologist Dr Mary DiOrio. "Parents with infants too young to be vaccinated should consider not traveling with them to areas where measles outbreaks are occurring."

About 240 cases have been confirmed in the Ohio measles outbreak, and it is the largest outbreak in the United States since 1994.

The Ohio Department of Health and local health departments are investigating a measles outbreak that began in late March 2014, accounting for at least 6 cases in Stark County. The state department says unvaccinated travelers to the Philippines brought the respiratory disease to Ohio, where it has largely spread among Amish and Mennonite communities from north-central to southwest counties.

All of Stark County's cases come from a single Mennonite family in the Uniontown area, said Sherry Smith, director of nursing services at the Stark County Health Department. The father and 5 children were infected after traveling to Wayne County. The mother had been vaccinated. "They are no longer in the infectious period," Smith said. The county will continue to investigate anyone who came into contact with the family before they were isolated and treated. They'll also be visiting area Amish communities to encourage vaccination.

Ohio's measles outbreak is centered in Knox County, which has 187 of the state's 298 cases. Ashland, Coshocton, Highland, Holmes, Richland and Wayne counties are also affected. On Wednesday [11 Jun 2014], the state announced new vaccination guidelines, which include an early dose to "high-risk" children aged 6 to 11 months who are in direct contact with the Amish community.

The number of cases of measles in the United States in 2014 has already doubled compared with the total number of cases seen during 2013. On Tuesday [11 Jun 2014], Utah's 1st case of the respiratory illness was confirmed by the Utah Department of Health, adding to the growing number of cases seen since the illness was eliminated from the US 14 years ago.

The Utah case was confirmed in an adult from the south eastern part of the state last month [May 2014]. Health educator with the Utah Department of Health, Rebecca Ward, said the individual picked up the illness while traveling in Europe with only one dose of the measles vaccine. Two doses are recommended for full protection.

According to CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], nearly all of the US cases were brought in from people visiting other countries. 397 cases of the illness have been seen across the nation so far this year [2014]. The last time the state saw a case of measles was in 2012.

With health authorities and medical personnel battling Guinea's 1st outbreak of Ebola virus disease, there have inevitably been concerns about finding the human and physical resources to combat other diseases. Unlike Ebola, measles and meningitis are well known to Guinea and require a major, coordinated response from both the state and NGOs. Despite the "Ebola Factor", health organizations say they have maintained their operations and are combating measles and meningitis effectively.

Due to low vaccination coverage, Guinea is hit by major outbreaks of measles every few years. Last year [2013], 143 cases of measles were reported across several regions. During a 2009 epidemic, there were 4755 suspected cases, most of which were concentrated in and around Conakry. Ten children died. Just 37 percent of children in Guinea are fully vaccinated, according to UNICEF. The fight to contain the spread of Ebola has inevitably drawn more media attention, but health experts say that, away from the headlines, essential work is being done on other diseases. "It's never easy, but the response has been quite good," said Corinne Benazech, Head of Mission for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in Guinea. MSF continues to provide measles treatment free-of-charge, as well as for follow-up cases where there have been complications.

UNICEF, WHO, MSF, and other aid groups launched massive vaccination campaigns targeting 1.6 million children under 10 after the government declared a measles outbreak in January 2014. But the IFRC too is still heavily implicated in work against measles. In February 2014, it released around USD 135 000 to support Guinea's Red Cross Society and mobilized more than 800 volunteers to help with UNICEF's mass vaccination campaign, as well as educating and sensitizing families throughout the country about the symptoms, origin and modes of transmission of measles. La Rose said the vaccination campaign, which lasted about 2 weeks, was deemed successful as it stopped the immediate outbreak of measles and dramatically slowed down the spread. Health workers say they are now monitoring and treating new cases as they arise. Despite bringing the latest measles and meningitis outbreaks under control, Guinea's health service still suffers from a weak public health infrastructure and poor levels of sanitation. Many of the country's hospitals and health clinics lack access to clean water, electricity and basic medical equipment.

Outbreaks of measles in several regions have left thousands of Somali children at risk of disability or death unless they are urgently vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, according to a joint statement released by WHO and UNICEF today [10 Jun 2014]. In March and April 2014, there were over 1350 suspected cases of measles, 4 times the number seen during the same period last year [2013], and nearly 1000 cases were reported in May 2014 alone.

In response, the health authorities, with the support of UNICEF, WHO, and partners, have conducted small scale vaccination campaigns and will carry out larger emergency campaigns in the most affected areas of Bari, Nugaal, Mudug, Banadir and Lower Juba in June 2014 targeting half a million children under 5.

Two decades of conflict have decimated Somalia's health sector, leaving the country with some of the worst health and nutrition indicators in the world. An estimated one in 5 children dies before their 5th birthday, with measles as one of the main causes. It is estimated that less than a 3rd of Somali children under one year were vaccinated against measles in 2013 through routine immunization services. In some areas in central and southern Somalia, insecurity has meant that immunization coverage is as low as 15 per cent.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health department on Friday [13 Jun 2014] announced it would book 3 of its technicians for intentional murder over 4 deaths during the recent anti-measles campaign in the province. It also announced suspension of 10 doctors and health technicians from Peshawar hospitals for negligence in this case. The suspension had been ordered in the light of a high-level inquiry into the deaths of 4 children and hospitalisation of dozens in Peshawar after their vaccination against measles during the 12-day campaign, which began across the province on 19 May 2014. The inquiry committee reported that the accused wrongly administered anti-measles vaccine to children causing their deaths, an action ranked as intentional murder under the Pakistan Penal Code.

The minister said technicians didn't administer vaccine properly, and officials said around 9.6 million children were vaccinated during the campaign and that the federal government had purchased anti-measles vaccines used in it from India. There followed formation of an inquiry committee headed by Peshawar deputy commissioner Zaheerul Islam and consisting of senior doctors and a representative of WHO.

"The committee found that 3 technicians didn't inject vaccines properly to children, thus causing their deaths. In this light, the 3 have been suspended forthwith, and a case against them will be registered under Section 302 of the PPC," said Shahram Tarakai, who was accompanied by information minister Shah Farman. The minister said the government had zero tolerance for medical negligence and that action would be taken against the culpable ones under the law. He said the health department had ordered suspension of the provincial Expanded Programme for Immunisation coordinator Dr Janbaz Afridi and that Rs 500 000 [USD 5000] would be paid to the family of every child who had died of improper administration of vaccination as compensation. Earlier, information minister Shah Farman said the anti-corruption department had either arrested or issued orders for the arrest of 144 government employees for corruption during the ongoing campaign. He said Rs 13.9 million [USD 142 000] in ill-gotten money had been recovered from the said employees.

The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) yesterday [13 Jun 2014] urged the public to take precautions against measles as the nation saw its 16th case of the viral infection so far this year [2014]. A 24 year old Taiwanese woman was confirmed to have contracted measles on 6 Jun 2014 after she came into contact with a previous confirmed case, a 45 year old Taiwanese woman who got infected in China, the CDC said. The latest patient, also the 2nd indigenous one reported this year, might have gotten infected on 24 May 2014, when she and the 45 year old shared the same waiting area to see a doctor, the CDC said.

The agency called for caution amid higher instances of measles infections in neighboring countries than in previous years. China, for example, reported 35 677 measles cases during the 1st 5 months of this year [2014], a 95 per cent increase over last year. Travelers to affected countries are advised to pay attention to personal hygiene and seek medical treatment if they develop symptoms like fever, nasal inflammation or rash, the CDC said.

Queensland Health has issued a measles alert after a girl who travelled to Brisbane on an international flight was diagnosed with the disease. The case -- the state's 37th this year [2014] -- was detected after the girl arrived on Air Niugini flight PX25 from Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea on Monday [11 Jun 2014] last week and presented to the Mater Children's Hospital on Saturday [14 Jun 2014].

A Communicable Diseases Unit senior medical officer said the girl had also attended 2 general practices, one in Chermside shopping centre, and the other in Albany Creek in the past week. He said the surgeries and the Mater hospital were contacting patients who may have been exposed.

Students at a Hamilton school have been plagued by a possible measles outbreak. Waikato District Health Board medical officer of health said she had confirmed 8 cases of the deadly virus from Fraser High School, but that number could balloon out to more than 35. "Nearly all possible cases have been linked to Fraser High," she said.

The patients identified were between 13 and 19 years of age and had been mostly treated by local GPs. Patient swabs have been sent to Christchurch to confirm the presence of the virus, but at this stage, no-one had been admitted to hospital for more than one night.

A serious measles outbreak in Waikato has health officials warning the public to get immunised. 53 measles cases are being investigated, and a large number of infected Fraser High School students are currently in quarantine.

Waikato Health Board medical officer of health Dr Anita Bell expects numbers will only climb due to the huge role Fraser High School staff and students play within the community. "While one in 10 on average requires hospitalisation, admission rates in this outbreak have been higher," says Dr Bell, who also reiterates that immunisation is the best protection from the disease.
