The common measles, combined with a fragile immune system and severe malnutrition, have been cited in the possible deaths of 15 Orang Asli of Kampung Kuala Koh in Gua Musang [Kelantan state], says the Health Ministry.

But health authorities are concerned that only a handful of the Orang Asli have received the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination needed that would have strengthened them against the disease. Describing the deaths as a "wake-up call", Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad said only 61.5% of those in Kampung Kuala Koh have received their 1st dose of MMR vaccine, and only a mere 30% have received booster shots. "The main factor that has caused the spread of measles among the Orang Asli in Kampung Kuala Koh is the low coverage of MMR immunisation among them. "This, added with malnutrition, has contributed to the risk of infection and complications.

"This is a real wake-up call. In our mission to provide universal health coverage and not to leave anyone behind, we need to ensure what happened in Kampung Kuala Koh does not recur," he told a press conference [in Putrajaya] yesterday [17 Jun 2019].

Dr Dzulkefly said the nomadic lifestyle of the Bateq tribe had made it even more challenging for the ministry's medical teams to reach out to them and provide the necessary health services. "During my visits to Orang Asli settlements in Cameron Highlands [Pahang state], we saw how the immunisation level there is at 100%. This needs to be our benchmark. "The ministry will take this on and work with other agencies, such as the Orang Asli Development Department to prevent a repeat of Kampung Kuala Koh," he said.

Dr Dzulkefly said laboratory tests found that 37 out of 112 people examined tested positive for measles. "Lab tests for other diseases, such as tuberculosis, melioidosis, leptospirosis, and coronavirus have proven negative," he said.

There are reportedly 15 deaths due to the outbreak so far, with 3 classified dead due to pneumonia and multiple organ failure, due to complications from measles.

The most recent death was of toddler at the Raja Perempuan Zainab Hospital in Kota Baru on [Sun 16 Jun 2019]. The 2.5-year-old child was suffering from severe malnutrition and weighed 7kg [15.4 lb], which was unusually light for children of that age. "Because of severe malnutrition, the child's immunity became low, causing him to suffer from measles. "After being afflicted by measles, the child suffered from pneumonia complications and multi-organ failure," said Dr Dzulkefly.

He also said that the police and the ministry's forensic team had exhumed 12 bodies from graves at Kampung Kuala Koh. A post-mortem will be conducted on the remains at the Hospital Gua Musang to ascertain the causes of death.

Dr Dzulkefly said the ministry would ramp up its immunisation drive to all Orang Asli residing in affected areas and increase the Infection Prevention Control (IPC) at its health facilities. "Other states have also been asked to raise their measles infection surveillance. If there are deaths displaying similar symptoms, the state governments must alert the ministry immediately via the Crisis Preparedness and Response Centre," Dr Dzulkefly added.

[According to ProMED-mail post Undiagnosed illness - Malaysia: fatalities, iron mining wastewater, TB susp, RFI 20190610.6511742, an outbreak in the Bateq indigenous community in northeastern Malaysia that affected all age groups started during the 1st week of May 2019. Many were said to have suffered from cough, fever, and breathing difficulties, but no mention was made of a skin rash.

The outbreak has now affected a total of 112 individuals; 15 have died. Postmortem reports of 2 patients suggest the cause of death was pneumonia. As mentioned in the article above, death in the latest patient was reported to have been complicated by secondary bacterial pneumonia and multiorgan failure (https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2019/06/496885/batek-boy-dies-after-eight-days-hospital). Recently, 37 out of the 112 are said to have tested positive for measles and the measles immunization rate in this community us said to be particularly low. Although tuberculosis (TB) had been suspected, the news report above says that tuberculosis, melioidosis, and leptospirosis have been ruled out.

Measles outbreaks can have high attack rates in unimmunized communities with many deaths, especially among young, malnourished children, particularly those with vitamin A deficiency. Measles symptoms typically include high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, and rash that appears 3 to 5 days after the 1st symptoms. Serious complications include pneumonia and encephalitis. As many as 1 out of every 20 children with measles gets pneumonia due to the measles virus itself or bacterial superinfection, and is the most common cause of death from measles in young children (https://www.cdc.gov/measles/symptoms/complications.html).

In immunocompromised persons, diffuse progressive pneumonitis caused by the measles virus may occur in the absence of a rash, and is the most common cause of death in these patients (https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/189/Supplement_1/S4/823958).

How the diagnosis of the illness among the Bateq was confirmed to be measles is not stated in the news report above. However, serologic testing by enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) for IgM antibody is commonly used to confirm the diagnosis. The IgM antibody response is transient, being detectable for at least 30 days after rash onset. Tests that are negative in the 1st 72 hours after rash onset should be repeated.

The Bateq are part of the Orang Asli indigenous people of Peninsular Malaysia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batek_people). Orang Asli constitute only 0.5% (about 150 000 people) of the total population of Malaysia; the majority of Orang Asli live in rural areas in poverty, with a high infant mortality rate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orang_Asli). Gua Musang is a town, district and parliamentary constituency in southern Kelantan, Malaysia. Kelantan, located in the northeastern corner of the peninsula is a state of Malaysia on the border with Thailand to the north (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelantan).
