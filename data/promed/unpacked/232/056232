Health officials in Nyaruguru District [Southern province] are on a
high alert after 2 of the 5 suspected cases of measles reported in
Ruheru Sector tested positive. Talking to The New Times, Anastase
Karemera, a district official in charge of health, said that the cases
were reported at Ruheru Health Centre where the children are currently
admitted. "We sent samples to Kigali [the capital] for testing, 2 of
the 5 samples have been confirmed," said Karemera on telephone. The
official said that measles [cases] were rare in the district with the
last case recorded about 5 years ago.

Ruheru Sector lies at the border with neighbouring Burundi, which
could be a potential source of the disease, but according to Karemera,
it is still too early to determine where the disease could have been
transmitted from. "The 2 places in which the disease has been reported
are quite far from the border though there is a lot of cross border
movement."

A team of health officials from the Centre for treatment and research
on AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other epidemics, and the National
University of Rwanda School of Public Health, has been dispatched to
the area to follow up on the outbreak. Measles is one of the causes of
child mortality in Rwanda, accounting for less than 2 percent of
deaths of children under 5, even though the vaccine against the
disease is available.

Measles is one of the leading causes of death among young children
even though a safe and cost-effective vaccine is available. In 2008,
there were 164 000 measles deaths globally -- nearly 450 deaths every
day or 18 deaths every hour. More than 95 percent of measles deaths
occur in low-income countries with weak health infrastructures.
Measles vaccination resulted in a 78 percent drop in measles deaths
between 2000 and 2008 worldwide.

[Significantly these are the 1st confirmed cases of measles in the
Nyaruguru District since 2005, suggesting a relaxation in prophylactic
vaccination in the region. The 1st sign of measles is usually a high
fever, which begins about 10 to 12 days after exposure to the virus,
and lasts 4 to 7 days. A runny nose, a cough, red and watery eyes, and
small white spots inside the cheeks can develop in the initial stage.
After several days, a rash erupts, usually on the face and upper neck.
Over about 3 days, the rash spreads, eventually reaching the hands and
feet. The rash lasts for 5 to 6 days, and then fades. On average, the
rash occurs 14 days after exposure to the virus (within a range of 7
to 18 days). Severe measles is more likely among poorly nourished
young children, especially those with insufficient vitamin A, or whose
immune systems have been weakened by HIV/AIDS or other diseases.
