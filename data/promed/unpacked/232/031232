Fatal disease showing up in more house cats
---------------------
Local veterinarians are warning pet owners that a deadly disease has
afflicted a number of house cats in northeast Georgia.
About 20 cases of cytauxzoonosis, a tick-transmitted parasitic disease that
destroys a cat's red blood cells, have popped up in the area since March
2004, said Doris Miller, director of Athens Diagnostic Lab.
Veterinarian Kourtney Morrissette said those numbers were alarming because
only a handful of cases usually show up each year.
The disease, transmitted from wild bobcats to domestic cats, kills the
majority of domestic cats it infects within days, while bobcats can carry
the parasite with no ill effect. Signs include jaundice, high fever,
lethargy, and rapid weight loss.
Experts say the rise in cases may be attributed to more ticks or more
bobcats in the area.
While there's no vaccination for the disease, it can be treated and cured
if caught in the early stages. Veterinarians suggest using a strong topical
anti-flea and anti-tick agent to prevent tick bites.
