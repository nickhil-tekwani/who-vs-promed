MONKEYPOX - SUDAN: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

On 27 Oct 2005, the Medecins Sans Frontieres France team in Bentiu, Unity
State, Sudan, were alerted by the case of an 8-month-old infant who
presented a generalized vesiculo-papular rash that could resemble pox
diseases. The child had fever of sudden onset, cough, coryza and enlarged
lymph nodes. These symptoms appeared 2 days before the onset of the rash.
From 27 Oct 2005 until 18 Nov 2005, an additional 18 suspected cases were
identified. All of the cases evolved well and no deaths were
reported. There has been no report of any new case since 18 Nov 2005.
Specimens were sent to the WHO Reference Center for Orthopoxvirus in CDC
Atlanta, USA. CDC Atlanta confirmed the Monkeypox infection on the samples
of the index case. They isolate the virus and found that it was related to
the DRC clade.

[ProMED-mail has learned from a reliable source that in fact there has been
continued monkeypox activity in Sudan, with cases continuing to occur in 2006.
Monkeypox has not previously been reported in Sudan. (A map of Sudan with
states is available at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/sudan.pdf>. Bentui can
be seen on this map in the south-central area of the country.)
Borrowing from my colleague Mod.CP's previous comments on a suspected
monkeypox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, "Human
infection with monkeypox virus has been reported in rural areas of the
tropical rain forests of west and central Africa, especially in the
Democratic Republic of Congo. The signs and symptoms are similar to those
of smallpox, with generalized pustular rash, fever, and toxemia. The
disease, which is rare, became apparent only after the eradication of
smallpox. Monkeypox virus is a zoonotic agent and is acquired by humans
through direct contact with the presumptive natural hosts: squirrels and
monkeys. Person-to-person transmission has been recorded, but the secondary
attack rate is low. Nonetheless, the fear has been expressed that monkeypox
might evolve to become an endemic human infection. Determination of the
complete sequence of the genome of monkeypox virus, however, has indicated
that monkeypox virus lacks some of the immunomodulatory genes possessed by
smallpox virus, which suggests that monkeypox virus is unlikely to become
endemic in the human population."
ProMED-mail would appreciate more information on this outbreak from
knowledgeable sources. - Mod.MPP]
