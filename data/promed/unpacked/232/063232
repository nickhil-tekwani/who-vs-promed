Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Ouaish Elhagar, Ouaish Elhagar, Bandar Elmansoura, Ad Daqahliyah [Dakahlia]
Date of start of the outbreak: 31 Dec 2018
Outbreak status: resolved on 1 Jan 2019
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 10 000 / 10 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: a duck farm has been investigated before slaughtering under routine activity of the national control strategy for HPAI control. The samples have been routinely withdrawn for slaughtering licensing noting that there were no clinical signs on the apparently healthy population. An epidemiological surveillance and sampling has been implemented around the infected farm in both backyard and farm sectors in a radius of 9 km [5.6 mi]. All results in surveillance zone were negative for HPAI.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed in percentages], expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 0.10 / 0 / 0 / 9.90
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability; quarantine; zoning; disinfection; process to inactivate the pathogenic agent in products or by-products; slaughter; no treatment of affected animals
Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)
Administrative division / Species / Total vaccinated /
Ad Daqahliyah [Dakahlia] / Birds / 45 914
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Animal Health Research Institute, Central Laboratory for Veterinary Quality Control on Poultry Production (national laboratory)

[This is the 1st report of highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza in Egypt. HPAI H5N1 and H9N2 are enzootic in the country, and, in addition, during 2016-17, HPAI H5N8 circulated in the country.

Avian influenza viruses are divided by subtype based on 2 proteins found in the viruses: a hemagglutinin, or "H" protein, and a neuraminidase, or "N" protein. There are 16 H types and 9 N types, yielding a total 144 possible combinations.

The H5 and H7 subtypes are of particular concern, because of their ability to mutate from low-pathogenic to highly pathogenic strains. These 2 H-types have been known to cause serious disease and mortality in domestic poultry and are commonly isolated from wild waterfowl (http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/fact-sheet/eng/1356193731667/1356193918453). - Mod.CRD
