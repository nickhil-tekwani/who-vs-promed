The [Philippines] Department of Agriculture (DA) has ordered the culling of hogs in an unidentified area to contain what could be the entry of the African swine fever (ASF) virus in the country. In a press conference on Monday [19 Aug 2019], agriculture secretary William Dar neither confirmed nor denied reports that the ASF virus has infected hogs raised in Rizal, but noted that the agency received an incident report on Friday [16 Aug 2019] "on an increased mortality of pigs raised by farmers in their backyards".

An industry source told the Inquirer that the infected area was Barangay San Isidro in Rizal, wherein agency officials have already commenced quarantine and security practices. According to the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) veterinarian Dr Joy Lagayan -- who is also a member of the ASF task force -- the usual mortality rate for pigs is between 3% and 5%. In this case, however, the mortality rate in the area has spiked to as much as 20%.

Dar said he has already directed BAI to conduct further confirmatory laboratory tests, including sending blood samples to foreign laboratories to ascertain the cause of the animals' deaths. The test results are expected in 2 to 3 weeks, although Dar said some confirmatory tests could take as much as 3 months.

Following this development, BAI has already put the area under a "quarantine zone", which means the automatic depopulation of all hogs within 1 km [about 0.6 mi] from the virus' ground zero and the further surveillance of areas within 10 km [about 6.2 mi]. Agriculture undersecretary Ariel Cayanan said the agency will be strictly monitoring the entry and exit of agricultural commodities in the area, while disinfection of the quarantine zone is currently under way. Dar, however, assured consumers that the incident would not affect the supply and prices of pork in the market, and stressed that the ASF virus does not pose any health concerns to humans.

Nonetheless, the epidemic has no cure yet and given the government's lack of resources to address the problem and ensure against its contamination, its entry in the country may destroy the P200-billion local livestock industry at a time when the latter has just secured trade agreements to supply pork to China and Singapore. "We have further upgraded our monitoring and vigilance, including the imposition of stricter quarantine measures all over the country's ports of entry, airports, and seaports," Dar said.

[The Philippines Province of Rizal is located on the country's largest island, Luzon, in the Calabarzon region, 16 km [about 10 mi] east of Manila; map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rizal#/media/File:Ph_locator_map_rizal.png.

According to the most recent available (2017) OIE official statistics available, the swine population of the Philippines is about 4.5 million adult pigs and 8.1 million backyard pigs.

The UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) listed, in its Early Warning Early Action Report on Food Security and Agriculture, released on 15 Apr 2019, several countries as being at ASF risk, "such as Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and the Philippines" (20190430.6449134). This prediction has already demonstrated its precision: the 3 1st countries on the list have already become seriously ASF-affected.

ASF diagnosis should take shorter than 3 weeks to be established; there are 3 OIE-recognised ASF reference laboratories globally: at Onderstepoort, South Africa; Madrid, Spain; and Pirbright in the UK. For the detailed diagnostic methods, as laid out in chapter 3.8.1 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, please visit https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.08.01_ASF.pdf (Version adopted May 2019).

Appropriate quarantine and biosecurity measures deserve to be applied immediately upon suspicion, their continuation pending upon confirmation or otherwise. - Mod.AS
