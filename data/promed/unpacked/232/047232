Cases of hemorrhagic fever were reported in an area of Congo that is facing an Ebola epidemic as far back as December [2017] and the 1st deaths were reported in January [2018], a spokesman for the World Health Organization said [Thu 10 May 2018], as 4 new suspected cases surfaced. ...

An interval of as long as 5 months since the 1st infection would give the virus time potentially to have infected many people before action was taken to contain it.

"According to our early information, the cases have been reported since December and the 1st deaths were reported in January [2018], but the link between the deaths and the epidemic has not yet been established," WHO Congo spokesman Eugene Kabambi told Reuters.

The health ministry said on [Thu 9 May 2018] it had dispatched a team of 12 experts to the area to try to trace new contacts of the disease, identify the epicenter and all affected villages and provide resources.

The epidemic so far appears to be centered around the village of Ikoko Impenge, near the town of Bikoro, where local health officials had reported 21 patients showing signs of hemorrhagic fever, of whom all but 4 of whom had died. ...

[It is not clear if the early cases in December 2017 and January 2018 were not recognized as Ebola and it took a cluster of cases to alert health care practitioners, or whether they were ignored. The delay in recognition or action is unfortunate, as time is of the essence in preventing spread.

The mortality rate stands at 17 deaths out of 21 cases, or 81 percent mortality if all cases are Ebola. Of course at this stage, the true denominator is not known and the numbers will change. - Mod.LK]

The World Health Organization (WHO) said today [10 May 2018] that the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Ebola virus outbreak has grown to 32 cases, 3 of them in health workers, as more responders arrive on the scene and as funding help comes from the United Kingdom.

Meanwhile, in the United States, news yesterday [9 May 2018] of the exit of one of the country's top global health officials, coming on the heels of President Trump's proposed rescission of earlier Ebola response funds, has deepened concerns about the nation's preparedness for an epidemic such as Ebola.

Outbreak developments
---------------------
In an update today [10 May 2018], the WHO said that, as of yesterday, a total of 32 Ebola cases have been reported, including 2 confirmed, 18 probable, and 12 suspected. 18 deaths are among the cases.

All of the illnesses are in the Bikoro health zone in the DRC's Equateur province and are from the area covered by the Ikoko-Impenge health facility, about 19 miles [about 31 km] from Bikoro's central health zone office.

Of 21 cases, 17 had epidemiologic links to other patients, the WHO said. It added that, of 8 previous Ebola outbreaks in the DRC, 4 occurred in Equateur province, though the new outbreak is the 1st to strike the Bikoro health zone. Home to about 163 000 people, Bikoro has 3 hospitals and 19 health centers, but most of them have limited service.

The WHO said it considers the risk within the DRC as high because of the nature of the disease and the lack of information about the scope of the outbreak. For the region, it said the risk is moderate because of the hot spot's location near the Congo River, which connects it to the capitals of the Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.

Yesterday [9 May 2018], the DRC's health ministry reported that 12 members of its expert team had arrived in Mbandka, the capital of Equateur province, to investigate the outbreak, identify contacts, and assess resources, according to a press release translated and posted by FluTrackers, an infectious disease news message board. The ministry said the multidisciplinary team will be supported by lab technicians who will move mobile labs from the National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) to the area.

The team also brought rapid diagnostic tests and laser thermometers, and health protection kits and medications were already in place in Mbandaka, the release said.

In a related development, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said yesterday [9 May 2018] that an emergency team is working with the DRC's health ministry and other international groups to assess and support a rapid response to the outbreak. It added that its team is based in the Bikoro health zone and in Kinshasa.

Julien Raickman, head of MSF's DRC mission, said in the statement that MSF has worked alongside Congolese official in the past to care for patients and help control outbreaks. "At the moment, there is an experienced MSF team in Bikoro, made up of medics, water and sanitation experts, health promoters, logisticians, and an epidemiologist," Raickman said. "The team is working with the national authorities and other international organizations to assess the situation and to ensure that the outbreak is contained."

Yesterday [9 May 2018], a WHO Ebola expert aired serious concerns about the DRC's latest Ebola outbreak, given signs that it may have been underway for weeks or months and that several locations may be involved, STAT [health news website] reported.

Pierre Formenty, DVM, MPH, also told STAT that though the outbreak is in a remote location, it is on a lake port that raises the worrying possibility of infected people traveling by boat via the Congo and Ubangi rivers to the large cities of Kinshasa, Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo, or Bangui in the Central African Republic. He added that the WHO is in talks with the DRC and Republic of Congo governments to set up a way to control boat traffic on the Congo River to identify any sick travelers.

Wellcome Trust, UK announce funds
---------------------------------
Wellcome Trust said today [10 May 2018] that it is making an initial USD 2.7 million (GBP 2 million) pledge to support a rapid response to the DRC's Ebola outbreak, and the UK's Department for International Development (DFID) said it is releasing USD 1.35 million (GBP 1 million) from a joint research initiative on epidemic preparedness that it operates with Wellcome Trust to support the rapid response.

In its statement, Wellcome Trust said the funding will help the DRC and WHO conduct critical research. Jeremy Farrar, MD, PhD, Wellcome's director, said, the group made the funds available immediately. "It's vital the global response to this outbreak is swift. We know from previous outbreaks that the DRC are ready to act, but they need global support to ensure this outbreak is contained effectively," he added.

The funds from Wellcome Trust and DFID come on top of USD 1 million [about GBP 740 000] that the WHO has already released from its emergency contingency fund. ...

[The Health Minister -- see below -- has advocated for the use of vaccination to protect the population and medical personnel in Bikoro health zone in the DRC's Equateur province. We hope this will be approved by the DR Congo and WHO will be able to ship a supply of the vaccine as soon as possible. The most likely candidate is the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine, which underwent clinical trials in West Africa. - Mod.LK

Oly Idriss Kabir [health minister], who held a press briefing on Thu 10 May at the government headquarters (Intelligence Building), justified the use of vaccination to protect the population and medical personnel who are overexposed in the response to this 9th Ebola epidemic affecting the DRC knows.

The minister has revealed that 3 health workers are already infected with the haemorrhagic fever. To protect them effectively, he decided to use the vaccine.

The vaccine is also to protect populations because the epicenter of this new epidemic is close to a large population area, according to the minister.

Apart from the vaccination, the Minister of Health also advocates the use of the entire diagnostic and therapeutic arsenal at the disposal of his ministry.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
From December 2013 to March 2016, West Africa experienced the largest Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak to date, leading to a European-wide activation of laboratory preparedness and response. At the end of the outbreak, laboratories associated with the 2 European preparedness networks of expert laboratories EMERGE JA and EVD-LabNet were invited to participate in an assessment of the response of European laboratories to the EBOV outbreak, to identify learning points and training needs to strengthen future outbreak responses. Response aspects assessed included diagnostics, biorisk management and quality assurance. The overall coverage of EBOV diagnostics in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) was found to be adequate although some points for quality improvement were identified. These included the need for relevant International Organization for Standardization (ISO) accreditation, the provision of EBOV external quality assessments (EQA) in periods where there is no emergency, facilitating access to controls and knowledge, biorisk management without compromising biosafety and a rapid public health response, and the need for both sustained and contingency funding for preparedness and response activities.

Comment on [3] WHO: fear of virus spread (https://www.statnews.com/2018/05/09/new-ebola-outbreak-congo-raises-who-concerns/)

I wonder whether deforestation, bushmeat, new roads, conflicts, and displacements may negate any traditional containment advantage related to an outbreak being located in a 'rural', as opposed to urban, area. The report [STAT News, 9 May 2018, by Helen Branswell] covers some of these issues.

[There is also] a new aspect, the possibility that Ebola could be a chronic or relapsing disease in humans. Might Ebola be transmissible as an asymptomatic chronic or latent disease? Is this what happens with the host species? See the following report:

Did deforestation cause the Ebola outbreak? [excerpt]
-----------------------------------------------------
Meliandou is a tiny, remote village in Guinea's Gueckedou Forest Region. By the time tragedy struck, in 2014, the region had been subject to extreme deforestation, caused by mining and lumber operations. Destroying the habitat of the animals that are natural carriers of the virus, such as the rainforest, makes interaction between these animals and humans more frequent, and viral transmission more likely, experts believe.

'Emerging diseases are linked to environmental alterations caused by humans. Humans are in much more contact with animals when you open up a forest,' says Professor John E Fa of Manchester Metropolitan University, a senior research associate with the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR). 'You have a balance of animals, viruses and bacteria and you alter that when you open up a forest.'

Places on the edge of rainforests are more prone to be involved in Ebola outbreaks. More specifically, scientists have recently discovered that an outbreak of Ebola is most likely to strike villages in Sub-Saharan Africa that are near areas that have experienced deforestation within the previous 2 years, a finding which could have profound implications for predicting outbreaks. There is also some suggestion that the likelihood of an outbreak may peak at 2 years after deforestation has taken place, although researchers are unclear what the mechanism for this is.

For the virus host animal, believed to be a certain type of bat, the Ebola sickness is much less grave than it is in humans. The virus has a comparative severity similar to that of chickenpox in human children.

Almost the entire population of the host species is thought to be exposed to it and while they develop some symptoms, they are able to mount an immune response and recover. As it does not kill off the host animal, this allows the virus to be transmitted elsewhere, says Dr Vincent Munster, Chief of the Virus Ecology Unit at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

A team of researchers published their results in the journal Nature last year [2017; see ref. 1 below]. There have been 40 Ebola outbreaks reported since 1976. Researchers were able to focus on 27 of those: where index cases (that is, the 1st patients, who indicate the existence of an outbreak) were identified and for which large-scale deforestation data were available over the period 2001-2014.

They found a link between recent deforestation and Ebola in 25 of these 27 cases. In addition to the 2014 West African outbreak, 16 of these were clustered around the border between Gabon and the Republic of Congo, in the western Congo basin between 2001 and 2005, and eight cases in Uganda and the east and south of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) after 2006. ...

How Ebola could make a comeback
-------------------------------
In a surprising twist, after the 2014 outbreak the virus re-emerged in 2 patients that had previously recovered from Ebola. One of the patients was Scottish nurse Pauline Cafferkey, who suffered a relapse of symptoms 9 months after she had recovered from the infection. This shocked Ebola experts and the medical community, as relapses had not been recorded in previous outbreaks.

'We had never before considered Ebola as a chronic or persistent disease,' says H Feldmann. Worryingly, in each occurrence of these relapse cases, the patient will be infectious again, which could lead to further cases of human-to-human transmission, potentially triggering another outbreak months or years later, Feldmann says.

[The idea that deforestation increases risk of transmission of Ebola virus and other zoonotic diseases is not new. While the exact mechanism is not known, among other reasons, it is likely that such activity brings humans and reservoir hosts into closer contact with each other.

Summary
-------
A new collaborative study has identified and studied Ebola antibodies that could be used to design universal therapeutics that are effective against many different Ebola species. The findings were recently published in Nature Microbiology [1].

The Ebola virus causes a severe illness with high mortality rates in humans. Several strategies have been developed to treat Ebola infection, including ZMapp, which has been shown to be effective in non-human primates and has been used under compassionate-treatment protocols in humans.

"The trouble with ZMapp is that although it is effective against the Ebola species that was largely responsible for the last Ebola outbreak, it does not neutralize other Ebola species, including [_Bundibugyo ebolavirus_, _Reston ebolavirus_, or _Sudan ebolavirus_]," said virologist Alex Bukreyev, co-senior author and a University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston professor in the department of pathology. "We identified and studied 3 naturally-occurring antibodies from human survivors of Bundibugyo virus that neutralize and protect against infection with the several different Ebola virus species."

The newly identified antibodies bond at a different site on the Ebola virus than other antibodies currently used to develop Ebola therapies. ...

Fortunately, ZMapp should be effective in the current outbreak, which appears to be _Zaire ebolavirus_. ]

Survivors of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have localized pathological changes in photoreceptors, according to a study published online 3 May 2018 in JAMA Ophthalmology [1].

PJ Steptoe (University of Liverpool, United Kingdom) and colleagues conducted a prospective case series study to describe the appearance of EVD retinal lesions. Ophthalmological images were analyzed from 14 EVD survivors with Ebola retinal lesions. Ultra-widefield imaging revealed a total of 141 Ebola retinal lesions in 22 of 27 eyes (81 percent) of the 14 survivors. ...

Ebola survivors from Sierra Leone frequently suffer from uveitis, or inflammation inside the eye, a condition that can result in vision loss or blindness.

Purpose of review
-----------------
This review provides a summary of our current understanding of the ophthalmic manifestations of Ebola virus disease (EVD), pathogenesis, treatment options and directions for future study. The individual, public health and global health implications of eye disease in EVD survivors are discussed.

Recent findings
--------------
The West Africa EVD outbreak was of unprecedented magnitude, leading to the largest survivor cohort since the 1st documented EVD outbreak in 1976. Because of the magnitude of the recent outbreak, thousands of survivors are at-risk of systemic and ophthalmic sequelae termed the 'post Ebola virus disease syndrome'. Uveitis is the most common finding during EVD convalescence and may lead to severe vision impairment or blindness in 40 percent of affected individuals. Ocular complications leading to vision loss include cataract, retinal scarring, optic neuropathy, hypotony, and phthisis bulbi [shrunken, collapsed globe of the eye]. The pathogenesis of eye disease in EVD survivors likely involves Ebola virus persistence, severe inflammation and tissue edema, which present as acute, rapidly progressive disease or chronic, smoldering disease. Further studies into disease pathogenesis including mechanisms of viral persistence may provide guidance into therapies for uveitis secondary to EVD.

Summary
-------
Uveitis is the most common ophthalmic finding in EVD survivors and can lead to vision loss. Further studies into the clinical manifestations and mechanisms of disease are needed to improve therapies for EVD survivors who often have limited access to ophthalmic medical and surgical care.
