A woman in her 60s from northern Minnesota has died from a brain
infection [presumed to be encephalitis] due to Powassan (POW) virus
infection. This is the 1st death in the state attributed to the
disease.

One other likely POW virus infection case has been identified this
year [2011] in Minnesota, in an Anoka County man in his 60s who was
hospitalized with a brain infection and is now recovering at home. POW
virus is transmitted through the bite of an infected tick.

Both 2011 cases became ill in May after spending time outdoors and
noticing tick bites. The fatal case was likely exposed to ticks near
her home. The case from Anoka County might have been exposed near his
home or at a cabin in northern Minnesota.

Health officials say this death serves as a reminder of the vital
importance of preventing tick bites.

"Although Powassan cases are rarely identified, it is a severe
disease which is fatal in about 10 percent of cases nationwide, and
survivors may have long-term neurological problems" said Dr Ruth
Lynfield, state epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health
(MDH).

"Powassan disease is caused by a virus and is not treatable with
antibiotics, so preventing tick bites is crucial."

In Minnesota, POW virus can be transmitted by the blacklegged tick
(also called the deer tick), which can also carry Lyme disease,
anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. The blacklegged tick is abundant during
our warm weather months in hardwood and mixed-hardwood forests of
Minnesota. When a tick infected with POW virus attaches to a person,
it might take only minutes of tick attachment for the virus to be
transmitted.

POW virus infection was first detected in Minnesota in 2008, in a
Cass County child who was exposed near home. In 2009-2010, 5
additional POW cases were identified in Minnesota. These cases were
likely exposed to infected ticks in north-central or east-central
counties (Cass, Carlton, Hubbard, Itasca, or Kanabec). In addition to
these human cases, MDH has found POW-infected ticks in northern
counties (Cass, Clearwater, and Pine) and in southeastern Minnesota
(Houston County).

POW virus was first described in 1958 in Powassan, Ontario. Since
then, about 60 cases have been identified in North America. Most of
these cases were from eastern Canada and the northeastern USA until
the last decade, when cases began to be reported from Michigan,
Wisconsin, and now Minnesota.

POW virus is related to West Nile virus (WNV). Like WNV, POW virus
can cause severe disease of the central nervous system, involving
inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or the lining of the brain
and spinal cord (meningitis). People with POW may have fever,
headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, loss of coordination, speech
difficulties, and memory loss. Signs and symptoms occur within 1 to 5
weeks of an infectious tick bite.

To prevent tick-borne diseases, always use tick repellents containing
DEET (up to 30 percent concentration) or permethrin when spending time
in tick habitat. Products with DEET can be used on the skin or
clothing. Permethrin-based products, which are only applied to
clothing, are highly effective and can last through several washings
and wearings. Also, wear long pants and light-colored clothing to help
detect and remove ticks before they've had time to bite. People with
homes or cabins near the woods can also use landscape management and
targeted pesticide applications to reduce exposure to disease-carrying
ticks.

After returning from outdoors, check your body carefully for ticks
and promptly remove any you find. The process of bathing or showering
shortly after returning indoors can help remove ticks before they bite
or before they've been attached for long.

The back end of the adult female blacklegged tick is reddish-orange
in appearance and teardrop-shaped. The nymph, or immature, stage of
the blacklegged tick is about the size of a poppy seed and
dark-colored. It is so small that it often goes unnoticed. When the
nymph is noticed, it is easily mistaken for a speck of dirt or small
freckle on people's skin. Blacklegged ticks are smaller and darker in
color than American dog ticks (also known as wood ticks). They also
lack the dog tick's characteristic white markings. To remove a tick,
use tweezers to grasp it by its head close to the skin and pull it out
gently and steadily.

[According to the Minnesota Department of Health website one type of
POW virus is carried by _Ixodes scapularis_ (known as the blacklegged
tick or deer tick), the same tick that transmits Lyme disease, human
anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. The blacklegged tick is common in many
wooded areas of north central, east central, and southeast Minnesota.

Another type of POW virus is carried by _Ixodes cookei_, a related
tick species that usually feeds on woodchucks or other medium-sized
mammals instead of humans. _I. cookei_ has also been found in wooded
areas in Minnesota.

A tick needs to be attached to a person for a certain length of time
before it can cause disease. Contrary to the information in the press
report above, this time interval is not known for POW virus, but it
may be shorter than the attachment time needed for Lyme disease (24-48
hours) or anaplasmosis (12-24 hours).

The website includes a scaled illustration of adults and a nymph of
the blacklegged tick vector of Powassan virus.
