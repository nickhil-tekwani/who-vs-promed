Telluride Parks and Rec Public Works Project Manager Karen
Guglielmone reported Monday [26 Apr 2010] that 2 of the 4 beavers
found dead in Telluride's Beaver Pond last week [week of 19 Apr 2010]
have tested positive for tularemia.

Town officials have alerted the Telluride Veterinary Clinic and the
Telluride Medical Center to the outbreak of the disease, more
commonly known as "rabbit fever" or "deer fly fever," which can be
transmitted to animals and humans, most frequently by ticks and deer flies.

Town residents reported the beaver deaths to authorities last week
[week of 19 Apr 2010], following earlier reports that, despite the
warm temperatures, no beavers had been sighted in the pond.

Guglielmone estimated as many as 8 beavers could have been living in
the Beaver Pond lodge, where it's possible more dead beavers will be found.

"You never really know," she said, of the pond's resident beaver
population, adding that beaver "kits" may remain with their parents
for up to 2 years, before moving on.

"It's like losing a neighbor," she said, of the dead beavers.

Humans and animals can catch tularemia, but it is "easily treated
with antibiotics" like tetracycline, Guglielmone said. She
emphasized, however, that "if you see a dead rodent, don't pick it up
-- or turn it over. If there is a cut on your arm, you risk getting infected."

The disease, most often found in rabbit and hare populations, is
endemic in North America, parts of Europe, and Asia; believed to have
been introduced into the US in the late 19th or early 20th century,
possibly by dogs, it was first isolated in Tulare, California.

Tularemia is generally transmitted via rodents and insects -- biting
flies, which can remain infective for up to 2 weeks, and ticks, which
can remain infective for up to 2 years, although waterborne infection
accounts for 5-10 percent of all cases in the US.

Tularemia can also be spread by direct contact with contaminated
animals or material, by ingestion of poorly cooked flesh of infected
animals or contaminated water, or by inhalation. The incubation
period for tularemia is 1 to 14 days, with most infections in humans
manifesting in 3 to 5 days.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, symptoms of tularemia
in humans can include sudden fever, chills, headaches, diarrhea,
muscle aches, joint pain, a dry cough, and progressive weakness;
human victims can also develop pneumonia, chest pain, bloody sputum,
and breathing difficulties. Depending on the vector of exposure, more
symptoms can include ulcers on the skin or mouth, swollen and painful
lymph glands, swollen and painful eyes, and a sore throat. Humans can
get tularemia by being bitten by an infected tick, deer fly, or other
insect, handling infected animal carcasses, eating or drinking
contaminated food and water, and breathing in the bacteria.

The CDC reports that, while tularemia is not known to be spread from
person to person, anyone with the disease should be treated as soon
as possible, since it can be fatal if not treated with antibiotics. A
vaccine for tularemia under review by the Food and Drug
Administration is not currently available in the US. They recommend
using insect repellent "containing DEET on the skin, and treating
clothing with permethrin to prevent insect bites, as well as frequent
hand-washing with soap and warm water, especially after handling
animal carcasses; cooking food thoroughly and only drinking water
from a safe source." It also recommends those in affected areas note
any change in the behavior of pets (most particularly in rodents,
rabbits, and hares) or livestock, and consulting a veterinarian if
symptoms appear.

The CDC's website further reports that, if the _Francisella
tularensis_ [the causative organism of Tularemia - Mod.TG] organism
"were used as a weapon, the bacteria would likely be made airborne
for exposure by inhalation. People who inhale an infectious aerosol
would generally experience severe respiratory illness, including
life-threatening pneumonia and systemic infection, if not treated.
The bacteria that cause tularemia occur widely in nature, and could
be isolated and grown in quantity in a laboratory, although
manufacturing an effective aerosol weapon would require considerable
sophistication," to which end it is working to stockpile antibiotics
for treatment of infected persons, and to coordinate a nationwide
program through which states share information about tularemia and
creating new education tools and programs for health professionals,
the public, and the media.

Warning signs about the disease will be posted at the beaver pond;
dog owners are urged to keep their animals away from the area.

[Tularemia results from infection by _Francisella tularensis_
(formerly known as _Pasteurella tularensis_), a Gram negative,
non-motile coccobacillus. 2 subspecies exist: _F. tularensis
tularensis_ (also known as Jellison type A) and _F. tularensis
holarctica_ (Jellison type B). _F. tularensis tularensis_ is found in
lagomorphs in North America and is highly virulent for humans and
domestic rabbits; _F. tularensis holarctica_ is less virulent and
occurs in beavers, muskrats, and voles in North America and in hares
and small rodents in Eurasia.

_F. tularensis_ can be transmitted by ingestion, inhalation,
arthropod-borne transfer, or direct contact through the skin and
mucous membranes. Organisms are found in the blood and tissues of
infected animals and can survive for long periods on fomites
including food and water. Aquatic animals may develop tularemia after
being immersed in contaminated water. Carnivores sometimes become
infected after ingesting a contaminated carcass. Vectors for _F.
tularensis tularensis_ include ticks (including _Dermacentor
andersoni_, _D. variabilis_, and _Amblyomma americanum_) and biting
flies (particularly deerflies). _F. tularensis holarctica_ is also
transmitted by mosquitoes in Russia. Rarely, the organism is spread
by animal bites.

_F. tularensis_ can survive for long periods in arthropod vectors and
in the environment. Individual flies may carry the organism for 2
weeks and ticks throughout their lifetimes. Viable bacteria can also
be found for weeks to months in the carcasses and hides of infected
animals and in fomites including grain dust, straw, water, soil, and
bedbugs. This organism is highly resistant to freezing; live
organisms have been found after 3 years in rabbit meat stored at -15
deg C (5 deg F).

Rabbits and other wild rodents are the primary species affected.
Tularemia can also affect beaver and muskrats. Livestock and pets
including pigs, horses, dogs, cats, fish, and birds can also get
tularemia. Sheep are especially susceptible. Cattle rarely get the disease.

Some animals do not show signs of disease. Illness occurs 1-10 days
after exposure to the bacteria. Animals may have fever, look tired,
be depressed, and refuse to eat. Some will have a cough, stagger from
weakness, vomit, or develop diarrhea. Rabbits and rodents behave
strangely, huddle together, and have a rough looking coat. Sudden
death can occur.

Tularemia bacteria can be found in the organs or body fluids of
infected animals, which contaminates the environment. The bacteria
can live for long periods of time (weeks to months) in soil,
vegetation and water and serve as a source of infection for other
animals or humans. Animals get tularemia by ingesting (oral)
contaminated food (raw meat from infected animals) or drinking
contaminated water. They can also inhale (aerosol) the bacteria, have
direct contact with it in contaminated environments (entry through
the mucous membranes or breaks/cuts in the skin), or be bitten by
infected biting flies or ticks (vector).

Tularemia is difficult to prevent since it can be in the environment
or be spread by insects. Prevention measures include keeping pets
indoors and away from wildlife. Do not feed animals raw meat,
especially that from wild animals. Control ticks and biting flies.

Lastly, this agent is a category A bioterrorism agent.
