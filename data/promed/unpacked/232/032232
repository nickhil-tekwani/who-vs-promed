Health officials are investigating an increase in reports of Legionnaires'
Disease in Los Angeles County, especially in the Westside and South Bay.
There have been 26 confirmed this year, compared to 12 cases confirmed in
1996, said Dr. James Haughton of the Department of Health Services. And
Haughton added that the number of confirmed cases may not be the full story:
"There may be cases we do not know about."
In addition to the usual source of the Legionnaire's bacterium, heating and
cooling systems, Haughton said that the mist used by grocery stores to keep
produce fresh may also be a source.

[This report appears to be describing an increased annual incidence of
legionellosis in this location, rather than an ongoing outbreak. We would
appreciate information about known links among the 26 patients and
identities of enviromental source(s) of the etiologic agent. - Mod.ES
