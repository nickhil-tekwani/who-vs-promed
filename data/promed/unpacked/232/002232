Newton County Sheriff's deputies are trying to figure out exactly how
2 raccoons got inside a home to attack a 9-month-old baby that was
sleeping in a crib in the same room as her mother. The baby is in
critical condition in an Atlanta hospital and has to be vaccinated
for rabies, WSB Radio is reporting.

Deputies went to the Brook Hollow Way home around 4 a.m. Wednesday [3
Nov 2010] after the mother called 911 to say that her little girl had
been bitten by a pair of raccoons, Lt. Tyrone Oliver said.

The baby, who had been bitten severely on her head and other parts of
her body, was taken to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston,
where she remains in critical condition, Oliver said.

The raccoons were outside the family's house when deputies arrived,
Oliver said. One became aggressive and was shot twice by a deputy,
Oliver said. That raccoon ran away, and authorities do not know
whether it was rabid, authorities told WSB Radio. The other raccoon
tested negative for rabies, WSB Radio said.

Oliver said Wednesday's [3 Nov 2010] case is an isolated incident.
"It's very disturbing," he told the AJC. "In my 12 years here, I
never came across a case of a 9-month-old sleeping in her crib in the
room with her mother and then being attacked. It's very sad."

Oliver said deputies are investigating whether the family was keeping
them in the home and treating them as pets.

"We're looking into that and determining whether that's true," he
said. Charges are pending, if that is the case, he said.

<http://www.lex18.com/news/toddler-faces-rabies-shots-after-being-bitten-by-dog>


A romp in the park turned into a painful situation for a 3-year-old
Lexington girl when she was bitten by a dog. Now, the child is facing
a series of painful rabies shots because her family can't find the
owner of the dog to see if it has been vaccinated [against rabies].

The victim plays at Waveland on a regular basis. The park-like
setting is popular for people and pets. On 22 Oct 2010, the little
girl came face to face with a little white Maltese dog on a leash.
The dog bit the victim's neck. It wasn't a bad bite, but it broke her
skin. Her mother says a lady with long brown hair and possibly in her
40's or 50's was walking the dog on a leash with another Maltese.

"The lady from a distance yells, 'Is she okay?,'" said the victim's
mother. "I said, 'I'm looking at her now.'" When the mother saw that
her daughter had been bitten, she tried to get information on the
dog's vet records, but says no one could find the woman.

The mother says the Fayette County Health Department sent her a
letter recommending the little girl get a series of rabies shots for
her own protection. The shots are painful, and the mother hopes she
can track down the owner of the dog to provide vet records so her
daughter doesn't have to go through the shots.

"I don't want your name," the mother said about the owner of the dog.
"I just the records, so my daughter doesn't have to get those shots.
She's just so young."

[3] Skunk, canine - North Carolina

Last week, a skunk found in Efland tested positive for rabies at the
State Laboratory of Public Health.

The skunk was submitted after a resident in the vicinity of High Rock
Road and Maple Avenue found her dog barking at the skunk in her yard.
The resident brought the dog inside with her other dog while she
contacted Animal Control.

Both dogs were currently vaccinated against rabies and received
rabies booster shots within 72 hours of exposure, which is required
under North Carolina law. Animals exposed to rabies that have not
been vaccinated or do not receive rabies boosters within 72 hours
must either be destroyed or quarantined for 6 months.

So far this year [2010], Orange County has received 6 positive rabies tests.

The Rowan County Animal Control reported the 12th and 13th rabies
cases, one involving human exposure and a dog.

The agency reported the 12th case of rabies on 8 Oct 2010. The victim
on Erskine Drive, China Grove told investigators a bat was inside his
home, but he had no idea how it entered. Animal Control removed the
bat, due to risk of human exposure and submitted it for rabies testing.

The bat was sent for testing 11 Oct 2010 and found to be positive for
rabies. Hess was advised to consult his physician to discuss post
exposure vaccinations.

The 13th case occurred 25 Oct 2010 when a victim on Safrit Road,
Salisbury reported he'd found a dead raccoon near his 2 dogs. One of
the 2 dogs was current on its rabies vaccinations, but the other, a
male Labrador named Buddy, was not. Buddy was held in quarantine
pending notification of the test results to determine if the raccoon was rabid.

On 27 Oct 2010, Animal Control reported the raccoon did in fact test
positive for rabies. Buddy was later euthanized.

A dog has been euthanized after fighting with a rabid fox, Rowan
County, North Carolina Animal Control said.

The fox is the 17th confirmed case of rabies in Rowan this year
[2010]. John Kale reported Wednesday [17 Nov 2010] that his pit
bull-boxer mix, Chord, had attacked a fox on his property on Wheaton
Court off Mooresville Road.

A neighbor later shot and killed the fox. Chord, not current on his
rabies vaccination, was quarantined at the Rowan Animal Shelter. Test
results received Thursday [18 Nov 2010] confirmed the fox had rabies.

The Guilford County Department of Public Health is alerting residents
that a raccoon found on Stokes Street in the Hunter Hills community
of Greensboro tested positive for the rabies virus. The rabid raccoon
had contact with one dog. This is the 13th case of animal rabies in
Guilford County this year [2010].

North Carolina law requires that all domestic pets (dogs, cats and
ferrets) be vaccinated against rabies and that their vaccinations are
kept current. This law still applies even if pets are exclusively
kept indoors. Barnyard pets such as goats, horses and cows should
also be vaccinated against rabies for their protection against this
deadly virus.

Rabies continues to circulate within our wildlife population even as
the weather gets colder and fewer wild animals are actually seen. For
your family and pet's safety as well as the safety of others,
vaccinate your pets against rabies.

For more information on educational programs available, please
contact the Guilford County Animal Control at 641-5990 or visit

A woman will be undergoing rabies treatment the next few weeks after
a weekend attack involving several raccoons. Alameda County Vector
Control also is ramping-up its investigation into aggressive wildlife
on the island after the latest raccoon attack, the 7th reported since
June 2010. All incidents involved people walking their small dogs.

The 33-year-old victim said she was walking her 20-pound Yorkshire
terrier Dougie around 11 p.m. Sunday [7 Nov 2010] along Central
Avenue toward Eighth Street. Dougie began barking uncontrollably when
the victim spotted "a pair of eyes" near the fence lining the
baseball diamond at Washington Park.

"I was trying to calm the dog down and saw the raccoon walking toward
us. Then I saw 4 more run down from the trees, and I started to run
as fast as I could, dragging the dog," recalled the victim, who
tripped while trying to get away. "My dog was barking, trying to
fight them off, and I was trying to protect my face while on the
ground. I was wearing long pants and a jacket, my face was the only
thing exposed."

One raccoon grabbed onto her right leg and bit her. "It wasn't a
terrible bite. Not super painful, but it was a puncture on my leg,"
she said. "The raccoons were huge. Definitely bigger than my dog, and
I definitely felt outnumbered. There was a lot of snarling and
barking. They were going after each other for sure. I was terrified."
She got to her feet and ran home. She hailed a patrolling police
officer who took a report. She was treated for her injuries at Kaiser
in Walnut Creek. Dougie suffered a few scratches, but nothing serious
[and at least one bite to her right leg - Mod.TG].

Alameda County Vector Control Officer David Gould said there were
raccoon paw marks around some garbage cans and "too much food equals
too many animals. When there is more food than territory and wildlife
is fighting for space, they're going to get pretty ornery," Gould
said. "I don't have an answer for what's going on other than Alameda
is an island and raccoons crowd together for food; you get too many of them."

He added, "it's a mater of enforcing garbage laws, really. Garbage
should be covered. I would appreciate the garbage ordinance being a
bit more enforced, because I think it's the root of the problem.
People think the animals are the root of the problem, but it's the
environmental conditions," Gould said. "And if you don't address
those, it's like digging a hole in water."

There has never been a reported case of a raccoon with rabies in
Alameda County, according to Vector Control. Rabies shots treatment
is used as a precautionary measure if the skin has been broken.

All the reported incidents involved small dogs barking when they
encountered a raccoon, triggering the wild animal's response to attack.

[This article does not tell us if the victim's dog was vaccinated
against rabies or what became of the dog. Although it is an island,
and the raccoons are protecting the garbage can food, there no reason
to assume that rabies has not entered the island. - Mod.TG]

Seven people are undergoing vaccine treatment after a rabid cat found
in a Princeton neighborhood tested positive for rabies.

The Mercer County Health Department said Monday [22 Nov 2010] that 6
people who were scratched, bitten or touched by the cat began
treatment last week.

Melody Rickman with the health department told the Bluefield Daily
Telegraph that another person was exposed to another animal that may
have had contact [with the same cat - Mod.TG]. That person sought
treatment Sunday [21 Nov 2010] after reading about the cat in the newspaper.

Rickman says it's the 7th rabies case in Mercer County this year
[2010]. The other rabid animals were a skunk, one fox and 4 raccoons.

[Kudo's to North Carolina, as their reporting of rabies incidents is
increasing. Hopefully, the word is getting out that rabies is serious
and fatal to humans and pets of all sizes. Hopefully, people are
beginning to see that rabies occurs in cities, towns and rural areas.
So, the key word is vaccination! - Mod.TG]
