New case of 'Mad cow' disease detected in France February 8, 1998 Agence
France-Presse [edited.
This latest case, the first ever in the Haute Savoie region of SE France,
is the second reported this year in France and brings to 33 the number of
cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) recorded in the country
since 1990. The last case was reported in January in the northern Manche
region.
An Agriculture Ministry spokesman said the entire herd from which the
infected cow came would be destroyed, adding that additional information
would be provided on Monday.
According to a European Commission report delivered to the European
parliament at the beginning of the month, 13 of the 15 European Union
members countries have yet to implement EU regulations on heat treatment
for bone meal, suspected of spreading the disease. Paris has stated its
intention to implement the EU directive. According to the Commission
report, only Finland and, to a lesser extent, Germany have applied the
rules set in July 1996.

The French new case of 'mad cow' disease was detected in the "department"
of Savoie, in Rhone-Alpes. The cow was born in 1988 on a farm in Haute-Savoie.

[If one assumes speculatively that this animal was infected as a calf/young
heifer then it was a matter of luck that it survived in the herd to become
ill at 9 years of age. Most dairy cows are culled after their 3rd-4th
lactation; pure bred beef cows may last a few years longer but not
cross-breds. The circumstances of this case should be illuminating. -
