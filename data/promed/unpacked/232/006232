Track officials announced Thursday [31 Jan 2019] they have quarantined Barn 3 at Gulfstream Park after an unidentified horse tested positive for equine infectious anemia, or swamp fever, as it is commonly known.

Gulfstream Park general manager Bill Badgett said all remaining horses in the barn have tested negative for local veterinarians, although all must pass similar testing administered by representatives from the Division of Animal Industry for the state Department of Agriculture before they can be entered to run. The results of those tests were expected late this week.

Badgett said that, to his knowledge, this is the 1st case of swamp fever (equine infectious anemia) reported at a racetrack in South Florida since 1977.

All horses in Barn 3 must train at a specially designated time after the rest of the general population, from approximately 10-11 a.m. EST daily, until the quarantine is lifted, which could take at least 2 weeks, "if not longer," according to Dr. Robert O'Neil, director of equine health and safety for The Stronach Group.

Bob Hess, Anthony D'Angelo, Alan Iwinski, and Troy Wismer are among the trainers stabled in Barn 3.

"We are working closely with Dr. William Fish, bureau chief for the Bureau of Disease Control for the Florida Department of Agriculture, whose staff is on the grounds and have been very professional, very hands-on, helping us to assure the safety of every horse on the grounds in light of this development," O'Neil said. "Although horses from Barn 3 will be permitted to race once testing negative, keeping them quarantined during training hours for the time being is a procedure that has proven successful in other areas affected by the same disease. So, while these horses could safely return to train with the general population, we have decided to err on the side of caution and stick with a tried-and-true procedure, since the safety of our horses remains the number-one priority of The Stronach Group."

[Unfortunately, there is no vaccine for this disease. It is a very sad disease, and, in most states, regulated with strict quarantine issued for the life of the horse, or euthanasia. Perhaps we will have a vaccine someday, or dare we dream for no insects capable of transmitting this and other diseases?

"Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a non-contagious, infectious disease of horses and other Equidae. It is caused by an RNA virus classified in the _Lentivirus_ genus, family Retroviridae. EIA can present as an acute, subacute, or chronic infection. On occasion, the virus can be a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. The most frequently encountered form of the disease is the unapparent, chronically infected carrier." This chronic carrier state is the reason for some of the regulations when equids go to a show or event or are shipped for any reason.

"Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of EIA is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily bloodborne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and, to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host-defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal.

"No specific treatment or safe and effective vaccine is available. Because equids infected with EIA virus present the only known source of infection, antibody-positive animals should be kept at a safe distance (around 200 m [219 yd]) from other equids. The only recognized exception to this rule is the progeny of seropositive mares, which may possess maternal antibodies to the virus after ingesting colostrum. In most cases, passive antibody against EIA virus wanes and is no longer detectable in the Coggins test by 6-8 months of age; detectable antibody may persist up to 12 months, however, if ELISA testing is used."
