STATEMENT OF MAFF ON BSE: 3 DECEMBER 1997
The first priority of this Government is protection of the consumer. I am
making this announcement in response to the latest advice from the
Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), which met yesterday, 2
December, and to outline the action which I intend to take on a strictly
precautionary basis.
Madam Speaker, I shall be publishing SEACs advice in full, and a copy has
been placed in the Library of the House.
SEAC has reviewed new evidence which will be published in the scientific
literature in due course. This evidence has emerged from an experiment
designed to re-check which parts of cattle may contain BSE infectivity.
Under these experimental conditions, in which animals were fed large doses
of BSE by mouth, my scientists have found infectivity in nervous tissues
called the dorsal root ganglia which lie within the bones of the spinal
column and would be left with the bone when meat is cut off the spine.
The dorsal root ganglia are not currently covered by the specified bovine
material (SBM) restrictions.
Further new findings which are still being evaluated indicate that
infectivity may also be found in the bone marrow in cattle which are at a
very late stage of disease and are already showing clinical symptoms.
In both cases the experimental animals showed the infectivity only at ages
over 30 months (above which all cattle are excluded from the food chain and
destroyed under the Over Thirty Month Scheme) and only after receiving a
heavy dose of infected bovine tissue. In any case consumers would not
normally eat dorsal root ganglia as such. Muscle, meat and blood are
tested at every stage of the same experiments. To date all results have
been negative.
SEAC has emphasised that the risk is very small. The committee has
suggested that there are three possible alternative courses of action.
First, to make public the research findings, together with their assessment
of the risk, and to leave individual consumers to choose what precautions
to take.
Second, to require that no beef with the bone in from cattle over 6 months
old should be sold to the consumer.
Third to require that cattle slaughtered between 24 and 30 months of age
for human consumption should be deboned under official control by the Meat
Hygiene service in licensed plants.
Taking account of the views of the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Kenneth
Calman, who advises me on these matters, I have concluded that I should
take further action. It would not be acceptable to allow tissues shown to
transmit BSE to remain within the human food chain.
I will therefore be consulting as rapidly as possible with consumers and
the industry on proposals to implement the second of the options indicated
by SEAC: de-boning of all beef, whether from home supplies or imported,
coming from cattle over 6 months old before it is sold to the consumer.
It is helpful that, currently, only about 5% of beef is consumed on the
bone. The proposals would allow de-boning to take place in cutting
plants, butchers' shops, catering establishments or other commercial
premises but would not allow the bones to be sold, given to consumers or
used in the preparation of food. That is in line with SEAC advice on this
point.
This action, which is being taken on a precautionary basis, will ensure
that UK consumers continue to be given the highest protection possible
against the risks from BSE, while we press ahead with our determined action
to eradicate this disease completely from our cattle herd.
I know that this announcement will come as a further disappointment to our
beef producers. My message to them is that this Government is acting
firmly and rapidly to protect consumer confidence, which is in the
fundamental interests of the beef industry. We are maintaining a high
level of support through the Over Thirty Month Scheme, direct aid and other
measures, worth nearly Â£1.5 billion this year.
