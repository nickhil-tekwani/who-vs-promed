[1] Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa): human, dog, vaccine shortage, update

Most hospitals across the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) are facing a shortage of rabies vaccine despite the alarming increase in the number of dog-bite cases in the region.

The incidents of dog bites have been on the rise in Peshawar district too for the past couple of months which is a major cause of concern for the general public and Health Department alike.

In the past 2 months, 482 cases of dog bites were reported in the Peshawar district alone. After the incidents were reported at an increased pace, the Health Department was forced to take action and got 4042 doses of rabies vaccine to deal with the situation. Still, hospitals across the province are facing a shortage of rabies vaccines for the past year.

Talking to The Express Tribune an official of the Health Department said that an average of 40 000 cases of dog bites were reported to them each year and in 2020 around 18 825 incidents took place in the 1st 6 months of the year alone.

"Due to the lack of vaccines in the far-flung districts, people are forced to come to Peshawar. That is why there has been an increase in the number of patients in hospitals in Peshawar. This is putting an extra burden on the district Health Department in Peshawar," he said.

"In April [2021], 180 people sought rabies vaccine and in May their number increased to 302. During the same period 4 cases of rat-bite, 16 cases of cat-bite, 4 cases of jackal-bite, and 2 cases of donkey bite were also reported.

All these people were vaccinated," he said, adding that in Peshawar, Gulbahar and Landy Sarak are on top of the list where most dog-bite cases are being reported.

There is no policy to reduce the number of stray dogs in the cities and suburbs as whenever their culling is started animal rights activists also start a campaign against it thus the number of stray dogs has been on the rise in Peshawar and other large cities of the province.

There are reports of mismanagement too in the vaccination process. Patients blame that the 1st dose is administrated in the hospitals and for the second dose they are sent to the Health Department which is a time-consuming process.

They demanded of the government to take notice of it and make sure the availability of rabies vaccines with complete doses at all the hospitals in district and tehsil level.

[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa often abbreviated as K-P, formerly known as the North-West Frontier Province, is one of the 4 provinces of Pakistan. For a map of the Peshawar district, see https://tinyurl.com/4xpfdczx.

The following recent (May 2021) letter to the editor (ref 1) is applicable:
"Unfortunately, rabies is considered poor men's disease in Pakistan, despite the fact that it leads to 2000-5000 deaths annually. Recently, an upward trend has been noted, but the disease burden remains grossly underestimated as cases go unreported.

"Lack of awareness in the community remains one of the biggest challenges faced by the country in its fight against rabies. A majority of victims do not take dog bites seriously and a delay in seeking post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) results in increased mortality.

"Until 2015, the nerve tissue vaccine was being used as PEP all over Pakistan, which had devastating side effects and led to an increase in anti-vaccination sentiment in the population. It is necessary to establish a comprehensive rabies education programme, which increases awareness amongst the Pakistani population, particularly low socioeconomic communities. It is imperative to educate the masses regarding the fatality of the disease and the importance of PEP.

"Pre-exposure prophylaxis should be emphasised amongst the high-risk population, such as laboratory staff workers, animal handlers, and inhabitants of rural areas, who indulge in outdoor activities.

"Seeking early medical intervention should be promoted along with encouraging proper wound care and washing, followed by vaccine administration. The use of home remedies such as chili powder and oils should be strictly discouraged.

"Pakistan was previously importing anti-rabies vaccine (ARV) from India, but due to increasing tension between the 2 countries, we are facing an acute shortage of ARV since 2019. The National Institute of Health (NIH) has been unable to produce enough ARV to meet local demands.

"Currently, most rabies centres in Pakistan use the 5-dose IM [intramuscular] regime. It is necessary to train healthcare workers to administer vaccines intradermally to increase cost-effectiveness and patient compliance.

"Since dogs are considered inessential for economic growth, their existence is ignored and canine population control is neglected.

"Mass culling is still practised but fails, as it does not provide an effective long-term solution to the problem. WHO recommendations suggest mass dog vaccination and neutering to establish herd immunity.

"Some South-East Asian countries have successfully reported a decline in canine rabies by following this approach.

"In order to meet the goal of rabies eradication by 2030, prompt action needs to be taken at all levels of government, health departments, and community. Using the One Health model, a comprehensive national programme is required; one that will be responsible for creating a registry for collecting, reporting, and sharing of data. It should actively support the sampling of infected animals and seek funding for the cause. It would also be responsible for training dog catchers and vaccinators. It is only with unanimous effort, inter-sectorial, and inter-regional collaboration that we may hope to meet our goal of a rabies-free Pakistan by 2030."

Authorities in Thailand have reported a human rabies death in Surin province in lower northeastern Thailand, according to the Thai news source, Sanook.

The 39-year-old woman looked after 12 cats and 2 dogs. She took in a stray cat that subsequently died. The report doesn't note whether the patient ever received rabies post-exposure prophylaxis.

She started demonstrating symptoms of rabies on 7 May [2021] and died on 15 May [2021] soon after she was laboratory diagnosed.

This is the 1st rabies death reported in Thailand [in 2021], according to the Thailand Bureau of Epidemiology.

In 2020, 3 cases and deaths were reported.

[On 25-26 Sep 2019, researchers, government officials, and related stakeholders met at an IABS (International Alliance for Biological Standardization) conference in Bangkok, Thailand, to engage on the topic of human rabies mediated by dogs. The objective of the meeting was focused upon snowballing efforts towards achieving substantial progress in rabies prevention, control, and elimination within Asia by 2030, and thereby safeguarding the Pacific region.

[3] Tunisia (Zaghouan): dog, sheep exposed

The head of the Department of the regional veterinary services of Zaghouan, Areej Jamal, announced today, Tue 1 Jun 2021, the registration of a new animal rabies outbreak in Bir Halima in the governorate of Zaghouan, which is the 3rd outbreak that has been registered since the beginning of this year [2021].

Doctor Jamal said in a statement to the Tunisia African Press Agency that this outbreak was discovered after a dog owned by a sheep breeder was contaminated with this disease from stray dogs, which in turn transmitted it by biting a sheep owned by the same breeder.

She added that the veterinary services, in coordination with the security services, killed all the dogs that had been in contact with the infected dog.

The same interests took the same procedure with regard to the suspected sheep, placing the rest of the herd under quarantine and veterinary monitoring, as well as subjecting a number of citizens of the region to post-exposure prophylaxis.

The head of the department indicated that during the past months of 2021, 2 outbreaks of rabies were discovered in the areas of Muqrin and Bir Halima.

[Although there are specific regulations for rabies control and a national rabies control program, launched in 1982, the disease remains enzootic in Tunisia. This program calls for collaboration between 3 ministries: the Ministry of Public Health (population awareness/education and post-exposure prophylaxis in humans); the Ministry of Agriculture (veterinary services for free, mass vaccination of carnivores, and surveillance/monitoring programs in animals); and the Ministry of the Interior (dog population management and landfills management).

For animals and humans, the main reservoir and vector of the virus is the dog. Mass vaccination of dogs is the most effective strategy for preventing rabies in humans.

In 2021, 4 human cases of rabies have been registered in Tunisia. - Mod.SF
