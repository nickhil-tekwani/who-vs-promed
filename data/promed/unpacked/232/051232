Residents die of hemorrhagic fever in Tursunzoda District
---------------------------------------------------------
A total of 3 residents of the Tursunzoda District, some 60 kilometres
[37.3 miles] west of Dushanbe, have died of hemorrhagic fever,
Asia-Plus has learned from Azamjon Mirzoyev, Deputy Health Minister
and Tajikistan Head Sanitary Physician.

The Deputy Minister said that the victims were 2 brothers, aged 50
and 47, from the village of Ziyoratut and the 47-year-old head of the
infectious Diseases Department within the local central district
hospital who died yesterday. According to the Deputy Minister the 1st
case of the disease was reported in the village of Ziyoratut on 27
Jul 2009. "Up to the present, 5 persons have been diagnosed with
hemorrhagic fever and 3 of them died," said. Mirzoyev. "24 persons
that were in contact with those who contracted the disease are
currently under the care of physicians. Antiepidemic measures have
been taken in Ziyoratut." No new cases of hemorrhagic fever have been
reported so far, he added.

The viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a diverse group of animal and
human illnesses that are caused viruses classified in 5 different
families of RNA viruses: the _Arenaviridae_, _Filoviridae_,
_Bunyaviridae_, _Togaviridae_, and _Flaviviridae_. All types of VHF
are characterized by fever and bleeding disorders and all can
progress to high fever, shock and death in extreme cases. Some of
the VHF agents cause relatively mild illnesses, such as the
Scandinavian nephropathia epidemica, while others, such as the
African Ebola virus, can cause severe, life-threatening disease.

The _Arenaviridae_ include the viruses responsible for Lassa fever
and Argentine, Bolivian and Venzuelan hemorrhagic fever. The
_Bunyaviridae_ include the members of the genus _Hantavirus_ that
cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus classified in the genus _Nairovirus_,
and Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus classified in the genus
_Phlebovirus_. Ebolavirus and marburgvirus are included in the family
_Filoviridae_. The family _Flaviviridae_ includes dengue, yellow
fever, and 2 viruses in the tick-borne encephalitic group Omsk
hemorrhagic fever virus and Kyasanur Forest disease virus.

[The Republic of Tajikistan is a mountainous landlocked country in
Central Asia. Afghanistan borders it to the south, Uzbekistan to the
west, Kyrgyzstan to the north, and People's Republic of China to the
east. The Tursunzoda District and the city of Dushanbe can be located
using the HealthMap/PoME-mail interactive map of Tajikistan at:
<http://healthmap.org/r/00Fa>.

The above report does not identify the etiologic agent. Of the
hemorrhagic fevers listed in the report, the most likely agents
responsible for hemporrhagic fever in this part of the world are one
of the tick-transmitted hantaviruses responsible for HFRS or
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. The high case-fatality ratio
and the probable occurrence of nosocomial transmission favour a
diagnosis of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagive fever. Further information is
requested. - Mod.CP]
