WHO Concern Over Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Situation
-----------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI: The World Health Organisation (WHO) has expressed concern over
recent [fatalities caused by Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) in
Pakistan, and indicated that if the Pakistani government sought help from
WHO, it could certainly provide a comprehensive plan and strategy to combat
this deadly disease. CCHF is an easily controllable disease at the initial
stage. A regional representative of WHO, Dr. Asad Abro, told newsmen that
according to his findings the first fatal victims of CCHF were 10 persons
from Baluchistan. He was of the opinion that if the government did not
take steps to check the spread of CCHF virus at this preliminary stage, an
uncontrollable epidemic might develop.
CCHF is not an airborne disease. It is contracted through tick-bite and
exposure to an infected animal or patient's blood and fluid secretion.
Therefore, both health professionals and those dealing in the
slaughter and sale of cattle should use gloves as a precautionary measure,
he advised. Dr. Abro observed that the majority of health practitioners
may be unaware of the causes, symptoms and treatment of CCHF.
Additionally, there is no arrangement in place for diagnosis of the disease
through blood tests except at National Institute of Health in Islamabad.
