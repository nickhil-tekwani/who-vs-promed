When the armed forces are mobilized in the response to the horrifying
conditions along the Gulf coast, there will be a very small number of
soldiers who are unaware that they have returned from overseas harboring
malaria. There is also an alarming proximity of dengue (ProMED-mail
20050523.1422) and yellow fever in Central America (ProMED-mail
20050403.0958). With all the standing water left behind by Hurricane
Katrina there will be lots of mosquitoes, and a very small human reservoir
of active hosts is all that is required for a large vector population to
infect a large susceptible population.
Am I being alarmist to draw attention to the need for awareness of malaria
and yellow fever in the response to this disaster? It wasn't so long ago
that these diseases were endemic along the Gulf coast.

Mosquito experience with Hurricane Camile in 1996 (Camille 1969? - Mod.SH)
showed that the hurricanes completely wiped out mosquito populations for at
least a month. One can be sure the same thing is happening along the Gulf
coast.

[Being some 9000 kilometers away and never having experienced the aftermath
of a hurricane, I am rather reticent to pontificate on how such flooding
and storm damage will affect local mosquito populations. But whereas many
may think that with such vast areas of standing water, mosquito populations
will increase explosively, this is not necessarily the case. In many parts
of the world, excessive rainfall or flooding often flushes out larval
habitats and can lead to decreased numbers of adults emerging and biting.
Mosquitoes have a great diversity of breeding places. Some prefer
organically polluted waters (for example contaminated with feces, cadavers,
or rotting vegetation); other species breed in domestic containers, drains,
water-filled tree-holes, in flooded meadows, swamps and marshes; while
still others prefer, or at least tolerate, brackish waters.
Often mosquito breeding increases some time after flooding when the water
recedes, either naturally or through pumping, as this tends to increase the
number of smaller bodies of water, which are often more suitable larval
habitats than larger ones. With different mosquito species colonising such
ecologically different larval sites, it is difficult to predict which -- if
any -- species will proliferate.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention believe that there might be
mosquito problems and that the potential exists for outbreaks of West Nile,
St Louis encephalitis, and dengue. For this to happen, however, there must
be infected hosts in the area, or later entering the area, which in the
case of West Nile includes birds, especially corvids (incidentally,
Louisiana is presently a hot spot for West Nile), while St Louis
encephalitis is also maintained in birds (mainly passeriformes and
columbiformes). But there is little information on the effect hurricane
Katrina has had, and might have, on local bird populations. In the USA and
most of the rest of the world, dengue viruses have no animal reservoir hosts.
I do not think that the hurricane will increase the likelihood of yellow
fever, as this would require infected people to be in the area, and such
people will be viremic only for a very short period -- about 3-4 days. I
might point out that yellow fever is not endemic along the Gulf coast, but
is endemic in many parts of South America. Nor do I believe there is much
chance of malaria transmission from infected troops, because I imagine any
soldier with malarious symptoms (such as high intermittent fever) returning
from overseas would have been treated with antimalarial drugs. Moreover,
infected people would have to be gametocyte carriers. That is because
gametocytes are the forms of the parasite found in humans that have to be
ingested by a female anopheline mosquito for the mosquito to become
infected; then after some 10-14 days, the mosquito becomes infective and
thus able to transmit malaria to humans.
For guidelines, including rationale for recommendations, see the CDC
website <http://www.cdc.gov/travel/other/hurricane/index.htm>.
I understand that past experience has generally shown that there are not
epidemics of mosquitoborne infections after hurricanes. For example, I
believe that there were no major epidemics of vector-borne infections after
the tsunami that hit Asia last year.
The American Mosquito Control Association is well aware of the catastrophic
damage done to parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and the very
severe limitations this has imposed on local authorities who normally
routinely control mosquitoes in populated areas. Whether or not we believe
that vectorborne disease epidemics will appear, I believe control agencies
should be as prepared as possible to deal with any emergencies. - Mod.MS]
