Since April 2008, 613 persons infected with _Salmonella [enterica_
serotype] Saintpaul with the same genetic fingerprint have been
identified in 33 states and the District of Columbia. These were
identified because clinical laboratories in all states send strains
from ill persons to their State public health laboratory for
characterization. The marked increase in reported ill persons since
the last update is not thought to be due to a large number of new
infections. The number of reported ill persons increased mainly
because some states improved surveillance in response to this
outbreak and because laboratory identification of many previously
submitted strains was completed.

In particular, one new state, Massachusetts reported ill persons. The
number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows:
Arkansas (3 persons), Arizona (34), California (8), Colorado (4),
Connecticut (4), Florida (1), Georgia (14), Idaho (3), Illinois (45),
Indiana (9), Kansas (9), Kentucky (1), Maryland (18), Massachusetts
(12), Michigan (4), Missouri (12), New Hampshire (1), New Jersey (1),
New Mexico (79), New York (18), North Carolina (1), Ohio (3),
Oklahoma (17), Oregon (5), Pennsylvania (5), Rhode Island (2),
Tennessee (4), Texas (265), Utah (2), Virginia (21), Vermont (1),
Washington (1), Wisconsin (5), and the District of Columbia (1).
Among the 316 persons with information available, illnesses began
between 10 Apr 2008 and 13 Jun 2008. Patients range in age from less
than 1 to 99 years; 50 percent are female. At least 69 persons were
hospitalized.
