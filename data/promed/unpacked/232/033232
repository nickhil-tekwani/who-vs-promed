Some information: In 2011, we (ABC India) had received funding to conduct a rabies public education program and mass vaccination campaign in Kashmir. The authorities would not allow us to come in and conduct the campaign. (Permission is required as Srinagar is essentially under martial law.)

The numbers of dogs quoted in the *Greater Kashmir* article are grossly overstated. It is a common tactic employed by the local press to stir up anti-dog sentiment. Killing of dogs, though technically illegal in India and denied by Kashmiri authorities, continues there. Humane Society International completed a census of the dog population in Srinagar last year [2012] but has thus far refused to release the results.

[Below are extracts from an article written by Lisa Warden, a former director of ABC India, for the Indian news magazine "Tehelka," which provides some relevant background (http://tehelka.com/doggyleaks-the-truth-about-kashmirs-canines-and-the-cost-of-negligence/.

"First, dogs will never outnumber humans in Srinagar. Their population is relative to and dependent upon the human population, and will always be in keeping with the dog-to-human ratio found in the rest of India -- between one and 5 dogs to every 100 people. Secondly, Indian dogs only produce one litter per year, not 2. Third, the average life expectancy of street dogs in urban India, of dogs who survive to the age of one year, is 3.4 years (not 14-16 years as cited in the preceding article). Only one or 2 puppies per litter actually survive in places where the habitat is at full carrying capacity. Each habitat has a maximum number of dogs it can support -- which brings us to the question: why are there so many dogs in Srinagar? The answer is edible waste, and failure to implement WHO/AWBI-sanctioned methods for dog population and rabies control.

Last time I checked, public sanitation/waste disposal and public health were the responsibility of the government. The call for resumption of mass-killing of dogs in Srinagar is a knee-jerk reaction in response to nothing other than negligent governance.

Killing dogs, or their incarceration in pounds, simply does not work as a population-control policy. It has never worked anywhere it has been undertaken, even when the numbers of dogs killed or removed are in the tens of thousands, because dogs are so fertile that they simply repopulate the existing habitat in the subsequent breeding season. As long as there is a habitat, there will be dogs. And as long as that habitat is meat offal, dogs will be more aggressive in protecting their food source than if it were, say, dal and chapatis.

There is a solution to Kashmir's canine woes, and it is as follows: sterilisation of over 70 percent of free-roaming dogs (and not just a small pilot project), and waste disposal reform. This is the only scientifically proven approach to resolving the matter, and the only legal one.

Are sterilised dogs ever a menace? On occasion, and those that engage in unprovoked attacks on humans need to be removed from the population by people qualified to know the difference. However, the 2 most significant factors that result in dog bites -- migration and mating -- are actually exacerbated by killing and/or impounding of dogs, and/or failing at the sterilisation project.

Sterilisation drastically reduces incidences of dog bites by eliminating maternal aggression and fights during mating. It also reduces the number of dogs. Are Kashmir's various municipal authorities going to get on with addressing the problem by cleaning up the ubiquitous slaughter waste and sterilising over 70 percent of the dogs -- a task for which various groups and agencies have bent over backwards to offer assistance, by the way -- or will they continue scapegoating dogs and animal activists in a disingenuous attempt to cover up their own shambolic governance."
