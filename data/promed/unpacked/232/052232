The emergency department of Tlemcen University Hospital today [28 Aug 2015] admitted a man aged about 50 years in critical condition due to exposure to the bite of a wolf as he was undertaking a tour in Tlemcen forest. The man was abruptly attacked by the wolf and this caused him facial wounds, which required taking him to hospital for treatment.

An investigation was opened to determine whether the wolf was rabid and take the necessary actions to protect the victim as much as possible from the risk of death from rabies.

[Up until 2008, it was thought that wolves did not exist in Africa. However, based on the behavior of what were believed to be large golden jackals (_Canis lupus lupaster_) and the analysis of their DNA, it was determined that they definitely were grey wolves (_Lupus_).

These solitary animals generally live on the outskirts of small packs of jackals. In northern Africa, it is not uncommon to spot them near homes eating livestock carcasses or at the roadside, coming from forests surrounding cities and villages, where they settle. (summarized from source: http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/air-du-temps/il-y-a-bien-des-loups-en-afrique-14-10-2012-2230815.php#xtref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)

Canine rabies is endemic in Algeria, and the suspected wolf, if confirmed to be rabid, could well have been contaminated by a rabid dog encountered in the suburbs of Tlemcen during a fight between the domestic and the wild _Canidae_.

Information on the results of the laboratory analysis performed to diagnose rabies would be appreciated. - Mod.AB

The scientific publication on the genetics of the large golden jackals and wolves in N. Africa, referred to by Mod.AB above, is included in Ref 1, the abstract of which follows:

"Abstract
The recent discovery of a lineage of gray wolf in North-East Africa suggests the presence of a cryptic canid on the continent, the African wolf _Canis lupus lupaster_. We analyzed the mtDNA diversity (cytochrome b and control region) of a series of African Canis including wolf-like animals from North and West Africa. Our objectives were to assess the actual range of _C. l. lupaster_, to further estimate the genetic characteristics and demographic history of its lineage, and to question its taxonomic delineation from the golden jackal _C. aureus_, with which it has been considered synonymous. We confirmed the existence of 4 distinct lineages within the gray wolf, including _C. lupus/familiaris_ (Holarctic wolves and dogs), _C. l. pallipes_, _C. l. chanco_ and _C. l. lupaster_. Taxonomic assignment procedures identified wolf-like individuals from Algeria, Mali and Senegal, as belonging to _C. l. lupaster_, expanding its known distribution c. 6000 km to the west. We estimated that the African wolf lineage (i) had the highest level of genetic diversity within _C. lupus_, (ii) coalesced during the Late Pleistocene, contemporaneously with Holarctic wolves and dogs, and (iii) had an effective population size of c. 80 000 females. Our results suggest that the African wolf is a relatively ancient gray wolf lineage with a fairly large, past effective population size, as also suggested by the Pleistocene fossil record. Unique field observations in Senegal allowed us to provide a morphological and behavioral diagnosis of the African wolf that clearly distinguished it from the sympatric golden jackal. However, the detection of _C. l. lupaster_ mtDNA haplotypes in _C. aureus_ from Senegal brings the delineation between the African wolf and the golden jackal into question. In terms of conservation, it appears urgent to further characterize the status of the African wolf with regard to the African golden jackal."

The paper, available on-line at http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0042740#abstract0, includes a table, graphs and pictures.

The number of rabies cases in humans, as reported by Algeria to the OIE since 2010, is as follows:
2014 - 7
2013 - presently no quantitative data
2012 - 23
2011 - 17
2010 - 9
