The Kailahun District Health Management Team has reported suspected imported cases of measles from Guinea to the Kissi Kama Chiefdom in the Kailahun district [Sierra Leone]. The Surveillance Report states that 2 samples were collected from 2 children from Kunduma, Kama Chiefdom and who were seen and treated at the Dia Community Health Centre. 1 child [SK] exhibited the typical prodromal stage with coryza and weakness. According to the surveillance report 10 children are suspected to have measles.

Meanwhile, the Kailahun District Health Management Team on Saturday 4 Jul 2015 mounted community sensitization campaign in all 8 villages in the chiefdom with the Ring Vaccination of the leftover buffer stock from the past measles campaign.

Earlier on 10 Jul 2015 it was reported that: Suspected Measles Cases had been reported in Kailahun District (http://www.premiermedia.sl/content/suspected-measles-cases-reported-kailahun-district}. "The Kailahun District Health Management Team had reported suspected imported cases of Measles from Guinea to the Kissi Kama Chiefdom in the Kailahun District Community Health Centre.

The Ministry of Health and Sanitation in collaboration with UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centre for Disease Control early in June conducted a six-day nationwide measles and polio vaccination campaign.

Children 9-59 months of age were targeted, while for the polio immunization children 0-59 months were also targeted.

Dr Marke said 1st-time pregnant women will also receive a referral slip to collect Long Lasting Insecticide Nets (LLIN). He called on parents to take their children for vaccination during the campaign. "This vaccination has nothing to do with Ebola," he said. "All children under 5 years should be vaccinated against polio regardless of the number of previous polio vaccinia," he said.

The measles campaign intended achieving 95 percent coverage during the vaccination campaign. He said plans are afoot to reach hard-to-reach communities, including riverine communities. The measles campaign came following report of 5 confirmed measles cases in Kono District out of 31 suspected cases.

According to a recent study, 864 children in Sierra Leone have been suspected of being affected with measles. The largest number of suspected measles cases during the assessment period was identified in the Western Area Urban with 297 cases, followed by Koinadugu with 159 cases, and Bo with 124 cases. 92 percent of suspected measles cases identified during the assessment were children under 5. Infants accounted for 29 percent of cases and children 1-4 years accounted for another 63 percent.

[II] WHO urges vaccinations in Ebola-hit countries where health care disrupted
http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/3/20/who-warns-of-measles-in-ebola-countries.html
The World Health Organization (WHO) warned on Friday of an outbreak risk for measles, whooping cough and other diseases in West African countries hit by Ebola, and urged for a rapid increase of immunizations.
The Ebola epidemic has killed more than 10,200 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and has reduced general vaccination coverage as health clinics and health care workers focus on fighting the unprecedented outbreak.
In recent months, Ebola has started to wane with the number of cases falling significantly, though a spike in Guinea this week highlighted the risk of complacency. The epidemic has disrupted delivery of routine childhood vaccines against measles, polio and tuberculosis, and of a combined shot against meningitis, pneumonia, whooping cough, tetanus, hepatitis B and diphtheria.

Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele, WHO's vaccines director, told a briefing in Geneva that the health agency wanted an intensification of immunization services and mass measles vaccination campaigns in all areas where feasible. "Campaigns will only be conducted in areas that are free of Ebola virus transmission," he said, stressing that clinics and health workers administering vaccines would be required to adhere to very strict infection control measures.

WHO sent a warning note to affected countries this week saying: "Any disruption of immunization services, even for short periods ... will increase the likelihood of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks."

A study published last week by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore warned that measles cases could almost double in countries hit hardest by Ebola. The researchers calculated that for every extra month that health care systems were disrupted, up to 20 000 children aged between 9 months and 5 years were put at risk.

Measles is a viral disease that killed around 146 000 people globally in 2013, mostly children under 5, according to latest data. That equated to almost 17 deaths every hour. Among the most transmissible diseases, measles outbreaks often follow humanitarian crises as vaccination campaigns falter and populations are displaced and impoverished.

Edward Kelley, WHO's director of service delivery and safety, said the focus on boosting vaccination coverage rates was "part of the early recovery work [as the Ebola outbreak wanes] and among the very pressing recovery pieces that needs to get done." - Mod.CP]

The Health Ministry today confirmed a 9th case of measles in the country. This [case] is a woman of 27 years who lives in the metropolitan area, which is linked to the 3rd person infected. The Health Ministry said that, like all confirmed cases that are directly related to the 3rd case, the woman was under surveillance and blocking [isolation?] measures were taken early. In addition, the Health Ministry reiterated that travelers who visit countries [where there ongoing measles cases?] have the recommended measles vaccination, especially:

- People born between 1971 and 1981, who have no history of the disease or have completed 2 doses of the vaccine after 12 months.
- Infants 6-11 months of age traveling to countries with cases.
- Children between 1-6 years have an administered dose, traveling to countries with cases.

To be vaccinated free of charge at public or private facilities requires a doctor's order or passage from his next trip, said the Ministry.

Measles was a huge public health issue for the Philippines in 2014, when the country reported more than 58 000 cases and 110 deaths. In addition, travelers from the Philippines were linked to measles outbreaks in a number of other countries, including the United States and Canada. During the 1st 5 months of 2014, the archipelago saw 36 493 cases and 77 deaths. Turn the clock forward 1 year. During the 1st 5 months of 2015, the UN health agency has reported 1902 cases and just 2 fatalities. What a difference a year makes. In September 2014, the Philippines Department of Health kicked off a large measles vaccination campaign (ligtas tigdas) and reported some promising numbers that may have carried over to 2015.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that mainly affects children. It is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms usually appear 10-12 days after infection, and include high fever, runny nose, bloodshot eyes, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards.

Measles can be prevented by immunization. There is no specific treatment, and most people recover within 2-3 weeks. However, measles can cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infections and pneumonia, particularly in malnourished children and people with reduced immunity.

The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed 2 imported measles infections in travelers to China, prompting a warning to the public. Health officials say 2 women, ages 35 and 29, were confirmed for measles infection and are currently hospitalized.

According to the epidemiological investigation, the 2 cases have visited Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Shanghai, China together 18-29 Jun 2015. This suggests that they might have acquired the infection while in China. Health authorities have implemented a number of prevention measures and identified 174 contacts, including their family members, passengers sitting near the cases on the same flight, colleagues, healthcare personnel and patients that he came into contact with when they sought medical attention, to monitor and follow up until 28 Jul 2015. Currently, none of them has developed suspected symptoms.

The public is urged to put on a mask and seek prompt medical attention when suspected symptoms such as fever and rash develop and inform the physician of relevant exposure history. So far in 2015, a total of 22 indigenous measles cases (19 were clustered cases who work at the same place) and 5 imported measles cases from China have been confirmed in Taiwan. This compares to the same period in 2014 when 17 measles cases were confirmed, including 3 indigenous cases and 14 imported cases (5 imported from the Philippines, 5 imported from China, and 1 each from Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Vietnam.)

[The Regional Committee of the Western Pacific resolved to eliminate measles in 2003, established the 2012 target year in 2005, and reaffirmed the goal in 2010. Measles elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles transmission in a defined geographical area (such as country or region) for at least 12 months in the presence of a well-performing surveillance system.

Measles virus importations and limited transmission will likely occur following elimination of endemic transmission until measles is eliminated in other parts of the world.

Strategies for measles elimination include:

- achieving and maintaining 95 percent population immunity against measles virus in each birth cohort through routine and/or supplementary immunization activities (SIAs);
- sensitive and timely case-based surveillance for measles;
- access to an accredited laboratory to confirm suspected cases and
identify virus. (http://www.wpro.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs_20120224/en/)

With data through September 2014, there were 45 234 confirmed cases in China and the detected genotypes were B3, D8, D9, G3, and H1. (http://www.wpro.who.int/immunization/documents/measles_country_profile_mar2015_chn.pdf) The epidemiological link with cases in the 3 main cities in China could be further ascertained through detailed investigation. - Mod.ST

Belarus has 1 imported case of measles. The Ministry of Health of Belarus does not rule out the possibility of other imported cases of measles. This is especially true during the summer holidays and vacations.

According to the deputy chief doctor of the "National Center for Hygiene, Epidemiology and Public Health," Lyudmila Naroychik, other European countries often record measles. In 2014 Belarus recorded 5 imported cases of measles. So far in 2015, Belorus has already record 1 imported case. The infections have been from Russia, Israel, Spain, Turkey, according to BelTA [unclear whether this refers just to 2014, or other years as well].

Measles is included in the national immunization schedule, and if vaccination is carried out, even in adulthood the person retains immunity. In this regard, it is important to get vaccinated before traveling abroad.
