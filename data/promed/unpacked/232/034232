The Aomori Prefectural Government on Thursday afternoon [15 Dec 2022] started to cull all of some 1.37 million chickens raised at a poultry farm in the city of Misawa, where an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed.

The number of chickens to be culled due to an avian flu outbreak is the largest ever for a single farm in Japan, according to the agriculture ministry. It is expected to take about a month to cull all of the egg-laying hens at the Misawa farm.

The latest case is the 2nd bird flu outbreak at a farm in the prefecture this season and the 35th across the country.

At the request of Aomori Gov. Shingo Mimura, who is now on a business trip to Taiwan, 60 Ground Self-Defense Force troops were dispatched to join the work to cull the chickens.

In response to the outbreak, the prefectural government held a crisis management meeting at its head office in the city of Aomori. "Chicken farming is an important industry that underpins the local economy, so we must prevent infection from spreading to other farms by all means," Mimura, who took part in the meeting online, said, instructing prefectural officials to thoroughly take necessary measures.

The operator of the Misawa farm reported to the prefecture Wednesday [14 Dec 2022] that the number of birds that died in one of its chicken coops had increased to 180, according to the local government.

Simple tests were conducted on 13 of the dead chickens, and 11 of them showed positive results. Genetic testing confirmed the outbreak Thursday [15 Dec 2022].

At a news conference in Tokyo on Thursday [15 Dec 2022], Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, the top spokesman of the national government, said, "We are ready to provide necessary support (to cope with the outbreak) while working closely with the Aomori Prefectural Government".

[The estimated start of the 2022/2023 HPAI season in Japan goes back to 24 Sep 2022, when a dead Peregrine falcon (_Falco peregrinus_) was found in Kanagawa prefecture and found as infected by HPAI H5N1 (20221003.8705932). This was followed by the recording of the 1st outbreak on a poultry farm, similarly in Kagawa, on 28 Oct 2022. It was the 1st time a bird flu outbreak occurred at any farm in the country before November.

Since then, the H5N1 virus has spread further, currently known to circulate throughout the country. Japan's most recent follow-up report (FUR) No 6, was submitted on 7 Dec 2022. As of that date, 22 outbreaks on poultry farms were reported, scattered throughout Japan from north to south, as presented in a WOAH map. The map accompanies the FUR 6 report, which is available at https://wahis.woah.org/#/in-review/4689?fromPage=event-dashboard-url.

On top of the HPAI H5N1 outbreaks on poultry farms, Japan has reported additional cases in wild birds. - Mod.AS
