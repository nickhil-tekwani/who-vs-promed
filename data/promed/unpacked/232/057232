Avian influenza situation in Indonesia -- WHO update
----------------------------------------------------
As of 12 Mar 2012, the Ministry of Health of Indonesia has notified WHO of a new case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus.

The case is a 24-year-old female from Bengkulu Province. She developed fever on 23 Feb 2012 and was hospitalized on the following day. She had breathing difficulty; her condition deteriorated, and she died on 1 Mar 2012.

Epidemiological investigation conducted by a team of public health and animal health authorities indicated an exposure to a potentially contaminated environment where sudden deaths of poultry had occurred recently.

The case was confirmed by the National Institute of Health Research and Development, Ministry of Health. To date, of the 187 cases reported in Indonesia since 2005, 155 have been fatal.

[This represents the WHO confirmation of the previously suspected human case of avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection reported in the ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza, human (29): Indonesia (WJ) susp 20120305.1061611".

Curiously the residence of the deceased patient is now stated to be Bengkulu (also known as Southwest Sumatra) province of Indonesia, and not West Java as stated previously. Bengkulu is located on the southwest coast of the island of Sumatra, and borders the provinces of West Sumatra, Jambi, South Sumatra and Lampung. Bengkulu can be located in the HealthMap interactive map at: http://healthmap.org/r/1ZW9. - Mod.CP]
