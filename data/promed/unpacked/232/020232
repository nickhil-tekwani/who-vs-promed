Animal Health Status Report
----------------------------
1. No. 1
2. Report date: 5 Nov 2001
3. Country: New Zealand
4. Name of sender: Derek Belton
5. Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry
MAF Biosecurity Authority
PO Box 2526
Wellington
6. Position: Director of Animal Biosecurity
7. Phone: +64 4 474 4100

9. E-mail: <beltond@maf.govt.nz>
10. Suspected _Mycoplasma mycoides_ subspecies _mycoides_ (large colony) in
goats and cattle
11. B154 (_Mycoplasma mycoides_ subspecies _mycoides_ (LC) is considered to
be one of the causes of contagious agalactia. _Mycoplasma agalactiae_ has
not been recorded in New Zealand.)
12. Diagnosis by laboratory identification of the agent.
13. Date of initial detection: Clinical cases in kids were first noticed by
the farmer on 25 Jul 2001. MAF was notified on 9 Aug. _Mycoplasma_ was
isolated from kid synovial fluid samples collected on 13 Aug. Clinical
cases in calves (separate property, epidemiologically linked through the
feeding of unpasteurized goats' milk to calves) began on 9 Aug 2001, with
MAF notified on 31 Aug. _Mycoplasma_ was isolated from calf synovial fluid
collected on 4 Sep. Isolates from kids and calves were typed as _Mycoplasma
mycoides_ subspecies _mycoides_ (LC) on 30 Oct 2001.
14. Estimated date of first infection: Presently unknown.
15. Geographical location: Waikato.
16. Species code: CAP, BOV
Total number of animals in outbreaks: Populations of kids and calves on the
dairy goat and dairy cattle properties have not been stable during the
investigation as a result of seasonal kidding and calving, and movement of
calves between properties with joint management relationships.
Cases: 34 kids, 39 calves.
Deaths: 3 kids, 10 calves.
Destroyed: 5 kids, 2 calves.
17. Description of newly affected population
Kids on a dairy goat property, and calves on a dairy cattle property that
were fed unpasteurized milk from the dairy goat property.
18. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: _Mycoplasma_ isolated at the
National Centre for Disease Investigation (NCDI), Wallaceville, New
Zealand. Typing work performed at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory,
Geelong, Australia, and the Veterinary Laboratory Agency, Weybridge, United
Kingdom. Final typing by VLA, UK.
19. Diagnostic test used: Culture and typing by PCR and growth inhibition
test with hyperimmune rabbit antiserum.
Serological testing (complement fixation test) undertaken at NCDI of kids,
does (sampled 13 August) and calves (sampled 6 September and 8 October) was
negative for _Mycoplasma mycoides_, _capricolum_ and _agalactiae_.
Sequencing of the organism's genome is to occur to verify the subspecies
and strain.
20. Causal agent: Suspected to be _Mycoplasma mycoides_ subspecies
_mycoides_ (large colony).
21. Source of agent/Origin of infection: Not known.
22. Mode of spread:
Spread from the dairy goat property to the dairy cattle property is
believed to have occurred as a result of the cattle property purchasing
unpasteurized milk from a dairy factory for feeding to calves. The milk was
purchased on 25 Jul and included milk collected from the affected goat
property. The milk was fed to the calves between 26 Jul and 9 Aug. Milk
samples from 25 Jul that were retained by the dairy factory have been
tested and _Mycoplasma_ isolated. The potential for spread to other
properties to have occurred as a result of livestock movements is presently
being investigated.
23. Other epidemiological details:
Affected kids are initially septicemic, then develop polyarthritis obvious
in the carpus and hock. There are no clinical signs of pneumonia or
conjunctivitis in kids. On postmortem examination of chronically affected
kids there were minimal pulmonary lesions. Synovial fluid produced a
moderate growth of a mycoplasma, whereas bronchi, nares, trachea,
pericardial fluid, thoracic fluid, bladder, lung, and spleen were negative.
Affected calves have polyarthritis and occasionally mild conjunctivitis.
Calves do not appear septicemic, they retain their appetite, and there is
no clinical evidence of pneumonia. In animals submitted to postmortem
examination there was fibrinosuppurative polyarthritis and focal pneumonia,
with focal areas of consolidation in the cranioventral lobes of the lungs.
Pure growths of mycoplasma were cultured from the joints. _Mycoplasma_ was
also recovered from the trachea.
The index dairy goat property and the holdings where calves that were fed
infected milk are presently held are under movement restrictions. Calves
have remained isolated from adult cattle since exposure to infected milk.
Movements of calves has resulted in a total of 5 cattle properties being
under movement restrictions. Tracing has established all movements of goats
to and from the goat property since 1997. 2 further goat properties that
have received high risk livestock movements have also been placed under
movement restrictions. The eight properties under movement restrictions are
in Waikato (3 goat properties, 4 cattle properties) and South Canterbury
(one cattle property). Tracing and surveillance will continue this week.
Sera from goats and calves that tested negative at NCDI were sent on 31 Oct
to VLA, Weybridge, for testing. The failure of serology to detect animals
confirmed infected by isolation of the causative agent is presently
unexplained.
To MAF's knowledge, this would be the first confirmed report of _Mycoplasma
mycoides_ subspecies _mycoides_ (LC) in cattle.
MAF, industry and veterinary experts are meeting on 9 Nov to further
consider response options.
