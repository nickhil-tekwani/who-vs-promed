DISEASE EARLY WARNING, CLIMATE AND GIS-BASED

The below information for your consideration for posting describes
practical applications of monitoring individual animals using space-based
technologies. It was prepared by my Earthspan colleague, Dr William S
Seegar. Dr Seegar has been a key player in the development and application
of satellite monitoring of individual animals for over 2 decades. Global
disease surveillance is being enhanced using this technology.

In your 13 Mar 2004 posting "Disease Early Warning System, Climate and
GIS-Based" ProMED-mail invited additional information on practical
application of space-based technologies.
"Tagging" individual animals with miniature microprocessor-controlled
platform transmitter terminals (PTT) that are received by satellite is an
invaluable tool in identifying the geographic locations and local
conditions where threats exist for migratory birds and, in some cases,
other animals and humans. The most publicized practical application of this
technology is its use in solving the mystery of the crash of North American
Swainson's hawk (_Buteo swainsoni_) populations in the 1990s. Woodbridge
and colleagues in 1995 radio-tracked a bird from central California to
Argentina and found evidence of high mortality there. The question became:
to what extent was the entire Swainson's hawk population exposed to the
threat? We collaborated with many other biologists to radio-mark 50
Swainson's hawks with PTTs, for a representative sample from their nesting
range. All of these hawks were tracked to central Argentina. In 1996,
Goldstein and colleagues visited areas indicated by the satellite-derived
location data and counted over 4000 dead Swainson's hawks killed as a side
effect of pesticide (Monocrotophos) applications to croplands. They
estimated that total mortality exceeded 20 000 birds.
The entire Canadian Swainson's hawk population is estimated at 20-40 000
pairs. This loss represented a catastrophic threat to the species. Through
the use of satellite-based telemetry, the area used by the hawks was
delineated and, within 18 months, the problem was remedied through
collaborative government and private sector management and education.
In an ongoing study, common loons (_Gavia immer_) migrating through western
Nevada have been found to be burdened with high levels of methyl-mercury.
With satellite biotelemetry we are identifying migration routes, breeding,
and wintering areas to find the source(s) of contamination and assess the
threat to overall populations. Similarly, white-faced ibis (_Plegadis
chihi_) are being tracked from nesting grounds in the Great Basin of
Nevada. About half the population of ibis has DDT/DDE contamination. We
know these ibis are NOT being contaminated in Nevada. Tracking several
contaminated white-faced ibis, we are identifying sites used by those
individuals outside their breeding area, and sampling these sites for DDT/DDE.
The development of models to forecast the dynamics of various infectious
diseases can also be enhanced by the tracking and monitoring of miniature
microprocessor-controlled PTTs with sensor arrays. These can provide
valuable information on the movements through time and space of sentinel
animals and the environmental variables that affect their movement.
Embedded terminals can detect local, regional, and transcontinental
movements of target animal populations, while collecting data on the
microclimate surrounding the organisms. These data are essential in the
initiation and enhanced predictability of models forecasting disease
dynamics. These rapidly evolving global tracking and monitoring
capabilities, when fully integrated with space-based remote sensing
information, will dramatically enhance the functionality of predictive
models and knowledge of the geographic movement and dynamics of host
populations and disease vectors. Immediate application of these evolving
capabilities could be helpful in addressing the pandemic threat of avian
influenza viruses and the arboviruses. The use of embedded micro-sensors on
sentinel animals in geographic regions where data for model initiation are
scarce or nonexistent (that is, meteorological data) will improve early
warning and forecast functions.
The technology is evolving rapidly on a global scale with the fielding of
commercial asset tracking systems, and is available for use now on a vast
array of environmental and public health issues that pose significant
threats to biodiversity and human health worldwide.

[In our earlier posting on the use of satellite technology, this moderator
commented "we look forward to hearing information from the practical
application of this technology". The above description of satellite
monitoring of tagged avian populations to identify the etiology of an
unexplained reduction in Swanson's hawk population is impressive, as is the
current use to identify source of DDT/pesticide exposure of the white-faced
ibis. ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Bob Whitney and Dr William Seegar
for sharing this information with ProMED-mail readers. - Mod.MPP]
