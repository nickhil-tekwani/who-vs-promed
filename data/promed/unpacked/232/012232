Occupationally acquired _Salmonella_ I 4,12:i:1,2 infection in a phlebotomist -- Minnesota, January 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 25 Jan 2013, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) was notified of 2 clinical cases of _Salmonella_ I 4,12:i:1,2 infection with isolates that had indistinguishable pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns. Illness onset dates were 3 Jan 2013 and 9 Jan 2013. Patients A and B were hospitalized at the same hospital during 12-15 Jan 2013 for dehydration. Investigations indicated that these cases were part of a multistate outbreak associated with frozen mice purchased to feed snakes.

On 25 Jan 2013, the MDH Public Health Laboratory isolated _Salmonella_ I 4,12:i:1,2 with an indistinguishable PFGE pattern from a 3rd Minnesota resident, patient C. Patient C denied contact with frozen feeder mice or snakes, but was employed as a phlebotomist at the hospital where the 2 infected patients were hospitalized. Protocol at the hospital requires that each phlebotomist use a hand-held sample tracking device to scan the identification band of each patient from whom blood is drawn. Accessing these records, the infection prevention specialist at the hospital found that patient C drew blood from patient A on 13 Jan 2013 and from patients A and B on 14 Jan 2013, which was 3 days before onset of patient C's symptoms on 17 Jan 2013. Patient C reported use of gloves while drawing blood.

In the absence of specific evidence for any other risk factor for _Salmonella_ I 4,12:i:1,2 infection and considering the temporal relationship between exposure and symptom onset, occupational person-to-person contact with patients A or B likely was the source of patient C's infection. _Salmonella_ transmission from infected patients to health-care workers, although rare, has been reported (1). This investigation documents the 1st reported case of occupationally acquired salmonellosis in a phlebotomist and underscores the personal risk that health-care workers face when caring for patients. Health-care workers from all disciplines must remain vigilant in protecting themselves from occupationally acquired infections through the use of proven strategies (such as regular disinfection of patient-care equipment, hand hygiene, and correct use of personal protective equipment) (2).

[The circumstances of occupational transmission of the organism to the phlebotomist remain unclear. Previously, human infections associated with feeder rodents have been caused by a similar organism, serotype I 4,5,12,i-.

Regarding the organism's designation, as discussed by Ana Paccagnella (supervisor of the Enteric Bacteriology Section at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control), http://www.bcfpa.net/Attachments/Presentations/Conference2005/Naming%20Salmonella%20(A%20Paccagnella)%2008%20Nov%2005.pdf, _Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. It should be noted that serotype Typhimurium carries somatic antigens 4, 5 and 12 (the Group B antigens). Paccagnella pointed out to me in an email that an O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not.
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i: 1,2, reflects the flagellar or H antigens. It is these H antigens that define the serotype identity within an individual group of salmonellae.

Almost all of these organisms are biphasic in regard to the H antigens, that is, they can switch from one flagellar antigen to another; as an example, _S._ Typhimurium is I 4, 5, 12:i:1,2. - Mod.LL
