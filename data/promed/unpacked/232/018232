[1] Cholera - USA (Puerto Rico) ex Dominican Republic

http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/puerto-rico-1st-cholera-case-confirmed-in-us-island-in-traveler-from-dominican-republic/2011/07/04/gHQAbmT6xH_story.html


Puerto Rico is reporting the American island's 1st case of cholera
linked to the current outbreak in neighboring Hispaniola.

Health secretary Lorenzo Gonzalez Feliciano said Mon 4 Jul 2011 that
the case involved a 70 year old man who had visited the Dominican
Republic for a week. Gonzalez said the man is hospitalized in San
Juan. Privacy laws prohibited them from releasing more information
about the case.

Health officials believe the disease is unlikely to spread because of
better sanitation on Puerto Rico.

[2] Cholera - China (Hong Kong SAR), locally acquired
Date: Wed 6 Jul 2011

http://7thspace.com/headlines/388456/confirmed_cholera_case_under_investigation.html


The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health
today (6 Jul 2011) is investigating a confirmed case of cholera and
reminds people to observe good personal, food and environmental
hygiene, whether in Hong Kong or traveling abroad.

The case involves a 25 year old man who developed diarrhea on 27 Jun
2011. He attended Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital for medical
consultation but did not require hospitalization. Laboratory tests
later showed that culture of his stool specimen yielded _Vibrio
cholerae_ [serotype] O1 [biotype] Ogawa.

The patient has been admitted to the isolation ward of Princess
Margaret Hospital and is in stable condition. He did not have history
of recent travel. His home contacts have no symptoms of cholera.

This is the 1st case of cholera reported this year [2011]. There were
9 cholera cases in 2010, none in 2009, and 7 in 2008.

[As a short review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _V. cholerae_ are
shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in
distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic)
antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into more
than 200 known serotypes. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_
are nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain
(which is "non-O1"), a single serotype, designated O1, has been
responsible for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 biotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima,
each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype. The
biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A,
B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C; and
Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare.

Sindh chief minister Syed Qaim Ali Shah has taken notice of a news
item, which appeared in a section of the Press regarding reported
non-awareness of Sindh government about 4 cholera cases. An official
statement issued here on Monday [4 Jul 2011] said that the paper
alleges that cholera, a waterborne disease, has been reported in
Karachi, but there was no heed to the health threat that may become an
epidemic within a short span of time. The chief minister has directed
Sindh Secretary Health to take preventive, precautionary and
pro-active action and also called for a report of such cases.

At least a dozen patients admitted in different hospitals of the
capital have tested positive for cholera. Since all the patients are
residents of Kathmandu, the doctors say the disease might have already
spread, making drinking water in several parts of the capital unsafe.

The Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Control Hospital, Teku
has detected 11 cases of cholera in the past 2 weeks. According to the
hospital's research unit, cholera was confirmed in patients admitted
in the hospital for the treatment of diarrhea. The patients are from
Kritipur, Sitapaila, Kalanki, Kalopul and other locations of the
capital.

Dr Rajesh Shah, a member of the research unit said the "[serotype] 01
[biotype] Ogawa" strain of cholera was detected in all the patients.
Shah warned of more cases in the coming days, as, everyday, more than
15 new patients afflicted with diarrhea come to the hospital for
treatment.

Similarly, a cholera case has been identified at Kanti Children's
Hospital. "Cholera has been detected in a child admitted in the
hospital," Dr Tirtha Raj Burlakoti, director of the hospital, said. He
added that 77 patients with diarrheal disease have been treated in the
hospital within 2 weeks.

Likewise, Patan Hospital also said that cholera has been detected in
some of the diarrheal patients.

Nine people died recently, while 194 were hospitalized following a
fresh outbreak of cholera in Chiredzi, a senior provincial health
official confirmed on Thu 7 Jul 2011.

Masvingo provincial medical director Robert Mudyiradima told NewsDay
that the most affected areas include Lapache, Umbono and Nyahombe in
Lowveld district. He said the latest outbreak, believed to have
started in neighboring Chisumbanje Tea Estates in Manicaland, had left
194 people hospitalized.

"As you are aware, Chiredzi borders Manicaland, where the disease was
1st detected. We believe farm workers moving in search of jobs brought
the disease to Chiredzi. That is why Chiredzi has been a problem
area."
