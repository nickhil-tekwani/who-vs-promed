As of Tue 9 Jan 2018, there have been a total of:
1764 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
713 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.4 per cent],
1031 recoveries, and
20 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections as they are reported. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. Another complication is delayed reporting of cases which occurred during this period. On 3 Jan 2018, there was no official report available on the English language page. As there were reports available on the Arabic language page, this information was translated for inclusion in this report. - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update, through 1 Jan 2018, there have been a total of:
8 newly confirmed cases,
3 newly reported fatalities, and
0 newly reported recoveries.

[It's been a very active start to the new year with 8 newly confirmed cases reported from Saudi Arabia in the 1st 9 days of 2018. Five of the 8 newly confirmed cases were from Riyadh with one of these cases being in a healthcare worker (see newly confirmed case no. 2 above). The other 3 cases were reported from Buraidah (Al Qaṣīm region), Najran (Najran region) and Mulayjah (Ash Sharquiyah - Eastern region). Seven of the 8 newly confirmed cases were classified as primary cases with 4 of these cases reporting a history of direct contact with camels, and the remaining 3 were still under investigation for high risk exposure history. One of the 8 newly confirmed cases was a healthcare worker reported to have been nosocomially acquired.

The coming days will be important to watch to see whether this is a single case that is nosocomially acquired or whether there is the 1st indicator of a nosocomial outbreak in Riyadh (perhaps explaining some of the other 3 cases reported from Riyadh who were still under investigation for high risk exposures.

Maps showing the locations of the newly confirmed cases can be found at the source URLs.
