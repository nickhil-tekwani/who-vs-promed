[1] ECDC update

Update since 11 Jul 2011
------------------------
As of today 11 Jul 2011, using the new case definition, the
cumulative number of non-HUS [hemolytic uremic syndrome] STEC [Shiga
toxin producing _Escherichia coli_] cases in the EU is 3041, including
16 deaths, and 757 HUS STEC cases, including 28 deaths.

In Germany, since 8 Jul 2011, 5 HUS STEC cases and 13 non-HUS STEC
cases have been newly reported. 4 HUS STEC cases and 12 non-HUS STEC
cases fell ill within the last 10 days (29 Jun-8 Jul 2011). The last
known date of illness onset in a patient with confirmed STEC O104 was
27 Jun 2011. The last reported date of illness onset among all cases
was 4 Jul 2011.

The United Kingdom reports an additional confirmed non-HUS STEC case,
in a visiting German national coming from Hamburg.

With regards to the outbreak in Bordeaux, France, since the last
update on 30 Jun 2011, 2 HUS STEC cases and 3 non-HUS STEC cases have
been newly confirmed. 3 of these cases had eaten sprouted seeds at an
event in Begles, and the other 2 (one HUS STEC, one non-HUS STEC) have
been attributed to person-to-person transmission.

Suspected cases (Germany: 156 HUS (7 deaths), France: 5 non-HUS STEC)
are not included.

their total as well as deaths reported, the daily trends of the
numbers can be seen:

Fri 8 Jul: 1 / 9 / 10 / 44
Mon 11 Jul: 7 / 17 /24 / 44 (3 day gap)

Total cases: 3798 with 44 deaths -- 1.16 per cent case fatality rate.
The new case definition resulted in lower total cases and deaths but
did not affect case fatality rate.

The cases do not necessarily reflect date of onset of disease but
rather when the diagnosis was made and reported. The number of newly
reported cases per day clearly decreased from the corresponding day in
the previous week.

Cases continue to be recognized more than 2 months after the initial
cases occurred.

No data are yet available regarding the use of certain antimicrobials
such as imipenem as an adjuvant treatment or whether the
anti-complement monoclonal antibody eculizumab has had a reproducible
clinical effect. - Mod.LL]

[2] France: Bordeaux cluster update
Date: Fri 8 Jul 2011

http://www.invs.sante.fr/Dossiers-thematiques/Maladies-infectieuses/Risques-infectieux-d-origine-alimentaire/Syndrome-hemolytique-et-uremique/Actualites/Cas-groupes-d-infections-a-Escherichia-coli-entero-hemorragique-EHEC-en-Gironde-Point-au-8-juillet-2011


On 22 Jun 2011, 2 hospitals in Bordeaux reported 6 cases of bloody
diarrhea (DS) and 2 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). An
epidemiological investigation was immediately implemented in order to
identify the source of the cluster. Between 22 Jun and 8 Jul 2011, 9
cases of HUS, 9 cases of bloody diarrhea, and 1 case of simple
diarrhea have been identified.

Among these 19 cases, 12 participated on 8 Jun 2011 in an open day at
a recreation center for early childhood (CLPE) in Begles. These 12
people are 7 women and 5 men ranging in age from 6 to 64 years. All
reported having consumed sprouted seeds during the event and began
experiencing symptoms between 13 and 20 Jun 2011.

Among the 5 cases with no established link to the CLPE event, the
microbiological results available to this day for 3 of these cases (1
case of HUS and 2 cases of simple diarrhea) showed that they had not
been infected by _E. coli_ O104:H4 and are therefore excluded. Among
these 3 cases excluded, a person with HUS, who was not infected by
O104:H4, died on 2 Jul 2011.

In total, to this day 11 Jul 2011, 12 cases are directly linked with
the CLPE, 1 case of simple diarrhea without link with the CLPE is
under investigation, and 2 cases of _E. coli_ O104:H4 are confirmed,
indicating secondary transmission has occurred.

The national reference center for _E. coli_ and _Shigella_ (Pasteur
Institute, Paris) and its associated laboratory (laboratory of
microbiology at the Hospital Robert Debre, Paris) compared by
molecular typing the strains of _E. coli_ O104:H4 isolated in 3 French
patients with the strains isolated from patients related to the
epidemic of EHEC [enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_] infections due to
consumption of sprouted seeds that occurred in Germany in May and June
2011.

This comparison showed that the strains isolated from French patients
were indistinguishable from the strains isolated from German patients.
This therefore suggests that these 2 events are connected to a common
source.

A cohort study covering all persons who participated in the open day
at CLPE began on 29 Jun 2011, aimed at documenting this episode from
the epidemiological and clinical points of view.

The Directorate General for Food has conducted a survey of
traceability to determine the origin of the seeds (mustard, rocket, or
fenugreek) consumed during the open day. Samples of seeds to germinate
are in the course of microbiological analysis.

[3] USA ex Germany: fatality
Date: Fri 8 Jul 2011

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43688179/ns/health-food_safety/


The death of an Arizona man and 5 other USA cases of _E. coli_
[O104:H4] infection were caused by the deadly foodborne outbreak that
has ravaged Europe, federal health officials confirmed Fri 8 Jul
2011.

The death of the man, who had recently visited Germany, is the 1st
fatality outside Europe connected to the outbreak that has killed 50
in the EU, according to the CDC. Officials didn't identify him, but
said he was older than 65 and lived in Northern Arizona.

Overall, 6 cases of confirmed infection with Shiga toxin-producing
_E. coli_ 0104:H4 have been confirmed in the USA, the CDC said. They
include 5 people who recently traveled to Germany. Another victim
likely became ill from close contact with a traveler.
