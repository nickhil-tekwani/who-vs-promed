Regarding the presence of herpesvirus in the wild, Laura Richman is
correct and Joe Dudley is incorrect. Elephantid herpesvirus 1 (ElHV1)
has been found in a wild elephant in Asia. See:
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=16841568>

Dr. Dudley also overstates the present knowledge of these viruses.
While it is a viable theory that elephantid herpesvirus 1 is of
African elephant origin, it is far from proven. Significant
ElHV1-associated disease in elephants tends to be found in weaning
age animals, and this is not necessarily inconsistent with the
behavior of some herpesviruses in their native hosts. Further, in
some recent deaths, the virus found to be the cause of death was not
elephantid herpesvirus 1, but a distinct and novel endotheliotropic
herpesvirus, and this novel virus has not been associated with
African elephants.

There is significant diversity of herpesviruses within elephants, as
within most well investigated mammals. A recent study in which we
described an additional 4 elephantid herpesviruses:
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=17884307>

Native habitat for Asian elephants is rapidly disappearing, and it is
reasonable to expect this trend to accelerate. Given current market
forces and human behavior, there is little that will realistically be
done about this. Asian elephant populations are already a fraction of
African elephant populations. This species may well become extinct in
the wild in the not too distant future, along with many other native
Asian species. I agree that we need to do all that we can to maintain
the health of elephant populations. Maintaining healthy captive
breeding populations in North America and Europe, where there are
significant financial resources, is an important part of this. Animal
welfare efforts should be directed toward insisting on improved
conditions for captive elephants, rather than their eradication. The
path advocated by IDA (In Defense of Animals) leads toward the
extinction of these charismatic, social, and highly intelligent
animals.
