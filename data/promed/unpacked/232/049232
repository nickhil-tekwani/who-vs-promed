The Madhya Pradesh government has declared Gwalior district as a controlled area over fears [of a] glanders epidemic. Glanders is a fatal disease affecting equidae, transferable and equally dangerous to humans.

Seven horses have died in the area in the last 60 days due to this infectious disease, forcing authorities to put the horses unit of the Border Security Force and state's Special Armed Forces in Gwalior on high alert. Hundreds of blood samples have been sent to the National Research Centre on Equines, Hisar, for investigations, said sources. State government may think of mass culling of animals to control the infection.

The government has announced an embargo on movement of these animals, stating: "No carrier of goods or animals shall carry any animal of the equine species (donkey, horses and mules) from or out of a controlled area, free area, or infected area by land, sea or air." This order prohibits the movement of animals belonging to the equine species from the place where they are kept to any other place within or outside the municipal area and also prohibits the holding of races, fairs, exhibitions, games and gathering of such animals in the municipal area of Gwalior.

"Seven horses have died since the disease was detected in January this year [2017]. Cases are sporadic, and preventive action is being taken," O P Tripathi, deputy director of the animal husbandry department, Gwalior, told TOI. The disease is characterized by serial development of ulcerating nodules that are most commonly found in the upper respiratory tract, lungs and skin.

The matter surfaced last month [February 2017] when a horse was being treated at a Gwalior veterinary hospital. "As the horse was not responding to treatment, doctors discussed the matter with the veterinary university at Jabalpur. They examined the samples and confirmed it as a case of glanders," said Dr Tripathi. He said 119 samples were sent to Hisar for examination; 6 were found positive. "Two horses died in the meantime. Bodies were disposed as per the protocol," said the vet.

Officials believe there are around 70 Tongas (single-horse driven vehicles) in Gwalior, and some of the horses were brought in from Uttar Pradesh. "It seems that infected horses were brought to Bhopal from the neighbouring state," said a doctor.

District collector Sanjay Goyal also had a meeting with government officers and directed them to be vigilant. "We are taking all possible measures to stop this disease from spreading," Goyal told TOI.

Union minister Menaka Gandhi had been claiming that India was in the middle of a dire glanders epidemic. From 2006 onwards, ICA National Research Centre on Equines has found hundreds of cases across 9 states. Madhya Pradesh is now the 10th state where samples have tested positive for glanders.

According to Dr Tripathi, glanders can be passed on to humans through contact with infected animals, and/or consuming food or water contaminated by the nasal discharges of the animal. "Human cases of glanders are rare. Transmission to humans only happens where a human has been in close contact with infected animals which are showing clear signs of the disease," he said.

[The following summary on glanders, an OIE-listed zoonotic disease of equidae, is derived from chapter 2.5.11 of OIE's terrestrial manual, updated in 2015:

"Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules, caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as 'farcy'. Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. As _B. mallei_ can be transmitted to humans, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a biorisk analysis.

"Identification of the agent:
Smears from fresh material may reveal Gram negative, nonsporulating, nonencapsulated rods. The presence of a capsule-like cover has been demonstrated by electron microscopy. The bacteria grow aerobically and prefer media that contain glycerol. Unlike _Pseudomonas_ species and the closely related bacterium _B. pseudomallei_, _B. mallei_ is nonmotile. Commercially available biochemical identification kits lack diagnostic sensitivity. Specific monoclonal antibodies and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as real-time PCR assays are available.

"Serological tests:
Complement fixation test is an accurate and reliable serological method for diagnostic use. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays show promise once their validation is complete. A rose bengal plate agglutination test has been developed. The immunoblot test based on a crude formalin preparation of _B. mallei_ antigens from isolates of different geographical regions is also a sensitive and specific assay. Mallein test: The mallein test is a hypersensitivity test against _B. mallei_. The test is not generally recommended because of animal welfare concerns, however it can be useful in remote endemic areas where sample transport or proper cooling of samples is not possible. Mallein, a water soluble protein fraction of the organism, is injected intradermo-palpebrally. In infected animals, the eyelid swells markedly within 1-2 days.

"Requirements for vaccines and diagnostic biologicals:
There are no vaccines. Mallein purified protein derivative is currently available commercially."

According to India's annual reports to the OIE, 2010-2014, the annual number of recorded glanders outbreaks (in equidae) countrywide was as follows: 2010 -- 1, 2011 -- 3, 2012 -- 1, 2013 -- 1, 2014 -- 0, 2015 -- 5, (annual 2016 report for animals not yet available). No statistics on the incidence of glanders in humans in India could be obtained. - Mod.AS
