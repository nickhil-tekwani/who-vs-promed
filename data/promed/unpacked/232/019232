A total of 36 persons contracted Lyme disease via tick bites [so far
in 2009?].

Every day during the peak [period] of tick activity, epidemiologists
examine about 300 ticks that have been brought in for investigation.
Mass natural foci of ticks have been found in the Slavyanivsky
district, Krasniy Liman, Druzhkovka, and Konstantinovka.
Epidemiologists also say that natural foci of ticks have been found in
the "Kleban-bull" park, Velikoanadolsky forest, and in the Putylovsky
forest in Donetsk.

[Lyme disease has been recorded in many regions of Ukraine - Kiev,
Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk and other regions. In Russia this disease has
been recorded in 72 regions. The area in which Lyme disease is
reported is larger than that of tick-borne encephalitis. - Mod.NP]

Ukraine: (DON) 20080723.2234:

Lyme borreliosis has been reported in all administrative regions of
Ukraine with an 'increasing tendency'. The hard tick _Ixodes ricinus_
has been found to be the main vector of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ there.

Abstract:
---------
Cases of human Lyme borreliosis (LB) are registered in all
administrative regions of Ukraine and in the Autonomous Republic of
Crimea with an increasing tendency. The hard tick Ixodes ricinus was
proved as the main vector of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., the causative
agents of LB. We identified active natural LB foci, in which almost
25 percent of the adult I. ricinus ticks contained borrelias and more
than 30 percent of the human population were seropositive for Lyme
borreliae. The role of Mus musculus, Microtus arvalis, Myodes
glareolus, Apodemus agrarius, and A. sylvaticus in the transmission
cycle of the LB agent(s) was revealed. Combined foci and cases of
LB/TBE (tick-borne encephalitis) mixed infection were registered in 8
oblasts. A considerable spectrum of different clinical manifestations
of LB has been found including erythema migrans [red patches on the
skin that move around] in 64.9 percent of cases, neurologic symptoms
in 26.1 percent, rheumatic affliction in 24.7 percent, and
cardiovascular problems in 8.3 percent.

Donetsk province is located in eastern Ukraine and can be found on the map at

Slavyansk, Krasniy Liman, Druzhkovka, and Konstantinovka are cities
in Donetsk province - Mod.ML]
