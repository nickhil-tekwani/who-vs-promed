In the ProMED-mail posting of 6 Aug 2009 titled "Influenza pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 (24): global update, archive number 20090805.2766" Maria
Teresa Cerqueira, head of the Pan-American Health Organization office
in La Jolla, California, is quoted as saying that, "In the United
States Tamiflu is sold with a prescription, but in Mexico and Canada
it is sold freely and taken at the 1st sneeze. Then, when it is
really needed, it doesn't work." This statement is incorrect. In
fact, Tamiflu is not sold freely in Canada. In Canada, individuals
must have a prescription written by a physician in order to purchase
Tamiflu from a pharmacy as is the case in the United States.

erroneous statement. - Mod.CP]
