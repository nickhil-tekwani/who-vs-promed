Hundreds of dead seals in Labrador
----------------------------------
People on the north coast of Labrador say scores of dead seals have
been washing ashore since early December [2010].

A conservation officer with the area's Inuit government estimated late
last week [week of 10 Jan 2011] that hundreds of adult and young seals
have died in the area between Hopedale and Makkovik this winter
[2010-2011].

The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) is testing the carcasses,
but Nunatsiavut [autonomous area claimed by the Inuit in Newfoundland
and Labrador] conservation officer Ian Winters said many people in the
area believe DFO hasn't acted quickly enough.

Usually at this time of year seals are on sea ice south of Hopedale,
said Winters, but he said there is very little ice there now.

Last month [December 2010], people in northern Labrador found the
bodies of dead seal pups on the coast. At the time, a federal seal
researcher said the early birth of seal pups in Labrador may be an
indication the area's seal population has grown too large. DFO
researcher Garry Stenson said that seal population growth could lead
to reproductive problems. "What you expect in a population that is
starting to regulate itself are things like lower reproductive rates
and variable reproductive rates, but also higher pup mortality and
also higher juvenile mortality," he said Monday [17 Jan 2011] in St.
John's.

Stenson said the harp seal population of Atlantic Canada is now at
between 8 and 9 million. A 2004 assessment of seal stocks estimated
the harp seal population in the area at between 4.6 and 7.2 million.

Stenson said the DFO received 5 reports of seals giving birth on the
coast of Labrador in December [2010], although the nomadic sea mammals
normally give birth in late February or early March.
He said the early births are happening on land rather than ice floes
and it's unlikely the newborn pups will survive.

[So the question may be, why are they birthing on land, not on the ice
flows? Are the pups premature? What has induced labor?

More than just looking at populations, why not do a necropsy on the
seal pups and see if there is something there? Are there any viruses
that cause abortion? How long are the pups living and are they full
term? Are they nursing? It seems these are basic investigative
questions that should be answered.

Hopefully an authoritative report will be conducted and results
released soon. - Mod.TG]
