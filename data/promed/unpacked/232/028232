[3] USA: mpox emergency declaration to end
Date: Fri 2 Dec 2022
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/world/us/united-states-end-mpox-emergency-declaration-2022-12-02/


Mpox is expected to no longer be considered a public health emergency in the United States from 1 Feb 2023, the US health department said on Friday [2 Dec 2022].

The months-long declaration was meant to tackle the largest-ever outbreak of cases in the country. The move signals that the crisis, which led to a spate of cases mostly among men who have sex with men, has come under control and would no longer require an emergency status meant to shore up funding and tools to fight the disease.

"Given the low number of cases today, HHS does not expect that it needs to renew the emergency declaration when it ends on January 31, 2023," US Health Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement on Friday [2 Dec 2022]. "But we won't take our foot off the gas. We will continue to monitor the case trends closely and encourage all at-risk individuals to get a free vaccine."

President Joe Biden's administration declared mpox a public health emergency in August [2022] after the country recorded over 6000 cases and as the government came under pressure for its handling of the outbreak.

Cases have been in decline since mid-August [2022] in the country, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last month [November 2022].

The World Health Organization recently named the virus mpox to replace the older term monkeypox, citing concerns of stigma and racism associated with it.

WHO had said in November [2022] that the disease continues to represent a global health emergency, but also acknowledged progress made in the global response to the outbreak.

The WHO label, a "public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)," is designed to trigger a coordinated international response and could unlock funding to collaborate on sharing vaccines and treatments.

The disease, which is endemic in parts of Africa, began spreading in Europe earlier this year [2022] before moving to the United States.

A rollout of Bavarian Nordic's (BAVA.CO) Jynneos, the only approved monkeypox vaccine, and heightened awareness of the risks of the disease as well as increased immunity appear to have slowed the spread and helped bring cases under control.

Infectious disease experts say that years of financial neglect has left sexual health clinics -- which are on the frontline of the current mpox response -- ill-prepared to curb further spread.

[One hopes that since Mpox will longer be considered a public health emergency in the United States as of 1 Feb 2023, there will not be a decline of educational efforts among MSM or of vaccination of individuals at risk. The ending of the health emergency does not indicate that the virus if gone or that there will no longer be cases. - Mod. TY]

[4] Spain: mpox in women
Date: 1 Thu Dec 2022

Mpox (formerly monkeypox) in women: epidemiological features and clinical characteristics of mpox cases in Spain, April to November 2022. Euro Surveill. 2022; 27(48): pii=2200867; https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.48.2200867.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most cases in Spain and other countries have occurred in men who have sex with men (MSM). However, cases in other population groups, such as women, have also been identified. In this study we [characterize] the mpox cases among women using national surveillance data and explore differences with cases among men to provide information for a better understanding of the disease's dynamics.

Mpox surveillance in Spain and analysis performed in this study
------------------------------------------------------------------
This analysis includes all confirmed cases (detection of the monkeypox virus (MPXV) genome by specific or generic PCR for _Orthopoxvirus_ in a clinical sample) in Spain that have been collected following the detection and control protocols established by the National Surveillance Network that covers all regions of the country. A [standardized] form was used by local epidemiologists when interviewing the cases and included sociodemographic variables such as sex (dichotomic man/woman), clinical features, and risk factors and exposures.

We conducted a descriptive analysis of the variables included in the form. We excluded all cases younger than 16 years, as the circumstances of the disease in children would require different analysis than those in adults. Comparisons of qualitative variables were studied using the chi-squared test, quantitative variables using the Mann-Whitney U test. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to adjust measured odds ratio (OR) by sexual transmission mechanism.

Discussion
-------
Cases of mpox reported in women in Spain represent more than 1/3 of all cases in women notified in Europe. During the weeks of increasing incidence in Spain (April to July 2022), cases among women were very rare. However, once the disease spread outside the initial clusters and its incidence was close to its maximum, cases among women followed a similar time distribution as cases among men but at a much lower level. As detected in most countries, the main group at risk are MSM who have high-risk sexual relationships. Although transmission may happen in other groups, including women, our finding suggests that the monkeypox virus infection has not spread widely to the general population.

One of the main strengths of our study is that we used national surveillance data, including all reported mpox cases in Spain with the early availability of a [standardized] protocol and an epidemiological form that increased homogeneity of notifications. However, one of the main limitations is the fact that the epidemiological form included, as in all diseases under surveillance in the National Surveillance Network framework, a dichotomous variable for sex, which is a key variable in this analysis. This may have introduced gender misclassification bias in our study. Thornhill et al. classified women as trans, cis, and non-binary, finding differences related to gender identity that we could not identify, and possibly causing an underestimation of the weight of sexual contact as a method of transmission and the overall risk for women and specifically trans women in our study. In addition, cases were interviewed by many different local epidemiologists, who may have different sensitivity in the information collected for each case. Finally, the number of women among the patients available for analysis was relatively small, although to our knowledge it is the largest available in literature.

Women were diagnosed later than men, which can be explained by several factors. Given the low-risk perception present in the general population, women may have been less likely to associate their symptoms with mpox, thus delaying consulting and testing. Healthcare practitioners may also introduce gender bias in their clinical suspicion of mpox. Previous authors also described symptoms in women, finding comparable results in the frequency of general symptoms, lymphadenopathies and oral lesions, but higher percentage of anogenital [exanthema] and any mucosal [exanthema].

HIV prevalence rates in mpox cases were significantly higher than the estimated prevalence of HIV in the adult population in Spain (0.1% in women, 0.6% in men). This suggests that both men and women with MPXV infection are subgroups with characteristics different from the general population.

As for symptoms, we found in the bivariate analysis statistically significant differences between men and women concerning all non-oral rashes, appearing in different locations, but no differences in general signs and symptoms. These differences remain after adjusting for the transmission mode. Keeping in mind the limitations regarding gender classification previously stated, these differences could be explained by several reasons such as a potential difference in exposures and risks concerning sexual practices (e.g., oral, vaginal, and anal sex) that may [favor] transmission, which is an unknown variable that could not be adjusted for.

Conclusions
-------
To our knowledge, our study describes the largest sample of women with MPXV infection in the available literature. We found that the risk of transmission of mpox in this group exists and must be communicated, although it has remained low throughout the outbreak. Our study provides information relevant to the response to this alert, increasing the knowledge in the disease dynamics in women, and shows how surveillance data can be useful in applied public health research to generate and increase the knowledge about the disease during the outbreak response. Further studies with a more complete classification of sexual orientation and gender identity and the collection of certain risk exposures would help complete the understanding of additional differences in the mechanism of transmission, [behavior], and course of the disease in different population groups.

[5] Africa to receive its 1st vaccines
Date: Thu 1 Dec 2022

https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-12-01/africa-receive-first-mpox-monkeypox-vaccines


Africa's top public health body says the continent is set to receive its 1st batch of mpox vaccines as a donation from South Korea. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday [1 Dec 2022] that the 50 000 doses will be used first for health workers and people living in the hardest-hit areas. No timing was given for the doses' arrival.

The continent this year has recorded 202 deaths from mpox -- formerly known as monkeypox -- with a fatality rate of 19.3% across 13 countries. Yet African health authorities for months have pursued vaccines mostly in vain as major outbreaks were reported in richer Western countries for the 1st time.

Acting Africa CDC Director Ahmed Ogwell noted 51 new mpox cases in Congo in the last week and said Ghana and Nigeria are the other countries most affected.

[Mpox virus infection cases are sporadic and occur over a wide geographic area. Other than health care workers who should be vaccinated, it will be a challenge to decide which individuals should receive the vaccine. The available 50 000 doses may not go very far, especially if 2 doses are requires. Nevertheless, this is a good start in providing support for the Mpox endemic areas in Africa. - Mod. TY]

Abstract
-------
Risk for transmission of monkeypox virus (MPXV) (clade IIb) to healthcare workers (HCWs) is low. Although many cases have been reported among HCW, only a few have been occupationally acquired. We report a case of non-needle-stick MPXV transmission to an HCW in the United States.

[7] Monkeypox encephalitis with transverse myelitis in a female patient

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
---------
The 2022 monkeypox outbreak has affected 110 countries worldwide, outside of classic endemic areas (i.e., west Africa and central Africa). On 23 Jul 2022, the outbreak was classified by WHO as a public health emergency of international concern. Clinical presentation varies from mild to life-changing symptoms; neurological complications are relatively uncommon, and there are few therapeutic interventions for monkeypox disease. In this Grand Round, we present a case of monkeypox with encephalitis complicated by transverse myelitis in a previously healthy woman aged 35 years who made an almost complete recovery from her neurological symptoms after treatment with tecovirimat, cidofovir, steroids, and plasma exchange. We describe neurological complications associated with orthopoxvirus infections and laboratory diagnosis, the radiological features in this case, and discuss treatment options.

Introduction
-------
The increase in the number of people with monkeypox outside of classic endemic regions (i.e., west Africa and central Africa) was first noted to WHO by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) on 7 May 2022. Infections were noted in all WHO regions, with 88% of laboratory-confirmed cases being reported from the European region in the 1st 2 months of the outbreak. Previously, only a small number of cases of monkeypox had been observed outside of Africa.

Monkeypox infections were first [recognized] in humans in the 1970s. Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease originally described in primates; to date the definitive animal reservoir (i.e., the animal species that can host the virus without major evidence of disease so that virus transmission is possible) remains unknown. The disease is caused by an orthopox DNA virus. Currently, whole-genome sequencing data divide monkeypox species into clade 1 (previously known as the central African or Congo Basin clade), responsible for endemic infections in central Africa, and clade 2 (previously known as the west African clade), responsible for endemic infections in west Africa. The 2022 outbreak of monkeypox has spread extensively in areas outside of endemic countries due to subclade 2b, and has been shown to disproportionally affect gay and bisexual men who have sex with men. Monkeypox virus infection has an incubation period of 3-21 days and is [characterized] by a prodrome of fever, myalgia, and lethargy, then a characteristic maculopapular rash; it is often a self-limiting illness. However, it has been associated with severe disease, and before the 2022 outbreak had a 3-6% mortality rate.

Clinicians worldwide should be familiar with both the common presentation of genital, skin, and pharyngeal lesions and the rarer, life-threatening complications of monkeypox, such as encephalitis.

Neurological complications have previously been documented in relation to many viral infections of epidemic potential, including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, Zika virus, Ebola virus, smallpox, and monkeypox. Encephalopathy, seizures, stroke, and Guillain-Barré syndrome are all [recognized] as substantial but rare complications which increase both morbidity and mortality. Three documented cases of encephalitis during the 2022 monkeypox outbreak have been fatal.

In this Grand Round, we discuss the case of a female patient with monkeypox infection exacerbated by both encephalitis and transverse myelitis. We highlight the diagnostic tests that were done, the radiological features that were seen, and our rationale for the treatment options chosen.

Conclusion
-------
Because of negative outcomes of the cases of encephalitis in Spain, we would like to highlight the positive outcome in our case with an unusual presentation of neurological sequelae of monkeypox infection. We believe the care of our patient was helped by fast involvement of appropriate national multidisciplinary teams and early initiation of antiviral therapy, alongside active management of transverse myelitis.

Future research
----------------
There is a clear need for ongoing epidemiological surveillance to establish whether the current monkeypox outbreak will lead to transmission into novel animal reservoirs, allowing it to become endemic in countries outside of Africa. Current treatment options have not been evaluated in human clinical trials, and ongoing efforts to evaluate the use of these drugs are currently happening. Vaccination with smallpox vaccines has formed an important part of the public health response to date, but how efficacious this will be against monkeypox virus remains unclear.
