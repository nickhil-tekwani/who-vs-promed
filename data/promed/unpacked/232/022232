Lambs, pigs, goats, cattle, ponies, and rabbit droppings at a Surrey
farm at the center of an _E. coli_ [O157:H7] outbreak have tested
positive for the bacterium. Experts from the Veterinary Laboratories
Agency (VLA) said 33 of 102 samples were likely to contain the O157
strain of the infection.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) said the total number of cases
linked to Godstone Farm had risen to 67. 8 children remain in
hospital in a "stable or improving condition".

The VLA said it visited Godstone Farm on 7 and 16 Sep 2009 and White
Post Farm at Farnsfield, near Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on 18 Sep
2009, at the request of the HPA. It added: "We found that 33 of 102
samples taken on [7 Sep 2009] were likely to be verocytotoxin
producing _E. coli_ (VTEC) O157." But the VLA said the infectious
bacteria were not contained in pond water samples, 6 samples of
sandpit sand, or smaller "pet animals". During its 2nd visit to
Godstone Farm scientists found 2 samples of _E. coli_ O157 on the
floor of the main barn.

Nigel Gibbens, Defra chief veterinary officer, said: "Joint HPA and
VLA investigations have confirmed the presence of _E. coli_ O157
bacteria in feces from a wide range of animals on a premises in
Surrey."

The VLA said 5 of the 121 samples collected from animals at White
Post Farm at Farnsfield, near Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, yielded
"presumptive VTEC O157, representing cows and calves, with no public
access, and housed sheep and goats." The Godstone Farm closed on 12
Sep 2009 and its sister farm, Horton Park Children's Farm in Epsom,
was also shut because of "unsatisfactory" hygiene arrangements.

The outbreak at Godstone Farm near Redhill is believed to have
started on 8 Aug 2009. No cases have been linked to the Epsom site.
White Post Farm was closed after 2 visitors were confirmed to be
suffering from the same strain of _E. coli_. The World of Country
Life in Exmouth, Devon, closed its petting farm and deer ride on
Friday [18 Sep 2009] on the advice of the Health Protection Agency
(HPA).

[It is not clearly stated if by "same strain" it is meant that the
environmental isolates are just O157:H7 or if some are a genetic
match to the outbreak strain or strains. What is meant is likely the
former so it is not sure that there is a "smoking" dropping (that is,
a genetic match in the environmental isolates. - Mod.LL]
