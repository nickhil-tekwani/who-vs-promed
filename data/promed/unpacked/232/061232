[1] USA (New York, Rockland County): unvaccinated children
Date: Fri 5 Apr 2019
Source: CBS (abridged, edited)
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rockland-county-measles-outbreak-judge-lifts-ban-on-unvaccinated-children-today-2019-04-05/


A judge in upstate New York on Friday [5 Apr 2019] lifted the ban on unvaccinated children in public places despite 166 confirmed measles cases, most of which have been in the local ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. According to the judge, the number of measles cases in the county did not meet the legal requirement for an emergency order, CBS New York reports.

Officials in Rockland County, New York, issued an emergency order on 26 Mar [2019] that prohibited unvaccinated children under the age of 18 from going out in public spaces for 30 days. Public places affected by the order included shopping centers, businesses, restaurants, schools, and places of worship.

Attorney Michael Sussman represents a dozen families associated with the private Green Meadow Waldorf School, where many parents have refused to vaccinate their children for religious reasons. He argued in court that the order was "preventing people ... under 18 years old who are perfectly healthy from going to church, going to school, going shopping."

With no measles cases at the school, he called the emergency order restrictions "a perversion. "Those religious exemptions are sacrosanct in New York," he said Thursday [4 Apr 2019].

But State Sen. Brad Hoylman disagreed. "Your right to express your sincerely held belief or your religious belief does not extend to the right to endanger our children and our community from measles," he said.

Rockland County executive Ed Day called the judge's decision "very wrong-headed," CBS New York reports. Day said he feared for the well-being of pregnant women and children, who could suffer life-threatening complications from the highly contagious illness.

In New York, families can claim a religious exemption from vaccination requirements. CBS New York reports a Rockland County state senator is currently sponsoring a bill to eliminate that exemption, as California did in 2015.

"It's very simple: Just remove all nonmedical exemptions. Make it clear and simple to school administrators, make it clear and simple to parents. Cut through the nonsense that's out there and let's govern by the science," State Sen. David Carlucci said. "Or else, we're going to have a real, real problem on our hands, and it's not just going to be isolated to Rockland County or to Brooklyn. Everyone's going to be facing this."

[The judge's decision is unfortunate. Rockland Hasidic rabbis have issued a statement in Hebrew urging parents to vaccinate their children to stop the spread of measles. But this clearly is not sufficient, as people are still claiming religious exemptions. Public health is directed towards protecting the health of the population, including pregnant women, unborn children, children who for health reasons cannot be immunized. This imperative overshadows individual choice.

The economic cost of a measles outbreak is very high. The judge determined the number of cases was not high enough to merit an emergency declaration. But why wait for a full-blown outbreak? Healthcare should be preventative rather than reactive. According to a study published in Journal of American Medical Association*, the cost of responding to a single case of measles can be as high as USD 142 000, depending on the number and location of contacts that must be traced, the amount of postexposure prophylaxis that must be administered, and the number of people quarantined. Furthermore, measles has long-term immunosuppresive effects on the infected individual long after the acute infection is over.

Vaccinations are the biggest bargain and most protective measure for the individual and society.

The outbreak has spread beyond Ocean County, state health department officials said. The measles outbreak in Ocean County, New Jersey, continues to spread: state health department officials say there are now 9 confirmed cases of measles: 7 in Ocean County and 2 in Monmouth County. At least 3 counties have been impacted, officials say.

In an update on the State Department of Health website, officials said they are continuing to track and investigate the outbreak declared 15 Mar [2019]. Those confirmed cases and one "highly suspect case" may have exposed others to infection between 9 Mar and 14 Mar [2019].

[3] USA (California, Davis): emergency department
Date: Thu 4 Apr 2019

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2019/04/04/measles-200-california-emergency-department-may-have-been-exposed/3362282002/


A Sacramento, California, medical center sent letters to about 200 patients, saying they might have been exposed to measles after a girl who visited the emergency department was diagnosed with the highly contagious infection. The young girl with measles visited the emergency department at UC Davis Medical Center on 17 Mar [2019], the center told USA Today on Thursday [4 Apr 2019]. The letters were sent 25 and 26 Mar [2019].

"You will need to notify your primary healthcare provider(s) and your child's provider(s) of this possible exposure to discuss your possible risk of infection, vaccination history, and other questions you may have," the letters read.

The Bee reported the unvaccinated girl from Calaveras County was diagnosed with the measles after medical staff from another medical center said she likely had the flu or a cold virus.

A 7-year-old boy who suffers from a terminal illness was seen in the same room as the girl with measles before doctors closed the room to be cleaned, UC Davis' chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Dean Blumberg told CBS13. The boy was not showing signs of the measles as of his last evaluation on Tuesday [2 Apr 2019], Blumberg said in a statement.

Measles is so contagious that 90% of unvaccinated people who come in contact with an infected person will get the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The measles 2-dose vaccine is 97% effective against the virus, according to the CDC.

[7] Israel: origin of outbreak Ukraine
Date: Wed 3 Apr 2019

http://healthmap.org/ln.php?6402690&u8901


Israel's measles outbreak took off in September [2018] after thousands of mostly Hasidic Orthodox pilgrims brought the virus back from Uman, Ukraine.

Tens of thousands of Jews gather in the central Ukrainian city each year on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, near what many believe is the burial site of Rabbi Nachman, an 18th-century luminary.

Ukraine's measles outbreak began in 2017 and has had almost 70 000 cases, the New York Times reported Wednesday [3 Apr 2019]. In late September [2018], following Rosh Hashanah and the annual Uman pilgrimage, measles cases exploded in Israel, to 949 in October, according to the newspaper, citing Dr. Patrick O'Connor, leader of the rapid disease control team at the WHO's European office, which oversees Israel. The cause is believed to be the numerous pilgrims who returned from Ukraine with the virus.

Meanwhile, a measles outbreak in New York began in October [2018] with a child in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn who had visited Israel. Also in October [2018], an outbreak began among Orthodox Jews in London.

Israel's measles outbreak began in March 2018, according to O'Conner, in a small Orthodox community in Safed, in the northern part of the country.

Orthodox Jews in Israel for the most part do not have a problem with vaccines, which are provided free there. However, large Orthodox families often are not careful about making sure all their children have their vaccinations.

Vaccination rates among the Orthodox in Israel are in the 80% range, and the virus spreads quicker as Orthodox children attend more life-cycle events such as weddings and circumcisions, giving them more opportunity to be exposed.

[8] Australia (New South Wales): 30th case
Date: Thu 4 Apr 2019

https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/nsw-measles-cases-hit-30-young-woman-infected-by-stranger-in-clinic-20190404-p51axz.html


A young woman has become the 30th person to be diagnosed with measles in NSW since Christmas [2018]. The alert comes days after 2 babies too young to be vaccinated caught the infection from strangers in public areas in Sydney, as Australia creeps towards a 5-year record-high number of cases.

The woman likely acquired the highly contagious infection in the waiting room of a medical practice in Eastwood in mid-March [2019]. She was at the clinic the same time as a patient who was infectious after contracting measles on a trip to Thailand.

Before she was diagnosed, the woman visited a number of public locations and travelled on public transport while infectious.

They are highly contagious and responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of children worldwide: the measles! Now the disease is on the rise in the region as well.

Update from 5 Apr [2019]: As the district Germersheim tells, there are also 2 cases of measles here. According to press releases, among the patients there is a woman in her mid-20s. A 3rd suspicion has not been confirmed. The health department has taken all necessary measures.

Update from 29 Mar [2019]: The district Sudliche Weinstrasse warns of a measles outbreak. Currently, the number of confirmed measles cases is increasing. A total of 13 confirmed measles cases already exist on the Southern Wine Route and in Landau. According to the district, the people suffering from measles are between 20 and 83 years old.

The background of the outbreak is currently being investigated. The health department has identified many contact persons in recent weeks with the help of affected families and employers. "We have found that the affected companies have informed their employees in an exemplary manner and have taken the necessary steps to clarify the immune status," said Dietmar Seefeldt.

Announcement from 28 Mar [2019]: In the middle of March [2019], children had to be expelled from the kindergarten because of the suspicion of measles. Now there is an all-clear: The measles suspected cases could not be confirmed by an additional health check in the National Reference Center. This is confirmed by Silke Hartmann, head of the Landratsamt Rhein-Neckar-Kreis on Wednesday (27 Mar 2019). The children were allowed to visit the kindergarten within a few days.

However, this year there is a confirmed measles case in Heidelberg and the Rhein-Neckar-Kreis. This was not related to the incidents in kindergarten.

Update from 27 Mar [2019]: The concern in the Federal Ministry about the increase in contagious measles is great. Although the disease in Germany should actually be eradicated, it always comes back to major outbreaks. The grand coalition is now even considering compulsory vaccination for children.

This year [2019], there were 170 measles diseases in the entire country, many of them in North Rhine-Westphalia. Often there are outbreaks of measles in cities or metropolitan areas. The measles virus is extremely contagious and is transmitted by droplets. According to the Robert Koch Institute, a death occurs in every 1000 cases. In infants, the number is even worse: one in every 300 children dies of measles.

Announcement of 15 Mar [2019]: "The measles are on the rise again." This disturbing message on Wed [13 Mar 2019] [was made by] the district council [of] Rhein-Nekar-Kreis. As early as this year [2019] there are 30 reported cases in Baden-Wurttemberg, 13 of them at the beginning of March [2019].

In the Rhein-Neckar-Kreis, children are already excluded from the kindergarten because of the suspicion of measles and the lack of adequate vaccination protection. "For the parents, this means a high level of care and a loss at the workplace. These consequences could have been avoided by adequate immunization," said Dr. Schwertz. According to Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung, 2 kindergartens from the region are affected.

Dubliners are being urged to stay vigilant after the HSE confirmed there have been 10 cases of measles in the city since February [2019]. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre pushed out a tweet this evening reminding the public of the outbreak and asking them to remain steadfast. Ten cases had been confirmed in Dublin since the start of February.

Recent cases involved young adults working in Dublin city centre in the areas of Parnell Street, Dame Street, and Baggot Street.

The HSE last month [March 2019] confirmed an outbreak in Dublin and advised people who think they have measles to stay at home and to contact their GP for advice.

Travel to France was identified as a risk.

A measles outbreak has been detected among students at a Catholic school in Saint-Tropez and their entourage, [sources agreed on] Wed 3 Apr [2019]. Three people had to be hospitalized. In most cases, the children were not properly vaccinated.

An epidemic of measles is rife in the Sainte-Anne school of Saint-Tropez. A 1st case was declared 14 Feb [2019], then another 16 [cases] followed in this Catholic primary school under contract with the state. "At 26 Mar [2019], we had a group of 17 [infected] people in Saint-Tropez," said the Regional Health Agency (ARS).

The children are around 5 years old. Of this total, only one of them had been properly vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR, the agency said, while 3 people were hospitalized.

"The situation is completely under control, but we are reminding people of the importance of getting vaccinated," said the health agency. Contacted by AFP, the town hall of Saint-Tropez made no comment, and the private school Sainte-Anne did not wish to respond.

Like last year [2018], the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region is among the most affected by measles, with 84 cases recorded on 2 Apr [2019]. About 1/3 of the patients had to be hospitalized, and 7 had complications. Measles is a childhood disease. Vaccination has been compulsory since 1 Jan 2018.

In a vacation home in the ski resort of Foux d'Allos, in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, where about 20 people were infected, the virus is still ongoing. A vaccination session has been organized in the station.

[12] Surge in activity

https://www.forbes.com/sites/unicefusa/2019/04/03/alarming-global-surge-of-measles-cases-is-a-wake-up-call/#6a96e3fd2236


More contagious than Ebola, tuberculosis, or influenza, the potentially deadly measles virus is on the rise. Globally, measles cases increased by 48.1% between 2017 and 2018, according to data on 194 countries from the World Health Organization (WHO).

The virus spreads through the air and can be contracted by someone up to 2 hours after an infected person has left a room. Malnourished children and babies too young to be vaccinated are particularly vulnerable. Up to 90% of nonimmunized people who are exposed to the virus will also become infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Alarmingly high levels of measles cases have been reported around the world: 98 countries noted an increase in 2018. Ten countries account for more than 74% of the total surge: Ukraine, the Philippines, Brazil, Yemen, Venezuela, Serbia, Madagascar, Sudan, Thailand, and France. The disease has even reappeared in several countries where it was once declared eliminated, including the United States.

UNICEF and partners are responding to the current measles outbreaks by supporting governments to urgently reach millions of children in countries around the globe, providing ongoing support to accelerate routine immunization and address vaccine hesitancy, which the WHO declared one of the top 10 threats to global health in 2019.

Ukraine
In Ukraine alone, there were 35 120 cases of measles in 2018, up 634% from 4782 in 2017. According to the government, another 24 042 people were infected in just the first 2 months of 2019.

Yemen
In Yemen, where 4 years of civil war have severely strained the healthcare system, a campaign to vaccinate children against measles and other potentially life-threatening infectious diseases reached more than 11.5 million children in January [2019] alone.

Madagascar
"This is a wake-up call," said UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore. "We have a safe, effective, and inexpensive vaccine against a highly contagious disease, a vaccine that has saved almost a million lives every year over the past two decades. These cases haven't happened overnight. Just as the serious outbreaks we are seeing today took hold in 2018, lack of action today will have disastrous consequences for children tomorrow."

UNICEF vaccinates nearly half the world's children. Immunization is one of the most cost-effective public health interventions to date, saving up to 3 million lives every year.

[13] Vaccine wars
Date: Sat 6 Apr 2019
Source: Inquirer (abridged, edited)
https://usa.inquirer.net/26716/social-media-vs-outbreak-of-bogus-claims-vaccine-wars


The digital scrapbooking site Pinterest -- which has been a leading online repository of vaccine misinformation -- in 2017 took the seemingly drastic step of blocking all searches for the term "vaccines," affecting even legitimate searches for information. It was part of the company's enforcement of a broader policy against health misinformation.

But it's been a leaky quarantine. Recently, a search for "measles vaccine" still brought up, among other things, a post titled "Why We Said No to the Measles Vaccine," along with a sinister-looking illustration of a hand holding an enormous needle titled, "Vaccine-nation: Poisoning the population one shot at a time." Search results for "vaccine safety" and "flu vaccine" can turn up posts with scientifically debunked information.

Facebook, meanwhile, said in March [2019] it will no longer recommend groups and pages that spread hoaxes about vaccines, and that it will reject ads that do this. This appears to have filtered out some of the most blatant sources of vaccine misinformation, such as the Natural News website (https://naturalnews.com/), which had regularly posted anti-vaccine propaganda and showed up high in Facebook searches about the topic.

But even after the changes, groups -- such as one with 197 members and more than 10 posts a day seeking to "discuss the dangers of vaccination" -- was among the 1st results for a search on "vaccine safety." A more generic "vaccine" search, meanwhile, turns up the verified profile of Dr. Christiane Northrup, a high-profile physician who's outspoken about her misgivings about -- and at times opposition to -- vaccines. On Facebook's Instagram, hashtags such as "vaccineskill" and accounts against vaccinating children are easily found with a simple search for "vaccines."

In social media's battle against misinformation, bogus claims about the dangers of vaccines are the next target. With some dangerous childhood diseases making a comeback due to lower vaccination rates, Facebook, Pinterest, and others are trying to put the genie back in the bottle, even as they are hesitant to acknowledge responsibility for spreading falsehoods.

"There has been hesitancy about vaccines as long as vaccines have existed," said Jeanine Guidry, professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who studies social media and vaccines.

Still, experts in online misinformation say the impact of social networking and its unfiltered, algorithmically boosted dissemination of the most "engaging" posts -- whether true or not -- have fueled a much broader spread of anti-vaccination propaganda. Richard Carpiano, a professor of public policy and sociology at the University of California, Riverside, who studies vaccine trends, said there is a "disproportionate" number of websites on the topic with misinformation, peddled by "anti-vax activists" and parent bloggers. Researchers have even found Russia-linked bots trying to sow discord by amplifying both sides of the vaccine debate.

Carpiano noted that even with anti-vaccination activists getting a large share of the public's attention, much more common are parents who are merely hesitant or concerned about immunization. Understandably, they seek out information, and a lot of what they find is false.

"It is a misinformation campaign," he said. "Often couched in 'Oh, we are for choice, understanding, education,'" he said. "But fundamentally, it is not open to scientific debate."
