Western Bahr al-Ghazal State investigates [ebolavirus] outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------------
The West Bahr al-Ghazal State government in collaboration with
international medical practitioners today [15 Oct 2009] says they are
trying to reach the remote village of Kitkit to investigate reports of an
Ebola [hemorrhagic fever] outbreak in the region. 23 people, among them 20
soldiers of the southern Sudan army, died of an unexplained disease
suspected to be Ebola hemorrhagic fever earlier this month [October 2009]
the Southern Sudan Army said. However further investigation should be done
[to confirm this].

Ebola hemorrhagic fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever. There are 4 [now 5. -
Mod.CP] recognized species within the genus _Ebolavirus_, which in turn
include [a number of species]. The _Zaire virus_ is the type species, which
was also the first discovered and the most lethal. _Sudan ebolavirus_ is
the 2nd species of the _Ebolavirus_ genus that emerged almost simultaneous
with the _Zaire virus_.

"We have organized ourselves into teams and plan to go to the area to fully
investigate what caused the death of the 4 Sudan People's Liberation Army
(SPLA) soldiers besides 4 other civilians in the area in both August and
September 2009," said the state minister of information and communications,
Efesio Kon Uguak. The minister, speaking from the town of Wau, reiterated
that reports from the State Ministry of Health indicate that at least 4
people have died and several others are showing symptoms of some type of
viral hemorrhagic fever.

The State Ministry of Health report also revealed the deaths of 6 soldiers
allegedly believed to be members of the SPLA stationed around the village
of Kitkit in Western Bahr al-Ghazal state. They were found bleeding from
the nose and vomiting blood, the report indicates.

Similarly, major general Kuol Deim Kuol, the SPLA official spokesperson,
acknowledged in an interview with members of press the death of another 20
soldiers including 3 wives [of] these soldiers in Bahr al-Ghazal of a
disease suspected to be Ebola hemorrhagic fever. However, Kuol made no
mention of the place where the incident occurred, adding that he feared a
large number of the population may also be infected if immediate medical
intervention is not taken.

Even though the symptoms may appear to be that of Ebola hemorrhagic fever,
medical practitioners will not be able to determine which hemorrhagic fever
virus is causing the disease until they can investigate suspected cases in
Kitkit, said a medical doctor from the World Health Organization in Juba
earlier in September 2009. The medical practitioner identified as Dr
Formenty, added that there are several types of viruses that cause similar
symptoms -- high fever and bleeding from openings in the body. Some viruses
cause relatively mild illnesses, while others such as _Ebolavirus_ and
_Marburgvirus_, often kill their host, immediately if no proper medical
attention is given. The practitioner said they did not exclude a long list
of possible diseases that might be the cause of the death of 4 SPLA
soldiers and 4 civilians in Kitkit. However, the doctors' plans to
investigate the real cause [have been affected] by heavy of rain in this
area. Roads were badly affected and a helicopter could not land as the
village of Kitkit is deep in the forest.

Earlier minister Uguak said that [information] from the state Ministry of
Health indicates that the last ebolavirus outbreak in southern Sudan
occurred in 2004. The disease, one of the most feared in the world, killed
7 people and infected 17 others before it was contained more than a month
later.

Rains and poor roads hamper mystery disease response
----------------------------------------------------
Efforts to identify a haemorrhagic disease that has killed 4 people in a
remote corner of Southern Sudan have been thwarted by bad roads made
impassable by heavy rainfall, according to officials.

The deaths took place in Kitkit, a military outpost in Western Bahr
al-Ghazal state. On 23 Sep 2009, the state's director-general of health,
Martin Mayen Wol, had written to Southern Sudan's health ministry in Juba
to report the deaths and that 6 soldiers were complaining of nose bleeds
and vomiting blood. "As there are no means to verify the situation and
confirm their condition due to the bad roads attributed to the rainy
season, we ask your esteemed office for direct intervention through the
international and UN bodies," wrote Wol. "The situation is urgent, Sir."

A team from Southern Sudan's health ministry, WHO, and the Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA) could only get as far as Timsah, 70 km [about 45 mi]
away. "... not even a vehicle could move," Nathan Atem, the
director-general of Preventive Medicine, said. "They had to come back."

Without a landing strip, Kitkit is inaccessible even to aircraft. A doctor
sent to the region on a flight with the UN Mission in Sudan, following an
appeal for help issued in late September [2009], had to turn back. Blood
samples of those infected have been sent to the US Centers for Disease
Control labs in Atlanta for analysis.

Ministry of Health under-secretary Majok Yak Majok played down fears that
Ebola haemorrhagic fever might be to blame for the deaths: "It could be any
other disease that can cause bleeding," said Majok. "For a serious
outbreak, it could have not remained [as] contained since 23 Sep 2009." He
noted that if it was a viral infection it would have engulfed the entire
region in the 3 weeks.

[There is some confusion about the number of individuals affected and the
nature of the unidentified disease. It appears now that a few civilians in
the village of Kitkit have been affected in addition to the soldiers of the
Southern Sudan Army and some of their wives. The only positive news is that
blood samples have been sent to the US CDC in Atlanta for analysis,
although it is not clear how this has been achieved since attempts to reach
the affected area have been thwarted by heavy rain and its remoteness.

There is no firm evidence that the deaths and illnesses have been caused by
Ebola hemorrhagic fever virus infection. Fever and hemorrhage can be caused
by a number of agents, which can best be distinguished on the basis of
laboratory analysis.
