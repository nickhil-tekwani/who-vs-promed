Verticillium wilt on the rise in Salinas Valley lettuce
-------------------------------------------------------
As the spread of verticillium wilt of lettuce accelerated this season
in California's Salinas Valley, plant pathologists and breeders
stepped up their quest for ways to control it.

Research leader Krishna Subbarao, University of California, said,
"The wilt was very active this year [2008], and since it was first
discovered 13 years ago, there was never a year in which so many new
lettuce fields succumbed to it." By early October [2008], he added,
13 new fields picked up the disease, bringing infected acreage in the
Valley to more than 1500 acres (607 ha). Typically, during each of
the past several years only 4 to 6 new fields were found to be
infected.

The majority of incidence is around Salinas, although it spans from
Watsonville to King City. At least 2 fields were abandoned, and
others varied in loss from 20 percent to 60 percent. Many fields have
been fumigated and planted to strawberries for 2 seasons, only to
have the wilt reappear when lettuce was planted. The wilt has great
diversity in the Salinas Valley, and thus far sources of it are known
to be Washington State, Denmark, and the Netherlands.

[Serious wilting diseases caused by _Verticillium dahliae_ and _V.
albo-atrum_ affect a wide range of crops and other plants. The fungi
are soil-borne and can persist in soils for many years. _V. dahliae_
wilt has emerged as a serious threat to lettuce production in
California. Symptoms include wilting and yellowing of the outer
leaves as well as brown streaks in the vascular tissue of crown and
root. Two races of the pathogen have been identified in lettuce, and
weed reservoirs as well as infected seeds have been found to be
potential sources of inoculum for this crop. Airborne spread is also
suspected. Resistant lettuce cultivars are being developed, but in
the meantime disease management includes crop rotation and fumigation
to reduce soil-borne inoculum.
