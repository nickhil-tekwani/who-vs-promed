[According to the report above, a total of 82 883 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 2 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (4 May 2020) report. The newly reported cases are in Shaanxi and both are imported cases. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases. A total of 1678 imported cases have been identified.

As best as I can tell from the machine-translated report above, there were 20 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, there were 3 imported cases. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 903, and 88 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. While there had been locally transmitted cases in both Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, there have been no reported cases from Guangdong since 28 Apr 2020 and no reports of cases in Heilongjiang since 30 Apr 2020. In recent days the main concern are importations.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 2 cases and 1 death compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (4 to 5 May 2020) when there were 3 newly confirmed cases and 2 deaths. A total of 10 806 confirmed cases and 255 deaths were reported today (5 May 2020), up from 10 804 cases and 254 deaths yesterday (4 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 34 consecutive days and below 50 for 27 consecutive days. None of the 17 regions reported newly confirmed cases; all of the 2 newly confirmed cases were imported cases, both in quarantine. This is now day 1 with no newly confirmed cases outside of quarantine, and day 2 of no locally transmitted cases. While it is too soon to conclude that transmission has been interrupted, the move to social distancing helped impact local transmission, so during the past 2 weeks, 73.6% of newly confirmed cases were importation related (as per the pie chart in the 5 May 2020 English language report). As they move to the next phase "Distancing in Daily Life," all eyes will be on the country to see if they can maintain the level of control they have had.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 213 013 cases, including 29 315 deaths, up from 211 938 cases and 29 079 deaths reported on 4 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 4 and 5 May 2020 was 1075 newly confirmed cases, compared with 1221 newly confirmed cases between 3 and 4 May 2020. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline.

Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 72.7% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 46.5% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Piedmont are the only provinces reporting 100 or more newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 2 provinces reported 0 newly confirmed cases, 6 additional provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases, and another 8 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 38 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 36 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through, 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 99 970 total cases, 6340 deaths
Date: Tue 5 May 2020 8:15 PM SGT
Source: The Straits Times, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]
https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-says-coronavirus-infections-near-100000


Iran on Tuesday [5 May 2020] announced that confirmed coronavirus infections had reached almost 100 000 in the country as fresh cases picked up again after a brief drop in recent days. "The number of confirmed infections with this disease is now close to 100 000," health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said in televised remarks. "We lost 63 of our countrymen in the past 24 hours, reaching a total of 6340 deaths from COVID-19 to date," he added. Jahanpour said that another 1323 people tested positive for the virus during the same period, bringing the overall number to 99 970.

Two-thirds of the fresh cases were "those sampled as outpatients" or family members of those infected, Jahanpour said. On Saturday [2 May 2020], Iran's new daily infections hit their lowest since [10 Mar 2020] but they have picked up again since then. According to Jahanpour, 80 475 of those hospitalised with the disease since Iran reported its 1st cases in mid-February [2020] have been discharged, while 2685 are in critical condition.

Doubts have been cast over Iran's coronavirus figures by experts and officials both at home and abroad.

Iran has reopened mosques in parts of the country deemed at low risk from the virus after allowing a phased reopening of businesses since [ 11 April 2020].

The Islamic republic is using a colour-coded system of "white" for low-risk parts of the country, "yellow" for medium-risk zones, and "red" for high-risk areas. Hamshahri reported that southern provinces such as Sistan and Baluchistan, Hormozgan, Fars, and Bushehr had the most white areas. Other provinces are mostly still yellow, while Qom, the virus' epicentre in Iran, was red with a "rising trend" of new infections.

Ministry officials have warned that an area being "white" does not mean "the situation is normal" there and that the condition can reverse at any time.

The number of deaths has increased from 6277 to 6340, an increase of 63 deaths in the 24-hour period (as of 5 May 2020). In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran now ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Spain, Italy, UK, France, Germany, Russia, Turkey, and Brazil. As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening. The past 3 days have seen slight increases in newly confirmed cases from 802 to 976 to 1223 and now to 1323. See section [7] below discussing the noted resurgences.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 237 633, including 72 271 deaths, an increase from 1 212 835 cases and 69 921 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 330 139 (26.7%) cumulative case reports and 2765 (11.2%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 171 723 as of 1:00 PM on 5 May 2020, including 13 724 confirmed deaths and an additional 5383 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in California (2536 -- 10.2%), New Jersey (2360 -- 9.5%), Illinois (2122 - 8.6% of total), Texas (1211 -- 4.9%), Massachusetts (1184 -- 4.8%), Pennsylvania (985 -- 4.0%), Virginia (764 -- 3.1%), and Maryland (709 -- 2.9%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Texas, and Connecticut.

Repeating from previous days, more sobering, if you treat each state as a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1 followed by Spain, Italy, UK, France, Germany, Russia, New Jersey, Turkey, and Brazil as number 10. Number 11 would be Iran, 12 China, 13 Massachusetts, 14 Illinois, 15 Canada, 16 California, 17 Pennsylvania, 18 Peru, 19 Belgium, and 20 India. 6 US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL). Even more sobering is that New York City would be between the UK and France (it would be number 5).

The US military has confirmed 7526 cumulative cases, with 92 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 9771 cumulative cases and 144 new cases today (5 May 2020). There have been 2425 cases reported from federal prisons (85 new cases in the past 24 hours) and 2474 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (101 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 1924 cases (81 new cases in the past 24 hours).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations and not antibody based, effective 25 Apr 2020. The antibody confirmed cases are shown in the graph accompanying Table 1, but tabular form showing data by province is not available on the daily update website. That being said, Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 867 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the 24 hour period from 3 to 4 May 2020, bringing the PCR confirmed cumulative total to 219 329 [250 561] as compared with 218 011 PCR [248 301] confirmed cases on 3 May 2020 an increase from 356 change reported in yesterday's update (situation report 95 -- 4 May 2020), quite possibly due to post-weekend reporting artefact.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 47.24, a continual slow decrease over the past 26 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 47.24 today (5 May 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 219 329 [250 561] cases, approximately 119 609 (54.5%) [47.7%] -- an additional 720 cases have been hospitalized and 11 031 (5.0%) [4.4%] an additional 37 cases were admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data). 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to the ICU.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7304317,43. Catalonia, Castile and Leon, and La Rioja are still the most affected communities by population-based rates, even though their rates are dropping. Castile and Leon and neighboring La Rioja are located in the northern part of the country and Catalonia in the north east. - Mod.MPP]

[7] Iran: resurgence
Date: Tue 5 May 2020
Source: Al Monitor [edited]

A report released by Iran's Health Ministry says 15 out of the country's 31 provinces are experiencing a resurgence of the novel coronavirus pandemic, despite a flattened curve after more than 2 months of containment efforts. While the capital Tehran appeared to have begun a downward trend in cases, several popular tourism areas including Isfahan, Gilan and the pilgrimage city of Qom -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- are now facing another wave of infection.

The impoverished southern province of Hormozgan is also on the list. The growth in infections despite 36 degree Celsius temperatures (97 F) in Hormozgan once again dashed hopes that hot weather may subdue the virus. One Health Ministry test conducted in a Hormozgan seafood market alone identified over 100 cases of people who exhibited no obvious symptoms.

The resurgence has also slammed the oil-rich province of Khuzestan in the past 10 days, with governor Gholam-Reza Shariati blaming the situation on the "public's disregard" for social distancing measures. If the current trend holds, Shariati warned, the earlier restrictions will have to return in force.

Starting [11 Apr 2020], Iran introduced a phased relaxation of the strict containment measures, lifting travel bans and restoring much of the economy to pre-pandemic activity. The government also allowed religious gatherings to resume in mosques across 132 cities and Friday prayers in many more after mounting pressure from the conservative clergy, who argue that a continued closure on religious sites will deal an irreparable spiritual blow to the Iranian theocracy.

Nonetheless, deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi warned that even in those areas, designated as "COVID-19 white spots," the resumption of collective religious activities by no means indicates "the situation is back to normal", and that social distancing will have to drag on until the world finds a vaccine.

Questions surrounding how much longer those precautions will have to be observed remain an open debate in Iran, with some officials accused of serving as inappropriate examples by ignoring the measures before the public eye. Video from a [5 May 2020] parliament meeting broadcast on state TV showed speaker Ali Larijani -- a coronavirus survivor himself -- urging lawmakers to maintain the recommended distance from each other.

For several days in a row, Iran had registered double-digit mortality figures. But as of [5 May 2020], the total number of infected neared 100 000. Iran's flattened curve remains fragile, some experts have noted with serious concern about the return to normal. Iranian health officials sounded the alarm last month [April 2020] that it is only a matter of time before 2nd and 3rd waves of infection, a situation that would reimpose massive burdens on Iran's already overstretched 1st responders and sanctions-hit medical infrastructure.

"According to reports, there is a possibility of a peak of corona prevalence in 15 provinces, which is on the rise, and in contrast, 9 provinces have had a declining trend against coronavirus.

"According to the Borno News Agency, and according to a report published by the Ministry of Health, the analysis of the trend of changes in the incidence of deaths and deaths reported on a daily basis has been used to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 disease in different provinces of the country. To calculate the trend of changes in death and morbidity in the last 5 days, first, the average 3-day number of reports of infection and death each day is calculated by averaging the data of the same day, the day before and the day after. Then, the increase rate was calculated each day compared to the previous day. Finally, the change in the incidence and death rate was calculated by averaging the numbers obtained for the last days. For better analysis, the indicators of the last 5 days were analyzed.

"The report of the Ministry of Health acknowledges that the following items have been considered for a possible analysis of the epidemic curve:

"According to the epidemiology committee of the Ministry of Health published in the information base of the Ministry of Health, the upward trend or peak of courier in 15 provinces (Qom, Lorestan, Ilam, Gilan, Golestan, Khorasan Razavi, Kohgiluyeh, and Boyer-Ahmad, Khuzestan, Hormozgan, Kerman, Yazd, Isfahan, Zanjan, Chaharmahal, Bakhtiari, and Kermanshah) are observed. Kurdistan Province is thought to have reached a stage of stability.

"9 provinces in the downward trend of coronavirus: Azerbaijan, Tehran, Alborz, Mazandaran, North Khorasan, Fars, Hamedan, Sistan, and Balochistan) show a downward trend.

"Probably 4 provinces (Qazvin, South Khorasan, West Azerbaijan, and Bushehr) have recently experienced an epidemic peak.

"The Ministry of Health also announced that data incompatibilities in the 2 provinces of Ardabil and Semnan would not allow an accurate analysis of the epidemic situation. Of course, one province can experience several curved peaks." (original available at https://tinyurl.com/yddr4uqf)

Over the past few days there has been a slow but steady increase in daily reports of newly confirmed infections noted supporting the Ministry observation that cases are increasing. - Mod.MPP]
