[In 2008, one outbreak of HPAI subtype H5N1 was reported in the village of Donmai, Xayabury province (currently spelled Xaignabouri province). The outbreak was resolved in December 2008. See report and map at: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000007639_20081229_121956.pdf.

In January 2009 and April 2010, 2 events of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N1 were reported by Laos. These were located in the provinces of Phongsaly (1 outbreak) and Vientiane Capital (1 outbreak). See report and map: Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Phongsaly, January 2009 http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000007971_20090404_162709.pdf and Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Vientiane Capital, April 2010 http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000009378_20100614_175600.pdf.

According to the last 6-monthly report (July-December 2012) sent to the OIE by Laos, HPAI had been absent in the country since May 2010. It is noteworthy that if HPAI is one of the trans-boundary animal diseases having a significant impact in both trade and human health, it is not a notifiable disease in the country and no surveillance is being done as a basic control measure.

Based on the information Laos provided the OIE, it begs the question of whether or not the disease has been present prior to this reported event in this and other provinces.
