Issuance of guidance on management of asymptomatic patients who received epidural or paraspinal injections with contaminated steroid products
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As part of its ongoing investigation of the multistate outbreak of fungal infections, the CDC continues to assess and revise interim guidance to clinicians involved in the management of patients who received injections with contaminated steroid products distributed by the New England Compounding Center (NECC). Since early in the outbreak, CDC has recommended against antifungal prophylactic or presumptive treatment of exposed asymptomatic patients in the absence of diagnostic testing with results indicating meningitis. This recommendation remains unchanged.

Nevertheless, CDC recognizes the need to assist clinicians in managing asymptomatic patients who received epidural or paraspinal injections with contaminated steroid products. CDC is releasing updated interim guidance to clinicians based on new data that has become available during this investigation.

CDC analysis suggests that the period of greatest risk for development of fungal meningitis among patients who received epidural or paraspinal injections with contaminated products is during the 1st 6 weeks (42 days) after injection; therefore, additional monitoring of these patients should be considered. Accordingly, CDC provides guidance for asymptomatic patients who received epidural or paraspinal injections with contaminated steroid product within the last 6 weeks (42 days), and those who received such products longer than 6 weeks (42 days) ago. For specific details about the updated guidance, see "Guidance on management of asymptomatic patients who received epidural or paraspinal injections with contaminated steroid products" [see specific guidelines below. - Mod.LL]

As stated above, CDC does not recommend initiation of antifungal treatment in the absence of diagnostic test results indicating fungal meningitis in exposed patients who are asymptomatic. Currently available data do not suggest an added benefit to this approach in comparison to the strategies outlined in the updated guidance, and patients may experience serious adverse drug events associated with treatment.

The guidance and estimates are based on data currently available to CDC. Additional data that are gathered from existing and newly reported cases of infection, when combined with previous data, may alter the guidance and estimates. Clinicians and others with patients under their care who use the guidance and estimates should check CDC's website for the most up-to-date information, since it is subject to change periodically.

[3] CDC: Guidance for asymptomatic patients who received their last epidural or paraspinal injection with contaminated steroid product
Date: Tue 23 Oct 2012
Source: CDC [edited]
http://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/clinicians/guidance_asymptomatic_persons.html


Guidance for asymptomatic patients who received their last epidural or paraspinal injection with contaminated steroid product within the last 6 weeks (42 days)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Option 1
--------
This option is consistent with the existing recommended strategy.

Continue to closely monitor for development of symptoms, with a low threshold for performing lumbar puncture should the patient become symptomatic. When diagnostic lumbar punctures are performed, they should be done through a site other than the site used for epidural injection when possible.

Option 2
--------
This option, which is estimated to reduce the maximal risk of stroke or death from approximately 0.4 percent to 0.3 percent in comparison to option 1, may also be considered.

Perform lumbar puncture, through a site other than the site used for epidural injection when possible. If the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination shows less than or equal to 5 white blood cells (WBC), the patient should continue to be followed very closely for onset of symptoms. If the patient remains asymptomatic, consider repeating weekly lumbar punctures until 6 weeks (42 days) have passed since the last epidural or paraspinal injection with contaminated steroid product, at which time the patient can be monitored closely for the development of symptoms, with a low threshold for performing lumbar puncture should the patient become symptomatic. Patients with greater than 5 WBCs in CSF should be treated for fungal meningitis according to current treatment guidance.

In making a management decision, clinicians should also consider the risk associated with lumbar puncture (such as, post-lumbar puncture headache, CSF leak, the theoretical risk that fungi could be transferred from the epidural space into the subarachnoid space of a patient who has received epidural or paraspinal injections with contaminated steroid products).

Guidance for asymptomatic patients who received their last epidural or paraspinal injection with contaminated steroid product greater than 6 weeks (42 days) ago
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Patients who received their last epidural or paraspinal injection with contaminated steroid product greater than 6 weeks (42 days) ago should continue to be closely monitored as previously recommended for development of symptoms, with a low threshold for performing lumbar puncture should the patient become symptomatic. When diagnostic lumbar punctures are performed, they should be done through a site other than the site used for epidural injection when possible.

At this time CDC does not recommend initiation of antifungal treatment in the absence of diagnostic testing with results indicating meningitis in exposed patients who are asymptomatic. Currently available data do not suggest an added benefit to this approach in comparison to the strategies outlined above, and many patients may experience serious adverse drug events associated with treatment.

Decisions on management of asymptomatic patients who received epidural or paraspinal injections with contaminated steroid products should be made by the patient and provider after a thorough consideration of the potential risks and benefits for that individual patient.

Background
----------
To further inform decisions regarding management of asymptomatic patients who have received epidural or paraspinal injections with contaminated steroid products, CDC has developed a decision analysis model to estimate the potential incremental risks and benefits of administering antifungal agents to asymptomatic persons compared with the currently recommended strategy. The decision analysis model uses data collected in the ongoing outbreak investigation, information from the medical literature regarding the toxicity of recommended antifungal medications, and opinion of clinical experts on fungal infection. The results of the decision analysis are preliminary and subject to change as new information becomes available.

The analysis suggests that the period of greatest risk for the development of fungal meningitis is during the first 6 weeks (42 days) after receiving an epidural or paraspinal injection with a contaminated steroid product. As of 22 Oct 2012, at least 26 days should have passed since any patient received an injection with medication from these lots given that the medication was recalled on 26 Sep 2012. The estimated remaining risk of developing meningitis is likely to be no greater than 5 percent on the 26th day following their last epidural or paraspinal injection, and then decreases to a risk of no greater than 1 percent by 6 weeks (42 days) following injection. The majority of these patients will have risks of meningitis much lower than the estimated risks quoted above, and their risk will continue to decrease as more time elapses since their last injection.

The estimated remaining risk of stroke or death is likely to be no greater than 0.4 percent on the 26th day following their last epidural or paraspinal injection, and then decreases to a risk of no greater than 0.08 percent by 6 weeks (42 days) following injection. The majority of these patients will have risks of stroke or death much lower than the estimated risks quoted above, and their risk will continue to decrease as more time elapses since their last injection (see Figure [available at the source URL above. - Mod.LL]).

[4] CDC: Interim treatment guidance for osteoarticular infections associated with injection of contaminated steroid products
Date: Tue 23 Oct 2012
Source: CDC [edited]
http://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/clinicians/interim_guidance_osteoarticular_infections.html


Rationale
---------
This is interim guidance for treatment of adult patients with osteoarticular infections associated with intra-articular injections of contaminated steroid products from the New England Compounding Center [NECC]. Interim guidance may change as new information becomes available.

These recommendations are based upon growing evidence that _Exserohilum rostratum_ (a brown-black mold) is the predominant pathogen in this outbreak, and expert opinion and published literature indicating that voriconazole may be effective in treating infections due to brown-black molds as well as infections due to _Aspergillus_ species. Recommendations are also based on considerations related to the anatomic site of infection and pharmacokinetics of antifungal agents. CDC continues to consult with national experts about treatment options for fungal osteoarticular infections in patients associated with this outbreak.

Infectious diseases physician consultation
------------------------------------------
Consult an infectious diseases physician to assist with patient diagnosis, management, and follow up, which may be complex and prolonged.

Diagnostic considerations
-------------------------
Thorough diagnostic evaluation is essential, and should include collection of synovial fluid and/or synovial tissue prior to initiation of treatment. Samples should be sent or fungal culture, molecular testing, and histopathological examination, in addition to the standard tests for bacterial infection and crystal-induced disease.

Physicians should use their best judgment in regard to imaging the osteoarticular structure(s) that may be infected. For large joints, such as knees, if there is a consideration of adjacent osteomyelitis, then imaging should be performed. Imaging may be particularly important in the evaluation of joint spaces such as the sacroiliac joint, where osteomyelitis may be more common and from which obtaining a diagnostic specimen of synovial fluid may be more difficult. Similarly, for patients in whom complaints of back pain are worrisome for the development of discitis/vertebral osteomyelitis, imaging should be performed. In some of these cases, repeat imaging may be required as the progression of the infection may be slow and imaging findings suggestive or diagnostic of osteomyelitis may not be evident for 2 weeks or more following initial presentation.

Note that a negative fungal culture or negative fungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from a diagnostic specimen obtained from a joint space or bone does not rule out infection. Active fungal infection may be present even when these tests are negative.

Empiric antifungal therapy
--------------------------
Routine empiric antibacterial therapy should be used according to the judgment of the physician while awaiting results of diagnostic studies.

In clinically stable patients with peripheral joint infection, it may be reasonable to wait 48-72 hours before initiating empiric antifungal therapy, to allow time for identification of alternative diagnoses (such as, bacterial arthritis, crystal-induced arthritis, etc.). This decision should be made at the discretion of the provider.

When empiric antifungal therapy is initiated, the following regimen is suggested until the etiology of the patient's septic arthritis has been identified:
- For discitis, vertebral osteomyelitis, and epidural abscess give voriconazole at a dose of 6 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) every 12 hours. For osteoarticular infections that do not involve the spine, give voriconazole, beginning with a loading dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours for 2 doses, followed by 4 mg/kg every 12 hours.

Dose adjustments may be needed for certain patients, including (but not necessarily limited to): children (who often need a higher dose) and patients with hepatic impairment (who may need a lower dose). Dosing of voriconazole in obese patients should be discussed with an infectious diseases physician. Oral voriconazole should be taken at least one hour before or after a meal. Consult an infectious diseases physician and refer to the manufacturer's instructions.

A blood specimen for serum voriconazole trough level measurement should be collected on the 5th day of voriconazole treatment, and the dose of voriconazole should be adjusted based on this trough level, aiming for a trough level range of 2 to 5 micrograms per milliliter (mcg/mL). Serum voriconazole trough levels greater than 5 mcg/mL should be avoided because of the risk of neurotoxicity and other drug-related adverse events.

Regular monitoring of serum voriconazole trough levels once per week should occur for the initial 4-6 weeks of voriconazole treatment and when dose adjustments are made. Dose adjustments should be made as needed to maintain serum voriconazole trough levels within the range of 2 to 5 mcg/mL.

Patients with more severe osteoarticular infection, clinical instability, discitis, vertebral osteomyelitis, or epidural abscess should be started on voriconazole IV. If the provider wants to transition patients initially treated with IV voriconazole to oral voriconazole, this should be done only after a patient is clinically stable or improving, as long as no contraindications to oral therapy exist.

Patients with mild osteoarticular infection not involving the spine who are able to take oral voriconazole as prescribed and who are able to be monitored closely may be started on oral voriconazole at the provider's discretion. Patients on oral voriconazole should be treated with a loading dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours for 2 doses, followed by 4 mg/kg every 12 hours, with monitoring of serum voriconazole trough levels as above and dose adjustment as necessary. The target range for serum voriconazole trough levels (2 to 5 mcg/mL) is readily achievable using the oral form of the drug, but may require a slightly higher dose and may take longer to achieve if unforeseen problems with gastrointestinal intolerance or poor absorption are encountered.

Providers and patients should be aware of and monitor for potential adverse effects of voriconazole, including (but not limited to) hepatic toxicity and neurotoxicity. Liver function tests should be closely monitored. The occurrence of hallucinations may be an indication of neurotoxicity and elevated serum voriconazole levels, and should prompt collection of a blood specimen for serum voriconazole trough level measurement and voriconazole dose adjustment.

Providers should carefully consider and manage the potential for voriconazole drug interactions in all patients.

- A lipid formulation of amphotericin B at a dose of 5 mg/kg IV daily should be considered in addition to voriconazole in patients with severe osteoarticular infection and/or patients with clinical instability. Nephrotoxicity is a common complication of amphotericin B therapy, including therapy with lipid formulations of amphotericin B. Kidney function and electrolytes should be monitored closely in patients receiving any amphotericin B formulation. Administration of 1 liter of normal saline IV prior to amphotericin B infusion may be considered to minimize risk of nephrotoxicity. Providers and patients should also be aware of and monitor for other potential adverse effects of amphotericin B formulations.

- Alternate therapies to consider for patients who are unable to tolerate treatment with voriconazole include lipid formulations of amphotericin B, posaconazole, and itraconazole. Therapeutic drug monitoring should be performed for patients treated with posaconazole or itraconazole. Consultation with an infectious diseases physician should be sought regarding dosages and monitoring of these agents. Fluconazole should NOT be used.

Other treatment considerations
------------------------------
Arthroscopy with joint lavage and debridement should be considered in consultation with an orthopedic surgeon, or a neurosurgeon in the case of vertebral osteomyelitis.

Considerations regarding duration of treatment
----------------------------------------------
Adequate duration of antifungal treatment is unknown, and it is likely that patients will require prolonged therapy tailored by the clinical response to treatment. Individual patient management decisions, including choice of long-term antifungal treatment regimens, should be made in consultation with infectious diseases physicians experienced in the treatment of fungal infections. While adequate duration of therapy is unknown and will likely vary substantially depending upon individual patient circumstances, a minimum of 3 months of antifungal treatment should be considered. Treatment may need to continue for longer than 3 months in patients with more severe disease, bone infection, underlying immunosuppression, etc. Clinicians should be vigilant for potential relapse of infection after completion of therapy.

[5] NECC inspection results
Date: Tue 23 Oct 2012
Source: Massachusetts Department of Public Health [edited]
http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/quality/boards/necc/necc-preliminary-report-10-23-2012.pdf


Since 24 Sep 2012 a widespread outbreak of fungal meningitis has affected people in 17 states and caused 23 deaths at the time of this report. The outbreak originated from a medication compounded by New England Compounding Center (NECC), a facility licensed by the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy (Board). The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) has taken immediate action to protect public health and safety. In collaboration with investigators from the FDA, DPH investigators have worked to identify the root causes of these events. While the complete scope and severity of this outbreak will not be fully understood for many weeks, to ensure the utmost transparency, DPH is releasing these preliminary findings from its ongoing investigation of NECC. This report constitutes early findings that may be subject to revision as the investigation unfolds.

Medication compounding involves the practice of taking commercially available products and modifying them to meet the needs of an individual patient pursuant to a prescription from a licensed provider. Nearly all retail pharmacies in Massachusetts perform compounding, however only 25 compounding pharmacies meet the standards necessary to produce sterile injectable products. By terms of their license with the Board, every Massachusetts pharmacy must comply with Massachusetts laws and regulations, including compliance with the United States Pharmacopeia Standards.

Compounding pharmacies may only perform compounding upon receipt of a patient-specific prescription. These requirements and restrictions are consistent with the rules in place in other states.

Upon beginning the joint on-site investigation of NECC early in this outbreak, DPH, and FDA investigators identified serious deficiencies and significant violations of pharmacy law and regulations that clearly placed the public's health and safety at risk.

The NECC on-site investigation process consisted of DPH investigators obtaining documentary evidence (including photographs), reviewing and obtaining copies of Standard Operating Procedures, observational findings, reviewing and obtaining copies of all policies and procedures, reviewing batch records and interviewing NECC staff. The FDA conducted product testing and investigators took environmental samples of various areas of the facility to test for contaminants.

DPH investigators principally communicated with 3 NECC staff members during the on-site investigation. along with FDA investigators.

After 26 Sep 2012, the majority of NECC employees were no longer on site. As has publicly been documented, NECC terminated many of their staff. The continuing investigation will include interviews of NECC employees.

Selected preliminary findings
-----------------------------
During the facility inspections, investigators documented serious health and safety deficiencies related to the practice of pharmacy:
- NECC distributed large batches of compounded sterile products directly to facilities apparently for general use rather than requiring a prescription for an individual patient.
- Records show that NECC had lists of potential patient names but did not have patient-specific prescriptions from an authorized practitioner when compounding and dispensing medication, as required by state law.
- Manufacturing and distributing sterile products in bulk was not allowed under the terms of its state pharmacy license. If NECC was appropriately licensed as a manufacturer with the FDA the company would have been subject to additional levels of scrutiny.
- NECC did not conduct patient-specific medication history and drug utilization reviews as required by regulations.
- NECC distributed 2 of the recalled lots of methylprednisolone acetate (PF) 80 mg/mL prior to receiving results of sterility testing.
- While NECC's records show the sterility tests found no contamination, the adequacy of NECC's sterility testing methods are currently under examination.
- Final sterilization of product did not follow proper standards for autoclaving (sterilization through high pressure steam) pursuant to United States Pharmacopeia Standard 797 (USP 797) and NECC's own Standard Operating Procedures.
- Examination of NECC records indicated a systemic failure to keep products in the autoclave for the required minimum 20-minute sterilization period necessary to ensure product sterility.
- NECC did not conduct proper validation of autoclaves pursuant to USP 797 to test their autoclaves to ensure proper function.
- Visible black particulate matter was seen in several recalled sealed vials of methylprednisolone acetate from Lot 08102012@51.
- Powder hoods, intended to protect pharmacists from inhaling substances during medication preparation, within the sterile compounding area were not thoroughly cleaned pursuant to USP 797.
- Residual powder was visually observed within the hood during inspection. This contamination may subsequently lead to contamination of compounded medications.
- Condition of "Tacky" mats, which are used to trap dirt, dust, and other potential contaminants from shoes prior to clean room entry, violated the USP 797 as Mats were visibly soiled with assorted debris.
- A leaking boiler adjacent to the requisite clean room created an environment susceptible to contaminant growth with a pool of water visually observed around the boiler and adjacent walls, creating an unsanitary condition; the culture results of this potential contaminant are still pending.
