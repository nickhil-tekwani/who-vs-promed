The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) and
the Chaffee County Public Health Department are investigating a
confirmed case of tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) in a volunteer who
worked at a youth camp in central Colorado during July-August 2011.
Presenting symptoms included fever, sweats, weakness, confusion,
headache, muscle and joint pain, and nausea. This patient remains
hospitalized following re-admission for relapse of symptoms despite
appropriate treatment of the initial TBRF episode. Ongoing
epidemiologic investigation indicates that the volunteer acquired TBRF
while working at the camp and environmental assessment of the cabin
occupied by the ill volunteer revealed evidence of significant rodent
infestation compatible with TBRF exposure.

Camp participants originate from multiple states and internationally
with approximately 625 campers and volunteers attending weekly during
the summer. Because attendees are housed in group settings in
comparable cabin environments, similar exposures for all camp
participants are possible.

Patients presenting with initial or recurrent fever, generalized body
aches, headaches, chills, and sweats that have recently slept in a
rustic cabin in mountainous areas of Colorado and/or stayed at a youth
camp in central Colorado should be evaluated for TBRF through routine
blood smear examination. Smear evaluation while febrile and prior to
antibiotic therapy is most likely to reveal spirochetes.

Clinicians or health officials who identify related TBRF cases are
asked to relay reports to Colorado Department of Public Health &
Environment at (303) 692-2700.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Lawaczeck for this report. Since campers and
volunteers originated from other states and nations, it is important
to consider this infection outside of the endemic areas of the
American west.

Relapsing fever is caused by a spirochete in the _Borrelia_ genus. The
_Ornithodoros_ tick vector can be seen at
http://www.lyme.org/img/gallery/o_hermsi.jpg. This "soft tick" feeds
over a much shorter time than the typical "hard ticks" such as those
that spread Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease and,
therefore, are less likely to be discovered while feeding.

The diagnosis of relapsing fever can be readily made during febrile
periods by a Wright's stain of the peripheral blood. Unlike other
spirochetes, this organism readily picks up the Wright stain. The
typical peripheral blood smear can be seen at
http://www.ccjm.org/content/75/7/521.full#F3.

The relapses appear to be caused by changes in the outer protein
antigens of the organism. For additional reading on the manifestations
of the tick-borne form, references 1 and 2 below are useful.

Louse-borne relapsing fever, seen primarily in Africa, has a less
benign course than its tick-borne cousin.
