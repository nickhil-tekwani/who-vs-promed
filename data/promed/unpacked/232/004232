Suggested to consider, for differential diagnosis, also swollen head syndrome (SHS). SHS affects predominantly males and causes, in difference with infectious coryza, sudden deaths.

[We are grateful to Dr Meroz for reminding of SHS, which seems as a plausible candidate within the diagnostic efforts of the cases described in fighting cocks (Cotabato City, Philippines). The report (20200215.6991197) said that "the animals all died inside their cages and showed symptoms like swollen head, blindness, and severe flu" as well as "colds and fever, becoming weak."

"Swollen head syndrome (SHS) is a complicated infection in broilers and broiler breeders, where the primary aetiological agent is an avian pneumovirus (APV) and the secondary -- usually _E. coli_; it is characterized by respiratory and nervous signs. In broiler chickens, SHS is generally seen after the 4th week of life. The 1st clinical signs are sneezing, coughing, rales, and conjunctivitis. A profuse tear secretion, reddened conjunctivas and a characteristic oblong almond-like shape of eyes are observed. The inflammatory exudate is initially transparent, but afterwards becomes opaque."
