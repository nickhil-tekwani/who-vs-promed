Persistent hot weather and high humidity of over 89 percent in the
central region has helped rice leaf folders, brown backed rice plant
hoppers, brown spot and other diseases to thrive, damaging thousands
of hectares of paddies.

Over the last 10 days in Thua Thien-Hue Province, rice farms reported
leaf folders had invaded crops with a density of 2-5 worms a square meter.

Rice blast disease attacked 3-5 percent of rice in the province; the
figure was up to 15 percent in some districts including Phong Dien,
Quang Dien and Phu Vang.

Brown rice hoppers have caused widespread damage to rice fields in
Binh Dinh province since early February 2010. It is facing an
emergency situation with rice fields in the whole province being
attacked by the hoppers.

In only 3 weeks, the insects had damaged 1533 hectares of rice plants
in several parts of the province. About 208 hectares have suffered
particularly serious damage. Localities totally taken over by the
hoppers are Phu Cat (825 hectares), Tay Son (193.5 hectares), Hoai An
(156.5 hectares), and Hoai Nhon (132.5 hectares).

The province is carrying out large scale disinfection, which has so
far covered 1000 hectares. However, local scientists are worried that
baby hoppers can wreak even more damage than the older ones. The
anticipated attack by the young hoppers will take place in March 2010
and is expected to affect young and old rice plants.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe grisea_. It is one
of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide with potential
yield losses of more than 50 percent. Symptoms include lesions on all
parts of the shoot, stem rot, and panicle blight. The disease is
spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect
activity), water, and wind. Disease management may include fungicides
and cultural practices, but relies mainly on resistant varieties.
However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence
of new strains with increased virulence. Rice blast was reported in
the country earlier in 2010 in the Mekong Delta region (ProMED-mail
post 20100129.0310).

Brown spot disease of rice is caused by the fungus _Cochliobolus
miyabeanus_. Symptoms include brownish spots on leaves and glumes, as
well as blight on seedlings grown from infected seeds with a
mortality rate of up to 60 percent. The disease also affects quality,
weight and number of grains per panicle with a yield reduction of up
to 45 percent. The disease is favoured by a poor nutritional state of
the host. Spores are carried on seed and other plant parts. Brown
spot is managed by fungicide sprays, seed treatments (hot water,
fungicides), but mainly by use of resistant crop varieties.

The brown rice planthopper (_Nilaparvata lugens_) is one of the worst
pests of rice in the Australasian and Pacific Island region. It is
also the vector of _Rice grassy stunt virus_ (RGSV) and _Rice ragged
stunt virus_ (RRSV). Crop losses of up to 100 percent due to some
virus diseases have been reported. High hopper numbers pose a high
risk of associated virus outbreaks as reported in previous years from
Viet Nam. Disease management of rice viruses generally includes
cultural techniques (for example planting time, reduction of
inoculum), vector control, and use of crop cultivars resistant to the
virus, the vector, or both.
