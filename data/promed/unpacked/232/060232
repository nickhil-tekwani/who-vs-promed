Though considered primarily a summertime nuisance, mosquitoes are still active in Iowa. The Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) reminds Iowans that mosquito-related diseases continue to be a concern as fall approaches, and remain a threat until the 1st frost. Precautions to reduce the risk of exposure to these diseases should still be taken.

To date, IDPH has received confirmation of one case of Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) [infection]. This virus is relatively rare (only a few cases are reported to the CDC each year since national reporting began in 2004); however, under-reporting and under-diagnosis are likely since diagnostic testing for JCV is not widely available. JCV [can cause] a brain infection caused [transmitted] by mosquitoes carrying the virus. The individual with JCV [infection] is recovering. "It's important for Iowans to still take measures to protect themselves and their loved ones from mosquito-borne diseases like JCV," said IDPH Public Health Veterinarian, Dr. Ann Garvey. "It remains important to eliminate mosquito breeding areas and use insect repellant when outdoors." Intermittent days of heavy downpours followed by mild weather may mean there is standing water around your home, where mosquitoes breed:
- Empty water from buckets, cans, pool covers, kiddie pools, pet water dishes and anywhere else water collects.
- Change water in bird baths every 3 to 4 days.

It's also important to repair holes or gaps in screen windows and doors to prevent mosquitoes from getting indoors.

Continue to take precautions against mosquito bites when spending time outdoors:
- Use insect repellent with DEET, picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon eucalyptus. Always read the repellent label and consult a health care provider if you have questions when using these types of products for children. For example, DEET should not be used on infants less than 2 months old and oil of lemon eucalyptus should not be used on children under 3 years old.
- Avoid outdoor activities at dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active.
- Wear long-sleeved shirts, pants, shoes, and socks whenever possible outdoors.

[The occurrence of Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) in Iowa is not surprising. JCV was 1st isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado, in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal [northern] _Aedes_ and _Ochlerotatus_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup Orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit the virus. White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_ are the principal amplification hosts.

As Drs. Charles Calisher and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED-mail archive no. 20040807.2171, JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an etiological agent of human disease, and provided the following references:

Jamestown Canyon (JCV) and La Crosse viruses (LACV) co-circulate in the same forests in some areas, but are transmitted by different vector mosquitoes. However, _Aedes albopictus_ can become infected by and transmit both viruses. Laboratory experiments have shown that when this mosquito is dually infected with LACV and JCV, the viruses can reassort their 3 RNA strands, with 6 novel reassorted viruses resulting. As _Ae. albopictus_ extends its geographic range to the north, it may eventually become established in areas where both viruses are present, with the resulting risk of dual infections in these mosquitoes.
