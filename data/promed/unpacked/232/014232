Last July [2021], the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of the Balearic Islands officially confirmed the presence of bluetongue serotype 4 on the island of Mallorca, after which the Government decided to start a vaccination campaign against the disease, which started on 12 Jul 2021.

Since the 1st outbreak of bluetongue [BT] was detected, outbreaks have been reported in different areas of the island of Mallorca. However, the last 2 outbreaks have been located, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA), on the island of Ibiza .

This presents the detection of the bluetongue for the first time in Ibiza since the disease returned to the archipelago in 2021.

The 2 outbreaks detected on the island of Ibiza occurred in the municipalities of Sant Joan de Labritja and Sant Antoni de Portmany, in 2 sheep farms, affecting a total of 7 animals .

Regarding the bluetongue vaccination campaign, which began last July [2021], the Balearic government estimates that before the end of the year [2021], more than 200 000 sheep and 16 000 cows (breeding animals) will have been vaccinated against the disease. Thus, the campaign is nearing completion. In fact, at the end of September [2021] they reported that more than 80% of the islands' cattle had already been vaccinated.

The Balearic authorities have already explained that, in parallel with the vaccination, they are closely monitoring all the notices of suspected cases. Monitoring of symptoms is also being applied in slaughterhouses.

[For a map presenting continental Spain and the Balearic islands of Ibiza and Mallorca, as well as North Africa's shores (Algeria), see https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm. The African continent is considered to be the source of windborne, BTV-infected culicoides introducing the virus to southern Spain (Andalusia, Extremadura; see item 2) and to the Balearic islands.

A confirmation of the serotype involved (most likely, BTV-4) will be helpful. Currently, BTV-4 is known to be circulating also in the Maghreb and in Sardinia, seriously affecting susceptible sheep breeds.

The distance between Ibiza/Mallorca and Algeria's shore is about 260 and 280 km., respectively. - Mod.AS]

[2] Spain, Extremadura, cattle, sheep

The return of bluetongue to Spain's Extremadura province has voided Spain's hope to declare this territory as having BT-free status, allowing exports. Six new outbreaks have been reported during the last 10 days [as of 9 Oct 2021]. The 1st case was detected on 29 Sep 2021 in Jerez de los Caballeros and this has been joined later by another 5 cases in Montemolín, Burguillos del Cerro, Los Santos de Maimona, Cheles and Valencia del Mombuey. The 1st 2 cases were located in cattle and sheep farms with 137 and 1200 sensitive animals, respectively, according to the specialized portal Animal's Health.

The reactivation of the disease implies the new implementation of the action measures established by the national regulations, "which are aimed at the epidemiological investigation of the disease in sentinel farms and suspicious farms and those related to the vaccination of bluetongue", as indicated by the Department of Agriculture. The measures affect bovine and ovine species, which are the ones that develop the disease [see comment].

"It is a disease that has come to stay. As soon as the vaccination stops and the herd immunity expires, while offspring is not protected by maternal immunity, the disease will return", says Antonio Trancoso, a veterinarian in the Llerena area. The main cause is that the [culicoides midges] which act as a vector, come from Africa. In earlier decades, this could occur only in the hottest months in Spain, but now the vector has become endemic. "The option would be not to stop vaccinating," reasons the vet.

The outbreak of the disease was almost expected because new cases had been located in Portugal and in neighboring provinces of Andalusia such as Huelva. In fact, the Ministry of Health had already raised the risk in the Jerez de los Caballeros region, which since 13 Sep 2021 was included among those considered (under) mandatory vaccination against the serotype [BTV-4] that has ended up being detected.

As part of the monitoring of the bluetongue [BT] situation and in view of the climatic factors that our country has witnessed, such as high temperatures and high humidity suitable for the reproduction of insects, especially vectors of diseases such as BT disease in sheep and cattle, the Ministry of Agriculture, based on reports issued by regional veterinary services and the results of the laboratory analyses carried out at the Veterinary Research Institute in Tunis, reports that 33 BT outbreaks have been recorded in cattle and sheep in some governorates to date [12 Oct 2021].

The health situation is considered stable in our country compared to the previous year [2020] (160 outbreaks), but it requires caution and close follow-up.

The Ministry of Agriculture states that BT disease isn't a zoonotic disease. It has been an endemic disease in our country since 1999 and is present in most countries north and south of the Mediterranean Basin and in African countries. This disease is transmitted to animals through biting insects (_Culicoides_) that breed in the presence of certain climatic factors such as humidity and high temperatures.

The head of the regional veterinary services of El Kef governorate, Hussein Al Razayqi, announced today [13 Oct 2021], in a statement to [Tunis Afrique Presse] that cases of bluetongue disease have been recorded among herds of livestock in the region.

Al Razayqi added that 5 foci of BT disease were discovered in the region, and he called on livestock breeders of cows and sheep to be vigilant and to adopt measures that prevent the breeding of insects, such as eliminating stagnant water and wet places that help the emergence of insects and their transmission to animals.

The head of the regional veterinary services of Jendouba governorate, veterinarian Ridha Ben Omran, confirmed the registration of 10 outbreaks of bluetongue disease following the reception of laboratory tests of samples from cattle and sheep that proved the presence of serotype 4 of this disease within 3 communes: Oued Melliz, Ain Draham, and Balta Bou Aoune.

He added that the veterinary services had raised additional samples from 5 other suspected outbreaks and that this disease caused the death of only 6 sheep in the region.

[Dr Mahmoud Orabi is gratefully acknowledged for his submissions.

The following information, addressing BTV and its vectors in Tunisia, is extracted/edited from a 2017 paper [Ref 1].

"Since 1999, BTV outbreaks have occurred in Tunisia, caused by 4 serotypes, BTV2, BTV1, BTV4 and BTV3, respectively during the years 2000, 2006, 2009, and 2016. Epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD, similarly a culicoides-borne orbivirus, affecting cattle) was detected for the 1st time in Tunisia and in other Northern African countries in 2006. These incursions have caused considerable economic losses. Our study had the goal to describe diversity, distribution, and seasonal dynamics of Culicoides. A total of 11 582 Culicoides specimens were collected from 336 light traps, comprising 25 species, of which 7 were identified for the 1st time in Tunisia, increasing to 35 the total number of Culicoides species now reported in this country. Both BTV1 and BTV4 were detected in _C. imicola_".

The above study (see fig. 5) found that the population dynamics of _C. imicola_ shows a peak in the months of August and October. The vector's activity season is traditionally considered to span between June to November. - Mods.AS, SF]
