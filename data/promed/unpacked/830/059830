State health investigators plan to trap rodents in a rural area south
of Santa Fe today [11 Jun 2007], in hopes of discovering how a
50-year-old woman got plague. They will also knock on doors to warn
residents and distribute brochures explaining how to avoid
contracting the severe infection, which is commonly spread to humans
from fleas that have feasted on infected rodents.
The woman has recovered after being hospitalized and already has been
spreading the word in her neighborhood, according to the New Mexico
Department of Health. The woman had septicemic plague, a blood
infection that can cause death. Symptoms can include fever, vomiting,
diarrhea, abdominal pain, low blood pressure, blood-clotting
problems, and organ failure.
Dr. Paul Ettestad, a public health veterinarian for the Health
Department, said it's not a good sign that the state has confirmed 4
cases of plague since April [2007]. "It could be a significant year
for a lot of plague activity," he said.
Prairie dogs and rock squirrels, common carriers of the plague, may
have swelled in number over the past couple of years because of
wetter than usual seasons, Ettestad said. Combine a lot of rodents
with a cool, wet spring, in which fleas multiply, and you have got a
mixture that could produce more plague cases in humans in 2007, he
said.
Recent cases seem to have other factors in common: plague-infected
rodents scurrying near but not inside the house, cats or dogs that
like to hunt rodents, cats or dogs that have not been treated for
fleas, and cats or dogs that flop on beds or couches inside the
house. Ettestad admits it is hard to prove that this is exactly how
the fleas got from the rodents to the humans, but he thinks it is
plausible.
"There are ways to protect you and your pets from plague: Prevent
your pets from roaming and hunting rodents, use a flea control
product on all your pets, and do not allow them to sleep in bed with
you," Ettestad said.
Last year [2006], 8 people in New Mexico had confirmed cases of
plague, and 2 of them died. According to the Health Department,
people who are promptly treated with the proper kind of antibiotics
are much less likely to die.
The cases in New Mexico in 2007:
The 1st case occurred in late April in a San Juan County man who recovered.
The 2nd was reported 5 Jun 2007 in a Torrance County woman who
remains hospitalized.
The 3rd was a 3-year-old Bernalillo County boy who was reported dead
on 7 Jun 2007.
The most recent is a 50-year-old woman who has recovered after hospitalization.

[As the posting states, following preventive strategies, early
recognition, and treatment of presumptive cases of plague are the
most important modalities in decreasing morbidity and mortality of
_Yersinia pestis_ infection.
