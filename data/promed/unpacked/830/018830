Black leg and black rot, plant diseases that Washington agricultural officials have long been on-guard for to protect the vegetable and oil seed industries, appeared this month in Western Washington in separate incidents. Seeds from an organic radish farm tested positive for black leg, black rot appeared on leaves of a brassica crop.

It's unknown how either disease was introduced, Washington State University's Lindsey du Toit said. Growers in both places reported the pathogens, helping efforts to contain them, she said. "Both have the same repercussions for the seed industry. I was pleased to see there wasn't an attempt to cover it up."

To guard against both, the [Washington] agriculture department requires crucifer seeds to be tested and treated. [A] black leg outbreak in the 1970s devastated Western Washington's vegetable seed industry. Black rot, according to the American Phytopathological Society, "must be considered the most important disease worldwide of vegetable brassicas."

[Blackleg
----------
Blackleg (also called phoma stem canker or leaf spot) is the most serious disease of crops in the Brassicaceae family with a possible yield loss of 50 per cent or more. Severe disease is caused by the fungus _Phaeosphaeria sowerbyi_ (previously _Leptosphaeria maculans_), while _Plenodomus biglobosus_ (previously _L. biglobosa_) has been reported in association with milder symptoms. The disease affects oilseed rape, various cabbages, turnip, radish, as well as brassicaceous weeds which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Depending on the host, symptoms may include lesions on leaves, stems and seed pods, with stem cankers leading to premature ripening or collapse of the plant. Root infections have also been reported (ProMED-mail post 20010819.1959). Symptomless infections may occur.

The fungi are seed borne and also spread by wind, splash dispersal, mechanical means (for example on contaminated equipment) and infected plant litter. They may overwinter in crop residues, which are therefore often sprayed with fungicides. However, this does not eliminate the risk from remaining underground parts of infected plants. Disease management includes use of clean seed, cultural practices to minimise inoculum and fungicides. Cultivars with different levels of disease resistance are available for some of the crops. However, the pathogen is extremely diverse and new strains evolve frequently, both overcoming host resistances and developing new fungicide resistances. Pathogen adaptation may be counteracted by frequent changing of cultivars and/or mixing fungicides with different modes of action.

Black rot
----------
Bacterial black rot caused by _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _campestris_ is one of the most important diseases of brassica crops, including cabbages, turnips and oilseed rape. The pathogen can also affect cruciferous weeds, which can serve as pathogen reservoirs. The disease affects primarily above ground parts of the plants at any stage of growth. It can cause serious losses in yield and quality, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Disease development is favoured by high humidity and warm temperatures. Symptoms may vary according to host and environmental conditions and generally include characteristic V-shaped leaf lesions, leaf chlorosis, darkening of vascular tissue, extensive wilting and necrosis. Pre-existing fungal lesions may increase the susceptibility of crops to black rot by providing entry points for the bacteria.

The pathogen is seedborne and can also be spread by mechanical means (including insect activity), plant debris, water and wind. Disease management includes clean planting material (seed or transplanted seedlings), cultural practices, removal of weed reservoirs and copper sprays. Some black rot resistant brassica cultivars are available.

Other species and pathovars of _Xanthomonas_ with varying host specificity cause a range of wilts, leaf blights and other diseases on many crops, including vegetables, banana, rice and various fruit trees (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).
