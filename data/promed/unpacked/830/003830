Subject: Foot & mouth disease, beef cattle herd located between Buqata & El Rom, Golan Heights

Message No. 3:

1. In samples received at the Kimron Veterinary Institute's FMD laboratory from the above event, the following FMD virus strain has been identified: FMDV serotype O, ME-SA/PanAsia-2/ANT10. This is the same topotype circulating last year [2022].

2. In samples received from the Hebron area [Palestinian Authority, PA], FMD virus strain of the same serotype, topotype, lineage, and sublineage [ME-SA/PanAsia-2/ANT10] has been identified.

The genotyping results are indicative of some differences between the 2.

[The new event, affecting beef cattle in Buq'ata-El Rom, on the Golan Heights (north-east Israel), and the mentioned outbreak in the Hebron district (southern part of the West Bank, PA), of which the affected species has not been disclosed, are assumed to have separate origins. The distance between the 2, as the crow flies, is round 190 km [118 mi]. During 2022, Israel and the West Bank experienced numerous outbreaks caused by the FMD ME-SA/PanAsia-2/ANT10 strain (originating in Jordan), while the Golan experienced none (map at https://wahis.woah.org/#/in-review/4305). The current Golan event is located near the Syrian border; its origin could be sought within Israel or transboundary (Syria).

Further molecular studies of the strains behind the 2 events are expected to decipher their respective origins. Such and additional studies are expected also to help selecting matching vaccine strains to be included in vaccines applied during 2023 in Israel, the PA, Jordan, and regionally. - Mod.AS
