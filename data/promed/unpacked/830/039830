Outbreaks of adenovirus infection in mental health facilities
-------------------------------------------------------------
17 people were admitted to hospital after an outbreak of a viral illness in
8 mental health facilities in Brockton and nearby towns, a state Department
of Public Health spokeswoman said on Tue 21 Jun 2005. A total of 28 clients
and staff in 8 state Department of Mental Health (DPH) facilities in the
area contracted adenovirus infection, said Donna Rheaume, DPH spokeswoman.
Doctors say [adenovirus infections are common]. An unknown number of
clients from New Beginnings Club House at 591 Centre St in Brockton, which
is run by the state Department of Mental Health, were among those who
became ill. 17 people were taken to Brockton Hospital and 15 who became ill
developed pneumonia, Rheaume said. Rheaume said there is no public health
risk. "The community was never at risk," Rheaume said. "This virus requires
very close contact for transmission."
Rheaume would not name the towns or exact location of the other facilities
for confidentiality reasons. Clients and staff of the state Department of
Mental Health reportedly became ill between 23 May and 17 Jun 2005, with
the most recent case reported on Fri 17 Jun 2005, she said. "It appears
right now that this [outbreak] is under control," she said.
Helen Singh, a nurse at the Brockton Board of Health, said a board nurse
inspected the New Beginnings location last week after receiving reports of
several people becoming ill from a flu-like syndrome. "There were a few
more cases than usual," Singh said Tuesday. "They seem to be clients from
one area." Singh did not have an exact number of people stricken at the
Brockton facility. 2 people were clients from Brockton Area Multi-Services
Inc (BAMS). and are being treated locally, said Charles Fiske, BAMSI spokesman.
Fiske said BAMSI was alerted about the outbreak by the Department of Mental
Health a week ago. "The cause of it is unknown at this point," he said.
Symptoms of adenovirus include coughing, fever, aches and diarrhea, said Dr
Brian Dolan, director of the hospitalist program at Brockton Hospital. The
virus is spread through air droplets by coughing or hand-to-mouth
transmission. It can manifest itself as gastroenteritis or as an upper
respiratory infection like pneumonia, he said. "It's kind of an ideal virus
to cause a local outbreak," Dolan said.
[Adenovirus infection] tends to run its course within one to 2 weeks and
may take longer for people with other medical problems, he said. Treatment
may include administering intravenous fluids, breathing treatments and
anti-viral medications, Dolan said. Adenovirus is known to cause outbreaks
in closed populations such as military barracks, nursing homes or
facilities for the mentally handicapped, he said. Military personnel are
[were] commonly vaccinated against adenovirus, he said. [The vaccines used
were against adenovirus types 4 and 7, but recurrent production problems
led to their withdrawal. - Mod.CP] Rheaume said the virus is spread
primarily through saliva by sharing food or beverages. "All of the
facilities have implemented careful respiratory precautions, including not
sharing food and other precautions," she said. "We feel as though this is
under control."

[The adenoviruses comprise a large number of distinct serotypes. Adenovirus
infections are mostly asymptomatic, but certain serotypes are associated
with diseases of the gastrointestinal, ocular, and respiratory systems. The
serotypes associated with respiratory illness are types 3, 4, 7, and 21,
and live and inactivated vaccines have been developed but not employed
widely except by the military. It is newsworthy here that the symptoms are
described as "flu-like", emphasizing the fact that many viruses other than
the influenza viruses can be responsible for serious outbreaks of
respiratory disease. It would be interesting to have information concerning
the particular serotype (or serotypes) associated with these outbreaks in
mental health facilities in Massachusetts. - Mod.CP]
