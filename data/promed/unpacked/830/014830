According to WTSP, the Florida Department of Health in Hillsborough County is reporting an increase in cryptosporidium cases since 1 Jul 2014. Public health officials say that 157 cases have been reported by DOH-Hillsborough in the last 2 months. Last year [2013], there were only 11 cases during the same time period.

Many of those sickened spent time at day care or schools during the incubation period. Most of those sickened are under the age of 15.

_Cryptosporidium_ is a parasite that is passed through infected feces. It is spread after improper hand washing after using the bathroom or changing diapers. It spreads easily in chlorinated swimming pools and through hand-to-mouth contact.

Because of this alarming increase in the case count, officials are asking the public to help prevent the spread of this disease. Practice good hygiene at all times. Always wash your hands with soap and water after using the toilet, before and after taking care of someone who is ill, and after changing diapers. Wash your hands before and during food preparation. And remember that hand sanitizers are not effective against crypto; only soap and water work well. No one who has been ill with diarrhea should swim in pools, enter splash pads or hot tubs, or go into a spa until two weeks have passed after complete recovery.

When you are at a pool, take a shower before you enter. Only change diapers in the bathroom; never at poolside. Take children on frequent bathroom breaks while they are swimming. Wash hands well after contact with animals. And stay home when you are sick with diarrhea or vomiting.
