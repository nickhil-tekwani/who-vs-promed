NEPALGUNJ, Dec 25 - The number of paralysis victims in two neighbouring
Tharu villages have been increasing as reports of more cases continue to
pour in here.
It is now estimated that paralysis victims in Zhandawa alone number 41
whereas in Razhena VDC eight new victims were reported today taking the
cases in that VDC to 22. With the latest additions, the number of
paralysis victims in the two villages now number 63.
Meanwhile, additional eight cases from a single family has been reported
from another village. The cases all come from the home of Shiva Lal
Chaudhary in Nauwasta village, according to information provided by
ChaudharyÂ’s sister.
The Banke district public health office is rushing a team of doctors and
paramedics to the affected villages on Saturday to control the situation,
public health officials said. The office has already brought four victims
to a hospital and has put them under medical observation.
So far, no definite cause of the mysterious illness has been found out,
though doctors suspect the victims to have consumed contaminated food.
Dr Anil Kumar of Nepalgunj Medical College located at Kohalpur said that
the victims were afflicted with a form of neuritis - inflammation of the
nerves - causing weakness and loss of sensation in the lower limbs.
"The illness results from nutritional factors", Dr Kumar said and added
that most of the patients had said that they ate dried soya chunks bought
at the market just before coming down with the illness. Dr Kumar informed
that his hospital had treated 30 paralysis victims from Banke and
neighbouring Bardia districts in the last one and half months.
Reports of contaminated edible oil and other adulterated food stuff
regularly surface in Terai towns. A few months ago, contaminated mustard
oil in neighbouring Indian states killed dozens of people and caused a
widespread scare in India and Nepal.
