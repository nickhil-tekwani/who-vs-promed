The Veterinary Services wing on Saturday [15 Jun 2013] completed its ring-vaccination measures in and around Suleipal under Kaniha block of Angul district even as one more person of the anthrax-hit village has developed symptoms of the disease.

The total number of the people affected by the disease has gone up to 26, of which 19 have been admitted to the SCB Medical College and Hospital here. Five patients have tested positive for cutaneous anthrax infection, though it is yet to be officially confirmed. Blood smears and wound swabs from all the patients have been sent to the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), New Delhi, and the official confirmation is awaited, hospital sources said.

The veterinary wing on Saturday [15 Jun 2013] said the containment measures covered the entire target region, with more than 7300 livestock including cattle and goats vaccinated. The ring vaccination was carried out in 13 villages around a 10-km radius of Suleipal village.

Ten teams comprising veterinary surgeons, livestock inspectors and health workers conducted the drive across the region and covered the entire livestock population. All the villages were also subjected to intensive sanitation and disinfection measures. "There has been no new animal casualty due to the suspected outbreak in the last 3 days. The containment and prevention measures could have been completed much earlier but for incessant monsoon rains that affected movement of the teams," Chief District Veterinary Officer, Angul, Dr Sachidananda Patnaik said.

While the expert team from the Animal Disease Research Institute (ADRI) at Phulnakhara here has collected samples from more than 150 animals and sent them for testing to the Regional Disease Diagnosis Laboratory (RDDL) at Kolkata, the situation in the region would be monitored closely.

"As Angul was a non-endemic region for anthrax, the development has necessitated intense supervision not only for the present but for years together. Vaccination of the animals, particularly livestock, would be conducted for a minimum of 10 years to ensure that the disease is eliminated.

[It appears that the local medical clinical laboratory has confirmed the anthrax diagnosis in 5 patients, but the "formal" confirmation by the NICD in New Delhi is still awaited. As this started probably around 10-11 Jun 2013, this is acceptable. We should have heard the results of any sample taken from the suspect goats and cattle by now. Getting the 7300 head of cattle and goats vaccinated in 13 villages in 2-3 days is impressive, even with 10 teams.

The interesting component are the over 150 animal samples collected and sent for testing at the Regional Disease Diagnosis Laboratory (RDDL) at Kolkata. Were these suspect anthrax cases or just sick stock and the opportunity get some answers to chronic problems brought to the teams' notice by the villagers? If any samples turn out to be _B. anthracis_-positive, it will reflect a larger anthrax problem than previously perceived. As it is the monsoon season, I hope that they also took the opportunity to collect feed samples on farms with probable livestock anthrax cases.
