[2] Cholera - China (Hainan)

An 8-year-old girl died of complications due to a cholera outbreak in
Hainan Province in late October 2008. There have been a confirmed 30
cases and 297 others, which are suspected to be cholera in Danzhou City.

The Danzhou Hsingyin Hospital has to set up 5 temporary tents with
warning signs to treat the many patients. As of 22 Oct 2008, there
have been 135 people hospitalized with cholera or are suspected of
cholera infection. 60 patients are currently in the Hsingyin Hospital.

Local doctors said that Huangyu Village is one of the most severely
hit areas. Many villagers have suffered from persistent and frequent
diarrhea accompanied by vomiting. An 8-year-old girl was sent to the
emergency room at the First People's Hospital due to severe
dehydration resulting from the diarrhea and later died from complications.

Experts believe that the flood caused by heavy rainfall in the south
in early October 2007 is the cause of the cholera outbreak. It is
reported that the earliest cholera case occurred 4 months ago. On 12
Jun [2008], a patient, along with 57 others ate food at Heili Village
in Haikou City; 26 of them later suffered from diarrhea. The patient
was transferred from local clinic to Haikou City People's Hospital
for emergency care due to severe symptoms. On 19 Jun 2008, the
Disease Control Center confirmed that the patient was infected with
_Vibrio cholerae_.

As many as 35 people in Ha Tinh City have been stricken with acute
diarrhea. The latest information from the provinces Preventive
Healthcare Centre said that of those affected by acute diarrhea, 11
have tested positive for _Vibrio cholera_ bacteria.

Thach Kim Commune in Loc Ha District is the hardest hit with 30
people hospitalized as of yesterday [10 Nov 2008] morning due to the
epidemic. 2 household wells in the commune were tested by the centre
and found to contain the bacteria.

The epidemic may have originated from Quynh Phuong Commune, Quynh Luu
District of Nghe An Province, according to Nguyen Luong Tam, vice
director of the centre. The 1st patient was hospitalized on [2 Nov
2008]. It appears he contracted the disease while fishing in Thach
Kim Commune, Loc Ha District.

Dao Van The, director of the Preventive Healthcare Centre of Loc Ha
District, said that about 2500 people in Thach Kim Commune were
living without toilets and often relieved themselves on the beach. "A
more serious concern is that residents often wash fish with the local
water source and sell them to other areas," said The.

[6] Cholera, refugees - Congo DR (North Kivu)
Date: Tue 11 Nov 2008

A cholera outbreak in a refugee camp has spread to eastern Congo's
provincial capital of Goma, as humanitarian groups called for more UN
(United Nations) peacekeepers to protect civilians caught up in the
fighting between government forces and rebel troops.

Human Rights Watch said the UN Security Council should bolster the 17
000-strong UN force in Congo, the world's biggest UN peacekeeping
mission, by 3000 soldiers and police. The call for more peacekeepers
came amid fears that cholera will deepen the misery of a quarter of a
million people who have fled their homes since late August 2008 in
the upsurge of fighting between the forces of rebel general Laurent
Nkunda, Congolese army soldiers and their allied militia.

Cholera cases rose slightly yesterday [10 Nov 2008] in the towns of
Goma and Kibati, with at least 90 known cases and 6 new admissions
overnight. Officials with Doctors Without Borders said the cases they
were treating were well contained. Only 4 new ones were reported at
the group's clinic in Kibati camp. But dozens of people have died of
cholera in recent weeks elsewhere in eastern Congo. Doctors also fear
an epidemic behind rebel lines, where access has been limited by
fighting and rebels have driven tens of thousands of people from
camps where outbreaks had been contained.

[7] Cholera - Mozambique

Fears that cholera may be spreading throughout central Mozambique has
forced the government to issue the highest state of alert.

"We are dealing with a cholera outbreak and unfortunately it has
already started spreading," Fernanda Teixeira, secretary general of
the Red Cross in Mozambique told IRIN. "In the beginning we were not
sure if it was cholera because of the high mortality rates."

According to Mozambique's National Disaster Management Agency (INGC),
"Samples collected for laboratory examination confirmed a cholera
epidemic on the 5 Nov 2008." Some 250 cases and 48 fatalities have
been registered.

A rapid assessment conducted by Oxfam, the British-based development
NGO, pointed to Guro district in the central Manica Province as the
epicentre, and indicated that the outbreak started on 24 Oct [2008].
New cases have also been registered in Tete and Zambezia provinces.

Mozambique started recording cases of cholera in Zambezia province as
early as October 2007. Before the current spike, 7547 cases with 78
deaths were recorded between October 2007 and October 2008, according
to the health ministry. Only 3 provinces -- Sofala, Cabo Delgado, and
Gaza -- have not registered any cases of cholera in the past 60 days,
the UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) report said.

"We have cholera every year, but never with such high mortality
rates. The situation now seems under control," Teixeira commented.
But with the rainy season quickly approaching, "cases could again go up."

[8] Cholera - Zimbabwe

Zimbabwe has reported a severe outbreak of cholera since August 2008.
So far, a total of 1224 cases have been confirmed, with a total of 42
deaths. The worst affected areas are Harare, Nyamapanda, Chinhoyi,
and Kariba. The situation is still unfolding as cholera spread to
other parts of the country.

A cholera outbreak has hit the high density suburbs of Harare, the
capital city of Zimbabwe, border town Nyamapanda in Mashonaland
Central Province and Kariba (Mola) in Mashonaland West and provincial
town Chinhoyi also in Mashonaland West. An unconfirmed case has been
reported in Mutare in Manicaland Province, which is on the border
with Mozambique. The 1st cholera case was reported on 26 Aug 2008,
long before the rainy season, which usually starts at the end of
October. Current reports indicate that cholera continues to spread
across the country due to high mobility and limited capacity to
contain the disease.
