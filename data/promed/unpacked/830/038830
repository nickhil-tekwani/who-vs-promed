Successive new bluetongue infections
-----------------------------------------
The bluetongue virus (BT) spreads quicker than last year [2006].
Following the 1st case of 2007, discovered last week [23-27 Jul 2007]
in Bavel [North Brabant], several new infections have been detected
within one single day. This information has been announced by the
Ministry of Agriculture yesterday [Mon 29 Jul 2007]. The total number
of infections detected in the Netherlands as of Mon 30 Jul 2007 has
not been disclosed by the Ministry.
The new cases have been found, among others, in [the provinces] Zuid
Limburg [South Limburg], Noord Brabant [North Brabant], and Zuid
Holland [South Holland]. All of them are within the BT-restricted
perimeter zone (20-km zone) [12.4-mile zone]; therefore no
modification of the currently prevailing bluetongue policy is
currently required.
The virus has been detected in cattle and sheep. "It concerns
clinically manifested as well as well as symptomless cases," said the
spokesman of the Ministry.
The entomologist of the Wageningen University, Willem Takken, said
last week that the spread of the bluetongue virus this year will
probably be quicker than in 2006. This is caused by the fact that the
climatic conditions for the development of the vector-midges are more
favorable.
Last year, 16 infection sites were recorded within 5 days following
the 1st outbreak of 17 Aug 2006. After 100 days, there were 426
infected farms, including 257 sheep farms, 167 cattle operations and
2 mixed farms (cattle and sheep). [The final 2006 figures, included
in a Dutch presentation at

were: 176 cattle holdings, 250 sheep holdings, 34 mixed holdings, 0
goat holdings; total 460 holdings. - Mod.AS].
