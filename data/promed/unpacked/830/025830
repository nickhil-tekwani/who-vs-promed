Since the beginning of September [2018], 28 children got sick with measles in one of the Vinnytsia region schools. Tetiana Bondarenko, the head of disease treatment and prevention for children of Health Department of Vinnytsia Regional State Administration claimed this as BBC Ukraine reported.

The measles outbreak is connected with the fact that the parents refuse the vaccination. According to Bondarenko, all the sick children were not vaccinated or did not have the follow-up vaccination. "In the region, there are enough vaccines for the children's protective vaccination coverage," she noted.

It is reported that the incidence of measles in Vinnytsia region increased since the beginning of a school year. 83 cases of the measles, including 71 cases involving children were spotted in the region during a week. Earlier it was reported that as of 12 Sep 2018, 30 744 persons have been sickened with measles since the beginning of 2018.

Earlier Moldova imposed the "orange" threat level on the results of the session of the national emergency commission for public health. It is noted that most of the cases were spotted in the southern regions of Moldova. Also, the European Health Security Agency reported that, in Europe, only Romania and Italy had reported more people infected with measles in 2017 [2017 or 2018? - Mod.SH] than Ukraine.

[3] Israel: reduction in immunization

A child admitted to Schneider Children's Hospital in Petah Tivkva was reported to have contracted measles on Tuesday morning [2 Oct 2018]. The one year old toddler was admitted last week to Schneider's Emergency Medical Department, where he was diagnosed with the infectious disease.

Following the diagnosis, some 70 children inside the hospital who were exposed to the child were quickly removed from the premises and the few children that were at risk were given preventative treatment according to the Health Ministry. Professor Yitzhack Levy, director of the infectious disease unit at Schneider said in a statement on Tue: "We are experiencing an increase in measles cases due to a reduction in immunization. We urge parents to immunize their children against this disease."

This latest case came despite the Health Ministry's recommendation that all Israelis be vaccinated against measles. A total of 42 residents of Israel were reported to have contracted measles during June, and 130 in March [2018].

[4] Israel: increase in cases

The number of measles cases in Israel has risen by an annual rate of 1782 per cent since the beginning of the year, from 34 cases in 2017 to 480 in January-September 2018, according to figures published [Wed 3 Oct 2018] by the state's Ministry of Health. The outbreak began in March 2018, when 8 cases were recorded. In April and May more than 30 measles cases were recorded each month, and in June and July the number of patients reached 75 each. In August and September, the year's highest number of patients was recorded with 127 for each month.

The Israeli Ministry of Health attributes the outbreak of measles in the country to the exposure of an unvaccinated population to infected people who came from Europe. Measles is considered the most contagious disease. The chance that a person not immunized exposed to a patient [will become infected] is as high as 90 per cent.

The measles virus, paramyxovirus, causes patients rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation, and fever. The disease can cause, in later stages, ear infections, diarrhea, inflammation of the cornea, pneumonia, and rare complications such as brain inflammation, nervous system damage, and even death. The risk of complications of the disease is higher among children under the age of 5.

Between January and August 2018, more than 42 000 children were infected throughout Europe, and 14 of them died from complications.

Weekly bulletin on outbreaks and other emergencies - Week 38: 15-21 Sep 2018; data as reported by 21 Sep 2018
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Measles in Chad
---------------
2734 suspected cases / 78 deaths / 2.9% case fatality rate

Event description
-----------------
The measles outbreak in Chad which started at the beginning of 2018 continues to evolve. Since our last situation report on 5 Aug 2018 (Weekly Bulletin 33), 845 new suspected cases and 6 deaths were reported. Of these, 136 were tested and 90 new confirmed and 2 clinically compatible cases have been reported. In week 36 (week ending 9 Sep 2018), 155 suspected cases were reported including 1 death. The peak of the outbreak was in week 33 (week ending 19 Aug 2018) when 237 suspected cases were reported.

Between week 1 and week 36 (week ending 9 Sep 2018), a total of 2734 suspected cases of measles were reported including 78 deaths (case fatality rate 2.9%). Of these, 602 were sampled and tested, 231 were laboratory confirmed, 419 had epidemiological links to confirmed cases, and 30 were clinically compatible. Of the 2734 suspected cases of measles, 1021 cases were investigated. The average age is 9.9 years and the median age was 6 years. About 39% of the affected people are 4 years of age and below, 23% are between 5 and 9 years, and 37% are 10 years and above. Only 15% (150) of the investigated cases had previously been vaccinated against measles.

In the reporting week, 2 new districts reported a confirmed case, Mao and Karal. As of reporting date, a total of 27 districts have had a confirmed measles outbreak. These districts include: Abeche, Abdi, Abougoudam, Adre, Am dam, Ati, Arada, Bardai, Bokoro, Fada, Gama, Goz Beida, Guereda, Haraze Mangueigne, Mongo, Rig Rig, Tissi, Kouloudja, Kirdimi, Karal, Mao, Matadjana, Massakory, Massaguet, N'Djamena East, N'Djamena South, and Zouar.

Public health actions
---------------------
The National Epidemic Management Committee is meeting weekly to plan and coordinate response to the ongoing measles outbreak, with involvement of partners.

The Ministry of Health, WHO, UNICEF, and partners have developed a national measles outbreak response plan and efforts are ongoing to mobilize resources for implementation of the plan.

Part of the routine measles vaccine stock is being used for the response in epidemic districts. UNICEF has provided 900 000 additional doses of measles vaccine.

Epidemiological investigation is being conducted at district level, including collecting specimens and documentation of cases.

Situation interpretation
------------------------
The outbreak is evolving as the geographic distribution and the number of cases continues to increase. Unvaccinated young children are at highest risk of measles and its complications, including death. During this outbreak, more than 60% of the cases were children below the age of 10 years, with fewer than 20% having received at least one dose of measles vaccine. Thus the case fatality rate has been high.

In order to quickly contain the outbreak, the ongoing response needs to be scaled up accordingly and in a timely manner. The proportion of cases sampled and tested remains low due to multiple challenges such as poor documentation of cases, low sample collection, late delivery of samples to the laboratory and lack of laboratory reagents. It is necessary to strengthen the epidemiological surveillance in all health districts and provide technical support from central level to epidemic districts. Routine measles vaccination for children, combined with mass immunization campaigns are key public health strategies to reduce the incidence of measles cases and deaths.

Moreover, the regular monitoring of response activities with a focus on formative supervision of health personal, mobilization of resources for the implementation of the response plan in all affected areas is of paramount importance.

[Because fewer then 20% of children under 10 years of age have received at least one dose of measles vaccine, the outbreak is severe, especially with malnutrition probably playing a role exacerbating the disease. Higher mortality has been associated with secondary infections which apparently complicate the primary illness in malnourished children with measles. This is especially true if the children are also vitamin A deficient. Measles, especially with complications such as diarrhea, often results in failure to thrive. Measles may lead to kwashiorkor or marasmus in children who are underweight at the time that they get measles. Therefore, measles may result in, or aggravate, malnutrition, with a poor outcome for the child. - Mod.LK
