30 000 ducks poisoned in Bangladesh
-----------------------------------
Some 30 000 ducks and birds fleeing biting winters in Europe,
Siberia, and the Himalayas have been poisoned by poachers in
northeastern Bangladesh, a report said Saturday.
The birds died after eating food laced with poison by poachers at a
wetland in Habiganj and nearby Sylhet district, some 190 kilometers
(120 miles) northeast of the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka. The Prothom
Alo Bengali-language daily said the figure was based on a report by a
local nature group, which alleged that the killing spree was carried
out in the past week.
Local officials could not be reached immediately for comment. For
decades, Bangladesh has been hosting thousands of ducks and other
birds fleeing the chill.
Experts earlier [in January 2004] told reporters that poaching, loss
of wetlands due to construction of houses and factories, and the
increasing human population -- currently estimated at 130 million --
were all having an impact on bird life. The birds are trapped by
poachers, who sell them in cities, where they are considered a
delicacy. Hunting or trapping of "guest birds" is banned in
Bangladesh.
"The number of birds as well as species has fallen," said
Enamul-Haque, a Bangladeshi bird expert. Some 500 000 birds, mainly
ducks, travel to Bangladesh each winter from Europe, Siberia, and the
Himalayas, he said.
In Dhaka, a pair can sell for up to 2500 taka (43 dollars), but a
number of vendors have gone out of business since authorities started
enforcing a law banning the capture and sale of the birds.

[It's not clear to me how you can poison ducks and still leave them
fit for human consumption. And why would poachers destroy their
source of livelihood? Further information on this episode would be
welcome. - Mod.JW]
