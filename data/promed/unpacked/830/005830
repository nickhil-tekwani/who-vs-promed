The Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Cambodia wishes to advise members of the public that one new human case of avian influenza has been confirmed to be the H5Nl virus. This is the 3rd case this year [2014] and the 50th person to become infected with the H5Nl virus in Cambodia.

The case is from Kratie province. Of the 50 confirmed cases, 38 were children under 14, and 27 of the 50 were female. In addition, since the 1st case happened in Cambodia in 2005, only 16 cases have survived.

A 4-year-old boy from KbalTraclt village, Sre Cha commune, Snourl district, Kratie province was confirmed positive by Institut Pasteur du Cambodge (IPC) on [14th Feb 2014]. The boy had onset of fever and vomiting on [8 Feb 2014]. The boy was detected by the mobile surveillance team during contact tracing of the 2nd confirmed case on [12 Feb 2014]. His symptoms were fever, running nose, vomiting, sore throat and cough. He was admitted to Kratie Provincial Hospital on [13 Feb 2014], and Tamiflu was administered on the same day. The symptoms were mild, and the boy is now in good condition.

The case had direct exposure to dead and sick poultry. The boy played with and carried dead chickens 6 days before developing symptoms. Around mid-January [2014], a high number of poultry (around 350 animals comprising chickens, ducks, and geese) started to die in the village. Animal Health officers took samples from sick/dead chickens on [9 Feb 2014], and they were tested negative for H5N1 by the National Veterinary Research Institute (NAVRI).

National and local Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) are conducting an outbreak investigation and responses following the national protocol.

"Avian influenza H5N1 remains a serious threat to the health of all Cambodians and more so for children, who seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk. There have been 50 cases of H5N1 infection in humans since 2005, and here is the 3rd case of this year [2014]. Children often care for domestic poultry by feeding them, cleaning pens, and gathering eggs. Children may also have closer contact with poultry, as they often treat them as pets and also seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk because they like to play where poultry are found. I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and prevent them from playing with chickens and ducks. Parents and guardians must also make sure children thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water before eating and after any contact with poultry. Hands may carry the virus that cannot be seen by the naked eye. Soap washes away the virus on hands. If children have rapid or difficult breathing, their parents should seek medical attention at the nearest health facility, and attending physicians must be made aware of any exposure to sick or dead poultry," said H.E. Dr. Mam Bunheng, Minster of Health.

A nationwide public health education campaign using the radio was launched at the end of January 2014 with prevention messages. Also, a public health education campaign is being conducted in KhalTrach village, Kratie province, using information, education and communications materials to inform families on how to protect themselves from contracting avian influenza. The government's message is to wash hands often with soap and water, before eating and after coming into contact with poultry; keep children away from poultry; keep poultry away from living areas; do not eat dead or sick poultry; and all poultry eaten should be well cooked.

H5N1 influenza is a flu that normally spreads between sick poultry, but it can sometimes spread from poultry to humans. Human H5N1 avian influenza is a very serious disease that requires hospitalization. Although the virus currently does not easily spread among humans, if the virus changes, it could easily be spread like seasonal influenza. Hence, early recognition of cases is important.

The Ministry of Health will continue to keep the public informed of developments via the MoH website http://www.cdcmoh.gov.kh, where relevant health education materials can also be downloaded.

[The majority of cases of human infection with avian influenza viruses reported this year [2014] have been infected with LPAI A(H7N9) in China. A(H5N1) human infections have been reported in Canada (imported from Beijing, China), Egypt, Viet Nam, and Cambodia since the beginning of 2014 (see prior ProMED-mail posts Avian influenza, human (13): Canada ex China (BJ) H5N1, fatal, case report 20140112.2167282, Avian influenza, human (25): Egypt (DK) H5N1, RFI 20140120.2184238, Avian influenza, human (29): Viet Nam (BP) H5N1, fatal 20140121.2221781, Avian influenza, human (53): China, H5N1, H7N9, update 20140202.2249920, Avian influenza, human (57): Cambodia, H5N1, 1st case in 2014 20140204.2254871, and Avian influenza, human (69): Cambodia (KC) H5N1, death of siblings 20140212.2273521). This represents the 4th reported case of H5N1 infection in Cambodia this year (2014).

Kratie province is located in the central eastern part of Cambodia. Prior cases of human H5N1 infection reported by Cambodia this year (2014) included 2 siblings who died in the same district in Kratie province earlier this month (7 Feb 2014) and a 5-year-old boy from Kampong Thom province (bordering Kratie province to the west).
