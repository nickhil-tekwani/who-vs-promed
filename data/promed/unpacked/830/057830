West Nile Virus-positive Parakeet in Laurens County, Georgia
------------------------------------------------------------
Environmental Health District Director Mark Harden said he received word
from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta this morning that a
parakeet from the Buckeye Community had become the first bird to test
positive for West Nile virus in Laurens County.
Harden said the bird was submitted about 3 weeks ago to the CDC, although
it is not the normal kind of bird the CDC will test. Normally only larger
birds such as crows and blue jays are tested. "We don't normally test
parakeets," said Harden. "But a man who raises birds had some of his
parakeets start dying and couldn't figure out why."
It's been less than 3 weeks since an American Crow in Dodge County tested
positive for the virus. The disease has traveled quickly down the eastern
seaboard, touching 13 states, since West Nile made landfall in the United
States in 1998. Cases of infected birds and humans were reported in New
York and New Jersey, Harden said, and West Nile had made its way as far
south as North Carolina by the end of last year. This Spring the virus hit
Florida. Local officials said if it was found in Florida, it had to
eventually show up in Georgia with so many of the migratory birds traveling
through the state. Health officials in Georgia have reported more than 236
positive infections of birds and 7 among horses in 42 counties. Only one
human fatality has been confirmed in the state when a 72-year-old Fulton
County woman died from symptoms related to the virus. The closest the
disease had reached in middle Georgia prior to the Laurens and Dodge County
discoveries was in Houston and Coffee counties.
Harden said the cooler temperatures will cause a decrease in the mosquito
population, but people should still take precautions when venturing outside
in late evening hours. "The problem will tend to take care of itself
because of the cold weather," he said. "There won't be as many mosquitoes
out in a while, but we still need to caution deer hunters, especially
during the warm days. If they're in the woods there's still a good many
mosquitoes there."
