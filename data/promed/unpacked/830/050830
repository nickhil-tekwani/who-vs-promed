New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Givron, Ardennes
Date of start of the outbreak: 1 Mar 2016
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 394 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0

Affected population: The affected bovine, a Salers female born on 8 Apr 2011, showed paresis and was euthanized on 1 Mar 2016. Samples made on 4 Mar 2016 during rendering were analyzed at the Department Laboratory of La Somme. The rapid test proved positive on 8 Mar 2016, and the samples were then sent for further analysis to the National Reference Laboratory, ANSES, which confirmed a case of classical BSE on 21 Mar 2016. The European Union Reference Laboratory confirmed those results on the basis of documentation on 23 Mar 2016.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment
The last case of classical BSE was detected in 2011. The case detected in 2014 was atypical BSE. A bylaw declaring infection was issued and prohibited any movements until sanitation. A traceability investigation is ongoing to identify animals potentially at risk (cohort and offspring) that will be destroyed. An epidemiological investigation aimed at identifying the potential causes of infection was launched. The requirements applicable to the category of countries with a controlled BSE risk (SRM list) enter into force as of the date 25 Mar 2016.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening; traceability; quarantine; no vaccinated; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: stamping out; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
ANSES TSE National Reference Laboratory, Lyon (National laboratory) / Cattle / Western blot / 21 Mar 2016 / Positive
TSE Molecular Team, Animal and Plant Health Agency, United Kingdom (OIE Reference Laboratory) / Cattle / Western blot / 23 Mar 2016 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.
