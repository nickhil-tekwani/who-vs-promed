Officials have determined an outbreak of equine herpes has occurred at Hawthorne Race Course and a quarantine has been put in place, but racing will continue as scheduled.

Following discussions with state veterinarians, the Department of Agriculture, and consultants from the Kentucky Department of Agriculture, the decision was made to put a quarantine of the affected barn in place to combat the disease, which has manifested in the neurological form in 2 horses. The quarantine is restricted to Barn A.

"We're treating the horses in there and monitoring the horses in Barn A. Horses can still ship in," said Hawthorne Assistant General Manager Jim Miller. "It doesn't affect racing. Racing still continues."

The disease claimed the life of one horse in Barn A and has affected at least one other. 3 other horses are being monitored.

Miller said all 70 horses in the barn will be tested for the disease. Horses with a clean bill of health will be allowed to train during hours set aside only for them.

The track plans to take every precaution during races, including disinfecting the receiving barn every day, the paddock between every race, and the starting gate. The receiving barn is located at the opposite end of the backstretch from the affected barn.

"It's unfortunate," Miller said. "But you want to be safe rather than sorry."

[The disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpes virus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2-10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-viral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease and owners have a difficult time treating, or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
