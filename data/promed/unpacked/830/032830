Following the publication in a Sunday paper of information concerning
the 1st 3 identified cases of farm-animal MRSA [methicillin-resistant
_Staphylococcus aureus_] in humans in the UK, the Soil Association is
calling on the Government to publish interim results of its testing
for MRSA in pigs, which has been ongoing since the beginning of the
year [2008] (1), and introduce a comprehensive testing programme for
MRSA in other farm-animal species.

As reported in The Sunday Post [1 Jun 2008] (2), the Scottish MRSA
Reference Laboratory has identified 3 patients in Scotland suffering
from a new type of MRSA infection, not previously identified in the
UK. The MRSA is a strain known as [multilocus sequence type or MLST]
ST398 or NT-MRSA [non-typeable by PFGE (pulsed field gel
electrophoresis) using Sma-1], which has been spreading rapidly
across continental Europe and some other countries, affecting both
farm animals and humans.

The problem came to light after the Soil Association asked the
Scottish reference laboratory to recheck one suspicious sample, which
was mentioned in a scientific paper, but which had not been fully
tested. Professor Giles Edwards, head of the laboratory, agreed to
this request. He subsequently told the Soil Association about 2
further patients who had also been found to be infected by the same
strain of MRSA.

In the Netherlands and some other countries, a high proportion of
pigs and other farm animals are already carriers of MRSA ST398, and
there have been many cases of humans becoming colonised due to
contact with animals, and then developing serious MRSA infections
(3). Although MRSA ST398 was only first detected in humans in the
Netherlands as recently as 2003, by 2007 approximately 30 percent of
all cases of human MRSA in the Netherlands were ST398 (4).

In a report published in June 2007 (3), the Soil Association warned
that unless urgent action was taken, farm-animal MRSA would spread to
Britain and threaten to complicate and worsen the already serious
MRSA problem in British hospitals. Many other countries have
responded to the Dutch outbreak by testing their own pigs and
publishing the results as rapidly as possible: Belgium, Denmark,
Germany, Spain, and Canada have all confirmed that some of their pigs
are MRSA carriers (5). However, the [UK] Government rejected the Soil
Association's call for British pigs to be tested, indicating that it
would not do this until ST398 was found in humans (6). Testing only
began earlier this year [2008] because of an EU requirement for all
member states to test some of their pigs for MRSA. If interim results
are not published by the Government, no results will be available
before mid-2009 (7).

Soil Association policy adviser, Richard Young, said, "It is
regrettable the Government has allowed this problem to develop, when
action at an early stage could have nipped it in the bud. ST398 is no
more serious than existing strains of MRSA, but it is resistant to
different antibiotics, and where it is present it will make it harder
for doctors to select an effective drug quickly. In some cases this
could be the difference between life and death. It is also likely to
increase the overall number of MRSA cases in humans, because farm
animals are kept in such large numbers on intensive farms and
constitute a growing reservoir of this superbug worldwide. We
suspect that MRSA has now been found in British pigs. Defra (UK
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) must publish the
results of testing as these become available (8). There can now be no
excuse for not also initiating a comprehensive testing programme in
the UK to establish the full extent of MRSA in British farm animals."

Notes to editors
----------------
1. A European Commission Decision (2008/55/EC) requires all member
states to carry out an MRSA survey of pigs from herds with breeding
pigs from 1 Jan 2008 to 31 Dec 2008. Dr Kris De Smet, who is
responsible for the management of legislation on the monitoring of
zoonoses at DG SANCO (EU Directorate General for Health and Consumer
Protection) has told us that the results are the property of the
member states and that each country can decide whether to publish
intermediate results.

6. Lord Rooker [Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs], said in July 2007, "Broadening the scope of work
in this area should only be considered after analysis of the current
findings relating to humans in the UK with MRSA infections. The
particular strain of MRSA (ST398) occurring in pigs in some other
parts of Europe was not reported to have been detected so far in
humans in the UK, and this was a key consideration in reaching the
decision taken."

7. The final results will be submitted to the European Commission,
which will publish them in mid-2009. See: 'Ongoing and potential
future EC activities on monitoring and control of MRSA', De Smet K.,

Brussels on 8 Apr 2008 by the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe.

8. When Defra was testing milk for MRSA, the interim results (all
negative) were published at regular intervals.

[Non-typeable (NT)-MRSA by pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
using Sma-1 and belonging to multilocus sequence type (MLST) ST 398
initially was detected in the Netherlands in pigs and pig farmers in
2003. This strain of presumably animal origin (nearly 40 percent of
pigs in the Netherlands have been found to be colonized by this
strain) is now reported to be responsible for more than 20 percent of
all MRSA infections in the Netherlands
(<http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/568512>), and has been found in
community-associated human infections in several European countries,
North America, and Asia. Nosocomial transmission of this strain has
also been reported recently among patients and health care workers in
the Netherlands
(<http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/eccmid18/abstract.asp?id=69352>).
