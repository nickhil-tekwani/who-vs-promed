Cattle are being transported from Tamil Nadu into Kerala without
proper anthrax vaccination certificates issued by the animal husbandry
department, say officials. And there is no facility to ensure that
each [animal] is vaccinated, they add.

This adds to the anthrax scare that looms large over the district with
the death of 2 anthrax-infected cows on Friday [30 Dec 2011] and 2
buffaloes earlier that week.

"There is no mechanism to inspect animals coming through the
check-posts into Kerala. Had cattle been vaccinated, there wouldn't
have been animal deaths due to anthrax in Kerala. We are planning to
undertake an anthrax vaccination drive in Kuriachira," said Thrissur
Animal Husbandry Department deputy director V Rajan.

Mammen Ebraham, associate professor, Dept of Pathology, Veterinary
College & Animal Sciences, Mannuthy said, "Even though the blood and
serum samples of animals brought to Kuriachira slaughter house were
found to be negative, we cannot say for sure that they have not been
infected with anthrax. It is difficult to diagnose the disease in the
initial stage. It can be detected only after an animal is dead."

According to experts, cattle should be vaccinated with anthrax spore
vaccine before the monsoon season. They are usually infected by
anthrax, caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, through [contaminated] seeds
and grass, or through direct contact with the infected animals from
areas where the disease is endemic.

Thrissur Corporation has neither veterinary doctors to examine animals
nor a cremation furnace to burn the carcass of dead animals. The post
of the veterinary doctor has been lying vacant for 2 years. It is the
district veterinary officials who have been inspecting animals.

"We buried the dead cattle near the Kuriachira slaughter house on
Friday [30 Dec 2011] as there is no cremation furnace facility there,"
Corporation health superintendent VC Balasubramanyam said.

[Tamil Nadu has been a long time serious threat to its neighbours as
anthrax is a constant in the Indian government reports to OIE. In the
more detailed recent OIE reports anthrax outbreaks in Tamil Nadu
cattle (sometimes involving sheep and goats) occurred from 2002 up to
the present. In just the 1st 6 months of 2011 some 3 reports involving
at least 10 cattle are listed by OIE WAHID. In contrast Kerala had one
reported cattle outbreak in 2005; Kerala is more notable for wildlife
cases, usually involving elephants. So on the face of it the Kerala
veterinary authorities are wise on insisting that cattle coming into
Kerala be vaccinated, if needs be at the border.

If the animals suspected of having had anthrax were inspected
post-mortem -- they had died -- their blood should have contained _B.
anthracis_ vegetative cells; non-survival would have hindered the
development of antibodies. M'Fadyean staining of blood smears should
show the presence of capsulated cells, which is quick and easy.
Culturing on sheep blood agar works well but if there is overgrowth
with contaminants it can be a challenge to the less experienced. And
if there have been delays in the blood reaching the laboratory, ph
changes associated with decomposition will have killed the vegetative
cells. Which is why it is best to take blood swab samples as
sporulation can and will occur.

All in all, the sensitivity to this perceived threat by the Kerala
veterinary authorities indicates that bovine anthrax cases may be more
frequent than the records indicate. - Mod.MHJ]
