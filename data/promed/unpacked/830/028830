China: death of 2 boys sparks rabies vaccine investigation
----------------------------------------------------------
A major investigation is under way following the deaths of 2 boys who
received rabies inoculations in Guandong Province. Both deaths occurred
less than 2 weeks apart in Guangdong's Wengyuan County, and now the Food
and Drug Administration is looking into the batch of vaccine concerned.
Zhong Yuwang died of rabies on 28 Jun 2005 after being bitten by a dog on
his left hand and foot. He had received a month long course of 4 injections
against the disease, but instead of speeding his recovery, the drug seemed
to make him weaker, officials said. A few days after Zhong's death, another
boy died of the same symptoms after he had received the same treatment at
the same clinic.
Initial investigations indicate that improper storage of the vaccine during
transportation somehow affected the vaccine, making it ineffective in
fighting against the disease, said He Jingquan, a director with the
Provincial Food and Drug Administration. He said the vaccine was not kept
refrigerated during its 2-hour journey from a drug wholesaler in Shaoguan
to the family planning service center in Wengyuan, where the boys received
their injections. The investigation has also uncovered that neither the
medical service facility nor the drug wholesaler in Shaoguan were properly
qualified to handle the vaccine, he said.
"The Ministry of Health will draft a national guideline on vaccination,
requiring all doctors to be more careful how they buy and administer
vaccines," Deng Haihua, director of the information office of the ministry,
said. However, better coordination between health and drug supervision
departments should be implemented to ensure safer vaccinations in the
future, Deng noted.
In China, supervision of the production and marketing of vaccines is done
by the drug supervision department. The health departments are only in
charge of managing doctors. While management remains split between 2
departments, problems can easily crop up as the vaccine goes from producers
to the market and then to patients, Deng said.

[This report describes the apparent failure of post-exposure treatment of
rabies virus infection in 2 young boys who had contracted infection by dog
bite in separate incidents. Details of the outcome of the official
investigation will be welcomed. Failure to maintain the vaccine at low
temperature for a period of 2 hours during transit might affect the
antigenicity of the vaccine, but other factors should be considered. - Mod.CP]
