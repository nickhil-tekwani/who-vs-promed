More than 200 cases of equine influenza (EI) have been confirmed by laboratory testing in Britain so far this year [2019], compared with just 2 outbreaks [see comment] reported in 2018. Dr Richard Newton, The Animal Health Trust's (AHT) Director of Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance, said the effect of increased horse movement and mixing of horses at events in the summer was a contributing factor.

The latest 3 cases were confirmed on 10 and 11 Jul [2019].

On 10 Jul 2019, The Animal Health Trust confirmed outbreaks on premises in West Yorkshire and West Midlands. The laboratory confirmed that both were positive and in non-thoroughbreds with an unconfirmed vaccination status that presented with coughing, nasal discharge and pyrexia. Several other horses at the West Yorkshire yard were reported to be showing clinical signs, and the in-contact number was unknown. The positive diagnosis was confirmed by a nasopharyngeal swab.

On 11 Jul 2019, an outbreak of EI was confirmed in Pembrokeshire, with positive test results in 2 unvaccinated non-Thoroughbreds that presented with coughing, nasal discharge and pyrexia. There are 2 other horses displaying clinical signs, with a further 5 in contact.

"Alarmingly the number of outbreaks of equine influenza continues to rise and [is] likely to continue week-on-week for the foreseeable future," Newton said. "We applaud those horse shows and events which have made vaccination mandatory, have arrangements to check passports and enforce the rules." Newton said the AHT encouraged event organisers to make vaccination mandatory, and to ensure the decision is communicated in plenty of time ahead of their event to allow owners the time to properly vaccinate their animals.

[Equine influenza (EI), an OIE-listed disease, is an acute respiratory infection of horses, donkeys, mules, and zebras. The virus strain that has been found to be circulating in the UK (and several other countries in Europe) since early 2019, is EIV H3N8 Florida clade 1. Some of the cases were recorded in vaccinated horses, causing alarm.

The data included in the above report, namely, "more than 200 cases confirmed by laboratory testing in Britain so far this year [2019], compared with just 2 outbreaks reported in 2018", are in need of some explanation, on top of being, seemingly, incommensurable.

According to OIE's terrestrial Animal Health Code glossary, "outbreak" means "the occurrence of one or more cases in an epidemiological unit". "Case" means "an individual animal infected by a pathogenic agent, with or without clinical signs"; and "epidemiological unit" means "a group of animals with a defined epidemiological relationship that share approximately the same likelihood of exposure to a pathogenic agent. This may be because they share a common environment (such as, animals in a pen), or because of common management practices. Usually, this is a herd or a flock. However, an epidemiological unit may also refer to groups such as animals belonging to residents of a village, or animals sharing a communal animal handling facility. The epidemiological relationship may differ from disease to disease, or even strain to strain of the pathogenic agent."

While the 2 mentioned EI "outbreaks" in 2018 may comply with the above definition (to definitely know, more detail is required), the "more than 200" cases in 2019 probably relate to the number of positive lab results of clinically suspected individual animals and not to "cases" as defined; confirmation or otherwise would be helpful.

In any event, clearly there has been a striking increase in the number of EIV H3N8 Florida clade 1 "cases" AND "outbreaks" during the recent months. In view of the disease not being officially reportable in the UK, the obtained information is highly remarkable; however, exact figures may eventually remain unknown. - Mod.AS
