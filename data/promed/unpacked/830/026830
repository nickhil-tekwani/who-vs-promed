Cheese recalled in _E. coli_ scare
--------------------------
Capital Health issued a recall on all cheese made by Eyot Creek Farms after
learning an outbreak of _E. coli_ might be linked to product from the
Leduc-based dairy, said Capital Health medical officer of health Dr. Gerry
Predy.
7 confirmed cases from November and December 2002 have been reported. In 3
cases, cheese was bought at farmers' markets in Old Strathcona, and 3
others were found during laboratory tests, Predy said. "It can be very
serious. It can sometimes be fatal," he said.
Capital Health typically sees about 50 cases of infection from _E. coli_
O157:H7 every year, Predy said. The organism is most frequently caused by
eating undercooked hamburger.
"They make their cheese from unpasteurized milk, and it's not uncommon for
unpasteurized milk to have bacteria in it, and that's why we pasteurize
most of our dairy products," he said.
In a press release, Eyot Creek said "at this point the offending bacteria
have not been found in our cheese.We have consistently complied with
federal and provincial health and food safety regulations in every aspect
of our cheesemaking enterprise."
Federal regulations do allow dairy farmers to make cheese from
unpasteurized milk, said Predy.
"We're still investigating, so we don't know for sure what exactly happened
at the farm," said Predy. He said he wasn't sure how much cheese Eyot
Creek Farms has sold, and Capital Health has asked the dairy not to sell
any more until its investigation is finished.
Symptoms of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection appear within 2 to 8 days after the
ingestion of contaminated food. They include mild to severe diarrhea, which
is sometimes bloody, abdominal cramps, and sometimes fever.
Eyot Creek Farms makes gouda cheese based on the traditional Dutch method.
It has been making and selling its special brand of cheese since 1984.

Outbreak of _E. coli_ possibly linked to cheese sold at Edmonton Farmers'
Markets
-------------------------------
An outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection identified in the Capital Health
region may be linked to cheese sold at farmers' markets in Edmonton.
Capital Health is advising those who purchased cheese from farmers' markets
in the Edmonton area produced by Eyot Creek Farms Ltd., Leduc, Alberta
should immediately throw away any remaining cheese. The cheese was sold at
farmers' markets and not grocery stores. Those who are currently
experiencing diarrhea after consuming cheese from this producer should
consult a physician.
"Capital Health typically sees about 50 cases of _E. coli_ O157:H7
infection a year. We're calling this an outbreak because we saw an unusual
number of cases in a short period of time, and we can link them to a common
exposure," says Dr. Gerry Predy, Capital Health's Medical Officer of Health.
"We've linked 6 recent cases of E. coli O157:H7 infection to cheese from
this one manufacturer'" says Predy.

[Although the source of this outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 has yet to be
determined, the suspicion of a cheese made from unpasteurized milk once
again brings up the specter of diseases transmitted by dairy products
produced from this vehicle. - Mod.LL]
[In 1998 ProMED-mail reported on an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157 associated
with unpasteurized milk in the UK in 1998 (see refs below in see
also's). To further highlight the hazards of consumption of unpasteurized
dairy products, we have included prior ProMED-mail postings on a variety of
bacterial organisms related to unpasteurized dairy products. - Mod. MPP]
