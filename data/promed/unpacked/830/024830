Yellow fever in Cote d'Ivoire: First African Urban Epidemic for 10 Years
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has reported 128 suspected cases, with 14 deaths in
the entire country [map available at the WHO website. Of these, 20 cases
were confirmed by the Institut Pasteur, Cote d'Ivoire.
In Abidjan (population 3.5 million), 20 suspected cases have been notified,
of which 6 cases have been confirmed by the laboratory and 4 have died. As
of Tue 4 Sep 2001, 5 out of the 10 communes in the city have reported
cases. This is the first epidemic of yellow fever reported in an urban
setting in Africa in 10 years.
In response to this outbreak, the Ministry of Health has organized targeted
vaccinations in areas where confirmed cases have been identified. In
Abidjan a targeted vaccination campaign is currently underway in 2
communes, and a third will start soon.
A WHO rapid assessment team travelled to Abidjan last week and is working
with the Ministry of Health. In response to a request by the Ministry of
Health, WHO is helping to implement the urgent mass vaccination campaign
and providing additional technical and logistical assistance.
