Days after 8 peacocks were found dead in a sugarcane field in Uttar Pradesh's Bijnor, 9 peacocks have been found dead in Rajasthan's Alwar district on Thursday [21 Nov 2019]. According to officials, 5 more were found unconscious and the birds were being treated at a local veterinary hospital. Investigations to find the cause of the death of the peacocks are currently underway.

Authorities are trying to investigate if the peacocks had eaten anything poisonous or if they died due to some unknown disease.

Meanwhile, environmentalists said that the peacocks died because of the pesticides which were sprayed on the fields. Environmentalist Harshwardhan confirmed that the pesticides being sprayed in the fields were deadly for peacocks. If the use of the pesticides is not checked, more peacocks will die, he added.

The deaths have come at a time when thousands of migratory birds were recently found dead in and around Sambhar Lake in Rajasthan's Jaipur district.

[The peacock, _Pavo cristatus_, is a resident breeder across the Indian subcontinent. For a picture of a male and female peacock, go to https://media.buzzle.com/media/images-en/gallery/birds/peacock/1200-123612513-peacock-and-peahen.jpg.

Previous peacock die-offs in the Indian subcontinent were attributed to Newcastle disease. There is need of post mortem examination, lab tests, and other steps of a thorough outbreak investigation to be able to speculate possible causes of these deaths. - Mod.PMB
