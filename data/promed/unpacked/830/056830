Dr. Stuart Kenneth Hargreaves, BVSc 1946-2012
-----------------------------------------------
After a remarkable career with the Department of Veterinary Services (DVS) that spanned 41 years and which ended with his passing on 28 Aug 2012 in Harare, Dr. Stuart Hargreaves will be fondly remembered as a respected leader, skilled veterinarian, accomplished athlete, and proud Zimbabwean.

Drawing on years of experience spent in the field during the early part of his career, Dr. Hargreaves became a world-renowned expert in the management and control of foot and mouth disease (FMD). In the late 1970s, he was instrumental in controlling one of the most devastating outbreaks of FMD in Mashonaland in northern Zimbabwe. In the midst of his fieldwork, Dr. Hargreaves also helped establish a curriculum for the newly established Faculty of Veterinary Science at the University of Zimbabwe and, in 1983, was elevated to the position of Deputy Director in charge of all field services, responsible for a wide range of animal health activities relating to both livestock and wildlife. In 1990, he was appointed Director of Veterinary Services, responsible for directing all aspects of animal health, veterinary diagnostics, research, and veterinary public health. In 2002, the post of Principal Director, Livestock and Veterinary Services was created, which brought livestock production and veterinary services under one authority; Dr. Hargreaves held this position from its inception until his death.

Dr. Hargreaves was responsible for the management and control of all important livestock disease concerns in Zimbabwe. He effectively managed various departments within the Division of Livestock and Veterinary Services, including veterinary field and diagnostic services, veterinary public health, tsetse and trypanosomiasis control, and livestock production, and was for many years also involved in and responsible for wildlife health and disease control. He established an enduring and highly effective Veterinary Wildlife Unit, headed by Dr. Chris Foggin, and was involved in the design and establishment of the country's wildlife conservancies. Dr. Hargreaves spearheaded institutional reform and changes in legislation, promoted adoption of new management techniques that allowed Zimbabwe to export livestock and livestock products, championed the establishment of community-based animal health workers across Zimbabwe, and proposed innovative approaches to disease management such as commodity-based trade. He was instrumental in developing strong and lasting linkages between the public sector and all sectors of the livestock and wildlife industries. On the international front, Dr. Hargreaves was the President of the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) Regional Commission for Africa from 1995 to 1997 and was one of the 5 elected members of the OIE International Terrestrial Animal Health Standards Commission from 2000 onwards. He was also an OIE expert for the evaluation of veterinary services.

He published a number of journal articles, mainly on FMD, livestock and tick-borne diseases, undertook several high profile international consultancies, and produced several international conference papers. He was a member of many professional associations, councils, committees and boards in the fields of veterinary science, animal production and public health, and was the recipient of multiple awards including: the Zimbabwe Society for Animal Production Gold Medal Award for outstanding contribution to the livestock industry; the J. F. Kapnek Charitable Trust Award for exceptional managerial commitment to the Zimbabwe Veterinary Journal and contributions to the veterinary profession; the Commercial Farmers Union Farming Oscar for outstanding contribution to the livestock industry, and in particular ensuring continued beef exports; the Research Council of Zimbabwe Award for distinguished contribution in the agricultural sector in the service of Zimbabwe, and the World Organisation for Animal Health - OIE Meritorious Medal. Dr. Hargreaves' contributions to animal health management and the control of transboundary animal diseases are widely known and well recognized in Zimbabwe, regionally, and internationally.

In honour of his selfless and dedicated service to his country and his profession, Dr. Stuart Hargreaves was given a state funeral. He was declared a hero of the nation who "flew the Zimbabwe flag high ... and argued for clear measures that would not deny less-resourced nations from trading in meat products in the lucrative markets of Europe, Asia, and North America. His contribution to the agriculture sector in general, and to livestock development in particular, was immeasurable." He is survived by his wife, Shirley Anne and son, Ross.

[Briefly, after studying at the University of Natal, Stuart obtained his veterinary degree at Onderstepoort (South Africa) in 1970. Thereafter, he devoted his career to Zimbabwe's Ministry of Agriculture, initially as a field and provincial veterinary officer (1971-1983), Deputy Director (1983-1988) and Director (1988-2002) before being promoted to Principal Director Livestock and Veterinary Services (2002 to date). He died on 28 Aug 2012. He was widely respected; see:

Stuart was a bright light in a blighted country. I apologise for the late posting, but I only just became aware of his death. - Mod.MHJ]

[Stuart Hargreaves's departure is a huge loss to the veterinary profession. His ceaseless efforts, for decades, to protect animal health and keep the veterinary system functioning in Zimbabwe even during the harshest circumstances were admired by his colleagues internationally. He kept on performing in his characteristically assiduous and humble way without hesitation, no fireworks, no boasting, just hard and continuous work, with remarkable success. His health problems did not stop him; he is rightly getting the deserved admiration of all who even briefly knew him. - Mod.AS]
