Filariasis, Phillippines ­ background
-------------------------------------
645 232 cases of filariasis (all forms) were estimated during 1963 to 1996.

Wuchereria bancrofti:
---------------------
Bancroftian filariasis is endemic to southern
Luzon, Mindanao, Mindoro, Palawan, Samar, Leyte,
Sorsogon and Bohol. 43 of 63 provinces were
endemic in 1960; 45 of 77 provinces as of 1996 4;
290 municipalities as of 2001; 351 of 1566
municipalities as of 2003; 39 of 79 provinces as of 2004.

Cases have recently been registered in
Marinduque. Both forms of filariasis (W.
bancrofti and B. malayi) coexist in only 4
provinces: Davao Oriental, Palawan, Eastern and
Northern Samar 6 and Surigao del Sur.

In 1984, a million persons were considered at
risk for filariasis (both W. bancrofti and B.
malayi) in the Philippines; 23.5 million in 2002;
15 034 765 in 2006; 21,882,581 in 2007. Only 2
provinces (Marinduque and Sulu) were considered
'high prevalence' areas (>10 percent) as of 1993.
Filariasis in the Philippines is nocturnally periodic.

Prevalence surveys:
37 percent of males and 17 percent of females in
a village on Cataduanes (microfilaremia, 1978
publication), 13 percent in Bayanan and 3.4
percent in Manganan (Mindoro, microfilaremia, 2004 publication)

Vectors:
The local vectors are Anopheles minimus
flavirostris, Aedes poicilius, Culex
quinquefasciatus and Ochlerotatus (Finlaya) niveus.

Brugia malayi
-------------
Brugia malayi is endemic to southwestern Palawan,
Sulu, Agusan and Samar. Both forms of filariasis
(W. bancrofti and B. malayi) coexist in only 4
provinces: Davao Oriental, Palawan, Eastern Samar
and Surigao del Sur. Brugia malayi was 1st
confirmed in the Philippines in 1964 - in Palawan
(33.1 percent local prevalence at the time). 43
of 63 provinces were endemic for filariasis in
1960; 45 of 77 provinces as of 1996. In
1984, 20 million persons were considered at risk
for filariasis (both W. bancrofti and B. malayi) in the Philippines.

Vectors:
The local vectors are Mansonia uniformis,
Mansonia bonnea and Mansonia dives. Mansonia
dives is associated with both nocturnally
periodic and subperiodic microfilaremia patterns on Palawan.

Mass treatment with diethylcarbamazine and
albendazole was administered to 1 945 121 persons
during 2001. 9 881 124 persons received mass
treatment in 2005 ; 10 174 936 in 2006; 13 627 661 in 2007.
