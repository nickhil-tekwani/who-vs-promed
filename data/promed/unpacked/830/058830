Falciparum malaria in Kingston, Jamaica: Recommendations for Travelers
---------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recently
been in communication with the Ministry of Health of Jamaica and the
Pan American Health Organization. There are reports of 13 confirmed
cases of malaria in Jamaica, a country where malaria transmission
does not normally occur and for which CDC has not previously
recommended antimalarial prophylactic drugs for U.S. travelers. The
outbreak is believed to have started in late October 2006.
These 13 cases, 2 of which are in children, were confirmed in
residents of Jamaica; an additional malaria infection was confirmed
in a U.S. resident who traveled to the island from 29 Oct through 6
Nov 2006. Eleven of the cases occurred in 3 neighborhoods within the
city of Kingston, Jamaica; the other 2 cases were in Sydenham, St.
Catherine, a neighboring province. All 13 confirmed infections were
caused by _Plasmodium falciparum_.
Malaria is not considered endemic on the island of Jamaica. The
Ministry of Health in Jamaica has responded with heightened
surveillance for malaria cases, mosquito control measures
(larviciding and spraying), and education of the local population.
The Caribbean Epidemiology Center and the Pan American Health
Organization/World Health Organization are assisting the Ministry of
Health with these response measures.
Antimalarial Medication
----------------
As of 4 Dec 2006, CDC is recommending prophylactic antimalarial
medication for travelers who may stay overnight in Kingston, Jamaica,
only. Travelers to other areas of the island do not need to take an
antimalarial drug. This recommendation is expected to be temporary.
Travelers should periodically check the CDC Travelers' Health website
for updates.
Chloroquine, which is the recommended antimalarial chemoprophylaxis
drug for Jamaica, has a long history of use and safety and is well
tolerated by most people including children. People with an allergy
to chloroquine should discuss an alternative antimalarial drug with
their health-care provider. To learn more about chloroquine,
including dosing information, see Information for the Public:
Prescription Drugs for Malaria.

[Jamaica was certified free of malaria in 1966, but the vector,
_Anopheles albimanus_, probably still exists on the island. In the
CDC outbreak notice copied above, it is assumed that the _P.
falciparum_ malaria is fully sensitive to chloroquine. However, this
has to our knowledge not been tested. The outbreak must originate
from imported _P. falciparum_, and whether it is
chloroquine-sensitive or -resistant will depend on it origin.
Chloroquine resistance is for instance found in the southern parts of
Panama, Columbia and the Amazon basin, whereas _P. falciparum_
malaria in Haiti are susceptible to chloroquine. - Mod.EP]
