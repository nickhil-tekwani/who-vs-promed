Ukraine's State Service for Food Safety and Consumer Rights Protection in the past several days received confirmation of an African swine fever (ASF) outbreak recorded in Poltava and Cherkasy regions.

According to a posting on the website of the authority, pigs died in public joint-stock company Kaplyntsivske (Poltava region) and private enterprise Shulz (Cherkasy region). ASF was diagnosed during the examination of the selected samples of biological material of the pigs on [12 and 13 May 2017].

Measures are being taken to localize the disease on the site of the outbreak and prevent the spread of ASF pathogens.

The ASF virus is the causative agent of ASF. The virus causes a hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in pigs, but persistently infects its natural hosts, warthogs, bush pigs and soft ticks of the _Ornithodoros_ genus, without any visible symptoms. There is currently no vaccine against ASF.

[Ukraine has been extensively affected by ASF, starting 2012. Its authorities consider ASF in each of its provinces as a separate event. Hence, the 2 outbreaks described in the above media report have been separately reported to the OIE, belonging to separate, parallel reporting threads.

The initial case in the Poltava province started on 21 Oct 2015; the new outbreak, described above, has been reported to the OIE on 16 May 2017, in follow-up report No 19 (available, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=18942).

ASF's 1st outbreak in the Cherkasy province reportedly started on 5 Feb 2017, notified to the OIE on 9 Feb 2017 (see 20170212.4834453). This has been followed by the 2nd, current outbreak, reported to the OIE in follow-up report No 1, submitted 16 May 2017 (available, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=23798). - Mod.AS
