Three bacteria seem to be responsible for a disease that has killed most of the Caribbean's reef-building corals.

White band disease causes the outer layer of corals to turn white and peel off. First noticed in the 1970s, it has swept through the Caribbean's staghorn and elkhorn corals. Both are now critically endangered. They are the region's only branched corals, creating most of the complex habitat that animals like fish rely on, so their loss has depleted the entire ecosystem. "This disease has taken out the key ecosystem architects," says David Smith of the University of Essex in Colchester, UK.

Now some likely culprits for white band disease have been identified. Michael Sweet of the University of Derby in the UK and colleagues treated diseased corals with antibiotics and tracked whether they recovered. They also monitored changes in the microorganisms present. If an antibiotic killed a microbe, but the coral did not recover, that microbe was not responsible for the disease.

Three bacteria were consistently present in diseased corals, but not healthy ones: _Vibrio charchariae_ -- a long-suspected offender -- _Lactobacillus suebicus_ and an unidentified species of _Bacillus_. One or more seems to be responsible for white band disease. Other bacteria have been tentatively identified in earlier studies, and Smith says they might also trigger the disease. "The likelihood is that at different times, different bacteria cause an infection," he says.

The team also found that the tissue damage that gives the disease its name is caused by a single-celled organism called a ciliate. Killing the ciliate did not stop the disease, but it reduced the tissue damage, suggesting the ciliate was taking advantage of the bacterial infection.

Both the bacteria and the ciliate seem to be essential to create white band disease. "You wouldn't get a disease without the bacteria," says Sweet. "But without the ciliate, you get a different disease."

Could the discovery help save the staghorn and elkhorn corals? Possibly. "Getting this smoking gun really provides you with conservation options," says Smith. It might be possible to identify where the bacteria are coming from and target the site -- human activity, such as sewage dumping, may have boosted the bacteria, for example.

Tempting as it might be, we can't treat white band disease with antibiotics, at least not in the wild, says Smith. For one thing, there is already a global epidemic of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and spraying reefs with antibiotics would only make it worse. Also, corals are home to "good" bacteria and cannot survive without them. "Antibiotics could knock out the bacteria that are required by the coral," says Smith.

However, Sweet wants to try boosting the coral's good bacteria, which help it fight off infections. "We could dose it with the coral's natural microflora," he says, and see if that boosts the coral's immune response. He calls this approach "Yakult for coral".

"Coral diseases have been increasingly reported over the past few decades and are a major contributor to coral decline worldwide. The Caribbean, in particular, has been noted as a hotspot for coral disease, and the aptly named white syndromes have caused the decline of the dominant reef building corals throughout their range. White band disease (WBD) has been implicated in the dramatic loss of _Acropora cervicornis_ and _Acropora palmata_ since the 1970s, resulting in both species being listed as critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red list. The causal agent of WBD remains unknown, although recent studies based on challenge experiments with filtrate from infected hosts concluded that the disease is probably caused by bacteria. Here, we report an experiment using 4 different antibiotic treatments, targeting different members of the disease-associated microbial community. 2 antibiotics, ampicillin and paromomycin, arrested the disease completely, and by comparing with community shifts brought about by treatments that did not arrest the disease, we have identified the likely candidate causal agent or agents of WBD.

Our interpretation of the experimental treatments is that one or a combination of up to 3 specific bacterial types, detected consistently in diseased corals but not detectable in healthy corals, are likely causal agents of WBD. In addition, a histophagous ciliate (_Philaster lucinda_) identical to that found consistently in association with white syndrome in Indo-Pacific acroporas was also consistently detected in all WBD samples and absent in healthy coral. Treatment with metronidazole reduced it to below detection limits, but did not arrest the disease. However, the microscopic disease signs changed, suggesting a secondary role in disease causation for this ciliate. In future studies to identify a causal agent of WBD via tests of Henle-Koch's postulates, it will be vital to experimentally control for populations of the other potential pathogens identified in this study."

In the Caribbean, corals suffer 3 common diseases Caribbean coral diseases, yellow-band disease, dark-spot syndrome, and white-plague (band) disease. Recent modelling work suggested that these diseases do not follow a contagious-disease model. Coral diseases may have multiple interacting causes. Coral reefs worldwide are threatened by increasing anthropogenic stressors, particularly overfishing and the problems associated with global climate change. Coral disease is recognized as another problem causing the degradation of reefs, which is demonstrated by a global increase in the numbers of coral diseases, coral species affected and disease outbreaks. The hypothesis that most closely matches the data is that environmental thresholds are exceeded, and then these environmental conditions either weaken the corals, which are then more susceptible to infection, or the conditions increase the virulence or abundance of pathogens. Exceeding such environmental thresholds will most likely become increasingly common in rapidly warming oceans, leading to more frequent coral-disease outbreaks, where diverse components of the parasite community will be implicated.
