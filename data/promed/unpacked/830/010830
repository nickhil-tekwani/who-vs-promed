Abstract
--------
Background
Pneumonia caused by adenovirus infection is usually severe especially
with adenovirus type 7 [which is] commonly associated with lower
respiratory tract disease outbreaks. We report an outbreak of 70
cases of severe pneumonia with one death of infants in Shaanxi
Province, China. Sampling showed adenovirus 7 (Ad7) as the primary
pathogen with some co-infections.

Results
Two strains of adenovirus and 2 strains of enterovirus were isolated,
the 21 pharyngeal swabs showed 16 positive amplifications for
adenovirus; 3 co-infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 2
with rhinovirus, one with parainfluenza virus type 3, and 4 [?]
negative. Adenovirus typing showed 9 of the 16 adenovirus positive
samples were human adenovirus type 7 (HAdV-7), 3 were HAdV-3 and 4
were too weak to perform sequencing.

The entire hexon gene of adenovirus was sequenced and analyzed for
the 2 adenovirus type 7 isolates, showing the nucleic acid homology
was 99.8 percent between the 2 strains and 99.5 percent compared to
the reference strain HAdV-7 (GenBank accession number AY769946). For
the 21 acute phase serum samples from the 21 patients, 6 samples had
positives and 3 suspension positive results for ELISA detection of
HAdV IgA, and the neutralization titers of the convalescent-phase
samples were 4 times higher than those of the acute-phase samples in 9 pairs.

Conclusion
We concluded adenovirus was the viral pathogen, primarily HAdV-7,
with some co-infections responsible for the outbreak. This is the 1st
report of an infant pneumonia outbreak caused by adenovirus 7 in
Shaanxi Province, China.

[Adenovirus types 3, 7, and 21 have been responsible for most
outbreaks of serious (lower) respiratory tract infection in children.
In the current outbreak in Shaanxi Province in China adenovirus types
7 and 3 have been identified as the principal pathogens. The presence
of co-infecting RSV, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza virus type 3 may
have exacerbated the disease process non-specifically.
