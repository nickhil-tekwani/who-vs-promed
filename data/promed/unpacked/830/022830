The 9-year-old boy, originally from Farmington, New Mexico, has [a] hantavirus [infection]. It started with flu-like symptoms, but within days was being airlifted to Children's Hospital in Aurora [Colorado] in critical condition. Hantavirus [infection] is a deadly disease usually carried by deer mice, and spread through contact with rodent feces [urine and saliva - Mod.TY].

"Basically it's a killer disease. If you do contact [a] hantavirus there is no cure or medicine for it," the boy's father, GH, told Denver7.

GH says his son woke up one morning in January [2018] throwing up. The next day it had gotten worse so he took him to the emergency room. The boy was eventually sent home with oxygen to help his breathing. Days later his condition became life-threatening and he was airlifted to Children's Hospital in Aurora for treatment on [10 Feb 2018].

The boy has been in the hospital since, in and out of a medically-induced coma. He is currently on life support. "He's awake, he responds by nodding, he can kind of speak, and he's trying. It's just really heartbreaking to see him in bed," his father said.

GH says he doesn't know how his son contracted the virus, though they do live in a farming community where mice are prevalent.

Hantavirus [infection] is extremely rare; there are less than 50 cases each year in the United States. It is deadly in about 1 third of all cases.

"His lungs are destroyed - more than 80 percent - and doctors are trying to see if they can get them going. If that doesn't work, maybe a lung transplant but that's a big maybe, doctors say," GH said. His family is now waiting, hoping for the best.

[This is a follow-up on this case that was posted on 2 Mar 2018 (see ProMED-mail archive Hantavirus - Americas (17): USA (NM) 20180304.5664080). That report mentioned that this appears to be the 2nd case of the virus reported in the Farmington area in one month. The 1st case, a 27 year old, was still at the University of New Mexico Hospital fighting for her life after doctors say she tested positive for the virus in January [2018]. Unfortunately, the boy above remains in critical condition in the Aurora Colorado hospital.

Over the years, New Mexico has had a large proportion of the cases of Sin Nombre virus infections. The basis on which a hantavirus infection diagnosis was made is probably clinical and no mention is made of laboratory results that would confirm the etiology. The hantavirus involved in this current New Mexico case above and other cases in the western USA is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS), which the boy suffers. HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html.

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the Sin Nombre virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg and in the report at the above URL. - Mod.TY
