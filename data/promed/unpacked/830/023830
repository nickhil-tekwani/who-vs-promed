Toronto is in the grip of the worst whooping cough outbreak to hit
the city in at least a dozen years, public health authorities
confirmed yesterday, 8 Feb 2006.
"We're seeing about a 5-fold increase in the number of cases being
reported to us," said Rita Shahin, a doctor with Toronto Public
Health.
Toronto has recorded 164 cases of the highly contagious disease since
1 Nov 2005, nearly as many as it logged in all of 2003, 2004 and the
rest of 2005 combined. 31 cases were reported in 2003, 88 in 2004 and
62 in the first 10 months of 2005.
Of the past 12 years, only 1994 saw more than 164 cases of whooping
cough. There were 172 cases that year -- 8 more in 12 months than
Toronto has logged in 3 months this winter.
Most of those diagnosed have been children under the age of 4, making
the mini-epidemic a tough challenge for city daycares. "Dealing with
this has been a full-time job since we got back from the holidays,"
said preschool supervisor Georgia Bowen. The supervisor at the
Creative Preschool of East Toronto on St. Matthews Road said that in
her 27 years in the daycare business, she had never seen an outbreak
of whooping cough like the one that has torn through her Riverdale
preschool this winter.
Since Dec 2005, 9 children have tested positive for the respiratory
illness; as of 25 Jan 2006 all 104 of her tiny charges were either on
antibiotics to prevent the spread of the disease or, if their parents
objected to that, barred from the preschool for 21 days.
Miriam Mifshud of Ms. Miriam's Nursery School and Play Centre on
Danforth Avenue also said she was "absolutely stunned" by the 7 cases
diagnosed at her daycare this winter. "In 3 or 4 decades of
teaching, I just haven't seen this," she said. At both Creative
Preschool and Ms. Miriam's, every child had been vaccinated.
Dr. Shahin said it is difficult to pinpoint what caused the unusual
spike in pertussis, commonly called the whooping cough because of the
high-pitched wheezing noise sufferers make at the end of its
characteristic prolonged coughing fits.
"A lot of the infectious diseases tend to peak certain years and then
go back down again, and we don't really know what the cause is," said
Dr. Shahin. "Sometimes it may be that the vaccine might be a little
less effective."
Dr. Shahin said the public health authority is reviewing all 164
cases to determine if all those afflicted had received the full 5
doses of the whooping cough vaccine, 4 of which should be given
before a child is 18 months old. "Maybe some of them weren't
immunized completely," Dr. Shahin said. The outbreak appears to be
limited to Toronto.
"We're aware of the Toronto outbreak, but we haven't heard of any
others elsewhere in Canada," said Michael Tansey, a spokesman for the
Public Health Agency of Canada.
Of the 164 Torontonians diagnosed in the past 3 months, 44 were
children younger than 1, 90 were children between the ages of 1 and
4, and the rest were older than 4. While cases have popped up all
over the city, there is a large concentration in its eastern and
southern portions.
Most of the children infected in Toronto have displayed only mild
symptoms akin to a cough or cold, Dr. Shahin said. Still, for
affected parents, the outbreak has caused concern and headaches.

[The reason for this impressive cluster of cases of pertussis in
Ontario is as yet unclear, but at least some of the cases occurred in
fully immunized children. It is not stated in the posting what the
range of symptoms were and how many of the cases were diagnosed
solely on culture with no or little illness. Indeed, the effect of
immunization on the overall carriage rate of _Bordetella pertussis_
in the population (<http://www.who.int/vaccines/en/pertussis.shtml>)
may be summarized as "the possible effect of the respective vaccines
on pharyngeal colonization of _B. pertussis_ and on mild pertussis
among adolescents and adults needs to be better established."
If the affected cohort as a whole had been adequately immunized, it
is possible that a strain of the organism has developed that may be
escaping the vaccine-induced immunity, but no clear data support this
supposition.
However, it is clear that immunity to pertussis wanes with time.
This is true in both the older whole cell killed vaccine and the
newer acellular toxoid product (which is less reactogenic but no more
immunogenic). Susceptibility increases during adolescent years with
the production of infectious cases with "non-whoop" pertussis
manifesting as a chronic cough.
To deal with infected adolescents functioning as a reservoir to
unimmunized children, the following are the newest recommendations
for the expanded use of pertussis vaccine in adolescents in the USA
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5451-Immunizationa1.htm>:
"A new tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular
pertussis vaccine for adolescents (Tdap adolescent preparation [a
small letter is used for diphtheria and pertussis in this product,
since the amount of antigen is lower than the pediatric formulation -
Mod.LL]) was approved by the USA FDA on 5 May 2005, for use in the
USA. Tdap is recommended for adolescents aged 11-12 years who have
completed the recommended childhood diphtheria and tetanus toxoids
and pertussis/diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertusis
(DTP/DTaP) vaccination series and have not received a tetanus and
diphtheria toxoids (Td) booster dose. Adolescents aged 13 -18 years
who missed the age 11-12-year Td/Tdap booster dose should also
receive a single dose of Tdap if they have completed the recommended
childhood DTP/DTaP vaccination series. Subsequent Td boosters are
recommended every 10 years. In the future, acellular pertussis
immunization may be used in adults as well."
In assessing the durability of pertussis vaccination in children,
some researchers noted that "Reported cases and outbreaks in older
children and young adults may reflect a less durable vaccine-induced
protection than seen in natural disease (Cherry JD, Brunell PA,
Golden GA., Karzon, DT: Report of the Task Force on Pertussis and
Pertussis Immunization - 1988, Pediatrics, 1988; 81 (June Suppl):
955). The duration of protection has varied in several studies,
depending on the epidemiological setting, i.e., prevalence of natural
disease as well as the vaccine product used. A study in Michigan
showed an efficacy of 80 percent 3 years after the last dose, 50
percent between 4 and 7 years, and virtually none after 12 years.
Breakthrough disease noted in this study was usually mild."
