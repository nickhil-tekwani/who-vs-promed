Report on the Working Group meeting on bovine tuberculosis
----------------------------------------------------------
Following the extraordinary Standing Committee for Food Chain and
Animal Health (SCFCAH) [meeting] of 23 Jul 2008 where the findings of
bovine tuberculosis (TB) in young calves introduced from the United
Kingdom into the Netherlands via intra-Community trade were
discussed, on 2 Sep 2008, a Working Group of experts on bovine
tuberculosis was organised.

The Commission invited representatives of all Member States and 6
private experts (Director of the Community reference laboratory on
tuberculosis and 5 members of the Task Force Sub-group on bovine
tuberculosis).

Objective of the meeting
------------------------
The purpose of the meeting was to explore with the Member States
measures to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis [TB] from areas
with high prevalence of the disease via intra-Community trade in live
cattle, and in particular calves under 42 days of age that are
statutory not subject to pre-movement testing.

Background
----------
In July 2008, the Netherlands (officially bovine tuberculosis-free
Member State), based on the epidemiological investigation followed by
the notification received from the United Kingdom, detected a number
of cases of infection with _Mycobacterium bovis_ in calves under 42
days of age coming from a single holding in the United Kingdom, that
went down with tuberculosis after the dispatch of the animals.

Dutch and Belgian farmers have self imposed a ban on British cattle
following the revelation that 12 veal calves were positive for bovine
tuberculosis. The Dutch Agriculture Ministry has condemned this
breech of biosecurity, particularly as there has been no TB in the
Netherlands since 1999.

Due to the arisen situation, on 23 Jul 2008 the Commission organised
an extraordinary SCFCAH meeting in order to clarify the TB situation
in the UK and exchange opinion with the Member States on the measures
to be taken in that respect.

During the meeting the Member States agreed that at this point in
time immediate additional Community measures are not needed. The UK
agreed to reinforce the controls on such movements, to ensure that
Directive 64/432/EEC is fully applied, and that relevant information
is transmitted to Member States of destination without delay.

Member States engaged themselves to monitor the situation and to
inform the Commission in case of new findings.

Moreover, the Commission committed itself to set up in the 1st days
of September 2008 an expert meeting to further discuss the issue and
possible Community-wide measures.

General discussion and issues raised by the participants
--------------------------------------------------------
The Netherlands presented the situation and the measures taken due to
the detection of TB positive calves below 6 weeks of age introduced
via intra-Community trade to the officially TB free bovine herds at
their territory.

The United Kingdom updated the participants on the current situation
as regards bovine tuberculosis on the territory of their country and
on measures taken in relation to the breakdown in an officially
tuberculosis-free herd of origin of the calves, found later TB
positive in the Netherlands. The UK emphasised that this isolated
incident was due to a case of bovine tuberculosis mastitis.

Certain Member States and in particular the Netherlands urged that
action be taken at all levels and especially by the Member States not
yet officially bovine tuberculosis-free to ensure that eradication of
the disease is accelerated.

The Commission gave a brief overview of the Community legislation on
bovine tuberculosis noting that calves under 42 days of age are
exempted for the requirement of the pre-movement testing and that in
this case, current EU provisions rely only on the status of the herd.
In addition, the Commission presented for discussion 4 possible
alternative provisions which could be implemented, either one at a
time or in combination, in order to prevent the spread of TB from
areas with high prevalence of the disease via intra-Community trade
in calves under 42 days of age, and in particular apart from the
mandatory officially tuberculosis-free herd origin:

1. Pre-movement test (intradermal skin test or gamma interferon test)
of individual animals concerned;
2. Low prevalence region origin (below 1 or 0,5 percent or other);
3. Recent herd test (such as, less then 6 months) with strictly
defined frequency of testing the herd (annual, twice a year, etc.);
4. Channelling procedure (post-movement test at destination or
dispatched to a holding at destination from which they can only be
moved directly to a slaughterhouse).

Conclusions
-----------
There was general consensus on:
- the need to ensure that the officially bovine tuberculosis-free (TB
OF) status is properly granted to the herds, as this is the basic
requirement in order to ensure safe trade;
- the pre-movement testing is not suitable for animals younger than
42 days of age due to the lack of sensitivity of the test when used
on these animals;
- there is a need to have proportionate and effective measures in
order to address the risk posed by these animals that cannot be
tested before movement.

An acceptable regime for animals below 42 days of age would be as follows:
Bovine animals for breeding and production less than 42 days old
shall only be dispatched to other Member States if they come from an
officially tuberculosis-free bovine herd as defined in Article
2(2)(d) of Directive 64/432/EEC, and:

1. The holding of origin is situated in a Member State or a region of
a Member State as defined in Article 2(2)(p) of Directive 64/432/EEC
in which on average, determined at 31 December of each year, the
annual percentages of bovine herds confirmed as infected with
tuberculosis is not more than 0.5 percent of all herds within the
Member State or region thereof, or
2. All animals in the holding of origin, with the exception of
animals under 6 weeks old, have been subjected with negative results
to the routine intradermal tuberculin test in accordance with Annex B
to Directive 64/432/EEC at an interval of more than 3 months and less
than 6 months during the last 12 months, or
3. All animals in the holding of origin, with the exception of
animals under 6 weeks old, have been subjected with negative results
to the intradermal tuberculin test in accordance with Annex B to
Directive 64/432/EEC, carried out in the 30 days prior to the
movement, or
4. The animals are consigned, through a channelling procedure under
the control of the competent authority of the place of destination,
to a holding from where they can only be removed:
a. to be transported directly to the slaughterhouse for slaughter in
accordance with the first indent of Article 7 of Directive
64/432/EEC, or
b. to be introduced not earlier than at the age of at least 42 days
into another herd in accordance with the procedure provided for in
point 1(c) of Section I of Annex A to Directive 64/432/EEC [see
commentary. - Mod.AS]

On 3 Sep 2008 the conclusions of the meeting were presented to the
Standing Committee for Food Chain and Animal Health under point 4D of
the Committee's agenda.

[Directive 64/432/EEC, point C of section I in Annex A says: "no
bovine animal has been introduced without a certificate from an
official veterinarian showing that the animal has reacted negatively
to an intradermal tuberculin test assessed according to the criteria
set out in Annex B 21 (a) and that it comes from an officially
tuberculosis-free herd".

Article 21 (a) of Annex B says: "the result of the intradermal
tuberculin test must be read after 72 hours and assessed according to
the following method: (a) negative reaction: if only limited swelling
is observed, with an increase of not more than 2 mm in the thickness
of the fold of skin without clinical signs such as pasty consistency,
exudation, necrosis, pain or inflammation of the lymphatic ducts in
that region and of the lymph nodes. - Mod.AS]
