-------------------
Information received on 9 Dec 2013 from Dr Christianne Bruschke, chief veterinary officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, The Hague, Netherlands

Summary
Report type: Follow-up report No. 1 (Final report)
Date of start of the event: 10 Oct 2013
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 19 Oct 2013
Report date: 8 Dec 2013
Date submitted to OIE: 9 Dec 2013
Date event resolved: 8 Dec 2013
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: August 2012
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Rabies virus
Serotype: RABV
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

Outbreaks: There are no new outbreaks in this report.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: introduction of new live animals.

Epidemiological comment: At the National Reference Laboratory (NRL), the immunofluorescence tests (IFT) of both dogs were positive; however, they were not confirmed by the PCR and virus isolation tests. For this reason, the OIE and European Rabies Reference Laboratory (AFSSA, French Agency for Food Safety) have tested the samples again by IFT, PCR, and rabies tissue culture infection tests. The results of these tests were all negative. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that the presence of rabies virus was not detected and that the IFT at the NRL was a false positive. The cases were finally declared rabies negative. Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: Since the diagnosis has not been finally confirmed, this follow-up report and its immediate notification will remain for 2 weeks so to make these negative results known by the maximum of persons, and then they will be deleted.

Control measures
Measures applied: no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Future reporting
This event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.
