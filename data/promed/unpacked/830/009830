The chikungunya virus outbreak continues to spread in French Polynesia. The latest report by the health authorities published on [Mon 1 Dec 2014], noted that 18 352 people had consulted a physician for the chikungunya virus since the beginning of the outbreak that started on the 2nd week of October [2014].

But the epidemic peak has not been reached yet according to the health authorities, and about 30 new cases are reported each day. 94 per cent of these cases are reported in Tahiti and Moorea. In both islands, (medical) consultations are increasing each week, with up to 6 000 in Tahiti last week [week of 24 Nov 2014] (40 000 nationwide).

Throughout the archipelago
--------------------------
The weekly report noted a significant increase of the outbreak in the Leeward Islands reaching level 4 -- the most important -- indicating that the virus is now in circulation throughout the Polynesian archipelago.

As a reminder, the number of deaths related to the outbreak was raised to 4 by the health authorities last week [week of 24 Nov 2014]. Among the deceased were an 80-year-old-man and an 8-day-old-infant. The latest report also noted 159 hospitalizations of over 24 hours, 35 per cent of them were pregnant women.

On Rapa Nui and in the Caribbean
--------------------------------
A case of chikungunya virus was reported on Easter Island on [18 Nov 2014]. According to "Polynesie 1ere", Rapa Nui has since reported 3 suspected indigenous cases.

In the American Caribbean islands, where the outbreak began in St Martin and reached Florida [USA] and Mexico, health officials reported that nearly 900 000 evocative cases of the virus had spread across 40 territories.

[The number of chikungunya virus infections in this outbreak in French Polynesia continues to climb rapidly with 30 new cases each day. Since the detection of the 1st cases on 10 Oct 2014, the virus has spread to several islands in French Polynesia, and the case number has now climbed from an estimated 5000 with 2 deaths on 19 Nov 2014, to 18 352, with 4 deaths cited above.

In the absence of a commercially available vaccine, vector control is the only preventive measure available, which is the reason for the spraying campaign. Health authorities and the general public need to engage in a collaborative effort to eliminate vector mosquito breeding sites.
