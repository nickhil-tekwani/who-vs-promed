A shortage of yellow fever vaccine at City Hall since October [2019] has disrupted plans of many Kenyans seeking to travel abroad.

A spot check by the Business Daily since [Mon 27 Jan 2020] showed that dozens of Kenyans were being turned away and forced to pay more to get the jab at airports.

A nurse at the Nairobi County's inoculation centre, who sought anonymity, said the last time City Hall had supplies for the vaccine was in late October [2019], adding that they had not received any fresh stocks despite making requisitions to health authorities.

City Hall charges Sh 3000 [USD 29.85], up from the previous Sh 2500 [USD 24.88], for the vaccine that is mandatory for all people seeking to travel to countries that are considered to be vulnerable to yellow fever. The same dose goes for USD 50 or about Sh 5043 at the airports.

Kenya is one of the eastern, central, western and southern African countries the World Health Organisation considers to be prone to the disease, making the yellow fever vaccine a must-have for any traveller to or from these nations.

[It is not clear why the yellow fever (YF) vaccine shortage exists. The shortage and higher than previous prices run the risk of driving vaccination efforts underground, administration of fake vaccine, sale of fake vaccination certificates or issuance of the certificates without vaccination. These practices have been a problem in the past. Not only would these illegal practices pose a risk to the individuals who might be exposed to YF virus and be unprotected, there is a risk to the general public should a viremic individual introduce the virus into an area where the vector mosquitoes are abundant enough to permit ongoing transmission of the virus. This also damages public confidence in health officials in general. Fortunately, the governor has been aware of these practices, has taken steps to inform the public, and instructing the police to investigate and prosecute the offenders. Close monitoring of the current vaccine situation by Kenya health authorities would be prudent. - Mod.TY
