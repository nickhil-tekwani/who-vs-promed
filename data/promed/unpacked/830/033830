At the end of December 2020, a child from the northern district was diagnosed with tuberculosis. The child is symptom-free but receiving medical treatment. The diagnosis was made after a cattle herd tested positive for the bacterium and the veterinary office passed on this information to the Health Department. Because of the large number of infected animals, all cattle in the herd were killed as a precaution and disposed of.

The farm has officially been put under restrictions following the initial confirmation of the disease; neither meat nor milk was supplied to the food chain.

In the course of the family's investigation, 2 persons tested positive and are undergoing medical treatment.

In case of tuberculosis, persons who accumulated more than 40 contact hours with the patient are considered exposed; this has been conveyed to the child's secondary school in Geretsried. On Monday [18 Jan 2021] evening, all parents of exposed classmates and their teachers shared a video conference with health officials, during which questions could be addressed. The exposed persons will undergo testing and a follow-up. Such measures are not required in other classes of the school.

Bovine tuberculosis is very rare in our region. Germany is officially free from bovine tuberculosis; it is so far unknown how the pathogen was introduced into the herd. Transmission from cattle to humans is also very unusual. A transfer from animal to animal, however, is quite possible.

People react very differently to the bacterium; in the majority of cases, there is no clinical expression of the disease. Usually it takes a long time for the disease to become active. It becomes contagious when, as in the current case, it is active, clinically obvious tuberculosis. Diagnosis in humans is made by the examination of sputum that is excreted when coughing. When the child's sputum was examined, the bacterium could not be seen by a direct microscopic examination, and culturing was required. This is interpreted as a case with low infectivity.

[Bad Tolz-Wolfratshausen is a district in the German state of Bavaria (map at https://tinyurl.com/yy9nx5cz). The city Geretsried is located about 30 km (18.6 mi) north of the Austrian border.

A previous tuberculosis event affecting cattle in Bavaria was caused by _Mycobacterium caprae_. It took place in a location distant from the current one, in Upper Allgaeu (Oberallgaeu), southwestern Bavaria, bordering the Austrian Tyrol on its south -- where _M. caprae_ is known to circulate in deer (20130317.1590824).

Details of the outbreak in Bavarian cattle, which reportedly was the source of the child's infection, including its origin and final results of the laboratory tests addressing both (human and bovine) events, are anticipated.

In central Europe, _M. caprae_ has been identified as a common cause of bovine tuberculosis. Disease caused by _M. caprae_ is not considered to be substantially different from that caused by _M. bovis_, and the same tests can be used for its diagnosis. - Mod.AS
