Group B rotaviruses have been identified virtually worldwide, wherever
intense evaluation of samples has occurred. The large
outbreaks/epidemics of the 1980s were confined to the People's Republic
of China.
Evaluation of the epidemic pattern suggested animal to human
transmission followed by person to person transmission. Morbidity was
severe, with, as I remember, about 7% of affected adults presenting in
shock. Outside of these recognized outbreaks, cases have been sporadic,
representing
limitations on spread that are not understood, suggesting non-human
reservoirs, the most likely perhaps being domestic/agricultural animals.
Animal reservoirs also may be very important factors in the epidemiology
of human illness caused by Group A and group C rotaviruses. For
example, many of the group A rotavirus serotypes have been recovered
from both human and non-human sources. Group C rotavirus epidemiology in
humans
is similar to that of group B rotaviruses, however, large epidemics have
not been recognized.
