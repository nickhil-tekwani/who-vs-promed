[This report is being posted to recognise the Kyrgyz efficient efforts and to encourage other countries, faced with a similar emergence of anthrax, to take the threat seriously. Other than the proper and quick disposal of anthrax carcasses, the most cost-effective and beneficial action to take to control this disease is to get the livestock vaccinated.in and around where the cases have occurred. It works well, and if continued for 5-6 years can result in a local eradication. - Mod.MHJ
