Citrus canker, northward intrusion - USA (Florida) 20011012.2502

[The following is a reply from Tim Schubert, Florida Dept of Agriculture &
Consumer Services, Division of Plant Industry, Gainesville, FL, to whom I
had posed the following questions: What is the significance of the outbreak
of citrus canker north of the Palm Beach County line? Is "northern Florida"
where the bulk of the commercial citrus groves are located? - Mod.DH
The following is his reply:
These 2 latest finds are certainly disappointing developments in the
efforts to eradicate citrus canker in Florida, but the goal is still
achievable. In instances where the authorities have been allowed to [remove
all trees within 1900 feet of infected trees as soon as possible after
discovery, the disease virtually disappears. Legal entanglements revolving
around the state and federal government's authority to inspect suspect
citrus and remove infected and exposed citrus on private residential
property are preventing progress to our goal of eradication.
Cooperation, once canker is discovered in the commercial citrus production
arena, has been good. Canker simply can not be left alone in residential
citrus without posing extreme risks to commercial citriculture.
These 2 finds constitute invasion into new territory (eastward from the
previously infected Manatee area and northward from the largest canker
stronghold in Dade and Broward Counties), territory which is closer to or
actually on the edges of what many consider to be the heart of the Florida
citrus industry. The find in Martin Co. in grapefruit (extremely
susceptible) and Valencia (more resistant) has strong circumstantial
connections (same owners and equipment) with a grove that was found to have
canker in extreme eastern Hendry Co. back in November, 2000.
The De Soto Co. grove near Arcadia is only 4 yrs old. The normally more
canker-resistant Valencia variety being grown there was "pushed" so hard
horticulturally with fertilizer and water that the infection was
progressing quite rapidly on the ample new growth. Here, circumstantial
evidence points to spot-picking of the first sparse crop in April of 2000
as the likely means of introduction of the pathogen into the grove.
Thorough decontamination of equipment and personnel cannot be overemphasized!
As to the location of the major citrus production area(s) of FL, it would
be misleading to state that it is in "north Florida." There are actually
several major production areas: Indian River / Atlantic coast area (Palm
Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River, Brevard and Volusia counties),
Central Ridge (Polk, Hardee, De Soto, Highlands, Okeechobee, Osceola,
Orange, Seminole and Lake counties), Southwest FL (Collier, Hendry, Lee,
Charlotte and Glades counties), and Gulf Coast (Manatee, Hillsborough,
Sarasota and Pasco counties).
The counties that now have or have had canker since 1995 are Manatee,
Hillsborough, Sarasota, Collier, Hendry, Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach
counties, with the recent addition of De Soto and Martin Counties. No
canker has been detected in Manatee county for well over a year;
Hillsborough county's last detection was 20 month ago."

[My thanks to Tim for this useful update on citrus canker. I apologize to
our readers for mistakenly assuming that the bulk of citrus production is
in "northern Florida". - Mod.DH
