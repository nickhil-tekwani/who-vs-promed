1st confirmed case of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in Switzerland
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In Apr 2005, a 31-year-old man in Geneva presented with anorectal
syndrome (rectal pain and bloody stools) and diarrhea which had been
occurring at least 3-4 times per day for 2 weeks. He reported having
unprotected anal intercourse with a man in Berlin approximately 6
weeks prior to symptom onset. Endoscopic examination of the colon
revealed inflammation of the distal third of the rectum with areas of
small superficial erosions and one large erosion covered with fibrin.
Microbiological analysis of a rectal biopsy using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) showed the presence of _Chlamydia trachomatis_. A
molecular technique confirmed the case as L2 genotype [1]. High
titres of _C. trachomatis_ IgG (1280) and IgA (160) were observed
using immunofluorescence assay. Tests for syphilis, HIV, and
gonorrhea were all negative. The patient was treated with doxycycline
100 mg twice daily for 3 weeks. After this, symptoms were had
decreased but not resolved, and so he was given a 2nd antibiotic
treatment of erythromycin 500 mg 4 times daily for 3 weeks. The
patient improved after this treatment. Proctoscopic examination was
repeated 3 weeks after the end of treatment and showed normal
macroscopic rectal mucosa. Repeat PCR in a rectal specimen also
showed the absence of _C. trachomatis_ at this stage.
This is the 1st confirmed case of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) in
Switzerland [2]. 2 previously suspected cases (PCR of _C.
trachomatis_ positive in rectal specimens) were diagnosed in Geneva
in Feb and Apr 2004. The lack of diagnostic facilities in Switzerland
prevented an adequate diagnosis. Recently, an increase of sexually
transmitted infections (STI), particularly syphilis and _Neisseria
gonorrhoeae_ infections, has been reported in Switzerland, especially
in Geneva and Zurich [3]. LGV's emergence in Switzerland following
the reports of LGV in men who have sex with men (MSM) in different
European cities is not surprising. LGV is probably underdiagnosed in
Switzerland at present.
Outbreaks of LGV in MSM have been reported since 2004 in Europe [4,5]
and the United States and Canada [6,7]. It is crucial to inform
medical workers and high-risk populations of this new STI so that
patients can be treated rapidly and appropriately, and dissemination
of the disease avoided [12].
Enhanced surveillance programmes are now being implemented in France,
the United Kingdom and the Netherlands [1,5,8]. Diagnostic tests
specific for LGV are urgently needed.
