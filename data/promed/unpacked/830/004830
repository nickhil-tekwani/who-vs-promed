[3] UK, USA: cases

Both the United Kingdom -- the 1st epicenter of the monkeypox outbreak -- and the United States -- home to the largest case count -- have released new technical reports that show monkeypox cases are declining.

In the United States, the doubling time for the outbreak has stretched to 25 days, from an average of 8 days throughout July [2022].

The reports come as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) highlights cases involving atypical symptoms and false-positive tests, indicating monkeypox when the patients did not have the disease.

In Britain, new cases are falling steadily, which the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said may be due to several factors, but not solely the national vaccination strategy. Instead, the UKHSA said the decline could be due to behavior changes, proper diagnosis, and saturation of the at-risk population.

"It is likely that some combination of these 3 factors has contributed so far, and vaccines will play a larger role in coming weeks," the UKHSA said in the report.

Only 43 UK women been infected with the virus, with 99% of confirmed cases occurring in men. A total of 3239 cases have been recorded in the country, with 70% of patients in England residing in London.

In the United States, the CDC said cases are slowing in early outbreak hot spots, such as New York City, but growing exponentially in Indiana, Virginia, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia.

"We note daily cases are declining in several large US states and European countries and that our growth rate estimates are based on trends observed through mid-August [2022], so the outbreak growth rate could slow further in the coming weeks," the CDC report said. "Because the causes of cases slowing in the United States and other countries are not well understood and patterns have not been uniform, we cannot predict the timing and precise trajectory of case declines in the United States."

The CDC said the average age of US patients is 35, with 7 pediatric cases (under 18 years) confirmed. Several other cases in children ages 12 to 17 are under investigation.

Men still make up 98.2% of cases, with only 164 cases (1.8%) recorded in women. Race and ethnicity data show roughly one-third of cases have occurred, respectively, in White, Hispanic, and Black populations.

Men who have sex with men are still by far the most affected group. "Among 4460 cases with known sexual orientation and gender, 4159 (93.3%) were gay or bisexual men, 242 (5.4%) were straight or heterosexual men, and 59 (1.3%) were straight, lesbian, or bisexual women," the CDC wrote.

[4] Test challenges
Date: Fri 2 Sep 2022

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7136e1.htm


Citation: Minhaj FS, Petras JK, Brown JA, et al. _Orthopoxvirus_ testing challenges for persons in populations at low risk or without known epidemiologic link to monkeypox -- United States, 2022. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2022.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
------
What is already known about this topic?
Testing for _Monkeypox virus_, using Food and Drug Administration 510(k)-cleared non-variola _Orthopoxvirus_ real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and laboratory developed real-time PCR tests, is critical for diagnosis of suspected cases.

What is added by this report?
There were 3 persons with atypical rashes, uncharacteristic illnesses, and absence of risk factors or an epidemiologic link to a known monkeypox case [who] received false-positive real-time PCR test results; late cycle threshold values were all ≥34.

What are the implications for public health practice?
When testing specimens from patients with atypical signs and symptoms or without epidemiologic links or risk factors or where these are unknown, laboratories should reextract and retest specimens with real-time PCR Ct values that are high (≥34) to avoid unnecessary medical treatment and expenditure of public health resources.

[Reliable tests results are essential clinically for providing timely treatment and epidemiologically to determine when and where cases are occurring. False-positive results complicate both of these goals. - Mod.TY]

[5] Monkeypox and syphilis coinfection
Date: Fri 23 Aug 2022

Citation: Vives A, Vantman D, Rocco M, et al. Coinfection of monkeypox, COVID-19 and syphilis in a PrEP using MSM: a case report from Barcelona [preprint]. 2022; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1960471/v1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is a zoonotic disease, with endemic circulation and it is not considered a sexually transmitted infection. Recently, it has been reported in a particularly high incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM). We report the 1st case of a male HIV-negative patient with HIV pre-exposition prophylaxis (PrEP), and a simultaneous coinfection of monkeypox virus, COVID-19 and syphilis.

[Conclusion]
------------
This is the 1st case report of [syphilis], COVID-19 and monkeypox coinfection in an HIV-negative MSM using PrEP. It is important to mention that the diagnosis wasn't easy since the infected ulcer in the penis (chancre) was misleading and because we had never seen a monkeypox case before in our department. It is important to have a high level of suspicion to be able to diagnose monkeypox, and it is important that in the emergency room a PCR for monkeypox should be available.

We should remark that it is very likely that this patient got both syphilis and monkeypox from the same sexual partner. In fact, men using PrEP while not using a condom are not getting infected with HIV but are at high risk of getting infected of other STIs. Because [monkeypox] is sexually transmittable, it is likely that in the future more patients using PrEP are going to get infected with MPXV.

[Occurrence of coinfections of monkeypox (MPX) and other sexually transmitted diseases is not surprising. Previous studies have reported that a significant proportion of MPX cases also had other sexually transmitted infections. The above case is noteworthy because the syphilis ulcer confused the diagnosis. Laboratory tests are essential for establishing a reliable diagnosis. - Mod.TY]
