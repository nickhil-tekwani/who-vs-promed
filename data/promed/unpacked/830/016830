Pigs May Be Susceptible to Mad Cow Disease, Norwegian Feeding Regulations
Not Strict Enough?
---------------------------------------------------
M2 Communications - Norwegian pigs are fed bone-meal despite results
indicating pigs can be infected with mad cow disease (a transmissible
spongiform encephalopathy, TSE, known as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy,
BSE).
In 1996, bone-meal was banned in animal fodder as it has been suspected the
bone-meal was the source of infection for the disease. The ban includes
fish and horses, but in Norway, bone-meal from horses, cows, sheep and
goats has been used in pig fodder, despite pigs in laboratories having been
infected with BSE.
According to Aftenposten, a Norwegian newspaper, even bone-meal from pigs
is used in pig fodder. Norway however has stricter regulations for the
production of bone-meal than the EU (European Union).
Although it has not been proven that pigs can obtain BSE from the fodder,
pigs injected with prions, which cause the disease, did develop the
disease. According to neuropathology professor Jan Maehlen at Ulleval
hospital, the results from the laboratory show pigs can be infected and
there is cause for caution. Maehlen thinks Norway should be much more
careful with the animal fodder.
