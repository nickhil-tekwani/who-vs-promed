An outbreak of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS)
was reported in [Naypyidaw] in early April [2011], according to the
Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department.

The [Naypyidaw] District Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department
is educating the public about the disease, which causes reproductive
failure in breeding stock and respiratory tract illness in pigs.

On [7 Apr 2011], 100 pigs out of a total of more than 300 pigs at 2
pig farms in Pobba Thiri and Zabu Thiri townships in Naypyidaw were
infected with the disease. 10 pigs died. On [11 Apr 2011], the pigs
were diagnosed with PRRS. Authorities say there is no treatment for
the disease and no prophylaxis.

There are an estimated 100 000 pigs in [Naypyidaw], according to the
Health Department.

Similarly, in [March 2011], the disease was reported in
Aungmyetharsan, Chanayetharsan, Mahaaungmye, Chanmyatharsi,
Pyigyitagun, Amarapura and Madaya in the Mandalay region, where more
than 1000 pigs died of the disease.

Dr Tun Myint Soe, the deputy head of the Amarapura Township Animal
Husbandry and Veterinary Department, told Mizzima that, currently,
there is no PRRS in Amarapura.
"There is no spreading of PRRS in Amarapura. The spread of PRRS was
stopped by the intense heat," he said. A veterinarian in Pyigyitagun
Township told Mizzima that the disease is still spreading in small pig
farms in some townships, including Myitnge, Sintkai, Myinchan, and
Pyinoolwin in Mandalay region. "At first, the disease was spread among
small farms in urban areas," he said. "Later, the weather was colder.
Now the new outbreak has occurred in suburban areas. The death rate is
high."

In early April [2011], the Mandalay Division Animal Husbandry and
Veterinary Department distributed insecticide and disinfectant to
large pig farms and small scale domestic pig owners free of charge and
provided bio-technology control methods during field trips to inspect
farms.

The disease was first reported on [15 Feb 2011] in the Mandalay
area.

The World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE] earlier issued an
emergency warning in Burma [Myanmar] on the spread of PRRS [see
comment]

PRRS disease doesn't usually affect humans, and people in Mandalay
have not stopped eating pork, according to a resident. "We know that
if the meat is thoroughly cooked, we cannot be infected by the
disease," he said. "As far as I know, most people in Mandalay are
still eating pork."

[A request for information on the PRRS situation in Myanmar was
included in ProMED-mail's archive no 20071014.3372 (January 2007); the
question was raised in view of unconfirmed earlier media reports on
PRRS introduction to Myanmar after seriously affecting China and Viet
Nam; no response from Myanmar was obtained at the time.

Myanmar's 1st official report on PRRS has been submitted to the OIE
on 4 Mar 2011, addressing an outbreak which reportedly had started 15
Feb 2011, confirmed 28 Feb 2011, killing 210 out of the 559
susceptible pigs in the holding at Mandalay. The report, including an
interactive map, is available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=10318.

Mod PC commentaries in ProMED-mail archives 20100708.2278 and 20101201.4320.

[According to the article, PRRS was recently reported in Naypyidaw
Capital, which is approximately 250 km [155 mi] south of Mandalay
division. The Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department reported that
approximately 100 pigs from 2 farms were infected. In March 2011, a
PRRS outbreak was reported in Mandalay. PRRS is continuously spreading
in the Mandalay area. Surprisingly, it also reported that there is no
PRRS outbreak in Amarapura Township, Mandalay division, due to intense
heat.
