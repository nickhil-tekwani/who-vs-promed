Influenza update - 315 (based on data up to 29 Apr 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas, or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
Influenza activity returned to inter-seasonal levels in most of the countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere except for some countries in Eastern Europe. Activity increased in some countries in tropical America. In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity increased but remained below the seasonal thresholds. Worldwide, seasonal influenza subtypes A and B accounted for approximately the same proportion of influenza detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 107 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the period from 16 to 29 Apr 2018 (data as of 11 May 2018 03:42:35 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 97 697 specimens during that period of which 9993 were positive for influenza viruses. Among positive viruses, 5605 (56.1 percent) were typed as influenza A and 4388 (43.9 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 1503 (54.6 percent) were influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and 1252 (45.4 percent) were influenza A (H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 428 (84.9 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 76 (15.1 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

The communications department of Serra [municipality, Espírito Santo state] confirmed the 1st death of "super-flu" in the municipality in 2018. The case is a resident who was diagnosed with influenza A/H3N2. In addition, there is another confirmed case of H3N2 and 49 suspected cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; SRAG in Portuguese) in the city.

According to the city, approximately 54 900 people have been vaccinated against influenza. The vaccination campaign continues until 1 Jun 2018, in all units of Serra. In the regional units (Jacaraípe, Novo Horizonte, Feu Rosa, Serra-sede [center], Serra Dourada, and Boa Vista), from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. In the other units, according to the schedule of the vaccination center of each unit.

The communication office of the municipality was asked whether the vaccination would be available to all residents, to which it replied that the priority group receiving the influenza vaccine is defined by the Ministry of Health, and that so far the city has not received guidelines for vaccination of persons who are not in the priority group.

Another case that was under investigation is a 34-year-old woman resident of Nova Carapina, who died on 25 Apr 2018. The results released on 3 May 2018 dismissed the death from influenza. The report showed that the woman died of respiratory syndrome and pneumonia. The woman was admitted to the emergency department of Serra-Sede on 22 Apr 2018, with pneumonia. As influenza was suspected, she remained in isolation.

Another death also under investigation was that of a male resident of Vista da Serra. The results released on 10 May 2018 discarded the diagnosis of influenza H1N1 and again confirmed pneumonia as the cause of death.

The State Department of Health (SES) confirmed on [Wed 16 May 2018], 3 new deaths of patients with influenza virus infection in Pernambuco in 2018. Tests verified the presence of H1N1 virus in 2 patients, in addition to the 3 cases confirmed previously for the same virus. Also confirmed was the 1st death of a person infected with the H3N2 virus this year [2018]. In all, 6 people have died of influenza in 2018.

The epidemiological bulletin released by SES covers the cases recorded from January 2018 until 5 May 2018. In the same period of 2017, there was one death confirmed for influenza [?H1N1], and 5 deaths confirmed for influenza H3N2.

Of the 2 new cases of people dead from H1N1, one was a one-month-old baby, who died on [13 Apr 2018] in Carpina, in the area of Mata Norte of Pernambuco. The other case was that of a 17-year-old girl who died on [18 Apr 2018] in Camaragibe, in Greater Recife.

The 1st death of the year [2018] of a patient infected with the H3N2 influenza virus was a 9-year-old girl, who died on [24 Mar 2018] in Jaboatão dos Guararapes, in the Metropolitan Region.

The confirmation of the deaths occurred one week after SES ratified the 3rd death in the state this year [2018], a 41-year-old man who died in Palmares in the Mata Sul area of Pernambuco, on 2 Apr 2018, and tested positive for H1N1.

He lived in Barreiros, also in the Mata Sul area of Pernambuco, and died at the Palmares Regional Hospital. He was hospitalized on 13 Mar 2018, the same day he had reported severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; SRAG in Portuguese).

In all, the state has reported 594 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Of these, 22 had positive laboratory results for influenza A/H1N1, 11 for influenza A/H3N2, and one for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

Rumors
------
The health secretaries of Recife and Pernambuco denied rumors circulating inn social networks that, by April 2018, 4 people would have died victims of the influenza virus transmitted by the H3N2 subtype in the state.

Vaccination
-----------
In Recife, 170 fixed health posts are open from 8 am to 5 pm to vaccinate patients from the priority groups. According to the Secretariat of Health of Recife, children from 6 months to 5 years old, pregnant women, and women in the postpartum period, have priority for vaccination. Also those older than 60 years and professionals of the public and private education and health networks should be immunized.

Also included in the priority group are persons aged 12 to 21 under socio-educational measures, the population deprived of liberty, prison staff, as well as those with chronic non-communicable diseases and other special clinical conditions, such as cases in which the patient has 2 or more simultaneous diseases.

The vaccination campaign runs until 1 Jun 2018. In Pernambuco, the expectation is to immunize 90 percent of the 2.3 million people that are part of the priority groups.

Prevention tips
---------------
- Wash hands with soap and water often (especially before eating; touching the eyes, nose, and mouth; and after coughing, sneezing, or using the bathroom).
- When coughing or sneezing, cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue. After use discard them in trash cans.
- In the absence of a tissue, use the shoulder or inner forearm as a barrier when coughing or sneezing.
- Do not share food, glasses, bottles, towels and personal belongings.
- Keep the rooms ventilated, with doors and windows open, to promote air circulation.
- People with influenza/cold should avoid closed and crowded environments, as well as direct contact with others (hug, kiss, handshakes, etc.).

[The 'SARS' mentioned above refers to the general syndromic reporting of severe respiratory disease and not the viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Between November 2002 and July 2003, an outbreak of SARS in southern China caused an eventual 8,098 cases, resulting in 774 deaths reported in 37 countries, with the majority of cases in China (9.6 percent fatality rate) according to the WHO. ("Summary of probable SARS cases with onset of illness from 1 November 2002 to 31 July 2003." World Health Organization (WHO); http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/; retrieved 31 Oct 2008). No cases of SARS have been reported worldwide since 2004.- Mod.UBA

ProMED-PORT Mod.RNA commented
"SRAG ("Síndrome Respiratória Aguda Grave" or acute severe respiratory syndrome) is one of the strategies for surveillance of severe cases of influenza in Brazil since the 2009 pandemic. It was previously called DRAG (where "D" meant "doença" or disease) but was changed to SRAG because other viruses [adenovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus] also became targets of virological surveillance beside influenza virus.

In conclusion, all severe respiratory cases, from a surveillance perspective and independent of the primary causative viral agent, are initially reported as SRAG.

In 2018, EW 18 [week of 1 May 2018], in Brazil: 8107 cases of SRAG; 1005 were classified as SRAG by influenza virus; of them, 59.4 percent influenza A(H1N1)pdm09; 8.8 percent influenza A not typed; 11.1 percent influenza B; and 20.7 percent influenza A(H3N2). In 2018, the circulating H3N2 is a seasonal human strain."
