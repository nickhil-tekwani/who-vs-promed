ProMED-mail readers should know that the _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_ outbreak in the AP report on foxnews.com
<http://www.foxnews.com/js_index.sml?content=/news/national/
0724/d_ap_0724_4.sml> occurred in 1998.
Between 27 May and 24 June 24 *1998*, 416 persons in 13 states
reported gastroenteritis after eating oysters which were harvested
from Galveston Bay, Texas. Specimens from ill persons (n = 28)
yielded _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ isolates serotype O3:K6; the
first isolation of this serotype in the US.
Currently (26 Jul 1999), oyster beds in Galveston Bay are open for
harvesting.

[The error was ours; Fox News has a really confusing daily index
which mixes 1998 & 1999 news for the same day. Many thanks to
James for the correction - Mod.JW
