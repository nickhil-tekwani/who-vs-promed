The gears of the Darwin greyhound industry will grind into motion once again on [Sun 5 Nov 2017] following a 2-week hiatus caused by a deadly flesh-eating disease.

At least 4 dogs were killed in the Darwin Greyhound Association's kennels and 2 racing meets cancelled due to the outbreak of the tropical virus, which has been likened to the dreaded Melioidosis.

After cancelling their regular Sunday meetings for the past fortnight, association manager Greg Aldam confirmed to the NT News that Sunday's meeting would go ahead as planned.

"We have been given the green light to race by our stewards after a couple of traumatic weeks," Aldam said. "We are allowed to race after the stewards have inspected the track and kennels and gone through all safety measures that were put in place after the disease outbreak.

"This has been controlled and everyone within the club has performed due diligence admirably and as directed and requested by the stewards, vet specialists, committee and management."

Aldam said the association had been lauded by their counterparts down south for its handling of the outbreak.

"This is a major feather in the cap of the club ... our greyhounds' welfare and safety is of paramount importance, so to have worked as hard as we have is great news and shows the commitment and professionalism within the club to get on top of this disease as quickly as we have," he said.

"The fields this [Sun 5 Oct 2017] are amazing with 11 races and the trainers and owners have supported their club incredibly well after we have been through a tough few weeks."

The association's Winnellie kennels, which house around 150 dogs, were quarantined when the disease was 1st discovered midway through last month [September 2017].

The bacteria strand was attacking open cuts and wounds and causing them to become infected, before entering the bloodstream and causing potential death.

After missing 2 meets in a row, the association is entering a busy period, hosting 3 separate programs in 7 days, starting from [Sun 5 Nov 2017].

"We will be looking to race again on [Sun 5 Nov 2017] and then we have an extra meeting on [Wed 8 Nov 2017] and then another one on [Sun 12 Nov 2017]," Aldam said.

[Melioidosis, or Whitmore's disease is an infectious disease caused by a Gram-negative bacterium, _Burkholderia pseudomallei_, found in soil and water. It can affect animals and people. It is of public health importance in endemic areas, particularly in northeast Thailand, Vietnam, and northern Australia.

People can get melioidosis through direct contact with contaminated soil and surface waters.

Humans and animals are believed to acquire the infection by inhalation of contaminated dust or water droplets, ingestion of contaminated water, and contact with contaminated soil, especially through skin abrasions.

It is very rare for people to get the disease from another person. While a few cases have been documented, contaminated soil and surface water remain the primary way in which people become infected.

Besides humans, many animal species are susceptible to melioidosis, including:
- Sheep
- Goats
- Swine
- Horses
- Cats
- Dogs
- Cattle

There are several types of melioidosis infection, each with their own set of symptoms or clinical signs if it is animals.

However, it is important to note that melioidosis has a wide range of signs and/or symptoms that can be mistaken for other diseases such as tuberculosis or more common forms of pneumonia.

Intravenous or oral antimicrobials are usually the recommended treatment.
Meliodosis may not have been what the dogs had, but a flesh eating disease for any person or animal is a horrible situation. While animals, including dogs are susceptible to this disease, this article gives us very little clues as to exactly what could have been affecting these dogs. There are very few clinical signs. Certainly, we are pleased the dogs are better and the meetings are back in session. We would appreciate any definitive diagnostic information.
