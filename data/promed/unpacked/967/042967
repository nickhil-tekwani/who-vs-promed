For the 2nd time in a year there has been a spate of deaths in the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot population at a captive breeding centre in Hobart [Tasmania].

A common bacteria variety has killed up to 16 birds in the past month from a population of 136 at the Taroona facility.

In January last year [2016], rats got in and killed 14 parrots, which was described as "deeply disturbing" by the then federal environment minister Greg Hunt.

In 2013, a cat breached a perimeter fence and startled 2 birds which died after flying into an aviary wall.

Now, autopsies on 4 adults and a nestling in the government-run facility, as well as a nestling from Melaleuca, showed the dead birds tested positive to the bacteria _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_.

Orange-bellied parrots have previously died from the same bacterial infection at 2 mainland facilities.

The parrots migrate between Victoria and Tasmania's remote south-west where the 1st captive-bred chick has survived its 1st week with an adoptive mother.

No-one from the environment department, or the state's Environment Minister Matthew Groom, were available to be interviewed.

In a statement, a spokesperson for DPIPWE [Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment] said additional biosecurity measures had been put in place to stop the outbreak spreading further.

They include:
- all water for water bowls and food preparation being brought in from offsite;
- changing to new seed bags and disposing of old seed;
- treating water in water bowls with antibiotics.

"The concern for the parrot is being felt by all and these events are always devastating for all who care for this species, directly and indirectly," the spokesperson said.

"Following a successful breeding season in 2015/16 in which the Hobart Wildlife Centre produced 61 fledglings for the insurance and breed-for-release program it's been an absolutely heartbreaking start to the new year."

Tasmanian Greens MP Rosalie Woodruff said there was no excuse for 16 deaths linked to the infection breakout. "You might expect a couple of birds to die, but this is clearly a case of transmission between birds," she said. "And that suggests there's a lack of process and procedures, there may be training issues..."

Fears the parrots would go extinct within 2 years prompted researchers at the Australian National University to launch a crowd funding campaign late last year [2016].

Researchers are replacing infertile eggs with fertile eggs in wild nests, because captive birds had struggled to survive the winter migration.

[Orange-bellied parrots, (_Neophema chrysogaster_) is a small broad-tailed parrot endemic to southern Australia, and one of only 3 species of parrot that migrate (in this case from Victoria to Tasmania). With only 44 wild birds known to be alive after the summer 2012/13 breeding season, it is regarded as a critically endangered species. There are captive breeding programs at several facilities.

_Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ is an opportunistic pathogen and is part of the bacterial flora of conjunctiva and respiratory tract of psittacines. Other mortality events of orange-bellied parrots have been due to psittacine beak and feather disease.
