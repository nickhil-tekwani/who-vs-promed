99/115 Surveys on _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ and
_Ralstonia solanacearum_ in Lithuania [edited
Since the beginning of 1998, surveys have been carried out on potatoes in
Lithuania for _C. michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ and _R. solanacearum_
(both EPPO A2 quarantine pests). Tubers were tested by IFAS and ELISA in
1998 and additionally in test plants in 1999. A system of control measures
has been put in place for both these pathogens, in conformity with the
requirements of the European Union.
_C. michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_
------------------------------------------------------------
In 1998, 162 samples of Lithuanian seed potatoes collected from warehouses
in 3 regions were tested by IFAS and ELISA. Six cultivars from 3 regions
tested positive for the pathogen. The potatoes were derived from seed
potatoes produced in Lithuania (cv. Nida) or imported from other countries
(cvs Sante and Romano from the Netherlands, cv. Planta from Germany, cv.
Dietskoleskii from Russia).
In 1999 (up to 24 May), 114 samples (88 from seed potatoes [1880 t and 26
from ware potatoes [578) had been tested (IFAS, ELISA, biologically). Two
samples of seed potatoes were found contaminated, as well as 2 samples of
ware potatoes (from Lithuania and Poland).
In all farms where contaminated potatoes had been found, phytosanitary
measures have been applied.
_Ralstonia solanacearum_
-------------------------------------
All samples tested negative for the pathogen.
