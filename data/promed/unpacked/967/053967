France on alert after outbreak of West Nile fever
--------------------------------------------------
West Nile fever is believed to have killed 15 Camargue horses in the south
of France in recent weeks.
Although no case of human infection has been recorded, the local
authorities are taking no risks. A large programme of extermination of
mosquitoes and rats has been ordered in the marshlands known as the
"Petite-Camargue", west of the Camargue wetlands proper in the delta of the
Rhone.
The French government has also called on anyone living in the area - or who
has passed through in recent weeks - to consult a doctor immediately if
they fall ill with "flu-like symptoms".
The outbreak - the first in France for 34 years - is believed to have
started with a bird from one of a dozen species that migrate regularly, or
stray accidentally, between Africa and the French Mediterranean coast. The
West Nile virus passes from mosquitoes to birds and back to mosquitoes in a
permanent cycle but can sometimes spread through mosquito bites to humans
and other mammals.
4 horses are positively confirmed to have died from the disease in the past
3 weeks near the town of Lunel in the Herault departement, just east of
Montpellier. 3 other horses are strongly suspected to have died from the
virus; 6 other possible cases, including two in the Gard departement
slightly to the north, are being investigated.
The Prefect (the senior national government representative) of the Herault
has ordered an intensive programme of eradication of mosquitoes and rats in
the marshes of the Petite-Camargue. He has also advised people living in,
or visiting, the area to take action to protect themselves from mosquitoes,
including wearing long-sleeved clothes and using insect-repellents out of
doors and insecticides in their homes.
The last outbreak of West Nile fever in France was in 1966, also in the
Camargue, when 20 horses died.

[According to my copy of GIDEON <http://www.cyinfo.com>, there were 5 human
and 2 equine cases of WNV reported in Camargue during the period 1975 to
1980. This would mean that the last outbreak was 20 years ago, not 34 years
ago as stated in the above piece.
ProMED-mail will be interested to receive information on the method by
which the viral infection in the horses was "confirmed" as well as the
scope of any ongoing investigation looking for WNV in mosquitoes and birds.
I am not clear on why rats are being targeted in an extermination campaign
in an attempt to control WNV. -Man. Ed. DS]
