Health officials in Mali recently announced that there has been a resurgence of malaria with multiple new meningitis cases throughout the region.

There has been a sharp rise in malaria cases located in Mali's northern areas as well as other regions during the last few weeks.

To support the Ministry of Health in Mali, the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as its health partners, have provided the area with care and support for the cases that have been confirmed. These interventions have helped mobile clinics located throughout Timbuktu, Gao and Kidal [regions]. There are ongoing investigations to discover if the epidemic threshold has been attained or not.

Every year, health officials watch a resurgence in malaria cases during Mali's rainy season. The resurgence of the illness may be connected to the rainy season, especially since this year [2015] has had irregularly high rainfall. This has resulted in stagnant water where mosquitoes can breed.

[Malaria is endemic in Mali and transmission fluctuates according to season. It is difficult to know if there is a real increase comparing to previous years without actual numbers of cases. Impregnated bed nets are the main control measure and artemisinin combination therapy, ACT, is the drug of choice for treatment.
