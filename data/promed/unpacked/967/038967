FDA Approves Irradiation for Animal Feed
----------------------------------------
A process to treat animal feed with radiation to kill bacteria has been
approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
The agency said Tuesday that the process was approved to kill the
food-borne bacteria salmonella in all animal feed, feed ingredients, and
pet treats.
The process, called irradiation, exposes food products to ionizing
radiation, which causes chemical changes similar to conventional cooking or
other preservation methods. The technique does not cause the food to become
radioactive. Irradiation was earlier approved for use on a variety of human
foods.
"Extending this process to animal feed and feed ingredients will not only
increase the safety of the feed for the animals consuming it, but to people
who handle animal feed and feed ingredients," said an FDA statement.
"Irradiation is a useful tool for reducing disease risk."

[Although prevention of salmonellosis is not specifically mentioned in this
brief report, it is apparent from prior ProMED-mail postings cited above
that a number of outbreaks of salmonellosis have been attributed to human
handling of contaminated pet treats. Irradiation would, of course, produce
a more generalized reduction of bacterial contamination and should be
expected to result in improved safety of broader significance. - Mod.ES
