The [Hong Kong SAR] Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) today (28 Feb 2022) announced that samples taken from 3 wild pig carcasses under the surveillance programme for African swine fever (ASF) have tested positive for the ASF virus.

As there were a number of wild pig deaths found in Stanley recently, samples were collected by the AFCD from 3 wild pig carcasses found in the above-mentioned area for testing. The results were positive for the ASF virus. The AFCD will continue to monitor wild pig deaths and maintain surveillance in the wild pig population.

Currently, no pig farms are affected by this case. There are no pig farms on Hong Kong Island. The AFCD has notified all local pig farmers about the case with a reminder to them to enhance farm biosecurity to prevent intrusion of wild pigs and the introduction of the ASF virus into their farms. Local pig farmers are also reminded to notify the AFCD if their pigs show any health issues. The AFCD has been closely monitoring the health conditions of pigs on all local pig farms and samples will be collected for testing if necessary.

An AFCD spokesman said, "ASF is a highly contagious disease affecting domestic and wild pigs. However, it is not a zoonotic disease and does not infect humans [but lapses in biosecurity measures favor the spread of the disease], and hence does not cause any food safety risk. Well-cooked pork is safe for consumption."

The spokesman stressed that for personal safety and prevention of foods contaminated with the ASF virus being introduced to wild pigs, members of the public should keep away from wild pigs. They should not feed any wildlife, including wild pigs, and put garbage in lidded bins. That wild pigs found should be reported via 1823.

With a view to strengthening the surveillance of ASF on local wild pigs, the AFCD has been working with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) on a surveillance programme for ASF since late 2019. This has involved testing for the ASF virus in wild pig carcasses reported by the FEHD. The programme includes the New Territories and Kowloon. Other areas found with a large number of wild pig deaths are also included. To enable early detection, samples collected from humanely dispatched wild pigs are also tested for ASF.

[African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating hemorrhagic fever of pigs with extremely high mortality rates. In affected countries, it causes huge economic losses. ASF is believed to have evolved in a sylvatic cycle that occurs in eastern and southern Africa between common warthogs (_Phacochoerus africanus_) and argasid ticks of the _Ornithodoros moubata_ complex that share their burrows. But the tick is not necessary for the ASF virus transmission. If it were, the disease would not have spread to so many continents.

Pigs in the acute stage of infection develop high viremia and shed large amounts of virus in various secretions and excretions. The virus can tolerate a wide range of temperatures and pH. Pigs can become infected through direct contact with infected pigs or materials contaminated by infected pigs and eating uncooked meat products derived from infected pigs, as well as when infected _Ornithodoros_ ticks feed on them.

The importance of wildlife reservoirs for disease maintenance has been demonstrated. In Eastern Europe, the disease spread into the local wild boar populations. Further west or eastward spread could adversely affect the pig sector in many countries. - Mod.PMB
