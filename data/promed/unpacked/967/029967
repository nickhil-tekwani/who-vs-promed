The government and UN partners have stepped up immunisation efforts in overcrowded camps and makeshift shelters of Rohingyas close to the border with Myanmar amid an increased number of suspected measles cases among the newly arrived Rohingyas and their host communities, reports UNB.

"Children are especially at risk from outbreaks of measles and other communicable diseases that result from the crowded living conditions, malnutrition and severe lack of water and sanitation in the camps and other sites," said Unicef Bangladesh representative Edouard Beigbeder.

"To halt any wider outbreak, it's essential that coordinated efforts begin immediately to protect as many children as possible," the official was quoted as saying in a message received from UNICEF on [Fri 10 Nov 2017] night.

Nearly 360 000 people in the age group of 6 months -- 15 years among the new Rohingya arrivals in Cox's Bazar and their host communities, irrespective of their immunisation status, will be administered measles and rubella vaccines through fixed health facilities, outreach vaccination teams, and at entry points into Bangladesh.

Measles, a childhood killer disease which can be particularly dangerous among unimmunised and malnourished children, is one of the major health risks among the over 613 000 people who have crossed over to Bangladesh from Myanmar since late August [2017] and are now living in cramped and insanitary conditions in Cox's Bazar district.

As of [Sat 4 Nov 2017], 1 death and 412 suspected cases of measles have been reported among the vulnerable populations living in camps, settlements, and among the host communities in Cox's Bazar. Of them, 352 cases are from Ukhia and 46 from Teknaf upazilas, and 11 have been reported from the district hospital. The majority of cases - 398 - are among the new arrivals and 14 among the host communities. As many as 82 percent cases are among children under 5 years of age.

With the risk of measles being high during such health emergencies, the health and family welfare ministry with support of WHO, UNICEF and other local partners, was quick to roll out a measles and rubella (MR) vaccination campaign, between [16 Sep and 4 Oct 2017], within weeks of the start of the recent influx of Rohingyas from Myanmar. Nearly 136 000 children between 6 months and 15 years were administered MR vaccine. Additionally, around 72 000 children up to 5 years of age were given bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) and a dose of Vitamin A to help prevent measles related complication.

The number of new arrivals has increased since the MR campaign, which also had challenges reaching out to all children in view of movement of people within the camps and settlements.

WHO representative to Bangladesh N Paranietharan said as part of stepped up vaccination efforts, 43 fixed health facility sites, 56 outreach vaccination teams and vaccination teams at main border entry points will administer MR vaccine to population aged 6 months -- 15 years, along with oral polio vaccine to children under 5 years and TT vaccine to pregnant women.

"These efforts are aimed at protecting and preventing the spread of measles among the vulnerable population," said the WHO official.

Over 70 vaccinators from government and partners have been trained to deliver routine vaccination through fixed sites and outreach teams beginning on [Sat 11 Nov 2017], while vaccination at entry points at Subrang, Teknaf, is ongoing since [1 Nov 2017].

To improve hygiene conditions among the refugee population, 3.2 million water purification tablets and a total of 18 418 hygiene kits have been distributed benefitting 92 090 people.

The current initiative is yet another massive vaccination drive being rolled out for the new arrivals from Myanmar and their host communities in Cox's Bazar since [25 Aug 2017].

After covering 136 000 people in the September-October [2017] MR campaign, the ministry and partners administered 900 000 doses of oral cholera vaccine to these vulnerable populations in 2 phases.

[Since violence erupted across Rakhine State, Myanmar, on 25 Aug 2017, more than half a million people have poured across the border between Myanmar and Bangladesh. They have joined the more than 200 000 others who had came in previous cross-border influxes.

Almost 60 percent of the refugees are children, all of whom have suffered tremendous loss. As violence continues in Myanmar, their numbers and their needs grow. UNICEF is on the ground working with the Bangladeshi authorities and partners to help meet the Rohingya refugees' urgent needs (excerpted and edited UNICEF).

Since measles is a vaccine-preventable disease, it is one positive action UNICEF can take to reduce risk in these crowded living and unsanitary conditions.

[2] Bangladesh: vaccine

Research in Bangladesh has found that a quarter of children need more than single doses of the measles vaccine to be protected against the disease. This research supports the country's recent move to a double-dose approach.

Measles affects 20 million people and kills about 242 000 people worldwide each year. It is the 5th largest cause of death globally among children below 5 years of age and, in the absence of proper immunization, it spreads quickly in a population. In 2005, the number of measles cases in Bangladesh was about 25 935. This decreased to approximately 2660 cases in 2008 after the Measles Catch-up Campaign. But research in Bangladesh has shown that immunization programmes based on single doses of the vaccine are not sufficient.

Research carried out by Dr Sharmin Sultana, Medical Officer at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Bangladesh, and her colleagues found that about one quarter of the children who had just a single dose of the measles vaccine had not been totally immunized from the disease.

The research published in Bangladesh Journal of Medical Biology found that, although children were vaccinated against measles, many of them had not developed antibody response. "In my research, I found that children had not been fully immunized by the single dose of the measles vaccine and that they required a 2nd dose of vaccination to be better immunized," says Dr Sultana.

Fortunately, Bangladesh already made 2nd dose of measles vaccination compulsory in 2012, according to Dr Sultana, who added that, with the introduction of the 2nd dose of the measles vaccine, Bangladesh stands a better chance of achieving the target of eliminating measles by the year 2020. Dr Sultana plans to conduct follow-up research soon to assess the efficacy of the vaccination after the administration of a 2nd dose of the measles vaccine.

The research was conducted among 77 children of different age groups who had been administered a single dose of the measles vaccine.

[The MMR vaccine is very safe and effective. CDC recommends that children receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the 1st dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the 2nd dose at 4 through 6 years of age. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97 percent effective at preventing measles; 1 dose is about 93 percent effective. - Mod.LK]

First it was malaria and diphtheria, now there is a measles outbreak in Venezuela's Bolivar state. According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), between the last week of August [2017] and the 1st of October [2017], Bolivar State reported 570 cases of measles, specifically in 9 parishes of the Caroní municipality, of which 217 are fully confirmed. In the month of September [2017] alone, 300 cases were reported in Caroní.

Endocrinologist and member of the Venezuelan Endocrinology and Metabolism Society, Marcos Lima Martínez said, "we have not seen the preventive measures to contain the outbreak of measles," and explained that according to PAHO "76 percent of those affected in the state of Bolivar are children under 1 year of age", so on the recommendation of international health organizations the call to the population that has children with more than 6 months without receiving the trivalent viral vaccine go to the nearest ambulatory for immunization.
