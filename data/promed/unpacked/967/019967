The Public Health Bureau of the Pingtung County government in
Southern Taiwan announced Tuesday [12 Jul 2011] its 1st case of
Japanese encephalitis [JE] this year [2011]. The victim, a 44-year-old
woman residing in Pingtung City, was diagnosed with the mosquito-borne
disease [virus] 11 Jul [2011], becoming the 4th person in Taiwan to
contact the disease this year [2011], said the bureau.

The woman began suffering from headache and fever 4 Jul [2011] and
was hospitalized the next day, where tests confirmed that she had been
infected, health officials said. Inspections by the bureau revealed
that the patient lived in proximity to rice paddies and chicken coops,
which provide ideal breeding conditions for the _Culex_ mosquitoes
that carry the disease [virus].

The public should avoid rice paddies, livestock quarters, ponds, and
irrigation ditches at dusk, when the mosquitoes are at their most
active, bureau officials said. To lower the chances of infection, long
sleeves and pants should be worn, and mosquito spray [repellant]
should be applied to exposed areas if activity in these places cannot
be avoided, the officials added.

The Japanese encephalitis season is from May-October and infants
should be vaccinated as soon as possible, the bureau said. According
to the bureau, adults that work in high-risk areas can get vaccinated
but must pay for the shots.

[As noted in ProMED-mail archive no 20060909.2565, Taiwan is within
the broad geographical endemic JE belt that extends from South Asia
through Southeast Asia, East Asia, and the northern tip of Australia.
JE is the main cause of viral encephalitis in Asia, with 30 000-50 000
cases reported annually. The virus is a member of the flavivirus
family and is closely related to St. Louis encephalitis and West Nile
viruses.

Although most JE virus infections are inapparent, they can progress
to encephalitis and death, with neurological sequelae in some of those
who survive. The virus is maintained in birds and transmitted by
_Culex_ mosquitoes. Swine may serve as amplifying hosts.

There are 2 JE virus vaccines available, an attenuated product (SA
14-14-2) manufactured in China and an inactivated one (Biken) from
Japan. A JE fact sheet published by the US CDC can be found at
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/jencephalitis/facts.htm.
