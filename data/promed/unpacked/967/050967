I have noticed some misunderstandings among ProMED-mail subscribers
regarding the vaccination and treatment required under the Pet Travel
Scheme shortly to be piloted in the UK.
Vaccination is required against rabies, with a blood test to verify
satisfactory protection has been achieved. Animals must wait for 6 months
between the date the successful blood sample was taken before they can
enter the UK. (see MAFF website for full details).
In addition, 24-48 hours before entering the UK from one of the qualifying
countries, the animal must be treated against _Echinococcus multilocularis_
using praziquantel in accordance with the manufacturers instructions. The
animal must also be treated against ticks with an acaricide approved in
that country. This treatment must be carried out and certified by a
qualified veterinary surgeon in the qualifying country.
Full details of the Pet Travel Scheme can be found on the UK Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food website at <http://www.maff.gov.uk>
