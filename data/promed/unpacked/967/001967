Subject: foodborne outbreak in Turin, Italy
via: owner-foodsafe@nal.usda.gov
Today, 21 may 1997, there has been a foodborne outbreak in two towns in the
Piedmont - northern Italy - area surrounding Turin. More than one thousand
children aged 3-10 years old in schools of Moncalieri and Giaveno have
complained of vomiting, diarrhea, pain, and fever beginning from 10:00 a.m.
this morning (700 at 19:00 p.m.; 1000 at 22:00 p.m. and the number is now
increasing).
The cause is [apparently] the consumption of food served at the schools by
XYZ [name deleted], a company of the ABC [ditto] group - a significant
catering group of companies in Turin and the surrounding area. ABC also
serves all the FIAT plants in the region and almost all the schools in the
town of Turin.
First notices from TV, unconfirmed by the public health service, say that
the responsible dish is a cold tuna and maize salad, prepared from canned
foods in the early morning of yesterday and consumed yesterday at 12:00 a.m.
Practically all the children consuming the food have suffered this
"foodborne illness". [Moderator's ""]
Nothing is known at the moment about the involved foodborne pathogen.
