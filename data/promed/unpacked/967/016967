A rabies-infected stray dog bit 16 people, including 10 children, at Juhugaon in sector 11 of Vashi on Saturday [17 Jan 2015] morning. To add to the victims' troubles, the civic hospital in Vashi, which administered anti-rabies vaccine to them, ran out of haemoglobin shots [sic, probably immunoglobulin - Mod.MHJ], after which 10 patients had to go to KEM hospital in Parel. Five men, a woman, 4 girls and 6 boys were bitten by the dog around 11 am.

While 14 people have been discharged after treatment, Milka Kamble, 8, and Omkar Jadhav, 11, are undergoing treatment at the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) hospital, said hospital superintendent Dr Prashant Javade. Their condition is stable.

"While we had adequate stock of anti-rabies vaccine, there were only 6 doses of haemoglobin [sic] shots, which are required to boost patients' immunity. Hence, we had to ask 10 people to go to KEM hospital," said Dr Deepak Paropkari, NMMC medical officer, health.

The patients' kin complained they had a tough time at the hospital. "There was a delay in receiving treatment, as we had to wait for the case papers to be readied because of some problem in the outpatient department of the hospital," said the father of one of the children. "We also had to spend Rs 2600 [USD 42.00] for the haemoglobin shot at KEM, which would have been cheaper at the NMMC hospital," he added.

The stray was caught by NMMC's dog squad and put down. Paropkari said the step had to be taken as the animal was infected with rabies and could prove dangerous.

[To find Maharashtra go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_physio-2001.jpg. It is on the west coast of India. For Vashi go to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vashi.

It is normal to inject rabies immunoglobulin around the bite site to catch as much rabies virus as possible right from the start. This is followed by rabies vaccinations.

Even if a dog is patently "rabid" it is always wise to get a confirmatory laboratory diagnosis; even in the "old" days, such didn't take long -- though my colleague, Lionel Markson, the rabies pathologist at CVL, Weybridge complained that he never had a negative sample come in on a Friday afternoon, and he had to inject suckling mice -- and with PCR tests, it is but a few hours. Then one has hard and undeniable data, and it is easier to argue for structured proactive animal rabies control programmes, and this is a veterinary responsibility. - Mod.MHJ
