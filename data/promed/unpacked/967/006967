CHEO [Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario] and Ottawa Public Health have declared a chickenpox outbreak at the children's hospital after cases of the virus were confirmed onsite.

In a statement on its website, CHEO said: "A child contracted chickenpox in the community and was admitted to CHEO for other reasons, then developed a rash. Two other children were subsequently infected."

CHEO says all safety precautions are in place, adding: "The cases are contained, and the risk of transmission is extremely low."

Families whose children may have been exposed to chickenpox have been notified of the situation.

According to the Ottawa Public Health website, chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It is a very common childhood infection that can also affect adults.

The health unit says: "Chickenpox usually begins with a fever, followed in 1-2 days by a rash. The rash appears on the chest, back or stomach and spreads to other body areas. It usually starts with spots that soon become fluid-filled blisters. New spots appear over the next 2-3 days."

The chickenpox virus can spread from person to person through the air, in saliva, or through direct contact with the fluid in a chickenpox blister. Chickenpox develops 10-21 days after a person has been exposed to the virus.

Ottawa Public Health says the best way to protect yourself and your family from chickenpox is by receiving the chickenpox vaccine. The vaccine is recommended for healthy children ages 12 months-12 years of age.

In a message on its website, CHEO tells parents: "Most importantly, vaccines work. Please vaccinate your child for all preventable childhood infectious diseases."

[Chickenpox is a highly infectious virus spread through direct contact with someone with the illness as well as through the air and in saliva. About 90 percent of people without immunity will come down with chickenpox if they have close contact with someone 1-2 days before they show symptoms of rash and until all of the chickenpox lesions have crusted. It usually takes about a week for all the blisters to scab over and no longer be infectious. Complications from chickenpox can occur, but they are not common in healthy people who get the disease. The chickenpox vaccine is a safe, effective way to prevent chickenpox and its possible complications. - Mod.LK
