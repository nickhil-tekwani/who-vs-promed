Bighorn sheep monitored for disease in NV
-----------------------------------------
Bighorn sheep in 2 mountain ranges in northeastern Nevada are being
monitored after a number showed symptoms of pneumonia.

Nevada Department of Wildlife (NDOW) spokesman Joe Doucette says
agency biologists are keeping track of sheep in the East Humboldt
Range and the northern half of the Ruby Mountains.

Doucette says the agency is concerned because the Rocky Mountain
bighorns tend to congregate in the winter and any disease could more
readily spread.

The East Humboldts are home to about 180 bighorns while the northern
Rubies are home to about 160.

NDOW officials are urging the public to avoid such sheep wintering
locations as Beverly Hills and Welcome outside Wells and Lamoille
Canyon near Elko.

The agency is awaiting test results of samples taken from some sheep.

[Bighorn sheep are very sensitive to pneumonia. It appears to run
through flocks rapidly and with devastating results. This winter
season seems to be taking a toll on bighorn sheep in the north and
western regions of the US.
