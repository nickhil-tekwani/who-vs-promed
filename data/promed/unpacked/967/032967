Carcasses of over 150 olive ridley turtles and a bottlenose dolphin washed ashore were [20 Jan 2016] recovered by Forest department officials here [Puri, Odisha state] a top official said. The carcasses were found on the beach near Pantha Niwas. [Pictures of the turtle carcasses on the mentioned beach can be seen at the source URL above.]

"We suspect that the turtles were killed after being hit by the fishing trawlers in the sea," said Sarat Chandra Behera, an official of the Puri-Balukhand forest range, adding that the carcasses have been sent for post-mortem.

The turtles come in large numbers to Gahirmatha, the mouth of the rivers Devi and Rushikulya on the Odisha coast, for annual nesting, he said.

Though there is a prohibition on fishing for a 20-km [about 12.5 miles] distance from the beach in these 3 identified places, the trawler operators take fishing illegally there, Beher said. "We have to 1st check the reason behind deaths of turtles in such high number. We will direct the agencies concerned to look into the matter and take necessary action," Puri Collector said.

Recently, scores of whales were washed ashore to the Chennai beach. Despite all efforts by fishermen, at least 45 of them died, while the rest were rescued and put back in the sea.

A noted sand artist, who had created sand sculptures on the beach [in Puri], said, "On 20 Wed 2016, I found hundreds of dead turtles at the beach. I felt sad to see such a huge number of dead turtles." He appealed to the government through sand sculpture to find out the cause of death of turtles and also appealed to the people for protecting these sea animals.
