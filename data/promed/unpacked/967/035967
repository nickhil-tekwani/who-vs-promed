"All activities applied in combating FMD in the Vladimir region should be transparent; comprehensive information should be provided in the country and abroad," President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with rice producers in Sochi. He also requested support for the victims [animal owners].

"You have good people working on the matter; I do not doubt their qualifications. The only thing that I would like to ask is that nothing be hidden; the work should be transparent, clear in our country. Our partners must know the full details of what is happening and what steps we have undertaken in order to arrest these threats, in order to have the confidence of our partners."

Agriculture Minister Alexander Tkachev said that the work is "open" from the 1st day. "We are well aware that it is impossible to hide it," he said. "Most important is to confine and isolate the outbreak," the official said. "For us, it is a big blow, because as you know, we have been globally recognized just 6 months ago as a country free of FMD. For us, this disease problem is of course of fundamental importance, if we are talking about exporting to China and other countries," Tkachev said. "And everyone who has somehow suffered should be helped," concluded Mr. Putin.

The outbreak of FMD in the Vladimir region became known on 20 Oct 2016. The village is under quarantine. The livestock in the region has been vaccinated. This is the 1st outbreak of FMD in the region since 1993.

[2] Transparency, dairy products recall

Vladimir Putin called on the head of the Ministry of Agriculture not to hide the problem of foot and mouth disease of dairy products.

"Alexander, you are working with good people, I do not doubt their qualifications, the only thing I want to ask you: There should be nothing to hide; you have to be transparent and clear, and our country, as well as our partners abroad, need to know and to have full information about what is happening and what is being done to arrest this threat," his words according to TASS.

Alexander Tkachev has promised to solve the problem.

Previously, Federal Press reported that major retailers have received a letter from Rospotrebnadzor requesting the removal from circulation of almost 4000 tons of dairy products.

[The major (almost 4000 tons) recall of distributed dairy products by a large producer which received milk from the affected farm, mainly from the markets of the capital Moscow, has caused confusion and, according to the media, even some panic among consumers beyond Moscow (e.g. today's [28 Oct 2016] media report at http://tinyurl.com/zgoln5g). This was related also to the published relevant production period, from 1-19 Oct 2016. Notably, the FMD outbreak in Vladimir was 1st reported on 20 Oct 2016.

On top of that, the Russian health establishment (both medics and vets) traditionally consider, in striking difference with views elsewhere, FMD as a (significant) zoonosis. Official Russian health and veterinary sources describe human FMD infections, mainly milk-borne, which, in some cases, would -- according to them -- require hospitalisation. This debatable opinion is to be addressed in more detail in one of our next postings.

The transparency, advised by V. Putin, will be served by the early publication of the genotyping results.

The intervention of Vladimir Putin rings some bells (March 2001, PM Tony Blair, FMD epizootic in the UK, https://www.theguardian.com/pictures/image/0,8543,-12104142447,00.html_?). - Mod.AS
