The Veterinary Services Department (VSD) has destroyed 40 154 birds and 1103 crates of eggs as part of measures to contain the spread of the bird flu disease in the Greater Accra, Volta and Ashanti regions.

In addition, 37 bags of feed have been destroyed, with a feed mill situated in an outbreak area under investigation for destruction, while 23 987 birds have died from the disease.

The Deputy Minister of Food and Agriculture, Livestock, Dr Hanna Bisiw, made this known in an interview with the Daily Graphic shortly after the opening of a 3-day training programme for regional and district veterinary officers in Accra.

As part of the containment measures, the movement of poultry and poultry products from infected zones into free zones had also been banned.

Dr Bissiw cautioned that the ministry would not negotiate on the ban because that would encourage the spread of the virus. She stressed that movement from non-affected areas to affected areas would only be approved if the poultry and poultry products were accompanied with health certificates and movement permits issued by staff of the veterinary services department.

"We understand when people are used to doing something freely, and [when] there are restrictions, it is uncomfortable, but we are in an outbreak, hence we need to take special decisions to contain the disease and also completely kick it out of the country. When we have an outbreak, it's like you are at war with the disease or virus, so you cannot negotiate."

In a presentation on Bird Flu Update and Epidemiology, the Head of the Epidemiology Unit of MOFA, Dr Paul Polkuu, said that the 1st case was reported on 4 May 2015 and confirmed on 12 May 2015. Dr Polkuu mentioned commercial poultry, local poultry, guinea fowl, geese, ducks, turkeys, partridges, quails, and pigeons as species affected.

As part of facilitating the movement of the staff of the veterinary service and the fight against influenza, government has released 6 vehicles and 20 motorbikes to the veterinary services department and other things needed for the laboratory.

[Since the start of the HPAI H5N1 event in Ghana on 13 Apr 2015, 23 outbreaks have been recorded in this West African country and notified. The reports and a summarising map presenting the 9 accumulated outbreaks as of 14 Aug 2015 are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=17828.

The Ghana policy in relation to HPAI is "stamping out."

The disease has been spreading into and within other West African countries since early 2015 and so far has been reported from Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Niger, and Ghana; see interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/oqenf47 (click on the West African cluster and zoom in). It would be surprising if neighbouring countries such as Togo and Benin remain uninfected.

A follow up report from Cote d'Ivoire, dated 1 Sep 2015, reported spread of the disease there (6 new outbreaks; see
