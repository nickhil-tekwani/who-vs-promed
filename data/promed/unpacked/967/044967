Three people have died due to complications with relating to a Salmonella
infection in Szombathely (Vas County). Two of the patients were suffering
from another serious disease, which contributed to the severity of the
infection, National Public Health and Medical Officers Service (ANTSZ)
spokesperson Emese Ritook told fn.hu.
ANTSZ sent an official report on the events to the Vas County Police
yesterday, 24 Aug 2006. Based on available data, several people who
consumed a meal at a charity kitchen in Szombathely on 20 Aug 2006
developed diarrhea. It is suspected that the walnut cake served as a
dessert caused the food poisoning. By Wed, 23 Aug 2006, tests had shown
that the symptoms were the result of salmonellosis.
By 24 Aug 2006, the number of people who contracted the disease had risen
to 207; 67 needed hospitalization, and several were in a serious condition.
Three patients, a man and 2 women, died. The usual course of the disease
is a week, and statistics show that only one in 1000 Salmonella-infected
patients die, the ANTSZ spokesperson added.

[The serotype of the isolate involved is not stated. Indeed, the morbidity
and mortality of salmonellosis is increased in the very young and very old
as well as those with significant underlying diseases, especially those
involving cellular immune suppression.
If the cake is indeed the vehicle, it may have been related to raw egg in
the icing. A map of Hungary showing Szombathely in the extreme western
part of the country near the border with Austria can be found at:
