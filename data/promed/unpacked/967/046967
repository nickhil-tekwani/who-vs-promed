SOYBEAN DISEASES - USA: (LOUISIANA)

The outlook for soybeans across the state is mixed. LSU [Louisiana
State University] AgCenter's soybean specialist Ronnie Levy says the
rains that accompanied hurricanes Gustav and Ike kept farmers from
spraying for disease and insects in a timely manner. Diseases have
been a problem in fields across the state.

Cercospora has appeared in many fields. In other fields, farmers are
dealing with green bean syndrome, a problem that occurs when soybean
plants won't mature. Levy said Asian soybean rust has been identified
on soybeans across the state, including at the LSU AgCenter's Dean
Lee Research Station. "Once again, soybean rust came in at the point
where most soybeans won't be affected," Levy said. "We've seen this
for several years. We haven't had a real problem from rust because
people are using fungicides to help control it."

[Two species of the fungal genus _Cercospora_ are known to affect
soybean: Frogeye leaf spot, caused by _C. sojina_, which can infect
leaves, stems, and seeds causing significant yield losses of 10 to 50
percent (more info on frogeye is available via ProMED-mail post no.
20070627.2067); and leaf spot due to _C. kukuchii_, which causes
blight and purple seed stain. Both diseases are favored by warm
temperatures and high humidity, and the report above does not state
which one has been sighted.

The name green bean syndrome (GBS) is associated with plants that
never seem to reach maturity. It is not well understood yet, but it
is attributed to a combination of factors. Stinkbugs (insects in the
order _Hemiptera_) may be associated with it, and it is suggested
that they may transmit a phytoplasma involved in GBS. Aerial blight
caused by the fungus _Thanatephorus cucumeris_ has also been reported
associated with GBS. _T. cucumeris_ is a ubiquitous soilborne fungus
that causes different root and fruit rots in a large number of crops
(see 2007 ProMED-mail posts listed below).

Asian soybean rust (ASR) is caused by the fungus _Phakopsora
pachyrhizi_. It can cause premature defoliation with yield losses of
up to 70 percent and was introduced into the USA in 2004. It
over-winters in southern regions, and spores are being carried
northwards every season. More information on ASR can be accessed via
ProMED-mail post no. 20080928.3070 and the links below.
