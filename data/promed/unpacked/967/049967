Detection of Zoonotic Pathogens and Characterization of Novel Viruses Carried by Commensal _Rattus norvegicus_ in New York City

Results
-------
Seoul virus (SEOV) was the only virus detected in this study by specific PCR; no hepeviruses or other hantaviruses were identified. [Of the 133 rats sampled,] 8 were positive for SEOV, and there was a positive correlation between the presence of the virus and the age of the rat (P less than 0.001) but not the sex (Table 1). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of all samples from infected rats revealed variation in viral RNA levels across tissue types. Lung tissue was the most consistently positive (8/8 samples positive) and had the highest average viral RNA copy number, followed by kidney (7/8 positive), brain, salivary gland, and spleen (6/8 positive) (Fig. 1A). None of the urine samples were positive by any assay, although virus was detected in the oral swabs of the 3 rats with the highest average viral loads and most widely disseminated infections (Fig. 1A). Our phylogeographic analysis revealed that the SEOV strain sampled in this study, provisionally designated Baxter, is most closely related to the Humber strain (GenBank accession number JX879769) from the United Kingdom (Bayesian posterior probability [BPP] = 1). The introduction of SEOV Baxter into NYC [New York City] appears to be recent, as our analysis estimated the time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for the Baxter and Humber strains at 3-16 years before present (ybp). Complete nucleocapsid (N) and glycoprotein precursor (GPC) gene sequences of SEOV Baxter from the lungs of 4 rats were 100 per cent and 99.9 per cent identical to each other and 97.1 per cent and 95.5 per cent identical to the N and GPC genes of the Humber strain, further supporting the hypothesis of a recent origin. In addition, both the Humber and Baxter strains appear to have recently emerged from China, sharing a TMRCA of 8-35 ybp with the ancestral diversity of Chinese SEOV.

Discussion
----------
To our knowledge, this is the 1st identification of Seoul virus (SEOV) in NYC, and the high sequence identity, limited distribution, and recent TMRCA between SEOV Baxter and viruses from the United Kingdom and China suggest a recent introduction into NYC rats. Widespread serological evidence of exposure to SEOV in rats has been documented in nearby Baltimore since at least 1985, and human infection has been associated with multiple cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, chronic renal disease, and asymptomatic infections in Maryland and Los Angeles. This indicates that SEOV may have been present in NYC prior to the recent introduction identified here and undergone local extinction and reintroduction. Alternatively, SEOV may exist in multiple small, focal rat populations throughout NYC, of which we have sampled only one. Because the prevalence of rat or human antibody to SEOV has not been assessed in NYC and human infection may be asymptomatic or cause very mild disease, we are currently unable to distinguish between these hypotheses. However, if this virus has only recently been introduced into the NYC rat population, it may represent a potential risk to human health in the city.

[The detection of SEOV in New York City rats is interesting but not surprising. It was a very logical virus to look for in the sampled rats. The virus has been detected in _R. norvegicus_ rats in port cities in the USA, as mentioned above, and around the world. The virus has also been found in pet rats and a number of rat colonies in universities. Clearly, _R. norvegicus_ is carried around the world in maritime shipping and SEOV with it. As the authors suggest, the health providers in New York City need to be alert to human cases of SEOV infection, since these rats and humans live in close proximity. The above reference includes tables and figures, and mentions a number of bacterial and other virus pathogens that were detected in their sampled rats.
