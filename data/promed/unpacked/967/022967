A mysterious kidney disease that has killed more than 20 000 people may be linked to global climate change, according to a new study at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.

Professor Richard J. Johnson, MD, says the chronic disease has struck in Central America, killing mainly sugar cane workers.

"This could be the 1st epidemic directly caused by global warming," Johnson said. "Some districts of Nicaragua have been called the 'land of widows' due to the high mortality rates occurring among the male workers from chronic kidney disease."

First described in 2002, the disease was dubbed Mesoamerican Nephropathy. Theories to its cause included exposure to heavy metals, pesticides and other toxic chemicals. But Johnson believes the actual culprit is chronic, recurrent dehydration.

His research team found that the laborers in Nicaragua and El Salvador routinely worked in conditions exceeding the recommended heat standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Even though some of them drank up to 1 to 2 liters of water per hour, researchers found they still suffered serious dehydration.

"Temperatures have been progressively increasing in El Salvador over the last century, with an average increase of 0.5 degrees Celsius since 1980," the study says. "While the overall increase in temperature may appear small, it has been shown that the small average temperature change associated with global warming are responsible for 75 percent of the moderately daily severe temperature extremes over land."

A major side effect of this dehydration was hyperuricemia, or excess uric acid levels in the blood.

Johnson recommended improving work conditions and hydration practices among those most at risk for developing the disease.

"Adequate hydration with water and/or electrolyte-containing water has been reported to prevent increases in serum uric acid that occurs with heat and exercise," he said. "We also suggest more research into the role excess uric acid plays in chronic kidney disease."

The study was published in the latest edition of the American Journal of Kidney Diseases.

[This article seems misleading. There is no direct evidence of global warming being the cause of the problem with the sugar cane workers. There are many areas of the world that are hot and people work. However, chronic dehydration is a problem. Lack of electrolyte replacement may also be a problem.

What would be more helpful is to rehydrate these workers, and provide necessary electrolytes and learn if the problem resolves. This study seems very incomplete and is trying to make a case for global warming, not solving a problem in a working environment. - Mod.TG
