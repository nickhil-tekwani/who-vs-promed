EPPO Report on selected intercepted consignments
When a consignment has been re-exported and the country of origin is
unknown, the re-exporting country is indicated in brackets. When the
ccurrence of a pest in a given country is not known to the EPPO
Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*).
The EPPO Secretariat has selected interceptions made because of the
presence of pests. Other interceptions due to prohibited commodities,
missing or invalid certificates are not indicated. It must be pointed out
that the report is only partial, as many EPPO countries have not yet sent
their interception reports.

[This means that Syria has not reported being infected with
_Ralstonia_, therefore either it occurs there unreported, or the
shipment did not originate there. Note the ref. above to the finding
by UK of _Ralstonia_ in a shipment ostensibly originating in Syria,
and by France in a shipment ostensibly originating in Germany, but
denied by the latter country - Mod.JW]
[Assuming that the diagnosis is correct, this report is a reminder to
quarantine agencies that not all diseased specimens will necessarily be
detected in a [country] survey based on a sampling protocol. It remains
to be determined whether or not the pathogen is present in Syria. Closer
examination of shipments and tighter monitoring of commodity
movements may be necessary - Mod.DH]
