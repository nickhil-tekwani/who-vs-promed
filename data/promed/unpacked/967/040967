ANTIBIOTICS, CONSEQUENCES OF AGRICULTURAL USES

Henrik Wegener of the Danish Veterinary Laboratory was cited as saying that
a clear link between the use of antibiotics in animal feed and the emergence
of "superbugs" in hospitals has been established for the first time.
Genetic tests on bacteria in the gut of people, pigs and chickens have shown
that resistance to vancomycin, a widely used antibiotic, developed when a
similar drug was used in animal feed.
The story says that antibiotics are given in animal feed because they
typically increase animals' growth rate by 5 per cent.
The story says that by isolating the gene responsible for vancomycin
resistance in enterococci from people, pigs and chickens, Dr Wegener
demonstrated that the resistance moved from animals to human beings.

[Yet again we suffer from too brief an announcement attached to journalistic
conclusions. That vancomycin resistance in enterococci may be encouraged by
certain livestock feed practices is one thing. That ipso facto it is
transferred to human beings is another and to the very specific
subpopulations of humans (e.g. hospitalised elderly) shown to be at risk of
having vancomycin resistant bacteria is a further question. Comments from
those more cognizant than this moderator of the epidemiology of this
resistance are appreciated. We are attempting to find a more complete script
than the above. - Mod.MHJ]
