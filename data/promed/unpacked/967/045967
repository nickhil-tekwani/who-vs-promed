Diagnostic Testing May Diminish Blood Donation
----------------------------------------------
Scientists in Switzerland believe they have made an important breakthrough
in the search for a blood test for variant Creutzfeld-Jakob disease
[abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail. The UK National
Blood Service fears there could be a drop of around 50% in the amount of
blood in blood banks as people grow afraid about being subjected to the
test. It believes that even if the results were not released to donors,
many would drop out for fear of having the test and positive samples would
have to be discarded. When the screening for HIV was introduced, there was
a 5% fall in donations.
The BBC programme on Thursday stated that the National CJD Surveillance
Unit in Edinburgh is sending blood samples to the Swiss scientist Dr
Claudio Soto. He will use them to test a new technique that could lead to a
blood test for humans within months. Dr Angela Robinson, Medical Director
of the National Blood Service, said she was encouraged by Dr Soto's work.
"We have been desperately searching for a diagnostic test that really will
work for quite some time now, and this looks very promising."
However, Evan Harris MP, a member of the British Medical Association Ethics
Committee, told Newsnight he was worried about how the test would be
applied. "I would say it's not a good thing for doctors to be involved in
that process...until something can be done with the information."
Peter Smith, Acting Chairman of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory
Committee, said the test could have an important public information role.
He said that: "One of the prime epidemiological purposes will be to use a
test such as this one being developed to estimate the size of the
population that has been infected." Professor Smith expected that
individuals going to donate blood "would have to be told that this testing
was going to be done." He added: "I personally would find it very difficult
to see a situation where testing was done and it was found positive and
individuals were not told that result, even though at this stage we really
don't know what we tell them with respect to the prognosis."
Officials at the National Blood Service are now working on a worst case
scenario to cope if there is a drop in the amount of blood available. They
stressed that a 50% drop was the worst they feared and it might be much less.
