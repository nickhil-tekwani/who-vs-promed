Two prominent French reference laboratories have confirmed that the source of the listeriosis outbreak here was the smoked pork product "Extra Mein," made by a Kumanovo-based company, the Macedonian health minister said on Friday [31 Oct 2014].

The test results from the Paris-based Louis Pasteur Institute and Anses confirmed the primary findings of the source investigated by Macedonian institutions. The results will be submitted to the Macedonian Public Prosecutor's Office, where the case has already been filed.

10 patients were infected with _Listeria_ bacteria in July and August [2014] in Macedonia, 5 of whom died.

Listeriosis is a bacterial infection commonly caused by consuming _Listeria [monocytogenes_] bacteria-contaminated food such as processed meat, unpasteurized milk and diary products, and insufficiently washed fruits and vegetables. The immunocompromised, such as the elderly, pregnant women and newborns are vulnerable to listeriosis, which can cause infections of the central nervous system (meningitis, meningoencephalitis, brain abscess, cerebritis) and bacteremia.

Prevention includes washing raw food thoroughly as well as reheating leftovers or ready-to-eat foods until steaming hot.

There are now 10 patients involved in the Macedonian listeriosis outbreak, including 5 deaths, associated with consumption of the smoked pork product "Extra Mein" made by a Kumanovo-based company. The above news report says that Louis Pasteur Institute and Anses confirmed this association, presumably by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of isolates of _L. monocytogenes_. However, in the prior post on this outbreak, the manufacturer of the pork meat product contended that contamination with _L. monocytogenes_ occurred after the product left their facility (Listeriosis - Macedonia: (UM) fatal, pork meat product alert, recall 20140808.2670279).

In the US, _Listeria monocytogenes_ isolates, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue), are forwarded to state public health laboratories for PFGE subtyping, the results of which are submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance, to identify clusters of possibly related cases. When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to those from patients outside the cluster (http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/surveillance.html).

Kumanovo is a city with a population of 70 842 (in 2002) and a municipality in the Northeastern Statistical Region, one of 8 statistical regions in the Republic of Macedonia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumanovo).
