The Council of Agriculture (COA,) on [7 May2015] announced a ban on the transport or sale of all cloven-hoofed animals, as well as fresh and processed meat products from Kinmen County [Fukien province], including beef jerky, effective immediately.

According to the COA, samples taken from a carcass at a slaughterhouse in Kinmen during routine inspections tested positive for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).

Officials of the Kinmen County Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection traced the infected carcass back to a stock farm, where additional screening revealed that one out of the 15 animals tested was infected with the virus, officials said.

The infected specimen underwent further testing, leading investigators to believe that the animal may be infected with the type-A FMD virus, according to officials.

Once experts confirm the diagnosis, this will be the 1st first case of type-A FMD in the nation, said Chang Su-san director-general of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ)

For precautionary purposes, the infected cow was euthanized immediately, according to Chang. Moreover, the COA held a press conference later in the day, announcing a ban on all cloven-hoofed animals and manufactured products from Kinmen.

The COA will gather FMD experts for a conference today to further examine the specimen and to confirm whether it was infected with type-A FMD, said Chang. Moreover, she added that a specimen will also be sent to the World Organization of Animal Health (OIE) for outside confirmation.

If authorities confirm the diagnosis of type-A FMD, all 176 cattle of the stock farm will be immediately put down, followed by disinfection procedures, said officials. All cloven-hoofed animals within a 1-kilometer radius will also be subject to testing.

Vaccine does not work for different virus types. According to the COA, the nation underwent a type-O FMD outbreak in 1997. However, the vaccine for type-O FMD is ineffective when applied to the type-A FMD virus.

Officials said at the press conference on [7 May 2015] that the COA currently has 500 doses of the type-A FMD vaccine, however, the council plans to euthanize any infected cloven-hoofed animals upon a positive type-A FMD diagnosis.

"Even though humans are rarely infected with FMD, the nation cannot afford another FMD outbreak, as it would severely damage the economy. We must do our best to avoid any potential type-A FMD infection from spreading nationwide," said Chang.

[According to the newswire above, animals may be infected with the type-A FMD virus, the 1st case of type-A FMD in the nation.

In March 1997, a FMD epidemic broke out in the Taiwan pig industry and within 4 months some 40 per cent of the pig population was lost to the disease. The disease spread quickly throughout the island but was contained within 2 months by slaughtering of infected pigs and blanket vaccination. The outbreaks were caused by a pig-adapted virus strain (O/Taiwan/97) which did not infect other species of cloven-hoofed animals by natural route.

In June 1999, the 2nd strain of FMD virus (O/Taiwan/99) was isolated from Chinese yellow cattle in the Kinmen Prefecture and in the western part of Taiwan. By the end of 1999, Chinese yellow cattle were the only species infected and those infected cattle did not develop pathological lesions [1].

In [2012] the FMDV serotype O that invaded Kinmen was identified as the 1st SEA topotype in Taiwan's territory and identified by nucleotide sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis. The Southeast Asia topotype, one of the topotypes within serotype O of the virus, is prevalent in some Asian countries, but had not previously been found in Taiwan. Pig was the only infected species during the outbreak. [2]

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease characterized by rapid onset and high morbidity in a wide range of susceptible host specific.

FMD is notifiable to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and as a consequence FMD affected countries have restricted trade in livestock and livestock products with FMD free regions and countries.

A cloven hoof is a hoof split into 2 toes. This is found on members of the mammalian order _Artiodactyla_. Most even-toed ungulates such as sheep, goats, deer, cattle, bison and pigs have 2 main hooves on each foot, together called a cloven hoof.

Vaccination of any suspected FMD cases is of utmost urgency to control the contagiousness of the causative virus.
