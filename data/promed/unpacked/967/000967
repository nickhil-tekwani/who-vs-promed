Genetic data shows 2nd phase of foot-and-mouth infection did not
originate from Pirbright
----------------------------------------------------------------
Genetic analysis by scientists at the Institute for Animal Health
(IAH) has shown that the 1st and 2nd phases of foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) infections of the 2007 outbreak comprise a single chain of
transmission events. The 2nd phase could not have separately and
directly originated from the site housing IAH's Pirbright Laboratory
and the vaccine company Merial.

IAH and its sponsoring body, the Biotechnology and Biological
Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), strongly refute unsubstantiated
and incorrect claims in The Times newspaper on 13 Dec 2007 that the
2nd phase of infection in the Virginia Water area was caused by
infected soil removed from Pirbright.

IAH scientists have shown through genetic sequencing data prepared
for Defra (UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs),
and passed to Government vets in September [2007] during the outbreak
to inform their response, that the FMD viruses found in the Virginia
Water area were derived from the earlier infected premises in
Normandy, Surrey and not from a reintroduction from the Pirbright
site. The 2nd phase was a continuation of the 1st phase of the
outbreak in August [2007]. By studying the genetic fingerprints of
the FMD virus recovered from the different infected premises in the
2007 outbreak scientists have been able to determine the probable
sequence of transmission between Infected Premises.

As the virus passes from animal to animal and farm to farm, it
accumulates changes in its genetic code and from these changes, the
chain of relationship of the viruses during a series of infections
can be determined. From this it is possible to establish with
considerable molecular precision which viruses are descendants of
which parent viruses. The data have been peer reviewed by a group of
leading scientists at the request of Defra's chief scientific adviser
and are due to [be] published shortly. The independent expert peer
review process has accepted the study's conclusions that the 2nd
phase of the outbreak originated from the 1st phase and not from a
separate release from the Pirbright site.

Notes to editors
----------------
Scientists at the Institute for Animal Health's Pirbright Laboratory
have determined the sequence of every gene of the FMD viruses
associated with each of the farms infected in the 2007 outbreak. This
has produced evidence that makes it possible to identify the probable
origin of the virus at each outbreak. This is possible because the
genetic material (RNA) of FMDV changes (mutates) as the virus grows.

It is usual to find 4 or so mutations as it moves from farm to farm;
its fingerprint changes, a particular fingerprint being associated
with a particular farm.

[The statement above has been followed by a public debate in the UK
media as to the institution responsible for the renewed FMD outbreak,
discovered after Defra's declaration on the completed eradication of
the disease.

The encouraging bottom line is the absence of additional cases since
4 Oct 2007; for the thread of UK's official OIE (World Organisation
for Animal Health) notifications on FMD during 2007, see
