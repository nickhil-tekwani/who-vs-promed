LIBERIBACTER, SOLANACEOUS CROPS - NORFOLK ISLAND: FIRST REPORT

The tomato-potato psyllid (_Bactericera cockerelli_) has not previously been detected on Norfolk Island, but has now been found as part of a major quarantine survey co-ordinated by the Australian and Norfolk Island governments.

Andrew Geering, Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation, said, "The psyllid feeds on tomato, potato and capsicum crops [and] transmits a serious disease known as Zebra chip caused by the bacterium _Ca._ Liberibacter solanacearum, which we have also found in these crops on Norfolk Island."

The psyllids likely came from New Zealand on illegally imported plant material or in cargo.

The discovery has given scientists a head start in controlling a major biosecurity threat to Australia. There are strict quarantine measures in place between Norfolk Island and Australia.

[Only a few members of _Candidatus_ Liberibacter have been characterised so far, including the pathogens causing citrus greening (huanglongbing, HLB; for more information see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). HLB, one of the most damaging diseases of citrus, is limited to these crops due to the host specificity of its psyllid vectors.

A new liberibacter species was found to be associated with zebra chip (ZC; reported yield losses up to 60 per cent) and psyllid yellows (PY) diseases of potato, as well as a new yellowing disease of tomato and capsicum crops in New Zealand. The new pathogen was given the preliminary name of _Candidatus_ Liberibacter solanacearum (Lso; synonym _Ca._ L. psyllaurous). Lso is transmitted by the potato (or tomato) psyllid _Bactericera_ (synonym _Paratrioza_) _cockerelli_, which has a much wider host range than the HLB vectors, including species in 20 plant families; additional vector species are also being identified further extending potential host range and economic impact of the pathogen.

Lso has since also been associated with yellowing diseases of other solanaceous crops (physalis, tomatillo, aubergine, tamarillo, tobacco) and some crops in the family Apiaceae (carrot, celery). Currently, the species is divided into 4 haplotypes: A & B affecting Solanaceae, C & D affecting Apiaceae. Both groups of haplotypes have been reported from the Americas and New Zealand (for example, ProMED-mail post 20090515.1819). In Europe, only carrot haplotypes have been reported so far. Lso has not yet been detected outside these regions.

In Norfolk Island, both Lso and its vector have been found to be widely spread at varying densities across the island so that eradication would be impossible. Biological control measures for the psyllid to reduce populations are being considered (see additional stories below).
