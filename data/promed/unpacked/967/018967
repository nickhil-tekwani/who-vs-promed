CLASSICAL SWINE FEVER - EUROPE (03)
===================================
Date: Thu, 06 Mar 1997 10:39:54 GMT
From: Vincent_Dedet@invivo.edu (Vincent Dedet)
[see: Classical Swine Fever (CSF) - Europe 970219005517
Classical swine fever - Europe (02) 970228175819]
The preliminary results of the EC reference lab for CSF indicate a very
close relationship between the German and Dutch strains of virus, although
the clinical expression is really different, but this point seems to be
usual in CSF.
A status update number of infected herds on the 5th of March follows:
Germany : 26
Netherlands: 34, but all the foci since number 16 are located in the same
original area. This is good news regarding the control of the epidemic.
Italy: 2 + 1 suspicion (not confirmed)
Belgium : 0
France : 0
Spain : A preventive slaugther of 20,000 pigs took place all over the
country between 4 and 8th of Feb. All the samples examined (not all pigs)
are negative. But no information is available yet on the location of the
farms,the number of samples and the type of analysis. Furthermore, pigs
came from at least one Dutch farm that was subsequently infected (like what
happened in Italy).
[Thanks very much for the update, Vincent. Mod - pc]
