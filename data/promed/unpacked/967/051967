3 moose confirmed dead from chokecherry, yew
------------------------------------------------
A popular ornamental flowering tree considered a nuisance for
displacing native Anchorage plants now has another knock: it's killing
moose.

State wildlife officials have confirmed that 3 moose have died after
eating buds, branches, or berries from European bird cherry, known
locally as Mayday trees or chokecherry. One moose also had consumed
toxic levels of Japanese yew.

European bird cherry is a deciduous tree that grows 15 to 30 feet high
94.5-9 m] and is prized by homeowners for blooms with fragrant white
flowers in late spring or summer. It's dark green leaves turn red in
July. The fruit is a black cherry sought by birds, often attracting
flocks of Bohemian waxwings after snow has covered other plants.

European bird cherry is dominant along many streams in Anchorage, and
it can be toxic to animals with segmented stomachs. Its danger to
cattle is well documented, said state wildlife veterinarian Dr
Kimberlee Beckmen, and goats, deer, and moose also are at risk.

When buds are chewed and swallowed, they react with chemicals in the
rumen, the 1st division of the stomach. The chemical reaction releases
cyanide gas that can kill a moose in 20 minutes, Beckmen said. But it
all depends on when the moose browses on Mayday trees.

"They're not toxic all the time," she said. "The toxin builds up under
certain weather conditions and growing conditions and fertilization. A
chokecherry tree that moose feeds on in the summer, no problem
whatsoever."

In fall, when the 1st freeze hits, the toxin builds up and moose are
susceptible.

"A week later, that plant won't even be toxic anymore, because the
toxin dissipates," she said.

A moose died in 2006 after eating European bird cherry. Biologists
found 2 cases in January and a 3rd this month [February 2011] while
examining carcasses for evidence of disease.

"It's possible that more moose die each spring as a result of cyanide
poisoning, but we don't have the personnel or resources to examine and
test them all," Beckmen said.

When skinny moose are found dead in yards, the assumption has been
that they died of starvation, but the recent cases indicate that may
not be the case. Death for poisoned animals comes fast.

"It's producing a gas inside their rumen and they absorb that gas,
plus they inhale it back, so they die really quick," she said.

Samples of the moose liver and muscle, the rumens, and tree clippings
were sent to the Wyoming State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in
Laramie, Wyoming, where analytical tests confirmed cyanide.

"In the 3rd case, the most recent one, the smell of bitter almonds,
which is the cyanide gas, was overpowering when they opened the
rumen," Beckmen said. "The gas was still being produced as the
chokecherries were being digested."

That moose also had eaten Japanese yew, which can poison humans. It
produces taxane, which stops the heart.

"We don't know which killed it first, but it had 2 things at the same
time," Beckmen said.

European bird cherry is also found on Fairbanks lawns but no
poisonings have been detected, Beckmen said, perhaps because the
interior Alaska city has fewer mid-winter thaws. The Department of
Fish and Game plans additional investigation to determine if the moose
deaths were connected to thawing.

"A week before one of the cases it got up to 40 deg F [4.4 deg C] in
Anchorage," she said. "So perhaps the plants essentially wake up and
start to grow a little bit and produce toxin. We don't know that."

One moose was poisoned after eating Mayday tree branches that had been
clipped in the fall and stored under a deck. The department is
recommending that property owners cover or dispose of European bird
cherry and Japanese yew clippings.

[This article mentions skinny moose. For a moose to eat certain things
it has to be in poor body condition, or have an acquired taste for a
particular plant. In this case it sounds like these moose were not
getting nearly enough to eat. Consequently hungry animals will eat
things that non-hungry animals will not eat.

The bird cherry (_Prunus padus_) is not native to North America, but
seemed to have originated in northern Europe, including Norway,
Finland, and Sweden, thus the plant is adapted to growing well north
of the Arctic Circle.

The European bird cherry is a different variety than the Chinese bird
cherry, but they are both _Prunus_ spp. All _Prunus_ spp are regarded
as being toxic because of their ability to produce prussic acid.

Prussic acid, hydrocyanic acid, and hydrogen cyanide are all terms
relating to cyanide poisoning. The _Prunus_ spp of plants and other
common plants may accumulate large quantities of cyanogenic
glycosides, (a sugar compound with cyanide attached) which are located
in the outer tissue or epidermal layer of the plant.

An enzyme resides in the inner or mesophyll leaf tissues. When an
event stresses the plant, such as frost, drought, drought followed by
rain and a sudden burst of growth, or trauma to the plant, the
mesophyll portion of the plant or leaf releases the enzyme, which
breaks down the cyanogenic glycosides releasing the cyanide compound
and the sugar. The sugar makes the plant tasty and cyanide makes the
plant deadly.

Japanese yew (_Taxus cuspidate_) produces taxane, a cardioactive
compound. This plant is eaten by curious animals, and by those that
are very hungry.

With both toxic plants in one animal it would be difficult to say
which toxic agent was responsible for the animal's demise.

However, with plant parts of the bird cherry in several animals, this
is evidence these animals are likely hungry, and eating this plant.
This plant has likely experienced some growth in the 40 deg F (4.4 deg
C) weather and then a cold blast of weather stressed it, thus
releasing the cyanide compounds.
