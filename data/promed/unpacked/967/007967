As of October 2019, Gideon https://www.GideonOnline.com and the Gideon e-book series contain details of 69 204 epidemiological surveys, of which 1107 (1.6%) are related to the prevalence of specific viral species in patients with respiratory tract infection (1-3).

The following chronology of published studies summarizes the relative proportion of viral agents associated with non-influenza childhood respiratory infection in the USA. Additional details and primary references are available on request.

Year(s) / Location

1976-2001 / Tennessee

Coronaviruses were found in 5.0% of nasal wash specimens from children below age 5 years with upper respiratory infection or lower respiratory infection; 9% of these [were human coronavirus] 229 E, 59% [human coronavirus] OC43 and 33% [human coronavirus] NL63.
