Two weeks after the restrictions were cleared by the European Union, the
Department d'Agricultura de la Generalitat has detected a new outbreak of
Classical Swine Fever in a farm in Calldetenes (Osona, Barcelona) with 2944
pigs.

Confirmatory lab results are awaited today, but in the meantime the
information has been sent to the European Union and movement restrictions
on pig transport have been imposed within the Spanish autonomic region of
Catalunya.

During the last epidemic in the province of Lleida, between 14 Jun 2001 and
19 Sep 2001, 19 outbreaks were confirmed and 81 414 pigs slaughtered. Other
outbreaks were detected in Valencia and Cuenca, more than 300 kilometers
from the original foci.
