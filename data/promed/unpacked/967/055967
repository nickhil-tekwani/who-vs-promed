Three more patients with cholera have been recorded in Ben Tre,
increasing the number of patients with the disease in the Mekong
Delta province to 25 this year [2010], a health official said Fri 21 May 2010.

The provincial Preventive Health Center is cooperating with health
clinics at districts where the patients live to test water samples
and instruct local people about preventive measures, said Nguyen Van
Thang, vice director of the Ben Tre Department of Health.

Ben Tre is one of 8 provinces and cities to be hit by cholera so far
in 2009. Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City are among the affected
localities. Seven cases have been recorded in the southern metro,
while the capital has reported one patient so far.

Cholera infected hundreds of people in northern Viet Nam in 2008 and 2009.

After 7 cholera cases were detected in Choranda village of Karjan
taluka, the Vadodara district health department has declared the
village cholera-hit. A 26-year-old woman is reported to have died of
the disease.

A Health department team has detected 46 cases of gastroenteritis in
the village in the past week. Sources said a leak in a sewage water
pipeline in the village a week ago contaminated the drinking water
supply, leading to an outbreak of diarrhea and vomiting cases.

"Eight medical teams are constantly monitoring the area. Only a part
of the village has been affected by the disease. We have taken all
measures to prevent the spread of the disease," said B R Solanki,
Chief District Health Officer, Vadodara.

Four patients have been admitted in a Karjan hospital, and 3 others
are under observation at a nearby Community Healthcare Centre (CHC).
Water is being supplied through tankers, and the damaged water
connection is yet to be fixed.

Cases of dysentery have been reported in Ikhabu VDC in the northern
belt of Taplejung district. The outbreak has affected 7 or 8 persons
in every village of the VDC, said Ram Maya Budha Kshetri, a maternal
child health worker. "If the cases reach 12-14 in each locality, then
the outbreak will be considered epidemic," she said.

"Patients are being treated at the local level," said Budha Kshetri.
She said they have still not reported the problem to the district
hospital as they think that they can contain it on their own. Most of
the areas in the VDC have been affected by the disease.
