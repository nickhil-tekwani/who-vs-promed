[The common vectors for dengue and chikungunya are _Aedes_ mosquitoes, which are prevalent in nearly all provinces and regions, an alarming situation, as the single most significant feature for control of vector borne infections is effective vector management. Measures must be taken not at the time when a lot of infections start being reported; they have to be planned during the period of low vector activity, including measures for larval source elimination as well as public education. - Mod.UBA
