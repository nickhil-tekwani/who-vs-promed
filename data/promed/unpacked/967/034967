No fewer than 8 persons have died of probable cases of yellow fever in Ganjuwa Local Government Area of Bauchi state. There are 8 others who have also been placed under intensive care after contracting the disease.

Executive Chairman of the Bauchi State Primary Health Care Development Agency (BASPHCDA), Dr. Rilwanu Mohammed, disclosed these while briefing newsmen on Monday [9 Nov 2020].

Mohammed said the surveillance team of the agency made the discovery after taking samples of the 8 infected victims placed under intensive care. "Recently, mysterious deaths of people were reported in some villages in 2 wards of Ganjuwa LGA. Immediately our surveillance team moved in and took samples of infected victims and it was confirmed that they were yellow fever positive.

"This suspicion came from one of our supervisors who went to the local government for Polio immunisation and found out that some locals were having yellowness of the eyes and urine," he added.

There was occurrence of the disease last year [2019] where about 77 tested positive in Alkaleri, Bauchi, Toro, Ningi, Gamawa, Darazo and Warji local government areas.

[This report adds an additional state, Baushi, to the other 2 states where yellow fever (YF) cases are occurring. Bauchi state in the north of Nigeria is quite distant from Delta and Enugu states that are in the south. None of these states have adjoining borders and there is no obvious interconnectedness of their YF outbreaks. There is no indication in the above report that indicates the proportion of the population in Ganjuwa Local Government Area of Bauchi state that is vaccinated agains YF. - Mod.TY]

As Nigeria's battle against the coronavirus intensifies with fears of a 2nd wave, another deadly infectious disease is on the rise with dozens of fatalities already recorded. The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Saturday [7 Nov 2020] confirmed that reported deaths from a "strange illness" in Enugu and Delta states in recent weeks were caused by yellow fever, an acute viral haemorrhagic disease that can kill within 10 days if symptoms become severe.

Authorities in Enugu on Thursday [5 Nov 2020] said a strange ailment had killed many people with an official saying over 50 people had died in parts of the state since early September [2020] when it began spreading. Meanwhile, the government in Delta State on Friday [6 Nov 2020] confirmed that the strange disease also spreading in the state was yellow fever, according to initial investigations.

The Delta State health commissioner, Mordi Ononye, said the number of deaths recorded so far was about 22.

In a statement on Saturday [7 Nov 2020], the NCDC director, Chikwe Ihekweazu, said Delta notified the NCDC about cases presenting with symptoms of yellow fever on [2 Nov 2020], while Enugu State followed suit on [3 Nov 2020].

According to the official, most of the cases had symptoms including fever, headache, fatigue, jaundice and vomiting (with or without blood).

"As of [6 Nov 2020], 3 samples from Delta and one sample from Enugu State tested positive for Yellow Fever at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital Laboratory in Edo and the NCDC's National Reference Laboratory in Abuja."

He said the NCDC had activated an incident management system to coordinate response activities and had sent Rapid Response Teams to the 2 states. "They are carrying out active case searches, risk communications and community engagement as well as ensuring prompt management of cases, while our sister agency, the NPHCDA is planning a vaccination campaign", Mr. Ihekweazu said.

He said more samples were being tested from both states to confirm the causative organism of the outbreak. The director-general said that epidemiology teams from both states were leading the investigation with support from the NCDC, the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and the WHO.

Nigeria's earliest outbreak of yellow fever was reported in Lagos in 1864, with subsequent regular outbreaks reported until 1996. No confirmed cases were then reported for 21 years, until September 2017 when the viral infection was rediscovered in Kwara State. Since then, Nigeria has been recording thousands of infections yearly with outbreaks limited to states including Ebonyi, Cross River, Benue, Gombe, Sokoto, Kastina, Yobe, Kwara, Kogi, Osun, Edo, Bauchi, Borno, and Kano.

This year [2020], however, the disease appears to be spreading to new frontiers with the high fatality toll being recorded in Enugu and Delta. According to NCDC data detailing trends of outbreaks from 2018, 2019 and early 2020, both states only reported pockets of cases with very few deaths.

If we are to go by the 50 and 22 deaths as claimed by authorities in Enugu and Delta, it means that both states have recorded more fatalities than what was reported across Nigeria in the whole of 2019. According to NCDC data, between [1 Jan and 27 Dec 2019], Nigeria recorded 47 deaths from 38 local governments in 15 states and the FCT. Only one death was reported from the disease in 2018.

The reasons for the recent spate of new cases and increasing fatality toll in the states has not yet been medical proven but it could be because Enugu and Delta share borders with Ebonyi and Edo states respectively; 2 states that record yearly outbreaks.

In the Saturday [7 Nov 2020] statement, the NCDC said it is supporting Delta and Enugu to tackle the sudden spike in cases and deaths in some communities in the 2 states.

Vaccination
-----------
"Yellow fever is a vaccine-preventable disease. A single vaccination provides immunity for life. Symptoms of the disease include yellowness of the eyes, sudden fever, headache and body pain," the NCDC boss said in Saturday's [7 Nov 2020] statement. "The yellow fever vaccine is available for free in primary health care centres in Nigeria as part of the national childhood routine immunisation schedule," he added.

Unfortunately, the low immunization rate in the country has been a major contributing factor to the increasing prevalence of the disease in the country.

The yellow fever vaccination was introduced in Nigeria in 2004 as one of the routine vaccines expected to be given to children during routine immunisation. In spite of this, the country is still witnessing outbreaks of the disease. The increasingly regular occurrence of yellow fever outbreaks is largely because many people are unvaccinated, according to the NCDC.

The Nigerian government has in the past made concerted efforts to improve yellow fever vaccination including the introduction of yellow cards, an international certificate of vaccination or prophylaxis that shows that the holder has taken the yellow fever vaccine. However, an investigation by Devex revealed that some Nigerians are finding ways to bypass the travel requirements, increasing the risk of the epidemic-prone disease spreading to other countries.

Vaccine hesitancy -- a reluctance or refusal to be immunised -- was named by the World Health Organization as one of the top 10 threats to global health in 2019. The reasons are complex and vary by location and community, but a WHO advisory group pointed to complacency, inconvenience, and falling confidence in vaccines and health authorities as underlying causes. Left unchecked, it could undermine health gains made over many decades.

In Nigeria, poor services and a lack of knowledge about the importance of vaccines have been identified as the biggest challenges.

Yellow fever
------------
Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease that can kill within 10 days if symptoms become severe. But only a small proportion of patients who contract the virus will develop severe symptoms, according to a factsheet by the WHO. Most people do not experience symptoms, and if they do, these disappear in 3 to 4 days.

Yellow fever is difficult to diagnose, especially in the early stages. Its symptoms include jaundice or yellowing of the eyes or skin, fever, muscle pain, headache, and nausea or vomiting. The yellowing gives the disease its name. A more serious case can be confused with severe malaria or even poisoning, according to a report by Africa Check.

It is spread through bites of an infected mosquito. The species of interest are _Aedes_, which is usually black with characteristic white or silver markings on its body, and _ Haemagogus_ [this is a mosquito of South and Central America, not Africa]. These species live in different habitats and breed either around houses or in the jungle, or in both habitats, the report said.

The disease is endemic, or occurs regularly, in tropical areas of Africa and Central and South America, the WHO says. As many as 34 countries in Africa and 13 in Central and South America are either endemic or have regions that are endemic for yellow fever.

Experts say vaccination is the most effective way of preventing yellow fever.

Nigeria is part of the global campaign to eliminate yellow fever epidemics by 2026. In a national 10-year plan, some 75 million people are expected to be vaccinated by 2021. But according to WHO, only about 35 million people have been vaccinated in Nigeria.

The Enugu State Government, on Thursday [5 Nov 2020], confirmed many deaths from a yet unidentified disease in Ette Uno and Umuopu in Igbo-Eze North Local Government Area of the state. The 2 communities have recorded scores of deaths since September [2020] following the outbreak of the 'strange' disease.

A health officer in the area put the death toll at over 50, adding that specimens had been collected for proper diagnosis and treatment of other patients.

The disease, Premium Times learnt, broke out at Ette early September [2020] and spread to the border community of Umuopu, where 20 persons have died, including 4 on Wednesday [4 Nov 2020].

The source explained that the victims presented symptoms such as convulsion and diarrhoea before vomiting blood, adding that they are suspecting Lassa fever or cholera. "Between September and now, at least 37 persons have died in Ette. Also, Umuopu, which shares a common border with Ette, has recorded 20 deaths, 4 of which happened yesterday. It has been a strange development.

"The state Ministry of Health has been notified and investigations are currently ongoing to unravel the cause of the deaths. We have collected samples from the affected people and we are looking out for Lassa fever, cholera, yellow fever and meningitis. Coronavirus tests will equally start in the affected communities today. The state's Ministry of Health has brought an ambulance we are using to convey the sick ones to Enugu for proper diagnosis and treatment," the source, who pleaded anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media, said.

The source further said that a 30-year-old student of the University of Nigeria Nsukka, CO, 40-year-old EEO and 47-year-old SE were among the 20 casualties at Umuopu community

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is currently supporting the Delta and Enugu State Governments, in response to suspected outbreak of yellow fever. This is following reports of a sudden spike in cases and deaths in some communities in both states.

On 2 and 3 Nov 2020, NCDC was notified by the State Ministries of Health of Delta and Enugu States respectively, of cases presenting with symptoms indicative of a viral haemorrhagic fever. Most cases presented with fever, headache, fatigue, jaundice vomiting (with or without blood) among others.

As at 6 Nov 2020, 3 samples from Delta and one sample from Enugu tested positive for yellow fever at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital Laboratory and NCDC's National Reference Laboratory, Gaduwa. More samples are being tested from both states to confirm the causative organism of this outbreak.

The State Epidemiology Teams are leading the response with support from NCDC, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and the World Health Organization (WHO). An incident management system has been activated by NCDC to coordinate response activities and Rapid Response Teams (RRT) have been deployed to both states. The NCDC and State RRTs are carrying out active case search, risk communications and community engagement as well as ensuring prompt management of cases. Our sister agency, NPHCDA is working with the affected states to plan for a vaccination campaign.
