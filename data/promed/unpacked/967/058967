A Georgia dog is believed to be the 2nd in the country to positive for the virus causing COVID-19, the state Department of Public Health (DPH) said Wednesday [1 Jul 2020].

The owners of the 6-year-old mixed breed dog tested positive for the coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2], the DPH said. But the dog did not have any evidence of respiratory disease. The animal did have a sudden onset of neurological illness, which progressed quickly over a matter of days, health officials said. The dog was humanely euthanized.

"Out of an abundance of caution, a SARS-CoV-2 test was performed on the dog, the DPH said. "The presumptive positive result was confirmed by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory. While the dog did test positive for SARS-CoV-2, the progressive neurological illness was caused by another condition."

The state DPH worked in collaboration with the Georgia Department of Agriculture, the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine, the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of Agriculture to confirm the case.

A 2nd dog in the home was also tested, but those results are pending. The 2nd dog was not showing any signs, health officials said.

The 1st US case of an animal testing positive for COVID-19 was a tiger at a NY zoo, according to the CDC. A small number of pet cats have tested positive for the virus, which was also discovered in mink on multiple farms in the Netherlands [and now in Denmark as well], the CDC said.

On 2 Jun 2020, the USDA said a German shepherd in New York state was the 1st in the US to test positive for the coronavirus.

Despite the animals having tested positive, there is no evidence animals play a significant role in spreading the virus causing COVID-19, according to the CDC.

If you have COVID-19 and have pets
----------------------------------
People who test positive for COVID-19 should take precautions if they have pets in the household, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health.
- When possible, have another member of your household care for your pets while you are sick.
- Avoid contact with your pet including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, sharing food, and sleeping in the same bed.
- If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with them.

[There is no evidence that companion animals can transmit the disease to humans. Nevertheless, caution is urged. Likewise, take care of you pets as clearly we can transmit this virus to them.

An excellent article is found in COVID-19 update (231): USA (NY) animal, dog conf. 20200602.7420541. - Mod.TG

It will be interesting to see if the household's 2nd dog mentioned in the article above tests positive or not. The 2nd dog was asymptomatic, but on the other hand the 1st dog's neurological symptoms were ascribed to a different cause, so that it presumably did not show symptoms from the test-positive coronavirus infection. - Mod.LXL
