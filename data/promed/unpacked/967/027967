1st detection of _Chlamydia trachomatis_ LGV biovar in the Czech Republic, 2010-2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[authors: Vanousova D, Zakoucka H, Jilich D, et al]

We present 4 cases of proctitis in HIV-infected men having sex with men (MSM) living in the Czech Republic. The causative agent in all cases was the lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) biovar of _Chlamydia trachomatis_. The spread of proctitis caused by _C. trachomatis_ serovars L1-3 among MSM has been observed in several European countries, the United States, and Canada since 2003. To our knowledge, no LGV cases in Eastern Europe have been published to date.

Between February 2010 and February 2011, 4 MSM infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), who were under regular observation for HIV infection at the Bulovka University Hospital AIDS Center in Prague, Czech Republic, developed symptoms of acute proctitis. The most prominent symptom in all 4 patients was intensive rectal pain lasting on average 10 days (range: 7-21 days). Other symptoms included blood in the stool or pinkish mucous discharge, constipation, and tenesmus. Case 1 also had one enlarged, painful inguinal lymph node. Anoscopies were performed on case 1 and case 3 and revealed congested, irritated mucous membranes with a whitish coating. None of the patients had urethritis, fever, or other systemic symptoms (Table: see URL above).

To our knowledge, these cases are the 1st LGV infections detected in the region.

Background
----------
Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by _Chlamydia trachomatis_ serovars L1-3 [1]. Rare in industrialised countries, LGV is most often restricted to Africa, Asia, South America, and the Caribbean [1,2]. Outbreaks of LGV proctitis in HIV-infected MSM have, been reported, however, in several European countries, the United States, and Canada [3-9]. Infections with LGV serovars, mainly L2, have been reported in North America and in Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Sweden, but to the best of our knowledge, there have been no publications to date reporting cases in Eastern Europe.

Clinical and behavioural information
------------------------------------
Three cases were regular visitors of gay clubs where they repeatedly had protected receptive anal intercourse with casual partners, but also used sex toys without condoms. One case reported having had unprotected anal sex and used sex toys with only one partner during the year before diagnosis. The identity and possible symptoms of the partner remain unknown to us. All but one of the cases were taking combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and their mean CD4+ T cell count was 540/microL (range: 414-602/microL). Their median age was 46 years (range: 39-47 years) and the average time since the diagnosis of HIV infection was 27.75 months (range: 9-39 months). 3 of them had already been treated for one episode of STD in the past (Table).

Laboratory investigation
------------------------
Rectal swabs were taken from all cases for culture and PCR for _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ and for PCR for _C. trachomatis_ (Cobas CT/NG, Roche). All cases were screened serologically for syphilis. The PCR tests for _C. trachomatis_ were positive in all 4 cases. In case 1, PCR was also positive for _N. gonorrhoeae_. The samples positive for _C. trachomatis_ were stored at -80 deg C [-112 deg F] for further identification of the LGV genotype, which became available in the Czech Republic in May 2011.

The LGV genotype was identified by PCR amplification of a 262 bp fragment of target DNA using the dual-priming oligonucleotide primers (DPO) test. This method targets the pmp-H gene and enables simultaneous detection of LGV-serovars and differentiation of L1-3 from other serovars [10].

Treatment
---------
Therapy with oral azithromycin 1 g once per week for 3 weeks was started in case 1, who had been concomitantly diagnosed with a _N. gonorrhoeae_ infection. The anorectal symptoms resolved, but the lymph node abscessed and needed to be punctured. The puncture was also PCR-positive for _C. trachomatis_. A consecutive treatment with oral doxycycline, 100 mg twice per day for 5 weeks, was started, with the enlarged lymph node eventually regressing after this therapy. The other 3 cases were treated with oral doxycycline, 100 mg twice per day for 14 to 21 days, and in all of them the symptoms resolved during the therapy. The post-treatment rectal swabs for PCR of _C. trachomatis_ were negative in all 4 patients. The Table [see URL above] summarises details of the patients' risk factors, clinical symptoms, and therapy.

Discussion and conclusions
--------------------------
The Czech cases of LGV infection were very similar to the cases reported both in North America and Western Europe [4]. All cases were HIV-infected MSM who used sex toys; 3 of them had had numerous sexual contacts. Furthermore, the clinical symptoms were very similar and their intensity corresponded to what is typical for LGV proctitis [11]. Although the method we used to identify LGV DNA cannot differentiate between L1, L2, and L3 genotypes, it distinguishes L1-3 from other serovars; the presence of the LGV infections in the region of Eastern Europe is therefore evident.

The recommended therapy for LGV proctitis is oral doxycycline, 100 mg orally twice per day for 3 weeks [12]. 2 of our cases were treated with the recommended dose of doxycycline, but only for 2 weeks. This shorter regimen was chosen because the LGV aetiology was not known, as the method for the identification of LGV biovars was introduced in the Czech Republic in May 2011. Nevertheless, even the 2-week therapy with doxycycline proved effective enough in our cases.

The increased frequency of identification of LGV serotypes of _C. trachomatis_ in developed countries in recent years is certainly connected to the introduction of modern molecular diagnostic methods into routine practice; on the other hand, it also closely correlates with the rapid increase in the incidence of syphilis among MSM in the same regions, including the Czech Republic [13-15]. This situation probably demonstrates decreasing awareness on the part of MSM about the risk of transmission of STDs. The frequent use of sex toys among patients with LGV proctitis indicates that these objects may play an important role in the transmission of LGV biovars of _C. trachomatis_ [16,17].

This new epidemiological situation requires thorough analysis in order to adapt interventional strategies especially for population groups at particular risk such as HIV-infected MSM. Active case finding and contact tracing for LGV infection should be included in routine healthcare for such high-risk populations.

In addition, the cases described here document that the spread of LGV strains of _C. trachomatis_ has reached Eastern Europe, and further reports of the identification of this pathogen in this region can be expected soon after the introduction of appropriate diagnostic methods in this region.

Lymphogranuloma venereum: a hidden emerging problem, Barcelona, 2011
--------------------------------------------------------------------
[authors: Vargas-Leguas H, Garcia de Olalla P, Arando M, et al]

From the beginning of 2007 until the end of 2011, 146 cases of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) were notified to the Barcelona Public Health Agency. Some 49 per cent of them were diagnosed and reported in 2011, mainly in men who have sex with men [MSM]. Almost half of them, 32 cases, were reported between July and September. This cluster represents the largest since 2004. This article presents the ongoing outbreak of LGV in Barcelona.

Surveillance
------------
LGV surveillance in Barcelona is part of the sexually transmitted infections (STI) register, which has been active since 2007 and collects information about diagnoses in individuals tested in public or private facilities. Clinicians complete a standard data questionnaire to collect demographic, clinical, and epidemiological key parameters, including date of consultation, sex, year of birth, sexual orientation, testing for HIV, previous STIs, and sexual behaviour.

All data were collected by the Barcelona STI registry and were handled in a strictly confidential manner according to the requirements of the Spanish data protection law [1].

_Chlamydia trachomatis_ was detected by nucleic acid amplification tests. Positive samples were then confirmed with a 2nd real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction that allows differentiation of serovars A-K from the L serovars [2].

Epidemiological data
--------------------
After 2 decades without LGV notifications, a new case was diagnosed in Barcelona in 2004. It was a homosexual man who was a sexual partner of a case diagnosed in Amsterdam [3]. No further cases were detected in Barcelona until September 2007.

The median number of cases reported per month increased from 2 in 2010 to 6 in 2011. A comparison of data from the period 2007-2010 with the year 2011 showed that patients in 2011 were younger (p=0.01) and more of them had documented HIV infection (Table: see URL above).

Of the 70 cases of LGV reported in 2011 that were resident in Barcelona, all were MSM, at least 66 were HIV-positive (HIV status was unknown in 2 cases), and 39 cases were born in Spain, 17 in South America, 12 in other countries of Western Europe and North America, and one in another region. In 4 cases, HIV diagnosis was known at the time of the LGV diagnosis, and 22 of the cases were diagnosed with another STI in the previous 12 months. _C. trachomatis_ was detected in the anal or perianal region in 67 cases, in the genital area in 2 cases, and for one case no data were available. Regarding the presence of symptoms, 64 cases had at least one symptom, 2 cases were asymptomatic, and in 3 cases this information was not recorded.

The time between the onset of the symptoms and the diagnosis ranged from 2 to 530 days, with a median of 29 days.

The mean number of new sexual partners in the 12 months before diagnosis was 26 (range: 1-100) for the 31 cases in 2011 for whom this information was obtained. Only 4 cases reported using a condom in the most recent sexual relationship, and 3 cases engaged in casual sexual intercourse while abroad. For the 27 patients whose information on location of sexual activity was available, 10 reported having had numerous sexual partners, at home or at private parties. The majority of these contacts had been established anonymously by Internet and some of them by mobile applications based on geolocation.

Control measures
----------------
To deal with the increase in LGV cases, control measures were implemented in Barcelona from September 2011: alerting STI clinics, HIV specialists and hospitals of the existence of the current outbreak of LGV; active case finding in clinical care units and microbiology laboratories; contact with patients to monitor treatment and implement partner notification; preventive activities targeting risk groups with the collaboration of non-governmental organisations.

Discussion and conclusion
-------------------------
This cluster represents the largest cluster of LGV cases since 2004. A previous outbreak in Barcelona, reported in 2008, had 18 cases in the course of 7 months [4].

LGV is an emerging sexually transmitted infection in Europe and in North America. Occasionally, clusters of cases suggest ongoing low-level transmission in these areas [5]. However, since the 1st outbreak was reported in the Netherlands in 2003, new cases have been reported regularly in various European countries [6-12]. Since 2010, the United Kingdom reported an increase in cases of LGV to over 550 cases, most of them in London. The Netherlands reported 66 cases in 2010 [13,14].

Certain characteristics of LGV support the concept that it is a hidden disease: it affects vulnerable groups, is often self-treated, and misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is common. Early diagnosis and treatment of cases are very important because the period of communicability can vary from weeks to years, as long as active lesions are present [15].

As in other parts of Europe, the significant increase in cases of LGV in Barcelona in the last year affected the MSM population, most of them HIV-infected. The infrequent use of condoms in the last years and the high proportion of anonymous sexual contacts make this group active transmitters of STIs, including HIV. Clinicians, epidemiologists, and those most susceptible to infection such as MSM, should be aware that this disease is still present in European countries, and that it could manifest in a gradual increase in cases or as outbreaks. Existing efforts to promote awareness and prevention of LGV, especially among HIV-infected patients and among physicians, should be strengthened. New technologies (such as Internet, global positioning system) favour risk practices, but also provide opportunities for new prevention strategies. These new media could be used to disseminate information about preventive measures and, in the case of applications using georeferences, to facilitate the identification of contacts and tracing of patients with LGV who would benefit from timely notification. Some publications have welcomed this initiative aimed at groups of MSM who seek sexual contacts through websites [16,17]. Other experiences in STI centres, such as human sexuality seminars for MSM have proven effective in reducing risk practices in this group [18].

Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria that rely on host cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for energy production. Chlamydia have 2 forms: a non-replicating, infectious elementary body, analogous to a spore, and a replicating, non-infectious reticulate body. The elementary body induces its own endocytosis upon attachment to host cells, within which the elementary body converts to the replicating reticulate form. Up to several hundred progeny are produced within a large cytoplasmic inclusion. The reticulate body then reverts to the elementary form and is released by the cell through exocytosis.

_Chlamydia trachomatis_ is transmitted through infected secretions, and infects mainly columnar epithelial cells, particularly in the cervix, rectum, urethra, throat, and conjunctiva.

Within the _C. trachomatis_ species, there are multiple serovars. The diseases caused by _C. trachomatis_ depend on the serovar: serovars A, B, Ba, and C cause trachoma; serovars D through K cause genital and perinatal infections; and serovars L1, L2, and L3 cause lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV).

LGV is spread by anal, oral, or vaginal sex without a condom. Transmission may also occur through sharing sex toys. Symptoms can occur between 3 to 30 days after infection. Small painless papules or ulcers may appear at the site of infection (in the rectum, penis, vagina, or mouth and may go unnoticed if the ulcer is in a place that is not visible. LGV spreads from the initial site of inoculation, such as, urethra, rectum, cervix, or throat, to the regional lymph nodes through lymphatic drainage pathways. Swelling and redness of the skin overlying the enlarged, tender regional lymph nodes, such as in the groin area, may occur, followed in some patients by suppurative lymphadenitis and drainage through the skin from the involved lymph nodes. Painful bowel movements and urge to defecate (tenesmus) accompanied by blood, mucus, or pus from the rectum (or in the stools) may occur, especially among those who practice receptive anal intercourse. Untreated, LGV can cause chronic drainage and scarring, chronic swelling of the genitals, strictures, and infertility.

Like other ulcerative venereal diseases, LGV enhances transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Many patients with LGV were reportedly HIV-positive, which indicates an increase of risky sexual practices among MSM.

It is likely that the cases identified represent only a small fraction of the cases that have actually occurred. Diagnostic laboratory methods may not be readily available and without such assays, many LGV cases are misdiagnosed as common chlamydial urogenital infection. CDC STD Treatment Guidelines recommend the use of doxycycline, twice a day for 21 days. Alternative treatments are erythromycin or azithromycin. The CDC notes that persons with both LGV and HIV infection should receive the same LGV treatment as those who are HIV-negative. Prolonged therapy may be required, and delay in resolution of symptoms may occur among persons with HIV (http://www.cdc.gov/std/lgv/stdfact-lgv.htm). - Mod.ML
