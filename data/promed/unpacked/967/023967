Avian influenza infection was confirmed Sunday [13 Mar 2011] among
chickens at a poultry farm in Chiba city, marking the 1st such case
in the Kanto region centering on Tokyo, the Chiba prefectural government said.

Local authorities began culling about 35 000 birds at the farm and
restricted the movements of another 869 000 birds being raised within
a 10-km radius of the farm in question.

"This is a very severe situation, as damage from the huge earthquake
is also serious," Chiba Gov. Kensaku Morita said at a press
conference, referring to the powerful quake that struck northeastern
and eastern Japan on Friday [11 Mar 2011].

A total of 4 birds were found dead at the Chiba farm on Friday and
Saturday [11-12 Mar 2011], and a genetic test confirmed that 4 out of
7 birds checked were infected by a highly pathogenic strain of bird
flu virus, local government officials said.

Chiba is Japan's 2nd-largest chicken egg producing prefecture.
