RABIES, FELINE - ARGENTINA (BUENOS AIRES) ex BAT (03)

[Commenting on the 5 May 2008 ProMED-mail post (archive no.
20080505.1543) that the number of pets in Buenos Aires was 425 978
canines in the city and more than double the number of cats in the
city, at 206 710, Merritt Clifton provided the following comments [edited].]

Assuming these figures are for the actual city of Buenos Aires, not
including suburbs, the human population is 2 776 138; this works out
to one dog per 6.5 people, a high ratio by global standards, but
trailing the U.S., Costa Rica, and China, the nations where dogs are
most popular as pets.

Nations where most dogs live on the streets have considerably lower
ratios. India may have had as many as one dog per 10 people before
the start of the national Animal Birth Control program in 1998, but
is now down to about one dog per 40 people nationwide, and one per
160 people in the cities with the most vigorous ABC programs.

In short, the Buenos Aires dog numbers suggest that most of the dogs
are well-cared-for pets, with a high likelihood of being vaccinated.
[Perhaps less than one might assume. See figures below, which suggest
that many may not be. - Mod.TY]

The cats-to-humans ratio would be one pet cat per 13.4 people. That
is of concern, because it is low enough to suggest that cats are
perhaps more likely to be feral and living at large than living in homes.

Assuming that the habitat niche for feral cats is approximately the
same as for other modern cities, not otherwise occupied by street
dogs and wild urban predators such as coyotes, foxes, hawks, owls,
and eagles, and knowing that there is no major program in Buenos
Aires for sterilizing feral cats, I would make an educated guess that
the feral cat population of the city is at least equal to the owned
cat population.

What this means to rabies control is that you have about 200 000
unvaccinated feral cats out there who are potentially at risk. And if
you imagine that they can be exterminated with any degree of success,
bear in mind that the U.S. killed upward of 10 million cats per year
for several decades while the feral cat population continued to rise,
from about 30 million according to Marbanks in 1950 to about 40
million circa 1991, when I did my 1st estimate using similar methods.

Once trap-neuter-vaccinate-return [TNVR] caught on, in the early
1990s, the numbers fell like a rock, to about 26 million by 1996, and
then plateaued circa 2003 at about 6.5 million winter, 12.5 million
in midsummer (which is about a 3rd of the total U.S. free-roaming cat
population. The rest are pets.) Cat-killing in U.S. animal shelters
fell to about 2 million per year during the same time.

TNVR can build a strong vaccinated barrier between rabid animal and
owned pets, as several of us demonstrated in northern Fairfield
County, Connecticut in 1991-1992, and as I described in my very first
ProMed post circa 1996. But it does have to be done in a focused,
sustained, monitored manner, to be absolutely sure of treating at
least 70-80 percent of the cats in every zone of potential risk.

[ProMED thanks Merritt Clifton for these interesting and informative
comments. His comment that cats, especially feral ones, should
receive significant attention in rabies prevention is especially
important. Although pet dogs and cats may be kept mainly indoors,
they are not completely free of risk of rabies exposure, especially
from bats which can and do enter buildings, and have been a source of
rabies exposure for pet dogs and cats as well as people. Of concern,
a related article in La Nacion of Argentina (in Spanish,
<http://www.lanacion.com.ar/archivo/nota.asp?nota_id=1004468&origen=acumulado&acumulado_id=>
published on 15 Apr 2008, indicated that there are 190 000 dog and
cats not vaccinated against rabies. This suggests that the pet-owning
public in Buenos Aires needs education about the risk of rabies.

Also, please note that the comment in the previous post (archive no.
20080505.1543) concerning the pet census was referred to as from Rio
de Janeiro by mistake, rather than Buenos Aires. ProMED regrets any
confusion this may have caused. - Mod.TY]
