WEST NILE VIRUS UPDATE 2004 - USA (08)

[This will be the final single-country West Nile virus update. It is
clear from the foregoing and preceding updates that West Nile virus
is now enzootic/endemic throughout most of the United States and
adjacent regions of Canada and Mexico. Furthermore, different
criteria adopted for West Nile virus surveillance in different
states/provinces/administrative regions, and to some extent different
levels of reporting zeal, are making direct comparisons of data
problematic. Henceforth the individual country updates will be
combined as a "West Nile virus update - Western hemisphere" to
accommodate the probable southwards movement of the virus in the
coming months. Henceforth the updates will focus on significant new
developments, such as extensions of geographic range, involvement of
novel hosts, changes in virulence/pathogenicity, etc. The updates may
be supplemented by an overall situation report compiled from national
statistics where these are available. - Mod.CP]

Arizona (West): 1st human Case of West Nile Virus Infection in 2004
-------------------------------------------------
Arizona reported this year's 1st human cases of the mosquito-borne
West Nile virus, health officials said. On Wed 26 May 2004 New Mexico
reported its 1st human case. At a news conference Thu 27 May 2004,
Dr. Jonathan Weisbuch, director of the Maricopa County Department of
Public Health, said an adult from the county developed symptoms 8 May
2004 and was admitted to a hospital. Weisbuch said that person has
now fully recovered.
In all, 8 residents from Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix,
contracted the virus in 2003, but only one was infected within the
county, Weisbuch said. That case -- a person who became ill in
September 2003 and has now recovered -- was confirmed by the CDC as
West Nile virus infected earlier this month.
Arizona's mosquito season usually runs from August through September
after the monsoon rains, and "this is much earlier than we expected,"
Weisbuch said. "It's going to be a longer season. We could see
several hundred cases," he said.
Dr. Amy Bode, a medical epidemiologist for the Division of
Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases at the CDC laboratory in Fort
Collins, Colo., warned against predictions. "The 2nd year is not
necessarily (the worst) but it can be," she said. "The states should
try to be ready and take precautions."
West Nile, which first hit the United States in 1999 in New York, has
killed more than 560 people in the United States in the past 5 years.
Last year was the first for West Nile to appear in areas west of the
Continental Divide. Colorado led the nation last year with 2947 of
9862 human cases reported to the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. The disease resulted in 61 deaths in that state.

California: West Nile Virus Found in 157 Dead Birds
-------------------------------------------------
The count of West Nile virus-infected wild birds shot up dramatically
on Fri 28 May 2004 with state health officials reporting 157 dead
birds, mostly crows, from San Bernardino, Riverside and Los Angeles
counties testing positive for the potentially dangerous virus. The
state found 75 infected birds in San Bernardino County, 60 in mostly
eastern Los Angeles County and 22 in western Riverside County. The
numbers of West Nile-positive birds in the region jumped from only 6
(2 weeks ago) to 36 last week, to nearly 160 on Friday. "There's
definitely an epidemic in the bird population," said Ken Fujioka with
the San Gabriel Valley Mosquito and Vector Control District.
Infected dead birds were found in 38 cities including Ontario,
Claremont, Rialto, Fontana, Rubidoux, Riverside and Norco, as well as
towns as far east as Redlands and west into the San Gabriel Valley.
The highest concentration of birds were found in Fontana, Rialto and
San Bernardino.
During 2003, the CDC confirmed nearly 10 000 human cases of West Nile
fever nationwide, with 264 deaths. Horses and members of the corvid
bird family, such as crows, ravens and jays, and some raptors, are
especially vulnerable to West Nile. As of Friday, the state reported
no human or equine cases. The dead birds testing positive for the
West Nile virus on Friday included 153 American crows, 2 scrub jays,
one common raven and one black phoebe. The higher infected bird count
indicates the virus is prevalent in the area, Cheng said. "The chance
of being bitten by an infected mosquito is higher now."

Virginia: First Equine Case of West Nile Virus Infection in 2004
---------------------------------------------------
A 6-year-old thoroughbred mare in Culpeper County was euthanized
after contracting West Nile virus (WNV), the 1st case of the disease
in a Virginia horse this year, the state Department of Agriculture
and Consumer Services said on Fri 28 May 2004. Symptoms first
appeared on 1 May 2004, earlier than any of the previously reported
cases of West Nile in Virginia. The earliest previous case was on 15
Jul 2003.
"Even though it is very unusual to see a positive case this early in
the season, it is not too late to vaccinate your horse for WNV," said
Joe Garvin, head of the agriculture department's laboratory services
office.
West Nile vaccine for horses requires 2 doses administered 3-6 weeks
apart. The vaccine takes 4-6 weeks from the 2nd dose to be effective.

Pndiana: West Nile Virus-infected Mosquitoes Found Earlier than Previously
--------------------------------------------------
The 1st pool of mosquitoes in Indiana infected with the West Nile
virus has been found earlier than in previous years, health officials
said on Fri 29 May 2004. The infected mosquitoes were found in traps
on the north side of Indianapolis, a location where the virus also
was detected last year, the Marion County Health Department said.
"The recent warm conditions combined with the rain we have had during
the last couple of weeks has increased our mosquito counts," said Jim
Erwin, the department's mosquito control biologist.
The virus was first detected among animals in Indiana during 2001,
and the state recorded 293 confirmed human cases of West Nile virus
infection and 11 deaths in 2002. But with several heavy storms last
summer flushing away mosquito eggs in septic ponds, roadside catch
basins and other breeding sites, only 47 cases and 4 deaths were
reported in the state.
