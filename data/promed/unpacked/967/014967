The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS), the Minnesota Department of Health, and local health departments are investigating an increase of _Cyclospora_ infections.

To date, 11 ill patients in Wisconsin and 3 in Minnesota have reported purchasing a vegetable tray from a Wisconsin or Minnesota Kwik Trip location before their illness. The La Crosse, Wisconsin-based Kwik Trip, and Kwik Star is a chain of convenience stores founded in 1965 with locations throughout Wisconsin and Minnesota under the name Kwik Trip, and in northeast Iowa under the name Kwik Star.

The Del Monte vegetable trays sold at Kwik Trip contained broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and dill dip and may have been available at other retail locations. Further details on distribution are pending.

Consumers should not eat the following products:
- Del Monte Vegetable Tray (containing broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and dill dip) 6 oz.
- Del Monte Vegetable Tray (containing broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and dill dip) 12 oz.

Kwik Trip is cooperating with state officials and voluntarily removed this product from their stores.

_Cyclospora_ is a parasite commonly found in developing countries. People diagnosed with this infection in the US often report having traveled; however, during the summer months, outbreaks and illnesses occur as a result of contaminated fresh produce entering the US food market from endemic countries.

Symptoms of _Cyclospora_ infection include:
Frequent watery diarrhea, loss of appetite and weight, cramping, bloating, and/or increased gas, nausea (vomiting is less frequent), fatigue, low-grade fever.

Anyone experiencing any one of these symptoms should see a healthcare provider who can provide appropriate treatment. It may take a week after consuming the product for symptoms to begin. State health officials are continuing to conduct interviews with individuals who test positive for _Cyclospora_. Ill consumers are also encouraged to contact their local health department.

[Outbreaks of infections with _Cyclospora cayetanensis_, cyclosporiasis, are almost always due to lettuces contaminated at the site of production. This explains that outbreaks are often seen simultaneously at many geographically dispersed sites.

In this case it seems that the source has already been identified and the product recalled. - Mod.EP
