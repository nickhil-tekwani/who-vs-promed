[1] Egypt (Cairo): avian influenza H5N1 WHO delegation

An international delegation from the World Health Organization (WHO) is due in Cairo mid-March [2015] to discuss ways to tackle Egypt's endemic outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza, health minister Adel Adawy announced [Sun 1 Mar 2015].

The international experts, in collaboration with the health ministry, will work on developing a strategy to ensure the eradication of the H5N1 avian influenza virus in Egypt in a short time, Adawy was quoted by Youm7 [Sun 1 Mar 2015]. The delegation will be headed by Dr Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general of the (WHO) for Health Security Affairs, according to Adawy.

In 2006, Egypt reported the 1st avian influenza case, and since then new outbreaks have occurred every year, "making it one of the world's few endemic countries for the virus with a case fatality rate of 36 per cent," according to a WHO report. Egypt is one of the 6 nations suffering from an outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza alongside Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, and Viet Nam, the report added.

On 14 Feb [2015], a 35 year old man died of H5N1 avian flu in Cairo, marking the 11th death in the country from the disease in 2015, according to the Health Ministry. The death toll reached 10 in 2014.

Most avian flu cases in Egypt have been detected in impoverished rural areas, where villagers traditionally raise poultry on the rooftops of their homes to supplement their diet, Ahmed Abdel Hamed, a former health ministry official previously told Youm7.

[The reports of numbers of cases and deaths in 2015 in Egypt are discrepant among various groups reporting, with Egyptian authorities listing the fewest cases. Egypt Independent, as reported by ProMED-mail Avian influenza, human (55): Egypt (FY) H5N1, virus volatility, preparedness 20150226.3195148, noted the 14th death from H5N1 that recently occurred in Fayoum. In this post, the Health Ministry refers to a 14 Feb 2015 death as the 11th. FluTrackers (https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/egypt/h5n1-tracking-egypt/720309-egypt-2015-who-moh-provincial-health-depts-h5n1-confirmed-case-list) lists 75 cases of H5N1 in Egypt since 1 Jan 2015 with 20 deaths to date. WHO, expressing concern over H5N1 infections in Egypt, noted, "The sudden increase in the number of H5N1 human infections in Egypt that began in November 2014 and continued during January and February 2015 awakened concern. From the start of November 2014 to 23 Feb 2015, Egypt reported 108 human cases and 35 deaths. The number of cases over this period is larger than yearly totals reported by any country since human H5N1 virus infections re-emerged in late 2003.

According to FAO, a total of 76 outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza were detected in 20 of Egypt's 27 governorates between 18 Jan 2015 and 7 Feb 2015. Of these outbreaks, the majority -- 66 -- occurred in household poultry. (See WHO http://www.who.int/influenza/publications/warningsignals201502/en/).

Regardless of the exact number of cases, there is serious cause for concern over H5N1. It is a good sign that Egypt is addressing the threat this virus poses, but eradication is a lofty goal, especially in a short time, as health minister Adel Adawy proclaimed as the goal. - Mod.LK]

[2] Egypt: WHO warning H5 strains

WHO warns of pandemics worse than 2009 swine flu outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------
The world is highly vulnerable to a severe flu pandemic and governments should increase surveillance, vigilance and preparedness, WHO has said. "Nothing about influenza is predictable -- including where the next pandemic might emerge and which virus might be responsible," the United Nations health agency warned while noting the next pandemic could be worse than the 2009 swine flu outbreak that killed over 284 000.

This year's [2015] seasonal flu season has been bad in many parts of the world, with Asia, the Americas, and Europe reporting high levels of circulating flu viruses and low levels of protection from vaccines that did not match the relevant strains.

The health organisation is particularly concerned about avian influenza noting that the diversity and geographical distribution of influenza viruses currently circulating in wild and domestic birds are unprecedented. "The world needs to be concerned," it said.

The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, which has been causing poultry outbreaks in Asia almost continuously since 2003 and is now endemic in several countries, is the influenza virus of greatest concern for human health. Over the past 2 years, H5N1 has been joined by newly detected H5N2, H5N3, H5N6, and H5N8 strains, all of which are currently circulating in different parts of the world.

Praising virological research that had increased capability to detect, understand, and assess new viruses for pandemic risk, and to track their international spread, WHO noted that this has to be stepped up. More antiviral medicines, including peramivir and laninamivir as well as oseltamivir and zanamivir, are now available to treat influenza and reduce the duration and severity of infection. But better vaccines and shorter production times are required. More people would die in the 3 to 4 months currently needed to manufacture vaccines.
