A horse in Weld County, Colorado, has been diagnosed with West Nile virus (WNV). This is the 1st confirmed case of WNV in a horse in Colorado in 2016. This index case was diagnosed by Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Fort Collins.

Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3 to 6 week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents. "Strict insect control is an important factor to inhibit the transmission of West Nile virus," said state veterinarian Keith Roehr, DVM. "I encourage livestock owners to keep an eye out for standing water for mosquito populations."

West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 per cent.

The clinical signs of WNV can be consistent with other important neurologic diseases such as equine encephalitis, rabies, and equine herpesvirus; therefore it is important to work with your veterinarian to get an accurate diagnosis through laboratory testing.

A horse in Cayuga County, New York, has died after testing positive for West Nile virus (WNV), the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on 5 Aug [2016] "An unvaccinated 8 year old stallion was diagnosed with WNV earlier this week," the EDCC statement said.

The EDCC said the owner first noticed clinical signs on 25 Jul [2016]. The horse was holding his head in a fixed, low position and developed fever, ataxia (incoordination), and blindness, the statement said. Despite veterinary treatment, the horse's condition worsened and he was euthanized on 27 Jul [2016]. Tests for Eastern equine encephalitis and rabies were negative, the statement said.

West Nile is transmitted...

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines...

In addition to vaccinations...

[The message is the same from both state veterinarians, so I will not repeat it except if you haven't, get your horse(s) vaccinated.
