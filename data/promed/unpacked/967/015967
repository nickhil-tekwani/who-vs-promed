An outbreak of infectious salmon anemia (ISA) is suspected on a farm in the locality Hjellberget 10808, Kvaenangen, Troms.

The locality is a sea farm owned by Joekelfjord Laks. Any person entering the ocean in the area must show due care so that the disease is not spread.

The Veterinary Institute notified the Food Safety Authority of its suspicion of ISA at the farm after increased mortality and positive laboratory findings for ISA.

Restrictions on the movement of fish have now been applied.

[According to the text, there have been positive lab tests, so it is unclear why the disease is not as yet confirmed. There is an ongoing outbreak further south (in Nordland; see ProMED-mail posting 20140304.2313363). ISA is a disease of Atlantic salmons (_Salmo salar_) caused by an orthomyxovirus, which affects mainly fish maintained in marine water or exposed to the sea. The disease can be systemic and lethal, characterized by severe anemia and hemorrhages in several organs. It is a disease of great economic impact for the salmon industry. The disease is of obligatory notification to the OIE.
