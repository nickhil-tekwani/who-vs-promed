Eight persons are under quarantine and a slaughterhouse has been
temporary closed after a bovine was infected with anthrax in
Nichiteni in Botosani county in eastern Romania. The animal's owner
called in veterinarians after the animal got sick and died. The
persons in contact with the anthrax-infected animal are under
quarantine. Local authorities say all precautions have been taken so
that this isolated case does not result in the spread of the disease.

[Anthrax is sporadic in Romania occurring either in the south east in
Tulcea and Constanta, or in the north east sector of Bistrita-Nasaud,
Suceava, Botosani, Neamt, and Vaslui counties. These usually involve
just cattle and sheep, but occasionally overspill into pigs and
horses. Human cases occur at the rate of 2-3 per year.

Reading between the lines of this report the veterinarian was
contracted after the animal carcass had been taken to the local
slaughterhouse, and, by the time he saw it, the carcass had been
skinned. One can understand the consistency in annual human incidence.
