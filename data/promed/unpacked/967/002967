Northern Ireland's 1st case of bovine foetal deformity due to Schmallenberg virus [SBV] in 2018 has been confirmed in a stillborn calf from a Co. Fermanagh herd.

So far this year [2018], the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) has confirmed 29 cases of SBV in sheep in all 6 counties of Northern Ireland.

SBV is not a notifiable disease in Northern Ireland. However, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) advises farmers to contact their vet if they suspect the presence of the disease in their cattle or sheep.

Farmers were urged to be on high alert after the disease seemed to be spreading north [see comment] but, at this late stage, there is little they can do.

Symptoms of the virus include:
Bent limbs or fixed joints;
Curved spine;
Fixed necks;
'Dummy lambs' - alive; but can be blind, unable to stand or suck, and may have seizures;
Abortions.

Controlling The Disease
Schmallenberg 1st hit Irish shores in 2012. It was transported by midges and affected flocks mainly in the southern and eastern parts of the country.

A vaccine is available and will not impact farmers' ability to trade their animals within the EU. However, this must be applied before pregnancy to take effect.

As Schmallenberg virus is not a notifiable disease, there are currently no movement restrictions in place and no controls are required.

There are no human health implications associated with the disease, nor any food safety implications.

More information on the disease is available on the department's website.

[Re "Farmers were urged to be on high alert after the disease seemed to be spreading north": in fact, the infection is not spreading currently but had spread during late 2017, when sheep and cattle were infected simultaneously by the culicoides vectors. Sheep, due to their relatively short pregnancy (5 months, compared to 9 in cattle) were the 1st to demonstrate deformed offspring at the termination of their pregnancy (resulting from the infection of their developing foeti) - earlier than pregnant cows, currently giving birth to their infected and hence deformed calves.

It deserves to be noted that SBV, which has been recorded in Europe (initially, Belgium/Germany/Netherlands) since November 2011, has not been reported, so far, to cause clinical signs in infected sheep during their viraemic stage. In susceptible adult bovines, transient febrile illness and milk drop were observed subsequent to their infection (see further details at https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/animalhealthwelfare/diseasecontrol/schmallenbergvirus/).

SBV does not transmit directly from animal to animal, other than maternal transmission from mother to offspring in utero. People who have been in close contact with infected animals (such as animal workers, farmers, and veterinarians) have not reported any unusual illnesses. The disease is not officially notifiable, but OIE has been publishing reports of infections as an "emerging" disease.

SBV has recently affected the territory of the Irish Republic. Earlier, recorded from Wales and Scotland.
