Late last year, ProMED-mail reported on a retrospective survey of clusters
of meningococcal disease in England & Wales. The report gave data on the
relative risk of further cases in various settings for subsequent time
periods. For example, the relative risk for household contacts in the week
after an index case arose was 1,200 & the relative risk for household
contacts between 7 and 30 days was 150. Some absolute risks were also
provided e.g.. 7-10/100,000 pupils in the same school in the month
following the index case.
Are relative risks and absolute risks convertible taking into account the
annual incidence of disease and the time period involved. That is, with an
annual incidence of 5 cases of meningococcal disease per 100,000 population
and a relative risk in household contacts of 1,200 in the 7 days following
an index case, is the absolute risk in a household contact in the 7 days
following the index case (5/100,000)(1/52)(1,200)(100)= 0.115% and is the
absolute risk in household contacts from 7 to 30 days from onset in the
index case (5/100,000)(3/52)(150)(100)= 0.009%?

Mathematically-speaking, you are correct...biologically-speaking, I'm not
quite sure.
It might be hazardous to extrapolate relative risk in a given household
cluster and time frame, to the entire population of the U.K. - for several
reasons:
1. We cannot assume that the 5/100,000 is evenly spread out in time and
space. It may well be that most of the '5 cases' were in one area at the
peak of 'meningococcal season.' National reporting data are influenced by
elements of regional carriage, prior experience with the organism, etc -
and may be widely skewed by, among other things, the very household cluster
which we use for comparison.
2. I am not sure that transmissibility (or relative risk rates) will
persist at a constant level over 30 days - in household or community. Risk
for each of the 4 weeks may not be a simple matter of risk/year divided by
52 (or risk over a month in household, divided by 4). For that matter, we
must take into consideration the element of incubation period following
case contact - that is time to appearance of meningitis, which is itself
determined by time to pharyngeal acquisition (and subsequent ?
meningococcal 'pharyngitis').
3. There may be an artifact in reporting - that is, household or any other
cluster of meningococcal disease is more likely to be reported than
individual cases (meaning that the 5/100,000 is not as valid as the risk
data for household contact). Thus, your equation mixes good data with bad.
