Acute Flaccid Paralysis Syndrome Associated with West Nile Virus
Infection --- Mississippi and Louisiana, July--August 2002
-------------------------
West Nile virus (WNV) infection can cause severe, potentially fatal
neurologic illnesses including encephalitis and meningitis (1,2).
Acute WNV infection also has been associated with acute flaccid
paralysis (AFP) attributed to a peripheral demyelinating process
(Guillain-Barre Syndrome [GBS]) (3), or to an anterior myelitis (4).
However, the exact etiology of AFP has not been assessed thoroughly
with electrophysiologic, laboratory, and neuroimaging data. This
report describes 6 cases of WNV-associated AFP in which clinical and
electrophysiologic findings suggest a pathologic process involving
anterior horn cells and motor axons similar to that seen in acute
poliomyelitis. Clinicians should evaluate patients with AFP for
evidence of WNV infection and conduct tests to differentiate GBS from
other causes of AFP.
Case Reports
Case 1. In July 2002, a previously healthy man aged 56 years from
Mississippi was admitted to a local hospital with a 3-day history of
fever, chills, vomiting, confusion, and acute painless weakness of
the arms and legs. On physical examination, he had tremor and
areflexic weakness in both arms and asymmetric weakness in the legs
with hypoactive reflexes; sensation was intact. Laboratory
abnormalities included a mildly elevated protein in the cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) (Table). An evolving stroke was diagnosed, and the
patient was treated with anticoagulant therapy; subsequently, the
illness was attributed to GBS, and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG)
therapy was initiated. A computerized tomography (CT) scan and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and cervical spine were
normal. Electromyography and nerve-conduction studies (EMG/NCS) were
indicative of a severe asymmetric process involving anterior horn
cells and/or their axons. An acute WNV infection was considered
probable on the basis of the presence of virus-specific IgM antibody
in serum.
Case 2. In July 2002, a man aged 57 years from Mississippi was
admitted to a local hospital with a 3-day history of fever, chills,
vomiting, and headache. Laboratory abnormalities indicated an
elevated protein and pleocytosis in the CSF. The patient subsequently
had acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. On physical
examination, rigidity in all extremities was observed with no
spontaneous movement. Following extubation, bilateral facial and
areflexic, asymmetric weakness was observed in all extremities;
sensory examination was normal. Brain MRI was normal. EMG/NCS were
indicative of a severe asymmetric process affecting anterior horn
cells and/or their axons. IgM and neutralizing antibody test results
confirmed an acute WNV infection.
Case 3. In July 2002, a man aged 56 years from Louisiana with a
history of hypertension and coronary artery disease was hospitalized
with a 4-day history of fever, vomiting, and painless asymmetric leg
weakness. On examination, the patient had a flaccid areflexic right
leg and a weak, hyporeflexic left leg; strength and reflexes in the
arms were normal. The patient had decreased sensation in a
stocking-and-glove distribution and a coarse upper extremity action
tremor. A lumbar puncture revealed a CSF pleocytosis (Table). He was
admitted with a diagnosis of postviral demyelination syndrome and
treated with antimicrobial medication, IVIG, and dexamethasone. MRI
of the spine revealed mild cervical spinal stenosis and homogeneous
enhancement of the cauda equina consistent with meningitis. EMG/NCS
were indicative of a severe asymmetric process affecting anterior
horn cells and/or their axons. IgM and neutralizing antibody test
results confirmed an acute WNV infection.
Case 4. In August 2002, a woman aged 69 years from Louisiana with a
history of diabetes and degenerative disc disease was hospitalized
with a 1-day history of vomiting, lethargy, confusion, fever, and
painless right arm weakness. On examination, the patient had nuchal
rigidity and a coarse tremor in the chin, left arm, and both legs.
The right arm was flaccid and areflexic; strength and reflexes in the
other extremities were normal. She was admitted with a diagnosis of
meningoencephalitis with associated focal motor radiculitis versus
monoplegia secondary to cerebrovascular ischemia. Head CT and brain
MRI showed chronic microvascular ischemic changes; MRI of the
cervical spine displayed mild narrowing of the spinal cord and the
right neural foramina at the C5-6 level. EMG/NCS indicated a severe,
asymmetric process affecting anterior horn cells and/or their axons.
IgM and neutralizing antibody test results confirmed an acute WNV
infection.
Case 5. In August 2002, a previously healthy man aged 50 years from
Mississippi was hospitalized with vomiting and headache. He had
flaccid, areflexic weakness in the right arm; sensation in all
extremities was normal. An acute stroke was diagnosed, and the
patient received anticoagulant therapy. EMG/NCS were indicative of a
severe, asymmetric process affecting anterior horn cells and/or their
axons in the right upper extremity. IgM and neutralizing antibody
test results confirmed an acute WNV infection.
Case 6. In August 2002, a man aged 46 years from Louisiana with a
history of coronary artery disease was admitted to a hospital with
fever, chills, fatigue, and leg weakness. He had a plegic and
areflexic right leg and mild left leg weakness; sensation was intact.
Laboratory abnormalities included a lymphocytic pleocytosis in CSF
(Table). The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of GBS and treated
with IVIG and antibiotics. An enhanced MRI of the spine revealed
findings suggestive of meningitis involving the conus medullaris and
cauda equina. EMG/NCS indicated a severe, asymmetric process
affecting anterior horn cells and/or their axons. IgM and
neutralizing antibody test results confirmed an acute WNV infection.
Editorial Note:
The clinical, laboratory, and electrophysiologic findings of these 6
patients suggest that WNV-associated AFP is a polio-like syndrome
with involvement of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and
motor axons. All 6 patients had acute onset of asymmetrical weakness
without pain or sensory loss. All but one of those with CSF drawn had
pleocytosis. Investigation of these patients is continuing.
A polio-like syndrome has been associated with flaviviruses other
than WNV (5), and anterior myelitis has occurred with WNV infection
(4). Investigations of primates (6) and other vertebrates infected
with WNV have documented involvement of spinal motor neurons and
lesions in the ventral gray matter of the spinal cord, with an
absence of lesions in peripheral nerves.
Previous case series have attributed WNV infection-associated AFP to
a peripheral neuronal process similar to GBS; acute poliomyelitis
might simulate GBS, causing diagnostic confusion (7). Clinical,
laboratory, and electrophysiologic features of these cases might help
differentiate poliomyelitis from GBS. In comparison with the
asymmetric AFP observed in these patients, GBS syndrome is more often
symmetric, generally involves sensory changes or paresthesias, and is
associated with an elevation of CSF protein in the absence of
pleocytosis. Additional features of typical GBS include an onset
several days following signs of acute infection and a generally
favorable outcome with rapid improvement in strength. In addition,
EMG/NCS typically suggest a predominantly demyelinating picture, or a
combined axonal and demyelinating process. A pure motor axonal
variant of GBS (8) might be confused with polio; however, this GBS
variant is typically characterized by symmetric, distally prominent
weakness and subclinical sensory nerve involvement on EMG/NCS.
Treatment modalities used for patients with GBS include
anticoagulation, IVIG, plasmapheresis, and high-dose corticosteroids.
These therapies have no beneficial effect for poliomyelitis and can
have significant morbidity (9,10). In areas where WNV transmission is
occurring, clinicians should suspect acute WNV infection and conduct
appropriate diagnostic tests in patients presenting with acute,
painless, asymmetric weakness, particularly in the setting of an
acute febrile illness with CSF pleocytosis. In addition, CSF
analysis, thorough EMG/NCS, and neuroimaging should be strongly
considered before initiating therapies for GBS or other peripheral
inflammatory processes.
Continued surveillance and public health investigation is needed to
fully define the scope of neurologic illnesses associated with WNV
infection. Health-care providers who are aware of patients with acute
WNV infection and AFP should contact their state or local health
departments and CDC, telephone 404-639-4657; e-mail, <zea3@cdc.gov>

[This is a very interesting report, identifying a polio-like syndrome
with involvement of anterior horn cells. Follow-up of these cases at
present is too short to note whether there is a similar pattern of
residual paralysis 60 days following onset of paralytic disease, or
whether the paralytic illness is transient with subsequent complete
recovery of function. This is important to mention, as one of the
criteria for classification of an acute flaccid paralysis case as a
probable case of polio is the presence of residual paralysis 60 days
after onset.
The Americas region (Western Hemisphere) has been free of wild
poliovirus circulation since the last case was identified in Peru in
1991. Surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP)
continues in the region to rapidly identify reintroduction of wild
poliovirus with potential for continued circulation of the virus in
the region. As WNV has been spreading throughout most of the
continental United States, and migratory birds from the USA do go
down to Mexico and Central America, it is not unreasonable to expect
that WNV will continue spreading throughout the Western Hemisphere.
The identification of WNV as an etiologic agent responsible for acute
flaccid paralysis raises the [future] question of whether WNV should
be added to the panel of AFP testing. Of note, the few reported
cases in this MMWR article are all in adults, whereas current efforts
for AFP surveillance as part of the polio eradication program efforts
are currently directed at the population under 15 years of age.
Readers are reminded that these reports represent a very small number
of cases (6) compared with the number of cases of WNV infection
confirmed in the USA (1641 laboratory-confirmed cases as of 18 Sep
2002), suggesting it is a low-level occurrence (3.7 per 1000
laboratory-confirmed cases). However, it does warrant continued
surveillance and investigation.
