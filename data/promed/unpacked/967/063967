A 59-year-old woman from McKinley County is in critical condition at
University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque with the state's 5th
confirmed case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS], the New Mexico
Department of Health announced today [3 Aug 2011].

"While cases of hantavirus [infection] are uncommon, the 5 cases we
have had this year [2011] serve as a reminder of the importance in
following our prevention guidelines to keep all New Mexicans safe and
reduce their risk of being exposed to infected mice," Health Secretary
Dr. Catherine Torres said in a news release.

So far this year [2011], there have been 3 fatal cases of HPS: a
51-year-old McKinley County woman whose case was reported in January
2011; a 35-year-old Torrance County man reported in May 2011; and a
23-year-old man from McKinley County reported last month [July 2011],
the health department said. A 39-year-old McKinley County man whose
case was reported in May [2011] has recovered from the illness,
officials said.

People can become infected and develop disease from HPS when they
breathe in aerosolized virus particles that have been transmitted by
infected rodents through urine, droppings or saliva, according to the
release. The main carrier of the disease in New Mexico is the deer
mouse [_Peromyscus maniculatus_].

[This is the 2nd case of HPS in McKinley County, Washington state
within a 2-week period. The hantavirus involved in this and the
previous cases are not specified but most likely is Sin Nombre virus,
maintained in _Peromyscus maniculatus_ populations.

After having sent clinical samples to the Institute of Public Health
[ISP] to corroborate the cause of death of a 71-year-old woman who was
a presumptive hantavirus infection case, this Monday [1 Aug 2011], the
Health SEREMI Claudio Vallejos confirmed the suspicions.

According to the health authority's report, in addition to the woman
who died due to the virus [infection], currently, there are 10
discarded cases and 2 men suspected of having contracted the virus
[infection].

According to Claudio Vallejos, the 1st [suspected case] is a
35-year-old from the Picaflor area north of Manihuales and the other a
42-year-old from Sector 6 Lagunas. Both are admitted to the Coyhaique
Regional Hospital and are in isolation and in stable condition.
Samples have been sent to the ISP.

SEREMI Claudio Vallejos expressed his satisfaction with the reception
in the community toward preventive measures and reminded residents
that they must maintain these measures as long as the overpopulation
of rodents in the Aysen region continues.
