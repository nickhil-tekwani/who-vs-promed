Measles -- DR Congo (Katanga)
-------------------------
Suspected measles cases were reported for about one week in Kampunda IDP [internally displaced persons] camp, located 40 km [about 25 miles] north-west of Kalemie-Bendera, the axis [in Katanga Province, Democratic Republic of Congo]. The balance sheet reported 3 deaths and dozens of affected households. The health division of UNICEF and Kalemie health zone quickly dispatched a medical team to the site. The team deployed identified 8 new cases with clinical signs of measles.

Upon arrival, the team took care of the sick, and then took samples of 5 patients. These samples will be analyzed at the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in Kinshasa. To this end, all children under 15 living in the site are to be targeted by a fightback campaign, and a medical team has been advised at this location. The disease has already killed 3 people, including 2 children and one adult of 18 years. This disease scares people living in the camp. Many of its occupants have begun to empty the site and move to the bush, fearing contamination. 40 households were affected in the space of a week.

[The Katanga region regularly records cases of measles. The disease is about to become endemic. Measles is a viral disease, contagious and responsible for epidemics, especially in disadvantaged areas. Yet it is one of the few infectious diseases that have an effective vaccine that is available and well tolerated, but still remains a major public health problem in our communities. Broad awareness of mothers during prenatal consultations could improve vaccination coverage against measles and drastically reduce mortality and morbidity associated with the disease.

Ministry changes response to Sudan's measles outbreak
----------------------------------------------------
The Sudanese Ministry of Health reported that a change in the response to the measles epidemic is needed, stressing that vaccination campaigns should not only cover affected localities. The total number of deaths in 2015 has risen to 38. The Ministry of Health confirmed 2511 cases in Sudan as of 24 May [2015], a rise of 12 percent since 3 May [2015]. 4545 patients are suspected to suffer from measles, compared to 427 cases at the start of May [2015]. 38 of these suspected cases died. The under-15-years age group has the highest percentage of reported cases. In the latest news bulletin by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Ministry also reports that the only state not affected is River Nile.

A change in the approach to responding to disease outbreaks is required, the Ministry of Health, World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) said. They recommended that vaccination campaigns should cover states in full and not only affected localities, and should ideally cover the whole country.

Second vaccination campaign
---------------------------
WHO and UNICEF will support the Health Ministry to conduct a 2nd response vaccination campaign, targeting about 1.85 million children between 6 months and 15 years of age, in 22 localities in North, South, East and Central Darfur states. Planning for this campaign is underway, OCHA writes.

However, a lack of funding has hampered widening the scale of the campaign. The funding gap in achieving coverage in all 5 Darfur states is [USD] 1.8 million. The 1st vaccination campaign with the same target group targeted 1.69 million children, and managed to reach 1.71 million. In May [2015], the director of the Immunisation Department in East Darfur, Abdelrazeg El Dom, attributed the rise in measles mortality rates to poor government funding and the lack of vaccines.

Details of 5 cases
------------------
On 10 Jun 2015, the National IHR Focal Point of Chile notified WHO of 5 cases of measles infection.

Details of the cases are as follows:

- A 31-year-old male from Santiago developed symptoms on 12 May [2015] and tested positive for measles on 15 May [2015]. He traveled to China from 4 to 28 April [2015]. According to the epidemiological investigation, the incubation period coincides with the date of travel to China-Hawaii-Santiago; the patient reported contact with symptomatic passengers during the 1st segment of travel (Beijing-Honolulu) back to Santiago.

- An infant under 10 months of age from Maria Pinto municipality, Santiago, developed symptoms on 25 May [2015] and tested positive for measles on 29 May [2015]. The infant did not receive the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine because, according to the national immunization schedule, the child was not yet due for vaccination. To date, a direct epidemiological link with the 1st case has not been established. However, the infant's viral genotype was confirmed as H1; this virological evidence may relate cases 1 and 2 as part of the same chain of transmission.

- A 38-year-old male from Santiago developed symptoms on 1 Jun [2015], within the incubation period of case 1. As with case 2, H1 viral genotype was determined.

- A 44-year-old male health care worker from the municipality of Las Condes in Santiago developed symptoms on 3 Jun [2015] and tested positive for measles on 6 Jun [2015]. The patient was admitted to hospital, and currently is recovering at home.

- A 21-year-old male, relative of the 2nd case, developed symptoms on 4 Jun [2015] and tested positive for measles on 10 May [2015].

Public health response
----------------------
Public health measures have focused on alerting public and private networks alongside intensifying surveillance to ensure timely investigation of cases. All identified suspected case contacts are being immediately vaccinated (without waiting for laboratory confirmation) while vaccination of children is being strengthened. The objective is to interrupt the chain of transmission.

In relation to "Copa America Chile 2015", which is being hosted in Chile from 11 Jun to 4 Jul [2015], the health authorities of Chile and the Pan American Health Organization have recommended travelers to the country to make sure that they are up-to-date with vaccinations for measles or to be vaccinated 2 weeks before departure.

New suspected case of measles, now in Antofagasta
-------------------------------------------------
So far, 5 cases have been confirmed. A new suspected case of measles has now been recorded in the country [Chile], according to the announcement of the Health Directorate of the Municipal Social Development Corporation of Antofagasta [region]. As a consequence there have been requests for vaccination.

According to the statement in the medical center, the youth had the following symptoms: rash (spots and rash), cough, fever and malaise. Because of the above specific symptoms, all protocols specified for a case of measles were applied, such as preventive respiratory patient treatment and referral to the Regional Hospital for sampling.

For now, the case remains pending confirmation or discarding of pathology, according to the analysis of the sample by the Institute of Public Health. Note that so far there are only 5 cases of confirmed measles across the country.
