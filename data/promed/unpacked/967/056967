There has been severe rainfall in the area around Cairns [Queensland, Australia] with more than 400 mm [15.7 inches] falling in less than 24 hours in parts of the Tropical Coast and Hinterland on [Thu 8 Mar 2018].

A woman spotted a huge crocodile just metres from the road as she made her way home from work in Ingham on Thursday night [8 Mar 2018].

One person has died from the soil-borne disease melioidosis in the region since the start of the year [2018], the Cairns and Hinterland Hospital and Health Service said. 'While it might seem tempting to play in puddles, heavy rains across Far North Queensland are increasing the risk of exposure to soil-borne diseases so it's important to stay out of muddy, flooded areas,' the department said on [Fri 9 Mar 2018]. There had been 6 confirmed cases in 2018 of the disease [melioidosis] while there was also a further 9 of leptospirosis. Both diseases have no vaccine and are caused by bacteria found in soil and muddy surface waters. People can get infected when 'skin abrasions or wounds come into contact with contaminated wet soil or water', the health service warned.

Melioidosis can lead to coughs and difficulty breathing 'and almost always result in hospitalisation.' Skin infections or abscesses can also be a sign. Leptospirosis symptoms include fever, headaches, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, and bloodshot eyes.

Most areas had seen between 100-200 mm [3.94-7.88 inches] fall overnight on [Thu 8 Mar 2018], the Bureau of Meteorology said. The place with the highest rainfall on Thursday night was Kirrama Range, which had 409 mm [16.1 inches]. It is the extensive floodwater, which has led to the health warning issued by the state government and a disaster warning declared for Hinchinbrook [Island].

The declaration has granted extra powers to the emergency services in order to help keep people safe, Queensland fire and emergencies minister Craig Crawford said. He added: 'In a situation like this it is essential that our 1st responders can take actions to minimise and prevent loss of life, illness and injury, and property, and environmental damage.'

Boil water alerts have been introduced for Cassowary Coast and also around Millaa Millaa on the Atherton Tablelands as residents were urged to check with their local council to see if they were affected. Public health officials have also warned people to wear protective footwear outdoors, gloves in the garden and on farms, cover abrasions and sores with waterproof dressings, washing thoroughly after exposure to soil and muddy water. Diabetics have also been warned to maintain 'optimal foot care' as residents were told to clean up the workplace and home to 'minimise contact with animal urine.'

Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk led a news conference on Friday afternoon [9 Mar 2018] with representatives from police, fire service, and the BoM [Bureau of Meteorology].

On [Fri 9 Mar 2018], 4 flood warnings remain in place for Far North Queensland weather forecasters have said. This includes for the Herbert, Tully, Murray, Mulgrave, Russell, and Johnston rivers. Flood levels on the rivers are expected to 'remain high for the next few days', Victoria Dodds, Queensland flood manager for the BoM said.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide and is transmitted to humans by exposure to soil, fresh water, or food contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic leptospira. _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals, for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Also leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities, such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking, that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from leptospire-infected animals, as well as household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents (https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/exposure/index.html).

_Burkholderia pseudomallei_, the cause of melioidosis, can be found in soil and surface water in South East Asia and in northern, tropical Australia (Queensland and Northern Territory). Melioidosis usually occurs during the rainy season and may be accentuated by extreme flooding from rain. For a discussion of melioidosis, please see my colleague, ProMED-mail moderator LL's comment in the recent post Melioidosis - Australia (02): (NT) 20180210.5620284.

Cairns, with a population of 147 993 residents, is a major city on the east coast of Far North Queensland in Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairns). A map of Australia showing the location of Cairns can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/v579hLxmQK42. The Cassowary Coast region is a local government area in the Far North Queensland region of Queensland, Australia, south of Cairns (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassowary_Coast_Region).
