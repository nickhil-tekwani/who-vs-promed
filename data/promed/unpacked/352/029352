A bacterial infection found in the intestines of many animals and common in pigs, _Yersinia enterocolitica_, has been found in 18 Danes since 30 Mar 2019. So far, 10 women and 8 men aged 2-74 from all over Denmark have been diagnosed with the rare infection, reported BT.

"Right now, we have an outbreak of the bacterium _Yersinia enterocolitica_. It is a disease like salmonella that typically infects people via food," said Luise Muller from the State Serum Institute (SSI).

The disease is not common in Denmark. Over the last 5 years, there have only been 3 outbreaks. SSI is trying to localise the source of the infection by looking for common threads in the infected people's diet.

Typical symptoms are generally feeling under the weather, violent stomach pains, fever, and diarrhea. The incubation period is usually 3-7 days. "The best advice we can give people is to cook meat thoroughly and wash fruit and vegetables carefully," said Muller.

Sweden has seen a similar outbreak, and the Danish and Swedish authorities are working together to map the infection.

In the 1980s, the infection used to be just as common as salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis, but it has become rarer nowadays. In 2014 there were 414 registered cases.

[The 2 species of _Yersinia_ associated with food-borne disease are _pseudotuberculosis_ and _enterocolitica_. The latter species can be associated with abdominal pain as a hallmark symptom. As a mesenteric lymphadenitis, yersiniosis can mimic appendicitis but may also cause infections of other sites, such as wounds, joints, and the urinary tract.

As noted in the FDA "Bad Bug Book" (https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170406190140/https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/CausesOfIllnessBadBugBook/ucm070040.htm), "Strains of _Y. enterocolitica_ can be found in meats (pork, beef, lamb, etc.), oysters, fish, and raw milk. The exact cause of the food contamination is unknown. However, the prevalence of this organism in soil, water, and animals, such as beavers, pigs, and squirrels, offers ample opportunities for it to enter our food supply. Poor sanitation and improper sterilization techniques by food handlers, including improper storage, cannot be overlooked as contributing to contamination."

Additionally, some strains of these organisms can be associated with blood transfusion-associated illnesses due to an ability to grow at refrigerator temperatures. - Mod.LL
