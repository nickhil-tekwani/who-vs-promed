Bluetongue in Argentina: serotyping of the virus isolated from cattle in
northern Argentina
------------------------
Translation of information received on 1 Jul 2002 from Dr Bernardo Gabriel
Cane, President, National Agrifood Health and Quality Service (SENASA),
Secretariat for Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Food, Buenos Aires:
End of previous report period: 11 Oct 2001 [OIE Disease Information of 12
October 2001, <http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_24.HTM#Sec9>]. End of
this report period: 28 May 2002.
This information relates to studies for identifying the bluetongue virus
carried out at the Institute for Animal Health (IAH), Pirbright, United
Kingdom (OIE Reference Laboratory for bluetongue), based on specimens
isolated from cattle in northern Argentina during a monitoring programme to
study the incidence and seasonality of the infection, conducted during
active bluetongue surveillance in the country.
According to information transmitted by the INTA (National Institute of
Agricultural Technology) via the SENASA (Servicio Nacional de Sanidad y
Calidad Agroalimentaria) central laboratory, "The four bluetongue virus
strains isolated in the country and sent to IAH for serotyping were
analysed by means of the micro-seroneutralisation technique, making use of
13 reference serotypes identified as predominant in Central and Southern
America, and the RT-PCR [reverse transcriptase -- polymerase chain
reaction] technique with primers from segment 2 of the bluetongue virus
genome specific to serotype 4. The results indicate that the four samples
are of serotype 4 of the bluetongue virus".

[Bluetongue (BT) is an infectious, noncontagious disease of sheep and
domestic and wild ruminants, such as goats, cattle, deer, bighorn sheep,
most species of African antelope, and various other artiodactyla. It does
not affect humans. BT is caused by a virus classified within the Orbivirus
genus of the family Reoviridae. At present 24 distinct serotypes have been
identified as a result of serum neutralisation tests.
The outcome of infection ranges from inapparent in the vast majority of
infected animals to fatal in a proportion of infected sheep, deer, and some
wild ruminants. In sheep of susceptible breeds, and with highly pathogenic
strains of BT virus, mortality rates of 50 per cent or over have been
recorded. Although BT virus infection is generally commoner in cattle than
in sheep, overt disease in cattle is rare and the signs, when they occur,
are much milder than those observed in sheep. Certain strains of BT virus
are said to be capable of causing fetal death, resorption, and/or abortions
in cattle, but there is little evidence that this happens in areas where
strains of BT virus are endemic. Most cases in goats are subclinical or
mild, resembling the disease picture in cattle.
Argentina's report on its first isolation of BTV and the
serotyping-identification carried out at Pirbright are of great
significance. The presence of BT virus serotype 4 in the continent had been
initially demonstrated when the virus was isolated from cattle imported
from Brazil to a quarantine in Florida in 1980 (Groocock CM, Campbell CH.
Can J Comp Med 1982; 46(2): 160-4). It was found to be the predominant BT
virus serotype in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic between 1987 and
1992 (Mo CL, et al. Am J Vet Res 1994; 55(2): 211-5).
BT virus 4 is a widespread (and the oldest known) serotype in Africa and
the Middle East, but is regarded as exotic to North America; 5 serotypes of
BT virus have been isolated thus far in the United States, but only BT
virus serotypes 10, 11, 13, and 17 are currently active. BT virus serotype
2, originally isolated from animals imported into Florida, may not have
established itself in the US (see "Foreign animal diseases - the gray
book", the United States Animal Health Association (USAHA), 1998
<http://www.vet.uga.edu/vpp/gray_book/FAD/Search/search.htm>.
Out of the 13 South American mainland countries, 6 countries have already
reported to the OIE about the presence of bluetongue within their
territories. In 4 of them (Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela) the
disease presence was based solely on serological evidence. The only
evidence on clinical expression of BT disease in South America has come
from Brazil, where an outbreak in Parana, during Apr 2001, has been
reported to the OIE, mentioning 3 deaths in sheep, 1 in a goat, and 130
destroyed. This was followed by 6 outbreaks reported in Feb, Mar, and Apr
2002: 31 deaths in goats and 9 in sheep. As mentioned above, clinical
disease in goats is unusual. The initial diagnosis of the outbreak in April
2001 was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the Pan American
Foot and Mouth Disease Center (Rio de Janeiro), and material was reportedly
sent for further diagnosis to the Laboratory of the National Centre for
Exotic Animal Disease, Winnipeg, Canada. No information on the outcome of
the further diagnostic investigations nor on the BT virus serotype involved
could be found in the OIE publications. Details would be appreciated.
The isolation of BT virus from healthy cattle in Argentina may indicate
spread of BTV in South America. It is desirable that clinical, serological,
virological, and entomological active surveillance will be initiated or
enhanced in other parts of the subcontinent in the footsteps of the
commendable Argentinian monitoring programme. - Mod.AS]
