[The death toll from JE virus infections in Gaya has gone from 16 on
11 Sep 2011 (see ProMed-mail archive no. 20110912.2774) to 25 just 2
days later. All are attributed to JE virus, with no mention of the
acute encephalitis syndrome of undetermined etiology previously
mentioned in recent reports from northeastern India. There is still no
mention of the JE vaccination status of this population.

Gaya is the 2nd largest city in Bihar state and the capital of the
district. A HealthMap Interactive map showing the location of Gaya can
