Feared fish disease found in Aland Islands
------------------------------------------
Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia (VHS), a viral disease affecting fish, has
been found in the Aland Islands, Finland.
The disease was reportedly found at a fish farm where it was also found
last year, when the virus was spotted in Finland for the first time. It is
thought it has been spread by wild fish.
The infected fish are to be killed and the farm will be closed off.
