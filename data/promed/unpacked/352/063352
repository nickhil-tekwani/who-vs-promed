Animal health international trade unit. Customer information note
on trade in live animals and hatching eggs: number 99/37
29 October 1999
To: AATA and Interested Parties
New measures adopted by the European Commission:
Dioxin contamination in Belgium - imports of pigs, live poultry and
their hatching eggs
1. The Commission has recently re-assessed the dioxin
contamination problems in Belgium and has now adopted a new
Decision (99/640/EC) which repeals previous Decisions. This
Decision extends the restrictions to all live poultry (as opposed to
just domestic fowl) reared since 15 January 1999 and their
hatching eggs laid since that date.
2. The effect of this is Belgium is now prohibited from placing on
the market, trading or exporting to third countries: pigs, live poultry
and their hatching eggs reared/laid after 15 January 1999; unless
they are accompanied by a supplementary declaration issued by
the Belgian authorities, as set out in the Commission Decision.
This requirement is legally implemented in England and Wales by a
Declaration issued under Regulation 27 of the Animals and Animal
Products (Import and Export) Regulations 1998, a copy of which is
enclosed. A similar Declaration has been issued in Scotland.
3. Cattle are not required to be accompanied by a declaration from
the Belgian competent authority since they are not included in the
new Decision.
4. If you wish to import pigs, live poultry or their hatching eggs from
Belgium you are advised to make enquiries of your proposed
supplier to ensure that they will be accompanied by Enclosure I or II
as set out in the attached Declaration [not included here.TCH, in
addition to the veterinary health certificate accompanying the
consignment.
5. Anyone who has imported pigs, live poultry or their hatching
eggs from Belgium since15 Jan 1999 - and who has not yet been
contacted by the Ministry should notify their local Divisional
Veterinary Manager immediately.
6. Persons wishing to re-export pigs, live poultry or their hatching
eggs originally imported from Belgium should confirm the
requirement for an additional declaration with the importing country.
If a declaration is required the relevant section at Tolworth or
Pentland House, as appropriate, should be contacted.
