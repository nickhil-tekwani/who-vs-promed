Summit County Public Health investigators are looking into a cluster of 6 confirmed mumps virus cases. The cases are all associated with people at Arapahoe Basin Ski Area.

Investigators are broadening their surveillance area for the possibility of more mumps cases. The confirmed cases are all employees or people associated with those employees. There are no known skiers or boarders confirmed in the mumps cases.

A massive education campaign led by the county health department aims to increase awareness and prevention of mumps, a contagious disease caused by a virus that is currently present in the Rio Grande Valley.

Last week, a case of mumps was found at Bryan Elementary School, which is part of the Mission Consolidated Independent School District. When the discovery was made at the campus, students were sent home with a letter detailing how the district was handling the sanitation of the school, and phone calls were made that same evening.

In the letter, information on how the virus is spread, symptoms of the mumps and vaccination details were all highlighted. It also encouraged families to keep sick children out of school.

According to Hidalgo County Health and Human Services Director Eduardo Olivarez, keeping the public informed in this way is one of the ways to keep the virus contained.

"Of all the cases [in the county], over half of them are between 20 and 30 years old, which is odd," Olivarez said. "We're talking with the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and the Department of State Health Services, and we can't figure it out. It's not a new strain or a wild strain; it's genotype G, for general mumps. Across the country, it's all the same age group, so we don't think it was a bad lot of vaccines because it's so spread out."

As of Monday [20 May 2019] morning, 46 confirmed cases of the mumps have been diagnosed in Hidalgo County since the end of March/beginning of April 2019.

"Confirmation is done by a combination of laboratory testing and physical symptoms identified by a physician," Olivarez said. "We have reported cases in pretty much every major community in Hidalgo County, so this is no longer in just a concentrated area."

There are cases in Mission, McAllen, Pharr, Weslaco, San Juan and Edinburg.

"The good thing is of those 46 cases, probably less than 8 as of printing may still be contagious, but all the other cases are no longer contagious," Olivarez said. "But they're isolated; they are staying home from work or school."

Olivarez said that currently, there are 10 pending cases that the county is still waiting to hear results from. He brought up the R0 (pronounced "R naught") measurement, which is the number of people one sick person will infect.

The R0 for mumps states that for every person who contracts the virus, 10 more will be infected. The value for hepatitis C and Ebola is 2, for HIV and SARS, 4, and measles is 18.

"I'm expecting a 3rd wave, which is probably going to be right about now," Olivarez said. "Towards the end of this month [May 2019], I'm expecting more cases to come up just because of exposure. I'm expecting another one at the end of June 2019."

Olivarez said the high vaccination rate in the county has prevented the virus from spreading faster and kept it more contained. 46 cases out of over an estimated one million people is less than .01 percent.

"We have an average vaccination rate [ages 6 to 19 in Hidalgo County] of 85 to 90 percent vaccinated," Olivarez said. "That's a high number, and it's been like that for several years."

The department also stressed that the current spread of the virus has not come from any immigration issues in Hidalgo County. They have been in weekly contact with Customs and Border Patrol, who have seen one outbreak in a Cameron County detention facility but none in Hidalgo.

"I average 2-3 mumps cases every year, usually found in children," Olivarez said. "This is the 1st time we have had a public outbreak in many years, probably over 15, 20 years."

The mumps outbreak will be considered finished after the county goes 42 days without a case.

[The report notes that over half of the cases are between 20 and 30 years old. It has been noted that mumps resurgence in young adults is likely due to waning vaccine-derived immunity. See https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180321141401.htm; Date: 21 Mar 2018; Source: Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health:

Summary:
A resurgence of mumps in the US among vaccinated young adults appears to be due to waning of vaccine-induced immunity, according to a recent analysis. Researchers found vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps lasts about 27 years after the last dose. The findings suggest that, in addition to the currently recommended 2 doses of mumps vaccine in childhood, a 3rd dose at age 18 may help sustain protection.

Abstract.
"Following decades of declining mumps incidence amid widespread vaccination, the United States and other developed countries have experienced a resurgence in mumps cases over the last decade. Outbreaks affecting vaccinated individuals and communities with high vaccine coverage have prompted concerns about the effectiveness of the live attenuated vaccine currently in use. It is unclear if immune protection wanes, or if the vaccine protects inadequately against currently circulating mumps virus lineages. Synthesizing data from 6 studies of mumps vaccine effectiveness, we estimated that vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps wanes on average 27 (95% confidence interval: 16 to 51) years post-vaccination. After accounting for this waning, we found no evidence that the emergence of heterologous virus genotypes contributed to changes in vaccine effectiveness over time. A mathematical model of mumps transmission confirmed the central role of waning immunity to the vaccine in the re-emergence of mumps cases. Outbreaks from 2006 to the present among young adults, and outbreaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s among adolescents, aligned with peaks in mumps susceptibility of these age groups predicted to be due to loss of vaccine-derived protection. In contrast, evolution of mumps virus strains escaping immune pressure would be expected to cause a higher proportion of cases among children, not adolescents and young adults as observed. Routine use of a 3rd vaccine dose at age 18 years, or booster dosing throughout adulthood, may be a strategy to prevent mumps re-emergence and should be assessed in clinical trials." - Mod.LK]

http://www.rojakdaily.com/news/article/6813/mumps-cases-on-the-rise-in-terengganu-182-recorded-in-just-one-week


The spread of mumps in Terengganu has recorded an alarming increase to 182 cases as of Sun [12 May 2019], compared to only 114 cases earlier this month [May 2019], Astro Awani reported.

Terengganu health director Dr Mohd Jusoh told the news portal that the increase of 68 cases within a span of 2 weeks involved a full boarding school in Kuala Terengganu. He also said that to date, 85 students from the school were infected with mumps, some of whom have recovered. An entire boarding school was infected.

These students, according to Dr Mohd Jusoh, are quarantined at their homes, as their schools do not have proper quarantine facilities. He added that quarantined students must be closely monitored by parents or guardians, so that they do not go out to public places such as Ramadan bazaars or shopping malls.

Meanwhile, Terengganu Education Department director Shafruddin Ali Hussein told Bernama that his department has been working closely with the state Health Department to stop the spread of the disease.

Known as "beguk" in Malay, mumps is a viral infection that primarily affects salivary glands. According to Mayo clinic, people infected with mumps either show no symptoms or very mild ones. However, when symptoms develop, they usually appear about 2-3 weeks after exposure to the virus.
