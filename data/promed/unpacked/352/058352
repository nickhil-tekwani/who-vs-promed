[The European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth disease (FMD) monthly report "Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation" (see March 2019 report at https://www.eufmd.info/gmr/0d12ef11-1317-44c7-9431-431ff8d1f1cc) notes the following:

"An FMD outbreak due to FMDV serotype O was reported on a backyard farm of cattle, sheep, and goats [on 8 Mar 2019] at [Zabaikalskiy Krai], where all species were clinically affected. Apparent morbidity rates were respectively 15.94% in cattle (33 animals out of 207) and 0.55% in the small ruminants (6 animals out of 1100) The Regional Reference Laboratory for FMD (Arriah, Russia) confirmed the diagnosis [on 11 Mar 2019] using real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR). The source of the outbreaks is unknown, and general control measures were adopted including elimination of animals and vaccination of 4522 cattle and 4433 small ruminants. Details on the type of vaccine employed were not provided.

"FMDV serotype O detected in the outbreaks that occurred at Zabaikalskiy Krai as O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage that was submitted to VMSD tests with good matching results with vaccine strains O/SEA/Mya-98, O/PanAsia, and O/PanAsia 2.

"In East Asia, new FMD cases have been detected in the Republic of (South) Korea and Zabaikalskiy in the eastern part of Russia due to the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001e lineage. The rapid spread of this lineage across many countries in the region has been widely discussed in previous reports, and sequences from both of these cases are most closely related to viruses detected in China (2018). The complexity of FMD epidemiology in East Asia is further demonstrated by the detection of additional new cases in eastern Russia, which are due to the O/SEA/Mya-98 (in Primorskiy) and O/MESA/PanAsia (in Zabaikalskiy) lineages and share a closer relationship to viruses from Viet Nam and Mongolia, respectively."

A summary of the genotyping results of the FMDV-positive samples collected in Russia between February 2018 and March 2019 [3554 serum samples collected from non-vaccinated animals], a map location of FMDV genotyped samples collected in Russia in this period of time, and the vaccination activities carried out in the Russian Federation for the reporting month are available in the same report (pages 8 and 9). - Mod.CRD
