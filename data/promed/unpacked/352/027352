Comment on Brucellosis, bovine - Spain: (GA) RFI 20121118.1414609
-----------------------------------------------------------
Rates of human brucellosis in Spain and surrounding countries [France, Portugal Andora] have been decreasing for several years -- see graph http://cdn.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Brucella-Spain.png.

As recently as 1990, reports had suggested that brucellosis was as common as salmonellosis -- see graph http://cdn.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Brucella-Spain2.png. [1-3]
