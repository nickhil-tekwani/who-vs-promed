Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1):
Outbreak location: Runnymede, Surrey, England
Started: 19 Oct 2021
Ended: 15 Dec 2021
Epidemiological unit: zoo
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Tiger (_Panthera tigris_): Felidae-Carnivora / 3 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population: Three tigers, kept in the same enclosure in a zoo, presented clinical signs (coughing, diarrhoea, inappetence). Sputum sample from one tiger was sampled privately and returned a positive result for SARS-CoV-2. Official samples (oral and nasal swabs and faeces) were then tested at the NRL, Weybridge. Two further tigers were confirmed positive. The first tiger's retest was negative. A leopard in a neighbouring enclosure tested negative. The tigers have recovered. Recent contact with a COVID-19 positive zoo handler could not be confirmed.

Epidemiology

[Infection by SARS-CoV-2 in big cats kept at zoos continues to occur. Lions and tigers have been the ones most frequently reported infected, which may be due to their susceptibility but also because they are common at zoos. - Mod.PMB
