The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration finds COVID-19 in a 3rd North Jutland mink herd

A mink herd in Hjorring municipality [North Jutland; map at https://tinyurl.com/y8mw7h82] with approx. 5000 mink is infected with COVID-19. The government has decided that the herd should be killed for reasons of precaution. The Food Board on Monday [29 Jun 2020] sampled the herd. This was because people related to the mink farm told the Food Authority that they were found infected with COVID-19. The test results show that more than 50% of the herd is infected with COVID-19.

The mink farm is located in an area where the local population has been affected by a virus strain that has led to the killing of 2 mink herds. It is not yet clear whether the 3rd infected farm is infected with the same virus strain.

It is against this background that the government has decided that this 3rd infected herd must also be killed on the basis of a precautionary principle. The National Board of Food expects the herd to be killed on Friday [3 Jul 2020].

None of the 3 infected herds are among the approx. 120 mink farms included in a national screening for COVID-19.

[Since 17 Jun 2020, the Danish competent authority in animal health reported the infection of 2 other mink farms in the same area. Also, in the 1st infected farm, a family dog was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. It is the 1st finding in pets in Denmark. More information about this event can be found in ProMED post archive no. 20200624.7506728.

Denmark is the 2nd country, after the Netherlands, to report infection with SARS-CoV-2 in farmed mink. - Mod.SF

[2] Netherlands: 18th mink farm infected by COVID-19

Dutch authorities announced Friday [3 Jul 2020] that yet another mink farm has been infected with the novel coronavirus, making 18 in total, with thousands of animals to be culled.

The outbreak was reported on a farm at Landhorst [North Brabant] in the southeast, the Health Ministry said in a statement, in the same region where 17 other farms were also infected.

"The infection was discovered because the mink showed symptoms of the disease, and farmers are obliged to report it," the ministry said.

The farm, which has more than 4300 animals "will be cleared as soon as possible," it added.

The Netherlands first reported in April [2020] that 2 mink farms had been infected with the COVID-19 disease.

At least 2 workers were also infected in what the World Health Organization said could be the 1st known animal-to-human transmissions.

Last month [June 2020] authorities culled thousands of mink on farms infected by the coronavirus.

The farming of mink for fur is a controversial subject in the Netherlands, where all mink farms will have to be phased out by 2024.

Last week [week of 22 Jun 2020] Dutch MPs voted overwhelmingly in favor of shutting mink farms by the end of the year [2020], with the government saying it was working on plans to help farmers close down the farms.

The Netherlands has reported more than 50 000 coronavirus infections [in humans], with more than 6100 deaths, according to official figures.

[3] Denmark: precautionary measures on mink farms

Precautions on contacting mink where infection or confirmed infection with COVID-19 is suspected
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The National Board of Health recommends the following infection prevention measures if you have contact with mink in a suspected or infected herd:

1. Personnel with symptoms of COVID-19 should be tested and not come into the stable.
2. Restrict the circle of persons in the stable and avoid visitors.
3. Pets are not allowed in the barn.
4. Avoid contact with house cats.
5. Hand hygiene:
- The hands are washed frequently and at least before entering the stable; after contact with animals, cages, and feed; if the hands are dirty; before eating; and after coughing / sneezing;
- When you leave the barn area, both handwashing and hand disinfection are performed;
- Handwashing is used if the hands are visibly dirty or damp and after a toilet visit;
- Hand disinfection can be used if the hands are visibly clean and dry (alcohol 70-85% added glycerol) [additional comments re handwashing included].
6. Cough or sneeze in the sleeve.
7. With water and soap, frequently clean surfaces contacted by others, such as taps, work tools.
8. Avoid bringing items into the stable, such as watches, finger rings, mobile phones, tools, etc.
9. Avoid eating/drinking/smoking and the like in the barn area.
10. Put on protective gear prior to entering the animal housing area [details included].
11. Ensure respiratory protection, minimum FFP2. The mask should be close to the face.
12. Use goggles or face visors.
13. Take a bath after work and before contact with household members.

If your mink herd is suspected or found to be infected with COVID-19, the herd will be placed under public supervision by the National Food Authority. This means, among other things, that you are not allowed to move animals or equipment that can spread infection from your herd. You will receive public oversight in writing from the National Board of Food, which describes these restrictions in more detail.

[In 2015, days after a court decision in the Netherlands spelled the end for the Dutch mink farming industry, Denmark's environment and food minister unequivocally expressed support for the Danish mink farmers, saying, "The production of mink pelts is important for the Danish economy and employs thousands of people," concluding, "Denmark has a long tradition of producing pelt of the very highest quality, and there is a great demand for them. The government has no plans to follow the Netherlands' example."

The Danish mink industry is regarded the world's largest (its main customers are China/Hong Kong). The other top mink producers, besides Netherlands, are China, Poland, and the USA. So far, no information about COVID-19 in minks nor of surveillance activities has become available from these 3 countries.

However, a circular titled "Interim SARS-CoV-2 Guidance and Recommendations for Farmed Mink and Other Mustelids" has been recently distributed to mink producers in Wisconsin, where USA's leading mink industry is located. The document, developed collaboratively by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and state animal and public health partners using a One Health approach, is available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/one_health/downloads/sars-cov-2-guidance-for-farmed-mink.pdf. It deserves to be reminded that COVID-19 in minks is not readily identifiable due to its mild clinical signs and relatively short course, as apparent from the Dutch and Danish observations. Hence, to obtain early information on this zoonotic disease in the USA, a more proactive approach will be required (e.g., planned official surveillance and obligatory notification of suspected cases by producers and veterinary practitioners). Similar measures are expected from other mink countries, such as China and Poland.

The initial findings of investigations and research of the Dutch COVID-19 event in minks, which started 23 Apr 2020, has been subject to a scientific paper published in Eurosurveillance on 11 Jun 2020 (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.23.2001005; see ref 1). From the said paper we present a segment addressing cats:

"A total of 24 stray cats found in the surroundings of (2 farms) were sampled for SARS-CoV-2 infection by collecting serum and oropharyngeal swabs. 7 cats had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, detected by an in-house virus microneutralisation assay, and one cat was positive for viral RNA. However, the amounts of viral RNA were very small, and we were unable to generate a sequence from this cat. The sampled stray cats inhabit the surroundings of the farms, but do not come into the houses of people." The COVID-19 in cats issue has become subject to a research project, currently cooperatively applied by 3 Dutch institutions.
