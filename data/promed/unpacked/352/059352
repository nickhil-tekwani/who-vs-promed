Since the end of September 2007, the province of Katanga has faced a
recrudescence of cases of cholera. On 17 Dec 2007, the epicenter of
the cholera epidemic developed in the town of Likasa, an important
crossroads between various urban centers.

For weeks one to 7 of this year [2008], 5483 cases of cholera were
declared in Katanga and 120 deaths occurred (2.18 percent). Since
week 7, the epidemiologic curve tended to fall to Lubumbashi and
Likasi.

To date, cholera activity has concentrated especially around 2 urban
centers (Lubumbashi and Likasi). However the propagation of the
disease continues and 5 health zones (Fungurume, Kabondo-Dianda,
Kapolowe, Manika, and Panda) have a curve of ascending evolution of
the epidemic.

[2] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Mashonaland East)
Date: Tue 4 Mar 2008

At least 14 cases of the deadly cholera have been reported in Harare
in the past 2 weeks, the Minister of Health and Child Welfare, Dr
David Parirenyatwa, has said. So far, 9 cases were reported at the
Waterfalls Refugee Transit Camp while another 5 were reported in
Epworth. Dr Parirenyatwa said no deaths had been recorded so far.

Investigations are underway to establish the origins of the cholera
cases at the Waterfalls camp. "We want to establish the route
traveled by the refugees," he said.

The minister said the 5 cases in Epworth were traced to Mudzi, which
was recently hit by an outbreak that claimed 7 lives in Nyakuyo
Village. A woman who visited Mozambique was suspected to have brought
the disease.

In February 2008, another 9 cases were reported in Kairezi and
Chadereka villages in Mashonaland Central. One person died.

[4] Acute watery diarrhea - Somalia (Gedo)

An outbreak of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) in and around the town of
Belet Hawo, southwestern Somalia, has killed at least 11 people in
the past 3 weeks, medical sources said on 28 Feb 2008. "11 people
have so far died in Belet Hawo hospital and the villages around it,"
Saaid Mohamed Samatar, a doctor with the Gedo Health Consortium
(GHC), said.

The district commissioner of Belet Hawo, Ahmed Mohamed Burkuus, said
a taskforce had been set up 2 weeks ago to deal with the outbreak,
mounting a campaign to warn people against drinking water that had
not been chlorinated. "We are using radio to inform people on what to
do to fight the spread of the disease," he said. "We have managed to
put chlorine in all the water wells."

Samatar said 263 cases of acute watery diarrhea had been reported
since the end of January 2008. He said the highest number of cases
was 80 per week but that was now declining. "This week we only
registered 15 cases."

In a report issued on 28 Feb 2008, the World Health Organization
(WHO) confirmed the cases of suspected AWD reported from Belet Hawo
in Gedo region.

Belet Hawo is close to the Kenya-Somalia border, not far from Mandera
town (northeastern Kenya), with frequent movement between the 2
towns. A recent outbreak of cholera in Mandera may be contributing to
the outbreak in Belet Hawo, said Samatar of the GHC.

Burkuus said there was a serious water shortage in the area and
people were drinking water "that they normally would not." He said
people and livestock were coming to the town in search of water.
"Livestock has started dying due to a lack of water and pasture."

[5] Cholera - Angola (Cunene)

Cholera is on the increase in Cunene Province in the South of Angola.
Since January 2008, due to heavy rainfall resulting in floods, some
12 980 people have been displaced in the village of Sangongo and the
provincial capital Ondgiva. 5 to 7 new cholera cases are reported
daily, 82 people have already died.

Angolan Red Cross (ARC) volunteers are working together with local
communities to take precautions. "The construction of latrines is
urgently needed," said Walter Bombo Guange Quifica, Red Cross
secretary general based in Angola's capital Luanda. The ARC formed
partnerships with other agencies to respond to the crisis and 100
latrines in the affected area have already been built in cooperation
with Oxfam.

This year's [2008] floods have also affected Moxico province in East
Angola and the northern province of Uige. While Angola in 2007
experienced the worst floods around Moxico, currently the most
affected area is the south of the country around Cunene Province.

[6] Cholera - Myanmar (Mon), IDPs
Date: Tue 4 Mar 2008

So far, 61 internally displaced persons (IDPs) of Mon ethnicity have
contracted cholera in Ananbon village in eastern Myanmar (Burma), an
area controlled by the New Mon State Party (NMSP).

According to an NMSP health program coordinator in Sangkhlaburi,
Thailand, 45 Mon persons were diagnosed with cholera this morning [4
Mar 2008], while the other 16 contracted the bacterium over the past
2 days. According to a local resident 2 cholera patients died last
week in the village. The clinic in Ananbon village has been so
overcrowded that patients have had to be moved to Jagatrao village,
an hour's walk from their homes.

Infected persons are being treated by medics at NMSP-funded clinics
in the 2 villages. Mon health care authorities in Sangkhlaburi
yesterday [3 Mar 2008] sent 200 bottles of glucose to the clinics.

According to a Mon health worker, today [4 Mar 2008] they will send
another 200 bottles of glucose injections. He said that the clinics
do not have enough medicine, but that he would ask the Thai
government hospital in Sangkhlaburi for emergency aid.

Cholera spread so quickly because villagers do not cover the toilet
after they use it, he added. This is the 1st time cholera has been so
widespread in the area.

Many people in Mon State lack information about health care. The
international medical organization, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)
left the area in December 2005 due to a dispute with government
authorities over travel restrictions. However, MSF opened a malaria
clinic in Sangkhlaburi in mid-2007 to treat and diagnose Mon patients.

Mon refugees first crossed into Thailand in 1990 following fighting
between the Burmese army and the NMSP. Initially, local Thai
authorities allowed the Mon people to stay in refugee camps. Then,
with the help of international aid agencies, the refugees were able
to establish their own camps near Sangkhlaburi.

The NMSP reached a ceasefire agreement with the Burmese government in
1995. According to a 2004 Burmese Border Consortium report, there are
some 40 000 Mon refugees internally displaced or in temporary
settlements inside Burma.
