I noticed in your preamble that you haven't taken on board the up-date on
the taxonomy of Orthomyxoviridae as accepted in Jerusalem [The most recent
ICTV meeting. The genus "influenza A,B virus" has been separated into two
distinct genera: _Influenzavirus A_ and _Influenzavirus B_.

[Cornelia has up-dated ICTV web site to reflect these changes. The address
of that site is: <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTV/up5.htm>. There are now
four genera within the family Orthomyxoviridae: _Influenzavirus A_,
_Influenzavirus B_, _Influenzavirus C-, and _Thogotovirus_. - Mod.CHC
