At least 7 people have died of suspected anthrax in the past 2 months at Tungri Tola basti in Simdega district [Jharkhand state], a senior health official said. In the presence of chief secretary Sajal Chakraborty here today, director medical services Dr Suman Mishra said, "7 persons had died in 2 months."

Dr Ramesh Prasad, director of State integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, said samples were sent to Delhi for pathological tests to confirm whether the deaths were caused by anthrax. He said 2 people died on [18 Oct 2014], and the symptoms on the bodies suggested anthrax. "The people, mostly tribals, said when a couple of bullocks died they ate their meat," Prasad said. Thereafter, they were afflicted with symptoms later on, Prasad said, adding the basti has a total of about 23 families. The victims also vomited blood, complained of chest and stomach ache after consuming the animal meat, he added. "The symptoms showed that the disease is in the category that is curable," he added. The chief secretary, who visited the place today, said preventive measures were taken like providing antibiotics to the people of the basti, keeping kerosene and wood to burn cattle carcasses and restricting cattle from moving to adjoining areas.

[Jharkhand is a state in eastern India that was carved out of the southern part of Bihar on 15 Nov 2000. Up until 2000, anthrax was reported to OIE as a regular livestock problem. Since Jharkhand arrived on the scene, there has been a total silence. Presumably it is still there, but is just not reported. This news report seems to be an exception, though the cause of death of these 7 has yet to be confirmed.

The background of tribals butchering and eating 2 sick bullocks is unfortunately far too common in India, and elsewhere. It is informative that this report covers nothing on any veterinary response, even if only retroactive vaccination of the village livestock. The best and most cost effective preventative for human anthrax is routine annual vaccination of the livestock. Besides preventing human cases, it also improves the rural economy by preventing livestock deaths, and especially of valuable adult cattle.
