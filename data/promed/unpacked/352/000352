Meningococcal disease in Scotland in 1998 illustrates need for vaccination
The number of cases of invasive meningococcal disease notified in Scotland
rose by 18% (from 264 to 313) between 1997 and 1998 (1). The age specific
incidence increased in children aged 5 to 9 years and more than doubled in
those aged 10 to 14 years. Sixty-two of the 134 strains of _Neisseria
meningitidis_ examined were of serogroup C (46%; 90% of which were serotype
C:2a), exceeding the 58 isolates of group B (43%). The increasing number of
cases, particularly among schoolchildren, and the increasing proportion of
cases caused by group C infection make the new vaccination programme
against group C meningococcal infection in the United Kingdom especially
welcome (2,3).
Data recently published by the European Meningitis Surveillance Group show
that the incidence of meningococcal disease throughout Europe from 1993 to
1996 was 1.1 cases per 100 000 population (4); the incidence in Scotland at
that time was 2.3/100 000, reflecting a geographical trend towards higher
rates in northern countries (4). The highest age specific incidence in
Europe was in children under 1 year of age and about half the cases were
aged under 5 years, but a significant shift in age distribution towards the
15 to 19 year age group occurred (4). The overall case fatality rate was
8.3%. Group B infections accounted for 68% of cases in Europe from 1993 to
1996, whereas group C caused 28%, but group C's share increased from 26% in
1993 to 32% in 1996, while group B's fell from 71% to 62% over the same
period (4).
