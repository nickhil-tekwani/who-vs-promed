The Department of Health (DOH) on Sat, 1 Oct 2005, confirmed another outbreak
of cholera, this time in the province of Catanduanes in the Bicol region. Dr.
Eric Tayag, director of the DOH National Epidemiology Center, told ANC that
there are now 180 cholera cases with 5 fatalities in the town of San Andres,
Catanduanes. The DOH had earlier confirmed a similar outbreak in Caramoan,
Camarines Sur.

"There's an outbreak of cholera in San Andres, Catanduanes. The
epidemiologists sent by the DOH are still conducting investigations, and there
might be an association of cases from Caramoan, Camarines Sur, which is just
across Catanduanes, he said. Tayag added: "Doctors are looking at the
possibility of person-to-person transmission or common source transmission for
the 180 cases."
Tayag also said doctors have already taken stool samples from affected
residents. The samples are now being examined in laboratories. He advised
residents in both San Andres and Caramoan to purify water prior to
consumption. He said chlorine must be used in areas where residents have no
facilities to boil water for drinking.

[2] Cholera, diarrhea - Philippines (Catanduanes, Camarines Sur)

The Department of Health regional office here Wed, 5 Oct 2005, declared a
diarrhea outbreak in the entire Catanduanes province, with 457 cases and 14
deaths reported from 2 Aug to 3 Oct 2005. 16 persons have also died due to
diarrhea in Caramoan, Camarines Sur. The regional DOH also reported a cholera
outbreak in the towns of San Andres in Catanduanes and Caramoan in Camarines
Sur.
This prompted DOH Bicol director Nestor Santiago Jr. to send more medical
teams to the 2 provinces to augment medical supplies and personnel and conduct
daily checks in the areas, according to the DOH Center for Health and
Development. Dr. Alan Locanes, DOH regional coordinator for food and water-
borne diseases, said 30 persons had died of diarrhea.
>From 2 Aug to 4 Oct 2005, at least 239 diarrhea cases and 6 deaths had been
reported in San Andres; 159 cases and 3 deaths in Virac, 16 cases and a death
in Caramoan; 15 cases and 3 deaths in Baras; 15 cases in Pandan; 8 cases and a
death in Bato; and 5 cases in Viga -- all in Catanduanes. But Locanes said
the outbreak had been contained, with daily admissions in hospitals down to
about 6 to 7 cases per day from 30 to 32 cases per day.
"Even with the decreasing [numbers of] diarrhea cases in hospitals, we still
have to be vigilant. It may be contained, but it's not yet 'fire out'," he
said. 3 medical teams and 6 nurses, including an epidemiologic surveillance
unit, were deployed to Catanduanes, he added. The teams were stationed at the
Juan M. Alberto District Hospital.
A medical team was also sent to Caramoan, Camarines Sur, where 306 cases of
diarrhea had been reported from 1 Jun to 4 Oct 2005. Of Caramoan's 49
barangays, 36 were affected, Locanes said.

At least 30 people have died after a cholera outbreak struck the impoverished
Bicol region of the Philippines, health officials said yesterday, 6 Oct 2005.
16 deaths have been reported near the coastal town of Caramoan, 325 kilometers
(200 miles) southeast of Manila, since Jun 2005, officials said, while 14
other deaths have been reported on the island of Catanduanes, east of
Caramoan, since Aug 2005.
No new deaths have been reported for the past 5 days and there has been
a "significant reduction in the number of cases," Enrique Tayag, chief of the
health department's National Epidemiology Center, told AFP. "We have sent a
team down there," Tayag said. "They are instituting control measures."
At least 805 cases have been documented in Caramoan and in 13 towns on
Catanduanes, the official said. Thus far, 25 of the 30 fatalities have been
confirmed to be caused by the _Vibrio cholerae_ bacterium, the official
added. Confirmation of the other 5 cases was pending.

Cholera has killed 294 patients out of the 1868 cases reported in Guinea-
Bissau, according to the director general of public health, Tome Ca. But Tome
Ca said the number of cases had considerably declined in Bissau and upcountry,
except in Quinara.
Tome Ca commended Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) for its important role in
combating the infection. An epidemic of cholera has persisted in Guinea-Bissau
since the 1st case was detected 11 Jun 2005.

[The variation in case fatality rates is striking, from zero out of 290 in
Mauritania to 70/3 471 for Uganda. One wonders how treatment, and perhaps
biotype and serotype, differ between countries. ProMED would appreciate more
information on this and also regarding the 2 imported cases of cholera in the
USA, such as type and provenance. - Mod.LL/JW]
