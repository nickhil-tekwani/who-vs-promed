LYME DISEASE - USA: (MAINE) INCREASED INCIDENCE

Maine health officials report back-to-back increases in confirmed or
probable cases of Lyme disease in 2007 and 2008. The Maine Center for
Disease Control and Prevention said there were more than 900 cases of
the tick-borne illness in humans last year [2008], an increase of 72
percent. In 2007, there was a 57 [percent] increase, the Maine Center
for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Lyme disease is caused by bacteria that are transmitted to humans
through the bite of an infected deer tick. Most common in southern and
coastal Maine, Lyme disease is gradually moving up the state.

While the disease often causes symptoms such as joint pain and
fatigue, it's much more serious for some people. For some, it brings
fevers and meningitis-type symptoms. Sometimes, it's difficult to
confirm a diagnosis. "When we're fortunate and people show up and tell
us that they've had a tick [bite], and then they get the rash and the
rash is an expanding red rash at the site of the bite, that's an easy
diagnosis. The problem is, most people don't remember a tick
attachment and not everyone gets a rash," said Dr Bea Szantyr, a
Lincoln-based physician who specializes in educating people about Lyme
disease. Gordon Smith, director of the Maine Medical Association, said
it's not uncommon for patients to disagree with some of the treatment
decisions their doctors make.

Doctors had difficulty diagnosing what was wrong with a Brunswick
teenager after she suffered an ear infection, 105.4 deg F [40.8 deg C]
fever and meningitis-type symptoms, loss of the use of the left side
of her body, and swelling on the right side. [Her] family could be
considered a high-risk for 2 reasons: they live in Cumberland County,
which along with York County has the most cases of Lyme disease in
Maine [both York and Cumberland are southeastern, coastal counties];
and because they spend a lot of time outside on their 40-acre [16 ha]
farm.

"We really don't want to move. We love Maine. We just know that our
choices to be outside people, farming, and landscaping, means we're
always going to have to keep a full-length mirror in our bathroom and
be like the primates and chimpanzees and pick each other for ticks,"
said [the teenager's] mother.

[Lyme disease is distributed focally within the United States: it is
considered endemic in 8 northeastern (Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island)
and 2 upper Midwestern (Wisconsin and Minnesota) states, where 93
percent of cases were reported during 2003-2005
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5623a1.htm>).

Lyme disease surveillance in Maine began in 1989 and the number of
Lyme disease cases has increased steadily since 2000. Over the same
period, incidence rates for the USA population were relatively stable
while rates for the entire New England region fluctuated but still
remained higher than those for Maine; case rates were highest for 3
southeastern, coastal counties (York, Lincoln, and Knox), with 71.2
cases per 100 000, 56.5 per 100 000, and 42.9 per 100 000, respectively
(<http://lymebook.com/blog/geographic-incidence/lyme-disease-in-maine-statistics-cases/>).
Some inland areas, including Kennebec County, have also experienced an
upsurge in reported cases, a phenomenon that is consistent with
ecological studies tracking changes in deer tick (_Ixodes scapularis_)
populations
(<http://lymebook.com/blog/geographic-incidence/lyme-disease-in-maine-statistics-cases/>).

_Borrelia burgdorferi_ (the cause of Lyme disease), _Anaplasma
phagocytophilum_ (the cause of human granulocytic anaplasmosis), and
_Babesia microti_ (the cause of babesiosis) share a common vector, the
deer tick
(<http://entnem.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/medical/deer_tick.htm>), which
along with the white-footed mouse
(<http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Peromyscus_leucopus.html>), maintain the organisms in nature, and as a result the diseases they produce have a common geographic distribution in the northeastern and upper Midwest USA, where this tick is commonly found. Patients with any one of the diseases transmitted by _Ixodes scapularis_ may also be concurrently infected with the other diseases transmitted by this
vector.

It should be noted that cases are reported by county of residence,
which is assumed to be the county of exposure. But people are often
exposed to infected ticks outside their county of residence.
