Health Minister Mashako Mamba announced on Friday that eight people had
died in August and September from what was believed to be a resurgence of
haemorrhagic fever in the Durba area of rebel-held Province Orientale, news
agencies said. The most recent victim was a Ugandan soldier who contracted
the disease in Durba and died days later in nearby Isiro, Mamba told
journalists in Kinshasa. The Associated Press (AP) quoted Mamba as saying
the situation was "alarming", and he urged that international pressure be
placed on Uganda to close Durba's Dorugba gold mine, believed to be the
source of the disease. Some 60 people, mainly mine workers, were estimated
to have died in the haemorrhagic fever outbreak that ended in May.
Meanwhile, samples collected from the victim in Isiro and tested last week
in a South African laboratory showed negative for haemorrhagic fever, an
official from WHO's regional office in Harare told IRIN on Monday. The
laboratory results showed that the soldier in Isiro "died from something
other than haemorrhagic fever", the official said. However, additional
samples have been collected from the area and efforts were underway to
transport them to South Africa for further testing, he added.

[In response to an inquiry, Professor Bob Swanepoel (Special Pathogens
Unit, National Institute for Virology, Sandringham, Republic of South
Africa) sent the following clarification and extension:
1) Eight patients were positive by isolation of virus in the original Durba
investigation (more than one isolation per patient from serial samples in
some instances).
2) The Isiro patient was negative for viral hemorrhagic fever tests -
including culture to date but we are still exploring differential diagnoses.
3) We have not received further specimens from Durba but we understand
there are difficulties.
4) PCR and culture tests for filoviruses on 170 specimens (mainly bats and
rodents) from a mine in Durba were negative but
5) Sequencing of the human isolates indicates that multiple lineages of
Marburg virus were/are circulating and it appears that some patients were
up to 20 km apart
with no obvious connection between them, so the mine/s may not be the
source of the virus after all, perhaps just a good place for human-to-human
spread of infection, but this is may not yet be the end of the road. -
