Here's another reason to stay inside and out of the heat, reported
cases of tick-borne diseases have jumped this year [2007] in
Missouri. Driven in large part by increased recognition from doctors
and more houses built in old forests, the diseases are being reported
at a rate far higher than the 5-year average.
The state has received reports of 117 cases of ehrlichiosis compared
to the annual average of 40; 186 cases of Rocky Mountain spotted
fever, compared with the normal 64; 18 cases of tularemia, compared
to 12; and 35 cases of Lyme disease instead of the usual 22.
State officials say cases are more common south of the Missouri
River, except for Boone County and Clay County.
Kansas has fewer wooded areas than Missouri, so the number of
reported cases is lower. Still, the 13 Kansas cases of tick-borne
diseases are more than double the normal amount.
Experts recommend avoiding wooded and bushy areas with tall grass,
wearing long pants and long sleeves and using insect repellents that
contain DEET.

[An increase in tick-transmitted diseases can be related to the
increased physician recognition/reporting and humans spending more
time in tick-infested areas but can also be due to other issues such
as milder winters and more wildlife in an area.
Missouri and Kansas are in the central part of the USA and can be
found on a state map at
