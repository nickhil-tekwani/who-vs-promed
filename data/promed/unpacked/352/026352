For the 1st time, a wild deer from Shawano County has tested positive for chronic wasting disease.

The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources says the doe was killed in the town of Germania during the recent gun deer season. DNR wildlife biologists say there are plenty of deer in the area, and a wild whitetail testing positive for CWD is not out of the question.

"Given the proximity to wild positives and some captive positives, we're going to continue to see the advancement in the presence of the disease," said Jeff Pritzl, DNR District Wildlife Supervisor.

Hunters we talked to say they are concerned.

"The CWD thing. It's just terrible. This area is huge. And it's full of deer. It's one of the best deer hunting in the state, I believe. It's got some of the nicest bucks," said [GH], Tigerton.

"I think eventually they're going to find more of them in the area. Because you got one out there, there's probably more, so they're going to be finding some in the future," said [DR], Tigerton.

"We are simply in the surveillance mode to follow up and find out if that was a unique event, or if there are more deer in the area," said Pritzl. "Down the road, if additional positive animals are discovered, as it has in some other parts of the state, then it changes the conversation a little bit to shift from surveillance to more of a management mode. But we're not there yet."

Because the location in southwestern Shawano County is within 10 mi [16.1 km] of Waupaca County, the DNR will renew the baiting and feeding bans in both counties, as required by law. Shawano County already had a baiting and feeding ban in place because a farm-raised deer tested positive for CWD in 2017.

The previously scheduled County Deer Advisory Council meeting for Shawano County to discuss deer population will be extended to include the new CWD information. The 19 Jan [2021] meeting, held over video chat, is open to the public. No pre-registration is required.

CWD is a fatal, contagious disease that affects the nervous systems of deer, moose, elk, and caribou. It was first detected in Wisconsin in 2002. No evidence of transmission from animals to humans has been found.

[This seems to be an area in Wisconsin where the disease has not previously been found. It is sad another area has succumbed to this disease.

It is likely we will see increased scrutiny on feeding stations and on surveillance in this area. It is also likely they will find more disease.
