The Israel Defense Forces on Mon, 2 Jan 2006, decided to inoculate
some 500 recruits at the Zukei Uvda base in the Negev against
pneumonia, due to an outbreak of the disease last week. So far 14
soldiers have contracted the illness. One of the soldiers has been
admitted in serious condition to Hadassah University Hospital Ein
Kerem in Jerusalem, and another soldier who is also in serious
condition is hospitalized at Soroka Hospital in Be'er Sheva.
IDF sources said that the inoculations are a precaution to prevent
additional spread of the disease. The army is expected to decide
whether to have the recruits, who are to join the engineering corps
after finishing basic training, return to the base on the weekend or
to wait for next week.
The recruits were sent to their homes last Thu, 29 Dec 2005. Soldiers
from other unit are still serving as usual at the base.

may well have been caused by _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ - Mod.LM]

[Clonal outbreaks of invasive pneumococcal infection with additional
individuals carrying the same serotype can occur. In the
pre-antibiotic period, epidemic pneumococcal disease was observed in
a variety of settings including military training centers,
psychiatric hospitals, and correctional institutions (1,2).
Pneumococcal outbreaks are rarely reported now, although 2 epidemics
have occurred in shelters for homeless men (3,4).
Additionally, an outbreak of invasive infection due to _S.
pneumoniae_, including cases of primary septicemia and meningitis as
well as pneumonia, was described in 12 inmates of an overcrowded jail
in Texas in 1989 (5). All patients were male; their mean age was 30
(range: 19-53) years. 5 additional inmates with pneumonia had _S.
pneumoniae_ isolated from sputum specimens. All isolates from the 17
patients were serotype 12. 14 patients had underlying conditions
including alcoholism and intravenous-drug abuse, cirrhosis, and
asplenia. Only one inmate had been previously immunized with
pneumococcal vaccine.
More recently, in 1998, an outbreak of multidrug-resistant pneumonia
and bacteremia was described among unvaccinated nursing home
residents (6). Pneumonia developed in 11 of 84 residents (13
percent), 3 of whom died. Multidrug-resistant _S. pneumoniae_,
serotype 23F, was isolated from blood and sputum from 7 of the 11
residents with pneumonia (64 percent) and from nasopharyngeal
specimens from 17 of the 74 residents tested (23 percent) and 2 of
the 69 employees tested (3 percent). All the serotype 23F isolates
were identical according to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Recent
use of antibiotics was associated with both colonization (relative
risk, 2.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 4.2) and disease
(relative risk, 3.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 10.8).
Only 3 residents (4 percent) had undergone pneumococcal vaccination.
After residents received pneumococcal vaccine and prophylactic
antibiotics, there were no additional cases of pneumonia, and the
rates of carriage decreased substantially.
Additionally, a 1996 outbreak in a NY nursing home was discussed in
ProMED (see 19960430.0828 below).
