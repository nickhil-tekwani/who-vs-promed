Paraguay reports "greening" outbreak in citrus plantations
----------------------------------------------------------
Paraguay's plants and seeds sanitary office, SENAVE, has reported 63 outbreaks of "greening" or HLB [huanglongbing] in citrus groves. It further admits that the geographical dissemination of the bacterial disease is in "an advanced stage", despite all institutional efforts.

"We need to implement a national programme with a strong presence of national authorities to avoid the disappearance of the country's citrus production," warned Fernando Rios, SENAVE.

HLB has devastated citrus production in several countries such as in Florida (United States), Cuba [1st report 2008, ProMED-mail post 20080829.2707], and in Brazilian states of Sao Paulo and Parana, where Paraguayan authorities believe the contagion was introduced from into the land-locked country.

[Huanglongbing (HLB), or citrus greening, caused by the fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacterium _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus occurs throughout much of Asia. It is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops. The disease is restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of its vector; 2 other related pathogens, _Ca._ L. africanus (including a subsp. capensis) and _Ca._ L. americanus and their specific vectors exist in the respective areas. HLB has not been reported from the Mediterranean region or Australia.

The disease affects both leaves and fruits. Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves and small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel, and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers, and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit.

_Ca._ L. asiaticus is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_), but it is also often spread by grafting and possibly seed transmission, and with infected plant material to areas where the vector is already present. Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards, and biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Biological control by interplanting of guava is being trialled (ProMED-mail post 20070912.3018).

_Ca._ L. asiaticus was reported for the 1st time in the Americas from neighbouring Brazil in 2004 (ProMED-mail post 20040723.2012). At that time, in the state of Sao Paulo the pathogen was present in about 5 per cent of citrus trees and _Ca._ L. americanus (which shares the same vector) in 95 per cent of trees. However, by 2008 more trees were infected with _Ca._ L. asiaticus which is thought to be due to this species being more heat tolerant. Millions of HLB affected citrus trees have been eradicated in the country, but HLB continues to spread in the region.

Argentina, Paraguay's neighbour in the south, has reported HLB for the 1st time in 2012 (ProMED-mail post 20120917.1296650) in an area bordering on Brazil. Regulations to prevent the spread of the disease have been activated.
