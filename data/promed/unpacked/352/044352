The Ministry of Environment, Agriculture, and Livestock, informs the public that Rift Valley Fever [RVF] has been diagnosed for the first time in Burundi in cattle, sheep, and goats. This [has been indicated] by the Director-General of Livestock, Mr. Serge Nkurunziza, in a press release.

Given that RVF is a zoonotic disease that can be transmitted to humans through contact with the blood of an affected animal, he invited the Ministry of Public Health to take steps to collaborate with his ministry to conduct joint monitoring.

According to him, it was towards the end of April [2022] that cases of this initially unknown disease, with an unusual clinical picture, were reported in Kirundo and Ngozi provinces in cattle.

There were reports of numerous cases of abortions, nasal bleeding and hyperthermia, diarrhea often mixed with blood, generalized weakness, lack of appetite, and conjunctival hemorrhages, which in most cases ended in the death of affected animals. Apart from the symptom of abortion, of note, all ages and sexes in cattle are affected.

Since the onset of the disease, 100 cattle deaths have been recorded. Following these alerts, the Directorate General for Livestock via the National Veterinary Laboratory carried out investigation visits on [30 Apr 2022] and [9 May 2022] respectively, after which blood samples from sick animals were collected.

Based on information from the field as well as clinical suspicions, the first laboratory analyses focused on the search for fleas. The results revealed that 4 of the samples were positive for that [parasite].

However, given the unusual clinical picture, other analyses were conducted to look for other possible causes. The results of the haematological examinations combined with the clinical manifestation made it possible to suspect hemorrhagic fevers such as Rift Valley fever, Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD), Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis as well as the bacterial anthrax.

It is in this context that the first analyses with the molecular biology technique focused on Rift Valley fever for which the reagents were still available.

At the end of those analyses, the samples tested were positive. Currently, the disease has spread to other provinces namely Kayanza, Karusi, Cibitoke, Bujumbura and Makamba. While the molecular analyses were underway, multidisciplinary animal health experts were dispatched to all these provinces for further epidemiological investigations. The teams confirmed the clinical signs reported by the field services. Mortalities and abortions also concern small ruminants.

The first reported cases are generally located in cross-border areas. Clinical cases continue to be observed.

Mr. Serges Nkurunziza calls on-field technicians to take all the necessary precautions for individual protection, particularly in terms of biosecurity. Breeders must inform the technical services of all clinical cases for their support.

The monitoring of the evolution of the disease continues at all levels; breeders are requested to regularly spray all animals with phytosanitary products.

In the affected areas, the restriction of all movement for ruminants and the ban on their slaughter must be respected until further notice.

A total of 464 cases of cows with Rift Valley fever [RVF] disease are already recorded across the country. A statement was made on [Tue 24 May 2022] by the Director-General of Animal Health within the Ministry in charge of Livestock, Dr. Désiré Ntakirutimana.

According to him, it is especially the northern provinces of Burundi such as Kirundo, Muyinga, and Ngozi that are the most affected by this disease which can be transmitted by a vector, by direct contact, or through different types of mosquitoes.

Among the 464 cases of cows with RVF recorded and confirmed after laboratory analysis, some have died. So far, he insists, the ban on trade in animals, the movement of livestock, and the slaughter of animals only concern the affected areas. If there are other additional measures to be taken, the population will be informed.

The DG indicated that awareness and vaccination campaigns will soon begin. However, he said they are still waiting for funding.

[The difficulties Burundi's field veterinarians and laboratory personnel encountered in the diagnosis of the RVF event in cattle during its early stages are not exceptional. Signs of the disease tend to be nonspecific, rendering it difficult to recognise individual cases during epidemics. Some animals may have inapparent infections, while others have severe clinical diseases with mortality and abortion. Susceptible, older non-pregnant animals often do not show signs of disease. In addition, the susceptibility of different species and breeds to RVF may vary considerably. In most cases, RVF was initially suspected by the occurrence of numerous abortions and mortalities among young animals (sheep, goat, and cattle in the same order of susceptibility), together with the disease in humans: this is the characteristic presentation of RVF. In many events, humans were the sentinels allowing the discovery of an epizootic in livestock that had already been circulating, unnoticed. The (apparent?) absence of disease in humans, in Burundi, has contributed to missing RVF initially.

RVF diagnostic techniques are described in detail in OIE's Manual, chapter 3.1.18 (version adopted in May 2016), available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.01.18_RVF.pdf.

Information on the lab technique(s) applied in Burundi, and detailed results, will be helpful. -Mod.AS
