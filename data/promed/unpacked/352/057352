Having read the information available on the website of the Rhode Island
Department of Health, it is apparent that an unusual experiment is being
conducted in the state. Routine use of the meningococcal vaccine has never
before been carried out in a civilian population. The vaccine has
previously only been used for control of outbreaks (clusters of cases in a
relatively small population such as school, university, town) or epidemics
(as in China, New Zealand, Finland, Brazil, many parts of Africa, and
elsewhere).
The Rhode Island experiment has a very high probability of succeeding in
that the rate of meningococcal disease, which peaks in February and March,
will decline over the next few months, regardless of whether or not routine
vaccination is carried out. However no useful information about the
effectiveness of the vaccine will be gained from this experiment since
there does not appear to be an outbreak of either group A, C, or Y disease
occurring in Rhode Island. However, if group B cases continue to occur at
the same rate (almost 30% of the cases in 1997), the Rhode Island
experiment has a good probability of giving the meningococcal vaccine a bad
reputation among the public.
Another example of use of meningococcal vaccine in Canada: an outbreak of
group C disease occurred in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, with 5 cases
between 12/3/97 and 12/13/97 (1 death). An additional fatal case occurred
on 12/26 and a 7th case on 1/4/98. All 7 cases were adolescents and young
adults, 16-23 years of age. Immunization clinics for all those 2-22 years
of age began on 12/20/97, with wrap-up clinics for catch-up on 1/24/97.
Overall 100,000 people were immunized. As in previous vaccine campaigns in
Ontario in response to outbreaks of group C disease, this one appears to
have been successful.
