Cambodia reported 4434 dengue fever cases in the 1st 5 months of this year [2012], an increase of 340 per cent from 1007 cases reported during the same period last year [2011], Ngan Chantha, director of the health ministry's dengue control program, said on Thursday [7 Jun 2012].

From January to May 2012, the disease killed 21 children, up from only 8 deaths at the same period last year [2011], he told Xinhua over telephone.

"The disease bursts out in a large scale in every 5 years -- this year [2012] can be the large scale outbreak of the disease," Ngan Chantha said, citing the large-scale outbreak in 2007 with 40 000 reported cases, killing 407 children.

To prevent the outbreak this year [2012], he said, about 270 tones of abate (a chemical substance used to kill larvae in water pots) are being distributed free of charge to households.

He also appealed to people to sleep under mosquito nets and keep clean environment around their houses.

Dengue is [transmitted] by mosquitoes. The disease causes an acute illness of sudden onset that usually follows symptoms such as headache, fever, exhaustion, severe muscle and joint pain, swollen glands, and rash.

In Cambodia, outbreaks of dengue fever usually begin at the onset of the rainy season in May and last until October.

Last year [2011], the country reported 15 980 dengue fever cases, killing 73 children.
