A/H1N1 pandemic flu vaccine withdrawn in Canada due to high number of
allergic reactions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
About 170 000 doses of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccine are
being withdrawn in Canada from Friday [20 Nov 2009] after health
officials reported an unusually high number of allergic reactions.
Health officials in the western province of Manitoba reported
Thursday [19 Nov 2009] a higher-than-usual number of allergic
reactions after using vaccine from a batch manufactured by a factory
of the British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in Quebec. Usually one
or 2 allergic reactions are expected for a batch of that size, but
Manitoba has recorded 6 severe allergic reactions.

GSK said Friday in a statement that the recall was a precaution and
they would investigate to see whether there was something wrong with
the batch. Another province which has been using the vaccine did not
report any rise in adverse reactions.

Of the 6.6 million people that had been vaccinated, there have been
36 serious adverse reactions, Dr. David Butler-Jones, the country's
Chief Public Health Officer, said earlier this week. One person was
believed to have died from a serious reaction to the vaccine, but the
death had not been conclusively linked to the flu shot, he said.

[This report is posted for the record. In view of the absence of
reactions in a different Canadian province using the same vaccine and
the low incidence of allergic reaction reported globally so far, it
is unlikely that there is a systemic problem with the GSK vaccine.
More likely these allergic reactions reflect a problem with a single
batch of the vaccine, or problems at the level of vaccine administration.

Normal reactions to influenza vaccines include a sore arm and mild
flu-like symptoms for a short period of time after injection of the
vaccine. In general influenza vaccines, including the pandemic (H1N1)
2009 virus vaccine, are cultured in eggs, and in very rare cases
there may be an anaphylactic reaction to egg protein.
