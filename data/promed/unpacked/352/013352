In a follow-up on a recent report on measles in Brazil, a new case of measles registered in São Paulo turned on the alerts among the health authorities: It was the 3rd record of indigenous transmission since February [2022], without connection to each other, according to a Folha de S. Paulo report [in Portuguese, https://bit.ly/3JHWrbL].

There is fear of a new outbreak of the disease, and the government of São Paulo is already preparing a campaign to encourage the vaccination of children up to 5 years, the target population of the immunization.

The case was confirmed this week in Santos, the same city where another patient had been diagnosed with the disease last month [March 2022]. In February [2022], another person with measles was identified in the city of São Paulo.

In 2016, Brazil received the official certificate of eradication of the disease, which was attributed to widespread vaccination of the population. Just 3 years later, in 2019, the joy ended and the country witnessed a new outbreak of the disease. The reason: Vaccination coverage plummeted, from 95% in that year to around 72%.

The concern about a new outbreak of the disease in São Paulo is enormous, since measles vaccination coverage has also been falling in the state. In 2018 it came to 81.8% of children up to 5 years old. In 2019, the percentage dropped to 82.5%, in 2020 to 67.1%, and in 2021 to 60.1%, when considering the 2nd dose of the vaccine.

A vaccination campaign launched by the Ministry of Health in East Darfur to stem a measles outbreak and increase the protection of children's lives through immunisation, is being supported by international medical relief organisation Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF). The initiative targets about 30 000 children, including South Sudanese refugees, between 6 months and 15 years.

According to a statement by MSF on Tuesday [12 Apr 2022], hundreds of suspected cases of measles have been reported across East Darfur since early 2022. MSF received the 1st suspected measles patient in Kario camp primary healthcare centre (PHCC) at the beginning of January. By the end of March [2022], PHCC received many patients who were exhibiting the symptoms of measles and managing the cases accordingly, the statement says.

"This vaccination campaign is targeting both the South Sudanese refugees in Kario camp and the host communities in the nearby El Ferdous and Bahr El Arab localities," underlines Topher Mongeon, the project coordinator of MSF in East Darfur. "While the campaign is an initiative of the Ministry of Health, MSF is covering the costs for medical staff and transportation means, as well as ensuring the cold chain."

Through this vaccination campaign, the health authorities and MSF are also aiming to strengthen the surveillance system at health facility and community level. This should allow for better management and treatment of all detected cases as per measles treatment protocol, increase the awareness about measles prevention among the communities and reactivate the community's role in health awareness raising, the MSF statement explains.

MSF runs a PHCC in Kario refugee camp that provides outpatient consultations, inpatient paediatrics, and therapeutic feeding centre (ITFC) for severe malnutrition, as well as reproductive health services. The PHCC serves both host population of the surrounding villages as well as the South Sudanese refugees living in the camp. MSF has been present in Kario, East Darfur since 2017.

More than 1000 cases of measles were recorded in Sokoto from January to date [13 Apr 2022]. The disease was reported to have killed some children in Dan Madi, Kaurare and Aljannare villages in the Tambuwal local government area (LGA) of the state.

The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Mohammad Ali Inname, who disclosed this in an interview with newsmen, regretted that the outbreak was recorded despite intense immunisation campaigns in the state. "We have 500 centres providing routine immunisation across the state and were adequately stocked with vaccines," he said.

According to him, the outbreak was observed among unvaccinated children. He added that there were vaccinated children who were also affected but with a mild form of the disease.

"Despite all the proactive measures put in place by the global health authorities, including Nigerian government at both national and the state levels, there are still people with a misunderstanding of vaccination exercise, resulting in waves of the outbreak in the state," he said.

He said that teams from the state and local government areas deployed to affected areas confirmed it was a measles outbreak but it was brought under control. The affected communities were provided with measles vaccines for reactive vaccination, as well as responsive drugs for symptomatic treatment of the affected persons.
