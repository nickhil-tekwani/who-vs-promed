Re:
"... It has also caused problems for people with HIV having an FIV-
positive cat, because of the susceptibility of transmission to the
person... - Mod.TG"
I fear that there may be some confusion regarding the moderator's
comments on FIV-infected cats owned by HIV-infected owners. The
Above comment suggests that FIV can be transmitted to humans.
While some work has been done infecting human and primate cell lines
with FIV (for instance, Johnston JB, Power C. Feline immuno-
deficiency virus xenoinfection: the role of chemokine receptors and
envelope diversity. J Virol. 2002 Apr; 76(8):3626-36.), I am not aware
of any literature reporting FIV infections in humans. I assume the
moderator intended to suggest that similar opportunistic infections may
be zoonotic and therefore a risk to the HIV-infected cat owner.
I certainly do not want to detract from the excitement of the vaccine
development -- it is significant and encouraging. Pet ownership,
however, can have a significant positive effect on ill patients and it
would be a disservice to suggest that FIV is a zoonotic disease.

[There have been several inquiries regarding my comments above. FIV
is not transmissible to human beings.
The intent of the statement was that immunosuppressed animals may
be more susceptible to diseases such as colds, salmonella infection,
methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ infection, some parasites,
and as such those diseases may be more easily transmitted to an
immunosuppressed person.
Cats with FIV may recover from the initial stages but are subject to
chronic secondary and opportunistic infections of the respiratory,
gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts, as well as the skin. - Mod.TG
