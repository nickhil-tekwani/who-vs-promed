A new case of leptospirosis was detected in the Prison Unit 11 of the industrial park. The location of the infectious source, where 3 inmates acquired this bacterial infection transmitted by rats, has already been checked out. One of the cases was fatal, but the other 2 affected individuals were timely treated with medications and now they are recovering. Public health authorities confirmed this information after a thorough inspection in which dogs, pigeons, and rats carrying the aforementioned infection had been found.

The new case is a man, who, together with 17 other inmates developed symptoms and had their (blood) samples taken for specialized studies at Castro Rendon health center [that is, Neuquen Provincial Hospital in Neuquen, Argentina; http://www.hospitalneuquen.org.ar]. Once the positive result for this man was confirmed, he received adequate therapy and his condition is currently improving. It is worth mentioning that leptospirosis can infect humans after contact with urine and stools [not stool. - Mod.ML] from infected animals.

Although this issue was tightly hidden, 2 weeks ago a writ of habeas corpus [a court appearance] took place, led by Ms Raquel Gass, the local Justice in charge. The inmates requested the reopening of workshops and instructive classes that had been suspended after the instructors refused to enter the affected facility because of lack of hygiene and for not complying with the minimal sanitary requirements. "The school was filled with rat feces; and the inspection revealed there were infected pigeons, rats, and dogs with this disease that is transmitted from animals to humans and not between human beings," according to judicial sources.

Ms Gass ordered preventive measures for the prison personnel, including using boots, gloves, mineral water, alcohol gel, and detergent. The Zoonosis Department also recommended filling the holes in the ducts, and ordered that refrigerators must be available for each section in a period not to exceed 30 days .

"There were 2 refrigerators donated by some inmates' relatives, only in 2 of the 11 sections in this prison; the inmates used to hang their meals from the [ceiling] in order to avoid contamination from rats," a spokesman revealed. Public Health professionals handed Mr Roberto Saldia, Director of Unit 11, a hygiene protocol in order to face the current situation and prevent new cases of this disease. The company in charge of the disinfection process and the Zoonosis Department will have to present monthly reports.

[_Leptospira_, the spirochetal bacteria that cause leptospirosis, are found in fresh water, damp soil, vegetation, and mud. _Leptospira_ survive best in fresh warm water. These bacteria cannot survive in salt water or freezing temperatures.

Chronically infected animals, which usually do not become ill, carry _Leptospira_ in their kidneys and excrete _Leptospira_ in their urine. Rats are a common source of leptospirosis. Humans become infected by contact with infected animal urine or water or food contaminated by infected animal urine.

For a discussion of leptospirosis, see the moderator's comments in the ProMED-mail postings below.

Neuquen, with a population of more than 265 000, making it the largest city in Patagonia, is the capital of the Argentine province of Neuquen (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuquen).
