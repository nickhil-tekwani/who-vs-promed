Rabies outbreak in Garcia, Nuevo Leon, Mexico
----------------------------------------------
In what will be the 1st attack by a rabies-infected animal in 30
years, a woman from the town of Garcia was bitten by a sick cat,
although the disease had been considered eradicated from Nuevo Leon.
The incident occurred last week [week of 20-24 Sep 2010] in the
district of Advance Popular, when a local inhabitant was suddenly
attacked by a stray cat. After getting bitten and scratched, the woman
managed to kill the animal.

The Mayor of Garcia, Jaime Rodriguez Calderon, revealed that
following the death of the cat the woman received emergency treatment
at the municipal 1st aid clinic, and the situation was immediately
reported to the Ministry of Health. Following the incident, the health
unit staff located the body of the cat which underwent laboratory
tests and was found to be positive for rabies virus infection. So the
woman concerned received post-exposure prophylaxis.

The mayor stated that: "The same day that rabies was confirmed an
intensive campaign of vaccination of dogs and cats, within a radius of
5 miles from where the incident occurred, was begun." The mayor stated
that bats living in the mountains surrounding Garcia were the probable
source of the infection. He estimated that following the detection of
the infected cat, about 3000 pets had been vaccinated so far, and that
128 stray dogs had been captured and euthanised and another 40
quarantined at the local pound.

The mayor stated that the situation was now under control and the
population of Garcia should no longer be alarmed.
