Abstract
--------
Although most invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) cases are sporadic without identified transmission links, outbreaks can occur. We report 3 cases caused by meningococcus B (MenB) at a Belgian nursery school over 9 months. The first 2 cases of IMD occurred in spring and summer 2018 in healthy children (aged 3-5 years) attending the same classroom [the 2nd case occurred 2 months after the 1st case]. Chemoprophylaxis was given to close contacts of both cases following regional guidelines. The 3rd case, a healthy child of similar age in the same class as a sibling of one case, developed disease in late 2018 [the 3rd case occurred 7 months after the 2nd case]. Microbiological analyses revealed MenB with identical finetype clonal complex 269 for Cases 1 and 3 (unavailable for Case 2) [Case 2 cerebrospinal fluid PCR positive for _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup B]. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed no antibiotic resistance. Following Case 3, after multidisciplinary discussion, chemoprophylaxis and 4CMenB (Bexsero) vaccination were offered to close contacts. In the 12-month follow-up of Case 3, no additional cases were reported by the school. IMD outbreaks are difficult to manage and generate public anxiety, particularly in the case of an ongoing cluster, despite contact tracing and management. This outbreak resulted in the addition of MenB vaccination to close contacts in Wallonian regional guidelines, highlighting the potential need and added value of vaccination in outbreak management.

[This report above describes an outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) due to meningococcus serogroup B (MenB) involving 3 children in a nursery school in Wallonia, Belgium, in 2018. Within 48 hours after each case occurred, ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis (a single dose of 15 mg/kg) was administered to all close contacts of each case. The strain was fluoroquinolone susceptible. However, the protection conferred by the single dose of ciprofloxacin was only temporary: In this particular nursery school outbreak, the 2nd and 3rd cases occurred several months after having received the chemoprophylaxis dose, suggesting the outbreak strain continued to circulate locally with reintroduction by an asymptomatic carrier of the outbreak strain who had not received antibiotic prophylaxis or who had been recolonized. This prompted the decision to vaccinate 2 nursery school classes after the 3rd case to achieve a more prolonged preventive effect conferred by meningococcal vaccination, in the face of continued transmission of MenB over an extended period.

In Wallonia, Belgium, vaccination against invasive meningococcal disease is given routinely only at 15 months of age for meningococcus serogroup C (MenC) (https://www.expatica.com/be/healthcare/healthcare-basics/vaccinations-in-belgium-105159/#Vaccination-System). In the USA, the CDC recommends all preteens (11-12 years of age) should receive a quadrivalent vaccine against serogroups A, C, W, and Y (MenACWY), with an MenACWY booster at 16-18 years of age; all teens (16-18 years of age) may also opt to get MenB vaccine (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/teen/parent-version-schedule-7-18yrs.pdf). MenACWY vaccine is given in 2 doses. MenB vaccine is given a 2- or 3-dose series. We are not told the vaccination status of the 3 cases in the nursery outbreak, but presumably they did not receive prior immunization against MenB.

According to the CDC, available data suggest that protection from MenACWY vaccines decreases in many teens within 5 years, so that the 16-year-old MenACWY booster dose is critical to provide protection when they are most at risk for meningococcal disease; data on MenB vaccines suggest that protection also declines within 1 to 2 years after vaccination (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mening/hcp/about-vaccine.html).

A large decline (over 90%) in the rates of IMD caused by serogroups C, Y, and W was seen in the teen population after introduction of MenACWY vaccine (MenA disease has been very rare in the USA). A large decline of IMD was not seen in other age-groups for which the CDC does not recommend routine MenACWY; this suggests MenACWY vaccines provide protection only to those vaccinated, probably not to the larger, unvaccinated community; that is, MenACWY vaccine does not provide herd immunity (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mening/hcp/about-vaccine.html). MenB vaccines, similarly, do not provide protection to the unvaccinated population (i.e., does not provide herd immunity). The absence of an effect of the vaccine on the unvaccinated population suggested to the Belgian authorities to vaccinate a wider range of close contacts in other classrooms. - Mod.ML
