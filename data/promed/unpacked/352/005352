Exotic Newcastle disease confirmed in the United States
-------------------------------------------------------
All information in the following Notice marked with an asterisk (*)
identifies changes since the last notice was sent out. Exotic Newcastle
disease (END) was confirmed on October 1, 2002, in the state of California,
and has now spread beyond backyard flocks to affect 20 commercial
operations in California. On January 16, 2003, END was also confirmed in a
backyard flock in the state of Nevada. A backyard flock was confirmed with
END on February 4, 2003, in the s tate of Arizona. Clinical signs in
infected birds include respiratory, nervous, and gastrointestinal signs.
Mortality is up to 90 per cent of exposed birds.
Investigations are ongoing and all figures are pending final validation.
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) personnel and other
federal government personnel are working with the States to consider
additional resources to meet the labor demands at the task forces. APHIS
has developed a plan for national END surveillance. This plan will enhance
the already extensive surveillance under way.

Operational update:
Effective 7 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates the
interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from
Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa
Barbara, and Ventura Counties, CA.
Effective January 17, 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that
regulates the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry
products from Clark and a portion of Nye County, NV. Effective February 10,
2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates the interstate
movement of all species of birds and poultry products from all of La Paz
and Yuma Counties and a portion of Mohave County, AZ.
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has declared an extraordinary
emergency for the states of Arizona, California, and Nevada. These
declarations allow USDA to apply federal authority within Arizona,
California, and Nevada.
Currently 20 commercial flocks in California are affected by END. The
breakdown of the commercial premises involved is as follows: 4 premises in
Riverside County (3 infected and 1 contact), 6 premises in San Diego County
(6 infected), and 10 premises in San Bernardino County (10 infected). * Of
the 2510 premises designated for depopulation, 93.8 per cent have been
completed.
The Inland Desert and South Coast incident command posts (ICPs) have
realigned their service territories so that all of Los Angeles County will
now be handled by the South Coast ICP. The South Coast ICP also will be
responsible for all of San Diego County, except in cases involving
commercial premises. Previously, the Inland Desert ICP handled portion of
Los Angeles County, as well as certain areas of San Diego County (both
backyard and commercial premises).
On March 12, 2003, an official from the president's Council on Homeland
Security and the deputy director of the Homeland Security Staff at USDA
visited the South Coast and Inland Desert ICPs to meet with area and
incident commanders and other personnel, as well as to view task force
operations first hand.
On March 10, 2003, the Central California Incident Command, as well as
representatives from Area Command, met with County Agriculture
Commissioners from the central California region. The focus of the meeting
was to explore ways that county personnel could be utilized to carry out
END surveillance. Personnel from Stanislaus County are already conducting
surveillance work based on a cooperative agreement with the END Task Force.
It is envisioned that similar agreements will be reached, as the need
arises, with other California counties in the region.
The Central Valley Incident Command Post in Modesto, CA, is staffed and
working cooperatively with about 15--20 county officials to implement
efficient surveillance measures throughout the Central Valley. The
Agriculture Multi-Agency Coordination (AgMAC) Group is scheduled to meet on
March 19, 2003, to discuss the END situation, resource availability, state
personnel legislation, and future personnel needs. The AgMAC is scheduled
to have follow-up meetings weekly to address these issues and any
additional issues as they emerge.
Task force personnel, in close collaboration with the California State
Highway Patrol, have agreed to establish an inspection station at the
commercial truck weighing station on Interstate 5 at Castaic. Personnel
will perform visual inspections of commercial vehicles that contain birds
or poultry. Further, California State Highway Patrol officers will remain
alert for commercial poultry vehicles they see in and around quarantine
zones and those officers will notify the task force with any information
pertinent to the task force mission.
Outreach Activities
Under a new task force direct mail campaign, all residences currently under
quarantine will be receiving a letter thanking them for their continued
cooperation and reminding them to continue meeting all quarantine
obligations until their premises are officially released.
Task force personnel at the Inland Desert ICP are distributing END
educational materials in the utility bills of residents who live in areas
highly affected by the virus. On a daily basis, task force personnel are
communicating information concerning surveillance, depopulation, and
cleaning and disinfection operations to all affected city managers in
Southern California.
Currently, task force information personnel field about 450 calls per week
from the public through the Joint Information Center phone bank. This is a
20-fold increase from the number of calls in October 2002. On average,
about 300 of these calls require follow-up action by the Inland Desert or
South Coast Incident Command Posts. The task force information staff
provides daily updates to about 50 media outlets in California. In
addition, in Area Command alone, the information staff field about 70 media
calls per week.
