A new strain of stomach bug was the virus responsible for almost 700 recent illnesses on a Caribbean cruise ship. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] on Thursday [6 Feb 2014] said the new Sydney strain of norovirus was the cause of the illnesses on board Royal Caribbean's "Explorer of the Seas."

The ship, carrying 3050 passengers, docked in New Jersey last week after 630 passengers and 54 crew members grew ill during a Caribbean cruise. It was one of the largest norovirus outbreaks on a cruise ship in the last 20 years.

The Sydney strain emerged within about the last 2 years. It's not considered unusually dangerous, but has quickly become a common cause of cases of vomiting and diarrhea that last a few days.

[It is likely that the strain of norovirus responsible for the outbreaks in cruise ships this year (2014) in the Caribbean is the GII variant which has appeared recently. A scientific paper published in Eurosurveillance in January 2013 described a new variant of norovirus (genotype G11-4) called Sydney 2012 [see: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20345 or ProMED-mail. Norovirus - emergence of novel genotype II.4 variant 20130103.1480475]. Latest testing of the most recent outbreaks has shown that Sydney 2012 has overtaken all other strains to become the dominant strain. Sydney 2012 was 1st seen in Australia (and takes its name from the place where it was 1st identified) and was also recorded in France, New Zealand and Japan. This new strain does not cause more serious illness than others, and the methods of managing cases and outbreaks are the same as for any strain of norovirus. These measures include washing the hands thoroughly and regularly, particularly after using the toilet and before eating. It is likely that the norovirus responsible for the outbreaks occurring in Carribbean cruise ships is a derivative of this virus.

Noroviruses mutate rapidly, and new strains are constantly emerging. At the start of the season, it is normal for outbreaks to be caused by a range of different strains. However, as the season progresses, particular strains are more successful and become dominant. The emergence of a new strain does not mean that it causes more serious illness, and managing outbreaks and those with the illness remain the same. There is no specific treatment for norovirus infection other than to let the illness take its course, with symptoms usually lasting around 2 days. Keeping hydrated is very important, and you can take over-the-counter medicines to relieve headaches and aches and pains. - Mod.CP
