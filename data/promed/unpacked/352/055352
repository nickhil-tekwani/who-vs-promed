For some vaccine developers, the coronavirus pandemic has had a silver lining in billions of dollars in profits. But a new vaccine rolling out soon in India is taking the opposite approach: Its developers are getting zilch. "We're not trying to make money," said Peter Hotez of the Texas Children's Hospital's Center for Vaccine Development. "We just want to see people get vaccinated."

On Tuesday [28 Dec 2021], the Indian government granted emergency approval to a vaccine manufactured by the Hyderabad-based company Biological E. This "2nd generation" coronavirus vaccine was developed by Hotez and his longtime collaborator Maria Elena Bottazzi. It was then licensed to Biological E. through a commercialization team at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, where both developers also work.

Biological E. has ambitious plans to produce more than one billion doses of the vaccine in 2022. Hotez and Bottazzi won't personally get a penny from it, but their employer Baylor College will get a fee.

Unlike the vaccines of big-name manufacturers such as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, the Texas Children's Hospital vaccine, which is called Corbevax, is being shared patent-free. The Texas Children's Hospital team is also working with manufacturers like Biological E. to ensure they have the know-how to make doses.

The ambition is to create a low-cost, open-source alternative to expensive and limited-supply mRNA vaccines for developing and under-vaccinated countries. And it won't stop at India: Hotez and Bottazzi are talking to other manufacturers around the world and have consulted with the World Health Organization to see how they can share the vaccine globally.

If everything goes to plan, manufacturers all around the world could produce their own versions of the Texas Children's Hospital vaccine, which uses older recombinant protein technology that many manufacturers already have experience with, rather than newer and potentially more complicated technology. Some advocates hope it could be a model for how vaccines should be developed and shared globally during a pandemic.

"Texas Children's Hospital's commitment to sharing technology is a challenge to the pharma giants and the false narrative that vaccine production and medical innovation thrive through secrecy and exclusivity," said Peter Maybarduk, director of the advocacy group Public Citizen. "If Texas Children's Hospital can do it, why can't Pfizer and Moderna?"

Hotez and Bottazzi developed their vaccine with minimal help from the US government, even though Operation Warp Speed invested USD 4.1 billion in Moderna alone. Instead, the Texas Children's Hospital vaccine was developed with USD 7 million from mostly private investors. One of the big early investors was Austin-based Tito's Vodka, which donated USD 1 million in May 2020.

"If we had even a fraction of the support that Moderna had, who knows, maybe the world would be vaccinated by now. We wouldn't be having a discussion about omicron," Hotez said.

How much impact the vaccine will have is not yet clear. Scaling up production for any vaccine, even one that uses older technology, can be difficult. The very limited clinical data about the effectiveness of the Texas Children's Hospital vaccine -- there is a complete lack of data for the omicron variant -- has led some vaccine experts to take a skeptical view of the project.

Biological E. has said it has completed 2 Phase 3 clinical trials involving more than 3000 people across India, with one finding that Corbevax is more than 80% effective against symptomatic disease, but the company has not publicly released the underlying data.

Joseph Osmundson, a virologist at New York University, criticized the high hopes for Corbevax, given the lack of public data from Phase 3 clinical trials. "It's health care for lower- and middle-income countries that we would never accept here," Osmundson said.

James Krellenstein, co-founder of the health-equity organization PrEP4All, noted that unlike Texas Children's Hospital, Biological E. has a financial interest in the vaccine. "Maybe this vaccine will be great. Maybe it won't," he said. "But science, especially when it involves public health, is based on objective analysis of open data, not trusting the word of a vaccine manufacturer with a vested interest in the underlying product."

Hotez said he understood the criticism about the lack of public clinical data but said that Biological E. did not have the scale that other vaccine manufacturers have. "They've assured us they're working on getting that out as fast as possible. Remember, it's a smaller company. They're not one of the big multinationals," he said.

Biological E. has 150 million doses ready to go, according to Hotez, and the Indian government has placed a large preorder of 300 million doses. The aim is to quickly scale up to manufacturing over 100 million doses a month -- a potentially significant amount even in India, where only 40% of the country's 1.38 billion people are reported to be fully vaccinated.

While a company representative declined to discuss the price per dose, Indian media has reported that it may be as low as USD 2.50 -- which would make Corbevax not only the cheapest coronavirus vaccine in India but one of the cheapest in the world. Doses from Pfizer and Moderna sometimes cost almost 10 times that amount, according to publicly available contracts.

Hotez and Bottazzi hope that India is just the start. There are advanced talks to manufacture versions of the Texas Children's Hospital vaccine in Indonesia, Bangladesh and Botswana. And while other vaccine developers have fiercely guarded their intellectual property during the pandemic, Hotez and Bottazzi are in talks to share the license for the vaccine with the WHO's COVID-19 technology access pool.

James Love, director of the advocacy group Knowledge Ecology International, said he was hopeful Corbevax would work both as an initial immunization and a booster. Love, who has consulted with Hotez and Bottazzi on how to share their vaccine globally, noted that because it relies on familiar technology, it may appeal to those concerned about the novelty of mRNA vaccines.

A "simple back-of-the-envelope calculation" showed the need for more inexpensive vaccine doses, Hotez said. In terms of unvaccinated people, he continued, "you've got a billion people in sub-Saharan Africa, almost a billion in Latin America and the Caribbean, another billion in the smaller, low-income countries of Southeast Asia. That's 3 billion people."

"You're going to need 6-9 billion doses of vaccine. So, you know, when the president stands up a couple of weeks ago and says the US government is the largest donor of vaccines, 275 million doses," Hotez said, "I'm looking at that and saying: That's not something to boast about."

[2] Omicron symptoms
Date: Tue 4 Jan 2022 14:13 EST
Source: NBC New York [edited]
https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/omicron-variant-symptoms-latest-covid-making-people-really-sick-in-a-different-way/3477882/


As COVID-19 infections with the omicron variant of the virus surge out of control nationwide, emergency rooms are filling up again -- and one well-known New York City doctor says what they're seeing now is much different than the last 2 years of the pandemic.

Manhattan emergency room physician Dr. Craig Spencer took to Twitter late Monday [3 Jan 2022] night to explain how the current surge is different -- both in who's coming to the ER [emergency room] and how they're being affected by the highly contagious virus. "Today it seemed like everyone had COVID. Like, so many. And yes, like before, there were some really short of breath and needing oxygen. But for most, COVID seemed to topple a delicate balance of an underlying illness. It's making people really sick in a different way," Spencer wrote.

Spencer cited a few examples -- diabetic [patient] being tipped into ketoacidosis, the elderly who were so weak from being ill that they couldn't get out of bed, and etc. "What's also different now is those COVID cases are often in beds next to patients who've done everything to avoid the virus, and for whom an infection might have a dramatic toll. The cancer patient on chemotherapy. Those immunocompromised or severely sick with something else," Spencer said.

He acknowledged, as studies around the world have concluded, that the omicron variant seems to cause milder disease than the delta variant that tore through the country last summer [2021]. But at the same time, with so many more people infected, for hospital purposes it ends up not really mattering. "But there's just SO much of it and it's impacting patients in different ways. So even if just a tiny portion of cases need to stay in the hospital, it can turn into a huge influx," Spencer tweeted.

Spencer, a Manhattan ER doctor affiliated with Columbia University who became a Twitter superstar in the early days of the pandemic for his running commentary on the battle against the virus, recently shared a detailed breakdown of what the omicron cases he and his colleagues have encountered look like so far. "Every patient I've seen with COVID that's had a 3rd 'booster' dose has had mild symptoms. By mild I mean mostly sore throat. Lots of sore throat. Also some fatigue, maybe some muscle pain. No difficulty breathing. No shortness of breath. All a little uncomfortable, but fine," Spencer wrote.

From there, it goes downhill, depending on your vaccination status or lack thereof. But Spencer's comment about sore throats gets to a recent debate about COVID testing and whether the omicron variant is more common in some parts of the body than previous strains of the virus. The #SwabYourThroat trend on Twitter grew out of a series of anecdotal reports from symptomatic people who tested negative on rapid antigen tests with nasal swabs, repeated the test with a throat swab and came back positive immediately. The trend picked up steam with a 27 Dec 2021 tweet from a biologist at University College London, who said she'd tested negative repeatedly until swabbing her throat.

For now, neither the FDA nor other public health authorities have changed any instructions or recommendations on how to use at-home COVID tests, which primarily rely on nasal swabs instead -- even though in the UK, authorities have been offering instructions on how to take at-home throat swabs since early 2020.

[If in fact it holds up that a throat swab is a better diagnostic sample for omicron and nasal swab for delta, it might be best to have a test that combines the 2 samples as long as both variants are circulating. However, Helen Branswell tweets a "report from @CDCgov suggests #omicron is rapidly crowding out the delta variant in the US. This is modeling, so it comes with caveats -- but fewer than earlier Nowcast estimates" (https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell).

As for symptoms, there are reports of a hoarse and husky voice change early with omicron, and little evidence for loss of smell and taste, as occurred with earlier variants. - Mod.LK]

[3] France: new variant B.1.640.2
Date: Tue 4 Jan 2022 15:57 EST
Source: Voice of America [edited]
https://www.voanews.com/a/french-scientists-discover-new-coronavirus-variant-researchers-say-omicron-easily-avoids-immune-system/6381096.html


As the world continues to struggle with the rapid spread of the omicron variant of the coronavirus and the still-lingering delta variant, scientists in France say they have discovered a new variant that contains multiple mutations. Experts at the IHU Mediterranee Infection in Marseille said they had discovered the new variant in December [2021] in 12 patients living near Marseille, with the 1st patient testing positive after traveling to the central African nation of Cameroon.

The French scientists said they had identified 46 mutations in the new variant, dubbed B.1.640.2, that could make it more resistant to vaccines and more infectious than the original virus. The results were posted on the online health sciences outlet MedRxiv, which publishes studies that have not been peer-reviewed or published in an academic journal (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.24.21268174). B.1.640.2 has neither been detected in other countries nor been labeled a "variant of concern" by the World Health Organization.

Meanwhile, a new study out of Denmark reveals omicron is better at avoiding the human immune system, even in people vaccinated against COVID-19. In a study of 12 000 households, researchers at the University of Copenhagen discovered that omicron was between 2.7 and 3.7 times more infectious than delta among vaccinated Danes.

The study, which has not been peer-reviewed, also found that unvaccinated individuals are more likely to transmit the coronavirus than those who have been fully vaccinated and received a booster shot. Against omicron, vaccine effectiveness was reduced to about 40% against symptoms and to 80% against severe disease, and booster shots improved those numbers to 86% against symptoms and 98% against severe disease. "Our findings confirm that the rapid spread of the omicron variant primarily can be ascribed to the immune evasiveness rather than an inherent increase in the basic transmissibility," the researchers wrote.

The omicron outbreak continues to wreak havoc on cities and countries around the world, pushing enormous strains on healthcare systems. In the United States, omicron represented 95.4% of the coronavirus strains in the country as of Saturday [1 Jan 2022], according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Omicron surpassed delta as the dominant strain since its initial detection in the United States on 1 Dec 2021, pushing daily infections past the one million mark on Monday [3 Jan 2022], according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. The numbers are nearly double that of the previous record of about 590 000 set just last week, driven mostly by the omicron variant. The CDC said omicron accounted for about 77% of cases in the United States in the week ending 25 Dec 2021, a percentage sharply higher than its 58.6% projection announced the previous week.

Authorities in Australia's most populous state of New South Wales reported more than 23 000 new COVID-19 infections on Tuesday [4 Jan 2022], breaking the previous record of 22 577 new cases set on New Year's Day [2022], and 1344 hospitalizations, surpassing the record of 1268 hospitalizations back in September [2021], at the height of the delta outbreak. Neighboring Victoria state posted 14 020 new cases Tuesday, breaking Monday's record of 8577 new cases.

The states of Queensland and South Australia and the island of Tasmania also reported record numbers of new infections Tuesday [4 Jan 2022], pushing Australia's total number of COVID-19 infections past the 500 000 milestone. The surge has led to a critical shortage of staff members at hospitals across Australia, with healthcare workers furloughed after contracting the virus. Testing centers have also been forced to shut down either because of staffing shortages or testing backlogs. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison has rejected calls for the federal government in Canberra to provide free rapid antigen tests to all Australians.

Another Chinese city has entered into a full lockdown after 3 people tested positive for COVID-19 in recent days. Authorities have ordered all 1.2 million residents of the central city of Yuzhou to remain in their homes and have closed nearly all public facilities, including schools, transportation and shopping malls.

The strict lockdown measures in Yuzhou are similar to those imposed in the northwestern city of Xi'an, where 13 million residents have been confined to their homes since 23 Dec 2021 because of an outbreak of the delta variant that has sickened more than 1600 residents. The lockdowns are part of Beijing's "zero-COVID" strategy that includes mass testing, lengthy quarantine periods and snap lockdowns.

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced Tuesday [4 Jan 2022] that the semi-autonomous city is extending its vaccine requirements for public venues. Lam said that all Hong Kongers will have to show proof of vaccination to enter museums, public libraries and schools, effective 24 Feb 2022. The expanded vaccination mandate, which already covers entertainment venues, was imposed in the wake of Hong Kong confirming its 1st omicron infection cluster.

[4] Opinion: lockdowns
Date: Mon 3 Jan 2022
Source: Washington Post [edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/01/03/omicron-lockdowns-covid-2022/


We are entering the 3rd year of the pandemic with a confusing state of affairs. The United States has far surpassed the number of daily COVID-19 infections compared with the previous peak last winter [2021], yet many businesses remain open, stadiums are packed and children are headed back to school. News headlines announce that "omicron infections seem to be milder" than earlier variants, yet this could be the "worst public health challenge of our lifetimes."

Here's how to reconcile the seeming contradictions of where we are: The risk to individuals is low, while the risk to society is high. Policy solutions that demand substantial individual sacrifice will not work; instead, we need to acknowledge the public's very real weariness and come up with practical strategies that keep society functioning.

Research is increasingly pointing to omicron causing less severe disease compared with previous variants. In addition, vaccination -- especially with a booster -- appears highly protective against hospitalization and death. The tsunami of viral transmission means that many vaccinated people will have breakthrough infections, but the vast majority will have symptoms somewhere between a mild cold and the flu.

As a result, it's unreasonable to ask vaccinated people to refrain from pre-pandemic activities. After all, the individual risk to them is low, and there is a steep price to keeping students out of school, shuttering restaurants and retail shops, and stopping travel and commerce.

At the same time, out of control virus dynamics pose existential threats to society. So many firefighters and emergency medical personnel are out because of COVID-19 that Cincinnati declared a state of emergency. One in 6 police officers in New York City had symptoms or were diagnosed with COVID-19 last week. Thousands of flights have been canceled, in part because of inadequate staffing from quarantined workers.

The situation facing hospitals is particularly dire. At least 6 Maryland hospitals have shifted to crisis standards of care, citing depletion of existing resources. New York state has asked 32 hospitals to postpone nonurgent elective scheduled surgeries. Leaders from 9 Minnesota hospitals took out an ad that began, "We're heartbroken. We're overwhelmed."

The United States has 3 options for dealing with this surge. First, we could reimpose lockdowns. While some European and Asian countries have chosen this path, I believe it's a nonstarter here. Even if lockdowns could more quickly bring omicron under control, there is no political appetite or public backing for this level of collective sacrifice.

Second, we could let omicron run its course. There's a school of thought that omicron is so contagious it will infect nearly everyone anyway, and it's better to get this variant and develop additional immunity. Instead of trying to stop it, we could treat omicron as we do a common cold: We don't isolate people with colds, and getting rid of isolation and quarantine would alleviate staffing shortages and keep the economy going. However, this path of uncontrolled spread would almost assuredly push many hospitals over the edge, and patients could die because they can't access timely care.

There is a 3rd path that aims to save our hospitals while also minimizing disruption. We don't need to ask people to stay home, but we should require that they wear high-quality masks in all indoor public spaces. We don't need to cancel gatherings, but we should mandate proof of vaccination -- and boosters -- for all indoor dining, gyms, movie theaters, and sporting events.

Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that it is shortening the isolation period for those infected with COVID-19 from 10 days to 5. It can go even further -- not to get rid of isolation requirements for everyone but to reduce or even forgo isolation and quarantine (while mandating high-quality masks) for those working in public safety, transportation, education and other critical jobs.

In the meantime, we must do much more to protect the most vulnerable, including ensuring boosters for all nursing home residents and staff, ramping up production of preventive monoclonal antibodies for the immunocompromised and expediting vaccine approval for children under 5.

The Biden administration should be up front and say that it is taking these actions out of necessity. These are not the scientifically most sound or the most efficient ways to curb COVID-19, but they are the practical middle path that balances what Americans can tolerate with what we need to do to avert the collapse of our healthcare system.

This is our new reality going forward. There could well be surges of new variants every year -- or even every few months. As long as vaccines continue to protect against severe illness and the risk to most individuals remains low, our paradigm has to shift from preventing infection to stopping societal devastation.

[I agree with Leana Wen's opinion piece supporting a policy that would "mandate proof of vaccination -- and boosters -- for all indoor dining, gyms, movie theaters, and sporting events" rather than lockdowns. But I would carry it even further to include all mass gatherings taking place indoors during times of peak transmission. In addition, there is no mention of rapid tests. If individuals were required to present a negative test result taken within 24 hours of an event, that would likely prevent inadvertent community transmission from occurring, which could happen even among vaccinated/boosted individuals who have become infectious as a result of breakthrough of omicron. This, of course, would require a large investment by the government in production and distribution of rapid tests. These tests should be free or subsidized, as should N95 masks during times of peak activity. Thus, the events that call for testing need to be determined. In the long run, such measures would be less expensive than lockdowns. - Mod.LK]

A global total of 7691 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 2 Jan 2022 to late 3 Jan 2022).

The exponential rise in cases over the last couple of weeks can be attributed to the rapid increase in the omicron variant cases in over 90 countries. Studies suggest that omicron variant causes milder disease than the previously dominant delta variant, but the high number of cases caused by this highly infectious/transmissible variant could rapidly overwhelm hospitals and health systems.

The major differences seen due to daily fluctuations in testing rates can be misleading, and therefore the rolling 7-day average is a more precise indicator to follow the trends of the pandemic, which indicate an increasing global trend on cases with some reduction in deaths.

A total of 72 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 42 of the 72 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, 5 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South-East Asia region, and 9 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 86.0%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 7.5%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 105.4% increase in daily reported cases and a 16.9% decrease in reported deaths.
