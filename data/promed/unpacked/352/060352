BSE AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CONUNDRUM
================================
[- On Sunday 2 June I sent Ralph Blanchfield the following set
of questions. MHJ]

Ralph,
May I pose you a question?
While the probable causes of the BSE epizootic in the UK are
now fairly well known and generally widely accepted, with all
the caveats fully implied with this difficult disease, why have
there been so few cases in Western Europe?
I don't wish to get into a discussion of how many cases non-UK
Europe has had above and beyond the "Official Reports". In my mind
I expect that there have been a few thousand, somewhere between
200+ and below say 3,000. And certainly a very small number
compared to the UK.
My query is not so much related to the "non-appearance" of cases
related to UK cattle feed, which Switzerland seems to have been
almost uniquely sensitive to, nor to the sideways feeding of
UK pig feed to cattle on the same farm, as presumeably happened
in Europe as in the UK, but more to (1) the handling of local downer
stock, (2) the changes in rendering practices (presumeably the same
changes occurred on the Continent at about the same time as in the UK),
and (3) the background ultra-low prevalence of sporadic BSE (if
Roger Eddy and others are correct) which would have gone to the
renders. And (4) even if sporadic BSE cases were not being fed
into the Continental rendering cycle, one must presume that
unrecognised epidemic cases were, at least for a few years in the
mid to late 80s/early 90s.
Is anyone doing quantitative research into the non-appearance?
I am sure that there have been subjective studies. With Western Europe
as large and varied as it is, a simple answer that the farmers use
soya beans doesn't quite provide any hard answers as MBM must be
being fed in a number of areas and in amounts from a few grams per day
per head up to more signficant amounts, over a ?threshold infective
volume.
To take the question further, if modelling studies indicate that such
an epidemic were starting, why did it apparently abort?
[Answers to this must accept that while diseases may, infections know
no boundaries. Governments are rarely that prescient with new regulations.]

Hello Martin,
As regards handling of local downer stock, I have no knowledge, but
there is a useful article about UK knackers and handling of local
downer stock in the Economist of 6 April.
As I said in my "holding" message yesterday, John Wilesmith's
"detective work" produced an answer by May 1988, incriminating meat
and bonemeal in compounded cattle feed,The consequent course of
action, after a time lag attributable mainly to the incubation period
but also to some of the factors that you mention, appears to be
resulting in dramatic reductions in new cases (first sixteen weeks of
1996 averaging 82 per week, less than one-eighth of the 1992-93 peak
rate). But unlike the detective novel, where the detective ties up all
the loose ends in the last chapter, here there is a rationale that has
been accepted, in which there are many loose ends, not to mention
some mythology and incorrect history of changes in rendering.
A typical, and authoritative, outline of the cause and the rationale
was given by Ray Bradley in a seminar lecture on 29 February, of which
the following extracts are relevant --
"So let's look at how this epidemic started. First of all, in
scientific terms this is an extended common source epidemic. That
means that every single cow has been exposed to infection from a
common source (feed). At the end of 1987, John Wilesmith, of the
Central Veterinary Laboratory, who has kindly provided much of this
data for me, looked at the first 200 cases of BSE and did a very
careful analysis of the epidemiology He found the only common feature
was that every single case had been fed proprietary concentrates or
protein supplements and he identified that the vehicle that carried
the infection was the meat and bone meal."
"The precipitating factor causing BSE was a sudden cessation of
hydrocarbon solvent extraction of tallow in the rendering system. That
again is another story and I am sure you are probably familiar with
it. Why did this occur? Well, this process probably inactivated the
causal agent sufficiently to prevent disease and when that procedure
was stopped independently by the rendering companies for commercial
reasons, this permitted sufficient infectivity to pass into the feed
and cause disease. It was then recycled and initiated the escalation
in the epidemic from mid 1989 onwards. How had solvent extraction of
tallow prevented the disease? We think by the double heat process
which this particular kind of rendering utilised and in particular the
use of a second wet heat stage using steam in a low fat environment.
When did that happen? It happened in the late l 970s and early 1980s
especially in the period 1981/82 when cattle were first exposed to
sufficient agent to cause disease which was first recognised five
years or so later after the incubation period was complete."
To this explanation of the rationale is often attached a frequently
repeated myth that this was the result of removal of previous
regulations requiring such treatments. I have been unable to trace any
such regulations or any regulations revoking them. On this point and
some of the later points, a little background may be helpful.
There are (or were) two separate industries involved in the
production of animal feedstuffs based on meat and bonemeal. They are
the rendering industry, making and milling the meat and bonemeal, and
the feed compounding industry. The renderers do not normally sell
their product direct to farmers but to the compounders

The information that follows derives from discussions with a
now-retired well-known technologist who worked for one of the major
rendering companies during the period in question.
After the first heated stage of rendering, much of the fat (tallow)
was removed by pressing, leaving behind the "greaves" containing
residual fat. Why was solvent extraction ever involved? It was because
it was virtually impossible, in the small-scale batch processing
plants that existed up to the early 1960s, to mill the meat and
bonemeal without first removing the residual fat, by solvent
extraction. Up to the early 1960s, the renderers therefore carried out
solvent extraction, and sold the milled product to compounders on a
commercial specification of 50% protein, and very low fat content.
After extraction the residual solvent then was removed from the
product by "stripping" it with steam nominally at 120 deg C plus,
(though, delving further into detailed history, I am told by my
informant, that it was, in practice, not always operated above 100
deg C). The fat-in-solvent solution was then evaporated to leave the
by-product, tallow.
By the early 1960s, there was a worldwide trend to move from a larger
number of renderers operating small-scale batch processing to fewer
large-scale continuous processing plants of modern design, on which,
moreover, it was possible to mill the product containing the residual
fat, so that there was no technical need for solvent extraction or for
the subsequent steam stripping of solvent residues. These changes were
taking place worldwide, not just in the UK.
Meanwhile, tallow was increasingly being added as an ingredient during
compounding, as an energy supplement,. Realisation dawned
that it was ridiculous to go to all the trouble, expense, hazard and
environmental pollution involved in removing residual tallow by
solvent extraction, only for it to be added back in compounding. This
led to the increasing adoption of a commercial specification of a 45%
protein meal with 8-10% fat, which could, of course, be achieved, and
milled, without solvent extraction. The trend started with the
largest renderers back in the early 1960s, not "in the late l 970s and
early 1980s especially in the period 1981/82" as the typical
rationale has it. Moreover, the major UK renderers doing this were
not only doing it in the UK but in their factories in continental
Europe (plus of course there was a substantial export trade from the
UK)
I have heard that two small renderers in Scotland carried on solvent
extracting after everyone else had stopped, but that is hearsay..
In any event, research in the last few years on the conditions
necessary to inactivate BSE infectivity demonstrates that the
steam-stripping process would be most unlikely to have inactivated it.
The economic benefit of removing the two unnecessary processes, is
interlinked with the changes in technology that made it possible, in
operating scale and in concentration of the industry into fewer larger
units. The economics were obviously significant in the 1970s after
the oil crisis of 1973 onwards (more from energy usage than from
solvent, which was recovered); and the safety aspect even more
significant in the UK in view of the general tightening up on
industrial safety after the Flixborough disaster in June 1974.
So it would seem that the changes in processing started much earlier
than is generally supposed, and were not confined to the UK.
Regarding the background of ultra-low prevalence of sporadic BSE, This
seems possible. Some experts still have reservations about sheep meat
and bonemeal as the sole source, particularly with regard to how the
sheep scrapie prion changed, during passage through cattle, to the BSE
prion. Some of those offer the view that BSE has always existed at low
and previously unrecognised level in cattle, and the inclusion of
cattle meat in the animal feed resulted in an amplification effect.
Some older farmers and vets now say, with hindsight, that it has
always existed, but occurred so rarely that when a cow had "the
staggers" nobody recognised it as anything but an inexplicable one-off
event.
If there are any studies attempting to tie up these loose ends,
particularly as to the contrast between the UK and continental
European outcomes, I am not personally aware of them.
I am not sure that all this helps you; on the contrary, it is probably
making the whole picture look even more untidy.

Ralph

[- As Ralph states, the whole European picture becomes untidy as it is
clear that the reasons for BSE not becoming epidemic have yet to be
defined and quantified. Can anyone provide any clarification? MHJ]
