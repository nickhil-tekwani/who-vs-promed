CDC is collaborating with public health officials in several states and the FDA to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Stanley infections. Results from this ongoing investigation indicate that raw cashew cheese produced by The Cultured Kitchen of West Sacramento, California is the likely source of this outbreak.

Public health investigators are using DNA "fingerprints" of bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. They are using data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network made up of state and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections. This strain of _Salmonella_ Stanley is rare in the PulseNet database and has been seen only 20 times prior to this outbreak.

A total of 14 ill persons infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Stanley have been reported from 3 states. Most of the ill people have been reported from California (85 percent). The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: California (12), Nevada (1), and Wyoming (1); 1 ill person identified in Utah likely acquired their infection during international travel and was excluded from the case count.

Among persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 13 Nov 2013 to 9 Dec 2013. Ill persons range in age from 2 years to 77 years, with a median age of 27 years; 50 percent of ill persons are female. Among 12 ill persons with available information, 3 (25 percent) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the Outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic and traceback investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies indicate that consumption of raw cashew cheese produced by The Cultured Kitchen is the likely source of this outbreak of _S._ Stanley infections. Cashew cheese is a non-dairy product made from raw cashews and other ingredients.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about foods consumed and other exposures during the week before becoming ill; 7 (64 percent) of 11 ill persons interviewed reported eating raw cashew cheese in the week before becoming ill. Among those who had brand information available, 6 (86 percent) of these 7 ill persons reported that they had eaten The Cultured Kitchen brand raw cashew cheese or had purchased it at a retail location that sold this brand.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods eaten before becoming ill. FDA is continuing to work closely with CDC and state partners in this investigation.

[It is apparent from the report that the cashew cheese is not a dairy product, but rather a spread made from cashew nut, perhaps better called a cashew butter (another misnomer) akin to peanut butter. Since 2007, there have been 3 outbreaks of salmonellosis linked to peanut butter, related to serotypes Tennessee, Typhimurium and Bredeney. - Mod.LL
