Several hundred cattle died of anthrax, and another several hundred were infected with the disease in Meherpur, according to the Department of Livestock.

Livestock department officials said they had already taken preventive measures to contain the disease so that it could not spread to other districts.

The department director general, Hiresh Ranjan Bhowmik, told New Age on Friday [20 Sep 2019] that they were aware of sporadic infections of anthrax at Gangni in Meherpur. He said a team of experts comprising veterinary specialists from the livestock department had already been sent to Meherpur to examine the ground situation. Besides, the team would bring samples for further examination in Dhaka, he said, adding that the farmers were advised to vaccinate their cattle against anthrax.

Hiresh also said a few goats died of anthrax, as the farmers did not vaccinate them earlier.

"There are enough vaccines ready to provide," he said, adding that anthrax vaccines were provided to farmers at a nominal price of Tk 0.50 [USD less than a penny] each. He said due to lack of awareness, the cattle farmers were not interested in vaccinating their cattle against the disease.

Officials said that anthrax, an infection by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_, was usually transmitted from animals to animals and animals to humans. The deadly disease could affect human health and causes disorders of skin, lung, and bowel, they said.

In 2010, cattle were affected in epidemic form in the country's northern districts, said the department officials, adding that a red alert was declared in 12 districts including Sirajganj and Pubna. Animal health experts said that Indian cattle were entering into Bangladesh through informal channels for sale in local markets ahead of Eid-ul-Azha without check, posing a threat to both public and animal health. They said that even after establishing quarantine stations at the entry points, Bangladesh could not become a risk-free country until illegal entry of cattle from India was stopped.

[The only report we have of anthrax in Meherpur is for 2013 and involved 5 human cutaneous cases [14 Aug 2013; Anthrax - Bangladesh (04): (ME) human 20130814.1879141]. This totaled 87 cases in that district up to that date. None have been reported since, apparently, until this extensive bovine epidemic.

To find Meherpur go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meherpur_District. It is a small district of only 716 sq km in the middle of the western border with India, next to West Bengal. The extent of cattle cases indicates that livestock vaccination was inactive.

Reading between the lines, this is a very preliminary report, and the actual number of cases is uncertain, though probably significant. As anthrax is not contagious but can be spread by biting tabanid flies, when large numbers of cattle can be affected, I think we can assume, for the moment, that this is a haemophagic-fly epidemic. The note that goats were largely spared is typical of fly cases, as the tabanid flies have difficulty seeing goats, as their vision is based on black-body attraction. Meherpur, being on the border adjoining West Bengal with minimal livestock movement controls, will just add to their problems and risks. - Mod.MHJ
