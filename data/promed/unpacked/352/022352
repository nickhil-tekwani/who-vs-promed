The Egyptian Minister of Health and Population, Dr. Adel Adawi, announced a human case of H5N1 avian influenza (AI) in a 3-month-old girl from the Giza governorate. According to the Minister, the date of onset of the illness was Monday, 22 Sep 2014; she was presenting symptoms of fever, sore throat, cough and vomiting.

The girl's parents took her to the Hospital of the Abbasid, and she was released 3 days later. They said the child had exposure to dead birds. A throat sample was taken and analyzed and confirmed positive for avian influenza virus (A/H5N1). The child was treated with Tamiflu and is reportedly in stable condition.

According to the Health Ministry, this is the 4th human H5N1 AI case of 2014. However, the people at FluTrackers point out that this is the 5th case of the bird flu, writing on their site: "We have a record of 4 previous cases. 3 were announced by the Ministry of Health of Egypt, and one was announced by the Ministry of Health of Beheira governorate:

No. 14 Egypt - Female, 56, hospitalized in critical condition,
No. 15 Egypt - Child, 4, mild condition,
No. 16 Egypt - Female, 86, hospitalized in serious condition and
No. 19 Egypt - Male, 34, hospitalized on ventilator, Death."

[Avian influenza or "bird flu" is an infectious disease of animals (usually birds, and less commonly pigs) caused by type A strains of the influenza virus. Transmission to humans is rare, but there is recent cause for concern. In mid-2003, the largest and most severe avian flu outbreak in history began in South-east Asia, caused by a sub-type of the virus called H5N1 and resulting in widespread transmission to poultry and some documented transmission to humans. Transmission of H5N1 to humans is of particular concern because it mutates rapidly and may therefore change into a form that is highly infectious for humans and more easily spread. In addition, unlike normal seasonal influenza, H5N1 can cause severe disease in humans.

The cumulative number of confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) reported to WHO, 2003-2014, can be found at http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20140124CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf?ua=1. - Mod.CP
