A child who exhibited pigs at the Berrien County Fair earlier this month [August 2013] has contracted the same strain of flu diagnosed in a pig from that fair, the 1st case of H3N2 variant identified in Michigan in 2013, health officials confirmed today. It was not the sick child's pig that tested positive for the virus, but another exhibition animal at the same fair, said Bridget Patrick, spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development [MDARD].

As a result of the illnesses, the health and agriculture officials have launched an extensive multi-state outreach to meat processing plants that bought pigs from the Berrien County Fair, to make them aware of the potential exposure to their employees who may have come into contact with the live pigs shipped for slaughter. Meat from the pigs, all healthy at the time of slaughter at the end of the fair, is safe to eat and cannot transmit the disease, said Dr. James Averill, MDARD Animal Industry Division Director and State Veterinarian. State health and agriculture officials are working with the Berrien County Youth Fair board to reach out to swine exhibitors who attended the fair to identify additional illnesses. Patrick said 234 exhibitors showed 300 pigs at that fair.

The incubation period for this influenza, like the usual seasonal influenza, is 1 to 7 days; and most commonly 2 days. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be new cases from direct exposure at the recent Berrien County Youth Fair, which ran from [12-17 Aug 2013], officials said. The MDARD has notified managers at upcoming fairs in Hillsdale, St. Joseph, Allegan, Chippewa, Dickenson and Presque Isle counties, as well as fairs in Saline and Novi, reminding them of swine exhibit hygiene and screening practices designed to prevent the spread of illness. Initial information was circulated earlier this year [2013] after flu outbreaks in neighboring states of Ohio and Indiana, Patrick said.

"Berrien County Youth Fair had hand washing stations, posters, and good biosecurity practices in place, and it's important that all fairs continue these practices." Symptoms of H3N2v infection in people are similar to those of seasonal flu viruses and can include fever and respiratory symptoms, such as cough and runny nose, and possibly other symptoms, such as body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Infections with influenza viruses can sometimes cause severe disease, even in healthy people. This can include complications, such as pneumonia, which may require hospitalization, and sometimes results in death.

"While this variant flu virus has rarely been shown to spread from person to person, we remain on the lookout for such secondary cases. In addition, any individual with flu-like symptoms at this time, prior to the traditional flu season, should contact his or her medical provider and local health department," said Dr. Rick Johansen, Medical Director of the Berrien County Health Department. "While Michigan did see a handful of H3N2v cases in 2012, this 1st case for 2013 should serve as an important reminder of the simple steps that can be taken to protect our health as we would with any flu season," said Dr. Matthew Davis, Chief Medical Executive with the Michigan Department of Community Health.

"Washing your hands, covering your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough, and staying home when you feel sick are some of the best ways to protect yourself and others from becoming ill."

[The distinctive feature of this case is that the pig brought to the fair by the child who contracted influenza was uninfected, and the child's infection originated from another animal being displayed at the fair. - Mod.CP
