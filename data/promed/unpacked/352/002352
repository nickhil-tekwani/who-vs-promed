Vets in southwestern Slovenia have established several cases of
equine infectious anaemia (EIA), an insect-borne viral infection of
horses. Tests have shown 12 horses in the Vipava Valley have been
infected, according to the 24ur web news portal.

[EIA is a retroviral infection of horses that results in acute
symptoms in some animals, and chronic fevers, anemia, edema, and
cachexia in others. All infected horses, including those that are
asymptomatic, become carriers and are infectious for life. Infected
animals must either be destroyed or remain permanently isolated from
other horses to prevent transmission. The virus is transmitted
mechanically on the mouthparts of biting flies in the genus
_Stomoxys_ (horse flies and deer flies). Transmission is more common
in the summer and in humid, swampy regions. EIA can also be spread on
contaminated needles or surgical instruments, and passed from a mare
to her foal in utero. The disease is found worldwide, including the
USA. However, several countries claim freedom of the disease.

The disease does not affect humans.

The Vipava Valley is located in the Slovenian Littoral, between the
towns of Nova Gorica and Vipava, which can be seen on the
HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/r/005X>.

Slovenia reported to the OIE 2 new EIA outbreaks in April 2008,
involving 3 horses from Novo Mesto (southeast Slovenia); no
information on the fate of the said horses was disclosed. These were
the only cases reported to the OIE since 2005.

It will be interesting to note if the currently reported 12 cases
were clinical or rather subclinical, owing their detection to serosurveillance.
