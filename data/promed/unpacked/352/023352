Angola: A Appraisal of Experience Gained in the Control of the
Marburg Fever Outbreak in Uige
------------------------------
In late March 2005, when MSF teams first arrived at the Marburg
outbreak site in Angola, they were forced to take drastic --
seemingly uncaring -- measures to contain one of the most deadly and
contagious viruses known to man. 4 months later, the Marburg epidemic
that has so far killed 350 persons out of 391 cases [89.5 percent
fatality] seems to be grinding to a halt. As only a few new cases
have been confirmed over the past weeks, MSF has ended its emergency
intervention and handed over its activities. But teams are now busy
taking stock of the lessons they learned.

One of the first questions people would ask us was: 'You're MSF,
you're doctors, why don't you treat us? Why don't you have a cure".
"We had to deliver the message that, not only is the disease deadly,
but on top of that, infected persons have to be isolated. That's a
very bitter pill to swallow, and there's no sugar coating for it." It
is a human reaction: every one of us would be overcome with fear and
anger if members of our family were suddenly taken away from their
homes by strangers dressed like astronauts; if they were brought to a
hospital; and if they came out a few days later in body bags, only to
be swiftly deposited 2 meters under the ground without so much as a
burial ceremony.

But aid workers fighting against Marburg -- a highly infectious,
rare, untreatable and deadly hemorrhagic fever resembling Ebola
hemorrhagic fever -- had one clear priority in mind: to contain the
epidemic and save lives by isolating contagious persons and bodies as
fast as possible. The toughest challenge faced by MSF teams in
Angola was how to adopt a sensitive, humane approach to one of the
most cruel viruses on earth. Now that the number of new cases has
dwindled to a near halt, MSF is taking the time to reflect on the
lessons it has learned -- sometimes the hard way -- over the past 4
months. "First we were overwhelmed. The situation we encountered when
we arrived was horrible," said Peter Maes, an MSF water and
sanitation expert who works for MSF's infection control unit. "We had
to chase after corpses decomposing in houses and morgues. There was
no time to talk to the families. No time for mourning. The risk of
contagion from dead bodies is very high, so it was urgent to bury
them."

The backlash was that fear-inspired rumors quickly spread among the
inhabitants of Uige, the town in northern Angola that was the focal
point of the epidemic. Some of the inhabitants said the new
foreigners were "stealing the dead" -- a serious charge given the
local belief that people who are not properly buried will turn into
bad spirits and take revenge on the living. Others claimed that:
"Astronauts" (aid workers in full-body safety suits) were "demons"
who were "confiscating the sick" or even worse, "killers" who had
"come to exterminate us" by spreading the Marburg virus. "It was
obvious that we had to change our approach," said Maes. "And we did
this as soon as we could."

He explained how, in early April, a couple of weeks after the
epidemic was officially confirmed, MSF began "humanizing" the
burials, notably by allowing family members to attend and
participate: Family members standing at a safe distance could see the
face of the deceased when the body bag was briefly unzipped open, and
those given protective gear could help carry and lower the coffin,"
he said.

To support MSF's medical teams, new reinforcements arrived, including
staff members like Patrick Depienne, a sociologist who was given the
task of informing and sensitizing the local population, explaining;
how the virus is transmitted; what MSF is doing; why certain
traditions such as washing the bodies of the deceased are extremely
risky; and why isolating cases is crucial. "Sensitizing the
population is a priority," said Depienne, who worked 6 weeks in the
province of Uige. "But of course it takes time and resources, and
usually the first people to get to the scene of a disaster focus on
the medical action." Patrick's number-one wish? "To arrive earlier.
I wish I had gotten a seat in that 1st plane of aid workers that flew
to Angola."

"Many aspects need to come together to control an epidemic like
Marburg," said Dr. Armand Sprecher, a public health specialist who
worked as a medical coordinator for MSF at the beginning of the
Marburg epidemic. "If you want to have an impact, you need good
epidemiological surveillance, good contact tracing, good case
management, good logistics, good communication, etc., and the failure
of one thing brings the whole house of cards down. But I think that
one of the most crucial, yet most neglected, elements is
communication and sensitization. If you don't do that right,
everything else falls apart, because Marburg is transmitted and
amplified by certain human behaviours."

The problem is that the list of risky behaviours is long, as the
virus is transmitted by contact with infected and symptomatic humans
-- specifically, by contact with their body fluids, ranging from
blood and breast milk to spit and sweat. Another problem is that, no
matter how much effort is put into communicating about Marburg, for
many reasons it is difficult to get persons suspected of having the
virus to come to health structures where they can be diagnosed and,
if needed, isolated. The primary reason is that there is no cure for
Marburg. MSF doctors and nurses can only treat the symptoms of the
disease -- such as high fever and dehydration -- and reduce the
suffering of dying patients.

Some Angolan authorities opted for a hard approach. "The government
issued a decree saying that persons who refused to go to the hospital
would be taken there by force," said Dr. Martin De Smet, MSF
Emergency Pool Coordinator. "The problem with this strategy is that
you'll get one person in the hospital, but all the others will run
away. It might work in a small region, where there may be no way to
escape, but Uige is a very vast province."

Another reason the beds in isolation wards can stay empty is that
Marburg is hard to detect. Its symptoms, which include high fever,
diarrhea and vomiting, are non-specific and similar to those of
common, tropical diseases such as malaria. Marburg fever is not as
dramatic and gory as media reports portray it to be. "Patients don't
bleed profusely from every orifice," said Dr. Sprecher who worked in
Gulu, Uganda in 2000 and can compare Marburg fever to Ebola fever.
But still Dr. Sprecher admits: "I think Marburg is even scarier.
Because a person can feel a bit weak and look slightly ill but drop
dead the next day. It makes you think the man sitting next to you in
the bus might be infected."
While most infected persons unknowingly pass on the virus, some of
them -- for example one of the nurses who was working in the
paediatric ward of a provincial hospital an hour's drive from Uige
town -- endanger the lives of others because denial and the fear of
death prevent them from telling what they know or suspect. As Marburg
takes a heavy toll on health care personnel (16 died in Uige
hospital, due to the absence or inefficiency of infection control
measures), the disease can potentially lead to the collapse of a
country's health care system. In addition, the stigma attached to
medical personnel and structures, and the confusion surrounding
symptoms means that many people with treatable diseases will avoid
getting proper care and may end up dying at home. Allowing visitors
to come inside the isolation ward is one way to help de-stigmatize
it. In Uige hospital, MSF was able to enforce the use of safety suits
by the family members of isolated patients and, according to Dr. De
Smet,. "We realized that we could have higher transparency without
compromising bio-security and infection control."

The most effective "Marburg messengers" are patients who have been
inside the isolation ward and come out alive. A 27-year-old taxi
driver named Horacio was the 1st survivor known to MSF and in early
May 2005, a few weeks after he was discharged and had regained his
strength, Horacio was hired by MSF to raise awareness about Marburg
and encourage other Angolans to come to the hospital.

As a last resort when Marburg-infected persons refuse to come is
"home-based risk reduction". "It's a last resort option we can't
afford to exclude and one that we began exploring in Angola,"
explained Dr. Martin Smet. ."We make home visits, spend time with the
family members, tell them not to touch the Marburg victim, and
introduce hygienic measures. But of course we cannot observe if and
how these measures are applied. We gave the head of the household a
safety suit," he said, "and the neighbours, especially all the
children, watched with curiosity as he dressed up outside and turned
into an 'astronaut'. Then the head of the household went into the
house with the MSF disinfection team, and together we made all the
small judgement calls: we looked at all the objects -- the TV, the
embroidered tablecloth, etc. -- and decided what to keep and
disinfect by spraying chlorine and what to burn or throw away in a
special waste pit." Maes added with a smile: "Sometimes people would
get a bit over-enthusiastic about the disinfection process, so we
would do extra spraying, to please them and to reassure them that
their homes were safe again." Ironically, a simple solution of
chlorine and water is enough to destroy a virus that is such a potent
killer once it finds an opportunity to spread. In Uige, this
opportunity was fortunately contained and it seems that Marburg will
soon return to its dormant state. But MSF will continue to closely
monitor outbreaks of hemorrhagic fevers. And if it needs to intervene
again, the organisation knows it can count on volunteers like Peter
Maes, Patrick Depienne, Dr. Armand Sprecher and many others who have
gained rare, 1st-hand experience and are willing to go "back to the
field" as soon as they are called.

[A month ago on Sun 5 Jun 2005, the Ministry of Health in Angola
reported 423 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these cases, 357
were fatal. The vast majority of cases have occurred in Uige
Province, where 412 cases and 346 deaths have been reported. An WHO
Update of 17 Jun 2005 reported that the Ministry of Health in Angola
has reported a total of 422 cases and 356 deaths in Uige Province. 21
contacts are being followed in Uige municipality and 111 in other
municipalities. It is not entirely clear why the number of cases and
deaths reported by MSF as of 7 Jul 2005 is less than those the WHO
and Ministry of Health have reported. It is clear, however, that the
Marburg hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Uige province has almost
certainly now been successfully contained.

The experience of the MSF teams in Angola can serve as a useful
example for other aid agencies facing similar situations where a
heavy-handed approach has been counter-productive.- Mod.CP]
