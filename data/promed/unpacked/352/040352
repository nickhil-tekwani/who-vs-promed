New York-based papaya distributor Agroson's is recalling fruit sold under the Cavi brand because it was grown on a farm that the FDA said was linked to a deadly multistate salmonellosis outbreak. An outbreak of the disease linked to Maradol papayas has killed one person in New York and sickened more than 100 others. The Caribena brand of papayas had previously been recalled due to safety concerns.

"The FDA is now advising that consumers avoid Caribena and Cavi brands of Maradol papayas, and all varieties of papayas from the Carica de Campeche farm located in Campeche, MX, as a result of the FDA's traceback investigation and testing," it said.

"The FDA is working to identify additional brand(s) that these papayas are sold under and facilitate recall(s). Meanwhile, consumers should ask their retailers about the source of their papayas."

Agroson's recalled more than 2400 boxes of Cavi-brand Maradol papayas on Fri 4 Aug 2017 grown and packed by Carica de Campeche. The product in question was distributed to wholesalers in New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey from 16 to 19 Jul 2017, and was available until Mon 31 Jul 2017.

"Other Cavi papayas from other farms are not subject to recall. Consumers who may have these papayas should dispose of them in the trash," the FDA said. It added Agroson's had ceased importing papayas from the grower. "The company is taking precautionary measures to ensure the safety of its imported produce by taking samples of every load to a private lab, and testing for _Salmonella_," the FDA said. "The company is also cooperating with the FDA in their investigation and will provide any assistance possible."

A 3rd produce importer in the USA is recalling whole, fresh maradol papayas grown and packed by Carica de Campeche in Mexico because a deadly, ongoing salmonellosis outbreak has been traced to papayas from the farm. Freshtex Produce LLC of Alamo, TX, posted its recall of "Valery" brand maradol papayas from the farm in Southern Mexico on Mon 7 Aug 2017. Freshtex Produce distributed the recalled papayas to customers in Illinois from 10 through 13 Jul 2017. "However, the product may have been further distributed outside the state of Illinois," according to the recall notice on the Food and Drug Administration's website.

Grande Produce of San Juan, TX, and Agroson's Produce of New York City already recalled whole, fresh maradol papayas from the Carica de Campeche farm in Southern Mexico. Although no illnesses had been confirmed in relation to the Valery brand of maradol papayas as of Mon 7 Aug 2017, there are 109 people across 16 states who have been confirmed with salmonellosis infections, according to a [Mon 7 Aug 2017] update from the CDC. Among the 76 outbreak victims for whom information is available, there is a 46 percent hospitalization rate, with 35 victims having experienced symptoms so severe they had to be admitted. One person in New York City died.

Additional victims are expected to be identified because people who became ill after [Mon 10 Jul 2017] might not yet be included in the CDC's numbers because of the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks, according to the CDC.

The CDC is recommending that consumers should not eat -- and restaurants and retailers should not sell -- maradol papayas from any suppliers in Mexico until further notice.

The FDA was more specific in its outbreak update on [Mon 7 Aug 2017] evening.

"The FDA is now advising that consumers avoid Caribena, Cavi and Valery brands of maradol papayas, and all varieties of papayas from the Carica de Campeche farm located in Campeche, Mexico, as a result of the FDA's traceback investigation and testing," according to the agency's outbreak update.

"The FDA is working to identify additional brand(s) that these papayas are sold under and facilitate recall(s). Meanwhile, consumers should ask their retailers about the source of their papayas."

The fresh papayas recalled by Freshtex Produce can be identified by the Valery name on the box and labels that say grown and packed by Carica de Campeche. Freshtex Produce has ceased importing papayas from the grower, "and is taking all precautionary measures to ensure the safety of its imported produce," according to the recall notice.

The FDA has been working with state officials and the CDC to investigate the ongoing outbreak, which was 1st identified by Maryland public health staff investigating a cluster of _S._ Kiambu illnesses.

Grande Produce of San Juan, TX, recalled Caribena brand maradol papayas it distributed in Maryland and other states after people confirmed with salmonellosis reported eating the fruit before they became ill. Lab tests conducted by Maryland officials confirmed the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ on Caribena brand maradol papayas collected from a grocery store in Baltimore and from sick people's homes.

[Fri 4 Aug 2017] morning, FDA named the Carica de Campeche farm in Mexico as the source of several brands of papayas, including those distributed by Grande Produce and Agroson's that tested positive for Salmonella. "Papayas from the Carica de Campeche farm tested positive for _Salmonella_ Kiambu, _Salmonella_ Thompson, _Salmonella_ Agona, _Salmonella_ Senftenberg, and _Salmonella_ Gaminara," FDA reported [Fri 4 Aug 2017] morning.
