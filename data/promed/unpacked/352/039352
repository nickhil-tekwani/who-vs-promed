Alexander Kufaev, Vice governor (gubernator) of the Altai area (kray)
reported that sanitarian posts were organized in 11 regions of the Altai
area bordered with Kazakhstan in order to prevent foot-and-mouth disease
spreading in the area. In Kazakhstan, in three provinces, Karaganda,
Alma-Ata, and Eastern Kazakhstan, the disease was registered among the
cattle. The last time this disease was registered in the Altai area was in
1974.

[If it is in the areas claimed for Kazakhstan, we should not be surprised
if China soon reports it in the NW China provinces, though it seems that
China might be under-reporting outbreaks currently. - Mod.MHJ
