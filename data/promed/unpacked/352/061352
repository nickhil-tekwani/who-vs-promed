Coffee farmers in Mt Kenya are staring at huge losses after the crop has been affected by coffee berry disease (CBD) and bacterial blight [ProMED-mail post 20180604.5837538]. The diseases have been reported in Kirinyaga, Embu, Murang'a, and Nyeri counties. Farmers are calling on government to intervene.

Prolonged rainfall is said to have compounded the problem. A large scale coffee farmer said CBD had affected many farms. "Farmers are likely to lose up to 50 per cent of their coffee if the diseases are not controlled." He said this is the 1st time bacterial blight is affecting the crop in the region. The disease has been known to attack crops in Mt Elgon. [The] Coffee Directorate said they were educating farmers on how to control the diseases through spraying.

[Coffee berry disease (CBD; also called green berry anthracnose) is caused by the fungus _Colletotrichum kahawae_. _Colletotrichum_ species have been reported from _Coffea_ species wherever they are grown causing spotting and blackening of fruit. A virulent strain of _C. coffeanum_, a species reported from Brazil at the end of the 19th century, was considered the cause of CBD, but the CBD pathogen has since been classified as a separate species.

CBD occurs only in Africa. Of the 2 coffee species grown commercially, CBD only affects _Coffea arabica_ (arabica or highland coffee) which is usually preferred for it taste, but not _C. canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee). Losses on arabica from CBD may be up to 80 per cent. The pathogen affects flowers, immature coffee berries and sometimes the beans. Infected berries display dark sunken spots coalescing into lesions. Berry development may be arrested resulting in mummified berries on branches. Infected berries are considered the major source of inoculum, and spores are spread mainly by wind-blown rain or drops from tree tops. Disease management includes cultural practices, quarantine, and periodic fungicide treatments. Some resistant host cultivars exist and more are being developed.

Bacterial blight (also called Elgon dieback, after Mt Elgon in western Kenya) of coffee (BBC) is caused by _Pseudomonas coronafaciens_ (previously _syringae_) pv. _garcae_. It was named after Gar√ßa, the place of its 1st identification in Brazil. The bacteria survive on leaves, berries and bark; epidemics occur during cool, wet weather when entire crops may be lost. Symptoms may include water-soaked spots on leaves; shoot and twig necrosis; cankers on branches and main stem; wilting and dieback of branches. Affected plantations have a fire scorched appearance and individual trees may die. Species in the genus _Pseudomonas_ are generally spread by rain, wind, mechanical means and infected plant material. Spread with pollen is also suspected in some cases.

When CBD and BBC occur simultaneously, copper sprays have been reported to reduce both diseases. However, one of the main compounds in fungicides used to control CBD (ortho-difolatan) has been reported to stimulate BBC. Control of both diseases simultaneously by agrochemicals alone is mostly not entirely successful, but cultural and phytosanitary methods are also required.
