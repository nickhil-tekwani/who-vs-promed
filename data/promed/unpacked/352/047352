The following background data on botulism in Argentina are abstracted from the Gideon e-book series (1,2):

- Most cases of botulism in Argentina are related to home-canned vegetables, airtight packed food with inappropriate refrigeration, and aerosols.
- Rates of foodborne botulism have remained fairly constant for the past 20 years, and (as in many other countries) are exceeded by those of infant botulism -- see graph (3) http://cdn.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Botulism-Argentina.jpg.
- Virtually all cases of infant botulism have been caused by type A botulinum toxin.

- Prevalence surveys (Clostridium botulinum spores):
7.5 per cent of commercial chamomile tea samples (Mendoza province, 2008 publication)
1.1 per cent of rural commercial honey samples (Mendoza and San Luis provinces, 1997 publication)
14.6 per cent of soil samples in Entre Rios province (2003 publication)
23.5 per cent of soil samples from 5 regions (2005 publication)
Linden flower (_Tilia spp_) tea, a household remedy used as an infant sedative, has been implicated as a source of _C. botulinum_.
- A single case report of wound botulism was published in 2000.

Notable outbreaks
-----------------
1920 to 1926 -- 2 outbreaks (total 8 cases) of botulism were reported.
1974 -- An outbreak (11 cases, 3 fatal) was ascribed to cheese spread.
1979 -- An outbreak (9 cases) was ascribed to home-canned vegetables.
1982 -- An outbreak (1 case) in Mendoza province was ascribed to pickled trout.
1998 -- An outbreak (9 cases, none fatal) of type A botulism among Buenos Aires bus drivers was ascribed to matambre (meat roll).
2011 -- An outbreak (2 cases) was reported among members of a family from Chile who had eaten in a restaurant in Argentina.
