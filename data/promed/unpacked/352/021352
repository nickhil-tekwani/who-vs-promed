Disease hits Tennessee deer populations: Stricken
whitetails reported in Fayette and across Tennessee
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A disease that causes whitetail deer to develop
high fever, drink water incessantly and bleed
gruesomely has been noted all over Tennessee,
leading wildlife officials to fear that one of
the state's worst outbreaks is imminent.
Alan Peterson, a wildlife biologist with the
Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA), has
received reports of epizootic hemorrhagic disease
from across the state during the past few weeks
[6-17 Aug 2007, including a possible outbreak at
Ames Plantation in Grand Junction. Reports of the
disease are coming in earlier this year [2007] --
and from a much wider range than usual.
"We hear reports of EHD just about every summer,"
Peterson said. "But they usually don't start
coming in until late August when hunters re-enter
the woods for squirrel season. Even then, they're
usually confined to one or two areas. This
certainly seems to be something different."
Peterson said he has had "lots and lots" of EHD
cases reported from more than a dozen counties,
including Chester, Hardin, Decatur and Benton. He
said the possible outbreak at Ames is the first
report he's heard from a county "near the Mississippi River."
When reports first started coming in, TWRA
officials gathered tissue samples from deer
carcasses and sent them to be analyzed at the
University of Georgia's Whitehall Deer Research
Facility in Athens, GA. Biologists there
confirmed EHD and said the outbreak is affecting
deer all over the Southeastern United States.
"They said it's happening in Virginia, Alabama,
North Carolina -- all over the place," Peterson
said. "That certainly suggests that weather
conditions might be playing a role."
EHD is a blood-borne disease transmitted to deer
by a species of biting fly that is common across
the Mid-South and Southeastern United States.
Because much of the region is mired in a 3-year
drought, water is scarce and many deer are forced to drink from the same pools.
"That just concentrates the deer population and
gives these biting flies an opportunity to infect
more animals in one spot," Peterson said.
When deer are infected with EHD, they begin
showing signs within 7 days. Deer with lesser
strains develop a high fever and seek out
water immediately. They often have pronounced
swelling of the head, tongue, neck and eyelids and may have trouble breathing.
"For us, it would be like having the flu with no
air-conditioning," said Dr. Allan Houston, a
wildlife biologist from Ames Plantation.
Deer with highly virulent strains of the disease
experience internal hemorrhaging and often bleed
from their mouths and anuses. Death often occurs
one to 3 days after symptoms emerge.
Peterson said the disease has greatly affected
single-county deer populations in the past and
could certainly have a dire statewide effect this
year [2007] if the outbreaks are more widespread.
Houston said Ames officials began finding dead
deer in July [2007] -- and though he cannot
confirm the cause of death, he said the outward
signs certainly point to EHD. He is also
concerned that widespread EHD outbreaks, combined
with harsh environmental conditions could have
significant long-term effects on the state deer population.
"We had an unusual freeze in April that killed a
large portion of the mast crop," Houston said.
"When you consider that, plus a harsh summer,
plus an EHD outbreak and a hungry winter, I can't
predict where all of this will lead us."
The Tennessee deer hunting season begins in
mid-September, but the full effects won't be
known until the final harvest numbers are in for
each county in January [2008]. On the upside,
Peterson said, two-thirds of the deer infected
with the disease will survive -- and once they've
had the disease, they develop a natural immunity
that keeps them from being infected again.
"It's sort of like a child with the chicken pox," he said.
Female deer that have survived the disease can
often pass the immunity to their fawns through
their milk. EHD affects only whitetail deer and
poses no danger to domestic cattle or humans.
Deer that have survived the disease show obvious
scars, but their meat is safe for consumption.
Deer should be field-dressed within an hour of
death to keep bacteria from building up in the carcass.
"Their hooves can flake away due to the fever,
and the animals that recover will have split and
layered-looking hooves this fall," Houston said.
"A lot of people see that and wonder if the deer
are safe to eat -- and they are."
While there is nothing humans can do to ease the
outbreak, Peterson said, it would be helpful if
people who see dead or dying deer on their property would contact the TWRA.
"Most deer that die of EHD will be found around
water," Peterson said. "If you see a deer that's
sick or dying around water, we'd like to know
about it -- especially if that deer is bleeding
from its mouth or anus. We'd like to at least
chart the counties that are having outbreaks."
To report a dead or dying deer on your property, call (800) 372-3928.

Deadly virus attacks deer: Drought contributes to
spread of 'epizootic hemorrhagic disease'
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A number of white-tailed deer have been found
dead near ponds and streams across the region,
and state wildlife officials suspect that the
animals have died of viral disease spread by biting flies.
"We have responded to more than 30 dead deer
reports in the county over the past several weeks
and there are probably many more that have not
been reported," said Montgomery County Wildlife
Officer Jereme Odom. "Laboratory tests are being
conducted to determine the cause of the deaths,
but we suspect that it is hemorrhagic disease
which occurs periodically across the state."
Odom's comments were confirmed by Lucky Pittman,
head of pathology at the Murray State University
Breathitt Veterinary Center in Hopkinsville, KY.
"There is a widespread outbreak of epizootic
hemorrhagic disease this year [2007] that is
affecting white-tailed deer in Kentucky,
Tennessee and Indiana," Pittman said. "Outbreaks
of the disease occur every 2 to 3 years, but this
year is especially severe because of the heat and drought conditions."
Hemorrhagic disease is the most important of the
infectious diseases in white-tailed deer,
according to the Southeast Cooperative Wildlife
Disease Study at the University of Georgia. It is
a viral disease closely related to the bluetongue
virus, and is spread by biting flies. The flies,
also known as sand gnats, sand flies or
no-see-ums, are most abundant from mid-August to
late October, and they usually disappear with the
first hard freeze of the fall season.
The disease problem is compounded this year
[2007] by the record heat and drought conditions.
Water sources are drying up and deer and other
animals are concentrated around available water
sources where they are more likely to come into contact with the disease.
Hemorrhagic disease causes excessive hemorrhaging
and deterioration of blood vessels in the vital
organs of infected animals. Most deer that die of
the disease are found near water because they
develop high fevers and seek water to cool their
bodies. An outbreak of hemorrhagic disease can
kill up to 25 percent of the deer in an outbreak
area, but the mortality can be much higher in some instances.
To date, there has not been an instance where an
entire deer population has been wiped out by the
disease. Past outbreaks of the disease have also
shown up in some cattle and sheep. The deer
infection means that infected flies are present
in the vicinity, and both deer and livestock are
at risk. Once virus activity begins, both deer
and livestock serve to fuel the outbreak, but the
spread of the disease from deer to livestock, or
vice versa, has not been proven.
Livestock owners who suspect hemorrhagic or
bluetongue disease infections in their herds
should seek veterinary assistance to obtain
diagnostic confirmation of the diseases.
The white-tailed deer population of Montgomery
County probably exceeds 20 000 animals. A severe
outbreak of the disease could kill large numbers
of deer, and that may have an impact on the deer
hunting season that opens 22 Sep 2007. Otherwise,
the disease poses no threat to human health, but
hunters should not consume venison from visibly sick deer.

Disease suspected in deaths of 50 deer
-------------------------------------------
More than 50 white-tailed deer have been found
dead in southwestern Pennsylvania, suspected
victims of an insect-borne disease known as
epizootic hemorrhagic disease, according to the Pennsylvania Game Commission.
The agency on Monday revealed that samples from 4
of the deer found dead in the impact area in
Greene and Washington counties last week [13-17
Aug 2007] were sent to the Southeastern
Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study at the
University of Georgia and Penn State University
Animal Diagnostics Laboratory. Commission
spokesman Jerry Feaser said test results are expected within the next 2 weeks.
Meanwhile, commission wildlife conservation
officers are collecting information about other
dead deer being found and seeking additional reports.
"We're soliciting input from residents who may be
aware of the die-off but just haven't been asked about it yet," said Feaser.
Reports of dead deer in the impact area were
first received by the commission the week of Aug. 6.
According to Feaser, public release of the
information was delayed until Monday [20 Aug
2007, while the commission confirmed information about the situation.
"It's not like we're hiding anything," he said.
"We had to get all our ducks in order, to make sure we knew what was going on."
The commission has received no reports of
apparent kills in parts of Pennsylvania outside
the 2 southwestern counties, where EHD previously
was confirmed to have killed 70 or more deer in 2002.
However, Feaser noted, "we are hearing suspicions
in other states outside the usual range of EHD."

Deer Deaths Could Be From Insects
--------------------------------------
Wildlife officials say the deaths of more than 50
deer in southwestern Pennsylvania could be from
an insect-borne virus. The state Game Commission
is investigating the deaths of dozens of
white-tailed deer in Greene and Washington
counties since the start of the month [August
2007]. Greene County borders several northern West Virginia counties.
Spokesman Jerry Feaser says officials think the
deer died of EHD (epizootic hemorrhagic disease).
The deer had blueish tongues and reddened lungs.
EHD is a common, seasonal virus among
white-tailed deer, contracted by the bite of
insects called biting midges. EHD cannot be
spread through contact and is not passed from deer to deer.
West Virginia Division of Natural Resources
biologists have found several dead deer, and have
sent samples for testing. EHD was found in the
same vicinity in 2002. That year, the virus was
also confirmed in Maryland, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin.

[A Review of the disease may be found in the
moderator�s comments on ProMED-mail post 20070818.2701.
EHD can be very devastating to deer herds. The
disease is closely related to Bluetongue virus
that most often is known to affect cattle. EHD can affect cattle as well.
There are many farmed cervid herd in the United
States. It could have a large impact this year on
wild herds as well as some captive herds. It
should be a reportable disease in every state. � Mod.TG]
