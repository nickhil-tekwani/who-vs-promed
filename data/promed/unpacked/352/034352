[Human and canine visceral leishmaniasis, VL, is well known but rare in
Venezuela. The incidence of human VL was 0.2 cases per 100 000 population
1995 to 2000, or 242 cases. However, 26 per cent of the cases originated
from Isla Margarita. In the same period, up to 25 per cent of dogs tested
on the island were seropositive for _Leishmania_ (Zerpa O, et al.
Epidemiological aspects of human and canine visceral leishmaniasis in
Venezuela. PAHO <http://publications.paho.org> and Zerpa O, et al. Mem
oswaldo cruz 2002; 97: 1079-83). Leishmaniasis is transmitted from dogs to
humans by sandflies. - Mod.EP]
