[1] Omicron sub-variants
[A] BA.2.75
Date: Mon 11 Jul 2022

https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/public-health/1st-cases-of-newest-omicron-subvariant-ba-2-75-detected-in-us-3-notes.html


BA.2.75 is the latest omicron relative catching experts' attention, with 3 cases recently identified on the West Coast, Time reported [11 Jul 2022]. Of those, 2 cases were detected in California and one in Washington as of [8 Jul 2022], according to data from Helix, which works with the CDC on viral surveillance.

The sub-variant is gaining traction in India and has also been detected in 10 other countries.

Two more things to know:
1. The variant has a large number of mutations that may make it adept at spreading more quickly and evading antibody protection. Experts have expressed concern it could be even more transmissible than the now dominant BA.5 variant, which has been touted as "the worst version of the virus we've seen," based on its ability to evade immunity from vaccination and prior infections. Eric Topol, MD, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego, in a [4 Jul 2022] tweet cited a breakdown of BA.2.75, writing "8 mutations beyond BA.5, many in the N-terminal domain, which could make immune escape worse than what we're seeing now."

2. It's been detected in several states in India and appears to be spreading faster than other strains there, experts told Time. "It's still really early on for us to draw too many conclusions," Matthew Binnicker, PhD, director of clinical virology at Rochester, Minn.-based Mayo Clinic, told Time. "But it does look like, especially in India, the rates of transmission are showing kind of that exponential increase," adding that it is too soon to tell whether it will outpace BA.5.

Kobe City announced that a new mutant virus called BA.2.75, which is one of the strains of the omicron strain of the new coronavirus, has been confirmed in the city. The city says it is the 1st confirmation in the whole country, not including cases of domestic quarantine.

According to the city of Kobe, on [24 Jun 2022], a woman in her 40s in the city had symptoms of coughing and fever, so when she visited a medical institution where it was confirmed that she was infected with the new coronavirus. After that, when the city collected a sample and analyzed the genome, it was found that it was a new mutant virus called "BA.2.75" of the "BA.2" strain of the omicron strain.

The woman had not traveled within 14 days before the onset of the disease, and no contact with people who have traveled abroad has been confirmed. Kobe City states that "the possibility of community-acquired infection cannot be ruled out."

According to the city, the mutant virus was 1st identified in India last month [June 2022], and there is currently no clear data on infectivity or risk of aggravation, and WHO is increasing surveillance.

The city says the mutant virus has been confirmed for the 1st time in the country, not including those cases in quarantine.

Hatsumi Yamazaki, director of the City Health Bureau, said, "Even if it is a mutant strain, the basic infection prevention measures are the same as for the conventional strain. I want you to ventilate and wash your hands to reduce the risk of infection as much as possible."

[The new omicron subvariant BA.2.75 has mutations in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein that interacts with the human cell receptors. However, of note "It's still too early to know if this sub-variant has properties of additional immune evasion or indeed of being more clinically severe". Monitoring of emerging variants and subvariants of concern is important in predicting upcoming increase in cases, thereby serving as an important tool in response planning. - Mod.UBA]

[C] BA.5 spread
Date: Wed 13 Jul 2022

Nearly two-and-a-half years since the coronavirus pandemic began, the most infectious and transmissible variant yet has arrived.

Repeated COVID-19 waves have left millions of people dead, with only vaccines helping to blunt the toll. Now the virus is spreading again -- evolving, escaping immunity and driving an uptick in cases and hospitalizations. The latest version of its shape-shifting, BA.5, is a clear sign that the pandemic is far from over.

The newest offshoot of omicron, along with a closely related variant, BA.4, are fueling a global surge in cases -- 30% over the past fortnight, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

In Europe, the omicron subvariants are powering a spike in cases of about 25%, though Dr. Michael Ryan, the executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Program, has said that number may actually be higher, given the "almost collapse in testing." BA.5 is on the march in China, ratcheting anxieties that major cities there may soon re-enforce strict lockdown measures that were only recently lifted. And the same variant has become the dominant strain in the United States, where it accounted for 65% of new infections last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

"We have been watching this virus evolve rapidly. We've been planning and preparing for this moment. And the message that I want to get across to the American people is this: BA.5 is something we're closely monitoring, and most importantly, we know how to manage it," said Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House's COVID-19 response coordinator, in a news briefing on Tuesday [12 Jul 2022].

On the same day [12 Jul 2022], WHO's Emergency Committee said COVID-19 remained a Public Health Emergency of International Concern -- its highest level of alert, 1st declared on 20 Jan 2020 -- amid rising cases, ongoing viral mutation and increasing pressure on already overstretched health systems. In a statement, the committee, which is made up of independent experts, highlighted challenges to the ongoing global COVID-19 response, including a drop-off in testing and spotty genome sequencing, raising the question of just how accurately any nation might reasonably be able to monitor BA.5.

Official data dramatically undercount the true number of infections in the US, epidemiologists say, leaving the nation with a critical blind spot as the most transmissible coronavirus variant yet takes hold. Some experts think there could be as many as 1 million new infections every day in the broader US population -- 10 times higher than the official count.

As for how to manage the new wave, Jha urged Americans aged 50 and older to get 2nd booster shots. Adults who are up to date with vaccinations are less likely to be hospitalized than those who are unvaccinated. But only about 1 in 4 adults in the US over 50 have gotten their recommended 2nd boosters, data collected by the CDC show.

US health officials are urgently working on a plan to allow 2nd COVID-19 boosters for all adults, a senior White House official confirmed to CNN on Monday [11 Jun 2022], amid fears that younger adults' immunity may be waning as COVID-19 cases rise with the dominance of BA.5.

What makes BA.5 different? Eric Topol, a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research, has called BA.5 "the worst version of the virus we've seen." He explained in a recent newsletter: "It takes immune escape, already extensive, to the next level, and, as a function of that, enhanced transmissibility," well beyond earlier versions of omicron.

In other words, BA.5 can easily evade immunity from previous infections and vaccines, increasing the risk of reinfection. Though the variant does not appear to lead to more severe illness, in an interview with CNN on Monday [11 Jul 2022], Topol said that given the extent of BA.5's immune evasion, he expects to see an escalation in hospitalizations, as we've seen in Europe and elsewhere that the variant has taken root. "One good thing is it doesn't appear to be accompanied by the ICU admissions and the deaths as previous variants, but this is definitely concerning," he added.

Public health experts in the US may take some solace from the trajectory of the variant in Europe. WHO's Ryan said last week that while many European countries are experiencing a jump in hospitalizations, "what we're not seeing is an increase in intensive care unit admissions, so the vaccines are very much still working and it is those gaps in immunity that are causing the problem."

But still, steep reductions in COVID-19 surveillance worldwide are hindering epidemiologists' efforts as they race to trace the virus' evolution.

"Sub-variants of omicron, like BA.4 and BA.5, continue to drive waves of cases, hospitalization and death around the world," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a media briefing on Tuesday [12 Jul 2022]. "Surveillance has reduced significantly -- including testing and sequencing -- making it increasingly difficult to assess the impact of variants on transmission, disease characteristics, and the effectiveness of counter-measures."

"New waves of the virus demonstrate again that the COVID-19 [pandemic] is nowhere near over," he added.

You Asked. We Answered
----------------------
Q: How should I protect myself amid the new COVID-19 wave?

A: At this point in the pandemic, many people may not want to plan their lives around COVID-19 anymore -- especially if they're generally healthy. On the other hand, those with underlying health conditions or who have concerns about long-haul symptoms are still trying to play it safe. Given just how contagious the new omicron subvariants are, avoiding infection does require some planning and consideration, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen explains.

"I don't think that most people should have to change their daily activities, but I do think people need to be aware of their risk of contracting COVID-19 if they don't take additional precautions," Wen said. The question to ask yourself, she added, is this: How much do I want to continue to avoid infection?

For individuals who want to reduce their risk, Wen advises that they stay up to date with their boosters (in the US, everyone age 5 and older can receive a 1st booster, and those 50 and older can receive a 2nd booster for a total of 4 shots). She also recommends wearing a high-quality N95 mask or equivalent in indoor, crowded settings, and staying outside for large gatherings as much as possible -- something easier to do in the summertime.

"For those who find masks uncomfortable, I'd encourage mask-wearing in the highest-risk settings -- for example, mask while in a crowded security line at the airport and during boarding and deplaning," she said.

First COVID vaccine mandate enforced in mainland China
------------------------------------------------------
Beijing last week announced a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for residents wanting to enter public venues, becoming the 1st city in mainland China to do so as it attempts to contain the spread of BA.5. Those who are "not suitable" for vaccination will be exempt from the requirement, a city official said, without clarifying how they can provide the proof needed for exemption.

The vaccine mandate comes as Beijing reported 3 cases of the highly contagious omicron subvariant. Several Chinese cities have imposed new curbs after detecting BA.5. Shanghai, which only recently emerged from a 2-month lockdown, identified its 1st case on Friday [8 Jul 2022] and will perform 2 rounds of COVID tests this week. An outbreak of BA.5 has already shut down the northwestern city of Xi'an, home to 13 million people, where entertainment, sports and religious venues have been closed, and restaurants limited to takeaway and delivery services.

Casinos in the gambling hub of Macao were ordered to shut for the 1st time since February 2020 because of a COVID outbreak, sending shares of their operating companies plunging, and fears of new lockdowns in Shanghai undermined the broader China market. Chinese stocks remained under pressure after Monday's [11 Jul 2022] sell-off fueled by the threat of new COVID restrictions, especially the tech sector.

Drug-resistant infections and deaths have risen among hospital patients
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The US had made significant progress in fighting drug-resistant infections in recent years. But those gains were largely erased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with hospital-acquired infections and resulting deaths rising 15% in 2020, according to new data.

A special report released Tuesday [12 Jul 2022] by the CDC found that more than 29 400 people died from antimicrobial-resistant infections in the 1st year of the pandemic -- nearly 40% of those deaths were among people who got the infection while in the hospital. The full number is probably even higher, given that data for half of the 18 pathogens identified as threats are unavailable or delayed.

WHO has called antimicrobial resistance a "silent pandemic," and drug-resistant infections were linked to nearly 5 million deaths globally in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic probably contributed to the increased risk in the US, particularly because many people delayed care or left infections untreated -- either because of closed clinics or fear of exposing themselves to COVID-19 -- which can increase the risk of developing drug resistance.

Pulse oximeters don't work as well for people of color
------------------------------------------------------
Often when Dr. Thomas Valley sees a new patient in the intensive care unit at Michigan Medicine in Ann Arbor, he clamps a pulse oximeter on their finger -- one of the many devices he uses to gauge their health and what course of care they require, whether they are a child having seizures, a teenage car accident victim or an older person with COVID-19.

But recently, Valley, an assistant professor in the University of Michigan's Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, realized that the small device may yield less accurate oxygen readings in patients with dark skin. If the device isn't calibrated correctly, the darker pigmentation can affect how the light is absorbed by the sensor, leading to flawed oxygen readings and patients being discharged when they shouldn't.

The findings of Valley and his colleagues add to a growing body of research -- dating back to the 1980s -- that suggests flawed pulse oximeter readings among Black and brown patients can be a real and life-threatening issue in medical care. But the public has only recently been made more aware of this health disparity, and US health officials have announced plans to investigate the accuracy of pulse oximeters.

Advice for anxious new moms
---------------------------
Edith Bracho-Sanchez, director of pediatric telemedicine and assistant professor of pediatrics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, didn't think she'd be an anxious mom. But that changed when she had her son. "I stress over every decision I make for William. I make long pro and con lists, I discuss everything with my partner, sleep on things and ultimately, I pray," she wrote in a recent column for CNN.

Knowing how difficult it is to make decisions -- big and small -- she said she understood why some parents might struggle with the choice to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. This is why she says she did it, and her advice to anxious new moms like her:

• First, COVID-19 is an unpredictable illness. While most children have minor symptoms and recover well, many have landed in hospitals and emergency rooms, and to date, more than 400 children under the age of 5 have died from the illness in the US alone, according to the CDC. We also don't yet fully understand the long-term effects of the disease.

• 2nd, I know the vaccine is in the body for a short period of time and with a specific mission. It instructs the body to make protective antibodies against COVID-19, and the body's own cellular mechanisms quickly break it down soon after

[2] ECDC and EMA update recommendations on additional booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines
Date: Mon 11 Jul 2022
Source: ECDC [edited]
https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ecdc-and-ema-update-recommendations-additional-booster-doses-covid-19-vaccines


The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are recommending that 2nd booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines be considered for people between 60 and 79 years old and people with medical conditions putting them at high risk of severe disease.

In April 2022, both agencies recommended that people over 80 years of age be considered for a 2nd booster. However, the agencies noted at the time that it might be necessary to consider 2nd boosters in people between 60 and 79 years old and vulnerable persons of any age if there was a resurgence of infections.

2nd boosters for people above 60 years and vulnerable persons
-------------------------------------------------------------
As a new wave is currently underway in Europe, with increasing rates of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, it is critical that public health authorities now consider people between 60 and 79 as well as vulnerable persons of any age for a 2nd booster. These could be administered at least 4 months after the previous one, with a focus on people who have received a previous booster more than 6 months ago. Currently authorised vaccines continue to be highly effective in reducing COVID-19 hospitalisations, severe disease and deaths in the context of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Stella Kyriakides, the European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety said that 'Our COVID-19 vaccines work, and offer good levels of protection against severe illness and hospitalisation. With cases and hospitalisations rising again as we enter the summer period, I urge everybody to get vaccinated and boosted as quickly as possible. There is no time to lose.

'I call on Member States to roll-out 2nd boosters for everyone over the age of 60 as well as all vulnerable persons immediately and urge everyone eligible to come forth and get vaccinated. This is how we protect ourselves, our loved ones and our vulnerable populations.'

'We are currently seeing increasing COVID-19 case notification rates and an increasing trend in hospital and ICU admissions and occupancy in several countries mainly driven by the BA 5 sublineage of omicron," said Dr Andrea Ammon, the Director of ECDC.

'This signals the start of a new, widespread COVID-19 wave across the European Union. There are still too many individuals at risk of severe COVID-19 infection whom we need to protect as soon as possible. We need to remind people of the importance of vaccination from the very 1st shot to the 2nd booster. We have to start today.

'We expect that adults 60 years and older and medically vulnerable populations will need a 2nd booster dose. These are the groups most at risk of severe disease and giving a 2nd booster to those groups now will avert a significant number of hospitalisations and deaths from COVID-19.

'I am aware that it requires a significant effort from public health authorities and society at large to achieve this goal. But now at the beginning of a new wave is the time to make the extra effort. We have several safe and effective vaccines available, and every single COVID-19 infection prevented now is a potential life saved.'

2nd boosters in the wider population
------------------------------------
At the moment, there is no clear evidence to support giving a 2nd booster dose to people below 60 years of age who are not at higher risk of severe disease. Neither is there clear evidence to support giving early 2nd boosters to healthcare workers or those working in long-term care homes unless they are at high risk.

However, residents at long-term care homes are likely to be at risk of severe disease and should be considered for booster doses in line with national recommendations.

ECDC and EMA have called on public health authorities across the EU to plan for additional boosters during the [2022] autumn and winter seasons for people with highest risk of severe disease, possibly combining COVID-19 vaccinations with those for influenza.

National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) will ultimately make national decisions on who should get 2nd boosters, taking into account the situation in their countries.

Adapted vaccines
----------------
The latest ECDC/EMA advice comes amid work to adapt vaccines for the omicron variants of concern.

'We are working towards possible approvals of adapted vaccines in September [2022],' said EMA's Executive Director, Emer Cooke, noting that 'our human medicines committee is currently reviewing data for 2 adapted vaccines.'

'In the meantime, it is important to consider using currently authorised vaccines as 2nd boosters in people who are most vulnerable. Authorised vaccines in the EU continue to be effective at preventing hospitalisations, severe disease and deaths from COVID-19, even as new variants and subvariants continue to emerge.'

She added that 'Authorities in the EU are working closely with the World Health Organization and international partners on policies concerning adapted vaccines.'

ECDC and EMA will continue to closely evaluate emerging vaccine effectiveness and epidemiological data and will update their recommendations accordingly. Further details about the latest advice on 2nd booster doses is available in the ECDC/EMA joint statement.

Neither is there clear evidence to support giving early 2nd boosters to healthcare workers or those working in long-term care homes unless they are at high risk." This appears to be an appropriate strategy for booster vaccinations going forward, as both the course of the pandemic and potential booster shots requirements will require periodic reevaluation. - Mod.UBA]
