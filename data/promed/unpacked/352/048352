A 12-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital recently with suspected Japanese encephalitis [JE], prompting the state veterinary department to immediately collect blood samples from pigs in farms near his home.

State executive councilor for health Dr Afif Bahardin said the case is still being monitored and is yet to be confirmed as the disease by the state health department and Health Ministry.

"The veterinary department has started collecting blood samples from pig farms in Kampung Selamat in Tasek Gelugor to test for the virus," he said when contacted. The blood samples will be tested for the virus which causes the disease. Results will take between 24 to 48 hours.

He said the veterinary department and the health department will work together to monitor and conduct preventive measures in the area. "We will also be conducting fogging in the area as a preventive measure," he said.

JE is a type of viral brain infection [that is caused by a virus] that is spread through mosquitoes. The virus is often found in pigs and birds and is spread when mosquitoes bite infected animals.

Dr Afif advised those living in the area to seek immediate medical care if they have symptoms such as prolonged fever, headaches, nausea and vomiting.

[Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, is endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). There was a significant outbreak of JEV infections in 1998-1999. The current case is well within the endemic area. A subsequent report issued on 30 Jun 2014 in The star (http://www.thestar.com.my/News/Nation/2014/06/30/Boy-coma-Tasek-Gelugor-JE/) indicated that the JEV infection has been laboratory confirmed. The 1 Jul 2014 issue of The Malay Mail (http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/boy-with-japanese-encephalitis-out-of-danger-zone) indicated that the boy, after several days in the intensive care unit, is now out of danger, but with the risk of neurological sequelae.

The veterinary and public health authorities are testing pigs in the area where the case occurred for antibodies because pigs are amplifying hosts of JEV. Birds, especially ardeids, are reservoir hosts of the virus, which is transmitted by _Culex_ mosquitoes. The 30 Jun 2014 edition of The Malay Mail (http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/health-ministry-says-16-japanese-encephalitis-cases-since-january) reported that a total of 16 Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases has been reported nationwide since the start of the year (2014), including 4 deaths, according to the Malaysia Health Ministry.
