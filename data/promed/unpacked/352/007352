[1] UK (Suffolk): ducks, HPAI H5N1

More than 82 000 ducks are to be culled amid an outbreak of bird flu, Suffolk Trading Standards said. The H5N1 strain was found at the Gressingham Foods site at Debach, near Woodbridge, over the weekend. The company's Redgrave site was affected earlier this month [March 2022], and 35 000 ducks had to be culled there.

The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has urged poultry keepers in Suffolk to "step up their efforts" as the UK faces its "largest outbreak". Chief veterinary officer Dr Christine Middlemiss said the UK was seeing its "worst" ever avian flu outbreak. She said Suffolk in particular had seen a large increase in infections amongst wild birds. Although there was "no direct evidence" people were helping to spread the virus, Dr Middlemiss urged farmers and keepers to be "absolutely, scrupulously clean" when moving between sheds and bird housing.

Sasha Watson, from Trading Standards, who described the latest case -- the 5th in the county in a month -- as a "very big outbreak", said the 82 400 ducks would be culled over the next few days.

[2] Spain (Andalucia): turkeys, HPAI H5N1

The Central Laboratory of Algete, in Madrid, has today [22 Mar 2022], confirmed a new outbreak of avian flu in Andalucia. On this occasion, it has been detected in a fattening turkey farm in the Sevillian municipality of Arahal. A total of about 17 700 birds are believed to be on the farm. It is located within the radius of the surveillance zone previously declared by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Sustainable Development in a neighbouring municipality.

This latest outbreak brings the total of [outbreaks] detected in Andalusia to 28. As detailed by the Junta de Andalucia, 22 of them are in the province of Sevilla, and the remaining 6 in Huelva.

An abnormal increase in the mortality of animals on the Arahal farm was detected last Tuesday [15 Mar 2022]. The official veterinary services of the Junta de Andalucia were notified, and the established protocol was followed, with samples taken and sent to the Central Laboratory of Algete for analysis. The veterinary services of the Andalucian administration immediately proceeded to isolate the affected farm. A rigorous epidemiological survey was conducted to find out the possible origin of the outbreaks.

This can help to establish if other farms are at risk due to the movement of people and vehicles from the affected facility. In addition, all the birds on the farm were slaughtered, while the feed and other materials that could carry the virus were disposed of. Similarly, a restriction zone has been established around the outbreak, with a 3 km [1.9 mi] protection zone, and a 10 km [6.2 mi] surveillance zone.

As in the previous outbreaks detected in the provinces of Sevilla and Huelva, the analysis carried out has shown that it is avian influenza of the H5N1 subtype. This is the one that has been affecting Europe in recent months. Although it has not shown any zoonotic potential, exposure to birds showing any symptoms consistent with the disease or found dead in the field is not recommended.

[The current HPAI H5N1 epizootic, which started in Europe in September 2021, seemed to have peaked during the 2nd week of 2022, decreasing until the 8th week; the number of outbreaks has again been increasing across Europe since the 9th week of 2022. During the 10th week, a total of around 230 outbreaks in poultry have been reported to the OIE in Europe (see Figure 3 in DEFRA's weekly outbreak assessment No 19, dated 21 Mar 2022, at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1062932/hpai-europe-220321.pdf).

The increase is mainly due to the outbreak in France. Cases of HPAI infection in wild birds are decreasing week on week.
