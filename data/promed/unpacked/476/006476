A serious bacterial infection has shut down Toronto's largest
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and it could last weeks, putting
severe strain on a system that is already at maximum capacity.
Women's College Hospital, where the region's most vulnerable
premature babies are cared for, this week stopped accepting high-risk
pregnancy transfers, as well as [premature babies] born at other
hospitals, after an outbreak of methicillin-sensitive _Staphylococcus
aureus_ (MSSA) could not be contained.
"[The closing] means that mothers will have to be transferred to
other cities, out of province, even out of country to Buffalo," Mary
Vearncombe, director of infection control at Women's College and at
Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, told The Globe and Mail yesterday,
8 Mar 2007, referring to a period in 2005 when several Ontario
mothers-to-be were sent to the USA because of an overall shortage of
neonatal intensive-care space.
"The neonatal intensive care system is at capacity all the time. So
when you take an element of the system out, then somebody is really
going to feel the pinch."
Dr. Vearncombe said the outbreak was partly caused by extremely
crowded conditions -- the perfect breeding ground for the spread of
infection -- at the neonatal intensive care unit. The unit's 41 beds
and surrounding medical equipment in the decades-old building are
each squeezed into just 2.8 sq. mt. (30 sq. feet) of space, which is
less than a third of the recommended minimum of 9.3 sq. mt. (100 sq. feet.)
NICU staff at Women's College noticed the 1st case of infection in
early January 2007. It spread, and a number of preventive measures --
including separating infected and healthy babies and having NICU
staff wear gloves and gowns at all times -- were put into place. That
didn't work, and an emergency closing was the only option.
"You always have to balance off which is the bigger risk," Dr.
Vearncombe said. "Is it a bigger risk to admit babies to the unit
when the outbreak is going on? Or is it a bigger risk to say we're
not going to admit babies to the unit knowing that mothers are going
to be sent somewhere else?"
The 41 babies remain at the hospital, but hospital staff have cleared
the NICU rooms to clean them out. Premature babies are extremely
vulnerable to infections that are often harmless to full-term babies.
Many infants at Women's College, as small as 500 grams, have
developed abscesses, pneumonia, eye infections, and blood infections.
No deaths have been reported, and Dr. Vearncombe would say only that
"several" babies have infections.
Ontario Ministry of Health spokesman, A.G. Klei, said the ministry
was aware of the closing of the NICU, and that all babies in the unit
would be tested.
Michael Marrin, a neonatologist at McMaster Children's Hospital in
Hamilton, said the Women's College closing will likely send other
neonatal units across the province scrambling. "It's going to put
pressure on both the obstetric and neonatal units," he said, adding
that the Hamilton facility will try to accommodate as many mothers
and babies as it can. "But the fact of the matter is, our absolute
1st priority has to be the safety of the patients we already have
under our care."
The closing of 41 beds at Women's College is significant because the
province has only about 200 "Level 3" beds, which are for premature
babies who need the most monitoring and care.

[ProMED has carried a fair number of posts regarding
methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA) from Canada and elsewhere,
particularly when it has been community-acquired. This neonatal
cluster is related to MSSA (methicillin-sensitive _S. aureus_.) MSSA
does not receive the publicity of its more drug-resistant cousin but
remains a significant pathogen in the community as well as in the hospital.
The outbreak also underscores that inadequate space, creating
overcrowding, can trump even aggressive infection control procedures
to cause hospital-acquired infections to spread.
ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Fisman for contributing this posting. - Mod.LL]
