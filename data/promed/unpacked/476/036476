An anthrax outbreak is reported in Shymkent. 2 brothers were taken to the hospital in a serious condition. Both have cutaneous form of anthrax, Astana TV channel reported. The men were taking care of cattle at their farm.

Epidemiologists tested the cattle and the test results for anthrax were negative.

More than 20 people contacted the men. They all remain under medical observation.

"We assume some of kind of slaughter is the source of infection. Anthrax is transmitted from animals, especially the cutaneous form of anthrax. Shymkent and nearby districts of Turkestan region are anthrax unfavorable areas," Shymkent's chief epidemiologist Balkumys Musaeva said.

[To find Shymkent in south central Kazakhstan, go to https://www.worldmaps.info/maps/screen/KZ/kz.jpg. Until 2018, Shymkent was the administrative center of South Kazakhstan Region. On 19 Jun 2018, it was taken out of South Kazakhstan and subordinated directly to the government of Kazakhstan. As a result, the administrative center of the region is moved to Turkistan, and the region was renamed as Turkistan Region; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shymkent

Livestock anthrax is essentially enzootic along the southern border of Kazakhstan, and thus their doctor's insight as to how these 2 farmers got infected. - Mod.MHJ
