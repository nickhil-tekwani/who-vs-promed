Measles outbreak
----------------
The number of positive measles IgM specimens increased markedly during
September [2009] with 246 positive cases compared with 99 in August [2009],
bringing the total for the year to 414. Most of these patients (372 or 90
per cent) were from Gauteng [province]. Of the Gauteng patients, 296 (80
per cent) were from the the Tshwane district [the district municipality
around Pretoria]. However during the past month there have been 35 and 31
cases in Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg respectively. Ages were known for 405
(98 per cent) patients and ranged from 2 months to 54 years with a median
of 12 years.

Sporadic outbreaks of measles at not uncommon in the Johannesburg-Pretoria
region, an area undergoing quite rapid urban growth. The South Africa
immunization schedule indicates that measles vaccine should be given at 9
months with a booster at 18 months. The State of the World's Children 2009
(UNICEF) gives the measles immunization coverage rate in 2007 at one year
as 83 per cent based in information supplied by the National Department of
Health.
