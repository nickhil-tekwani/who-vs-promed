African swine fever in Georgia
------------------------------
In response to the moderator's comment in the 4th posting on the
African swine fever [ASF] outbreak in Georgia [African swine fever -
Georgia (04): FAO 20070610.1891], it seems unlikely that any perusal
of the records of official imports will reflect an eastern African
origin of the virus. Genotype II viruses have only been found in
Zambia, Mozambique, and Madagascar, as reflected in the very
interesting posting from Chris Oura and Linda Dixon at Pirbright.
None of these countries, as far as I know, are exporters of pork.
Therefore, the probabilities are either illegal imports, or
"international swill", or an unknown focus of the disease closer to
Georgia than Africa.

[We share Dr Penrith's argument that an east-African origin of
officially traded infected pork seems unlikely, while an "unknown
focus of the disease closer to Georgia than Africa" is more likely.
However, the possibility that pork exporting country(ies) have
misdiagnosed ASF should be excluded the earliest to prevent similar
introductions to other importing countries, and before turning to
other potential sources of infection, such as the illegal
international trade routes. It will be interesting to note whether
countries exporting pork to Georgia include those in which porcine
diseases of unclear etiology have been observed.
In this respect, may we repeat our recommendation (see ProMED-mail
20070609.1886) that countries experiencing unusual disease
occurrences in swine, follow Georgia's example and submit samples to
one of OIE's reference laboratories for confirmation, even if initial
tests in national laboratories are found negative. - Mod.AS]
