[2] WHO situation report 18 Mar 2015
Date: Thurs 18 Mar 2015 [corrected 19 Mar 2015]
Source: WHO Global Alert and Response (GAR), Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases, Ebola virus disease situation reports: Ebola response roadmap [edited]
http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-18-march-2015


A total of 150 new confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in the week to 15 Mar [2015], compared with 116 the previous week. There were 95 new confirmed cases reported in Guinea: the highest weekly total for the country in 2015. Sierra Leone reported 55 new confirmed cases over the same period: the country's lowest weekly total since late June 2014. Liberia reported no new confirmed cases for the 3rd consecutive week. 15 Mar 2015 was day 12 since the final patient in Liberia had a 2nd negative test for EVD (42 days must elapse before transmission can be considered to have ended).

A total of 12 districts in Guinea and Sierra Leone reported a confirmed case in the week to 15 Mar [2015], all of which lie on a geographically contiguous arc in and around Conakry to the north and Freetown to the south. An additional 4 districts have reported a confirmed case in the past 21 days: Kono and Tonkolili in central and eastern Sierra Leone, and Lola and Macenta in eastern Guinea.

Though transmission is currently confined to a relatively narrow geographic corridor, the population is highly mobile, with a great deal of movement throughout surrounding districts and countries. Limiting the movements of cases and contacts is challenging but essential to prevent the seeding of new outbreaks.

Key response indicators for Guinea suggest that there remain significant challenges to overcome before transmission is brought under control. Of 49 total reported EVD deaths in the week to 15 Mar [2015], almost half (23) were identified post-mortem in the community. In the week to 8 Mar [2015], a low proportion (2 per cent) of confirmed cases arose from registered contacts, and there were a reported 18 unsafe burials. Taken together, these indicators suggest that the outbreak in Guinea is still being driven by unknown chains of transmission.

In the week to 15 Mar [2015] a total of 125 suspected cases of EVD were reported in Liberia, none of whom tested positive for EVD. All contacts associated with the last known chain of transmission have now completed 21-day follow-up.

By contrast with Guinea, key response indicators for Sierra Leone present a more promising outlook. In the week to 8 March over 2/3 (67 per cent) of confirmed cases came from registered contacts, whilst in the week to 15 Mar [2015], 6 of 62 total EVD-confirmed deaths were identified post-mortem in the community. There was 1 reported unsafe burial over the same period. However, there are still areas where most new cases arise from unknown chains of transmission. Kambia, a district north of Freetown on the border with the Guinean prefecture of Forecariah, reported 7 new cases in the week to 8 Mar [2015], 5 of which came from post-mortem testing of people who had died in the community and who were not known to be contacts of a previous case.

A meeting was held in Freetown on 14-15 Mar [2015] to finalise guidelines for the safe decommissioning of Ebola Treatment Centres and Community Care Centres when and where appropriate.

11 new health worker infections were reported in the week to 15 Mar [2015]: 3 in Conakry and 1 in Forecariah, Guinea, and 7 in Sierra Leone (4 in Bombali, and 3 in Port Loko). This brings the total number of health worker infections reported across the 3 most-affected countries since the start of the outbreak to 852, with 492 deaths. In addition, 2 EVD-positive health workers and a number of close contacts were medically evacuated to Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America in the week to 15 Mar [2015].

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
----

There have been over 25 000 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (table 1), with over 10 000 reported deaths (outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 95 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea, 0 in Liberia, and 55 in Sierra Leone in the 7 days to 15 Mar [2015].

The total number of confirmed and probable cases is similar in males and females (table 3). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), people aged 15 to 44 are approximately 3 times more likely to be affected. People aged 45 and over are nearly 4 times more likely to be affected than children.

A total of 852 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 492 reported deaths (table 5).

[4] Comment in response to RFI (Ebola update (50): Guinea, Sierra Leone Internationals exposed, RFI, susp 20150317.3237401)
Date: Wed 18 Mar 2015
From: Prof. S. Mehtar <smehtar@sun.ac.za> [edited]


Having just returned from Sierra Leone after training over 130 healthcare workers, I believe it has become clear that there is much confusion about several aspects of IPC [infection prevention and control] in the country. The main confusion lies with the lack of evidence when applying IPC precautions and the assumption is, that IPC is ONLY about personal protective equipment (PPE). This in itself is confusing, since most of the various agencies have their own way of wearing and removing PPE, seriously confusing the national HCW. Unfortunately, some of the "IPC trainers" are not trained themselves and therefore "read and apply" without much thought to risk assessment. It is noteworthy that these "IPC experts" teach Sierra Leone nationals IPC when the latter have dealt with almost 5000 cases of Ebola since the start of the outbreak and are still alive and well! The information that we get from the IPC SL group is from the ground -- the community. That is where the emphasis of IPC and transmission containment should be; but unfortunately, this is not always possible and there are clear territories of activities which need to be merged and work together with the traditional and community leaders, as suggested by ICAN [Infection Control African Network] in April 2014.

[5] Monrovia: vaccine trial problems
Date: Thu 19 Mar 2015
Source: Business Day live [edited]
http://www.bdlive.co.za/life/health/2015/03/19/fear-and-loathing-in-monrovia-over-ebola-trials


While the US is helping to lead a large study of 2 vaccines against Ebola, they are confronting the same volatile mix of scepticism, fear, false rumour and mistrust that helped to spread Ebola in the 1st place. "When we look at Ebola, it came from America," says Sylvester George, a pastor's assistant, expressing doubt about the clinical trials at an information session. "It's a manmade virus. So why didn't they do this trial in America?"

In a study in Liberia with 2 Ebola vaccines is the most ambitious, with US researchers from the National Institutes of Health and their Liberian counterparts hoping to enlist more than 27 000 participants under an agreement between their governments. The trial's scale alone has posed tough ethical and practical questions. US and Liberian officials have debated how to attract so many volunteers, how much to pay them and how to mobilise the public to extinguish crippling rumours before they take root, like the one asserting that Ebola vaccines were being slipped into children's immunisations.

And there is an added layer of mistrust, directed at one of the most important partners in the trial: the Liberian government. After a government minister called on Liberians to "step up" and volunteer to test a new Ebola vaccine, angry callers on talk radio asked why no high-ranking government official had got a shot in the arm. A local radio reporter asked whether signing a consent form was tantamount to a "death warrant" for volunteers. A daily newspaper said simply, "Liberians are not animals." Scientists have been left scrambling to win the trust of the Liberian people on the ground.

"This concept of social mobilisation, 'said Dr Clifford Lane, who is leading the trial for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the US government research agency. " I came to realise it is one of the most critical things for success in this country." In August 2014, even as Monrovia was rapidly becoming the centre of the outbreak, many Liberians denied Ebola's existence. Distrustful of a government widely perceived as corrupt, they believed the authorities were exaggerating the gravity of the disease to get money from international donors. This made it harder to convince people to take lifesaving precautions like isolating sick relatives. The distrust only deepened after the government deployed troops to enforce a blanket quarantine on a neighbourhood in Monrovia, leading to deadly riots over a tactic that President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf later called a mistake.

But as deaths multiplied throughout the capital, volunteer groups emerged, led by community leaders who educated fellow residents about Ebola and imposed measures on their own to curtail its spread. Their efforts contributed to the sudden drop in Ebola cases in mid-October 2014, weeks before the huge rise in international assistance expanded treatment options. "There were some false starts, but we built on the lessons from the false starts," Dr Stephen Kennedy, the lead Liberian investigator in the vaccine trial, said of 2014's efforts to combat the epidemic. "The lesson was that using formal and informal community structures had an impact on the epidemic in Liberia. So for this trial, we are building on that."

The West African trials mark the 1st time vaccines are being tested in the context of an outbreak, although the waning case load may make it more difficult to answer the ultimate question -- whether they really protect people from contracting Ebola. In the Liberian trial, which is expected to last about 1 year, participants will be given 1 of the 2 vaccines, or a placebo, at 10 locations in and around Monrovia. On Tue 17 Mar 2015, researchers finished vaccinating an initial batch of 600 volunteers at Redemption Hospital, which was used as an Ebola holding centre a few months ago. Officials said they had made sure participants fully understood the consent forms -- a critical issue in places with high illiteracy and low education levels, as in Liberia. Explanations of risks and potentially unfamiliar concepts, such as placebos and randomised trials, are given in Liberian English or, if need be, in 1 of the 16 local languages.

For 10 visits over the course of almost a year, the 1st 600 participants will each be handed USD 300: USD 40 on the first visit, less on subsequent visits, and USD 150 at the end. The money is supposed to compensate participants for transport costs and lost wages. "The ethics of it is compensation for inconvenience," said Lane, the lead US researcher. "You don't pay people to be part of medical research." Some of the US researchers have argued that the USD 300 compensation -- the equivalent of USD 30 for each visit to the hospital -- is too high, especially in a city where many people earn less than USD 5 a day. One Liberian newspaper announced the 1st hospital visit's compensation in huge print on its front page: "US40." But Kennedy, the lead Liberian researcher, argued that compensation must be calculated by looking at the cost of living and the multiple jobs many Liberians hold to make ends meet.

For Liberia's trials, Joseph Boye Cooper, a Liberian working for the effort, has gone out to neighborhoods, answering questions, allaying fears and recruiting volunteers. Cooper, who was a leader in a large volunteer Ebola watchdog group in 2014, uses the word "study" instead of "trial", which he said invariably caused listeners to ask defensively, "Why do you want to try this vaccine on me?" Before visiting neighborhoods, Cooper is careful to park the team's SUV several blocks away and take a motorbike taxi to his destination. Arriving in a big car would merely fuel popular suspicions about government waste and corruption, he said. "They'll say I'm eating Ebola money and I must share some with them," he said. After 1 meeting inside a church, about half of the 24 listeners gave Cooper their names and cellphone numbers. The next morning, at 7am, Cooper stood along a main road, waiting for the volunteers. With nobody after 20 minutes, he took out his cellphone. "You just getting up, oh?" he said to one person, adding, with feeling: "I know. So how long will it take for you to get ready?" Eventually, about a dozen showed up, including people from the day before. Samuel Weah, who had been convinced after listening to Cooper, said he had unsuccessfully tried to get family and friends to join him. "They said they want more Ebola patients because government is using them to make money," he said. "The more dead and infections, the more money. "But," he added, "some said I should go and take the lead 1st. They said if nothing happens to me, they might come next."

[6] Vaccine storage device
Date: Wed Mar 18 2015
Source: Intellectualventureslab [edited]
http://www.intellectualventureslab.com/invent/modified-arktek-to-support-ebola-vaccine-trials


In response to the Ebola outbreak, researchers are launching clinical trials in Sierra Leone and Guinea to determine the efficacy of Ebola vaccine candidates. An important requirement in keeping the Ebola vaccine safe and effective throughout a trial is keeping the vaccines at extremely low temperatures until being thawed for injection.

Due to the urgency of the Ebola outbreak, exceptionally low temperatures are required to store and transport the vaccine candidates. In the absence of separate studies that look at the efficacy of vaccines at different storage temperatures, a storage device was needed to keep the vaccine candidates between negative 60 and negative 80 degrees Celsius, while they were being transported and distributed among healthcare workers. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified conditions for a storage device to safely transport vaccines in Sierra Leone and Guinea, including:

1. Stay cold (between negative 60 and negative 80 degrees C) for a minimum of 3 days without external power, in extreme heat
2. Very low probability of device failure (i.e., the temperatures will be maintained)
3. Store enough vaccinations for 200 doses at a time, and treat a community of up to 9000 people
4. Be intuitive and easy to use for health workers
5. Be transportable portable enough for long-distance travel on rough roads
6. Require minimum maintenance
7. Keep a robust log of vaccine temperatures
8. Track performance and location

A passive vaccine storage device, the Arktek (trademarked), employs super insulation techniques similar to those used to store cryogenic fluids and protect spacecraft from extreme temperatures. Once stocked with water ice, the Arktek can keep life-saving vaccines at appropriate temperatures for 1 month or more, without any source for external power. The Arktek was initially designed for vaccines that required storage temperatures between 0 and 8 degrees C under a wide range of ambient temperatures, including environmental temperatures of 43 degrees C. The temperature difference for the Ebola vaccine trials are 3 times that of the initial Arktek use case, negative 60 to negative 80 degrees C storage temperatures in up to 43 degrees C environmental temperatures. Fortunately, the original Arktek design allowed significant modifications to the device to meet the very specific standards and constraints outlined by the WHO and CDC for Ebola vaccine trials, chief among the requirements are the temperature requirements for the vaccines: negative 60 to negative 80 degrees C.

To determine if a modified Arktek could meet the requirements of the Ebola vaccine trials, the designers needed to identify a material to replace the water ice used for thermal storage inside the Arktek, a material to keep the vaccines at such low temperatures. In the developed world, dry ice is the material of choice for storage temperatures between negative 60 to negative 80 degrees C because of its high energy storage by weight, however it is unavailable in the Ebola-affected areas. A phase change material (PCM), designed for negative 78 degrees C, was a potential alternative. However very little information on the material was available. Thankfully, the negative 78 degree C PCM worked, and was able to keep vaccines cold inside a modified Arktek for over 6 days, one of the requirements outlined by the WHO and CDC.

At negative 60 to negative 80 degrees C, materials can become very brittle and shrink; different materials will shrink at different rates as the temperature changes. When you have parts made of different materials joined together and expose them to extreme temperature change it adds stress to the parts. If the stress if high enough, the parts can break. Vaccine trials require carefully maintained data on the vaccine candidates, so that the research can focus on the efficiency of the vaccine. And part of the monitoring system requirements is that it has to notify the vaccine team if the vaccines were nearing the safe temperature range. Such a system was developed that provided a warning, 1day before the vaccines exceed the safe range. This would give the vaccination team enough time to retrieve and recharge the modified Arktek. A multitude of tests were also performed in order to determine the optimal way to use the device. The modified Arktec is being used in the present trials.

[An important achievement, of public health importance, but it would be helpful to know the cost. The temperature was maintained for more than 6 days, which is excellent, with a warning 1 day before the vaccines exceed the safe range. But a Revco -- or a standby generator -- will be required to refreeze the blocks. - Mod.LK]
