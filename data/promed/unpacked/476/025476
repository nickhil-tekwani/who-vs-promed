[This has been an active eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) season in
the United States, with an unusually large number of cases in horses
and a human death associated with this zoonotic disease. So it is not
surprising to get a report from Belize where earlier this fall [2009]
the active animal health authorities reported Venezuelan equine
encephalitis (VEE), a similar mosquito-borne disease. Belize is also
the only country to have reported EEE to the OIE WAHID database since
2005, where they found it in the same province reported here, Cayo.
It was also reported in 2005 in a wide geographic range of South
American countries including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, and
Venezuela.

It is interesting that there are no reports of this disease from 2006
through 2009 in the Americas region, even though it has been an
active EEE season in the United States and maybe elsewhere. The fact
that countries that have the disease -- we know the United States
does, given the long thread ProMED-mail has developed on EEE this
season -- and don't report it to OIE is probably more indicative, to
some degree, of the remnants of "silo based thinking" about the
animal and human spectrum of disease. Even though EEE's potential for
widespread occurrence in animals is fortunately limited because of
the availability of a vaccine, it is important that this vector-borne
zoonotic disease gets reported up the chain to animal health
authorities as far as OIE, so that animal health can play a vital
role in forwarding a comprehensive picture of zoonotic diseases in a
wide variety of hosts.

It just seems odd that there are no reports of this important disease
in animals (and humans) this year (2009) in the OIE WAHID database.
Furthermore, it is odd that we know we have the disease in the United
States and Belize, but no reports from Mexico. In any case,
congratulations to Dr Victor Gongora and his animal health staff for
reporting important mosquito-borne equine encephalitides such as EEE
and the earlier VEE. - Mod.PC]
