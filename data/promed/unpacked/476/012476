Preliminary test results indicate the chronic wasting disease (CWD)
agent was present in 5 hunter-harvested deer collected in Hampshire
County, [West Virginia], during the 2008 deer firearms hunting season.

"As part of our agency's ongoing and intensive CWD monitoring effort,
samples were collected from 1355 hunter-harvested deer brought to
game checking stations in Hampshire County and one station near the
southern Hampshire County line in Hardy County," noted Frank Jezioro,
director for the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources [DNR].
The 5 CWD positive deer included one 4.5-year-old doe, two
2.5-year-old bucks, one 4.5-year-old buck, and one 1.5-year-old buck.

All 5 of the latest positive deer were harvested within the Hampshire
County CWD Containment Area, that portion of Hampshire County located
north of US Route 50. However, the CWD agent previously has been
detected outside the containment area but still within Hampshire
County. The area in Hampshire County appears to continue to expand,
as one of the most recent infected deer was approximately 5 miles [8
km] northeast of any previous known infected deer location.

The disease has now been detected in a total of 37 deer in Hampshire
County -- 2 road-killed deer, one in 2005 and one in 2008; 4 deer
collected by the DNR in 2005; 5 deer collected by the DNR in 2006;
one hunter-harvest deer taken during the 2006 deer season; 3 deer
collected by the DNR in 2007; 6 hunter-harvested deer taken during
the 2007 deer season; 11 deer collected by the DNR in 2008; and 5
hunter-harvested deer taken during the 2008 deer season.

The DNR will continue to update management actions designed to
control the spread of this disease, prevent further introduction of
the disease, and possibly eliminate the disease from the state as
information from deer testing within West Virginia is gathered and
scientists across the country provide more information on how to
combat CWD in white-tailed deer.

Thus far the following disease management actions have been
implemented by the DNR within Hampshire County:
1. CWD testing efforts designed to determine the prevalence and
distribution of the disease.
2. Deer population management to reduce the risk of spreading the
disease from deer to deer by implementing appropriate antlerless deer
hunting regulations designed to increase hunter opportunity to
harvest female deer.
3. Establish reasonable, responsible, and appropriate deer carcass
transport restrictions designed to lower the risk of moving the
disease to other locations.
4. Establish reasonable, responsible, and appropriate regulations
relating to the feeding and baiting of deer within the affected area
to reduce the risk of spreading of the disease from deer to deer.
