[As a result of food poisoning,] up to 2000 tourists fell ill during
their stay at the Bahia Principe Hotel in the Dominican Republic,
The [Sunderland] Echo reported last week [6-12 Aug 2007] how [a man,
his fiancee, and a 14-year-old daughter], from Sunderland [County
Durham, England], got caught up in the holiday from hell. Today [13
Aug 2007, the man said he] was pleased the authorities had
investigated the outbreak, but claimed the probe should have been
launched much sooner. "I'm glad they've taken responsibility and
found out what was causing it, but they should have stopped people
from going there much earlier -- 600 people fell ill while I was
there," he said.
Solicitors Irwin Mitchell, who are acting on behalf of more than 400
guests, said they were unsurprised by the Dominican Republic
authorities' findings -- after hearing about the hotel's
uncleanliness from their clients.
Clive Garner said: "These latest findings point to a major breakdown
in health and hygiene standards at the Bahia Principe and again, I
question why guests have been sent to this hotel in the recent past,
when the risk to guests' health should have been evident."

The Vice-president of the Dominican National Hotels and Restaurants
Association (ASONAHORES) says that the case of the food poisoning
outbreak that affected more than 200 British tourists at a resort in
Gaspar Hernandez will not affect the flow of foreign visitors to the
country, after learning that the situation was under control.
Arturo Villanueva said that the Dominican health and tourism
authorities "have been taking absolute control, as requested by the
international authorities. The hotelier said that the owners of Hotel
Bahia Principe had followed all the requirements, to the extent that
they had closed down the resort to new arrivals. Provincial governor
Cesar Jose de los Santos commented that what had happened in the
hotel would not affect the image of other hotels in the region.
The infection is believed to have been caused by a norovirus, which
is low risk and can strike anywhere in the world, usually in cooler
(non-tropical) climates, and it is believed, therefore, that it was
brought over by one of the hotel guests.
Health ministry official, Dr. Nelson Rodriguez, said that people
traveling to this part of the country should be aware of the problem,
taking the necessary precautions to prevent infection. This
information was delivered during a teleconference with health
representatives from the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and
France.

The 1st indication of this outbreak was the temporary quarantining of
an aircraft at Glasgow (Scotland) International airport on arrival
from the Dominican Republic on 9 Aug 2007. The reports above identify
a single hotel in the resort of Gaspar Hernandez, catering for
foreign tourists (predominantly from southern Scotland and the north
of England), as the source of a norovirus outbreak that may have
affected as many 2000 tourists.
It remains to be established whether the virus was introduced with
the European tourists, as believed by the Dominican Republic
authorities, or as a consequence of poor standards of hygiene at this
particular hotel, as believed by the visitors. - Mod.CP]
