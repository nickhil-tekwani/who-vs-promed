Tullia's is recalling Italian Meatless Pasta Sauce code 530140. This recall has been initiated because a records review by the Washington State Department of Agriculture revealed that one batch of sauce produced with the 530140 code had a pH level high enough to allow the growth of _Clostridium botulinum_. If present, this organism can cause botulism, a serious and potentially fatal foodborne illness.

Foodborne botulism is a severe type of food poisoning caused by the ingestion of foods containing the potent neurotoxin formed during growth of the organism. Foodborne botulism can cause the following symptoms: general weakness, dizziness, double-vision and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension and constipation may also be common symptoms. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention. Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled.

Recalled sauce is packaged in 16 oz. and 32 oz. clear glass bottles with white caps. The code can be found on the label and is in blue ink. The only code of Tullia's Italian Meatless Pasta Sauce recalled is 530140.

The recalled sauce was sold in the following markets in the Spokane area: Rosauers (Rosaures, Huckleberries Natural Market and Super 1 Foods on 29th Ave, Spokane); Yokes Fresh Market(s); Egger's (West Rosewood); Trading Company Stores (only Spokane, Spokane Valley); Main Market; and Albertson's no 242 (Wandermere Mall).

Tullia's has made the decision to recall this product to ensure the safety of their customers. The company has not been notified of any illness associated with their products.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
