Pet owners in Flintshire [north east Wales] are being warned to be on the
alert against an outbreak of a virus that is fatal to rabbits. Vets have
reported record numbers of rabbits being brought in with the deadly
myxomatosis virus. Staff at Daleside Veterinary Surgery, in Shotton, have
dealt with 11 cases in the past 2 weeks, including 5 in just one day. Vet
Rowena Siddorn says it is uncommon to see more than a dozen cases within a
6 month period. "We normally see cases from about August or September
through to January or February," she said. "We usually see about half a
dozen cases during that time, but we have seen a lot more this year [2009]
than any other year."

The virus, which can cause blindness, is spread by fleas and mosquitoes and
a pet rabbit does not have to come into contact with an infected wild
rabbit in order to contract it. Ms Siddorn added: "Unfortunately it can't
be treated. I have only ever had one rabbit survive in the last 10 to 15
years. "If an animal has got it then we would advise euthanasia. It is a
very distressing virus for rabbits, particularly the ones in the wild
because they can't see to eat. It is very pitiful because they either
starve to death or eaten by predators."

Ms Siddorn believes the recent warm spell could be the cause of the virus
taking hold. She added: "We have had quite a dry period and it's been warm
for the last month, which might explain why there are more mosquitoes
about." Symptoms include swelling to the eyelids, nose, inner ear, and
genitals and the animal may become lethargic and lose its appetite.

Pet owners are now being urged to vaccinate their rabbits against the
disease and to use a special flea treatment. Owners who are concerned are
advised to telephone their nearest vet.

Myxomatosis facts
-----------------
Myxomatosis was deliberately introduced in Australia in 1950 an attempt to
control a rabbit infestation. 2 years later it was illegally introduced in
France and, as a result, quickly spread to the rest of Europe.

When it first arrived in Britain in 1953, it almost wiped out the entire
rabbit population, killing 99 per cent of the 100 million rabbits living in
the wild. At the time, the Ministry of Agriculture attempted to contain the
outbreak, but this proved to be impossible and it was eventually left to
run its course.

The last serious outbreak was in 2005 when epidemics where confirmed
throughout the UK.

Vaccination is now available, but only one in 10 domestic rabbits across
the UK have been immunised.

Rabbit killer disease puts Hayling islanders on alert
-----------------------------------------------------
Rabbit owners are being warned to vaccinate their pets after a killer virus
swept across a coastal community. Scores of wild rabbits have succumbed to
myxomatosis on Hayling Island [England]. Dozens of dead animals have been
spotted at Hayling Golf Club and at North Common, a beauty spot frequented
by walkers.

The cause of the outbreak is thought to be a combination of a hot summer
and biting insects, including mosquitoes that have thrived in the warmer
weather. The virus, which causes death in 12 days, is spread by fleas and
mosquitoes, which have been a problem on the island for some years. Experts
say the virus is rife this year but Hayling might have been worse affected
because it is a confined area.

Monique Turk, manager of The Cat and Rabbit Rescue Centre, in Sidlesham,
near Chichester, said: "Myxomatosis is rife at the moment. We would
recommend that everyone gets their rabbits vaccinated. It's a horrible
death for the rabbit." But Mrs Turk said it was unlikely the island's
rabbit population would be wiped out. She said: "Because of how quickly
they reproduce, it's unlikely. There will always be one female who doesn't
get it."

The government's Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, which
oversees animal disease epidemics, said it was not taking any action.
Stephen Dear, environmental health manager at Havant Borough Council, said:
"Myxomatosis is not a notifiable disease and has no specific treatment. In
the wild death usually occurs in 12 days. "The virus does not affect any
other mammals. Havant Borough Council will deal with any dead rabbits found
on our own land. If private landowners want advice if they find a dead
rabbit on their property they should contact the council's environmental
health team."

Myxomatosis
-----------
Myxomatosis almost wiped out the rabbit population when it arrived in
Britain in 1953. First identified in Edenbridge, Kent, it spread rapidly
around the country, killing as many as 99 per cent of the 100 million
rabbits living wild at the time.

The disease's symptoms include listlessness and anorexia as well as
swelling of the rabbits' heads, eyelids, and genitals.

Wild rabbits have some immunity, but Britain's 1.6 million domestic rabbits
have none.

The vaccine costs up to GBP 30 [about USD 48]. Although it is not 100 per
cent effective, more than half of vaccinated rabbits who become infected
survive.
