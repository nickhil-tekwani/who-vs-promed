Comment on the Taxonomy of Lyssaviruses
--------------------------------------
The terminology used in the message regarding the epidemiology and
diagnosis of the patient in Scotland is confusing and may be one reason the
diagnosis has proven to be difficult [see "Rabies (EBLV 2), human - UK
(Scotland): suspected (02) 20021120.5852"]. The report indicates that
"rabies" is suspected. Rabies is a disease caused by Rabies virus.
Specifically, the report suggests that the cause is "a rabies virus
[European Bat Lyssavirus), which can be carried by bats." First of all,
what the report likely meant to say is that the patient has "rabies" or "a
rabies-like illness" and that the causative agent is a European bat
lyssavirus. There is no such virus as "European bat lyssavirus"

The lyssaviruses (family _Rhabdoviridae_, genus _Lyssavirus_) comprise the
following species: _Australian bat lyssavirus_, _Duvenhage virus_,
_European bat lyssavirus 1_, _European bat lyssavirus 2_, _Lagos bat
virus_, _Mokola virus_, and _Rabies virus_, as well as Rochambeau virus, a
tentative (provisional) member of the species.

If the patient is suspected of having "rabies", then diagnostic tests
should be directed towards that virus. If the patient is suspected of
having an infection with European bat lyssavirus 1 (or European bat
lyssavirus 2), then diagnostic tests should be directed towards that virus.
Given that these are all "rabies-related" viruses, it is likely that
antibody to rabies virus would detect antigens of European bat lyssavirus 1
(or European bat lyssavirus 2), but the antigen titer in the patient's
tissue might be low, or the antibody in the patient's serum (the newspaper
report, of course, does not indicate which is being tested) might be low
and, in either case, cross-reactivity might not be adequate for diagnostic
purposes. The best course would be to test for European bat lyssavirus 1
and European bat lyssavirus 2 along with rabies virus, rather than using
rabies virus as a surrogate.

These viruses are very poorly named and their flaccid nomenclature almost
always leads to virologic, epidemiologic, and diagnostic confusion. This
report is no exception.

[The reference for the current taxonomy of the genus _Lyssavirus_ is "Virus
Taxonomy", 7th Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of
Viruses, Ed. by M.H.V. van Regenmortel et al., pp 570-571, Academic Press,
2000. The report states that genetic characterization at several genomic
regions (N, P and G) supports the subdivision of the genus into seven
genotypes (now designated as species): Genotype 1 - Rabies virus, genotype
2 - Lagos bat virus, genotype 3 - Mokola virus, genotype 4 - Duvenhage
virus, genotype 5 - European bat lyssavirus 1, genotype 6 - European bat
lyssavirus 6, genotype 7 - Australian bat lyssavirus. The genus is defined
by the possession of cross-reacting antigenic sites on the N protein,
detected by immunofluorescence and complement fixation.
Cross-neutralization is variable according to species, and monoclonal
antibodies can be employed to identify species rapidly. The 2 European bat
lyssaviruses are more similar to each other than to the other members of
the genus. The journalist responsible for the report can hardly be expected
to have an accurate appreciation of these matters.

It is clear that the suspicion that the condition of the unfortunate
patient is a consequence of infection by European bat lyssavirus 2 is an
extrapolation from the detection of this virus in the UK for the first time
earlier in the year. No other rabies-related virus has been identified as a
cause of neurological disease in the UK since 1992, apart from infections
acquired abroad.

In relation to European bat lyssavirus cross-protection, it is generally
accepted that the human diploid cell rabies vaccine offers protection
against EBLV 6 (genotype 6), but there is some dispute in relation to the
level of cross-protection against EBLV 1 (genotype 5), with 2 reports
suggesting a lack of efficacy in a murine model (A.R. Fooks., personal
communication).

In humans, standard rabies vaccine is used for pre- and post-exposure
protection against EBLV 1 or 2. The only 3 fatalities occurred in
unvaccinated individuals, so it is assumed that standard (i.e.. against
genotype 1) rabies vaccine is at least partially protective. Various animal
experiments, however, suggest otherwise. The following is a quote from a
monoclonal antibody paper: "It could improve efficacy of rabies
vaccination, used either alone or in conjunction with human rabies immune
globulins or monoclonal antibody cocktail to supplement their lack of
cross-reactivity to European bat lyssavirus 1."

There seems to have been only one study of human responses to vaccination
(Herzog et al, Clin Exp Immunol 1991 Aug;85(2):224-30). The abstract of
their paper reads as follows: "T and B cell human responses to European bat
lyssavirus (EBL1) induced by post-exposure rabies vaccination (PM virus
vaccine) were evaluated by measuring plasmatic titres of EBL1-specific
neutralizing antibodies; specific EBL1-binding antibodies; and
proliferation indices of peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated in vitro
with EBL1.

These parameters for vaccination efficacy were compared with those obtained
with vaccine-related viruses (CVS and ERA) and with a non-vaccine-related
virus. Mokola virus, the last implicated in vaccination failures. 22
patients exposed to rabies risk who received a reduced rabies post-exposure
vaccination were involved in the study. On day 21, vaccine induced
CVS-specific neutralizing antibodies in all patients; but EBL1-specific
neutralizing antibodies were induced in only 73 percent of patients. No
vaccine had Mokola-specific neutralizing antibodies. Patients having
EBL1-specific neutralizing antibodies were usually those in whom
vaccination induced high titres of CVS-specific neutralizing antibodies. On
day 21, peripheral blood lymphocytes of 86 percent of patients could be
re-stimulated in vitro with vaccine, 43 percent with EBL1 and 45 percent
with Mokola. Patients exhibiting a high vaccine-specific proliferation
response more likely developed an EBL1- or a Mokola-specific proliferative
response. No correlation was found between T- and B-cell responses. Rabies
vaccination induced neither T- nor B-cell EBL1-specific responses in 22
percent of patients."

I find these data difficult to interpret, because it seems that the level
of cross-reactivity corresponded to the general reactivity of the patient.
Also it is not clear whether any of the patients had contracted EBl-1
infection. as opposed to being at risk. - Mod.CP]
