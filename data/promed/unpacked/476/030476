December 2, 1997.
Luxembourg declared its first BSE case, a Born After the Feed Ban cow [so
called BAB cows were born after institution of the ban on feeding meat and
bone meal to ruminants - Mod.PC]
The press release from the Luxembourg ministry of Agriculture states that
the Agriculture minister of Luxembourg confirmed the first BSE case in
Luxembourg. The first symptoms were observed in September, but the official
veterinarian was called in October and suspected BSE. Brain samples were
made on 11th of October sent to the national laboratory, which gave the
positive result on 26th of November, confirmed by Weybridge on 1st of
December.
The minister said that it would be possible that the cow contracted BSE via
meat and bone meal, and some MBM bought in Netherlands is suspected but
investigations are going on.
Only one cow of the BSE herd (farm 2, which is near German border) will be
killed. But the 85 cows of the farm where the BSE cow was born (farm 1)
will be slaughtered. This cow had been sent to the other farm (from 1 to 2)
at the end of 1995. Veterinary authorities suspect a contamination through
a veal feed. Another heifer was bought by farm 2 from farm 1 at that time
(end of 95). This cow is still in farm 2 and will be slaughtered and
examined for BSE.
