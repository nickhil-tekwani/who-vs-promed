Food poisoning killed thousands of foxes at Finnish fox farms last weekend
in the largest case of poisoning in the world's top pelt producer,
authorities say. Local media said some 20 000 foxes died. Authorities, who
said thousands of foxes died at 30 to 40 farms after being fed on Fri 4 Oct
2002, have not ruled out intentional poisoning.

Finland is the world's top fox pelt producer and a leading mink pelt
producer.

"They got some sort of poison in their food. But we don't know yet what the
stuff is," Finnish Fur Breeders Association spokeswoman Kati Petersen-Waris
said on Monday.

The National Veterinary and Food Research Institute said it was Finland's
biggest animal poisoning case and it was too early to rule out anything.

Finland produced some 1.7 million fox pelts last year, which were mainly
sold abroad. In neighbouring Norway, another major pelt producer, a 1995
outbreak of botulism killed about 150 000 mink, or over half of the
country's production, Petersen-Waris said.

[From the news item it appears that there has probably been a common-source
supply of feed to the fox farms. More information on the results of the
epidemiological/toxicological investigation will be helpful. - Mod.AS]

[It would be helpful to know the clinical signs in the foxes. Also, were any
necropsies performed, and what was the outcome of those examinations? -
