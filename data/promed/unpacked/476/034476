ANGIOSTRONGYLOSIS, FOX - SWITZERLAND

The fox population in Switzerland [is estimated to have tripled] in the
past decade. The observed urbanization of the fox in several Swiss cities
during the same time may be linked to this population increase. Altered
population parameters may provide the basis for shifts in the prevalence of
infectious diseases, especially parasitoses.
For the past 2 years, we have [performed necropsies on] all foxes sent to
our laboratory originating from the city of Basel. The main purpose of this
study was to monitor the prevalence of _Echinococcus multilocularis_ (a
type of tapeworm), however, conventional coprological (fecal) tests were
also included to search for any other parasites. Besides detecting the
common protozoa and helminths regularly found in Swiss wild foxes, we have
recently identified _Angiostrongylus vasorum_ larvae in a fox (shot in
December 2000), a parasite never before found in wild animals.
As _A. vasorum_ is extremely rarely found in Switzerland at all, and then
only in dogs with a previous sojourn to endemic areas such as southern
France or Italy, we consider Switzerland to be free of this helminth (also
based upon searches in MedLine and Wildlife Worldwide by The Swiss Wildlife
Information Service, BIODOC, and the US Fish & Wildlife Reference Service).
Last week, we obtained another fox originating from exactly the same area.
_A. vasorum_ was again identified by coprological and histopathological
means. Based upon the repeated finding of _A. vasorum_ in wild foxes, we
concluded [that] the parasite has started to become autochthonously
transmitted in the referenced area. We remind readers that 2 similar events
(new establishment of parasite transmission) had been reported years ago in
Denmark and in Cornwall/England. Both areas have remained endemic to date.
Given our findings, we believe a closer observation of the situation is
needed. Thus, we recommend all veterinarians in Switzerland and in the
French and German vicinity of Basel to pay particular attention to the
local dog population (symptomatology: pulmonary and functional circulatory
disorders, optionally leucocytosis and eosinophilia). We [would be grateful
if] etiologically proven cases of angiostrongylosis [could be reported] to
our laboratory or to veterinary public health authorities in Switzerland.

[Some nematodes inhabit the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation. For
example, _Angiostrongylus vasorum_ (lungworm) and _Dirofilaria immitis_
(heartworms), both found in dogs in certain areas of the world, may be
associated with pulmonary disease. Clinical signs related to the cardiac or
pulmonary syndrome or to a combination of both may occur. - Mod.TG]
