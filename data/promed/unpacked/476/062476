[2] Indonesia - 73rd fatal case

An Indonesian teenager died of bird flu in the bustling capital
[Jakarta], bringing the [death] toll in the country hardest hit by
the virus to 73, a Health Ministry official and doctor said on Friday
[6 Apr 2007]. The 15-year-old girl was admitted to the Sulianti
Saroso Hospital for Infectious Diseases on Monday [2 Apr 2007] and
died late Thursday [5 Apr 2007], said Sardikin Giriputro, a doctor at
the facility. "By the time she arrived, it was too late," he said.
"She died after experiencing multi-organ failure."
Health Ministry official Muhammad Nadirin confirmed that the girl's
lab tests showed she had contracted the H5N1 virus, apparently after
coming into contact with infected pet birds at her home in central
Jakarta.
Bird flu has killed at least 170 people since it began ravaging Asian
poultry stocks in 2003, hitting Indonesia the hardest, according to
the World Health Organization. It remains hard for people to catch,
and most human cases have been linked to contact with sick birds.
