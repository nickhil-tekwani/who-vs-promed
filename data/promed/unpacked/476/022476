MENINGITIS & INVASIVE MENINGOCOCCAL INFECTION - FLORIDA, USA (3)
================================================================
In a recent publication of mine (Trends in Microbiology,
3:186-192, 1995; reprints available), I summarized data
compatible with meningococcal outbreaks being
associated with outbreaks of a second, unrecognized
immunomodulating microorganism. I also speculated on epidemic
spread and increases in frequency of carriage rate also being
dependent on an unrecognized microorganism, which
might differ from the one responsible for immunomodulation.
Under circumstances where the bacteria present in the carrier
population are clonally homogeneous, or where they are rapidly
spreading and colonizing numerous individuals, meningococci
isolated from disease outbreaks will be clonally
homogeneous. Under conditions where the carrier bacteria
contain several clones capable of causing invasive disease,
disease outbreaks will be clonally heterogeneous. Examples
of major epidemics which are clonally homogeneous as
well as other which were clonally heterogeneous exist.
A general summary of the global epidemiology of epidemic
disease may also be found in a different recent
publication of mine (Meningococcal disease, edited by
K. Cartwright, John Wiley, 1995, pp. 159-175; the book
is a wonderful compendium of review articles;
reprints of my article are also available).
