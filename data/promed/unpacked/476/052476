Measles carrier may still be at large
-------------------------------------
Public health officials are concerned the original carrier of a
recent outbreak of measles may still be at large after it was
determined that none of 4 reportedly infected people has travelled
recently, effectively ruling them out as the source.

Officials said measles continues to have potentially serious
consequences, and a warning will be in effect for the Greater Toronto
Area at least until the end of April [2008] should no new cases be
reported. Despite obvious concern, the risk to the general public is
described as low, thanks to extremely high immunization levels.

"When we know that measles was acquired in the city, that's what
concerns us because that means that some people somewhere have the
infection and are transmitting it to others unknowingly," said Vinita
Dubey, associate medical officer of health for Toronto Public Health.

The 1st case was confirmed on 1 Apr 2009, when an Oakville man in his
30s was diagnosed. Since then, 3 cases have sprung up in Toronto in a
10-year-old girl, a 34-year-old woman, and a 42-year-old man. A 4th
is being investigated. The woman had been vaccinated once as a child;
single vaccinations give only about 85 per cent immunity. Doctors
encourage 2 doses. The others had not been immunized.

"About 1 in 1000 people who get measles die from it, and about 1 in
1000 get the virus infecting the brain, leading to permanent brain
damage," said Monir Taha, associate medical officer of health for the
Halton Region Health Department. Both he and Dr Dubey said it is more
common for patients to spend a week in bed sick.

Health officials said their worries are mitigated by the high
immunity rate in North America. About 94 per cent of school age
children in Canada have had both vaccinations. Health Canada
generally considers adults born before 1970 to be naturally immune.
Symptoms include cough, runny nose, and fever, followed by a rash.

[Dr Fisman has commented that: "This outbreak is ongoing at this time
[Thu 10 Apr 2008]. The reported number of cases currently stands at
5. Although rates of vaccination in Toronto are believed to be high,
the city likely has enclaves with lower rates; more recent media
coverage has indicated that the index case travelled quite widely
within the city while infectious, and individuals at a Wal-Mart store
and clinic and an emergency room attendees may have been exposed.
