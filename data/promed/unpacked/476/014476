Mystery Virus Devastates U.S. Chili Crop (edited)
A mysterious virus is expected to destroy 80 percent of the chili crop in
southern New Mexico, the home of nearly half of the fiery peppers consumed
in the United States,
officials said on Wednesday.
State agriculture officials said it was too early to say what impact the
disease, called curly top, would have on prices consumers pay for whole
chilies as well as salsa and other chili condiments.
"It's a very significant problem, and experts are working to see what's
causing it," said Erik Ness, spokesman for the New Mexico Farm and
Livestock Bureau.
Ness said southern New Mexico experienced heavy winds and cold during a
critical time in the crop's growth period, which may have weakened the
plants and made them more susceptible to diseases.
However, he said large chili fields across the border in northern Mexico
experienced almost identical weather conditions but have not been stricken
with the curly top virus.
Experts are wondering if insecticides, banned in the United States but
still used in Mexico, may be a factor, Ness said.
The virus, which causes chilies to dry up and curl on the stalk, is
affecting spicy jalapeno, cayenne, and sweet bell peppers.
The vast majority of chilies consumed in the United States are home-grown,
with 46 percent coming from southern New Mexico, Ness said. Last year the
region's chili crop sold for $58 million.

[The causal virus is no mystery. Curly top disease is caused by beet curly
top geminivirus (BCTV) which is spread by the beet leafhopper. Many chili
fields in New Mexico exhibited symptoms of curly top, and Natalie Goldberg
at New Mexico State University confirmed that BCTV was the only virus
detected in 14/21 pepper samples. Curly top occurs annually but the
disease may be more pronounced this year because of a poor stand. - Mod.DH]
