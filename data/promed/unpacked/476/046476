So far, 343 cattle and buffaloes have died after being infected by an unidentified disease. Moreover, nearly 500 to 600 cattle have been affected by the disease at Bathan, Srihati, Sarulah, Halogaon, and Bamundi near Sualkuchi [Kamrup district] in the last 2 weeks. The disease has broken out in an epidemic nature among the cattle of the char areas [islands of silt within rivers], including Sarudia, Bardia, Laheswari, and Gariyadia char.

The epidemic broke out after the 2nd wave of floods on the sandy grass land, which is being used by the farmers of Bathan, Srihati, Sarulah, Halogaon, Bamundi etc., for their cattle. Meanwhile, the outbreak of the disease has claimed 343 cows and buffaloes in the char areas.

The [affected farmers] tend milch [milk] cows in the grass land of the greater char areas of the Brahmaputra [River]. The livestock farmers alleged that the State Veterinary department did not take necessary steps to prevent the disease. So the death toll is increasing day by day and the disease in spreading in the entire catchment areas of the Brahmaputra, they told this correspondent.

One of the farmers claimed that the medicine supplied by the district veterinary department was too meagre to meet the demands of the sick cows and buffaloes. He further added that veterinary doctor and paramedical staff were not sufficient to offer service in the vast area. Another farmer said that the cause of the disease was yet to be ascertained and so the medical treatment of the sick cows was not effective. The Halogaon State Veterinary Hospital in-charge, Dr Naba Sarma, while briefing this correspondent, said that a team of veterinary doctors has been dealing with the affected cattle. The district veterinary department has supplied free medicine, including saline bottles. He admitted that the medicine supplied is sufficient though the disease has already spread to vast areas. He said that he had written to the veterinary department to supply more medicine and staff to cope with the situation.

Meanwhile, SK Ray, DC [deputy commissioner] of Kamrup visited the disease-prone areas on 9 Oct 2012 and took stock of the situation. He met the farmers and shared their sorrows. The farmers demanded compensation for their lost cattle and requested the DC to take immediate steps to prevent the disease. Ray said that he would discuss the matter with the Veterinary College Hospital authority and take initiative to send a team of experts to ascertain the cause of the disease.

[The report does not include any information on the clinical signs, duration, post mortem findings, or profiles of the affected cattle and buffalo populations. Diagnostic effort is urgently needed, addressing a list of potential non-infectious as well as infectious candidate agents, checking the possible involvement of the reported floods and investigating the health status of other animal species (such as goats) on the affected farms. Special attention deserves to be paid to potential public health/food safety hazards (such as leptospirosis). Results of the investigations will be appreciated.
