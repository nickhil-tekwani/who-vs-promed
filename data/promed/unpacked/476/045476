Anthrax kills 9 livestock animals in Sask., herd isolating
-----------------------------------------------------------
Nine livestock animals are dead and the rest of the herd is in quarantine after the Ministry of Agriculture reported on Wednesday [23 Aug 2022] that anthrax was found on a pasture in southwest Saskatchewan.

The ministry said in a statement the deaths occurred on a farming operation in the Rural Municipality of Piapot near Maple Creek. It did not identify the type of animals exposed to respect the privacy of the producer, though confirmed it was not cattle. Livestock such as bison, cattle, sheep and goats are highly susceptible.

"I can only imagine it would be very traumatic," said Wendy Wilkins, a disease surveillance veterinarian with the ministry, in an interview. "For one, you're walking out there to check on your animals, and you find a dead animal or even worse, multiple dead animals, and then you find out it's anthrax. Anthrax is scary."

Wilkins said this is the 1st anthrax case this year [2022] in the province. It generally comes in the form of spores caused by a certain bacteria, she said, and is normally sporadic.

Agriculture ministry urges caution after 12 animals die from anthrax
--------------------------------------------------------------------
After the death of 12 animals in the RM [rural municipality] of Piapot, Sask. due to anthrax, Saskatchewan agriculture is reminding producers to be on the lookout for anthrax in their animals.

Anthrax is a bacteria found in the soil and it infects mammals. Some mammals like dogs are very resistant, whereas cattle and bison are more prone to the bacteria. Farm dogs and cats should be kept away from carcasses. The anthrax forms spores that can survive in the environment for years, even decades.

There is an effective vaccine available and Dr. Wendy Wilkins, Disease Surveillance Veterinarian, Ministry of Agriculture says that if producers are concerned about anthrax they should get it. "If producers are asking themselves if they are vaccinated for anthrax, then they probably should be vaccinating for anthrax," Dr. Wilkins said.

"If you think that you can absorb the cost of losing 10% of your herd overnight to anthrax. Sure, choose not to vaccinate, but the vaccine itself is not that expensive in comparison to the economic losses you would incur if animals were to start dying," she said.

[Some authorities get over cautious about what they reveal, but they forget the greater good in better informing the rural community and getting a better response if the readers can identify with the specific events published. Given the sparse details shared I would suspect it is a sheep flock that has suffered these deaths. Just a hunch. - Mod.MHJ
