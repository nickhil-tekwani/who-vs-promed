Mexico has started to vaccinate 10 million chickens and hens in the central west state of Jalisco against the bird flu virus, El Universal newspaper reported.

According to GlobalPost, some 5 million birds have been slaughtered so far as authorities race to contain the outbreak of the highly-contagious H7N3 virus, which has cost the Mexican poultry industry some USD 50 million since it was 1st detected on 20 Jun 2012.

"Starting tomorrow [26 Jul 2012], we are going to vaccinate hens and chicks across the country to put an end to this bird flu epidemic," Mexican President Felipe Calderon said on Wed 25 Jul 2012. The Mexican government declared a national animal emergency earlier this month [July 2012].

According to Agence France-Presse, President Calderon said Mexico aims to produce 80 million vaccinations so that "in the coming weeks, (we) can end this economic impact on poultry producers." Several laboratories have been tasked with making the vaccines.

Previous local media reports said bird flu had been detected at 33 of the 253 poultry farms in Jalisco inspected by the country's food safety watchdog, Senasica.

Senasica declared 82 farms to be free of the disease, while 138 have been kept under "strict surveillance."

Such outbreaks are monitored closely in Mexico since H1N1 began there in 2009 before spreading around the world and killing 17 000 people.

According to the UN, the H7N3 virus has occasionally caused human disease but has not shown itself to be easily transmittable between humans.

[Follow-up report No. 5 on its H7N3 outbreak was submitted by Mexico to the OIE on 25 Jul 2012, available -- with an interactive map -- at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=12147.

It includes the following epidemiological comments:

"As part of the surveillance activities and the epidemiological investigation carried out in response to the event, the National Food Quality, Food Safety and Health Service (SENASICA) continues the epidemiological sampling in the focal, perifocal and buffer zones. So far, 363 production units have been sampled. A total of 32 108 samples have been obtained, and 35 H7N3 viral isolates have been identified in poultry farms. The population at risk in these 363 production units amounts to about 17 million birds, of which 56.2 percent are of commercial layer farms, 29.2 percent of broilers, 7.44 percent of backyard poultry, and 7.16 percent of breeders.

The focal, perifocal and buffer zones still represent a total surface area of around 22 000 square km. During the depopulation activities in the poultry farms, around 3.8 million birds have been slaughtered and destroyed out of an affected 10.2 million bird population. Planned depopulation activities will continue. Control measures on the movement of birds, their products and by-products are still in place in the quarantine area.

Epidemiological surveillance activities continue in the focal, perifocal and buffer zones and a screening at the national level started in poultry and backyard farms. It includes around 17 000 serological and virological samples which will be processed in the official laboratories and will allow the maintenance of adequate supervision of the outbreak for its eradication. Current epidemiological parameters indicate an incidence rate of 24.58 percent, a mortality of 9.64 percent, and a fatality of 39.2 percent. As part of the measures to control and eradicate the virus, a temporary vaccine programme of birds at risk will be implemented through the production and application of an emulsified vaccine manufactured in Mexico by the official sector. Poultry farms in which the temporary vaccination would be authorized [and] prior risk assessment should eliminate the vaccinated birds at the end of their productive life." - Mod.AS
