The following is a press release (dated 15 October 1997) from the UK Health
and Safety Executive issued after consideration of the recent research
which indicated that mice infected with brain material from nvCJD patients
exhibit patterns of disease that are apparently the same as those caused by
BSE and different from normal CJD.

15 October 1997
HSE ADVISES THAT BSE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A BIOLOGICAL AGENT FOLLOWING
RESEARCH LINK WITH NEW VARIANT CJD
In the light of new research strengthening the link between BSE and new
variant CJD (nvCJD), BSE must now be considered a biological agent (human
pathogen) within the meaning of the Control of Substances Hazardous to
Health (COSHH) Regulations 1994.
The Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) has drawn this
conclusion after recent research showed that mice infected with brain
material from nvCJD patients exhibit patterns of disease - incubation
period and brain lesions - that are apparently the same as those caused by
BSE and different from normal CJD.
The ACDP believe that this, taken with other experimental data since March
1996, provides compelling evidence that nvCJD and BSE are caused by the
same infectious agent and advise that in view of the severity of nvCJD, the
BSE agent should be placed in the same hazard group (3 with derogation) as
the agent responsible for CJD.
BSE has yet to be formally added in the EC classification list under the
Biological Agents Directive 90/679/EEC, but in the meantime, COSHH Schedule
9 requires that employers make their own classification of any agent that
is not listed in the Approved List of Biological Agents or the ACDP
publication "Categorisation of biological agents according to hazard and
categories of containment."
To date there have been no confirmed cases of occupational transmission of
either BSE or CJD and none of the cases of nvCJD has any obvious link with
occupational exposure to BSE. Cases of classic CJD have been diagnosed in
a range of different occupations but there remains no evidence that these
are linked to occupational exposure to BSE or CJD.

The ACDP's advice and recommended worker safety measures have always been
precautionary in the light of the uncertainty about the risks from BSE.
Occupations that do not intentionally work with BSE, e.g., abattoir
workers, vets, should continue to follow the advice given since 1990 and
updated most recently in ACDP general guidance on BSE published in August
1996. Farmers can get specific advice in Agricultural Information Sheet no
19 "Occupational health risks from Cattle".
Those intentionally working with BSE infected material or preparations such
as laboratory researchers should use the same laboratory safety precautions
as for CJD. Advice on these can be found in the 1992 publication
"Precautions for work with human and animal Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathies" or in the Categorisation guidance. The 1992 guidance is
being revised and updated and will be published early in 1998.
