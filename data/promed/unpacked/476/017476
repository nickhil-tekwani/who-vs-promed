Yesterday, the government issued a health alert regarding fish being caught
using poison in Lake Victoria. The alert issued by the Director of Medical
Services, Prof. Julius Meme, says the fish could kill the consumer. Other
effects one could suffer from eating the fish include diarrhea, vomiting,
excessive sweating, abnormal salivation and symptoms like pneumonia, he
said.
Customers were warned to beware of fish which smelled foul and changed its
color to green within four to six hours of catching. It could be
contaminated, he warned.
Prof. Meme said patrols along the lake had been intensified and several
people had been arrested on suspicion of using poison to catch the fish.
Fish species likely to be affected include tilapia, Nile perch and omena.
Nearly 90 percent of fish harvested in Kenya is caught in the Lake Victoria,
a government's economic survey for last year indicates. In 1997, 164 000
tons of fish were landed from the lake, in a national harvest of 179 000
tons.
Prof. Meme announced the following measures to protect the public:
1)The Government Chemist Department is to reinforce the Kenya Marine
Research and Fisheries Institute in monitoring pesticides in the lake and in
fish;
2)health education campaigns have been mounted to make people aware of the
dangers of eating unwholesome fish;
3)increased patrols by public health officers, fisheries officials and
provincial administration officers along the lake to stamp out the poisoning
practice;
4)all fish from the lake to be thoroughly screened, including inspection and
chemical sampling on landing beaches and in fish processing firms before it
is released for sale.
The government called for cooperation among stakeholders in the fish
industry to safeguard public health.
The government also warned that fish imported from neighboring countries
sharing the lake were not safe. Fish businesses in Uganda were expected to
send a delegation to assure members of the European Union they had taken
measures to guarantee the quality of fish they export. The Ugandan Ministry
of Health said it had established fishermen were using pesticides and
herbal drugs to kill the fish.
Prof. Meme had earlier issued another statement suspending the consumption
and sale of fish from the lake, citing danger to public health. He later
scaled down his action to a health alert, following a meeting with the civil
service head Fares Kuindwa. He had invoked parts two and three of the Food,
Drugs and Chemical Substances Act which empowers public health officers to
intervene and stop the sale and consumption of food judged unsafe for human
consumption.
Fish vendors interviewed said they had not received the government alert on
poisoned fish.
***
(The fish consumed from the Indian Ocean is safe since the poison is used in
shallow waters. I have gotten in touch with several doctors around the lakes
on the Kenyan side, they have not seen any cases of poisoning. They have
promised to keep me posted. I will pass the information to ProMED-mail).
