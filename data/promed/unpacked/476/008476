England: norovirus outbreak at holiday village on the Isle of Wight
-------------------------------------------------------------------
About 100 pensioners from Shropshire who were heading to the Isle of Wight
by coach were forced to turn around and return home after a contagious
virus swept through the holiday village where they were due to be staying.
They set off for the Isle of Wight at about 0700 yesterday but the coaches
pulled over in Berkshire to make an emergency announcement. A
representative from the Coach Holiday Warehouse in Cheltenham, which had
organised the holiday, drove to the service station and told passengers the
bad news.

They were told that [a norovirus infection] had swept through Harcourt
Sands and 18 per cent of people who had stayed at the complex over the
weekend had come down with it. Mike Merron, managing director of the Coach
Holiday Warehouse, said all of the pensioners would be offered a full
refund. A spokesman from Harcourt Sands said they had been notifying coach
companies of the virus and advising them that it was their decision if they
wanted to continue with the holiday.

Ireland: suspected norovirus outbreak halts admissions at Waterford hospital
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
St Patrick's Hospital in Waterford has been closed to visitors and
admissions because of a suspected outbreak of the winter vomiting bug [a
norovirus infection]. Sixteen patients and a similar number of staff have
reported symptoms of the virus infection. The Board has asked the public
not to visit the hospital, except in exceptional circumstances, in a bid to
curb the spread of the virus infection.

Iowa: gastroenteritis outbreak affects schoolchildren in Alta
-------------------------------------------------------------
Buena Vista County Public Health Department is investigating an outbreak of
an unknown illness first reported in the county last Thu 6 May 2004. By Mon
10 May, some 40 cases had been reported, and an increasing number of people
were seeking help for an illness with vomiting, diarrhea and stomach ache.

"The first cases seemed to come from the lower elementary-school-age
children in Alta, and most of what we have seen so far is limited to Alta,"
said Diane Anderson of Buena Vista County Public Health. "We don't know
whether it originally came from some foodborne [source], or possibly some
kind of bacteria or viral [infection]. We started an investigation, and
have samples in to the University Hygienics Lab in Iowa City, but we
haven't yet heard an answer for what we have here."

Those with the illness are being encouraged to take a lot of fluids and
rest, and so far, those who have been ill seem to be recovering within a
few days. The public health department is not treating it with antibiotics,
at least not until they have positively identified the source of the sickness.

Iowa: norovirus confirmed cause of gastroenteritis outbreak in Alta
-------------------------------------------------------------------
STORM LAKE: Norovirus infection is responsible [for the outbreak of
gastroenteritis affecting] at least 40 people in Buena Vista County. Health
officials say the illness was first reported last week in Alta, about 10
miles west of Storm Lake. No one was admitted to hospital, and officials
believe the outbreak has tapered off. Health officials stated that the
virus is often transmitted by food workers who don't wash their hands.
