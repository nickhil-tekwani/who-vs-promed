Belgians are wondering how much poison they have eaten, after the discovery
of high levels of dioxins in chickens and eggs last month led to the
destruction of thousands of tons of food. New analyses now show that
affected food contained high levels of PCBs as well, and that most of the
contamination has probably already been eaten. It is not yet clear how many
people will be affected.
Chicken farmers noticed last January that eggs were not hatching, and
chicks had nervous disorders. Much of the delay in finding the cause was
due to the fact veterinarians first suspected other problems, especially
nutrient deficiencies. In April, with the cause still not found, a
consultant working for a feed manufacturer's insurance company thought of
dioxin contamination. He sent a laying hen, and suspect feed, to
RIKILT-DLO, the Dutch State Institute for Quality Control of Agricultural
Products in Wageningen, the nearest laboratory that could measure dioxins.
RIKILT found 781 picograms of dioxins per gram of fat in the feed, 1562
times the legal limit set by the EU only last year. The pattern of
congeners of dioxins and furans in the feed and the chicken matched, and
pointed to a source in PCBs, as they resembled the pattern observed after a
1968 incident in Japan in which PCBs leaked into rice oil, causing serious
human toxicity. Subsequent analysis indeed revealed high levels of PCB
contamination in the chicken.
The contamination was traced to one 80-ton batch of fat produced by the
Verkest rendering company near Ghent in January, which was sold to 12 feed
manufacturers. On the basis of concentrations found in the feed, the oil
would have contained 8 litres of pure PCB oil (such as Aroclors 1245 and
1260). One theory is that used transformer oil was mistakenly dumped in a
public recycling container for used frying oil.The fat sold to feed
companies was supposed to be pure animal fat, but RIKILT found it also
contained vegetable oils.
The batch would have made 1600 tons, or 16 million chicken-days, of feed.
It also got into pig and cattle fodder. Human toxicity will depend on how
many animals ate it, and passed the toxins on in meat or eggs. Either a few
people got a large dose, or many people got a small dose. Recently produced
meat and eggs so far tested are clean. So far only two chickens and two
eggs from April and May have been analysed. The chickens contained 958 and
775 picograms of dioxins per gram of fat, and one had 400 micrograms total
PCBs per gram of fat, 400 times the Dutch limit for food. Given the average
Belgian diet, if all eggs and chicken in the affected area had 900
picograms of dioxins per gram of fat, people got forty times the WHO's
recommended daily limit of a picogram per kilogram of body weight per day
for as long as the contamination persisted at that level. Counting certain
PCBs that resemble dioxins as well, toxic limits could have been exceeded a
hundred-fold.
Most people carry 2 to 6 nanograms per kilogram of body weight of dioxins
already. One egg with 900 picograms of dioxins per gram of fat adds six
nanograms to that load -- an increase of as little as 1.4 per cent for an
adult, but as much as 20 per cent for a child. Ten years ago people had
twice the current body burden of dioxins.
Scientists suspect the doses Belgians got are too low to cause cancer, but
could affect neural and cognitive development, the immune system, and
thyroid and steroid hormones, especially in unborn and young children. They
are urging Belgian authorities to do extensive sampling and analysis of
food produced during the period of contamination, to assess more exactly
what human dosages may have been, and to undertake medical surveillance of
people at risk, especially newborns and young children. But the capacity of
analytical laboratories in the region to perform the analyses is already
stretched to the limit.
