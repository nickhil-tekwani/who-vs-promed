Health officials in Hawaii have reported a variant H3N2 (H3N2v) infection in a child younger than 18, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today [Fri 31 Jul 2020] in its weekly flu update. The patient was not hospitalized and has recovered.

In the past, H3N2v cases have been linked to swine exposure at agricultural fairs in the summer, but so far, no exposure to swine has been reported in Hawaii's patient, and an investigation into the source is under way.

The CDC said the H3N2v case is the 1st to be reported in the United States since 2018. A large H3N2v outbreak occurred in 2011 and 2012 in the United States, mostly in children exposed to pigs.

2019-2020 Influenza Season Week 30 (w/e 25 Jul 2020)
----------------------------------------------------
One human infection with a novel influenza A virus was reported by Hawaii. This person was infected with an influenza A(H3N2) variant (A(H3N2)v) virus. The patient is a child under 18 years of age, was not hospitalized, and has recovered from their illness. While no exposure to swine has been reported to date, an investigation is ongoing into the source of the patient's infection. This is the 1st influenza A(H3N2)v virus infection detected in the United States since 2018.

Influenza viruses that circulate in swine are called swine influenza viruses when isolated from swine, but are called variant viruses when isolated from humans. Seasonal influenza viruses that circulate worldwide in the human population have important antigenic and genetic differences from influenza viruses that circulate in swine.

Early identification and investigation of human infections with novel influenza A viruses are critical so that the risk of infection can be more fully understood and appropriate public health measures can be taken. Additional information on influenza in swine, variant influenza infection in humans, and strategies to interact safely with swine can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/index.htm.

[Influenza viruses commonly circulate in pigs. From time to time, one of these viruses can be transmitted from a pig to a human. In these cases, it is referred to as a variant influenza virus infection. This most commonly happens when people have extended close contact with pigs.

Symptoms of variant H3N2 influenza in people are similar to the seasonal flu and can include fever, cough, runny nose, and sometimes body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Sometimes H3N2 influenza causes severe disease even in healthy people, such as pneumonia which may require hospitalization, and even death. Those at higher risk of developing complications if they get H3N2 influenza include children under 5 years of age, people 65 years of age and over, pregnant women, and people with certain chronic health disease, such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, and neurological conditions.

To date, 431 human cases of A/Influenza H3N2v have been reported from the United States since 2012 https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/Novel_Influenza.html. - Mod.UBA
