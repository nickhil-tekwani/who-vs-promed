Unknown disease in South Africa identified as arenavirus infection
------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
---------------
On 12 Sep 2008, a tourist guide organising safari
trips, residing in Lusaka, Zambia, was evacuated
in a critical condition to Johannesburg, South
Africa. She was admitted to a clinic where she
died on 14 Sep 2008 about 10 days after the onset
of symptoms. The symptoms included a prodromal
phase with fever, myalgia, vomiting, diarrhoea,
followed by rash, liver dysfunction and
convulsions [1]. Cerebral oedema was detected on
scan examination. No laboratory specimen was available for investigation.

The paramedic who had cared for the index case
during her evacuation to Johannesburg developed
prodromal symptoms similar to the index case. He
was hospitalised on 27 Sep 2008. His condition
deteriorated and he died on 2 Oct 2008. An
intensive care unit nurse who cared for the index
case in Johannesburg developed similar flu-like
symptoms and was hospitalised on 1 Oct 2008. Her
condition deteriorated on 4 Oct 2008 and she died
on 5 Oct 2008 of acute respiratory distress
syndrome. In both cases, the incubation period is
estimated to have been about one week. On 13 Oct
2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) posted
a Web site update informing about a 4th case
affecting a nurse who had been in contact with the paramedic [2].

On 12 Oct 2008, the National Institute for
Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa
provided preliminary evidence that the causative
agent of the disease was a virus from the family
_ Arenaviridae_ [3]. Specimens were shipped to
the United States Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta for additional investigations.

Arenavirus taxonomy
------------------------
Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses (about 120 nm
diameter) with a bi-segmented negative strand RNA
genome. The typical image in electronic
microscopy showing grainy ribosomal particles
("arena" in Latin) inside the virions gave the
name to this family of viruses. The prototype is
Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis virus (LCMV),
isolated in 1933 in North America from a human
case with aseptic meningitis. Cases caused by
LCMV occur worldwide. Other arenaviruses causing
hemorrhagic fevers were reported in South
America, causing sporadic cases or limited
outbreaks: Junin virus in 1958 in Argentina,
Machupo virus in 1963 in Bolivia, Guanarito virus
in 1990-1991 in Venezuela, Sabia virus in 1990 in
Brazil and more recently Chapare virus in 2004 in
Bolivia [4]. In West Africa, Lassa virus was
identified in Nigeria in 1969. It causes
thousands of cases each year in Sierra Leone,
Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria. However, only
limited data are available to assess the real
incidence of Lassa fever in Africa.

Clinical symptoms of arenavirus infections, treatment and vaccine
-----------------------------------------------------------------
2 types of clinical presentations are described:
neurological and haemorrhagic fever. However,
asymptomatic arenavirus infection may be
frequent. The incubation period is about 10 days
(3-21 days). LCMV causes aseptic meningitis or
meningoencephalitis with an overall case fatality
<1 percent. Foetal infections can result in
congenital abnormalities or death. Transmission
of arenaviruses via organ transplantation has
been documented; immunosuppressed recipient
patients can develop fatal haemorrhagic
fever-like disease [5,6]. The Lassa viral
haemorrhagic fever usually presents as a
non-specific illness with symptoms including
fever, headache, dizziness, asthenia, sore
throat, pharyngitis, cough, retrosternal and
abdominal pain, and vomiting. In severe forms,
facial oedema is associated with haemorrhagic
conjunctivitis, moderate bleeding (from nose,
gums, vagina, etc.) and exanthema. Neurological
signs may develop and progress to confusion,
convulsion, coma and death. Severe prognosis is
associated with a high viraemia, elevated
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) liver enzymes,
bleeding, encephalitis and oedema. There is a
very high risk of foetal mortality in pregnant
women during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Case
fatality rates range from 5 to 20 percent for
hospitalised cases. Clinical symptoms of
infection by arenaviruses in South America are
similar to those described for Lassa fever in Africa.

Ribavirin has been shown to be an effective
treatment for Lassa fever, especially when
started within the first 6 days of illness [7,8].
There is currently no vaccine for Lassa fever but
several candidates are under development studies
with successful trials in primates [9]. One
available vaccine is licensed in Argentina for Junin virus.

Reservoir of arenavirus and transmission
----------------------------------------
Arenaviruses are associated with rodents, their
natural hosts. Some of these viruses can be
transmitted to humans by contact with faeces,
urine, blood or saliva of infected rodents or
with dust containing infective particles. In
South America, Machupo and Junin viruses were
identified in _Calomys_ sp. rodent, and Guanarito
virus was found in a Sigmodon cotton rat [10]. In
West Africa, _Mastomys natalensis_ (a
peridomestic rodent) is the reservoir of Lassa
virus. Its geographic distribution is much wider
in sub-Saharan Africa that the presently known
area of Lassa transmission [11]. Other
arenaviruses such as Mopeia virus in Mozambique
had been isolated from rodents without evidence of disease in humans [10].

Fatal nosocomial and laboratory infections by
arenaviruses have been reported. Contamination
occurs via direct contact with body fluids or via
droplets. Since the 1970s special procedures for
handling these viruses (now categorised as class
4 agents) have been put in place, including the
building of dedicated biosafety laboratories
(BSL-4), with containment equipment for all
activities involving the virus, infectious or
potentially infectious body fluids or tissues.

Conclusion
----------
In the cluster reported here, 4 cases have been
identified including an index case and 3 cases of
subsequent nosocomial transmission among health
workers. The clinical presentation was consistent
with neurological symptoms of arenavirus
infection. As the incubation period for
arenaviruses is up to 3 weeks, secondary cases
may still be identified as part of the follow-up
of contacts established in response to this event.

The professional activities of the index case
could have favoured possible exposure to rodent
excreta in a rural area. This is the 1st
identification of an arenavirus causing human
disease in a southern African country. Further
laboratory investigation will allow
characterisation of the virus associated with
this outbreak and its relation with the existing
Lassa virus present in West Africa. Since 1969,
at least 24 cases of Lassa fever are known to
have been exported outside Africa, including 16
cases imported to Europe [12,13]. However, in
none of these cases has secondary transmission
resulted in a symptomatic disease.

[This is a comprehensive account of the outbreak
of a novel arenavirus infection in Southern
Africa. Some confusion remains concerning the
location of exposure of the index case and the
existence of a clinical sample from the index case.

With regard to the taxonomy of the arenaviruses
it should be noted that the Old World
arenaviruses (LCMV and the African viruses) are
phylogenetically distinct from the New World
arenaviruses. While similarities exist in genomic
organization, structure and clinical disease
caused by pathogenic Old World and New World
arenaviruses these pathogens use different
primary receptors. The Old World arenaviruses
employ alpha-dystroglycan, a cellular receptor
for proteins of the extracellular matrix, and the
human pathogenic New World arenaviruses use the
cellular cargo receptor transferrin receptor 1.

While the New World arenavirus Junin virus enters
cells via clathrin-dependent endocytosis,
evidence occurred for clathrin- independent entry
of the prototypic Old World arenavirus
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Upon
internalization, arenaviruses are delivered to
the endosome, where pH-dependent membrane fusion
is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein (GP).
While arenavirus GPs share characteristics with
class I fusion GPs of other enveloped viruses,
unusual mechanistic features of GP-mediated
membrane fusion have recently been discovered for
arenaviruses with important implications for
viral entry (see: Cell entry by human pathogenic
arenaviruses. Rojek JM, Kunz S. Cell Microbiol.
2008 Apr;10(4): 828-35. Epub 2007 Dec 21). - Mod.CP]
