New York Autopsies Show 2009 H1N1 Influenza Virus Damages Entire Airway
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In fatal cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza, the virus can
damage cells throughout the respiratory airway, much like the viruses
that caused the 1918 and 1957 influenza pandemics, report researchers
from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the New York City
Office of Chief Medical Examiner. The scientists reviewed autopsy
reports, hospital records and other clinical data from 34 people who
died of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus infection between 15 May
15 and 9 Jul 2009. All but 2 of the deaths occurred in New York City.
A microscopic examination of tissues throughout the airways revealed
that the virus caused damage primarily to the upper airway -- the
trachea and bronchial tubes -- but tissue damage in the lower airway,
including deep in the lungs, was present as well. Evidence of
secondary bacterial infection was seen in more than half of the victims.

The team was led by James R. Gill, M.D., of the New York City Office
of Chief Medical Examiner and New York University School of Medicine,
and Jeffery K. Taubenberger, M.D., Ph.D., of the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at NIH. The findings are
reported in the Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, now
available online and scheduled to appear in the February 2010 print issue.

"This study provides clinicians with a clear and detailed picture of
the disease caused by the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus that
will help inform patient management," says NIAID Director Anthony S.
Fauci, M.D. "In fatal cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza, it
appears the novel pandemic influenza virus produces pulmonary damage
that looks very much like that seen in earlier influenza pandemics."

The new report also underscores the impact 2009 H1N1 influenza is
having on younger people. While most deaths from seasonal influenza
occur in adults over 65 years old, deaths from 2009 H1N1 influenza
occur predominately among younger people. The majority of deaths (62
percent) in the 34 cases studied were among those 25 to 49 years old;
2 infants were also among the fatal cases.

Ninety-one percent of those autopsied had underlying medical
conditions, such as heart disease or respiratory disease, including
asthma, before becoming ill with 2009 H1N1 influenza. Of the adults
and adolescents who died, 72 percent were obese. This finding agrees
with earlier reports, based on hospital records, linking obesity with
an increased risk of death from 2009 H1N1 influenza.

The researchers examined tissue samples from the 34 deceased
individuals to assess how the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus
damaged various parts of the respiratory system. "We saw a spectrum
of damage to tissue in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts,"
says Dr. Taubenberger. In all cases, the uppermost regions of the
respiratory tract -- the trachea and bronchial tube -- were inflamed,
with severe damage in some cases. In 18 cases, evidence of damage
lower down in the finer branches of the bronchial tubes, or
bronchioles, was noted. In 25 cases, the researchers found damage to
the small globular air sacs, or alveoli, of the lungs. "This pattern
of pathology in the airway tissues is similar to that reported in
autopsy findings of victims of both the 1918 and 1957 influenza
pandemics," notes Dr. Taubenberger.

The researchers also examined 33 of the 34 cases for evidence of
pulmonary bacterial infections. Of these cases, 18 (55 percent) were
positive for such infections. Not all of those individuals who had
bacterial pneumonia along with 2009 H1N1 virus infection had been
hospitalized, however, indicating that some had acquired their
bacterial infections outside of a health-care setting. This raises
the possibility, say the authors, that community-acquired bacterial
pneumonia is playing a role in the current pandemic. "Even in an era
of widespread and early antibiotic use," write the authors,
"bacterial pneumonia remains an important factor for severe or fatal
influenza."

Computerized tomography (CT) lung images were available in 4 cases of
pulmonary bacterial infection. In all 4 cases, the CT scans showed an
abnormality known as ground-glass opacity, which are patches of
rounded haze not seen in normal lung images. It is not known, say the
researchers, whether the abnormalities detected by CT in the 4 cases
also occur in people who have milder H1N1 infections. They call for
additional investigation into the utility of CT scans as a tool to
help clinicians identify and better treat severe H1N1 infections.

[2] Blood transfusion

A comment re: PRO/AH/EDR> Influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (122):
convalescent serum
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It might interest the moderators [and readers] that it was observed
during the 1918 pandemic that soldiers that received blood
transfusions had approximately 50 percent lower mortality from H1N1 influenza.

China has reported in the past about the effectiveness of
treating H5N1 avian influenza patients with convalescent serum. Your
comment on the dangers of blood products may be valid, but condescending.

Survival of pregnant women affected by influenza is reported to be
enhanced by administration of immune globulin.

We should be so lucky to have researchers examining the potential of
this practice here in the U.S.

[My presumption was that this is a question of relative risk. Whereas
the preparation and transfusion of immunoglobulin carries little
risk, that may not be the case in transfusion of convalescent blood.
However, my knowledge of current procedures is limited and my comment
may have been ill-judged. - Mod.CP]
