Pandemic flu vaccination linked to narcolepsy in UK children
------------------------------------------------------------
Health Protection Agency (HPA) scientists have found evidence of an association between Pandemrix flu vaccination and narcolepsy in children in England, according to the findings of a study published in the British Medical Journal [Miller et al: Risk of narcolepsy in children and young people receiving an AS03 adjuvanted pandemic AH1N1 (2009) influenza vaccine: retrospective analysis. (2013). BMJ 2013; 346: f794; http://www.bmj.com/cgi/doi/10.1136/bmj.f794]. These findings are consistent with previous studies from Finland and Sweden which identified a similar association.

In collaboration with researchers from Papworth and Addenbrooke's hospitals in Cambridge, the study looked at 75 children aged between 4 and 18 who were diagnosed with narcolepsy from January 2008 and who attended sleep centres across England. 11 of these children had been vaccinated with Pandemrix before their symptoms began, 7 of these within 6 months. This suggests a risk of narcolepsy following vaccination with Pandemrix of around one in every 55 000 doses of the vaccine.

The Pandemrix vaccine was recommended for use in children at risk of serious complications from influenza during the pandemic flu outbreak in 2009/10. It was also used occasionally in children during the 2010/11 flu season. Since July 2011 the use of Pandemrix in people under the age of 20 across Europe has been restricted.

Although prior to this study, there was no evidence to suggest an association in the UK, on the basis of the findings from Finland the HPA launched an in depth study in February 2011 with narcolepsy experts across England. This investigated whether there was evidence of an association between narcolepsy and Pandemrix as used in the UK.

Lead author Professor Liz Miller, a consultant epidemiologist with the HPA, said: "These findings suggest there is an increased risk in children of narcolepsy after Pandemrix vaccination and this is consistent with findings from studies in other European countries. However, this risk may be overestimated by more rapid referral of vaccinated cases. Long term follow up of people exposed to Pandemrix is needed before we can fully establish the extent of the association.

"Our findings have implications for the future licensing and use of adjuvanted pandemic vaccines. Further studies to assess the possible risk associated with other vaccines used in the pandemic, including those with and without adjuvants, are also needed to inform the use of such vaccines in the event of a future pandemic."

Study co-author Dr John Shneerson, consultant physician from the Respiratory Support and Sleep Centre at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, said: "Narcolepsy is thought to be due to a loss of function of a small group of cells in one of the sleep centres in the brain, as a result of an abnormal reaction of the body's immune system. Pandemrix may have triggered an immune reaction against the sleep centre cells in those children who were genetically predisposed to develop narcolepsy. This study has been important in helping to shed light on the mechanism of how narcolepsy can develop."

Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder caused by the brain's inability to control sleep, particularly REM (dream) sleep. It leads to excessive daytime sleepiness usually accompanied by sudden episodes of muscle weakness triggered by strong emotions such as laughter -- this is known as cataplexy. Narcolepsy has a genetic component but this has to be triggered by other factors in order for the condition to appear. 20 000 people in the UK are through to have narcolepsy --drug treatment and lifestyle measures are usually effective in relieving the symptoms.

[The BMJ paper sates that: "Case notes for 245 children and young people were reviewed; 75 had narcolepsy (56 with cataplexy) and onset after 1 Jan 2008. 11 had been vaccinated before onset; 7 within 6 months. In those with a diagnosis by July 2011 the odds ratio was 14.4 (95 percent confidence interval 4.3 to 48.5) for vaccination at any time before onset and 16.2 (3.1 to 84.5) for vaccination within 6 months before onset. The relative incidence from the self controlled cases series analysis in those with a diagnosis by July 2011 with onset from October 2008 to December 2010 was 9.9 (2.1 to 47.9). The attributable risk was estimated as between 1 in 57 500 and 1 in 52 000 doses." It was concluded that, "the increased risk of narcolepsy after vaccination with AS03 adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 2009 vaccine indicates a causal association, consistent with findings from Finland. Because of variable delay in diagnosis, however, the risk might be overestimated by more rapid referral of vaccinated children."

The CDC has issued a statement on narcolepsy following Pandemrix influenza vaccination experience in Europe (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/h1n1_narcolepsy_pandemrix.html). An increased risk of narcolepsy was found following vaccination with Pandemrix, a monovalent 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine that was used in several European countries during the H1N1 influenza pandemic. Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder caused by the brain's inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally. This risk was initially found in Finland, and then some other European countries also detected an association. Most recently, scientists at the United Kingdom's (UK) Health Protection Agency (HPA) have found evidence of an association between Pandemrix and narcolepsy in children in England. The findings are consistent with studies from Finland and other countries.

Pandemrix is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline in Europe and was specifically produced for pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza [A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection]. It was not used before 2009, and has not been used since the influenza pandemic season (2009-2010). It contains an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant called AS03. Adjuvants are substances added to a vaccine to increase the body's immune response to that vaccine.

Pandemrix was not licensed for use in the United States. In fact, no adjuvanted influenza vaccines are licensed in the United States, and no adjuvanted influenza vaccines were used in the United States during the influenza pandemic or in any other influenza season.

In response to the events in Europe, CDC reviewed data from the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) and to date have found no indication of any association between US-licensed H1N1 or seasonal influenza vaccine and narcolepsy.

CDC is currently sponsoring an international study on the associations between adjuvanted monovalent 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines and narcolepsy. That study is expected to be completed in 2014.

CDC recommends influenza vaccination as the best way to protect from influenza disease and its complications. CDC recommendations for influenza vaccine during the 2012-2013 season can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6132a3.htm. - Mod.CP]
