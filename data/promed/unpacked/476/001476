[In August 2021, Mongolia reported 2 outbreaks of peste des petits ruminants in domestic animals (sheep and goats). The event was declared resolved in October 2021. See the final report at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=50150.

The following abstract comes from an article by Benfield et al.:

"Abstract
--------
Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes disease in domestic and wild ungulates, is the target of a global eradication programme, and threatens biodiversity. Understanding the epidemiology and evolution of PPRV in wildlife is important but hampered by the paucity of wildlife-origin PPRV genomes. In this study, full PPRV genomes were generated from 3 Mongolian saiga antelope, one Siberian ibex, and one goitered gazelle from the 2016-2017 PPRV outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis showed that for Mongolian and Chinese PPRV since 2013, the wildlife and livestock-origin genomes were closely related and interspersed. There was strong phylogenetic support for a monophyletic group of PPRV from Mongolian wildlife and livestock, belonging to a clade of lineage IV PPRV from livestock and wildlife from China since 2013. Discrete diffusion analysis found strong support for PPRV spread into Mongolia from China, and phylogeographic analysis indicated Xinjiang Province as the most likely origin, although genomic surveillance for PPRV is poor and lack of sampling from other regions could bias this result. Times of most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) were June 2015 (95% highest posterior density (HPD): August 2014 to March 2016) for all Mongolian PPRV genomes and May 2016 (95% HPD: October 2015 to October 2016) for Mongolian wildlife-origin PPRV. This suggests that PPRV was circulating undetected in Mongolia for at least 6 months before the 1st reported outbreak in August 2016 and that wildlife were likely infected before livestock vaccination began in October 2016. Finally, genetic variation and positively selected sites were identified that might be related to PPRV emergence in Mongolian wildlife. This study is the 1st to sequence multiple PPRV genomes from a wildlife outbreak, across several host species. Additional full PPRV genomes and associated metadata from the livestock-wildlife interface is needed to enhance the power of molecular epidemiology, support PPRV eradication, and safeguard the health of the whole ungulate community." - Mod.CRD
