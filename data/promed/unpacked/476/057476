Florida Anthrax Victim Dies
----------------------------------
Lantana, FL, Oct 5: A 63-year-old Florida man died today after contracting
the inhaled form of anthrax, an extremely rare and lethal disease that
could be a weapon in the hands of terrorists. [However investigators have
said there is no evidence he was the victim of a terrorist attack. Dr. Jean
Malecki said the man failed to respond to the antibiotics he had been given
and died at 4 p.m. the first anthrax death in the United States in a
quarter century. Dr. Larry Bush, an infectious disease specialist, said his
patient suffered kidney failure and then cardiac arrest and could not be
resuscitated. "It was not unexpected," Bush said.
Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, and Tim O'Conner, a spokesman for the Florida
Department of Health's Palm Beach County operation, both said today that no
other cases of anthrax have been reported. "[CDC investigators are not
looking at any pending cases," Reynolds said. "They have been scanning the
hospitals, but we don't have anything." O'Conner said several ill people
visited doctors and called public health clinics today, fearing they might
have anthrax. 3 people warranted additional tests, but all were negative.
"We have ruled them out," he said.
There has been concern because anthrax has been developed by some countries
as a possible biological weapon, though U.S. officials have said there was
no evidence the Florida case was the victim of terrorism.
The disease, which is not contagious can be contracted naturally, often
from livestock or soil [if you are a cow... MHJ, and the deceased man did
visit North Carolina last week. Officials said the deceased man was an avid
outdoorsman, and the CDC said today it is continuing to investigate where
he may have caught the disease. Only 18 inhalation cases in the United
States were documented in the 20th century, the most recent in 1976 in
California. The last anthrax death in Florida occurred in 1974, according
to the state health department.
Dr. Paul Nicoletti, a professor at the University of Florida's College of
Veterinary Medicine, said anthrax is not normally found among wildlife or
livestock in Florida. "There has not been a case here [among animals in
years," he said. He said anthrax occasionally appears among animals in
Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Arkansas, and parts of Midwest, though he
wasn't sure about North Carolina. "It will be interesting to see where this
came from," he said.
FBI, CDC and state health and agriculture investigators sealed off the
deceased man's house and searched it for about 2 hours today. When they
left, they removed the yellow crime scene tape they had placed around the
house. They were also searching his workplace.
FBI spokeswoman Judy Orihuela said that was routine procedure and it does
not indicate any belief by agents that the anthrax was released by
terrorists. Dr. Steven Wiersma, a state epidemiologist, said investigators
took a number of items from the man's home, including pesticide sprays and
fertilizer bottles, to see if they were contaminated. "We don't expect any
of these to turn out positive, but those are prudent to check," he said.
Some in Lantana have been concerned because Mohamed Atta, one of the
suspected hijackers who crashed airliners into the World Trade Center on 11
Sep 2001, rented planes at a flight school at Palm Beach County Park
Airport. The home of the deceased man is within a mile of the airport.
Shortly after the terrorist attack, Marian Smith, owner of Palm Beach
Flight Training, said Atta had rented a plane four times in August.
Employees at the flight school declined comment today. Atta also visited an
airfield in Belle Glade, about 40 miles inland from Lantana, and asked
workers there questions about their cropdusters, but never flew one. Some
of the suspected hijackers had lived in an apartment complex in Boynton
Beach, about 10 miles south of Lantana.
"I'm starting to get a little scared," said Louis Selitti Jr., 33, who
lives across the street from the home of the deceased man in a neighborhood
of modest, single-story homes. "To get something in our lungs, you have to
breathe it in. Hopefully it wasn't around here."
Orihuela said agents have not revisited the airport or the apartment
complex since the Florida man became ill, and she was not aware of any
plans to do so. She said the agency is monitoring the CDC's investigation,
"but they're in charge."
Eric Croddy, a bioterrorism expert at California's Monterey Institute, said
that everything so far leads him to believe that the government is right,
that the Florida man caught the disease naturally and that it is an
isolated case. "He's an unfortunate, unlucky fellow," Croddy said. He said
that there likely have been a small number of other cases of the disease
since the 1970s, but because the disease is so rare in this country it was
misdiagnosed. "But now every doctor knows of it and is looking for it," he said

It seems a little premature to me to call this pulmonary anthrax. That term
is generally reserved for anthrax acquired by inhaling the spores. I
understand this person had meningeal symptoms, which as you know can be a
sequel to any form of the disease. By the time he was being X-rayed, I
suspect he had generalized edema and this, in the chest region, may have
been regarded as pulmonary symptomatology. It will be interesting to see
what CDC can trace in the way of infection source and route. But for now my
suspicions are that it is not inhalation anthrax.
[ProMED-mail wishes to thank Dr. Turnbull, truly one of the world's leading
authorities on anthrax, for his comments. - Man. Ed. DS

[But if it was not primarily pneumonic, which itself sets up problems of
how did he get it, what was the primary lesion the meningitis infection
followed? So far there are no reports of any other lesions. I suppose if he
sniffed hard at some contaminated wool or picked his nose after handling
some contaminated Haitian goat skins, for example, it would go almost
straight to the brain via a lesion in his nasal turbinates, and if no one
has looked up his nasal passages, any lesion there would be missed. Also
drainage from a primary nasal lesion would be into the trachea and lungs.
The autopsy will reveal more information.
Otherwise, the only other relevant information I have from various sources
is that he had an obvious positive blood culture at the time of his
positive lumbar tap on Tuesday. The organism was sensitive to 4 common
antibiotics tested, including penicillin and ciprofloxacin. The careful
initial positive identification was confirmed by CDC. The patient's care
was certainly outstanding to have kept him going for so long. - Mod.MHJ
