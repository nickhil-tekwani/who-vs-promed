The state government is investigating an incident that sent 2 surfers to hospital after coming in contact with "a brown sludge-like substance" at a popular south-west Victorian surf spot.

The 2 male surfers went to hospitals in Warrnambool and Port Fairy over the Easter weekend [3-4 Apr 2021] and were awaiting test results to determine the cause of their illnesses, but both said they came in contact with brown water while surfing at The Passage near Port Fairy.

One surfer is understood to have been in the hospital on a drip for 4 days.

The Department of environment, land, water and planning (DELWP) has taken water samples at The Passage for analysis and will use drones to monitor the area.

The EPA [Environment Protection Authority] confirmed it had received reports of brown water in the ocean at Port Fairy during that period.

Local water authority Wannon Water says it hasn't had any issues with its local sewage treatment plant or associated outfall, which discharges treated water out to sea at Griffiths Island near The Passage.

DELWP is advising the public to avoid direct contact with water in and around The Passage until further notice.

Key points:
- 2 surfers were hospitalised after reportedly coming into contact with brown sludge in the water at a Port Fairy [Victoria] surf spot
- The state government is investigating the incident
- The local water authority has denied any issues with its sewage outfall near the surf spot

[While brown water makes us think of sewage, it can also be a variety of strains of harmful algae blooms. The algae blooms have not been proven, but it is suspicious. We are anxious to know the outcome of the mysterious brown water. And we wish the affected individuals well.

In the meantime I have provided more information regarding algal blooms from NOAA (US National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration; https://www.noaa.gov/what-is-harmful-algal-bloom):
"Harmful algal blooms, or HABs, occur when colonies of algae -- simple plants that live in the sea and freshwater -- grow out of control and produce toxic or harmful effects on people, fish, shellfish, marine mammals, and birds. The human illnesses caused by HABs, though rare, can be debilitating or even fatal.

"Ranging from microscopic, single-celled organisms to large seaweeds, algae are simple plants that form the base of food webs. Sometimes, however, their roles are more sinister. Under the right conditions, algae may grow out of control -- and a few of these "blooms" produce toxins that can kill fish, mammals, and birds, and may cause human illness or even death in extreme cases. Other algae are nontoxic, but eat up all of the oxygen in the water as they decay, clog the gills of fish and invertebrates, or smother corals and submerged aquatic vegetation. Still, others discolor water, form huge, smelly piles on beaches or contaminate drinking water. Collectively, these events are called harmful algal blooms, or HABs."

"These blooms are a concern because they affect not only the health of people and marine ecosystems but also the "health" of our economy -- especially coastal communities dependent on the income of jobs generated through fishing and tourism. With climate change and increasing nutrient pollution potentially causing HABs to occur more often and in locations not previously affected, it's important for us to learn as much as we can about how and why they form and where they are so that we can reduce their harmful effects.

"NOAA is on the forefront of HAB research to better understand how and why these blooms form and to improve detection and forecasting of these seasonal events. One of our top goals is to provide communities with advance warning so they can adequately plan for and deal with the adverse environmental, economic, and health effects associated with HABs."

Algal blooms come in many colors, depending upon the organism producing the bloom, the salinity, and temperature of the water. An internet search has photos of reds, greens, browns, and several colors of blooms all at the same time. There may be a difference in color depending on whether the water affected is fresh or salt, and what the salinity may be.

From Water Quality Australia (https://www.waterquality.gov.au/issues/blue-green-algae:
"Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are a type of microscopic, algae-like bacteria that inhabit freshwater, coastal, and marine waters.

"Cyanobacteria photosynthesise like plants and have similar requirements for sunlight, nutrients, and carbon dioxide to grow and produce oxygen. There are many different varieties of blue-green algae. While often a green or blue-green colour, they can also be white, brown, blue, yellow-brown, or red. The water may appear to have scum on it or it may appear as a sheen.

"If conditions are suitable, cyanobacteria can increase to excessive levels and form visible 'blooms'" which can adversely affect water quality. Poor water quality and the potential for toxicity mean that blue-green algae can cause environmental problems, disrupt drinking water supplies, recreational activities, and water-dependent industries, and pose a risk to livestock, wildlife, and human health.

Causes of blue-green algae blooms
Blue-green algae "can reproduce quickly in favourable conditions where there is abundant sunlight, still or slow-flowing water, and sufficient levels of nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus. In still conditions, surface water may form a separate warm top layer ('stratification') in which blue-green algae is able to access sunlight and nutrients. If these combined factors are present for several days, cyanobacteria multiply and form large 'blooms'." The process of excess nutrients causing rapid growth of aquatic plant and bacterial life in a water body is known as 'eutrophication'.

"Nutrients are either naturally present in sediments or are washed into water systems. In particular, phosphorus may be stored in significant amounts in sediments and released by normal bacterial activity. External sources of nitrogen and phosphorus are: agricultural fertilisers, household products, sewage effluent, and stormwater runoff, all of which can enter receiving waters either directly or during rainfall events. The availability of varying levels of nitrogen and phosphorus can affect which species of blue-green algae dominate and form blooms.

"Blooms can form in response to increased temperatures and phosphorus levels even if nitrogen in water remains low, as some blue-green algae species can obtain nitrogen from the atmosphere.

"Effects of a blue-green algae bloom
The main effects of blue-green algae blooms are deterioration of water quality and production of toxins by some species. Exposure to algal toxins has been linked to fatalities of livestock, wildlife, and pets.

"Decaying algae can reduce dissolved oxygen levels in the water column which can severely degrade aquatic ecosystems and lead to the death of aquatic organisms and, hence, a decline in biodiversity."

Outbreaks of blue-green algae may have economic consequences from restrictions to the consumptive use of water and recreational activities due to health and aesthetic concerns. Some species of blue-green algae can produce neurotoxins, hepatotoxins, allergens, or irritants to the skin and eyes, as well as compounds that affect the taste of water and produce unpleasant odours. "In severe cases, the toxins can cause damage to the liver and nervous system and there have been human deaths associated with non-routine exposure to algal toxins through dialysis."

"When a bloom is detected, alternative sources of water should be sought for human or animal consumption and domestic purposes until specialised treatment processes can be introduced." Boiling water does not destroy algal toxins and can, in fact, releases more toxins as the blue-green algae are killed. "Irrigators are usually advised to avoid using contaminated water on edible crops or, if this is not possible, to avoid direct spraying."

From PJXM News (https://pjxmnews.me/2016/08/05/advisory-blue-green-algae-bloom-found-on-charlie-lake/):
"Symptoms from drinking water that contain toxic algae can include: headaches, nausea, fever, sore throat, dizziness, stomach cramps, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, muscle aches, mouth ulcers, and blistering of the lips. Symptoms from swimming and other recreational water activities in contaminated water can include skin rashes and irritated ears and eyes." Unfortunately, swimmers may inadvertently swallow drops of the contaminated water.

"If you have been exposed to blue-green algae toxins and have any of these symptoms, rinse off your body and see your health care provider right away.

"How are pets and livestock exposed to blue-green algae?
Pets and livestock with no other source of drinking water may be poisoned by drinking contaminated water with blue-green algae. To reduce risk to livestock, do not allow rainwater or other surface runoff to flow through livestock areas. It may be important to provide a drinking tub/trough for your animals other than depending on water that has collected in an earthen tank or pond.

"How long does a bloom last?
Blooms may last for weeks, months, or possibly all year."

From the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/ebfd3a9c-1eec-4922-a0c4-d102a5edd7a0/files/blue-green-algae.pdf and https://www.waterquality.gov.au/issues/blue-green-algae):
Management of blue-green algae blooms
Algal blooms are most effectively managed at the local level because of the varying circumstances in each case. Local councils and state water authorities are best placed to investigate suspected outbreaks and alert the public of any unsafe waters."

The most effective method of preventing blue-green algal blooms is to minimise the nutrient load entering waterways through actions such as planting or maintaining riparian vegetation, conserving soil, and implementing appropriate treatment and disposal of stormwater, agricultural, industrial, and sewage effluent.

Flow manipulation can also be used to prevent the build-up of blue-green algae or to disperse blooms. In reservoirs used for drinking water supplies, various mechanical methods are often used to mix water and prevent conditions of stratification which could bring about blue-green algal blooms. Comprehensive monitoring programs and emergency plans can reduce impacts when blooms do occur.

Larger water supply authorities generally conduct regular water sampling which allows the public to be quickly notified of any potentially harmful blooms and to obtain drinking water from alternative sources. Unfortunately, there are currently few ways of dispersing blooms without adverse side-effects, and toxins can remain in the water column even when algae are not visible.

Copper-based algicides may be effective in controlling blue-green algae if administered appropriately. Other solutions range from avoiding the extraction of water near blooms, to treating water with chlorine, although residual toxins may need to be removed with a combination of coagulation and filtration.

Australian Government action on blue-green algae
The Australian Government cooperates with state and territory agencies to provide policy guidance on controlling blue-green algal outbreaks.

The National Water Quality Management Strategy is endorsed by all states and territories and provides guidance on blue-green algae monitoring actions, alert systems and treatment options, and general drinking water guidelines.

The Australian Government indirectly helps control blue-green algae with strategies to minimise nutrients entering waterways, investing in effective stormwater management, and delivering water back into the environment.
