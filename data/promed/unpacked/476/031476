EVA Outbreak in France
-----------------
The International Equestrian Federation (FEI) has confirmed that, due
to an outbreak of Equine Viral Arteritis (EVA) in the area, the
Driving event scheduled in Les Haras du Pin in France on 11 Jul 2007
has been cancelled.
EVA is a viral disease, which is mostly spread by breeding activities
(by a stallion spreading the virus through the semen), but can also
infect susceptible horses via the respiratory route. The disease is
characterized by fever, edema and by abortion in pregnant mares.
Movement restrictions in the departments of Eure and Orne have been
affected. Horses in the centre at Val de Reuil, where the infection
surfaced, have been isolated. Further investigations are ongoing.
Horse owners planning to travel in the areas involved should update
themselves on any movement restrictions in place.

[Detailed information about EVA from the USDA, including history,
transmission, symptoms, clinical signs, treatment, prevention and
control is available at

Iowa State's Center for Food Security and Public Health provides a
nice summary of equine viral arteritis:
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/equine_viral_arteritis.pdf> .
Equine viral arteritis (EVA) is a contagious viral disease of equids
caused by equine arteritis virus (EAV), an RNA virus that is
classified in the family Arteriviridae. The virus is found in horse
populations in many countries world-wide. The disease has been
reported to the OIE, in the past, from Europe, Africa, North America,
Australia and New Zealand, but not (yet?) from Asia and South America.
EVA cannot be differentiated clinically from a number of other
respiratory and systemic equine diseases. While laboratory-confirmed
outbreaks of EVA have been infrequently reported in the past, the
incidence of the disease appears to be on the increase. Although many
cases of EAV infection are subclinical, certain virus strains can
cause disease of varying severity characterized principally by fever,
depression, anorexia, dependent edema, especially of the limbs,
scrotum and prepuce in the stallion, conjunctivitis, an
urticarial-type skin reaction, abortion and, rarely, a fulminating
pneumonia or pneumo-enteritis in young foals. Apart from mortality in
young foals, the case-fatality rate in outbreaks of EVA is very low.
Affected horses almost invariably make complete clinical recoveries.
A long-term carrier state can occur in a high percentage of infected
stallions, but not in mares or nonbreeding horses. There is
considerable evidence that short- and long-term carrier stallions
shed EAV constantly in the semen but not in respiratory secretions or
urine. International movements of horses, as well as their semen, is
liable to testing and certification which are specified in chapter
2.5.10.1 of the International Animal Health Code:
<http://www.oie.int/downld/SC/2007/en_chapitre_2.5.10..pdf>.
According to OIE's Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and
Vaccines, stallions should first be serologically tested. Virus
isolation should be attempted from the semen of stallions that are
positive for antibodies to EVA and that do not have a satisfactory
history of vaccination against EVA. - Mods.AS/TG]
[The 2 most important routes of transmission of the virus are
respiratory via the acutely infected horse and venereal via the acute
or chronically infected stallion. Aerosol transmission is the
principal means of spread of infection among horses closely
congregated such as at racetracks, shows, and sales. Venereal
transmission by an infected stallion is frequently responsible for
dissemination of the virus on breeding farms.
Indirect spread of the virus through contact with contaminated
fomites (e.g., shanks, twitches, apparel, and personnel) is of minor
significance during outbreaks. Congenital infection of foals due to
exposure of mares late in gestation has been infrequently recorded.
A significant percentage of stallions become carriers after exposure
to the virus. These stallions transmit the virus venereally and play
a major role in maintaining infection in horse populations from year
to year. Attempts to establish the carrier state in mares, geldings,
and sexually immature colts have been unsuccessful.
No specific antiviral treatment is available. Symptomatic treatment
(antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and diuretics) is indicated. Good
nursing and rest with a gradual return to normal activity are
desirable. There is no known medical means of eliminating the carrier
state in the stallion.
EVA can be prevented and controlled by sound management practices and
selective use of a commercial, modified live virus vaccine. While the
vaccine is both safe and immunogenic for stallions and non-pregnant
mares, it is not recommended for use in pregnant mares, or in foals
less than 6 weeks old. Prevention and control programs are aimed at
curtailing dissemination of the infection. This minimizes the risk of
virus-related abortions and helps prevent development of the carrier
state in stallions. - Mod.TG]
