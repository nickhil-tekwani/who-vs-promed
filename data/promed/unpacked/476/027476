An outbreak of measles in North Central Nigeria has left more than
200 children dead in Zaria and its environs. Also, hundreds of others
are currently lying critically ill in both public and private
hospitals in Zaria alone, PANA reports, quoting local Nigerian newspapers here.

"There are fears that the killer disease is now spreading fast to
other neighbouring local government areas, including Sabon Gari,
Hunkuyi, Soba, Makarfi, Giwa and Kubau," the report said. Casualty
figures of those who have already been killed by the disease in these
new areas have not been made available by health officials.

The Zaria local government Area Health Coordinator, Dr. Aminu Gidado,
confirmed the outbreak of the disease in the city and its environs
but stressed that only scores of children have died so far from its
effects. The Kaduna State Commissioner for Information, Alhaji Saidu
Adamu, however, told newsmen that the government had responded
swiftly by sending a team of health officials [designated as a]
"Rapid Response Team" to the affected areas to curb the spread.

Also speaking on the matter, the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Everton
Yari Peters, said that in addition to dispatching the Rapid Response
Team to the affected areas, his ministry also sent about 8000 doses
of vaccines for routine immunisation of about 7000 children. Peters,
however, blamed some parents for refusing to take their children for
immunisation or allow immunisation officials into their homes owing
to religious sentiments.

The measles outbreak was 1st reported last month [November 2007] in
several wards in Zaria and its environs, including Unguwar Fatika,
Limanci, Kaura, Kusfa and Jushi. Parents of some of the victims told
newsmen at the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH),
Shika, Zaria, on Saturday [8 Dec 2007] that the Kaduna state
government had been paying mere lip service to its "Free Medical
Service to Pregnant Women and Children Under Five Years."

Zaria is the principal city in the state of Kaduna, which is located
in north-central Nigeria. The state has a Muslim population, and
there has been some resistance on religious grounds to accepting
universal vaccination. The scale and extent of the outbreak of
measles indicates that the uptake of vaccine has been disappointing
and that many children are still at risk. - Mod.CP]
