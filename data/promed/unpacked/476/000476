The legionnaire's disease epidemic which is threatening 56 people is
Australia's largest outbreak. Of those who have visited the Melbourne
Aquarium during 11-21 Apr 2000, 2 elderly women have died while 8 people
are in critical condition from the deadly bacterial disease. On the weekend
of 29-30 April, 12 new cases have been diagnosed while 29 have so far been
confirmed as infected. Another 27 who have shown flu-like symptoms are
awaiting their test results. The aquarium said that attendance over the
29-30 April weekend has plunged by about 40 per cent.
