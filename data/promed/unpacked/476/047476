First Report of _Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus_, the Agent of Citrus
Huanglongbing (Ex-greening) in Bhutan.
Doe Doe, Namgay Om, Chencho Dorji, and Thinlay, National Plant Protection
Centre (NPPC) P.O. Box 670, Thimphu, Bhutan; M Garnier, S
Jagoueix-Eveillard, and JM Bové, UMR GDPP, Institut National de la
Recherche Agronomique (INRA) BP 81, 33883 Villenave d' Ornon cedex, France.
Plant Dis. 87:448, 2003; published on-line as D-2003- 0211-02N, 2003.

Mandarin (_Citrus reticulata_) is the most important cash crop in Bhutan,
consisting of ca. 1.8 million trees (Ministry of Agriculture, Thimphu,
Bhutan, 2000). Most trees are a local mandarin variety. Seedlings trees are
produced by local farmers, from the Druk Seed Nursery or, in some cases,
from India. By the mid-1990s, mandarin trees growing in Punakha Valley and
Wangdue districts began showing symptoms of decline that included sparse
yellow foliage and shoot die-back.
Based on survey results in 2000, huanglongbing (HLB) was suspected as the
cause of declining trees based on symptomatology and presence of the
psyllid vector _Diaphorina citri_ [Dc], but no confirmatory tests were
performed.
In August 2002, 8 locations were surveyed in the valley from Rimchu (north)
to Kamichu (south). HLB-like leaf mottle symptoms were observed on
declining mandarin trees at all locations at altitudes ranging from 700 to
1 450 m. Orchards near Punakha (1350 m) in the center of the valley were
more severely affected. Symptoms were also observed on Mexican lime (_C.
aurantifolia_), citron (_C. medica_), and on tangelo trees (Minneola,
Seminola, and Iyo) introduced originally as certified HLB-free budwood from
Corsica, France and grafted onto Rangpur lime at the Wangdue Research
Center (1300 m).
To confirm presence of HLB in affected trees, leaves were collected from
symptomatic trees and 3 declining mandarin trees without characteristic
leaf mottle symptoms. 2 PCR tests for the detection of HLB _Liberibacter_
species (1,2) were performed on 16 DNA samples extracted from leaf
mid-veins of 10 mandarins, 2 Mexican limes, 3 tangelos, and 1 citron tree.
_Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus_ was readily detected by both PCR assays
in all but 2 samples (1 mandarin with noncharacteristic symptoms and
citron) and all sampled orchards. The presence in the Wangdue Research
Center of liberibacter-infected trees, propagated from certified HLB-free
budwood, suggests that natural spread of the HLB by Dc is occurring, as the
psyllid had been identified previously in the Punakha area by Bhutanese
entomologists.
It is likely that the disease was originally introduced as infected
planting material, although its source has not been determined.

First Report of Citrus Greening Disease and Associated Bacterium
_Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus_ from Bhutan.
Y. S. Ahlawat and V. K. Baranwal, Plant Virology Unit, Division of Plant
Pathology, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, New Delhi-110012
India; Thinlay and Doe Doe, National Plant Protection Centre, Royal
Government of Bhutan, Semtokha, Bhutan; and S. Majumder, Plant Virology
Unit, Division of Plant Pathology, Indian Agricultural Research Institute,
Pusa, New Delhi-110012 India. Plant Dis. 87:448, 2003; published on-line as
D-2003-0218-01N, 2003. Accepted for publication 28 Jan 2003.
During July 2002, surveys of mandarin orchards were conducted in Punakha
Valley and Wangdue districts of Bhutan. Symptoms of huanglongbing (HLB)
were observed in most orchards. Disease incidence in 24 private orchards
(ca. 5000 trees) was as high as 30 percent. Affected trees were generally
stunted with leaves showing symptoms of mottling, occasionally in only part
of the canopy.
HLB is caused by a fastidious phloem-restricted bacterium, _Candidatus
Liberibacter asiaticus_ in Asian countries and _Candidatus Liberibacter
africanus_ in African countries.
To confirm the presence of this bacterium in Bhutan, 33 leaf samples were
collected from 7 locations in Bhutan and stored at -80°C. Petioles and
midribs were used for extraction of DNA using DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen
Gmbh, Hilden, Germany).
PCR was initially performed with a sample from Rimchu, Bhutan using primer
pair 5'TATAAAGGTTGACCTTTCGAGTTT/5'ACAAAAGCAGAAA TAGCACGAACAA previously
designed for amplification of ribosomal protein genes of beta-operon of 2
liberibacter species (1).
An amplicon of approximately 700 bp, similar to the PCR product that was
amplified from _Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus_... was cloned in pGEM-T
easy vector and sequenced. The clone was 703 nt long and showed 100 percent
sequence homology with the corresponding sequence of _Candidatus
Liberibacter asiaticus_ confirming that _Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus_
is the cause of greening disease in Bhutan. A sample from each location was
analyzed and found to be positive for HLB.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of this bacterium and HLB from
Bhutan. HLB appears to be the main cause of declining citrus in the Punakha
Region of Bhutan.

[These reports are the second and third in recent months that describe
citrus HLB. I note that there are 2 spellings for the disease in the
literature; huanglongbing and huanglongbin (phonetically: wung-long-bing).
Can any of our readers provide an explanation for these different
spellings? There has also been some confusion over the nomenclature of the
causal organism. The correct spellings are: _Liberibacter asiaticus_ (for
the Asian form) and _Liberibacter africanus_ (for the African form).
There is no cure for the disease at present. More than 20 plant diseases
are associated with or known to be caused by bacteria-like organisms
(BLOs), which range in size from 0.25 to 0.5 by 0.8 to 4.0 micrometers. HLB
has been reported in Australasia (Northern Territory [Australia], Papua New
Guinea, East Timor) and in South Africa. A similar disease (cucurbit
yellow vine disease) has been reported to infect canteloupe, pumpkin,
squash and watermelon in USA (Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee &
Massachusetts). - Mod.DH]
