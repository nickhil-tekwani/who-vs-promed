Brief Report: Update: Measles Among Adoptees from China - Wed 14 Apr 2004
---------------------------------------------------
As of Wed 14 Apr 2004, investigators had identified 6 confirmed and 3
suspected cases of measles among the 12 adoptees from China who
departed for the United States on 26 Mar 2004 (Reference 1; and
ProMED-mail post Measles, adoptees - USA ex China 20040411.0985). 3
other children remain under observation by public health authorities.
The latest confirmed cases of measles were in an adoptee aged 13
months who traveled to New York state and in an adoptee aged 12
months who traveled to Washington state.
Among the 9 children with either confirmed or suspected measles, 3
had been considered infectious while traveling. A 4th child has been
identified as potentially infectious during travel on the following
commercial airline flights:
[These were given incorrectly -- see correct information in [2] below. -
Mod.JW]
Persons on these flights who have fever and rash on or before Sat 17
Apr 2004 should be evaluated for measles by a health-care provider.
Although the typical incubation period for measles from exposure to
rash onset is approximately 10 days (range: 7 to 18 days), on rare
occasions the incubation period can be as long as 19 to 21 days.
Other children adopted recently from China, not identified by this
investigation, might have been exposed to measles and become
potentially infectious. Health-care providers should remain vigilant
for measles among persons with febrile rash illness. Persons with
suspected measles should be reported immediately to local public
health officials.

Update: Multistate Investigation of Measles Among Adoptees from China -- 16
Apr 2004
------------------------------
CDC recently published information about 6 confirmed and 3 suspected cases
of measles among children who were adopted in China (1,2). Preliminary
investigation into the source of measles exposure among the recent U.S.
adoptees has traced the presumed source of the outbreak to an orphanage in
China where an outbreak of measles has been reported. While control
measures are being implemented, CDC recommends that adoption proceedings of
children from the affected orphanage be suspended temporarily.
The children departed for the United States with their families on 26 Mar
2004. 4 of these children probably were infectious while traveling from
China to the United States*.
The Chinese Ministry of Health and the Central China Adoption Agency are
aware of the problem and are investigating further. CDC is collaborating
with these agencies and other partners in China to initiate measures to
control and prevent further spread of measles among adopted children. The
public health response to this outbreak is similar to the activities
conducted after an outbreak of measles among adoptees from China in 2001 (3).
Prospective parents who are traveling internationally to adopt children and
their household contacts should ensure that they have a history of natural
disease or have been vaccinated according to guidelines of the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices (4). Prospective parents of
international adoptees from China should stay informed as more information
becomes available about the measles outbreak. Additional information about
this outbreak and information for prospective parents adopting children
internationally is available from CDC at
<http://www.cdc.gov/travel/other/adoption.htm>.
