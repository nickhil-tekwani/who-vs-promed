So-called "mad cow disease" was discovered after a 5-year-old animal died at Boghead Farm in Lumsden. The carcasses, described as 3 cohorts and one offspring, are now being tested at a specialist facility in Dumfries. The Scottish government insists there is "no risk to consumer health."

The news of the culling was confirmed during a session of the rural economy committee at Holyrood, when Conservative MSP Peter Chapman asked Mr Ewing how the BSE investigations were going.

The cabinet secretary replied, "The news is hugely disappointing to have the confirmed case of BSE in Aberdeenshire. There is no risk to consumer health. The Scottish government has activated plans to protect food safety and the valuable farming industry."

The investigation would take time, he said, and he asked senior official Elinor Mitchell to explain.

Mitchell said, "Yesterday, the 3 cohort animals and one offspring were culled on the farm. The carcasses have been transported for sampling and disposal to Dumfries. Tests will determine if the carcasses are then taken to the APHA Weybridge offices for further testing."

The isolated case involves Boghead Farm in Lumsden. There have been 16 cases of BSE in the UK in the past 7 years.

In contrast, thousands of cattle were infected at the height of the BSE crisis back in the 1980s and 1990s. More than 4 million animals were slaughtered in an attempt to halt the disease.

Mad cow disease is down but not out. A case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the cattle infection that causes the lethal human brain disease vCJD, was confirmed on [Thu 18 Oct 2018] in the UK. The cow had died unexpectedly on a farm in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, so was tested under routine surveillance procedures.

"The BSE case is a very unwelcome development, of course, but not a complete surprise. The positive angle to this story is that our surveillance system is working," said Mark Woolhouse at the University of Edinburgh.

That cow, its offspring, and any cattle of the same age on the farm have since been destroyed, meaning the "prion" -- the misshapen protein that causes BSE -- has been contained. But the case, 10 years after the last mad cow in Scotland, is a reminder of how BSE can lurk undetected, even when the cattle feed that spreads it is controlled to prevent prion contamination, and countries are actively on the lookout for fresh cases.

The case itself is not surprising. A mathematical analysis [https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01302246/document] in 2016 found that BSE could linger on in British cattle until 2025, with a few cases a year despite feed controls. Overall, the BSE picture is actually looking good in the UK, where the disease began.

However, many of the UK animals that have tested positive for BSE in recent years were infected by prions that arise spontaneously among cattle, rather than the prions that cause vCJD. The latest case was the 2nd kind: it was what is now called "classical" BSE, which has so far killed more than 220 people worldwide. There have been only 76 classical BSE cases detected in the European Union since 2010.

Although the rate at which new ones appear is steadily falling, additional cases could be lurking, partly because BSE is so hard to spot. In 2016, the EU tested more than 1.3 million cattle and found only 5 cases. All were in France or Spain, and only one of these was classical. What's more, tests of EU cattle have revealed that the 2016 classical case, like the Aberdeenshire case, arose despite the affected cow being born after the elimination of contaminated feed. This raises the issue of whether countries are doing enough to catch new cases of BSE.

Within the EU, vigilance varies greatly, and the countries that recently detected cases have surveillance systems that are 9 times as effective as those in countries that haven't found any, according to the European Food Safety Authority. Moreover, infected animals and feed were shipped worldwide to places, including Russia, Indonesia, India, and Saudi Arabia, but few of the countries who bought them have yet reported BSE, and none do much surveillance. All fear the long-term loss of beef exports that follows the discovery of BSE: China started buying British beef again only this year [2018].

Of these countries, only Canada, Japan, the USA, and Israel have reported any mad cows. Japan tested 1.6 million cattle to find its 36 cases. Although the USA slaughters 35 million cattle a year, it tests only 40 000 and has detected only one home-grown case so far.

William Hueston of the University of Minnesota says he fears that, as memories of BSE fade, some countries might start feeding cattle remains to cattle again, thinking they are prion-free. It could take time to spot any trouble. Research published last year [2017] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28237235] suggests that even the best EU surveillance practices would take 15 years to detect a nascent epidemic if one started unexpectedly, for example, in the USA. During that time, people would have eaten thousands of infected cattle.

Thus, reports that BSE is "almost extinct" could prove premature. Scotland's case this month [October 2018] could be one of its last, but it might just be the tip of an iceberg.

[The described classic BARB (born after the ban) BSE in a 5-year-old cow in Scotland warrants, according to EU requirements, a thorough investigation, on top of the prescribed detection, culling, and testing of its cohorts and progeny (which can be found on one or more farms). A particular attention is paid to the 1st months of the cow's life, when the infection takes place, and to the composition and origin of feed and milk replacers used on the index farm preceding and during the birth year of the affected animal. Investigations of BARB cases can be particularly difficult due to the time lag between exposure to the BSE agent and the onset of clinical signs, the small number of cases (making attribution of source difficult), loss of paper records, and changes in farm management.

A scientific opinion from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommended the creation of a predefined set of epidemiological data to be collected across the EU for the investigation of suspected and confirmed BSE cases.

Irish investigators have recently published the detailed course and methods applied during their investigation of a classic BARB BSE case in 2015 involving a dairy cow that remained, throughout her life, on the premises where she was born in 2010 and eventually euthanised after a short disease/recumbency. They presented an epidemiological framework and a questionnaire to aid the investigation of suspect and confirmed BSE cases. The framework focuses on confirmation and discrimination, estimating the date and location of exposure, and determining the method/source of exposure. The questionnaire (with 135 questions) aids data collection.

The authors recommended that the framework and questionnaire are used concurrently.
