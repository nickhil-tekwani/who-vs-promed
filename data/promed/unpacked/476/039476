In a follow-up on a report 2 weeks ago, on 29 Aug 2021, in the Itasy region, Arivonimamo health district, an alert was received by the health authorities regarding cases of pulmonary plague. As of 16 Sep 2021, a total of 38 suspected cases of pulmonary plague including 19 confirmed and 6 death cases (CFR= 15.8%) are reported so far.

Active case finding, chemoprophylaxis for high-risk contacts of alive and death cases are ongoing, as well as regular meetings of the plague control committees at regional and health district level, mass sensitization activities, contact tracing, ongoing investigation, as well as vector and anti-reservoir control measures.

Pneumonic plague is the most serious form and is the only form that can be spread from person to person. Pneumonic plague can develop from inhaling infectious droplets or may develop from untreated bubonic or septicemic plague.

Individuals with pneumonic plague develop fever, headache, weakness, and a rapidly developing pneumonia with shortness of breath, chest pain, and sometimes watery or bloody mucous.

[Plague infections in Madagascar have been relatively quiet since the dramatic outbreak in 2017. The numbers in this cluster of cases have increased somewhat.

The following information is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al. Plague, a reemerging disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis. 1998; 4(1): 101-4; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm:

Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had 'virtually disappeared' on the island due to efficient pest control and good health management. However, since 1990, annually more than 200 cases are being reported, and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45% of all the cases of plague in Africa.

Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node that drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the "black plague," and also may spread to the lungs causing hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission. Not all initial cases of plague pneumonia occur with a preceding bubonic phase, and when the lung infection spreads from person to person, there is no bubonic stage. - Mod.LL
