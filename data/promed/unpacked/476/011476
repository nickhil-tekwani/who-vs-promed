Fran Lopez-Ruiz, Centre for Crop and Disease Management (CCDM), said there had been samples of net form of net blotch (NFNB) coming in from South Australia's Yorke Peninsula with dual resistance against 2 of the most common modes of action in fungicide, the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI)-based products as well as some demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides.

Testing found the strain of NFNB had mutated for resistance. The samples, collected from 2 paddocks a short distance apart, clearly showed high NFNB disease levels on the Spartacus variety of barley.

The DMI fungicide resistance mechanism is still being investigated, [but] Dr Lopez-Ruiz said it was known to be different to the DMI resistance mechanisms already reported in barley net blotches in Western Australia [ProMED-mail post 20180727.5931094]. The 1st cases of fungicide resistance [of net blotches] in Australia occurred in Tasmania.

[Net blotch of barley is caused by the fungus _Pyrenophora teres_ and affects only domestic and wild barleys (_Hordeum_ spp.). The disease causes necrotic areas on leaves that reduce photosynthetic capacity and hence plant vigour, leading to yield losses of up to 20%. There are 2 types of the fungus, the net type caused by _P. t._ f. _teres_ and the spot type caused by _P. t._ f. _maculata_. The fungus survives between seasons on barley residues, volunteer barley plants, some grasses, and seed. Disease management includes cultural practices to remove pathogen reservoirs, fungicide applications, use of clean seed, and use of resistant cultivars.

Highly aggressive new strains of particularly the net form are emerging worldwide. Integrated disease management, including varying crops or crop cultivars in time and space, as well as rotating or mixing chemical classes of fungicides, is vital to extend the useful life of host resistances and agrochemical compounds.

In Australia, net blotch is considered an emerging threat to southern barley-producing areas (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20100323.0921). SDHI resistance has been reported in Europe, for example in the UK (ProMED-mail post 20140507.2457504), but not previously in Australia.

SDHI (succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor) fungicides are not new; their previous limited use meant that resistance under commercial conditions remained limited to a few pathogens and crops. A "2nd generation" of SDHIs is currently being used to combat fungal diseases that have developed resistance to other groups of fungicides. DMI (demethylation inhibitor) fungicides were introduced in the 1970s.
