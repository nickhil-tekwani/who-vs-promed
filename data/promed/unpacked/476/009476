'Rare but dangerous' tick-borne virus spreading around Pa.: What you can do
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another illness transmitted by ticks is spreading around Pennsylvania, state officials announced. It's called Deer Tick Virus and is a type of Powassan virus. DTV is considered "rare but dangerous," officials said in a news release Tuesday [8 Mar 2022] that indicated the illness had been found in 15 Pennsylvania counties. By week's end, that count was up to 16, including one contiguous to the Lehigh Valley.

As with Lyme disease, another tickborne illness, there is no vaccine to prevent the transmission of DTV in humans. Nor is there a medicine to treat it. (Lyme disease can be treated early through antibiotics.) That leaves caution and prevention as the best steps to avoid falling victim.

"Lyme disease has been present in all 67 counties for some time, and unfortunately, the prevalence of the very serious Deer Tick Virus appears to be increasing in some tick populations," Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Patrick McDonnell said in the release.

Powassan virus can be transmitted from tick to human in as little as 15 minutes after a bite occurs, while Lyme takes much longer to cause infection -- often 24 hours or more after the tick attaches to the host.

Initial symptoms of a DTV infection may include fever, headache, vomiting and weakness. Some people who are infected experience no symptoms, and an infection may go undetected. However, 91% of patients treated for DTV infections develop severe neuroinvasive disease, meaning it's capable of infecting the nervous system.

Those who exhibit severe disease from Deer Tick Virus may experience encephalitis or meningitis and require hospitalization, with symptoms including confusion, loss of coordination, difficulty speaking, or seizures. About 12% of people with severe disease have died, and approximately half of survivors of severe disease have suffered long-term health impacts.

Through routine testing in the Pennsylvania DEP's 5-year pilot tick surveillance program started in 2018, "unusually high infection rates" of Deer Tick Virus have been found in adult tick samples taken from 3 sites: Fisherman's Paradise public fishing area on Spring Creek in Centre County; Iroquois Trail near Tunkhannock in Wyoming County; and Lawrence Township Recreational Park in Clearfield County. At each of these 3 locations, the infection rate exceeded 80% of ticks sampled.

Outside those hotspots, the statewide infection rate is currently around 0.6% of ticks sampled, with DTV also confirmed in Adams, Allegheny, Columbia, Dauphin, Fayette, Lebanon, Mifflin, Monroe, Montgomery, Schuylkill, Venango, Washington and Westmoreland counties.

The previous highest DTV infection rate found at a single location in Pennsylvania was 11%, and the highest infection rate reported nationally in scientific literature was around 25%, state officials said.

Pennsylvania's warning about DTV comes as residents increasingly venture outdoors amid warming weather. However, deer ticks -- also known as blacklegged ticks -- are active even in winter when temperatures are in the mid-30s F [negative 1 deg C] and above, state officials warned.

The DEP has posted signage to alert the public and will conduct control measures and additional testing to reduce and monitor the number of ticks present in the recreational areas with high positivity rates for Deer Tick Virus, officials said.

"By learning where ticks live, seeking treatment if experiencing symptoms, and following the best practices for prevention, we can avoid cases of Lyme disease and other tickborne illnesses," stated Dr. Denise Johnson, Pennsylvania's physician general. "The Department of Health estimates that there is at least one Lyme disease case for every 100 people in Pennsylvania every year. Lyme disease can cause flu-like symptoms and a rash in the early stages, but the infection could spread to joints, the heart, and the nervous system if not addressed. If you are experiencing symptoms, I encourage you to see your health care provider right away."

Recommended precautions for avoiding ticks include:
- Apply tick repellents containing permethrin to clothing and EPA-registered insect repellents such as DEET to exposed skin before entering the outdoors. Reapply as needed according to product label instructions.
- Wear light-colored outer clothing and tuck shirts into pants.
- Walk in the centers of trails, and avoid wooded and brushy areas with low-growing vegetation and tall grasses that may harbor ticks.
- After returning home, remove all clothing, take a shower and place clothing into the dryer to kill any lingering ticks. Federal health officials said 6 minutes on high heat in the dryer effectively kills ticks. If clothing is soiled and requires washing first, research indicates clothing should be washed at water temperatures equal or greater to 130 degrees Fahrenheit [54 deg C] to kill ticks.
- Examine gear such as backpacks for ticks.
- Conduct a full-body tick check using a hand or full-length mirror, including hidden areas such as the scalp, ears, armpits, belly button and between the legs.
- Check over any pets exposed to likely tick habitats each time they return indoors.

If a tick is found attached to your skin, use tweezers to remove it carefully, including the head. Monitor for symptoms and contact your doctor with any questions.

"Pennsylvanians should learn about the threats posed by tickborne diseases and take commonsense precautions so they can enjoy our abundant natural resources -- and the many wonderful physical and mental health benefits of outdoor recreation -- as safely as possible," stated Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Secretary Cindy Adams Dunn.

[The season for tick activity and transmission of Deertick (Powassan ) virus (DTV) in Pennsylvania has begun already. The prevalence of DTV in the blacklegged ticks (_Ixodes scapularis_) in a previous report from Pennsylvania was unusually high (92%) (see Powassan virus encephalitis - USA: (PA) 20220122.8701018). Control of these ticks is difficult, with avoidance of tick bites being the best way to prevent becoming infected with the virus. Although this tick feeds preferentially on white-footed mice (_Peromyscus leucopus_) and white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_), only the mice are reservoir hosts of DTV.

Tick transmission of Powassan virus (POWV) to humans is active in the Upper Midwestern and north eastern states of the USA including Pennsylvania. As noted in earlier posts, humans become infected with POWV during spillover transmission from natural transmission cycles. In humans, POWV is the causative agent of a severe neuroinvasive illness with 50% of survivors displaying long-term neurological sequelae. POWV was recognized as a human pathogen in 1958, when a young boy died of severe encephalitis in Powassan, Ontario, Canada.

There are 2 distinct genetic lineages of POWV now recognized: POWV (lineage I) and black-legged tick virus (lineage II), the likely lineage found in the ticks mentioned above. Since the index case in 1958, over 100 human cases of POWV have been reported, with an apparent rise in disease incidence in the past 16 years. This recent increase in cases may represent a true emergence of POWV in regions where the tick vector species are prevalent, or it could represent an increase in POWV surveillance and diagnosis. In the past 8 years, both basic and applied research into POWV disease have intensified, including phylogenetic studies, field surveillance, case studies, and animal model development.

Residents and visitors to Pennsylvania and other localities where Powassan virus occurs are well-advised to heed the CDC's advice to avoid tick bites (see https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/avoid/on_people.html). The fact that cases of human Powassan virus infections occur only rarely does not mean that precautions should be ignored. - Mod.TY
