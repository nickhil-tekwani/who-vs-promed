There are also [besides marssonina blotch which has been reported recently
in ProMED-mail post no. 20080813.2501] reports of another fungal disease
called scab emerging after many years from some pockets of the apple belt.
This disease wreaked havoc in the mid 1980s and was brought under control
with great difficulty by farmers. The state horticulture department has
deputed 5 teams of experts to visit the scab-affected areas.

Director (of horticulture) Gurdev Singh said 37 tonnes of additional
fungicides have been procured and dispatched to the affected areas to
contain both marssonina and scab diseases.

[Apple scab, also called black spot, is caused by the fungus _Venturia
inaequalis_ and is considered the most economically important disease of
apples worldwide. Infected fruit is often unmarketable and harvest losses
can be more than 70 per cent if favourable weather conditions prevail. The
pathogen infects only species of _Malus_, while other fungi in the same
genus are known to cause scab diseases on different hosts, including pears
and nashi fruit. Leaf symptoms include dark spots, and severe infections
may cause the leaves to fall prematurely. On fruit, lesions appear and the
skin ruptures around them revealing a dark velvety layer of spores. Older
lesions become corky in appearance. Early infections often result in large
fruit lesions and severely cracked and malformed fruit.

The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the ground. Spores are
discharged during rainy periods and can be spread with infected plant
material, by mechanical means, and carried long distances in air currents.
Secondary infections are spread short distances mainly by splashing rain
and cause additional build-up of the disease. Early infections are most
damaging since fruit becomes more resistant as it matures, requiring
increasingly longer wet periods for infection. Disease management is
expensive requiring up to 12 fungicide sprays a year in areas where scab
has become established. Apple cultivars vary in their susceptibility to
scab. Resistant varieties are available, but few of them are currently
suitable for commercial production, and resistance breeding continues.

The concurrent occurrence of both scab and marssonina may prove devastating
for apple crops in the area.
