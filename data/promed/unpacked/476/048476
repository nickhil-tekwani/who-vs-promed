1st report of _Plum pox virus_ in Israel
----------------------------------------
The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of Israel recently informed EPPO of the 1st record of _Plum pox virus_ (_Potyvirus_, PPV - EPPO A2 List) on its territory.

In April 2013, PPV was found on apricot and plum (_Prunus armeniaca_, _P. domestica_) in 2 small commercial orchards (2.6 ha [6.4 acres] in total, density of 500 trees/ha [about 200/acre]) at Zichron Yaakov [Haifa District]. Unusual symptoms had been noticed by the grower. Laboratory studies (ELISA, RT-PCR, TaqMan RT-PCR, and sequencing) confirmed the presence of PPV-D in diseased trees.

Eradication measures were taken. Both orchards were uprooted and burnt. All trees within a radius of 500 m [0.3 mi] around any infected tree were tested (ELISA and TaqMan RT-PCR). A plan of action to continue surveying all surrounding areas and nurseries was developed and is being implemented.

[_Plum pox virus_ (PPV; genus _Potyvirus_; also called Sharka virus) has been reported from Europe, parts of Asia, northern Africa, and the Americas but is still absent from Australia and New Zealand. It affects species in the genus _Prunus_ and may cause up to 100 percent yield loss in stone fruit crops. Some hosts in other genera are also susceptible, including hops, pea, tomato, and a number of weedy annual plants. Symptoms on _Prunus_ species can occur on leaves and fruit. They may include ring or line patterns, mottling, distortion, and can lead to premature fruit drop and shoot dieback. Infection may be symptomless in some host species.

PPV is transmitted by a number of aphid species, mechanical means (such as orchard tools), and grafting, as well as with infected propagation and other plant material. It may be seed transmitted in some host species but is not known to be transmitted by pollen or plant-to-plant contact. The importance of herbaceous plants in the epidemiology of PPV is still being debated. Cuttings of stone fruit trees pose the greatest risk of introducing the virus to a new area. Disease management is difficult but may include control of the vector insects, removal of virus reservoirs and use of certified planting and grafting material. Resistant cultivars are available for several types of stone fruits, including plum.

According to their serological and molecular properties, PPV isolates have now been grouped into 6 strains, some of which do not infect certain _Prunus_ species: PPV-D, PPV-M, PPV-EA, PPV-C, PPV-W, and PPV-Rec (recombinant between D and M strains). M and D are the main strains; W has been eradicated from the field but is held in collections. (Ref: N Capote et al, 2006: A review of _Plum pox virus_.
