A horse in Highlands County has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis, and residents should be aware of mosquito protection measures, the Florida Department of Health in Highlands County said.

Statewide, this is the 15th equine to be reported with eastern equine encephalitis this year [2016] and the 1st for Highlands County.

Most people who become infected with the virus have no apparent illness. Severe cases of eastern equine encephalitis begin with sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills and vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures or coma, the health department said. There is no specific treatment for eastern equine encephalitis.

"If you experience symptoms of this illness, consult with your healthcare provider and take steps to protect yourself against further mosquito bites. Avoiding mosquito bites while you are sick will also help protect others from infection," the department advised. Health officials also reminded residents that "the best way to protect themselves from mosquito-borne illness is to prevent mosquito bites by practicing good drain and cover methods:"

A horse in Greenville County [South Carolina] died from a mosquito-borne disease, according to state officials.

Recent cases of Eastern equine encephalitis have moved beyond the coast to the Midlands and the Upstate said Boyd Parr, state veterinarian and livestock-poultry health director. "One of these cases is in Greenville County and is the 1st confirmed case in the Upstate in 2016," Parr said. "The Greenville County case was a 10-year-old quarter horse. The 2nd new case was a 5-year-old quarter horse in Horry County. Neither of these horses had been vaccinated according to label instructions and neither survived."

A total of 11 cases have been confirmed by Clemson Livestock-Poultry Health so far in 7 counties, 4 in Horry County alone. Berkeley, Colleton, Dorchester, Marion counties have also reported cases, as has Kershaw County in the Midlands. "Confirmation of the cases in Greenville and Kershaw counties provides solid evidence that the risk to South Carolina horses from EEE is not confined to our coastal counties but is indeed statewide," Parr said. "It reminds us of the importance of taking immediate precautions to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases."

A simple vaccine will minimize the risk of EEE, but the disease is almost always fatal to exposed, unvaccinated horses. Though less common, the mosquito-borne illness can also affect humans. "It can get out of hand if we don't vaccinate horses and control mosquitoes," Parr said. "Last year's [2015] floods across much of South Carolina made conditions favorable for mosquito breeding. The best defense for horse owners is to maintain current equine vaccinations for Eastern equine encephalitis, West Nile virus and rabies for their horses."

Parr also recommends that all South Carolinians take steps to reduce mosquito breeding by eliminating common sources of still water in which the insects lay their eggs. Draining or washing receptacles like bird baths, wading pools and garden ponds on a weekly basis can disrupt the mosquito breeding cycle. Likewise, removing open containers that collect rainwater will help reduce the mosquito population and hence the threat of disease.

The EEE virus is maintained in nature through a virus cycle involving the freshwater swamp mosquito, _Culiseta melanura_, commonly known as the blacktailed mosquito. In 2 to 3 days after becoming infected with the virus, a mosquito becomes capable of transmitting the virus. Infected mosquitoes can transmit the disease when they bite horses and humans.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, eastern equine encephalitis is a rare illness in humans. Most persons infected with it have no apparent illness. Severe cases begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills and vomiting.

In horses, signs of EEE usually develop 2 to 5 days after exposure. These include stumbling, circling, head pressing, depression or apprehension, weakness of legs, partial paralysis, inability to stand, muscle twitching or death.

Any livestock, including horses, that display these signs must be reported to the state veterinarian at 803-788-2260 within 48 hours, according to state law.

[The most effective EEE prevention is vaccination. The vaccine is usually combined with vaccines for West Nile virus and western equine encephalitis. Most owners usually vaccinate in the spring, but immunity to EEE is the shortest and wanes within about 3-4 months. Owners are encouraged to vaccinate every 3 to 4 months to protect against EEE.

In the United States, equine vaccines are available for eastern equine encephalomyelitis (or eastern equine encephalitis, EEE), western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE), Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE), and West Nile virus encephalomyelitis.
