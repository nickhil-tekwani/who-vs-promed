Notice to Readers: Manufacturer's Recall of Human Rabies Vaccine --- April
2, 2004
--------------------------
CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have been notified that a
recent quality-assurance test of IMOVAX® Rabies Vaccine (Aventis Pasteur,
Swiftwater, Pennsylvania) identified the presence of noninactivated
Pitman-Moore virus (the attenuated vaccine strain) in a single product lot.
IMOVAX® is an inactivated viral vaccine and should not contain live virus.
The vaccine lot containing noninactivated virus was not distributed.
As a precautionary measure, Aventis Pasteur initiated a voluntary recall of
lot numbers X0667-2, X0667-3, W1419-2, and W1419-3, which were produced
during the same period as the lot that contained noninactivated
Pitman-Moore virus. These four lots, which were distributed in the United
States from September 23, 2003 through April 2, 2004, passed all
FDA-approved release tests, including testing to confirm the absence of
live virus. These test results suggest that any potential risk to those
vaccinated with recalled vaccine is likely to be low. No unusual adverse
events associated with the recalled vaccine have been reported.
The manufacturer has indicated that additional lots of recalled vaccine
were distributed internationally. These lots also passed all release tests,
including testing to confirm the absence of live virus. The manufacturer is
working with regulatory authorities to determine lot numbers of vaccine and
countries that might have received recalled lots. More information about
these internationally distributed lots will be provided as it becomes
available.
Aventis Pasteur is providing additional detailed information to all
distributors and providers. Health-care providers should contact persons
who received recalled vaccine to implement the recommendations outlined in
this notice (see Recommendations for Persons Who Received Recalled
Vaccine). In addition, persons who know they received rabies vaccine
between 23 Sep 2003, and 2 Apr 2004, should contact their health-care
providers to determine whether they received vaccine from one of the four
lots being recalled and, if so, whether they should be treated as outlined
below. Vaccine distributors and health-care providers who have any
remaining doses of the recalled lots should not use them and should contact
Aventis Pasteur regarding their disposition. Information about this recall
is available from the Aventis Pasteur Medical Information Services
Department, telephone 800-835-3587, or at <http://www.vaccineshoppe.com>.
All persons who have begun a rabies vaccination series (whether for pre- or
postexposure prophylaxis) must complete that vaccination series on time,
using nonrecalled vaccine. Information about human rabies prevention based
on current recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP) is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056176.htm>.
Recommendations for Persons Who Received Recalled Rabies Vaccine
Most persons receiving rabies vaccine do so because of exposure to a rabid
animal, and treatment is needed to prevent fatal illness. Thus, persons who
are receiving postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) must not omit or delay
receiving any remaining injections; injections needed to complete the
series should use nonrecalled vaccine. Recalled vaccine is considered fully
immunogenic, and previously administered doses can be considered a dose in
a PEP regimen.
Although unlikely, a theoretical possibility exists that persons who
received vaccine from a recalled lot could have been exposed to the
noninactivated Pitman-Moore vaccine strain of rabies virus. Even in the
event of such an exposure, the timely administration of treatment, as
described here, will help to ensure negligible risk to persons who have
received vaccine from a recalled lot. Persons who received recalled vaccine
should receive treatment equivalent to PEP, similar to published
guidelines, as follows:
Persons who were vaccinated with recalled vaccine as part of a course of
PEP for a possible rabies exposure.
Not previously immune (i.e., persons who had not received at least 3 doses
of vaccine at some time before the possible rabies exposure). Persons
without prior immunity who have a possible rabies exposure routinely
receive a 5-dose postexposure immunization series. If this postexposure
series has not already been completed, such persons should complete the
full postexposure series, using nonrecalled vaccine to complete the series.
Doses that have been administered already as part of the 5-dose series need
not be repeated, even if recalled vaccine was used. In addition, if rabies
immune globulin (RIG)* was not administered with the first dose of vaccine
and it has been <7 days since the first dose of vaccine, RIG should be
administered at this time. Once PEP is completed, persons are considered
fully vaccinated against both the original rabies exposure and any possible
exposure to noninactivated virus in the recalled vaccine.
Previously immune (i.e., persons who had received at least 3 doses of
vaccine at some time before the possible rabies exposure). Persons with
preexisting immunity (i.e., who have completed a full preexposure or
postexposure vaccination series) who then have a possible rabies exposure
routinely receive 2 booster doses of rabies vaccine. If one or both doses
already were administered using recalled vaccine, such persons should
receive 2 more doses, using nonrecalled vaccine. RIG is not recommended.
Persons who were vaccinated with recalled vaccine for reasons other than a
possible rabies exposure.
Not previously immune (i.e., persons who had not received at least 3 doses
of vaccine at some previous time). Persons without prior immunity who
received recalled vaccine as part of a 3-dose preexposure vaccination
series should receive additional doses using nonrecalled vaccine for a
total of 5 doses (dosing intervals should follow the PEP schedule as
closely as possible). RIG* is recommended if <7 days have elapsed since
administration of the first dose of vaccine.
Previously immune (i.e., persons who had received at least 3 doses of
vaccine at some previous time). Persons with preexisting immunity (i.e.,
who have completed a full preexposure or postexposure vaccination series
before they received recalled vaccine) who received recalled vaccine as a
routine booster dose should receive 2 additional doses of nonrecalled
vaccine. RIG is not recommended.
All clinically significant adverse events following receipt of rabies
vaccine should be reported to 1) Aventis Pasteur, telephone 800-835-3587
and 2) the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) at
<http://www.vaers.org>, or telephone 800-822-7967. Additional information
about rabies and its prevention is available from CDC, telephone
404-639-1050, or at <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/rabies>.
* Where available (including the United States), Human Rabies Immune
Globulin (HRIG) is preferred and is administered in a dose of 20 IU/kg.
Where HRIG is not available, Equine Rabies Immune Globulin may be used in a
dose of 40 IU/kg. These dosages are applicable for all age groups,
including children. For persons receiving RIG after having received
recalled vaccine administered as part of PEP, as much of the dose as is
anatomically feasible should be infiltrated at the site of the original
rabies exposure (e.g., a wound), and as much of the remaining dose as is
anatomically feasible should be infiltrated at the site(s) where the
recalled vaccine was injected. If any RIG remains, it should be
administered intramuscularly at an anatomically distant site. Persons
receiving RIG for recalled vaccine administered as part of a preexposure
vaccination series should have as much of the dose as is anatomically
feasible infiltrated at the site(s) where recalled vaccine was
administered, and the rest should be administered intramuscularly at an
anatomically distant site. RIG should never be administered in the same
syringe as vaccine, or into the same anatomical site used for concomitant
vaccination. Because RIG might partially suppress active production of
antibody, no more than the recommended dose should be administered.

recommendations take into consideration the possibility of vaccination with
a live virus. More information on the lot numbers involved in the European
distribution is awaited. - Mod.MPP]
