Manitoba: Weekly West Nile Virus Update #2
------------------------------------------
A total of 4 birds have tested positive for West Nile virus in Manitoba: 3
crows in the Capital Region of Winnipeg (East St. Paul, St. James, and
Transcona); and one magpie in Central Region (Rural Municipality of Portage
La Prairie).
Manitoba Public Health will continue to issue bulletins as birds with West
Nile virus are confirmed in each of the 5 Regional Response Team areas of
the province. These include the Capital Region of Winnipeg, Central,
Western, Eastern and Northern
regions: <http://www.gov.mb.ca/health/wnv/response.html>.
As of Thu 26 Jun 2003, more than 359 birds have been tested for West Nile
virus in Manitoba. The bird surveillance program began on 1 May 2003.
There have been no human cases of West Nile virus diagnosed in Manitoba.
Testing birds from the crow family provides an early indication of West
Nile virus in mosquitoes. Manitobans can continue to help detect the
arrival of West Nile virus in their area by reporting dead crows, blue
jays, magpies, or ravens to Health Links at 788-8200 in Winnipeg (outside
of Winnipeg toll-free 1-888-315-9257). Once testing has demonstrated the
presence of WNv in a specific area, further pickup and testing of birds in
that area will be given a lower priority than birds found in areas where
WNv has not yet been discovered.
