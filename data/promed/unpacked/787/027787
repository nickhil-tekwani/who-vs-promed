----------------------------------------------------------------------
About the use of coyote urine to deter desert kit foxes. I wouldn't expect anyone who knows much about coyotes to do this anyway, because this approach to attempting to deter other predators doesn't make much sense.

First, a coyote is actually more a scavenger than a predator. A coyote is no threat to the major prey or offspring of larger predators, so most larger predators pay no attention to coyotes, except to regard them as nature's garbage collectors, who finish off a carcass after the puma, grizzly bear, or whatever eats his/her fill.

Wolves, however, do kill marauding coyotes, and coyotes have historically shared most of their range with wolves. This has conditioned coyotes to be rather careful about where they leave their signs. To other animals, coyote signs probably signify mainly that no wolves are nearby.

Except in mating and denning season, coyote signs -- unless very fresh -- usually do not mean a coyote is anywhere close. Coyotes do not defend a territory, unlike wolves, and except when they have pups in the den, they rarely sleep in the same place twice. As soon as the pups are old enough to move, mama coyotes begin moving them every night from one den to another. The whole idea is to avoid making a particular habitat smell like coyote, which might make the litter vulnerable.

Where coyotes are present, foxes tend to retreat to the margins of the habitat, but not so much because coyotes are a threat to them as because coyotes tend to monopolize the available carrion and rabbits. This is simply because coyotes are slightly bigger animals, who are active for much more of each 24-hour cycle, and therefore have bigger appetites.

Fortunately for foxes, though, coyotes are not as easily able to take advantage of the hunting opportunities in and around old stone walls, rock slides, etc., so that's where the foxes go while the coyotes patrol the roadsides and meadows. Sometimes at night they'll yip at each other -- but usually the coyotes are more or less just passing through, whereas foxes will use the same den locations (if undisturbed by humans) for generations.

Foxes also tend to bury carrion near their dens as a ready source of food while nursing pups. It is relatively easy to sniff out a fox den. There is no way to sniff out a coyote den that still has coyotes in it. I have found occupied coyote dens several times, but the only time I found one by sniffing was once when I thought I'd found a large rabbit warren. Turned out the coyotes had very recently taken it over.

Sometimes coyotes try to steal a fox's carrion supply. Pouring coyote urine around a fox den would most likely signify to a fox only that a coyote might have been around looking for the stash, but had departed, since a coyote who was still engaged in the search would not give away his/her presence.

Coyotes are tricksters and practical jokers, of a sort, and will leave calling cards at times just to get other animals excited, especially dogs who are left chained outdoors and cannot get at them.
