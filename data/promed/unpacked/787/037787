Raw almonds are recalled over food poisoning reports
----------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON: A California company is recalling 5 million pounds of raw
almonds sold nationwide after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
received seven reports of food poisoning. Paramount Farms of Los Angeles
said yesterday that the almonds may contain salmonella, which can cause
food poisoning. The recall covers packages of raw almonds sold under the
brand names Kirkland Signature, Sunkist, and Trader Joe's.
The FDA received reports that 7 people in Alaska, Arizona, Oregon,
Washington, and Utah were ill after eating the almonds. All recovered, the
company said. The almonds sold under the Kirkland Signature brand were
labeled raw, sold in 3-pound bags and stamped with a "best before" date
from 8/21/04 to 2/8/05. Recalled almonds sold under Trader Joe's and
Sunkist brands were marked with "best before dates" of 8/21/04 to 3/15/05.
The Trader Joe's almonds are in 1-pound packages labeled as "nonpareil
variety almonds." Those sold by Sunkist are in 10-ounce bags labeled "raw
natural whole almonds."
Paramount can be reached today starting at noon PDT by calling 800-496-5168.

Paramount Farms Announces Nationwide Recall of Whole National Raw Almonds
Contact: Chris Tuffli 310-966-5731
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -- Lost Hills, CA -- May 18, 2004 -- Paramount Farms
today announced that it is a voluntarily recalling from distribution whole
natural raw almonds sold under the Kirkland Signature, Trader Joe's and
Sunkist brands. The almonds sold under the Kirkland Signature brand,
available exclusively at Costco Wholesale Inc., were marked "raw almonds"
and were packaged in three-pound, lay-flat plastic bags stamped with "best
before" date from 8/21/04 through 2/8/05. For Trader Joe's and Sunkist, the
packages bear the "best before" dates of 8/21/04 through 3/15/05. The
almonds sold by Trader Joe's are in a one-pound lay-flat plastic bag marked
"nonpareil variety raw almonds" and the almonds sold by Sunkist are in a
10-ounce lay-flat plastic bag marked "raw natural whole almonds."
Paramount is taking this precaution action after learning from the Food and
Drug Administration that there are 7 cases of illnesses from _Salmonella
enteritidis_ in Alaska, Arizona, Oregon, Washington and Utah. In all of
these cases, the individuals who consumed California whole natural raw
almonds recovered, and, in 5 of these cases, the individuals purchased
almonds from Costco Wholesale Inc. in Oregon.
Salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal
infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with
weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with salmonella often
experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and
abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infections with Salmonella can
result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more
severe illnesses such as arterial infections, endocarditis and arthritis.
"While no salmonella has been found in Paramount products, we have taken
this aggressive step out of an abundance of caution and to assure our
customers and consumers of the quality and safety of our products, "said
David Szeflin, vice president, Operations. We're working diligently with
the FDA and state health officials to make sure that any product that has
not yet been consumed is returned.

[Seven cases, in 5 states. Presumably their food histories identified raw
almonds as the only common link. The networking of data seems awesome and
ProMED-mail would welcome details of the surveillance mechanism. We look
forward to hearing whether a microbiological link is established, following
the swift and substantial response of Paramount products. - Mod.SH]
