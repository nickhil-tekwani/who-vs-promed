Today [22 Nov 2021], Sami Al-Huwaidi, head of the local Union of Agriculture and Fishing in Bouarqoub [Bou Argoub], announced the registration of cases of bluetongue [BT] disease among herds of cattle in the region. BT, a contagious disease that affects cattle and sheep, is transmitted through [a midge] that reproduces in this season, he explained.

Al-Huwaidi added that 10 foci of BT disease were discovered in the area of Bouarqoub, including Burj Hafeez, Bousham, Bali, Mashrouha, and El-Kharrouba. He called on livestock breeders of cattle and sheep to be vigilant. He also called on the Ministry of Agriculture to take all preventive and ministerial measures to limit the spread of vectors and expedite the assessment of the situation, and to safeguard compensation for the animal growers.

According to another Tunisian media source (Shems FM, dated 23 Nov 2021), "since the end of October 2021, the regional office for agricultural development in Siliana has recorded 12 cases of epizootic hemorrhagic disease in cattle, in 6 different outbreaks located in the region, in addition to one case in sheep." Siliana's location is presented on the map at https://tinyurl.com/dh744ft6. For the media report and commentary, please refer to PRO/MENA post 20211124.8699837.

In mid-October 2021, bluetongue was reported from several locations in Tunisia in sheep and cattle (see ProMED post 20211016.8699099).

Both bluetongue and epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) are vectorborne, transmitted by culicoides midges. Both belong to the genus _Orbivirus_, family Reoviridae.

BTV is known to cause, predominantly, a serious clinical disease in susceptible sheep breeds, while cattle and goats remain, in most cases -- save serotype 8, in cattle -- subclinical. EHDV, on the other hand, is known to cause clinical disease in white-tailed deer and cattle, while sheep are subclinical.

It is difficult, if not impossible, to differentiate the clinical symptoms of BT and EHD in cattle. Due to their similar vectors, both present similar seasonality. Both viruses have been identified in the past in Tunisia.

It is essential to obtain lab confirmations of the orbivirus(es) BT and/or EHD in samples collected from cattle and sheep in the affected regions, including their subtyping and genotyping. Relevant OIE reference laboratories are located in the UK (Pirbright) and Italy (Teramo). ProMED would appreciate receiving the results of the investigation.

Western regions in the Mediterranean basin have suffered considerable outbreaks of BTV-4 in sheep since June 2021. This includes Spain's Balearic Islands, France's Corsica, Italy's Sardinia, Tunisia, and Spain's southern territory bordering Morocco. The disease has also been suspected in Algeria.

Outbreaks in northern Tunisia are about 220 km (137 mi) distant from western Sicily. In suitable weather conditions, BTV/EHDV-infected culicoids can be carried by the wind for such and longer distances. - Mod.AS
