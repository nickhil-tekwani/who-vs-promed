A meningitis outbreak in Burkina Faso has infected thousands of people,
killing hundreds, in the past 2 months, the health ministry told the AFP
Thursday [6 March 2008]. "We have identified 3181 suspected cases of
meningitis from 1 Jan 2008 until 2 Mar 2008, of whom 366 have died," said
Doctor Ousmane Badolo, head of epidemiology surveillance at the ministry of
health.

Fourteen districts are affected, 5 of which have declared a state of
epidemic. Of those, 2 have been downgraded following vaccination campaigns.
Badolo said Burkina Faso had enough vaccines to cover all infected
districts although needs could change if the outbreak worsens.

Meningitis is very contagious, causing fever, dizziness, vomiting, and a
stiff neck. It becomes an epidemic when 10 out of 100 000 inhabitants have
contracted it. Health minister Alain Bedouma announced Wednesday [5 Mar
2008] that Burkina Faso managed to raise over 4.5 million euros [7 025
217.87 USD] from numerous international donor countries and organisations
for a plan to fight the disease that was set up in 2007. In 2007 an
epidemic killed more than 2000 people in 9 West African countries, 75 per
cent of them in Burkina Faso, according to United Nations agencies.

[The meningococcal meningitis outbreak in Burkina Faso continues to worsen.
According to a prior ProMED-mail post (Meningitis, meningococcal - Africa:
meningitis belt 20080225.0756), Burkina Faso was the most affected country
with a total of 1422 cases, including 204 deaths (case fatality rate 14.3
per cent) reported from 1 Jan to 10 Feb 2008. At that time these cases
represent more than 61 per cent of all cases reported to the WHO
Multi-Disease Surveillance Centre in 2008 (against 64 per cent for the same
period in 2007). _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A was identified as the
causative agent in 2 of the Burkina Faso districts, where vaccination
targeted the 2 to 29 year old population. See prior ProMED-mail posts
listed below for more information.
