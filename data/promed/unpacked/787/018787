A nursing college student has died in the Eastern Province [Ash Sharqiyah] of Saudi Arabia after contraction swine H1N1 virus infection.

Meanwhile, the Health Ministry announced one MERS death and 4 infections on Saturday [24 May 2014], adding that 2 patients have recovered. The victim was a 40-year-old woman, who was admitted to a hospital in Riyadh on [8 May 2014]. The infections were in Riyadh, Madinah, and Qunfuda [Gonfodah].

Her death [the influenza patient] is the 1st caused by the virus in 2 years. [However], an infectious disease consultant, who spoke on condition of anonymity, ruled out the possibility that the female student's death implies the reappearance of the H1N1 influenza virus. "It is still too early to draw conclusions on such a case before examining the details," said the source.

"While the student tested negative for the [MERS] coronavirus, her tests came back positive for the H1N1 virus," the directorate said. "The student had already been hospitalized at the King Fahd Military Medical Complex after she became critical after failing to respond to treatment."

[The most recent WHO Global Influenza Update reported that the Northern Africa and the Western and Central Asia regions currently remained free of influenza virus infection (http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/). Therefore, the appearance of a fatal case of influenza A(H1N1) virus infection is noteworthy. It is unclear from this report if the nursing student's death is being attributed in fact to coronavirus infection. Clarification would be appreciated. - Mod.CP
