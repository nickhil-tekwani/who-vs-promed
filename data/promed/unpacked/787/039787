As many as 8 suspected cases of chikungunya were reported from 4 villages of Hukkeri Taluk on Saturday [1 Jun 2013]. District health officials have taken all precautionary measures to control the disease.

According to district health official sources, there have been no cases of chikungunya [virus infections] in the district for the past 2 years, but this year [2013] already the district has reported 6 cases. There are 8 suspected chikungunya cases in 4 villages of Hukkeri Taluk: Gejapati, Guthugutti, Rajagatti, and Yellapur villages with populations of 1200, 2700, 2000, and 600 people respectively. The 4 villages come under the care of Islamphur Public Health Centre.

When many people came to the health centre with similar symptoms, health officials became alert and when they inspected the villages [they suspected] cases of chikungunya [virus infections]. The district administration has taken all precautionary measures to tackle the disease. The district health officer Dr Dileep Kumar Munoli, Dr Jagadish Nuchin, district surveillance officer, and Dr Rajanish Meti, district epidemiologist visited the villages, [assessed the situation], and made necessary arrangements to tackle the disease. The health officials also conducted house-to-house larvae surveys and fogging. The health department has also set up mobile clinics in the villages.

Due to the scarcity of water, people in villages store water for longer periods without proper cover, which favors mosquito [reproduction]. Hence, health officials have called upon the people to keep water containers properly and tightly closed.

[No mention is made of the clinical symptoms observed in these cases, and especially of acute arthralgia, a common symptom of most chikungunya virus infections. Joint pain can be so severe that it is incapacitating, and may last for weeks or months. It is not stated if samples have been sent for laboratory tests. This is important to know if this outbreak is really due to chikungunya virus or to dengue virus infections, or to a mixed outbreak of both. Interestingly, there is another outbreak of chikungunya virus infections in south east Karnataka state, far from the one described above.
