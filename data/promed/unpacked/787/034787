The Eastern Massasauga rattlesnake, an animal that counts Barry County and other parts of Michigan as places to call home, is being hit with snake fungal disease, and some experts are worried it could mean big trouble for the small rattler. Scientists from a collection of agencies, led by Grand Valley State University's Dr Jennifer Moore, tested snakes at 3 locations in the state, including Barry County and Pierce Cedar Creek Institute, in 2014 and genetic analysis showed the presence of the disease.

The other locations were near Grayling and Cassopolis. The snake can also be found in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, although agricultural development in the "corn belt" has reduced those numbers. Snake fungal disease can cause swelling of the skin, scabs and what Institute Education and Field Station director Sara Syswerda said were tumors that grow slowly because of the Massasauga's low metabolic rate. "It causes them to either have trouble eating or they go blind, which causes them to have trouble eating," said Syswerda. "As far as I can tell, they either starve to death or they slowly die."

Syswerda said at this point, there's not much to be done except track the snakes and see what happens. While she fears that this could be, as she said, the nail in the coffin for a species that's lost a lot of its habitat to human development, there are hopes to maintain enough of them so that they can continue to breed.

Snake tracking, Syswerda said, is often done through microchip implants, similar to how dogs and cats can get microchips that can be scanned in case they get lost. Syswerda said that when the research team was at Pierce, about 80 to 90 snakes were identified. "They don't know how this disease is transmitted to the snakes," Syswerda said. "They don't know where the fungal spores are within the environment. They don't know if it's the soil, in the water or if it's direct snake-to-snake contact. That seems unlikely, just because the snakes pretty much never run into each other."

The Massasauga has managed a stable population in Barry County because of the relatively little land development. There are several state game and recreation areas, Southwest Michigan Land Conservancy properties, farmers and environmentally minded folks who aren't eager to see a lot of new buildings and pavement, and Pierce Cedar Creek Institute's property at 701 W Cloverdale Road, Hastings.

However, Syswerda said most, if not all, counties in lower Michigan have Massasauga sightings, particularly along the I-94 corridor. In fact, the shy snake may have been very close to you the last time you were out in nature, and you may not have known it.

Michigan Society of Herpetologists President Eric Tobin said most people don't know there is a rattlesnake in Michigan, or they might think it's a ferocious killer. It's more likely to quietly sit and wait for any human passersby to pass them by, Tobin said. Still, it does have a venomous bite that can strike those who, for example, decide they want to pick one up.

Whatever a human's experience with the snakes is, Tobin said the Massasauga's survival is something we should all care about. "Anytime that you take a species out of the equation, something else is going to happen," Tobin said. "Usually it's things that humans don't want to have -- such as insects, such as rodents. Those animals are there to control those populations and without that we could be overrun by something else we don't like."

In the halls of Pierce Cedar Creek Institute, Syswerda was gathering photos of Massasauga that had been taken around the property. As she looked at them, she talked about all the reasons we might want to notice what's happening with the snakes. For one thing, they're an indicator species that can tell us how good our wetlands are doing by their very presence. That becomes important when it rains; it's much better to have wild land absorb the water than have pavement carry it into your basement. But there are other reasons to care, Syswerda said.

"There are not that many wild things left in the world," Syswerda said. "It's kind of like when you see a bear, when you see cougar or even a wolf, to think that there are still wild things out in the world, that you can see that are ... I don't know. To me, it's pretty cool that when you go out, even in places that don't seem that wild, that this is still a possibility."

[Snake fungal disease (SFD) is an emerging disease of wild snakes in the eastern and midwestern USA. The likely etiologic agent is the fungus _Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola_, which is consistently associated with the often-fatal skin, face, and eye lesions characteristic of the disease. In recent years, cases of this fungal infection have been increasing and this report is evidence of its spread throughout natural snake populations.

A picture of the lesions observed in snakes with SFD can be seen at http://mongabay-images.s3.amazonaws.com/13/0906snake2.jpg. A picture of a Massasauga rattlesnake (_Sistrurus catenatus_) can be accessed at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Massasauga_rattlesnake_1.jpg.

Research should address the investigation of the factors that determine an apparent increase in the incidence and the spread of this disease in natural snake populations.
