Health ministry reports outbreak of yellow fever
------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has reported an outbreak of yellow fever [YF] in
Liberia. Deputy health minister Dr Bernice Dahn told reporters the disease
was diagnosed in a 32 year old man who died in Nimba County. The chief
medical officer said a specimen from the man tested positive in Liberia and
confirmed in Darkar, Senegal. According to Dr Dahn, one case of yellow
fever is considered an outbreak because before it is confirmed it may have
already spread to several people.

The Health Ministry has reported the case to the World Health Organization
in accordance with International Health Regulations. The ministry has also
sent its surveillance officers in Grand Gedeh and Nimba Counties where the
disease has been traced. The surveillance officers will investigate whether
the yellow fever case is the 1st and whether it has already been
transmitted to other people.

Dr Dahn informed reporters that the government is working with WHO to bring
in vaccines for treatment as the one in Liberia is only for prevention.

The chief medical officer called on people to keep their surroundings
clean, as the mosquito that transmits yellow fewer breeds in poor sanitary
conditions. Meanwhile, WHO said it would work with the Health Ministry to
identify more resources to address the yellow fever outbreak in Liberia.

WHO country director Dr Eugene Nyarko told reporters his organization has
reported the case to the next level and is awaiting a response. He said
with the international alert, partners involved with yellow fever will now
turn their attention to Liberia. Dr Nyarko gave assurances that WHO will
work with the Health Ministry in carrying out preventive measures firstly
in Nimba and Grand Gedeh Counties.

[It is not clear what the difference might be between YF virus vaccines for
prevention, already in Liberia, and the imported vaccine for treatment. In
any event, vaccination is essential and urgent to prevent person-to-person
transmission of YF virus and the development of an outbreak. The evidence
for tracing the YF case to both Grand Gedeh and Nimba Counties is not
stated. The mosquito vector _Aedes aegypti_ can breed in water catchments
in and around houses, even though general sanitary conditions may be good.
