Malt-O-Meal recalls cereal linked to _Salmonella_
Malt-O-Meal Inc. recalled up to 3 million pounds of cereal nationwide
Friday because of a possible link to _Salmonella_ poisoning in 12 states.
The cereal manufacturer asked grocers to pull from their shelves the
Malt-O-Meal brand of plain Toasty-Os and Toasted Oats, as well as plain
toasted oat cereals sold at 38 supermarket chains under various brand
names. "Obviously the Malt-O-Meal company is deeply concerned that one of
our products, the plain toasted oat cereal, has been linked to some
illnesses," president John Lettmann said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported nearly 200
cases of an unusual strain of salmonella since early April and said 40
people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. The cause of
the contamination isn't known. "It'll probably be days or weeks before we
know anything," said CDC spokesman Tom Skinner. Stores where the cereals
are sold include Kroger's, A&P, Safeway, Jewel and Foodland.
The affected cereal is sold in 10- to 40-ounce bags and 15- and 35-ounce
boxes. They should be returned to the store where purchased. John Lumpkin,
director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, said that cereal is
an unusual source of _Salmonella_. Bacteria may have entered the cereal
through contamination of a water pipe or something else in the
manufacturing process or through human contamination, he said.
Malt-O-Meal, based in Minneapolis, said it learned Sunday that its
Millville brand cereal sold at Aldi supermarkets in the Chicago area was
the possible source of the unusual strain of salmonella. The next day, Aldi
pulled boxes of Millville Toasted Oats off the shelves at all its stores in
16 states. Only the Millville Toasted Oats and Malt-O-Meal Toasted Oats are
suspected of causing illness. The other brands are being recalled as a
precaution.
Malt-O-Meal pulled about 75 samples from its Northfield plant, where the
Millville line is produced, for testing. All the tests came back negative
for the _Salmonella agona_ strain, so more tests are planned. The company
also temporarily shut down the line that makes the cereal. Lettmann said he
doesn't know how much the recall will cost the company. Other Malt-O-Meal
products, including flavored toasted oat products, were not involved in the
recall.
On Thursday, the CDC reported 188 confirmed cases of _Salmonella_ poisoning
in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan,
Iowa, Kansas, Wisconsin and West Virginia. That number is expected to rise.
The agona strain accounts for only about 500 to 1,000 of the estimated 2
million to 4 million salmonella cases in the United States each year, the
CDC said. The bacteria is usually found in animals, including poultry,
cattle and pigs, but it also can be found in humans.
The brands of plain toasted oats cereal recalled Friday by Malt-O-Meal
Inc., followed by stores in which the brands are regionally distributed.
The recall affects only Malt-O-Meal's plain toasted oat cereals. In
addition to the store brands, the company also is recalling its own
national brand, Malt-O-Meal, marketed under the names Toasty-O's or Toasted
Oats.
