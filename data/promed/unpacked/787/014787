Sea turtles are dying along the South Carolina coast this year in
numbers that surprise wildlife officials. Nearly 80 sea turtles have
washed ashore in South Carolina either dead or dying since January
2003.
Many of them have rotting flippers, parasite-riddled bodies, and
shells encrusted with barnacles, said Sally Murphy, a sea turtle
biologist with the Natural Resources Department.
Wildlife biologists and turtle experts say hypothermia and pollution
may be among the causes.
Mary Schneider of Pawleys Island found one of the most recent turtles
May 26 at the south end of the Litchfield section of Georgetown
County. State officials shipped the turtle, which was barely alive,
to North Carolina State University for tests.
"I've never seen a more heavily parasitized sea turtle, both
internally and externally," said veterinarian Greg Lewbart, who
helped perform the examination. Leeches covered the turtle's skin,
and flukes lined its stomach and intestines. Worms clogged its blood
vessels and major organs.
"Even healthy turtles have some parasites," Lewbart said. "But if
they're allowed to overrun the host, that's when you have a problem."
Dead turtles are not unusual in the spring, when loggerheads and
others swim from wintering grounds in the Gulf of Mexico, biologists
say. The number of is like nothing South Carolina biologists have
seen, Natural Resources Department officials say. The number of dead
turtles is up this year from 45 in 2002 and 27 in 2001.
The deaths are happening as nesting season picks up. A dozen turtle
nests have turned up in Horry County in the last month, compared with
2 for all of last season. Georgetown beaches have seen 58 nests
since May 21, said Jeff McClary, head of South Carolina United Turtle
Enthusiasts.
There are several theories on the turtle deaths. A sudden cold spell
early in the fall of 2002 may have caught some turtles off Guard
while they fed in North Carolina's Pamlico Sound. As cold-blooded
animals, turtles' body temperatures reflect the air or water
temperatures around them. The sudden chill may have "cold stunned"
the turtles, Murphy said, causing their core body temperatures to
plummet and making it hard for them to feed. The weakened turtles
could have been swept out of the sound on the tides and survived
until spring, when currents carried them onto South Carolina beaches,
Murphy said.
The fact that most are covered with sea life indicates they haven't
been swimming vigorously, she said.
"Most of them die immediately upon hitting the beach," Murphy said.
But that doesn't explain the whole problem, she said. "Something
else weakened these turtles and kept them from fighting off the
parasites," Murphy said.
An examination of a 10-pound green sea turtle that washed up in
Myrtle Beach had scraps of plastic that had passed through its
digestive tract, the Natural Resources Department said. Turtles have
been known to eat floating plastic, such as sandwich bags, because it
looks like jellyfish, the turtles' favorite food, biologists say. The
bags can lodge in the turtles' digestive system, ultimately starving
them to death. But the turtle examined at North Carolina State
didn't have plastic or other foreign objects in its body, Lewbart
said. "The question is," Lewbart said, "what's out of balance?"

[Undoubtedly weather and pollution will play a role in the turtle's
metabolism and immunity. Is it a lack of food, or is unusual weather
affecting the availability or quality of food for these turtles? One
has to wonder whether these turtles are immunocompromised, or whether
there is some other bacterium, virus, or parasite that is profoundly
affecting these turtles. - Mod.TG]
