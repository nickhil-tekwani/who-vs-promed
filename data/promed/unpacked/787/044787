Regarding the posting "Salmon disappearance - USA (WA)
20050622.1751", has anyone considered gas embolism due to nitrogen
supersaturation? The report talks about "high water temperatures in
the Lake Washington Ship Canal. It's narrow and shallow, and sockeye
have to run it to reach the cool, deep waters of Lake Washington." I
am not familiar with the geography, but if cold lake water runs down
the canal, and heats up during transit, without the opportunity to
outgas, this could contribute to supersaturation. Depending on design
and factors such as water flows and depth, weirs and similar features
in rivers can also contribute to supersaturation.
