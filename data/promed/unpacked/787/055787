[1] Cholera - Angola (southern provinces)

A protracted drought followed by the onset of the rainy season in southern Angola has triggered a sharp increase in cholera cases, mainly concentrated in Cunene province, where over 1000 infections and 48 deaths were recorded during a 2-week period in November 2013, according to figures from the Ministry of Health. Cholera is endemic in Angola, where nearly half of the population lives in conditions conducive to the spread of the illness, according to the WHO.

A year-long outbreak that started in the slums of the capital Luanda in February 2006 and spread to 16 out of 18 provinces resulted in over 80 000 reported cases and 3000 deaths.

So far, the current outbreak has remained almost entirely confined to Cunene, although neighboring Huila province has also recorded some cases. Since January 2013, the country as a whole has recorded just over 5600 cholera cases and 190 deaths, about 70 percent of them in Cunene.

A drought that started at the end of 2011 is now affecting over 1.8 million people, with 5 provinces in the south worst affected, among them Cunene. Acute malnutrition rates as high as 25 percent in areas experiencing food shortages due to the drought have left children highly susceptible to waterborne illnesses including cholera, notes a November 2013 statement from UNICEF.

Pedro Kawilila, a UNICEF representative based in Cunene, says the drought has also forced people to resort to drinking "very dirty water." Cunene's largely rural population relies on "chimpakas," natural and man-made depressions in the ground that store rainwater, primarily as a source of water for their livestock. However, at the height of the drought, when wells and boreholes ran dry, they started collecting stagnant water from the chimpakas for domestic use.

"Cunene is a province that has a problem with the supply of safe water," commented Manuel Eduardo, a WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) specialist working as a consultant for UNICEF in Cunene. "What's needed is a strong programme in terms of people being able to treat water at home and construction of more boreholes. There are boreholes, but some have dried up, and others haven't been maintained. Open defecation is the norm in the province, added Eduardo. "They don't construct latrines, and before the rain, they didn't have enough water to wash their hands and so on."

The lack of safe water and sanitation meant that even before the onset of the rainy season, UNICEF had reported over 1500 cholera cases in Huila, Cunene, and Benguela provinces between January and July 2013, resulting in 62 fatalities. "When the rain started in October 2013, it made it worse," Kawilila told IRIN in a phone interview. "Because of open defecation, the rain swept that stuff into water sources."

[2] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Masvingo Province)

A cholera outbreak has hit Chiredzi with 5 cases recorded so far, Masvingo provincial medical superintended Dr Robert Mudyirandima has said. Dr Mudyirandima said the 5 cases were members from the same family.

"We are not yet sure of the source of the outbreak, but we suspect that a member of the family could have traveled outside the district, or they had a visitor who passed on the bacterium to them," he said.

Dr Mudyirandima dismissed suspicion that the bacteria could have been in drinking water, saying people in that community got water from a common source. He said that if it was in drinking water, more people would have been affected instead of one family.

According to the weekly disease surveillance report, the latest outbreak brings the number of recorded cholera cases to 11 since the beginning of 2013. The last cases of cholera were reported in March 2013 in Beitbridge and Chiredzi.

[The World Health Organization says: "Cholera is an easily treatable disease. The prompt administration of oral rehydration salts to replace lost fluids nearly always results in cure. In especially severe cases, intravenous administration of fluids may be required to save the patient's life" http://www.who.int/topics/cholera/treatment/en.

The remedy can be homemade using the recipe given at: http://rehydrate.org/solutions/homemade.htm#recipe with diagram at: http://rehydrate.org/images/diy3.gif. - Mod.LL
