The analysis of a sample from one Turkish case [carried out at the
U.K National Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), Mill Hill, London]
showed a genetic change which has been seen in previous human cases
in Hong Kong and Viet Nam. However, the London-based team stress the
alteration does not make the virus more likely to pass between humans.
So far, 18 people in Turkey have been infected and 3 have died.
Experts at the NIMR are analysing samples on behalf of the WHO. They
have looked at 2 so far. One has shown a particular mutation of the
haemagglutinin gene, which has also been seen in human viruses during
the 2003 outbreak in Hong Kong and last year's outbreak in Viet Nam.
Because this particular mutation has been seen before in humans,
scientists say there is no reason for these findings to increase
concern. The tests also show that the virus was certainly caught from
birds, and not from other humans.
Sir John Skehel, director of the Medical Research Council's NIMR,
suggested that the change is something that can happen once the virus
gets into a person to make it more efficient within that individual.
The gene sequences of the viruses from Turkey also indicated that
they were sensitive to the antiviral drugs Tamiflu and an old form of
anti-viral medication called amantadine, said the scientists. They
say this might suggest a combination of drugs would be most effective
at tackling the virus if it does mutate into a form which can spread
between humans.

[The importance of the mutation in the haemagglutinin-encoding gene
referred to above is that it is located in the receptor-binding site
of the molecule and is considered to increase the ability of the
virus to attach to human cells. Another relevant omission from the
report is that the virus recovered from a single patient was
heterogenous with respect to this site. Which genotype predominates
and is expressed has not been determined as yet. - Mod.CP]

Genetic tests of samples taken from Turkish victims of the bird flu
virus show it has made a small change but probably not enough to make
it more dangerous yet, researchers said on Thu 12 Jan 2006. The
mutation is one that would be expected in a highly changeable virus,
the experts said, and is one that would be predicted to eventually
allow it to cause a pandemic.
H5N1 avian influenza has caused a burst of human infections in Turkey
and has been found in flocks of poultry across the country. It has
killed 3 children in Turkey and infected a total of 18 people,
according to Turkish authorities. Globally it has infected just 147
people and killed 78 of them, according to the tally from the World
Health Organization, which includes only 4 of the Turkish cases.
Scientists are carefully watching the virus to see if it makes the
changes needed to allow it to pass easily from human to human, which
could spark a pandemic that could kill millions. Samples from 2 of
the first Turkish victims were sent to a WHO-affiliated laboratory in
Britain for analysis.
There were 2 different strains of virus in the bodies of the teenage
victims, said Dr. Ruben Donis, team leader of the molecular genetics
team of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
Influenza branch. "One was a regular virus like we have seen in
poultry in Turkey [Such sequence information has not been published
as far as I am aware - Mod.CP] -- no surprises there," Donis said in
a telephone interview. But half the viruses had a mutation in a
protein called the haemagglutinin, which influenza viruses use to
attach to the cells they infect. This mutation has been found in the
past to allow the virus to infect a greater range of cells via a
structure [containing] sialic acid, Donis said. When researchers have
tested flu viruses in the lab, they found this particular mutation
gave the virus a better ability to attach to human-like cells.
"It is unclear whether the mutation occurred in the person or whether
it occurred in the chicken," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the U.S.
National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "This same
mutation was identified in 2003 in Hong Kong and yet did not take off
in a way that led to greater transmissibility either from chicken to
human or human to human," Fauci said in a telephone interview.
Dr. Guenael Rodier, head of the World Health Organization mission to
Turkey, said there was no evidence the virus had changed either its
infection rate or its pathogenicity. "In local terms (in Turkey) it
is not too worrying," Rodier said in an interview. "We are not
expecting an explosion."
But Rodier and Fauci said it will be important to study the virus
carefully and note how and when it changes. This week researchers at
the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, said they had
developed a quick test, called a glycan array, that could alert
scientists to when the virus changes [see ProMED-mail post: Influenza
virus: receptor specificities 20051222.3658 - Mod.CP]. "For the 1st
time in human history we have the chance and the tools to watch the
virus spreading. In previous pandemics we had to start with the
pandemic," Rodier said.
The H5N1 virus remains largely a virus that affects birds. But all
influenza viruses mutate and evolve very easily, and regularly change
into what are known as pandemic strains, which spread rapidly around
the world, infecting and killing unusually large numbers of people.
