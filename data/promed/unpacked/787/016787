Maine health officials have identified another case of eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE) in a horse in Gorham.

This is the 10th horse to test positive for EEE in the state. A llama
has also tested positive for the disease.

Officials said so far the disease is only spreading in animals but
they are calling the number unprecedented.

Officials in Candia, New Hampshire decided to spray some areas of town
after a 3-year-old resident fell ill with the eastern equine
encephalitis virus. State health officials are calling the recent
increase in EEE [virus] activity disturbing after a 3-year-old girl
and a horse were diagnosed with the illness.

Candia is taking a new look at plans to control the disease. The
reviews of options started as a regular public meeting and ended with
selectmen deciding unanimously to start spraying certain areas to kill
mosquitoes, a swift sign of the seriousness of this year's [2009] EEE
season. The father of this year's only EEE [virus] victim took to the
floor at the meeting where he echoed other requests that Candia take
another look at how it controls mosquitoes.

His 3-year-old daughter is believed to have contracted EEE in the
family's yard. She is recovering and is expected to be released from
the hospital Tuesday [15 Sep 2009]. The father asked the town to
consider using limited chemicals for mosquito control to prevent other
children from contracting the disease. "I just can't imagine what
people would feel like if we'd just done nothing," he said.

Other towns spray to control mosquitoes, but Candia does not. Three
years ago, the town voted down a plan that would have paid to use the
chemical spray in certain areas, including a park and near schools,
but it's clear this year [2009] that EEE is back on the radar. An
alpaca and a llama in Candia died this summer after being infected. A
horse in Henniker was the latest victim of EEE. Horse breeder John Dur
said he has never lost one of his animals to the disease, but in just
25 hours, an 18-month-old horse he cared for went from appearing
perfectly fine to being near death. "I tried to roll her, and she
rolled onto her side, and she couldn't get back up again," Dur said.
The horse was the only one he was taking care of that had not been
vaccinated against the mosquito-borne disease. The horse was euthanized.

State health officials said they have growing concern over the new
cases popping up and recently declared a public health threat in 59
communities. "Mosquitoes do not respect political boundaries," said
Dr. Jose Montero, director of public health. "They fly all over the
place."

The state said its spread is confined to southern parts of the state
so far, but officials don't know how far it could travel. Montero said
the threat of EEE will only end this year [2009] after 2 heavy frosts.
"Before then, they are still there, and they are still active," he
said. For that reason, Dur bought another round of booster shots and
vaccinated the horses that survived. Because of the threat, he said he
didn't have any alternative. "I don't want to take any chances," he
said.

With the looming threat in mind, Candia officials ultimately approved
a limited plan to spray near a school and a park, a decision that
satisfied a father still concerned by his daughter's sudden diagnosis.
"I think that's phenomenal. That exceeded my expectations," the father
said.

State officials said they aren't sure what led to the sudden increase
in incidents of the disease, but the wet summer might have helped
mosquito populations grow.

[The summer of 2009 has been an active season for EEE virus
transmission in the eastern USA. In the neighboring state of Maine, an
infected llama and several equine EEE cases were reported in late
August and into September (2009, see ProMED archive no.
20090911.3203). Transmission of EEE virus among wild birds with
spill-over to humans and unvaccinated horses is likely to continue for
several weeks until killing frosts occur. The northeastern USA has had
abundant rainfall this year (2009) providing ample vector mosquito
breeding habitat. It is unfortunate that the infected horse in
Henniker was unvaccinated. An EEE virus vaccination booster of horses
in this area is prudent. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine
commercially available for humans, and the only preventive measure is
avoidance of mosquito bites through wearing long sleeved shirts, long
pants and application of insect repellant with DEET.
