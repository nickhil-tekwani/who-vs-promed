First Victim of Suspected Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease in Malaysia
----------------------------------------------------------------
A highly contagious virus which has killed 4 children in Singapore has
claimed its first victim in Malaysia with the death of a boy aged 3,
reports said Friday. The Star and New Straits Times reported that the boy
died on Tue 3 Oct 2000 in the southern city of Johor Baru, just across the
border from Singapore. Senior state health official Nooraini Baba was
quoted by the Star as saying the results of blood tests were still awaited.
But she said the boy had symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease; i.e.,
lesions on his hands, feet and around his mouth.
In Singapore, a total of 30 children have been hospitalized with the virus
in the past week and doctors have reported a total of 408 children showing
symptoms of the disease since Sun 1 Oct 2000, when authorities ordered them
to report all cases. The move followed the deaths on Saturday of a toddler
and his 14- month-old sister. The 2 victims had rashes on their hands and
mouth and foot ulcers. The 2 two-year-olds who died last month are also
believed to have succumbed to the virus.
Child-care centers and kindergartens remain closed across Singapore while a
government task force investigates the deaths. Hand, foot and mouth disease
is a viral infection usually confined to children below 10 years of age and
spread by direct contact with bodily fluids. The virus normally has only a
mild impact on affected children but in certain cases can provoke a fatal
reaction. An outbreak of the disease left 50 children dead in the Malaysian
state of Sarawak in 1997 and 78 died from the virus in Taiwan in 1998.
