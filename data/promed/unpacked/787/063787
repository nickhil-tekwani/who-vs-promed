Kansas City has seen a steady, week-by-week rise in the number of people reported suffering from influenza. That is a significant increase, according to Jeff Hershberger of the health department, who said 264 cases, most of which were Type A, turned up during the week of 15 Dec 2013, 100 more than the week before and more than double from 1 Dec 2013.

The most recent report includes 259 cases of Type A flu, 2 of Type B, and 3 that are undefined [?]. Since the flu season [only in the United States] started at the end of September 2013, Hershberger says they've counted 570 cases. "What we've seen over that 4-week trend is a pretty significant increase; however it's still pretty low numbers," says Hershberger. "Now what we have to remember anytime we look at flu numbers is that a lot of people that have the flu will probably try to tough it out at home and not see a doctor."

Those numbers, according to the health department, are under-reported. "The flu tests can build up in costs, so the doctor may be just looking at them and treating them for symptoms, in which case we wouldn't get a report on them having flu," says Hershberger. Regional comparisons around Missouri are difficult to make. St. Louis County had 157 cases in the week before Christmas, 100 fewer than Kansas City. But Kansas City's reporting dates come a week earlier, so the data does not match in real time. Hershberger said there is still time to get possible benefit from flu shots. They may take up to 2 weeks to give maximum benefit but may still ease suffering and duration.

The swine flu virus is rapidly spreading across the United States. Last week, only 4 states were reported with confirmed outbreaks. This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that cases of influenza have become widespread in 33 states, including New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas, Alaska, Louisiana, Virginia, Alabama, and Wyoming, among others.

CDC confirmed that swine flu, also known as H1N1 [influenza A/H1N1 pdm09], is currently resurfacing after its pandemic status in 2009, which led to the deaths of 12 000 Americans. Because of this deadly outbreak, health officials are now encouraging everyone to at least get a seasonal flu shot so as to counter any effects brought about by any form of exposure. The flu shot is said to trigger the production of antibodies that will help fight the H1N1 strain.

As of late, numerous specimens are being tested by the World Health Organization, and, surprisingly, 64 percent of these samples have tested positive for the swine flu virus. H1N1 is actually a flu that started in pigs that managed to spread among humans. Early reports claim that pigs that are kept in unsanitary conditions are at high risk of contracting the flu virus. "This year [2013], because it's an H1N1 season so far, we are seeing more infections in younger adults, and some of these folks have underlying conditions that put them at risk for hospitalization or death," a CDC expert said.

CNN reported that according to several experts, swine flu activity is expected to increase nationally over the next few weeks and is even expected to reach peak levels within the 1st 2 months of 2014.

[These reports confirm that the 2013/2014 winter seasonal influenza virus has begun in the United States and is gaining momentum. So far, no novel influenza viruses have made an appearance. It is likely that the new seasonal northern hemisphere vaccines will provide substantial protection against the strains so far encountered.

Reference to the most recent WHO Global Update as of 20 Dec 2013 [Influenza (69): WHO global update, ProMED-mail Archive Number: 20131223.213294] reveals that Europe and Northern Asia remain largely untroubled by this new outbreak and that cases of influenza have been few or absent. - Mod.CP
