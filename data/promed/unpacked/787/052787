SA ready to prevent foot-and-mouth spread
--------------------------------------------------
Kgabi Mogajane, the Chief Director of Agricultural Regulatory Services,
says South Africa has a contingency plan in force to prevent foot and mouth
disease (FMD) from spreading across its borders. Mogajane says all products
coming into the country are being monitored.
Neighboring countries, including Zimbabwe and Botswana, are experiencing
huge problems with the contagious disease.
Botswana began the process of putting down an estimated 5000 cattle
yesterday within the quarantined northeastern district, which is plagued by
FMD. The highly contagious deadly viral infection has spread from Zimbabwe,
mostly through smuggled meat and cattle.
Zimbabwe's export markets to South Africa and Europe had been closed since
the outbreak of the disease more than a year ago. In November of 2002,
cases of FMD were reported in Mozambique, and last week some were detected
in northern Botswana.
