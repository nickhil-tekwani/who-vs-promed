Botulism outbreak downs dozens of birds
---------------------------------------
Botulism has broken out among the wild birds at Century City's Blouvlei
wetland, home to several rare waterfowl species, where about 130 birds have
died. The contaminated bird carcasses are being burnt on site in a
makeshift incinerator to prevent the disease, which cannot infect humans,
from spreading.
The botulism bacterium blocks the bird's nerve impulses, and paralysis sets
in. Infected birds cannot fly or walk, and ultimately, it affects their
respiratory muscles, and they suffocate.
Century City environment officer Dries Weyers said on Monday [13 Dec 2004]
that the disease had broken out just over 2 weeks ago. Weyers said: "On the
1st day we found 80 dead birds, the 2nd day 25, and the 3rd day it was down
to 4. On Friday, there were none, and this morning there were 3 from over
the weekend, so I think the outbreak has been contained. But we're
patrolling the whole area daily, all the canals and vacant land too. It
takes us about 3 to 4 hours a day. We're going to have to keep on
monitoring it for the next few months."
A member of the Tygerberg Bird Club was the first to spot the dead birds 2
weeks ago and alerted city scientific services manager and fellow club
member Dirk van Driel, who has so far been unable to establish the source
of the botulism. Van Driel said on Monday [13 Dec 2004]: "The botulism
bacterium sits in the soil and can stay dormant for a long time. It needs
animal protein to become virulent. One dead carcass on contaminated soil
can spark off an epidemic. We have to burn the dead birds to kill the
bacteria. If we don't do that, there won't be any birds left."
The botulism has affected mainly Sacred Ibises and some coots. Ibises
scavenge by pecking on rotting carcasses and could contract botulism from
the carcass itself or from eating maggots in the carcass. The infected
birds then contaminate the water with their feces so that ducks, geese, and
other waterfowl become infected.
Van Driel said the botulism bacteria could breed in places like poultry
farms if dead chickens and eggs were thrown out with the chicken manure.
Ibises and a number of other bird species feed on manure and could become
infected. He said it took the birds about 3 days to die after contracting
botulism. "The birds can't fly anymore, and then their legs go lame," he
said. "Typically, they get limber neck syndrome as the disease sets in, and
they can't lift their heads. If this happens to water birds, they can't
lift their heads out of the water and they drown."
Rare birds like the Painted Snipe and the Ethiopian Snipe have been spotted
at Blouvlei, while the Purple Heron breeds there.

[In most cases, the botulism type involved with avians is type C, but
exceptions do occur. Laboratory confirmation will be useful.
Botulism is rather prevalent in South Africa; the Onderstepoort laboratory
has been producing botulism vaccines, types C and D, for decades. - Mod.AS]
