Foot-and-Mouth Detected in Mutare
---------------------------------
New cases of foot-and-mouth disease have been detected in the Zimunya and
Marange communal areas, south of Mutare, a senior official with the
Department of Veterinary Services said on Tue, 18 Feb 2003. Welbourne
Madzima, the deputy director in the department, said field officers were
swiftly dispatched to the affected areas in a bid to control the spread of
the highly contagious disease. Madzima said from Harare: "Our teams are now
on the ground to try and control the spread of the disease. Vaccination had
been delayed as we did not have the vaccine. Now everything is on course."
There were fears this week the disease could have spread to other parts of
Manicaland, notably Chimanimani. In August 2002, foot-and-mouth was
reported in Bikita, Masvingo, Madzima said. He said a month later 3 herds
of cattle were moved illegally from Bikita to Birchenough Bridge, and sold
to a butchery."That movement of infected cattle led to the spread of the
disease from Bikita to Buhera," Madzima said.
While 2 beasts were slaughtered by the butchery, the third was left to roam
with other cattle, infecting them in the process. Madzima warned that it
was illegal to move livestock from one district or area to another without
a permit from the department. "If the people involved do not abide by the
veterinary regulations," Madzima said, "the government will continue to
lose foreign currency through their recklessness." He said: "We have put
the affected areas such as Birchenough Bridge, Chimanimani, and Zimunya
under quarantine to be waived depending on the situation."

[The further spread of FMD in Zimbabwe is not surprising in view of the
unstable political and economical situation prevailing in the country,
which does not permit efficient implementation of animal movement control
and quarantine measures. As previously reported, the situation is
characterized by drought, smuggling, and the sale of cattle by commercial
farmers who lost their land under the government's land redistribution
programme. Obviously, this epidemiological situation is causing serious
concerns in the neighbouring countries as well.
The prospects of containing the outbreak might be considered realistic only
if sufficient quantities of the required multivalent vaccines and
appropriate transportation for the vaccinating teams become available. In
previous postings it was said that 340 000 doses of vaccine have been
received from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), a quantity that
"will only cover 10 percent of the up to 3.4 million doses needed to
vaccinate all the animals at risk of contracting the disease". - Mod.AS]
