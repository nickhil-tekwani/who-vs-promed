Chikungunya [virus] has popped up once again in Thiruvananthapuram, especially in the coastal belt. According to sources, 10 chikungunya cases were reported from the coastal region of Anchuthengu alone where over 500 cases of fever have been reported in the past 2 weeks.

The district medical officer told TOI that blood samples would be collected from this area on Monday [12 Mar 2012] and sent for testing to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for confirmation.

Chikungunya [virus infection] cases came to light when samples collected from this area by the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) tested positive. Sources said that of the 20 odd samples collected, 10 had tested positive [positive for antibody or for virus? - Mod.TY].

"The fever is spreading. The district medical administration has been holding medical camps here at regular intervals. Even on Thursday [8 Mar 2012], our team was there following the RGCB findings. However, symptoms of chikungunya [virus infection] have not been found here. Anyway, we have decided to send the samples to the Pune institute for detailed examination," said Dr Peethambaran, DMO.

He said health workers were on the vigil in the region and were constantly reporting from the field. "It is a fact that the fever is spreading, but there is no fear of an outbreak," the DMO said.

According to health workers manning Anchuthengu, people cutting across all age groups have been affected by the fever. Fear also looms large, as 3 years ago this region was badly affected by chikungunya.

"We have strengthened our activities for source reduction and have provided adequate quantities of drugs to be distributed in the area. We are also in the process of finding the density of mosquitoes here," said the DMO.

[This area is likely endemic for chikungunya virus. Concern about the spread is justified because although the case fatality rate is extremely low or nil, morbidity can be high. The severe arthralgia from the infection can be incapacitating, and in some cases may last for weeks or months after the acute infection. Last year (2011) there were many reports of chikungunya virus infections from various parts of India (cited in the see also section below), including Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala state in December 2011. There is no commercially available vaccine for chikungunya virus, so mosquito vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available.
