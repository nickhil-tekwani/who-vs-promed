Pink eye outbreak spreads in Xiamen City (Fujian province)
----------------------------------------------------------
Recently, many people in Xiamen are suffering
from viral conjunctivitis, commonly known as
"pink eye," and half of the infected persons are
students [i.e., school children], Xiamen Business
Newspaper reported. Many hospitals in Xiamen
admitted more than 50 infected persons every day.

Schools in Jimei District and Haicang District
have canceled doing eye exercises [see below]
temporarily, said the report. According to the
experts, doing eye exercises may cause
cross-infection among students and the peak
season of "pink eye" incidence is autumn. But the
epidemic can be contained if people are vigilant about personal hygiene.

A public warning has been issued by China's
hygiene and disease control department about the outbreak.

[Conjunctivitis is a common eye condition
worldwide. It causes inflammation (swelling) of
the conjunctiva -- the thin layer that lines the
inside of the eyelid and covers the white part of
the eye. Conjunctivitis is often called "pink
eye" or "red eye" because it can cause the white
of the eye to take on a pink or red color.

The most common causes of conjunctivitis are
viruses, bacteria, and allergens. Viral
conjunctivitis can be caused by a number of
different viruses, many of which are associated
with an upper respiratory tract infection, cold,
or sore throat. Viral conjunctivitis spreads
easily and rapidly between people and can result
in epidemics. It is typically mild, with symptoms
being the worst on days 3Â­5 of infection.

The condition usually clears up in 7-14 days
without treatment and resolves without any
long-term effects. In some cases, it can take 2-3
weeks or more for viral conjunctivitis to
completely clear up, depending on whether
complications develop [For further information,
see: <http://www.cdc.gov/conjunctivitis/about/causes.html#a>].

The text of the Xiamen News report is accompanied
by a charming photograph of school children doing
"eye exercises." During eye exercises the eyes
may be closed and massaged with circular
movements of the fingers for 1-2 minutes, which
provides an opportunity for infection of the eyes
if hand washing has been neglected.

Xiamen is a coastal city located in the Chinese
province of of Fujian
