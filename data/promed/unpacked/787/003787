The Utah state veterinarian's office has now confirmed 9 equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) cases, according to an 11 Mar 2013 statement.

"The state veterinarian's office is restricting the movement of the infected animals as a precaution to prevent the spread of the disease," the statement read. "The outbreak remains confined to Cache County, as there have been no other reports of EHV-1 clinical signs in horses in other areas of the state. Nonetheless, horse owners throughout Utah are advised to take extra biosecurity precautions when taking their animals to shows or public arenas."

The outbreak began on 26 Feb 2013 when 2 horses tested positive for the disease; 2 additional horses were confirmed to be EHV-1 positive the following day.

On 4 Mar 2013, officials announced that 2 more horses had tested positive for the disease, and by 6 Mar 2013, the case count had risen to 7. 4 of the affected horses have been euthanized as a result of the disease, the 11 Mar 2013 statement read.

The statement also noted that the Cache County Fairgrounds Horse Arena has closed until further notice because most of the horses had been at the facility recently. "Horse owners who have taken their animals to the Cache County Fairgrounds Arena during the past 30 days should monitor their horse's temperature and report concerns to their local veterinarian," the statement read.

"The state veterinarian recommends that horse facilities proceed with planned equine events and that horse owners planning on traveling to an event should take their horse's temperature daily, beginning 3 days prior to travel and daily during the event," the statement read.

"Horses with temperatures of 103 deg F [39.4 deg C] and above should not travel or mingle with other horses. Horses should be isolated for 2 weeks after returning home from an event, during which time they should be monitored for disease signs."

Statewide, no other horses have shown signs of EHV-1; however, the state veterinarian's office is advising Utah horse owners to take extra security measures to prevent unnecessary contact with possibly infected horses and to quickly report clinical signs to their veterinarian.

Equine herpesvirus-1 is highly contagious among horses and camelids and is generally spread via aerosol transmission (when infected animals sneeze and cough) and through contact with nasal secretions from infected animals. The disease can cause a variety of problems in horses, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form). Fever, ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the hind limbs, and incontinence are signs of EHM. If a horse that has possibly been exposed to EHV-1 begins to display any of the aforementioned signs, call your veterinarian immediately.

A horse virus outbreak has some area stables on lockdown, while others are monitoring the situation closely after horses recently fell ill at a Gurnee stable.

The virus -- EHV-1 -- is a highly contagious equine illness that can cause neurological impairment and even death. It's particularly dangerous to foals, geriatric horses, and can cause miscarriage, said Meggan Hill-McQueeney, president and COO [chief operating officer] of BraveHearts Theraputic Riding and Educational Center.

At BraveHearts' locations in Poplar Grove and Harvard, barns are under quarantine -- meaning no new horses are being brought into the facility. The virus can be spread from horse to horse by humans when they put on halters and bridles, Hill-McQueeney said, so volunteers and staff members have been urged to be diligent about hand washing. Anyone with their own barn is being asked to change their clothes before coming into the BraveHearts facilities. [They should also change clothes before going back to their own barn. - Mod.TG]

The Fox Valley Saddle Association [FVSA] closed down its stables after hearing of the outbreak. This note was posted on the website: "In light of the recent outbreak of the EHV-1 in Gurnee, Illinois, and the subsequent quarantine of that facility, the Fox Valley Saddle Association Board held an emergency meeting on Friday evening, 8 Mar 2013. Based on the information available it was decided that it is in Fox Valley Saddle Association's and the horse community's best interest to lock down our facility until further notice ... The gate locks were changed on 8 Mar 2013 and neither the indoor nor the clubhouse will be in use. On our 21 Mar 2013 meeting we will determine if it is prudent to reopen the grounds." An event this week at Gurnee-based Fields and Fences School of Horsemanship was rescheduled due to an outbreak at a nearby stable, according to its website.

Additional precautions being taken at BraveHearts include taking horses' temperatures daily -- as fever is an early indicator of illness. "The main thing is knowing your horses and what's typical for them and what's not typical," Hill-McQueeney said. "Be aware if they have a persistent cough or nasal discharge or if they do have a fever or are more lethargic. Those are things they definitely would want to watch carefully."

It is critical to keep a close watch on your animals. This is a nasty and frequently fatal disease. High temperature is an early warning sign and if the body temperature of the animal goes up without the horse having been exercised, call the veterinarian immediately.
