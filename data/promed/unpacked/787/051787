Japan: Five People May Have Contracted Avian Influenza Virus Infection
----------------------------------------------------------------------
TOKYO: Four employees of an avian influenza virus contaminated poultry farm
and one person who helped disinfect the facility may have contracted avian
influenza virus infection during an outbreak early this year in Japan, the
government stated on Sat 18 Dec 2004. If confirmed, the cases would mark
the first human cases of avian influenza virus infection in Japan.
The five were based in rural Kyoto state, about 230 miles west of Tokyo.
Researchers found antibodies to avian influenza virus in blood samples
taken from the five in February and March, but were unable to determine if
any of them had actually contracted the disease, the Health Ministry said
in a statement. The Ministry plans to issue a more detailed report on Wed
22 Dec 2004.
Avian influenza has swept through farms across Asia this year, forcing
officials to cull more than 100 million birds. The disease also jumped to
humans, killing 12 people in Thailand and 20 in Vietnam. There is no
concrete evidence of human-to-human transmission, but experts fear the
virus could mutate to a form that could spread among humans, sparking a
global pandemic.

[Although it is not stated it must be assumed that it has been determined
that the infection contracted by the Japanese poultry workers was caused by
the highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus responsible for the
current extensive outbreak in East Asia. It appears that the five poultry
workers were exposed to avian influenza virus during an outbreak in Feb/Mar
2004 and suffered no significant illness, unlike the cases reported from
Thailand and Viet Nam where there was severe disease and a high mortality
(73%). The information released so far suggests that the five poultry
workers may have been exposed to virus antigen and developed a detectable
immune response, but may not have contracted virus infection. Further
information is awaited.
