Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species.
Epidemiological comment: the outbreak reported in the immediate notification included 3 farms and has now been updated; the new outbreaks in this report concern 2 of the 3 farms previously mentioned. A 25-km [15.5 mi] buffer zone has been established around the outbreaks where the following measures have been taken:
1. Vaccination and booster vaccination of animals are recommended. Primary vaccination has been applied so far in 24 871 animals. The Livestock Services keep track of doses requested and of farmers concerned.
2. Epidemiological investigations were carried out in the holdings in the buffer zone (Cerro Largo and Rivera Departments). In these holdings, data were collected on the presence of bats, their stray behavior, their shelters, whether there are hills, mountains or places favourable for _Desmodus rotundus_ habitat, the presence of animals bitten by _Desmodus rotundus_ or of animals with myiasis as well as animals with neurological signs. Also, they were asked whether their animals had been vaccinated. It was concluded that in the buffer zone 285 farmers in Cerro Largo and 3 in Rivera were concerned (109 046 cattle, 45 297 sheep, 3734 horses, 463 swine). In the zone only 2 farms with animals having been bitten and 2 new shelters, not yet registered by the team in charge of capturing bats, were found. On [5 Apr 2014], the teams in charge of capturing bats within the Livestock Services began to work in the buffer zone in order to: a) find new shelters, b) georeference them, c) assess the health status of the _Desmodus rotundus_ colonies in the zone, d) control the _Desmodus rotundus_ population in the shelters. Up to date 3 additional new shelters have been found and the population is being reduced. Georeferenced points of vampire bats niches have begun to be registered on the SISA website (Animal Health Information Systems) and shared with the MSP (Ministry of Public Health) and Brazilian Services. The MSP is vaccinating technicians from Field and Laboratory Veterinary Services in Cerro Largo, Rivera, and Treinta y Tres with pre-exposure and post-exposure vaccines. The Zoonosis Committee continues vaccinating in the outbreak zone and around and has vaccinated so far 95 dogs and 5 cats.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs; movement control inside the country; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s);

[It is great to know that vaccinations are under way. I wonder if there is any deforestation occurring that may force the bats into the more populated area?
