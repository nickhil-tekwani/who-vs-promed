[1] Afghanistan, 2 new cases - media report
Date: Sun 1 Sep 2019

Two new polio cases have surfaced separately in capital city of Tirinkot and Chora district of southern Uruzgan [Oruzgan] province, a statement from the relevant ministry said [Sun 1 Sep 2019].

A 30-month-old child and another 6-month-old infant were permanently paralyzed as a result of the polio virus.

According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), the total number of polio cases in 2019 reached 15 with the 2 new cases, saying all of these cases had been reported from inaccessible areas.

"Of the 15 polio cases this year [2019], 14 have been reported from the southern region of Afghanistan,' the statement said, adding "7 positive cases came from [Oruzgan], 5 from Helmand, and 2 other from Kandahar."

Only 1 out of 12 polio cases was reported from eastern Kunar province while the rest happened in the southern zone.

"Access to health services is the right of every citizen of the country," said Dr Ferozuddin Feroz, the Minister of Public Health. "We are deeply concerned about the increasing polio cases and the number of children who still don't have consistent and proper access to vaccination," he added.

He said the virus could spread further in the country and more children would be affected and paralyzed by polio virus.

He called upon people to 'work together and protect innocent children against polio and facilitate a safe and secure environment for our frontline workers in order to enable them administer vaccine drops to children in every nook and cranny of the country."

Polio is a crippling and potentially fatal infectious disease. There is no cure and the vaccine is the only safe and effective way to protect children.

The polio vaccine is safe and harmless for newborn children whether they are sick or not. It is very important that newborns and sick children get the vaccine because they may have lower immunity which makes them more susceptible to the virus.

Polio vaccination has also been strongly endorsed by national and global Islamic scholars.

[As I mentioned in the moderator comment of the last post (Poliomyelitis update (71): global (Pakistan, Congo DR) 20190901.6651501), "While there have been no newly confirmed cases reported from Afghanistan this week nor have there been positive environmental samples reported from either Pakistan or Afghanistan, it doesn't mean the virus is not still circulating, just that there aren't new confirmations." Unfortunately there were cases under investigation.

As correctly stated in the media report above, the addition of these 2 newly confirmed cases brings the number of confirmed WPV1 cases reported by Afghanistan during 2019 to date to 15.

Oruzgan is located in the central part of Afghanistan, sharing southern and southwestern borders with Kandahar and Helmand provinces where other polio cases have been reported this year (2019) as well (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/afghanistan_admin-2009.jpg).

[2] Philippines, VDPV positive environmental sample - media report

The Department of Health (DOH) on [Sat 31 Aug 2019] appealed to parents to have their children vaccinated against polio, after a test on Manila's sewage showed the existence of the virus that causes the debilitating disease.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said a recent sampling of Manila's sewage tested positive for the vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV), which the World Health Organization (WHO) defined in its website as "an excreted vaccine-virus that can continue to circulate for an extended period of time."

No transmissions yet
--------------------
"The longer it is allowed to survive, the more genetic changes it undergoes. In very rare instances, the vaccine-virus can genetically change into a form that can paralyze -- this is what is known as a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV)," WHO said in its website (http://who.int/features/qa/64/en/).

Duque said that while there are no recorded transmissions yet, parents should ensure that their children are protected since the virus is already in the environment.

"We repeat our call to parents and caregivers: Let us prioritize the complete vaccination of our children so they remain safe from vaccine-preventable diseases, like polio," the health secretary said at a press conference.

"We need to make sure that the polio vaccine coverage should be at 95 percent to ensure that this will not create problems to our children," Duque said.

There is no cure for the disease, he added. "Complete vaccination is the best way to prevent it," he said.

The Philippines since 2016 has been falling short of the ideal immunization coverage rate of 95 percent. Coverage was at 68 percent in 2016, increasing slightly to 71 percent the next year, but dropping again to 66 percent in 2018.

A fatal and disabling disease, polio is transmitted through the fecal-oral route, especially where there's poor personal hygiene and environmental sanitation. It mostly affects children below 15.

Polio-free since 2000
Apart from the latest disclosure by Duque, the Philippines has been certified polio-free since 2000 by the DOH.

Given that VDPV was found in the city of Manila, Duque called on local governments to intensify the implementation of their zero open-defecation program as well as to strengthen their efforts to ensure good personal hygiene and sanitation.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention described VDPV as a "strain of the weakened poliovirus that was initially included in oral polio vaccine (OPV) and that has changed over time and behaves more like the wild or naturally occurring virus."

"This means it can be spread more easily to people who are unvaccinated against polio and who come in contact with the stool or respiratory secretions, such as from a sneeze, of an infected person," the CDC said.

Given that sewage usually end up in Manila Bay, Duque said it "remains unsafe for swimming."

As part of its efforts to ensure that no child is left unvaccinated, the DOH is currently conducting an immunization drive for polio aimed at covering 5.5 million children in the National Capital Region, Central Luzon, and Calabarzon.

"The vaccination is free and will be administered by giving a child 2 drops of OPV [oral poliovirus vaccines] by mouth. OPV has been used in the country since 1980," Duque said.

[The good news is that the Philippines are doing environmental monitoring for polioviruses. The not so good news is that with falling vaccination coverages over the past few years, there is now a vaccine derived poliovirus found in sewage sampling of the major metropolis of Manila with a population of approximately 24.7 million people in 2018, the 8th largest metropolitan area in the world. As of the present, there have not been confirmed cases of cVDPV identified among AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases in the Philippines....but will it remain that way???
