Investigations following a death from anthrax
---------------------------------------------
Following the announcement of the death of a patient from inhalation
anthrax the Health Protection Agency (HPA) have been carrying out
testing at the patient's workshop in Hackney, where animal skin drums
were made. Testing was carried out to see whether there were traces
of anthrax at the property and if any specialist cleaning was needed
before it could be used again. Samples were taken from the property
on Tuesday [4 Nov 2008] and tested at the Agency's specialist
laboratories in Porton Down.

Results from these samples confirmed that anthrax was found on one of
5 drums in the property and also on some animal skins. No traces of
anthrax were found in the other samples, which were taken from a wide
variety of places within the property.

Dr Brian McCloskey, director of the Agency in the London Region said,
"These results mean that we will not need to carry out wide scale
specialist cleaning at the property. We have already taken the animal
skins away and will be removing the drum early next week [week of 17
Nov 2008]. We will then carry out some final checks and if all is
well we will be able to hand the keys back to the owner. We have
informed all residents of the local area about these results and have
thanked them for their patience during this investigation"

Notes to editors
----------------
1. For further information please contact the London press office on
0207 759 2824.
2. Anthrax is a disease caused by spores that live in the
environment. It can cause a skin infection (cutaneous anthrax) or as
in this case, inhalation anthrax, when the spores are inhaled into
the lungs. Inhalation anthrax is very rare and is not passed from
person to person. All individuals who may have been exposed to
anthrax spores during the making of these drums have already been
given antibiotics to prevent them from becoming ill.
3. Despite the popularity of African drumming in the UK and elsewhere
over recent years, cases of anthrax associated with these activities
are very rare.
4. A single case of cutaneous (skin) anthrax associated with a goat
hide bongo drum purchased in Haiti occurred in 1974: this is the only
such case ever reported. Since then rare cases of cutaneous anthrax
have occurred as a result of making drums from untanned animal hides.
5. A case of inhalation anthrax occurred in 2006 in America in a man
who made drums from dried (but otherwise untreated) animal hides
brought in from West Africa. A recent case occurred in Scotland in
2006 in a man who made and played drums from imported animal hides.
6. Anthrax infections associated with the handling of untanned animal
hides are now extremely rare in the UK. Imported animal hides from
countries where anthrax is endemic in animals (for example, in Africa
and Asia) pose a higher risk for exposure than domestic (UK origin) hides.
7. Strict regulations are in place for the importation of animal
hides. These can be accessed at

[Two questions remain
1. Did the affected drum maker ever transfer any spores on his
working clothes when he returned to his flat/apartment at the end of
the day? This is not unknown.
2. Considering the numbers of contaminated West African goat skins
that must have made their way to the UK (and the US) what triggered
this inhalation case, and the ones in Scotland and New York, and not
others? It would be difficult to believe that just 3 hides initiated
these 3 cases, a 100 percent attack rate. Put another way, if that is
held to be the case West Africa must be swamped with inhalation
anthrax but we get few reports of human anthrax from there, and those
are routine cutaneous or gastro-enteric cases. What increased the
risk for these fellows? Smoking? Chronic lung problems? HIV? Upper
respiratory infection as in a 'cold'? Unfit, so heavy breathing on
any effort? Diabetic? Poor workshop ventilation?
