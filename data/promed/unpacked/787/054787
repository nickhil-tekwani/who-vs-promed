The number of cases of Q fever reported among humans in the
Netherlands has risen 'explosively' over the past few weeks, the
Volkskrant reports on Wednesday [6 May 2009]. The paper says over 200
cases have been reported in recent days, half of them in
Noord-Brabant province.

Q fever was rarely known among humans in the Netherlands until 2007,
when 168 cases were reported. In 2008, there were more than 1000
infections in the Netherlands.

The infection is spread by livestock, which shed the bacteria in
urine, feces, birth products, and milk. The bacteria can reach humans
after feces and dirty straw are used as fertilizer and blown about,
the Volkskrant says. The disease, which leads to spontaneous abortion
in sheep and goats, causes flu-like symptoms in humans but can lead
to lung infections.

[The pathogenic organism of Q fever, often acquired by close exposure
to animals, is infectious with a very low inoculum and may be
aerosolized over a distance. It is not clear what contact the
infected people had with animals or how close they were to farms.

_Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937.
This organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and
desiccation, and is highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single
inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human]
primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of the primates was found to be
1.7 organisms (1).

Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.
Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals,
including other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C.
burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals,
although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_
infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of
infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are
shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta.
Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).

The organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common
disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long
periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is
associated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are
produced during standard replication along with the less resistant
large cell form, metabolically dormant, and spore-like (3).

Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms
from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried
placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd
animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very
few organisms may be required to cause infection.

Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and
inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of
transmission. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick
bites and human-to-human transmission, are rare.
