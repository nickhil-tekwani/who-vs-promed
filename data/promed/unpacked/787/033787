G Crameri, PA Durr, J Barr, et al. 2015. Absence of MERS-CoV antibodies in feral camels in Australia: implications for the pathogen's origin and spread, One Health (2015), doi:10.1016/j.onehlt.2015.10.003
------------------------------------
Abstract. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections continue to be a serious emerging disease problem internationally with well over 1000 cases and a major outbreak outside of the Middle East region. While the hypothesis that dromedary camels are the likely major source of MERS-CoV infection in humans is gaining acceptance, conjecture continues over the original natural reservoir host(s) and specifically the role of bats in the emergence of the virus. Dromedary camels were imported to Australia, principally between 1880 and 1907 and have since become a large feral population inhabiting extensive parts of the continent. Here we report that during a focussed surveillance study, no serological evidence was found for the presence of MERS-CoV in the camels in the Australian population. This finding presents various hypotheses about the timing of the emergence and spread of MERS-CoV throughout populations of camels in Africa and Asia, which can be partially resolved by testing sera from camels from the original source region, which we have inferred was mainly northwestern Pakistan. In addition, we identify bat species which overlap (or neighbour) the range of the Australian camel population with a higher likelihood of carrying CoVs of the same lineage as MERS-CoV. Both of these proposed follow-on studies are examples of "proactive surveillance", a concept that has particular relevance to a One Health approach to emerging zoonotic diseases with a complex epidemiology and aetiology.

Conclusion. At a 1st glance, it might seem that assessing the sero-status of feral camels, and the presence of CoVs in bats with potential contact with these camels has little relevance to understanding the epidemiology and evolution of MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula. However, such are the complexities of the virus and the disease that many key discoveries have been made by examining animals at the margin of the problem areas. The initial discovery that camels might be the principal reservoir of MERS-CoV arose following exploratory testing of camel serum collected from the Canary Islands, which then led onto a more systematic survey of camels from the Arabian Peninsula [38]. Similarly, the discovery of a plausible ancestor virus to MERS-CoV arose from the sampling of a bat species in South Africa, even though the species does not occur within the Arabian Peninsula [16, 39]. The important lesson from these examples is that when dealing with an emerging infectious disease with a complex epidemiology, conventional outbreak investigations may not resolve key questions, and thus there is a need for studies which might appear tangential. Some of these, as in the examples cited, might result in important discoveries, but it needs to be accepted that most will not. However, we argue that within the context of "proactive surveillance", then negative survey results can be immensely important in directing attention to where effort is needed, which in our example, is our recommendation for a follow-on sero-survey in western Asia.

[The natural reservoir host(s) of MERS-CoV have not yet been definitely identified. Furthermore, it is not known how different strains of virus are transmitted to humans. Closely related viruses and virus-neutralising antibodies have been found in dromedary camels leading to the hypothesis that camels are likely to be the major reservoirs of MERS-CoV and camel-to-human transmission the main route of infection in humans. However, it is presently not clear whether MERS-CoV was introduced into the camel populations recently or whether it has adapted to camels as a natural reservoir from ancient times. This study takes one step towards addressing this question. - Mod.LK]

The Minister of Health, Khaleed Al Falih, denied that his ministry has culled camel flocks and the allegation that they are prosecuting camel owners, adding that he himself is still eating camel meat and drinking camel milk.

This statement was delivered at a press conference held last [Sun 8 Nov 2015] in Riyadh, following a cooperation agreement between the Ministry of Health, the King Abdelaziz University (Science and Technology), and the Ministry of Agriculture.

The agreement aims at promoting research on _Coronavirus_, and it is said to have an open budget. This will augment the about 400 research [projects] already underway on the virus.

[More than 3 years after its initial discovery, MERS-CoV continues its circulation in the Arab Peninsula, with rather limited progress made on its control and prevention in humans and with holes remaining in knowledge of its epidemiology, in particular its reservoir. Controversial statements and unrealistic data ("400 research [projects]") are still being published, while the practical handling of the continuing issue, particularly in Saudi Arabia, needs enhanced investigative effort and, indeed, a "One Health" approach.

OIE established an ad-hoc experts group on MERS-CoV infection in animals. To the best of our knowledge, the group's last meeting took place in Paris in July 2014. Following the meeting, OIE published, in August 2014, an update of its Q&A regarding MERS-CoV in animals (see posting 20140818.2700879; the document is available at http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/update-august-2014-questions-answers-on-middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers-cov/).

Subscribers are invited to read the following 6 main articles in the report of the ad-hoc meeting in Paris from 15-17 Jul 2014 http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Internationa_Standard_Setting/docs/pdf/SCAD/A_SCAD_Sept2014.pdf (annex 16, page 129-133).

"1. Current state of knowledge about MERS-CoV in humans and animals
-------------------------------------
The experts from the World Health Organization (WHO), University of Hong Kong, and Erasmus Medical Centre, the Netherlands, presented the latest information on the disease situation in humans, findings from epidemiological studies in camels, scientific data on the performance of diagnostic tests, and outputs from research studies done in collaboration with Member Countries. Representatives from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia presented plans for epidemiological studies in animals.

The Group noted that data from serological studies indicated that MERS-CoV infection of camels had been widespread across North Africa; that camels with high titres of antibodies to MERS-CoV had been reported to shed virus; that virus had been detected in nasal and oral secretions, in faeces, and in milk of camels (and that for milk samples testing positive, the possibility of cross contamination could not be ruled out). It was also noted that accurate serology and PCR tests were available for MERS-CoV and that several MERS-CoV lineages existed.

2. Review of current public health guidance
--------------------------------
The WHO representative presented the current General Recommendations on MERS-CoV transmission from animals to humans and interim recommendations for at risk groups [available in annex III, pages 137-138 at the above URL], explaining that in the absence of having a full understanding on the exact route of transmission from camels to humans, the recommendations were based on basic hygiene principles; where possible, available evidence from ongoing studies were considered in developing this guidance.

The Group was supportive of the recommendations and agreed that they should be regularly reviewed to account for new evidence. The Group also suggested that the recommendations specific to MERS-CoV should apply to countries where there was a risk of transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans.

3. Guidance on:
--------------
a) A case definition for MERS-CoV infection in animals
In accordance with Article 1.1.3.e) of the Terrestrial Code (Version 2013), Member Countries are obliged to notify the occurrence of any emerging disease with significant morbidity, mortality, or zoonotic potential in their territories even though the pathogen is not included in the OIE List of Diseases. Detections of MERS-CoV in animals were considered to be reportable to the OIE owing to their zoonotic potential, even though there had been no evidence of any significant disease in animals. The Group agreed that serological positive results from animals indicated previous infection with MERS-CoV and that positive serology findings should be further investigated with virological sampling. Virological positive results (by PCR or virus identification) in samples taken from camels or other animals should be reported to the OIE as an emerging disease with zoonotic potential [Notably, Saudi Arabia remains the only affected country in the Arab peninsula which has not reported MERS-CoV in camels to the OIE to the present day. - Mod.AS].

b) Surveillance for MERS-CoV in camels
The Group agreed that for the topic under discussion, the term "epidemiologic studies" may be more appropriate than "surveillance," because there was not a defined systematic approach to sampling, neither were there any animal health control measures to be implemented on positive findings.

The Group agreed that the epidemiologic studies should take into account the principles for Animal Health Surveillance described in Chapter 1.4 of the OIE Terrestrial Code.

The objectives of MERS-CoV epidemiologic studies in camels were driven by concern over the public health implications and should focus on:
- determining whether MERS-CoV infections were present in camels in a country, holding, or camel population;
- assessing the risk profile of a country;
- assessing public health risk and management measures;
- monitoring strains and lineages of MERS-CoV circulating in camel populations.

The Group recommended that there was benefit in sampling camels from different industry sectors within a country e.g. racing, dairy, meat, show camels. Sampling could also be targeted to account for age groups and points of camel gathering (races, markets, slaughterhouses). Evidence suggested that serological surveillance should focus on older camels (older than 2 years) and virological studies should focus on younger camels (less than 2 years old). Epidemiological studies should also aim to gather and generate data on basic epidemiologic characteristics (incubation period, shedding period etc.) and risk factors for infection.

The Group also highlighted the critical importance of investigating significant morbidity and mortality events in camels (and other species of animals) where the cause was unknown.

The Group strongly endorsed the recommendation of the OIE ad hoc Group on camelid diseases "to include veterinary counterparts in the investigation of human and animal MERS cases in the field."

c) Surveillance for MERS-CoV in other animal species if relevant
The Group suggested that in countries where MERS-CoV is present in camels, studies to assess the presence of MERS-CoV in wild and other domestic species can be conducted to detect possible infection in other hosts and to contribute to understanding the origins of the virus.

d) Appropriate guidance on action, if any, to be taken on positive surveillance findings in animals
The Group recommended that the general public health recommendations (Annex III) of the World Health Organisation (WHO) should be implemented when animals were confirmed as being virological positive for MERS-CoV. [pages 137-138 in the document].

e) Appropriate science-based animal health management measures to limit potential for further human infections
The Group highlighted that there was currently not enough evidence to make specific recommendations about possible animal health management measures. However in the future when more evidence became available it may be possible to propose disease management procedures and interventions to reduce transmission within the camel population and to propose science-based recommendations to mitigate the risk at the human-animal interface.

f) Communications strategy including updating of Questions and Answers (Q and A) on the OIE website and fact sheet for multiple audiences
The Group reviewed and amended the current OIE Q and A on MERS-CoV reflecting the latest scientific knowledge. It was also recommended that the Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases, with the help of the OIE Scientific and Technical Department, compose an OIE Fact Sheet on MERS similar to other fact sheets currently on the OIE Website.

4. Recommendations on further research studies in animals
---------------------------------
The Group discussed the importance of conducting further epidemiologic and research studies aimed at better understanding the behaviour of MERS-CoV infections in animals, and identifying measures to reduce risks to public and animal health. The Group endorsed the previous recommendations of the OIE ad hoc Group on camelid diseases relating to research activities and identified an updated list of research priorities as follows:

- To further develop and validate user-friendly diagnostic tests for MERS-CoV as fit for purpose for surveillance of infections in animal populations (live animals and at slaughter).
- Comparative epidemiological studies, in all countries with significant camel populations, to determine the prevalence, distribution, and demographics of MERS-CoV infections in camels in different settings
- Studies to characterise the clinical and pathological effects, kinetics of virus shedding, and immune response to MERS-CoV in experimentally and naturally infected camels
- Studies to assess risk factors and potential exposure sources for camel infection and the relationship between camel infections and human cases of MERS
- Studies to investigate and assess the potential effectiveness of intervention measures aimed at reducing public health risk
- Conduct genetic analyses of both MERS-CoV and infected hosts from different geographical areas to gain a better understanding of the properties of MERS-CoV and to monitor evolution of the virus
- Presence, viability and survival of MERS-CoV in different animal products and the environment
- Research on immunology and vaccine development
- Identification and evaluation of socioeconomic factors that are associated with risk of MERS-CoV infection in camel populations
- Assess potential socioeconomic impact of the MERS-CoV infections, and interventions and control strategies in camels, including on trade
- Studies to obtain an insight into culturally acceptable risk reduction measures
- Studies to determine the original animal source of the virus, including wildlife

5. Recommendations concerning solicitation of interest for possible establishment of an OIE Reference centre
----------------------------------
The Group was informed that the OIE had already received requests from OIE Member Countries to establish an OIE Reference Centre of expertise for MERS-CoV. The Group noted the mandate of OIE Reference Laboratories and OIE Collaborating Centres and agreed that the establishment of an OIE Reference Centre with expertise in MERS-CoV would be helpful in supporting further disease surveillance and research, as well as providing technical advice to the OIE Member Countries. Experts from institutes, including WHO Reference Centres, recognised to have relevant expertise were encouraged to apply for OIE Reference Centre status.

It was noted that whilst current available diagnostic tests were accurate and fit for purpose for animal surveillance they had not yet been validated according to OIE Standards for validation of diagnostic assays for infectious diseases. The Group agreed that an OIE Reference Centre could also undertake such validation work, in close collaboration with the OIE ad hoc Group on camelid diseases and the Biological Standards Commission."

6. Evaluation on whether MERS-CoV infection in camels should be an OIE listed disease
-------------------------
The President of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Standards Commission explained the criteria for inclusion of diseases, infections and infestations on the OIE list and the rationale for doing so. The Group reviewed each criterion (described in Chapter 1.2 of the Terrestrial Code) against current data on MERS-CoV.

1) International spread of the agent (via live animals or their products, vectors or fomites) has been proven.
The Group decided that although it was plausible that camels may have spread MERS-CoV infections internationally (and there was some genetic and field evidence to suggest that international spread had occurred), it had not yet been sufficiently proven that MERS-CoV had been spread internationally by camels or their products. Potential routes of spread other than camels could not be ruled out.
AND
2) At least one country has demonstrated freedom or impending freedom from the disease, infection or infestation in populations of susceptible animals, based on the animal health surveillance provisions of the Terrestrial Code, in particular those contained in Chapter 1.4.

The Group agreed that no country had yet carried out systematic surveillance in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 1.4 of the Terrestrial Code to demonstrate freedom of MERS-CoV from animal populations. However it was recognised that some countries, with small camel populations, may be able to demonstrate freedom from their camel populations relatively easily if they implement the prescribed surveillance guidelines to do so (AHG MERS-CoV infection in animals/July 2014 Annex 16 (contd.)
Scientific Commission/September 2014 133),
AND
3a) Natural transmission to human has been proven, and human infection is associated with severe consequences.
The Group agreed that evidence from epidemiologic studies (including case control studies) and outbreak investigations suggested that natural transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans had occurred, and that MERS-CoV had been demonstrated to cause severe disease in humans.

3b) The disease has been shown to cause significant morbidity or mortality in domestic animals at the level of a country or zone.
The Group agreed that significant morbidity or mortality in domestic animals had not been attributed to MERS-CoV infection. However the Group recommended that further studies were needed to assess the pathogenicity and prevalence of MERS-CoV infections in camels.

3c) The disease has been shown to, or scientific evidence indicates that it would, cause significant morbidity or mortality in wild animal populations.
The Group agreed that significant morbidity and mortality in wild animals had not been attributed to MERS-CoV infection.

4) A reliable means of detection and diagnosis exists and a precise case definition is available to clearly identify cases and allow them to be distinguished from other diseases, infections and infestations.
The Group agreed that although there is no clear clinical syndrome in camels, accurate molecular and serological diagnostic techniques were available to detect past and current infections of MERS-CoV in camels.

In conclusion, the Group decided that based on available scientific evidence, infections with MERS-CoV in camels did not meet the criteria for an OIE listed disease. However, the Group emphasised that MERS-CoV was a serious public health problem with zoonotic potential and that infection in animals should remain reportable to OIE as an emerging disease. The Group also recommended that the status of MERS-CoV should be kept under review. More data should be collected by Member Countries, and generated by research, to provide evidence for science-based recommendations, particularly in relation to whether MERS-CoV should be listed. These data should include data from Member Countries on baseline surveillance in camel populations and the geographic distribution of MERS-CoV infections."

It will be interesting to note whether the ad-hoc group plans to meet again and review the accumulated results of research undertaken since its last meeting, such as the Australian paper addressed in item 1 above.

Information on the progress attained to establish, as recommended, an "OIE Reference Centre with expertise in MERS-CoV" will be welcomed. - Mod.AS
