From: Dr. Larry L. Williams <larrylw@agr.state.ne.us>

A previous Pro-MED [ProMED-mail post indicated that Nebraska had a
suspicious [suspect anthrax case. A veterinary diagnostic laboratory has
ruled out anthrax as the causal agent. Water quality has been checked and
determined to not be the cause. At this date 16 of 122 cows have died. No
calves have been affected. Consequently, Nebraska has not had a confirmed
case of anthrax this year.
