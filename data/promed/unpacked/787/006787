The number of _Vibrio vulnificus_ cases in Florida grew by 2 this week as both Volusia and Orange Counties reported the 2nd confirmed case each. This brings the state total to 18, including 4 deaths. Counties reporting cases include Brevard, Broward, Charlotte, Citrus, Collier, Duval (2), Manatee, Marion, Orange (2), Palm Beach, Santa Rosa, Sarasota (2), Volusia (2) and Wakulla counties. Fatalities have been reported from Broward, Citrus, Palm Beach and Santa Rosa counties.

_Vibrio vulnificus_ can cause disease in those who eat contaminated, uncooked seafood or have an open wound that is exposed to warm seawater containing the bacterium. Healthy individuals typically develop a mild disease; however, _Vibrio vulnificus_ infections can be a serious concern for people who have certain chronic diseases, particularly those with chronic liver disease. In these cases, the bacterium can invade the bloodstream, causing a severe and life-threatening illness with symptoms like fever, chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock) and blistering skin lesions. _Vibrio vulnificus_ bloodstream infections are fatal about 50 percent of the time. A recent study showed that people with these pre-existing medical conditions were 80 times more likely to develop _Vibrio vulnificus_ bloodstream infections than healthy people.

[The recent data on _V. vulnificus_ in Florida is:

2008: 16 cases, 6 deaths
2009: 24 cases, 7 deaths
2010: 32 cases, 10 deaths
2011: 35 cases, 13 deaths
2012: 26 cases, 9 deaths
2013: 41 cases, 12 deaths
2014: 32 cases, 7 deaths
2015: 45 cases, 14 deaths

There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination); and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can include more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL
