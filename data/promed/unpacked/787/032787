Northern hemisphere: risk of A/Wellington/1/2004(H3N2)-like virus
-----------------------------------------------
As Americans scramble for scarce doses of flu vaccine in hopes of warding
off the respiratory bug this winter [2004-2005], the wily influenza virus
may have other plans. Through a natural process known as antigenic drift, a
new strain of influenza that can diminish the effectiveness of today's
vaccine is already emerging on the far side of the world. The emergent
strain raising questions now is known as A/Wellington, named after the New
Zealand city where it was 1st detected. "The flu season has been late this
year [2004], and it seems some people who have been vaccinated have been
hit by this changing strain," said New Zealand Health Ministry flu chief
Dr. Lance Jennings.
Like weather forecasters watching tropical storms, epidemiologists for the
World Health Organization track the ever-evolving strains of influenza. The
predominant flu virus around the globe right now is one called A/Fujian,
and the vaccine Americans are seeking today is a perfect match for it. But,
A/Wellington is gaining ground. Tests suggest that 43 percent of recent New
Zealand flu cases spring from the new strain, or variants of it.
A/Wellington has even turned up about as far from the South Pacific as is
geographically possible: in Norway.
The late season surge of A/Wellington was so worrying that the WHO, on 8
Oct 2004, recommended that next year's [2005] flu vaccine for the Southern
Hemisphere, which is shipped in March, be reformulated to protect against
it. Dr. Nancy Cox, director of the Influenza Branch at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, said there is no way of knowing whether the
A/Wellington strain will establish a beachhead in the United States this
winter. "Influenza viruses are inherently unpredictable," she said in a
telephone interview.
One reason for concern is that laboratory animal tests suggest that the
current vaccine -- which targets A/Fujian -- is about 2/3rds less effective
in stirring antibodies against A/Wellington than it is against the targeted
strain. That does not mean, Cox emphasized, that the current flu shot would
be 2/3rds less effective in actual use, should the A/Wellington strain turn
up in the United States. People who regularly receive flu shots, she said,
may have higher levels of antibody protection against influenza than the
laboratory animals. "We would not anticipate that the Wellington strain
will cause an enormous problem," she said.
Doris Bucher, a flu vaccine expert at New York Medical College in Valhalla,
N.Y., said the animal tests on A/Wellington are actually encouraging,
because they show that antibodies stirred up by today's vaccine will
inhibit the new strain. "If Wellington rushed in and took over, people
would have good protection with the current vaccine," she said. Bucher's
lab specializes in developing strains of influenza that grow well in eggs
and hence serve as the basis for each year's flu vaccine made from eggs.
The current flu vaccine is made from a strain developed by her laboratory,
and she is working right now on an A/Wellington-like strain for
manufacturers who will make next year's [2005] vaccines.
When flu vaccines are well-matched to the prevailing flu strains, the shots
can prevent flu in 70 to 90 percent of vaccinated adults, according to the
CDC. Well-matched shots may prevent flu in only 30 to 40 percent of nursing
home residents, but they can reduce the death rate from influenza and
pneumonia in that population by 80 percent. American manufacturers need a
9-month lead to produce flu vaccine. That requires flu forecasters to
predict in February what the prevailing flu strain will be November.
In February 2003, the Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related
Biological Products Advisory Committee selected a strain called A/Panama as
the target. Another strain, known as A/Fujian, was starting to emerge on
the World Health Organization's flu radar, but planners feared there was
not enough time to develop a vaccine for it. Influenza struck the United
States early and hard last year [2003]. The 1st cases turned up in early
October 2003 in Texas, and soon anxious Americans were clamoring for
vaccine, a foreshadowing of this year's [2004] flu shot frenzy.
A near-record 83 million eventually had a flu shot last fall [2003]. But,
the predominant flu strain was not A/Panama but A/Fujian, and the vaccine
was only partially effective. A Colorado study for the CDC concluded last
year's flu shots were 52 percent effective in protecting healthy adults
against flu and 38 percent effective in preventing flu among those with
health conditions putting them at higher risk.
Bucher said it is reassuring that tests are showing there is less of a
mismatch between the current flu vaccine and A/Wellington than there was
last year [2003] between A/Panama and A/Fujian. "It's nothing like the
situation we had last year,'' she said. The issue, of course, will be
academic if the A/Fujian strain predominates again this year, as it did in
the Southern Hemisphere during most of the winter season that has now ended
there. Those 61 million Americans who find the vaccine will be protected.
There is also some evidence that the A/Fujian strain, having swept across
the globe last year [2003], may have lost its punch. Despite the late
emergence of the new flu strain, influenza was unusually mild throughout
the Southern Hemisphere from May through October 2004. One reason may be
that the human population, vaccinated or not, developed its own natural
resistance to A/Fujian when it came through last winter [2003]. "There are
a number of factors that determine whether you will have a good, medium, or
bad flu year, and clearly a major factor is whether the predominant strain
happens to be the same as the one the previous year,'' said Dr. Anthony
Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases. So far, there have been only isolated cases of flu detected in
the United States at the start of this year's flu season, and all have
turned out to be A/Fujian. "Things are looking pretty good, in that
regard,'' Fauci said. "But, that doesn't mean we won't get into trouble in
November or December [2004]."
