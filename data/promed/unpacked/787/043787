A potentially fatal horse disease has been recorded in Ireland for the
first time, it emerged this evening.
The Department of Agriculture and Food confirmed the presence of Equine
Infectious Anaemia (EIA) in a small number of horses in the Meath/Kildare area.
A spokesman said investigations were continuing to determine the extent of
the infection which, in this case, is thought to have been caused by the
use of infected serum in the treatment of another equine disease.
"The department is also tracing those horses which, in the past 3 months,
have passed through those farms on which the infected animals were
located," he said. "EIA is a viral disease of horses which can cause of
range of signs, including death."
In view of the potential for mortality and given the high movement of
horses throughout the country over the past few months, the department is
advising stud owners/managers and other horse owners to have their horses
tested for any evidence of the presence of the disease.
"The general incubation period for the disease is 1 to 3 weeks."
The spokesman said the department is particularly anxious that all
reasonable steps be taken by horse owners to ensure that the department can
continue to certify horses for export, where such certification is required.
"Owners of horses are advised to keep them away from areas in which there
are likely to be large concentrations of horseflies, including wetlands and
wooded areas, until such time as they have satisfied themselves that their
horses are free of EIA," he added.
Equine Infectious Anaemia (EIA) or 'swamp fever' is a persistent viral
infection of all equines. The disease is exclusively an animal health issue
and cannot be transmitted to humans. The virus is usually transmitted
through blood-sucking insects or through the use of blood-contaminated
instruments or needles.
Horses infected with EIA virus may take up to 3 weeks to show clinical
signs of the disease, which include intermittent fever, small haemorrhages
in the mucous membranes, anaemia, dependant swelling and death.

[Because EIA can be vector-transmitted, it can be difficult to control.
Also there is very little treatment for horses that are clinically ill. A
horse may test positive for the disease and have no clinical signs, at
least for a bit. Also, foals may initially test positive if from a positive
dam, but after maternal antibodies clear, the foal may test negative. - Mod.TG]
