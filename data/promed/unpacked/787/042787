[The presence of West Nile virus (WNV) in Europe was first recorded in 1958. Since then, the virus has caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of human and equine disease, mainly in southern countries. WNV circulates in resident and migratory birds present in Europe, presumably reflecting co-evolution of virus and some avian hosts over a long period (Gould EA, Higgs S, Buckley A, Gritsun TS. Potential arbovirus emergence and implications for the United Kingdom. Emerg Infect Dis. 2006; 12(4): 549-55. doi: 10.3201/eid1204.051010), although snowy owls have been shown to be susceptible, often developing fatal disease following WNV infection (Harasym CA. West Nile virus and hemoparasites in captive snowy owls (_Bubo scandiacus_) -- management strategies to optimize survival. Can Vet J 2008 49(11): 1136-8). - Mod.PMB
