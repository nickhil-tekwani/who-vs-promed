In a press statement today (Thu 13 Aug 2015) the Sudanese health minister Mr Bahr Abu Garda announced the death of 13 people due to heat exhaustion (sunstroke) in the last 48 hours in Wadi Halfa province-Northern State. This is due to the rising temperature, which has reached 47-48 C (116.6-118.4 F), leading local authorities there to close schools and reduce working hours to 2 hours and urging the local population to stay indoors, drink large amounts of cold liquids, and avoid sun exposure.

The minister excluded [the possibility that] these deaths were caused by epidemic meningitis, adding that the entire Sudanese population from 1-30 years of age have been vaccinated against meningitis.

[The above-mentioned fatalities are part of the continuum of heat stress disorders seen these days in the MENA region. The exclusion of epidemic meningitis is of utmost importance, as the country is considered among the African epidemic meningitis belt states -- although Wadi Halfa province lies outside the geographical border zones of this belt. However, the rising temperatures may widen the belt to include it and part of lower Egypt (that is, Aswan province area). - Mod.MM

Sunstroke, heatstroke, heat exhaustion -- none of these key words yields any results in ProMED-mail's archives, but the recent weeks have brought intolerably high temperatures and high humidity to the Middle East http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/04/middle-east-swelters-in-heatwave-as-temperatures-top-50c. As the report above illustrates, excess deaths occur in extreme heat as the body's homeostatic mechanisms become overwhelmed.
