Rice diseases threatens Ayeyarwady Region
-----------------------------------------
A recent outbreak of Ufra disease is decimating rice crops in Ayeyarwady Region. Caused by a tiny nematode (_Ditylenchus angustus_) that feeds on the inner part of unemerged rice leaves, the disease initially causes the discoloration of rice plants. Infected plants have panicles with many unfilled grains lowering yields and, in severe cases, causing complete crop failure.

In 2002, it was estimated that 15 per cent of Myanmar's rice farmers were affected by the disease, but because of improper containment strategies, the number is now thought to be higher. For example, in Ayeyarwadys Myaungmya district, up to 68 per cent of farmers are thought to be affected.

This year [2014] the monsoon has unleashed widespread infestation throughout Ayeyarwady. In many cases, farmers are only able to harvest [less than one third] of [yield of] a good year.

Burning crop residue, planting short-life rice varieties and proper water management can contain Ufra. [But] farmers often lack knowledge about these measures [and] the tools to diagnose the disease. They are using costly pesticides that are not as effective as preventative measures.

The Myanmar Agriculture Service does not have the funds to make frequent visits to diagnose and respond to outbreaks of Ufra. More than 50 per cent of farmers are too close to a river to allow for proper water management.

[The rice stem nematode _Ditylenchus angustus_ infects only _Oryza_ species and a few grassy weeds. It causes "Ufra" in parts of Asia, a serious disease of deep-water rice, for example, in Bangladesh, but also occurs in irrigated and rain-fed lowland rice crops. The pathogen affects above ground parts of its host and reproduces in the leaf sheath and stalk, with at least 3 generations per growing season. Symptoms may include dark lesions on leaves, leaf distortion and seed abortion. Disease development is favoured by high humidity and total yield losses have been reported.

The nematode survives between crops coiled up in rice stubble or debris and in soil. Infested ratoons and grassy reservoir hosts also serve as inoculum for new crops. _D. angustus_ can survive desiccation for 2-6 months and has been recovered from dried seeds 3 months after harvest, becoming active again when fields are flooded.

Once stem (and other) nematodes have been established in an area, it is difficult to control or eradicate them. Disease management is usually aimed at keeping nematode levels below an economic threshold. This requires an integrated approach including phytosanitary (exclusion, disinfestation) and cultural measures (long rotations with non-host crops, water management, soil solarisation) and nematicides. However, the report above illustrates the difficulties of implementing such measures in developing countries. Rice cultivars with reduced sensitivity are being developed for some areas.
