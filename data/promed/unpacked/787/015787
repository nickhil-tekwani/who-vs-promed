[1] Tick-borne encephalitis - Moscow, imported

Although Moscow until now has remained free of the disease, a case of
tick-borne encephalitis has been recorded in the capital. However, as
on previous occasions, it has proved to be an imported case. The
victim was infected in the Kostroma region [a region which adjoins
the Moscow region. - Mod.NP].
Last year [2006], 5 imported cases were recorded in Moscow. As a
consequence, vaccination centers have been set up in the capital: for
adults at the Sklyfosovsky scientific research institute for
emergency medicine; and for children at the Fylativ Hospital for children.

[Moscow and the Moscow region are considered as safe areas for
tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease (also a tick-borne disease).
So far, all cases of tick-borne encephalitis have been imported cases
originating from more than 50 endemic territories, which include the
Tver, Yaroslavl and Vladimir areas, which all adjoin the Moscow
region. - Mod.NP]

[2] Tick-borne encephalitis - Novosibirsk

Four persons have died from tick-borne encephalitis since the
beginning of this year [2007]. The most recent case was a woman
pensioner. The Head of the Epidemiological Surveillance Unit of
Novosibirsk Rospotrebnadzor has stated that the 74-year-old woman
sustained a tick bite on 8 May 2007 and sought medical attention on
30 May 2007. She remained in hospital throughout this period
following a diagnosis of a severe form of tick-borne encephalitis.
The number of tick bites recorded in Novosibirsk has exceeded the
numbers recorded during any of the past 10 years. Epidemiologists
associate the activity of ticks with a warm winter and an increase in
the rodent population. To prevent the disease, doctors recommend
vaccination, which is available throughout the whole year.

[3] Tick-borne encephalitis - Vologda region, milk-borne

An outbreak of encephalitis has been recorded in Vologda Station. The
source of infection, as in a case in the Yaroslavl region a month
ago, was un-boiled goat milk. The Department of Healthcare has
reported that 9 people were admitted to hospital on suspicion of
[contracting tick-borne encephalitis] as a result of consumption of
un-pasteurized goat milk. This was confirmed subsequently by diagnostic tests.
All the affected were either residents of Dikaya Station or visitors.
They included a 6-year-old boy. The owner of the goat who sold the
milk has also contracted the infection. Her condition has been
assessed as serious. The other cases have been classed as moderate. A
public health notice is being distributed to the population to warn
against consumption of un-boiled milk.
Recently, the epidemic situation in the region has eased somewhat,
but this is judged to be temporary and weather-dependent. The hotter
the weather, the greater the risk of exposure to tick bites.
Recently, 15 000 doses of gamma globulin have been delivered to the
region for treatment purposes. This was the 3rd delivery of this
preparation. It is being distributed among hospitals in the region.
The supply of gamma-globulin is limited but not yet critical. The
main preparation for prophylaxis is "Anaferon," which is prescribed
for children free of charge. Adults may buy iod-antipirin in any
pharmacy in the region for prophylactic usage.

[Anaferon is an antiviral and immunomodulatory drug produced in
Russia which has been shown to have therapeutic and prophylactic
applications for upper respiratory infections in children over 6 months of age.
Iod-antipirin (1-phenyl-2, 3-dimerthyl-4 iodpyrazolon) is a
preparation available in Russia with anti-inflammatory, immune
stimulating and interferonogenic properties, which stabilizes
biological membranes and delays virus penetration into cells. It is
an active inductor of alpha and beta interferons, thereby stimulating
cellular and humoral immunity. Its antiviral activity is manifested
to greatest extent against tick-borne encephalitis virus, the
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome viruses, vesicular stomatitis
virus, influenza virus and the parainfluenza viruses. Iod-antipirin
is used principally for cure and prevention of tick-borne
encephalitis in adults and in the treatment of hemorrhagic fever with
renal syndrome. - Mod.CP]
