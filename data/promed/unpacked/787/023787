The following background information on Dengue in Honduras was extracted
from the GIDEON software program:
1977 - Dengue was first reported in Honduras
1978 - 112,492 cases were reported (including the country's first 5 cases
of dengue hemorrhagic fever or DHF - all fatal)
1979 - 1,000 cases were reported
1980 - 2,078
1981 - 1,612
1982 - 1,217
1983 - 719
1984 - 378
1985 - 307
1986 - 569
1987 - 261 cases were officially reported (however, approximately 9,500
cases were registered during an outbreak in Choluteca that year)
1988 - 844 cases were reported
1989 - 2,507
1990 - 1,700
1991 - 5,303 (including 16 DHF, 1 fatal)
1992 - 2,113 cases (including 1 DHF) were reported
1993 - no data
1994 - no data
1995 - 27,560 (35 DHF, 5 fatal)
1996 - 5,047 (0 fatal)
[This resume is useful in showing the cyclical nature of the epidemics, and
the unreliability of official figures -- see the data for 1987. It would
be more useful if it also gave the type(s) of dengue involved each year; in
1977 it was type 1, in 1978 probably type 2. -Mod. JW
