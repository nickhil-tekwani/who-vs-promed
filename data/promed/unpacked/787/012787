Chile Struggles to Cope with Outbreak of Respiratory Virus
----------------------------------------------------------
SANTIAGO: Hospitals in the Chilean capital, Santiago, are struggling to
cope with the country's worst outbreak of a respiratory virus infection.
The virus mainly affects babies aged under 6 months and is raging through
the city's suburban slums, which have been affected by recent heavy rains
and freezing temperatures.
Authorities have called on military and police hospitals to provide
overflow beds and oxygen supplies for patients with respiratory syncytial
virus infection.

[Midwinter outbreaks of respiratory syncytial virus infection are
ubiquitous in children in their first years of life in temperate regions of
both the northern and southern hemispheres, and are not normally reported
by ProMED-mail. However, this outbreak may be more severe than normal and
further information on the extent and progress of this outbreak is
requested. - Mod.CP]
