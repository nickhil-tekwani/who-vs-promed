With new possible cases of hantavirus [infections], in a hospital and in a private clinic in Parana, provincial health authorities are requesting that preventive measures be strongly followed, especially by those people who go to the shore of the rivers that are rising currently due to heavy rains.

Dozens of messages are coming into UNO [web based news] warning of the "impressive" number of rodents that are seen the port area and the city of Diamante. "We went fishing and spent the night with the mice, which came out to see us," said Sebastian.

Silvina Saavedra, of provincial Epidemiology who was consulted by UNO said, "the danger is in the barns and houses that are close to the rivers and have been unoccupied." The main preventive measure is "to ventilate closed places and wait for about a half hour before entering," said the provincial official. Saavedra described the areas of highest risk in the province as, "the Diamante Pre-Delta and the islands." Now, with the rivers increasing, the rodents seek to escape the water and take refuge in dark, damp places.

The awareness campaigns continue in hospitals and health centers, especially [emphasizing] the need to keep the vegetation short 30 m (97 ft] around houses.

Yesterday morning [6 Sep 2012], nobody in the San Martin Hospital in Parana could officially confirm if 2 hantavirus patients were there, having contracted the virus that is transmitted [by exposure to] the virus in rodent saliva, feces and urine. A similar response was obtained at the private clinic in Parana, near Diamante city.

Another affected area is Gualeguaychu, where the neighbors are fearful about the proliferation of rodents that have come into more populated areas with the increase of the Gualeguaychu river.

[People are advised to] heed [these preventive measures]:

- Close holes in doors, walls and pipes, keep [bjildings] clean with water and bleach, keep vegetable gardens and fire wood 30 m [97 ft] from houses.

- Ventilate places that have been closed up (houses, barns) at least 30 min before entering. Cover the mouth and nose with a damp handkerchief.

- Carry out the cleaning (floors, tables, drawers and cupboards) with one part bleach in 10 parts of water (leave for 30 min and then rinse). Dampen the floor before sweeping to avoid raising dust.

- When camping, do not sleep directly on the ground. If one encounters a live rodent, use poison or traps. Do not touch or hit them.

[Last year, there were 4 confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Entre Rios province, 2 of whom died (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110523.1562). Cases of hantavirus infections have been reported from various parts of Argentina this year (2012). The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the current one, above, are not specified. As noted in ProMED-mail archive number 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_) virus. Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved, although Andes virus seems unlikely. - Mod. TY
