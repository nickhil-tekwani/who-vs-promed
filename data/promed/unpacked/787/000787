An emergency situation is occurring in the village of Vetas, municipality of Tibú [Norte de Santander department] because of an outbreak of leishmaniasis, which has affected 56 people, including 10 Venezuelans and some pregnant women.

Maribel Trujillo, manager of the Tibú Hospital, said that so far no resources or a source of funding have been allocated for the treatment of Venezuelans who cross the border and reach this locality in the Catatumbo area. "The medical consultations that we are carrying out continue without any coverage and the situation is becoming more critical every day with the outbreak of leishmaniasis, which incudes 10 cases in Venezuelans and some pregnant women. In total for the outbreak, we already have 56 people affected, but we think there may be more Venezuelans in that group, since they are crossing the border looking for work."

The department's health authorities are conducting a review of the emergency in order to carry out a census in the rural area of the municipality.

[Around 99 per cent of all leishmaniasis cases in Colombia are CL (cutaneous leishmaniasis); 0.4 per cent are MCL (mucocutaneous leishmaniasis), and 0.3 per cent are VL (visceral leishmaniasis). Leishmaniasis is especially common in sylvatic foci and in the inter-Andean valleys, where working on coffee plantations is a risk factor. Epidemic outbreaks of CL caused by _L. braziliensis_, _L. guyanensis_, and _L. panamensis_, have been reported since 1984. Urbanization of the disease has been observed in recent years (Alvat J et al: Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012; 7(5): e35671. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0035671; http://journals.plos.org/plosone/doi?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035671). - Mod.EP
