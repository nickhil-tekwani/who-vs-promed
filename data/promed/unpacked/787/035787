Norway's Food Control Authority (SNT) warned Wednesday that bootleg [black
market] rum emanating from Estonia had already caused one fatality in
Finland. The SNT fears tourists may have purchased bottles via illegal
channels.
"We want to warn people against drinking 'Captain Morgan Black Label
Jamaican Rum' if they are unsure it has been purchased via legal channels,"
said SNT information consultant Oeyvind Henriksen in a press release.
According to the SNT Finnish and Estonian police are investigating the
case, and Norwegians should refuse to drink the product unless it comes
from one of the state alcohol monopoly outlets in the Nordic countries.
Finnish authorities say that the fake Captain Morgan bottles containing
ethyl glycol have been very professionally prepared. The bootleg bottles
include original labels and a sealed cork.
Ethyl glycol poisoning can produce dizziness, nausea, increased heart rate,
and kidney failure.

[This may actually be an ethyl glycol ether, also known as 2-ethoxyethanol,
sometimes used as a solvent. It is a colorless liquid with a very mild
odor, which may be concealed by the smell of the rum.
According the manufacturer, swallowing large amounts (no indication of how
much that actually is) may result in gastrointestinal irritation, central
nervous system depression, blood effects, and liver and kidney damage.
Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and loss of
consciousness. Chronic effects of overexposure may include kidney and/or
liver damage. Repeated or prolonged contact can cause defatting of skin and
lead to irritation and dermatitis. Â­ Mod.TG]
