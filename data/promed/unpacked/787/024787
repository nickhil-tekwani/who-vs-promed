One person has been hospitalized after an "unconfirmed report of ricin" at a Dinkytown apartment building, according to the Minneapolis Fire Department.

Minneapolis Fire says crews were called to 515 14th Avenue SE Tuesday afternoon [7 May 2019] on a report of a hazardous substance.

Crews are evacuating the apartment building and isolating the affected area according to Minneapolis Fire's Twitter account.

The fire department says one resident was transported to the hospital.

According to the CDC, ricin is a poison naturally found in castor beans, and if chewed and swallowed, it can be dangerous. But it can also be in the form of a powder, mist or pellet.

Within a few hours of inhaling ricin, a person would likely have trouble breathing, fever, cough and nausea. It can ultimately lead to death.

The CDC also says there is no antidote for ricin, which is why it's so important to avoid exposure to it.

The apartment building, called The Marshall, describes itself as "off-campus housing." It's located right on the edge of the University of Minnesota campus.

[The article is a bit sparse in details. Any time a type of substance such as this is used, it is concerning. One has to wonder whether this was a science experiment gone sideways? Was this someone planning something nefarious? Was the individual the victim of a crime, or perhaps carelessness in their own project? Or perhaps the perpetrator of a crime only on themselves? We may never know answers to those questions.

"Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. If castor beans are chewed and swallowed, the released ricin can cause injury. Ricin can be made from the waste material left over from processing castor beans. It is a potent protein derived from the beans of the castor plant (_Ricinus communis_). Castor beans are used in the production of castor oil, a brake and hydraulic fluid constituent. The aqueous phase of the process, termed the "waste mash," is 5% to 10% ricin.

Castor oil does not contain ricin. Ricin has been used experimentally in medicine to kill cancer cells. Ricin works by getting inside the cells of a person's body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need; hence, it is often called a toxalbumin. Without the proteins, cells die. Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may occur.

Ricin can be in the form of a powder, a mist, or a pellet, or it can be dissolved in water or weak acid. It is a stable substance under normal conditions but can be inactivated by heat above 80 C (176 F).

Effects of ricin poisoning depend on whether ricin was inhaled, ingested, or injected. The major symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on the route of exposure and the dose received, although many organs may be affected in severe cases. Initial symptoms of ricin poisoning by inhalation may occur within 8 hours of exposure. Following ingestion of ricin, initial symptoms typically occur in less than 6 hours.

Inhalation: Within a few hours of inhaling significant amounts of ricin, the likely symptoms would be respiratory distress (difficulty breathing), fever, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy sweating may follow as well as fluid building up in the lungs (pulmonary edema). This would make breathing even more difficult, and the skin might turn blue. Excess fluid in the lungs would be diagnosed by x-ray or by listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Finally, low blood pressure and respiratory failure may occur, leading to death. In cases of known exposure to ricin, people having respiratory symptoms that start within 12 hours of inhaling ricin should seek medical care.

Ingestion: If someone swallows a significant amount of ricin, he or she would develop vomiting and diarrhea that may become bloody. Severe dehydration may be the result, followed by low blood pressure. Other signs or symptoms may include hallucinations, seizures, and blood in the urine. Within several days, the person's liver, spleen, and kidneys might stop working, and the person could die.

Skin and eye exposure: Ricin is unlikely to be absorbed through normal skin. Contact with ricin powders or products may cause redness and pain of the skin and the eyes.

Death from ricin poisoning [may] take place within 36 to 72 hours of exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or injection) and the dose received. If in suspected situations where ricin may have been disseminated, preliminary environmental testing by public health or law enforcement authorities may detect ricin in powders or materials released into the immediate environment. Persons occupying such areas may initially be observed for signs of ricin poisoning.

No widely available, reliable medical test exists to confirm a person has been exposed to ricin.

Because no antidote exists for ricin, the most important factor is to avoid ricin exposure in the 1st place. If exposure cannot be avoided, the most important factor is then getting the ricin off or out of the body as quickly as possible.

Symptomatic ricin poisoning is treated by giving victims supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the poisoning. The types of supportive medical care would depend on several factors, such as the route by which victims were poisoned (that is, whether poisoning was by inhalation, ingestion, or skin or eye exposure). Care could include such measures as helping victims breathe, giving them intravenous fluids (fluids given through a needle inserted into a vein), giving them medications to treat conditions such as seizures and low blood pressure, flushing their stomachs with activated charcoal (if the ricin has been very recently ingested), or washing out their eyes with water if their eyes are irritated.
