First bluetongue case in Austria
--------------------------------
The 1st case of BT [bluetongue disease] has been detected in a heifer in
[the state of] Upper Austria (Oberoesterreich). The case was detected in a
cow during routine surveillance in the northern Austrian district of
Schaerding, carried out by the Agency for Health and Food Safety.

The virus does not affect humans, as stated in a calming press release by
the minister of health, Andrea Kdolsky on Wednesday [5 Nov 2008].
Significant implications for the dairy and meat industries and livestock
are to be expected, however, because the disease reduces performance and
may affect the fertility.

Immediately after the detection of the BT infection, a blood sample was
sent to the European reference laboratory in Pirbright, Britain for further
investigation.

Compulsory bluetongue vaccinations have been carried out in the provinces
of Tyrol and Vorarlberg, since July [2008]. This, in view of the occurrence
of the disease in neighboring countries during 2006 and 2007, said Kdolsky.

"Vaccination will be carried out until March 2009, also outside the
protection and surveillance zone, to minimise the risk of spread," the
minister said. Animals susceptible to the virus within 150 km (93 miles) of
the confirmed case would be monitored and inoculated.

The vaccination is given to the farmers free of charge. The federal
government and the European Union bear the costs of the vaccine as well as
of its application by the veterinarians.

[The item above also includes fragments derived from an International
Herald Tribune/Associated Press newswire dated 5 Nov 2008 (see at
<http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/11/05/europe/EU-Austria-Livestock-Disease.php>).
A confirmation from the EU reference laboratory, addressing the serotype
(which is, most likely, BTV-8) is anticipated.

An official notification of this outbreak to the OIE (World Organisation
for Animal Health), with the available additional information on the
epidemiological and laboratory investigations, is expected soon.

The Upper Austrian areas, which have now been demarcated by Austria as
"surveillance and/or protection zones... in accordance with Article 8 of
Council Directive 2000/75/EC" are included in Zone F (namely the zone where
BTV-8 may be circulating or where vaccination against it is applied) and
can be seen on the table, updated as of 5 Nov 2008, at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bt_restrictedzones.pdf>.

The active disease season is expected to terminate towards the end of
November (2008), with the decrease of temperatures and of the vector
activity. - Mod.AS
