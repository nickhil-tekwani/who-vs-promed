Thirty people in Sweden fell ill with scombroid poisoning after eating tuna from Viet Nam earlier this month [May 2020]. The histamine poisoning foodborne outbreak was linked to frozen tuna loins from Viet Nam, via the Netherlands.

Local authorities were responsible for the outbreak investigation and tracing of food batches. The Swedish Food Agency (Livsmedelsverket) is the national contact point for Europe's Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF).

Mats Lindblad, from the Swedish Food Agency, said about 30 people were sick, but no deaths were reported.

"Symptoms were typical for histamine poisoning and included swelling, hives, irregular heartbeat, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting," he told Food Safety News. "All reported cases had consumed a dish with tuna at the same restaurant. The outbreak occurred at the beginning of May [2020]. The link to the tuna loins is based on the epidemiological outbreak investigation. Samples have been taken from the incriminated batch, but results are pending."

"Thirty people is more than usual for a histamine outbreak in Sweden," Lindblad continued. "Normally reports of histamine food poisoning concern single cases or a few persons only. Normally the agency receives reports of around 10 outbreaks or single cases each year," he added.

Distribution of the frozen tuna loins also included Austria, Cyprus, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, according to the RASFF portal.

Onset of histamine food poisoning symptoms can range from minutes to several hours following ingestion of toxin. Typically, the average incubation period before illness is one hour.

The most common symptoms of histamine or scombroid fish poisoning are tingling or burning sensation in the mouth, facial swelling, rash, hives and itchy skin, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. They usually resolve within several hours without medical intervention. If symptoms are severe, an individual should seek medical attention for treatment and can be treated with antihistamines.

Production of histamine is related to mishandling of food due to storage at incorrect temperatures. Once histamine has been produced, it cannot be eliminated by normal cooking or freezing temperatures.

[Likely this particular situation was larger than usual because of the vast dispersion of the frozen tuna.

Abstracts of 2 good reviews on the subject follow:

1. Taylor SL, Stratton JE and Nordlee JA: Histamine poisoning (scombroid fish poisoning): an allergy-like intoxication. J Toxicol Clin Toxicol. 1989; 27(4-5): 225-40. doi: 10.3109/15563658908994420.

"Abstract
--------
Histamine poisoning results from the consumption of foods, typically certain types of fish and cheeses that contain unusually high levels of histamine. Spoiled fish of the families Scombridae and Scomberesocidae (e.g., tuna, mackerel, bonito) are commonly implicated in incidents of histamine poisoning, which leads to the common usage of the term "scombroid fish poisoning" to describe this illness. However, certain non-scombroid fish, most notably mahi-mahi, bluefish, and sardines, when spoiled, are also commonly implicated in histamine poisoning. Also, on rare occasions, cheeses, especially Swiss cheese, can be implicated in histamine poisoning. The symptoms of histamine poisoning generally resemble the symptoms encountered with IgE-mediated food allergies. The symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, an oral burning sensation or peppery taste, hives, itching, red rash, and hypotension. The onset of the symptoms usually occurs within a few minutes after ingestion of the implicated food, and the duration of symptoms ranges from a few hours to 24 hours. Antihistamines can be used effectively to treat this intoxication. Histamine is formed in foods by certain bacteria that are able to decarboxylate the amino acid histidine. However, foods containing unusually high levels of histamine may not appear to be outwardly spoiled. Foods with histamine concentrations exceeding 50 mg per 100 g of food are generally considered to be hazardous. Histamine formation in fish can be prevented by proper handling and refrigerated storage while the control of histamine formation in cheese seems dependent on ensuring that histamine-producing bacteria are not present in significant numbers in the raw milk."

"Abstract
--------
Scombroid poisoning, also called histamine fish poisoning, is an allergy-like form of food poisoning that continues to be a major problem in seafood safety. The exact role of histamine in scombroid poisoning is not straightforward. Deviations from the expected dose-response have led to the advancement of various possible mechanisms of toxicity, none of them proven. Histamine action levels are used in regulation until more is known about the mechanism of scombroid poisoning. Scombroid poisoning and histamine are correlated but complicated. Victims of scombroid poisoning respond well to antihistamines, and chemical analyses of fish implicated in scombroid poisoning generally reveal elevated levels of histamine. Scombroid poisoning is unique among the seafood toxins since it results from product mishandling rather than contamination from other trophic levels. Inadequate cooling following harvest promotes bacterial histamine production and can result in outbreaks of scombroid poisoning. Fish with high levels of free histidine, the enzyme substrate converted to histamine by bacterial histidine decarboxylase, are those most often implicated in scombroid poisoning. Laboratory methods and screening methods for detecting histamine are available in abundance but need to be compared and validated to harmonize testing. Successful field testing, including dockside or on-board testing, needed to augment HACCP efforts will have to integrate rapid and simplified detection methods with simplified and rapid sampling and extraction. Otherwise, time-consuming sample preparation reduces the impact of gains in detection speed on the overall analysis time."
