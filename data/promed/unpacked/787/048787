This could be _Bacillus cereus_ food poisoning, which occurs when
rice is cooked in bulk and then stored in a large container at [warm]
room temperatures. As it is a toxin, the incubation period is short.
The toxin is not destroyed by a quick fry. Staphylococcal food
poisoning is less likely.

[_Bacillus cereus_ produces one emetic [vomit-inducing] toxin (ETE)
and 3 different enterotoxins: HBL, Nhe,and EntK.

2 of the enterotoxins are involved in food poisoning. They both
consist of 3 different protein subunits that act together. One of
these enterotoxins (HBL) is also a hemolysin [destroys red blood
cells]. All 3 enterotoxins are cytotoxic [poisonous to cells] and cell
membrane active toxins that will make holes or channels in cell walls.
The non-hemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) is one of the enterotoxins
responsible for diarrhea in _Bacillus cereus_ food poisoning.

_Bacillus cereus_ has been recognized as an agent of food poisoning
since 1955. There are only a few outbreaks a year reported by CDC.
Between 1972 and 1986, 52 outbreaks of food-borne disease associated
with _B. cereus_ were reported to the CDC (in 2003, there were 2),
but this is thought to represent only 2 percent of the total cases
which have occurred during these periods. It is not a reportable
disease and usually goes undiagnosed.

_B. cereus_ causes 2 types of food-borne illnesses. One type is
characterized by nausea and vomiting and abdominal cramps and has an
incubation period of one to 6 hours. It resembles _Staphylococcus
aureus_ (staph) food poisoning in its symptoms and incubation period.
This is the "short-incubation" or emetic [vomiting] form of the disease.
