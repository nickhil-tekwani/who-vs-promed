[Mono County, California has] had 3 laboratory confirmed cases of [tickborne relapsing fever] TBRF reported. There are also several other persons with similar illnesses who were not confirmed, but were also probably infected. Not all were Mono County residents, but most of the exposures were likely in Mono County. One was briefly hospitalized, and all are reported to be doing well. This is about soft ticks -- which you will never see, and are not the hard ticks that can cause Lyme disease.

Relapsing fever is caused by a spirochete in the _Borrelia_ genus. The _Ornithodoros_ tick vector can be seen at http://www.lyme.org/img/gallery/o_hermsi.jpg.

The diagnosis of relapsing fever can be readily made during febrile periods by a Wright's stain of the peripheral blood. Unlike other spirochetes, this organism readily picks up the Wright stain. The typical peripheral blood smear can be seen at http://www.cdc.gov/relapsing-fever/images/tbrf-smear.jpg

The relapses appear to be caused by changes in the outer protein antigens of the organism. For additional reading on the manifestations of the tick-borne form, references 1 and 2 are useful.
