The Shiawassee Humane Society [SHS] reported today [3 May 2010] that one
confirmed case of a fatal, incurable disease called feline infectious
peritonitis [FIP] has occurred within its cat population at the shelter.

Based on recent medical research and consultation with MSU [Michigan State
University] doctors and area veterinarian, the board of directors and staff
decided upon precautionary steps to protect the majority of the cats
currently at the shelter from the disease.

"We are devastated that up to 35 cats and kittens, those that currently
show no signs but are most vulnerable to the disease, may be euthanized to
protect the remaining majority," board president Robert Meihls said
following the board's 28 Apr 2010 meeting.

Sandi Wright, SHS executive director added: "We are very concerned about
the presence of FIP in our cat population and are doing everything possible
to provide the highest standards of care. We have been working with experts
at the MSU School of Veterinary Medicine to determine our necessary course
of action." She continued, "Our Board, staff and volunteers are all
committed to protecting our cats and are taking the best course of action
offered by our area experts."

Wright gathered information and options to determine the course of action
in part from MSU's School of Veterinary Medicine, as well as input from
local sources. It was previously thought the only solution for shelters
with FIP was to euthanize the entire population possibly exposed to the FIP
virus. However, new findings about the disease offer alternatives for
saving the population that allow shelters to effectively continue adopting
out the cats.

The SHS Board determined the course of action based on information gathered
from several sources including local veterinarian Dr Nick Skarich of
Northside Animal Hospital. Skarich said in a letter last week [week of 26
Apr 2010] to the board, "FIP is very difficult to diagnose, control or
prevent. There is no treatment and the disease is 100 per cent fatal once
an animal shows clinical signs. Although this is a sad and difficult time,
I am confident that the Humane Society is responding with appropriate
measures."

According to Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, the disease
is thought to be a mutation of the coronavirus and is relatively uncommon
in the general cat population. However, the disease rate is much higher in
multiple-cat populations, such as some shelters and catteries.

A recent study found that, although the coronavirus is common, the mutated
FIP virus develops in only an average of 5 per cent of those cats infected
with coronavirus. As long as a cat retains a healthy immune system, the
coronavirus is unlikely to mutate. "Our focus will be on cats whose immune
system is weakened by stress or other unrelated illness or who came to us
under 6 months of age," Wright said.

One of the most difficult aspects of FIP is there is no simple diagnostic
test and once symptoms become present, there is no treatment. However, new
research states that if less than 1 per cent of the population develops FIP
it is most likely safe to retain the population and safe to adopt them out.
"Regardless of the rarity of this disease, we will be sending information
about this virus and its symptoms to all who have adopted cats from us in
the last 30 days," Wright said.

"We are saddened and disheartened anytime we experience a loss at the
shelter," Meihls reiterated. "Our mission is to provide shelter and
adoption to homeless companion pets, so to lose even one pet is very
difficult. We have been diligent in improving our ability to meet our
mission through many significant improvements including facility upgrades,
standards of care, air quality, occupancy reduction, and administrative
controls and we are committed to addressing this situation with all our new
capabilities."

The feline coronavirus is the virus responsible for feline infectious
peritonitis (FIP).

Feline coronavirus operates differently from any other feline virus in
several important ways: a) systemic antibodies have no protective function
for the cat and may play a role in the disease FIP itself; b) antibody
titres are meaningless for diagnosis of FIP or prognosis; c) a vaccine is
available, but there is no consensus on its efficacy or safety.

The disease and the virus can be confusing without some terminology:
- FIP is the term for clinical disease associated with feline coronavirus
infection;
- the common benign form of feline coronavirus is referred to as FECV
(feline enteric coronavirus);
- when FECV has mutated into a disease-causing form, it is then referred to
as FIPV (feline infectious peritonitis virus);
- feline coronaviruses in general are referred to as FCoV.

FECV is a very common, highly infectious feline virus. It belongs to the
genus _Coronavirus_, which has members that infect other species (man,
swine, cattle, birds, dogs). The majority of cats with FECV (about 95 per
cent or more) remain healthy. But in a small number of cases, FECV
infection is the 1st step in a chain of events leading to FIP. This happens
because coronaviruses are made of large numbers of nucleotides, the basic
unit of genetic material, and they are very prone to mutations. As a virus
reproduces itself, errors are made in copying these nucleotides. The more
nucleotides, the more errors are possible. While most of these errors are
harmless, some will have the effect of giving FECV the ability to cause
disease. These mutant FECV strains are called FIPV.

Recent research has shown that mutant FECVs arise within an individual cat.
Thus, we now know that the vast majority of cats do not "catch" FIP, but
they develop it themselves from their own mutant FECV. Transmission of FIP
from cat to cat is considered rare. This fact has caused leading FIP
researchers to state that cats who are ill with FIP are unlikely to be a
risk to other cats and thus do not need to be isolated.

It has been estimated that in multi-cat households where FECV has been
introduced, 80-90 per cent of all the cats will be infected. Catteries are
especially likely to be FECV positive since traffic of cats and kittens in
and out of the establishment is common. However, the incidence of cases of
FIP is quite low in comparison. Generally, most catteries experience far
less than 10 per cent losses to FIP over the years. Rare instances have
been documented where an apparent epidemic of FIP is associated with
mortality rates of over 10 per cent in a short period of time. One possible
factor in these epidemics is the shedding of virulent virus, an uncommon
situation. Usually, losses are sporadic and unpredictable. The peak ages
for losses to FIP are from 6 months to 2 years old (with the highest
incidence at 10 months of age). Age-associated immunity to FIP appears to
be possible. Transmission of FIP from a queen to her unborn kittens has not
been shown to occur.

Research has shown that there are 2 main patterns that occur with FECV
infection. Most cats will become infected and recover, but will not be
immune. They are susceptible to reinfection the next time they contact the
virus. A small number of cats become infected but do not recover. They
become persistent shedders of FECV in the cattery and are the source of
reinfection for the other cats. Therefore, the key to eliminating FECV (and
thus the risk of FIP) in a cattery would be the identification and removal
of chronic shedders. Currently, however, there is no easy way to determine
which cats in a cattery are persistent shedders. The traditional antibody
titre for FECV cannot be used to determine which cats are chronic shedders.
The most effective and practical tool is PCR analysis of feces for the
presence of FECV, a test which is not yet widely available.

FECV is spread primarily by the fecal-oral route and, to a lesser degree,
through saliva or respiratory droplets. The virus can persist in the
environment in dried feces on cat litter for 3 to 7 weeks, so scrupulous
cleaning of cages and litter pans is important to reduce the amount of
virus in the environment. It is important to have adequate numbers of
litter pans available and that they be scooped at least daily and dumped
and disinfected at least weekly. Litter pans should be kept away from food
bowls and spilled litter should be regularly vacuumed up from the floor.

As with so many aspects of FIP, testing remains problematic. To date, there
is no way to screen healthy cats for the risk of developing FIP. Antibody
titres are poorly correlated with risk of FIP and should not be used to
screen cats. As well as problems with interpretation of these antibody
tests, there are problems with laboratory quality control. There are newer
DNA-based tests offered by a few labs that are purported to be
FIP-specific. However, these tests are considered unvalidated by experts as
they have not been subjected to scientific scrutiny by researchers outside
of the labs that offer them. In addition, there are no published studies
that have identified the genetic difference between FECV and FIPV. An
article was published by the Cornell Feline Health Center in 1998 warning
that the so-called FIP-specific ELISA tests are based on insufficient data
and the assays are not yet validated.

The fact remains that we have no screening test for FIP in well cats.
Neither do we have a foolproof way to diagnose FIP in a sick cat. The gold
standard remains a biopsy or findings at necropsy.

Probably one of the most controversial areas in any discussion of FIP is
Primucell FIP, the vaccine made by Pfizer Animal Health, available since
1991. The vaccine is a modified-live temperature-sensitive viral mutant
licensed for intranasal use in cats at least 16 weeks of age. The
manufacturer recommends annual revaccination although no duration of
immunity studies are available. The vaccine stimulates local immunity and
will also produce an antibody titre. Evaluation of the risks and benefits
associated with this vaccine is a difficult venture and has engendered much
controversy.

Since FIP is a severe and fatal disease, the safety of any vaccine is a
paramount consideration. Dr Fred Scott of the Cornell Feline Health Center,
concluded in a recently published paper, that the risks associated with the
Primucell FIP vaccine are minimal in most situations. He notes that the
vaccine has been in use for 7 years with no increase in the incidence of FIP.

On the other side of the issue, the benefits of the Primucell FIP vaccine
appear to be small. The best reported efficacy for the vaccine is seen when
FCoV negative cats at least 16 weeks old were vaccinated twice (3 weeks
apart), in a study by Dr Nancy Reeves published in 1995. In this study,
FCoV antibody-negative cats were vaccinated before entering a large cat
shelter where FIP was endemic. The vaccinated cats experienced a
significantly lower mortality rate than unvaccinated cats. The efficacy of
the vaccination was calculated to be 75 per cent (preventable fraction).
