St. Louis Encephalitis, alert - USA (Florida) 970802110251

Florida Department of Health officials today confirmed the first two human
cases of St. Louis Encephalitis in 1997. One case is an 82-year-old
Brevard County man and the other a 71-year-old woman from Lee County.
Neither case was fatal; both residents were hospitalized and are now
recovering. County health officials are currently investigating the cases.
Based on the presence of the St. Louis Encephalitis virus in sentinel
chickens, medical alerts have previously been issued in the Brevard, Orange
and Indian River counties. On Thursday, health officials also issued a
medical alert for St. Louis Encephalitis in Lee County.
Due to the Statewide Epidemiology Seminar in Orlando (Friday, 26 September)
there will be no SLE conference call. The calls will resume beginning 3
October at the same number used previously. Staff at the Bureau continue
to monitor the situation and any important developments occurring in the
meantime will both be announced at the meeting and sent out via CC:mail and
fax to necessary personnel.
The Bureau of Epidemiology is now maintaining a new toll-free Epi Help Line
for current information concerning disease issues of interest to Florida
residents and visitors. The number is 1-888-880-5782
