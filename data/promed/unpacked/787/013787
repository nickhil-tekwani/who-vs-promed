New Mexico State officials have confirmed a fourth case of cat plague in
Santa Fe County this year, raising concern humans could contract the plague
(_Yersenia pestis_) from their pets. Santa Fe County has accounted for 2 of
the cases confirmed this year in New Mexico. The state Environment
Department said yesterday, in addition to the latest case, a cat in Lincoln
County has also been diagnosed with the disease. Both animals have been
treated with antibiotics and are recovering. The department recommends
dusting pets for fleas, eliminating places rodents can hide, and avoiding
sick or dead rodents and their burrows.

[Plague is an acute, highly fatal disease caused by infection with
_Yersinia pestis_, a gram-negative bacterium. The 3 major clinical forms of
the disease are bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. Fleas are often
associated with carrying plague. There are many excellent flea control
methods, sprays, dips, spot-ons for pets. Comprehensive flea control is
important, spraying the yard, having the carpets, furniture etc. treated is
also important. Veterinarians are able to assist pet owners with some of
the newer products available for pets. - Mod.TG
