A Boulder, Colorado resident has tested positive for plague, the 1st human case in Boulder in more than 20 years. The Boulder resident had found a dead chipmunk on his/her property and a few days later went to the doctor after experiencing fever, chills, muscle pain, weakness, loss of appetite and confusion. The person received antimicrobial treatment and went home to recover.

This is the 1st person to test positive for the plague in Boulder County since 1993. 3 other Colorado residents have become ill from the disease as far in 2015, 2 of them did not survive.

"In Boulder County, we so often see plague in prairie dogs," said Jamie Feld, Communicable Disease Control program epidemiologist, in a statement. "This is a good reminder that plague-infected fleas are also found on many other wild rodents."

In 2014, 8 people tested positive for plague in Colorado.

[So far in 2015, there have been 6 cases of _Y. pestis_ infection in the western USA with 3 fatalities. Although not specifically reported, the benign nature of this case suggests that it was bubonic in nature. - Mod.LL
