The Georgia Department of Agriculture is quarantining PetSmart stores
in the state and a Superpetz store in Martinez due to psittacosis
[also called parrot fever and ornithosis], a bird disease that can be
transferred to humans, Commissioner of Agriculture Tommy Irvin
announced today [28 Dec 2007].

Psittacosis is a bacterial disease that primarily affects parrots,
parakeets and other members of the parrot family. It is treatable but
can be fatal to the birds. Only in rare cases does it infect poultry.
The disease produces flu-like symptoms in humans, but it does not
respond to treatments for the flu. The disease is especially
dangerous to the young, the elderly and people with weakened immune
systems such as persons with chronic disease, AIDS or HIV infection
or those taking chemotherapy for cancer.

"We have had 2 confirmed cases of psittacosis at PetSmart stores in
Hiram and Woodstock. There have also been confirmed cases at the
dealer, Preferred Birds of Milton, Florida, that supplied birds to
all the stores we are quarantining," said Commissioner Irvin.
PetSmart had already begun a quarantine, but the quarantine did not
meet all state requirements. "We are requiring PetSmart and Superpetz
to move the birds away from the public and to begin using medicated
feed to treat the birds. The quarantine will last 45 days or until
released by our State Veterinarian," said Commissioner Irvin.

The quarantine applies only to birds sold at the stores, not to other
animals. If you purchased a bird from PetSmart or the Martinez
Superpetz and have concerns about its health, please contact your
veterinarian, or if you have concerns about your health, contact your
health care provider or local health department.

A local pet store may have sold birds that were infected with a
disease that can be passed to humans. Some birds shipped by a
national distributor tested positive for avian chlamydiosis, a bird
disease that can cause psittacosis [also called parrot fever and
ornithosis] when contracted by humans, according to a Washington
State Department of Health press release.

20 PetSmart stores in the state, including the store on Meridian
Street in Bellingham, received birds from the vendor. The birds may
have been sold since October 2007.

The disease is generally mild in humans but can become more serious
if it is not recognized and treated, according to the press release.
There have been no reports of humans contracting the disease thus
far. It is not the same as avian influenza or the "bird flu," which
has made headlines in recent years.

Humans can contract the disease when they inhale dust from dried bird
droppings or respiratory secretions. It can cause a fever, chills,
headaches and a cough between 5 and 19 days after exposure, according
to the press release. It is unclear what kind of birds were infected
or sold by PetSmart, but the disease is most often found in
cockatiels, cockatoos, parrots and parakeets, according to the press
release. PetSmart has removed all the birds supplied by the vendor
and is treating its sick and exposed birds with antibiotics,
according to the press release. Customers who bought birds from the
store will be receiving letters informing them of the potential for
the disease. Managers at the Bellingham PetSmart did not return phone
calls seeking comment. Regularly cleaning bird cages can help prevent
the spread of the disease. Anyone who develops the symptoms of
psittacosis and has been near pet birds is encouraged to contact
their doctor.

Washington State Department of Health issued a warning on 28 Dec 2007
that some recently sold cockatiels or other pet birds may carry a
disease known as avian chlamydiosis and that exposure to the infected
birds may cause a human form of the disease called psittacosis, or
parrot fever, or ornithosis.

Some birds shipped by a national distributor tested positive for
avian chlamydiosis, and about 20 PetSmart stores in 11 Washington
counties, including Benton, Clark, King, Kitsap, Pierce, Skagit,
Snohomish, Spokane, Thurston, Whatcom and Yakima, have received birds
from this vendor, according to state health officials.

No human cases of psittacosis acquired from the affected pet birds
have been reported in the state, according to the state department of
health. The pet store chain has voluntarily removed all birds
supplied by the wholesale distributor. Sick and exposed birds are
being treated with antibiotics. Store workers have been notified of
the risk and instructed in proper cleanup and handling of the birds.
Consumers who bought birds from the affected stores will receive
letters about avian chlamydiosis and psittacosis.

Avian chlamydiosis is caused by a type of bacterium called
_Chlamydophila psittaci_, which is frequently found in birds, but
does not cause the disease as frequently. Sick birds experience loss
of appetite, coughing, nasal discharge, sneezing, lethargy and
diarrhea. The birds most vulnerable to the disease are psittacine
species, including cockatiels, cockatoos, parrots and parakeets.

Humans can develop psittacosis after inhaling dust from dried bird
droppings, respiratory secretions and dust from feathers of infected
birds. The symptoms of the disease in humans include fever, headache,
chills, coughing and muscle aches. The symptoms, often mild, develop
within 5 to 19 days of infection. Antibiotics are often used to treat
the disease.

Psittacosis is rare in humans. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention reported on 14 Jul 2000 that the agency recorded 813
cases of psittacosis during the period between 1988 and 1998. Most of
the cases resulted from exposure to infected pet birds, usually
cockatiels, parakeets, parrots, and macaws, which may not have to
show any symptoms to cause the infection.

In Connecticut, the State Departments of Agriculture and Public
Health also issued a statement on 28 Dec 2007 to say the state was
notified that cockatiels in several pet stores in the state might
have been exposed to avian chlamydiosis. The health officials said no
sick birds are known to have been sold and no human cases of
psittacosis associated with sick birds have been reported.

Health officials in both Washington and Connecticut advised owners of
pet birds to exercise good hygiene practice. To prevent the spreading
of the disease from birds to humans, a non-dusty litter should be
used under the wire mesh and changed daily. Water and food feeders
should be emptied and thoroughly cleaned up daily.

[_Chlamydophila psittaci_ has been isolated from approximately 100
bird species, but most human _C. psittaci_ infections result from
exposure to pet psittacine birds. However, transmission has been
documented from other birds, including doves, pigeons, birds of prey,
and shore birds.

The following is from a more detailed discussion of _C. psittaci_
infection in the prior ProMED-mail post 20071203.3891: Psittacosis,
also called parrot fever or ornithosis, is a zoonosis caused by
_Chlamydophila psittaci_ (formerly _Chlamydia psittaci_), an obligate
intracellular bacterial pathogen. The infection has worldwide
distribution and occurs in many types of both domestic and wild
birds, not just psittacine birds as its name, psittacosis, implies.
Even mammals such as goats, cows and sheep may be infected. The
infection in birds may be latent, but when stressed by crowding or
prolonged transport, the birds can develop conjunctivitis,
respiratory distress and diarrhea. The microorganism is shed in
liquid feces and respiratory secretions. When the feces dry, the
organisms can become airborne as droplet nuclei that remain suspended
in air, traveling widely by air currents. The dried organisms can
remain viable for months at room temperature.

Humans become infected by inhalation of these infectious aerosols.
The incubation period generally is 5-14 days following exposure. From
experimental studies in monkeys exposed to infectious aerosols, the
earliest lesion is thought to be a respiratory bronchiolitis,
followed by centrifugal spread that results in a lobular pneumonia
(McGavran MH, et al. The pathogenesis of psittacosis. Serial studies
on rhesus monkeys exposed to a small-particle aerosol of the Borg
strain. Am J Path 1962; 40:653-70). The illness in humans presents as
an atypical pneumonia syndrome that can resemble influenza pneumonia.
The organisms are also thought to spread systemically via the blood
stream and cause, on occasion, a typhoid-like syndrome, hepatitis,
myocarditis, pericarditis, endocarditis, neurologic involvement, or
nephritis. The diagnosis is suspected on the basis of atypical
pneumonia that follows exposure to birds and is usually confirmed
serologically or by means of a culture or PCR of respiratory
secretions.
