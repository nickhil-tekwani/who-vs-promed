A number of factors lead to lower canola yields. A July [2007] heat
wave tops the list, but others include disease and herbicide
carryover. 2007 canola yields were below expectations on many farms.

A senior agri-coach with Agri-Trend Agrology, Phil Thomas, says
"there was an awful lot of blackleg out there. More than there should
be with resistant seed varieties." That raises the possibility of a
new strain of the disease.

[The fungus _Leptosphaeria maculans_ (previously _Phoma lingam_)
causes blackleg, also called _Phoma_ stem canker, on oilseed rape
(_Brassica napus_). Blackleg is the most serious disease of rapeseed
cultivars, including canola, in most of the world's production areas.
The fungus can also affect other hosts in the genus _Brassica_ such
as cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and turnip.
Symptoms on rapeseed are greyish leaf lesions, which may crack
internally and coalesce. The lesions often expand down leaf veins
towards the base of the leaf. In severe epidemics, lesions can be
found on the stems and pods. Typical stem cankers lead to premature
ripening or collapse of the crop. The fungus is seed-borne and is
spread by wind and infected crop litter. It may overwinter in
stubble. Disease management includes use of clean seed, cultural
practices to minimise inoculum, fungicides, and planting of resistant
cultivars.

The pathogen is extremely diverse. Populations consist of a high
number of unique genotypes. There has been good resistance in
commercial cultivars for almost 20 years against the predominant race
PG2. New and virulent isolates belonging to other races have appeared
recently in Canada and the USA causing significant disease. In Europe
and Australia, extensive use of cultivars with single gene resistance
led to breakdown of host resistance resulting from a shift in _L.
maculans_ populations. This has caused significant economic losses to farmers.

Pathogens can mutate spontaneously and randomly, and mutants are
referred to as pathotypes, races, or strains. They may differ in
their ability to infect host cultivars, depending on what resistance
gene or genes are present in the host. If a new strain has developed
the ability to overcome a particular resistance gene, the resistance
in the respective host cultivars is said to have "broken down."
However, it is the pathogen that has changed, not the resistance gene
in the host cultivar.

Canola is a trademarked quality description of a group of cultivars
of rapeseed variants from which low erucic acid rapeseed oil and low
glucosinolate meal are obtained. Canola was initially bred in Canada
in 1978 and the word was derived from "CANadian Oil, Low Acid,"
