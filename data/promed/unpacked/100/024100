An Indonesian factory worker died of bird flu, bringing the death toll
in the country worst hit by the virus to 112, a top health official
said Sunday [3 Aug 2008]. The 19-year-old died last week in a hospital
just west of the capital, Jakarta, Nyoman Kandun, the director general
of communicable disease control at the Health Ministry, said by text
message. He gave no additional information.

Indonesia has regularly recorded human deaths from bird flu since the
virus began ravaging poultry stocks across Asia in 2003. Its toll of
112 accounts for nearly half the 240 recorded fatalities worldwide.

Bird flu remains hard for people to catch, but health experts worry
that the virus could mutate into a form that passes easily between
humans, possibly triggering a pandemic that could kill millions. So
far, most human cases have been linked to contact with infected birds.
Scientists have warned that Indonesia, which has millions of backyard
chickens and poor medical facilities, is a potential hot spot for the
start of a global pandemic.
