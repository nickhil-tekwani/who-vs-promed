Bellevue hospital employees face Ebola at work, and stigma of it everywhere
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
For 6 years, Mayra Martinez had been going to the same beautician in Queens [New York City], and considered her a friend. On Saturday [25 Oct 2014], while getting her hair done, Ms. Martinez, 45, mentioned she had just gotten a new job. "Where?" the beautician asked. "Bellevue," Ms. Martinez said. "She just froze and asked, 'Are you anywhere near him?'" Ms. Martinez recalled. Then the beautician asked her to please find someone else to do her hair. By "him," the beautician meant CS, who is New York's 1st Ebola patient. As Bellevue Hospital Center goes into its 8th day of treating CS, who had worked with Doctors Without Borders [MSF] in Guinea, some of its employees are feeling stigmatized -- a harsh consequence of being at the 1st hospital in the city to deal with an outbreak that has killed about 5000 people in West Africa, and that is known to kill about half the people who become infected....

Bellevue's medical director, Dr. Nate Link, said that more than a dozen employees had reported being discriminated against, including not being welcome at a business or social event. Some nurses who moonlight at other jobs have been told they are not needed there, according to the New York State Nurses Association, a union. One nurse said her child was not allowed to go to day care. "These are obviously related to irrational fears in the community," Dr. Link said. On the subway to work early Tuesday [28 Oct 2014], Ms. Martinez said, she overheard 2 passengers say they were horrified by Ebola, and joked that it would soon turn people into zombies. Ms. Martinez, dressed in tan scrubs with her identification badge hung around her neck, tucked the badge inside her coat, "so they don't retaliate against me." Medical workers who have treated Ebola patients at hospitals in Atlanta [Georgia], Dallas [Texas] and Omaha [Nebraska] have also reported being stigmatized.

The problem is severe enough that Mayor Bill de Blasio acknowledged it during a news conference at Bellevue on Sunday [26 Oct 2014]. "The medical personnel fighting this fight, particularly our nurses, deserve our respect," Mr. de Blasio said. "We heard reports in the last few days of nurses being mistreated in our city -- when it became clear that they worked at Bellevue -- being treated differently. We heard reports of people being unwilling to serve them food or treating their children differently. That is absolutely unacceptable."

But sometimes the snubbing is taking place inside their own workplace. Nurses treating CS were in tears at a meeting this week as they complained about being shunned by other staff members in the elevators, one health care worker who was there said. Workers in the isolation unit seem attuned to how their co-workers are viewing them. Some people who work in that unit are trying not to mingle with those who do not, several employees said. Even though the hospital administration has not explicitly ordered Ebola workers to stay away from others, employees said, the word has gone out through informal channels that it is better to lower the risk, and the anxiety quotient, of exposing other employees. Some nurses asked for arrangements to be made for them to sleep over at the hospital out of fears of passing the virus to their relatives and friends.

Even without the stigma, the work is both physically and psychologically taxing, and the dangers of burnout are high. Nurses have been going to group therapy at the hospital looking for support, and nurses from other public hospitals have been brought in for reinforcement. Some critical care patients have been transferred to Bellevue affiliated hospital, NYU Langone Medical Center, to free intensive care staff to treat CS, officials said.

One Bellevue health care worker said that nurses who had not completed their Ebola training were asked on Friday [24 Oct 2014] to relieve the nurse taking care of CS's fiancee. At 1st they refused, the worker said. Then one "gowned up" and was relieved to find the work consisted of making sure [CS's fiancee's] temperature was taken and entered into a log. The worker and other Bellevue employees quoted spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to discuss hospital matters. [CS's fiancee], who has shown no symptoms, has since been discharged to home quarantine in the Hamilton Heights apartment she shares with CS.

Ana Marengo, a spokeswoman for Bellevue, said on Tuesday [28 Oct 2014] that everyone who worked with CS and [his fiancee] had been fully trained.

[2] East Africa: tourism down

Ebola fears ripple across continent to hurt east African tourism
----------------------------------------------------------------
East Africa's Serengeti and Maasai Mara safari parks are as far if not further from the Ebola outbreak in the west of the continent than much of Europe which supplies the tourists, but you'd hardly guess that from the slump in bookings. In Tanzania and Kenya, tour operators say tented camps and luxury lodges where lion and elephant saunter past are surviving on visitors who have not yet written off the whole continent because of an outbreak that struck 5000 km away. "The probability of dying from a tree falling on your head is probably higher than going on a safari in the Serengeti and catching Ebola," said John Corse of Nomad Tanzania, one of whose camps overlooks plains where wildebeest make the annual Great Migration, often described as a natural Wonder of the World.

Tanzania -- which relies heavily on tourist dollars from visits to game reserves, Mount Kilimanjaro or Indian Ocean beaches -- was aiming for a record year to top the more than 1 million visitors who came in 2013. That now looks a pipedream. The Hotels Association of Tanzania, representing 195 sites nationwide, said business is down 30 to 40 percent on the year and advanced bookings, mostly for 2015, are 50 percent lower. Next door, Kenya has been hurt too. Its tourism industry was already reeling from a spate of attacks by Islamists, including last year's [2013] attack on the upscale Westgate mall and more recent incidents on the coast. Ebola has added to the pain, making dollars scarce in the foreign exchange market and weakening the [Kenya] shilling.

Safaris are vital to both nations, whose other main exports are agricultural produce, because they tend to draw wealthier visitors, ready to splash out on luxuries, like sundowners after a game drive at sites miles (kms) from the next settlement. "A safari holiday behaves like a form of luxury goods: people consume more of it when they're feeling safe and wealthy," said Corse, whose packages combining a week or so in the bush followed by a few days on Zanzibar's beaches cost USD 8000 to USD 15 000 a person. Particularly galling to some is that neither Kenya nor Tanzania, nor indeed any other east African nation, has had a single case of the Ebola virus.

The United States and Spain, meanwhile, have had cases of infection on their soil and also deaths from the disease. Madrid stands less than 4000 km [less than 2500 miles] from Liberia's capital Monrovia, a shorter distance than the game reserves of Kenya and Tanzania. Several east African nations have imposed restrictions on travellers coming from afflicted areas. Kenya Airways halted flights in August [2014] to Monrovia and Freetown after Kenya was declared a "high-risk" zone because Nairobi is one of Africa's transport hubs. However, some European airlines still fly to afflicted nations of West Africa. When 9 Kenyans returned to Nairobi from Liberia this week, they were isolated for hours and tested before being allowed to go home, even though they showed no fever or other Ebola symptoms.

"Our problems started with insecurity long before Ebola became an issue, but Ebola of course has worsened it," said Sam Ikwaye of the Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers, referring to last year's deadly attack by Islamist gunmen on a Nairobi shopping mall followed by other assaults elsewhere. "Our members have reported that tourists are very concerned and have kept asking and seeking assurances that Kenya is Ebola-free," he said. The Serena Hotels, which run high-end safari lodges and beach resorts, said bookings were down by as much as 30 percent in 2014, from the last good year of 2012. In 2013, worries about election violence, which proved unfounded, also deterred visitors.

Knock-on effects on nearby Uganda and Rwanda
--------------------------------------------
Problems for Kenya and Tanzania have knock-on effects on nearby Uganda and Rwanda, which are also part of the East African Community bloc. Rwanda, whose tourist industry in particular relies on expensive treks to see rare mountain gorillas, denies entry to travellers who have been to the 3 West African nations in the previous 22 days. Ebola's incubation period is 3 weeks. Tanzania, where most visitors come from Britain, Germany, the United States and Italy, plans to launch a website in early November [2014] to educate visitors about Ebola and debunk any rumours. "We sympathise with our brothers and sisters in West Africa. But we don't have it and we are doing everything we can to ensure Tanzania remains Ebola-free," said Lathifa Sykes, chief executive of the Hotels Association of Tanzania. "Africa is not one country. Africa is a continent," she said, voicing the frustrations of many Africans who say people in the West often forget Africa's diversity and vast size.

Still, not all tourists are staying away. At the Sarova Whitesands Beach Resort, near Mombasa, 44-year-old Wilbur April from London shrugged off the worries."Of course we asked about Kenya before we came because there was bad publicity about the country back home and we wanted to be sure," he said from his sun-bed sipping a glass of red wine. "Recently it was terrorism," he said. "Now it is Ebola, and it is not even near Kenya.

[3] USA: Opinion: How to make Ebola worse

Bill Foege on how to make Ebola worse
-------------------------------------
[Humanosphere Editor's note: Dr. William Foege is the physician-epidemiologist credited with devising the strategy that rid the world of smallpox, former head of the CDC (when AIDS 1st emerged) and, full disclosure, is also a good friend to Humanosphere. We asked him to offer perspective on all the finger-pointing attending the Ebola hysteria.]

It is easier to be a critic than a participant or helpful observer.

That goes for me as well, but I am concerned that the straight-forward, science-based approach taken by public health officials to limit Ebola's potential spread in this country has spawned such harsh criticism that the critics themselves may be a bigger risk to public safety than this virus.

It's important to realize Ebola is a living creature. Control of infectious diseases is a continuous evolutionary contest between microorganisms and humans fighting for turf. Science inches ahead as it gains more understanding of those organisms, which often leads to new medications and vaccines. Then we may find those very organisms evolving in response.

Chloroquine was once a wonder drug against malaria and we could almost see the inevitable defeat of that enemy. But the parasite found how to resist and essentially sideline that drug. Antibiotics seemed ready to make some infectious diseases obsolete. But gonorrhea defied penicillin; staph overcame many antibiotics; and tuberculosis learned to live with multiple drugs. All these organisms are too small to have a brain. Yet they figured out how to beat us.

Vaccines are better than drugs, in general, because organisms don't develop resistance. But even with these great tools, these organisms have co-opted some parents who refuse immunizations for their children. So measles and whooping cough are now able to rebound even in the face of great protective vaccines.

But humans are also ingenious. Working with the best information available, public health workers continue to change strategies. Smallpox workers evolved and suddenly a virus that had perfected its business plan for immortality was outflanked and it disappeared in a few years. Through a similar concerted global campaign, measles deaths have plummeted from over 3 million a year to less than 10 percent of that figure.

This same evolution is now occurring with Ebola. With the experience of 38 years and multiple outbreaks in Africa, the pattern seemed clear. Transmission between humans could be broken in fewer than 5 or 10 generations of the virus, a time frame of months. Humans would then remain free until the next transfer of the virus from bats to humans.

With another human case, the scenario would be repeated with intense human efforts to find cases, isolate them, treat them and avoid virus spread. Public health workers would find contacts, isolate them at the 1st sign of illness and help the community to dispose of the dead to stop viral transmission to others. Within months, the outbreak would cease.

But in 2014, the virus changed tactics and took advantage of a slow human response. The change in tactics led to a new phenomenon, spread of the virus to high population density areas. Control measures should have remained the same, mimicking the surveillance/containment strategies of smallpox eradication. But the greater volume of cases complicated isolation of patients.

The need to find, follow and refer for isolation large numbers of contacts overwhelmed an anemic public health response. Indeed, the need to find and follow all contacts of patients was not on the WHO "critical steps" list as late as October 2014. The result has been a disaster for West Africa. Half way measures are not sufficient and the public health community is now adapting and attempting to organize a large scale response.

Doctors Without Borders combined the experience of earlier outbreaks with the treatment of thousands of cases during this outbreak. They have done this under such difficult field conditions that it was assumed that most large hospitals in the United States could have done the same thing safely. That turned out not to be true and protocols quickly reflected this new information.

While the autonomy of state and local jurisdictions is a given in this country, the federal government has responded with assistance and personnel exceeding any previous investigation and control effort. Human evolution and response to unexpected problems will contain the virus in this country.

The screening of travelers is not simple and it is certainly not fool-proof. But again, public health recommendations have been tightened to improve the chances of finding people entering the country with the virus. Some of the same people critical of the public health approach seem very tolerant of politicians calling for a travel ban from affected countries or governors placing travelers in quarantine.

Past experience indicates that people are clever enough to travel to other countries 1st if they really want to come to this country. And they will hide their exposure to Ebola patients if it means being placed in quarantine. That simply increases our risk. There is no evidence that such quarantine would be better than finding contacts and taking their temperatures twice a day to detect the 1st evidence of illness.

When the governor of New York says he is instituting quarantine out of an abundance of caution, most can read the real reason as an "abundance of politics."

Will there be more cases in the United States? The chances are high that some will get past the travel-filter and that we have not as yet seen every possible error in blocking transmission in this country. But with steady and solid decisions based on past experience and new findings, the response will stop every chain of transmission promptly.

In fact, the public health response in this country has been far better than we could have expected, given the cutbacks in the public health infrastructure of recent years made worse by the private care system sometimes making decisions based on cost or insurance status rather than health needs.

Time will make clear the value of the wisdom of the advice given by the CDC and state health authorities. The hard work of thousands of health workers is not helped by media-generated panic or illogical political decisions.

Finally, as worrisome as Ebola is, it pales next to 1000 deaths a day due to tobacco, thanks to reluctant politicians over the decades, or to the more than 1000 deaths a week due to infections patients did not have when they entered the hospital, or the staggering toll of guns and influenza.

If only we, as a country, could show as much ingenuity in responding to our major health problems as we show with our criticism of the public health workers laboring to make the world safer.

[Bill Foege, while working as a medical missionary in Africa and on assignment for the CDC, came up with the strategy known as "ring containment," which led to the eradication of smallpox. In 2012, President Obama honored Foege for his public health work with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Foege is also on the board of directors for Humanosphere.]
