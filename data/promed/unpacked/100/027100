Re: ProMED-mail Lyme disease - USA: avian hosts 20100102.0024
------------------------------------------------------------
The agent of Lyme disease, or preferably, Lyme borreliosis, in the
United States is _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu stricto. The
appellation "sensu lato" has traditionally meant the entire group of
species that cause Lyme borreliosis, as well as related genospecies.
Given the opportunity, _Ixodes scapularis_ will also feed on lizards,
as they do in the southeastern US, another region with a
comparatively lower prevalence of infection in the ticks than in the
generally less hospitable regions in the northeastern US for lizards.

There is little reason to think that humans or their pets are major
or even minor agents in spread of the organism, except indirectly
through their effects on climate, landscapes, and deer management practices.

The population structure of _B. burgdorferi_ indicates that the agent
is slowly spreading from 3 relic populations in the coastal
northeastern US, an area in Wisconsin and Minnesota, and parts of
northern California (2, 3). There are strains in the midwestern US
that do not occur in the northeastern states and vice versa. Infected
birds may play some role in the spread of the agent on this
continent, but the effect may be greater in Europe (1). In North
America the contiguous spread of ticks on deer with the changing
climate and landscapes may [be] a larger contributor. Adult ticks,
which have roughly twice the infection prevalence as nymphs, feed on
other mammalian hosts, which are more competent than deer as
reservoirs for _B. burgdorferi_.

Lyme disease is not "widespread in the United States". The focal
nature of its distribution and risk is one of the features of the
disease. The great majority of Lyme borreliosis cases come from a
limited area in the northeastern US. There may be reports from
several states where transmission has not been documented, but these
may be either misdiagnoses or cases acquired in other locations.

There is no evidence that Lyme disease symptoms have been "recognized
for hundreds of years". The 1st descriptions in the medical
literature date to the 1st part of the 20th century in Sweden and Austria.

Lyme disease has not been documented in "nearly every country in the
world". There are large areas of the globe where there is either no
or insufficient documentation of _B. burgdorferi_ or a similar
species. These include South America, sub-Saharan Africa, south and
southeast Asia, and Oceania.

In my opinion, the accompanying [ProMED moderator's] comment [in
ProMED post Lyme disease - USA: avian hosts 20100102.0024] also gave
unmerited prominence to notions, based on limited or no evidence, of
roles for semen, breast milk, and insects in transmitting the
infection to or among humans. This was at the expense of more
deserved emphasis on the most common -- by a large margin -- means of
acquisition of _B. burgdorferi_ in the United States: the bite of an
infected nymphal _I. scapularis_ or _I. pacificus_ tick.
