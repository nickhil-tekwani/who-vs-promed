Suspected Equine Case of West Nile Virus Infection in Connecticut
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Preliminary laboratory results indicate a recent exposure to West Nile
virus (WNV) in an 11-year-old mare horse from the Pawcatuck section of
Stonington. On Mon 3 Sep 2001, the owner recognized the horse as being
unsteady and with weakness in its hind area. The horse was under
veterinarian care and died from its illness on the morning of Fri 7 Sep 2001.
Additional testing is underway to confirm the diagnosis. The Connecticut
Department of Agriculture has submitted additional samples from the horse
to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, for
confirmation of the presence of WNV. The Connecticut Agricultural
Experiment Station (CAES) will be setting up additional mosquito traps on
Mon 10 Sep 2001 in the area of the horse with test results within 10 days.
