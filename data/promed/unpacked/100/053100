The Division of Wildlife Resources (DWR) is puzzled by a fish kill at
Wrigley Springs Reservoir in Emery County, Utah, about 8 miles west of
Ferron. Louis Berg, aquatics manager for the southeastern region, said
the extent of the kill has not been determined but could be more than
2000 rainbow and tiger trout. "Those surviving were obviously
stressed, swimming around the shoreline," he said.
The fish began dying a little more than 3 weeks ago. As of Monday, it
appeared the devastation was ending.
The DWR has been in contact with Emery County officials and with the
people who maintain the dam at the little irrigation reservoir to see
if anyone knew of any herbicides or pesticides possibly entering the
water. No one was aware of any chemicals having been used in the
vicinity.
"Chemical analysis of the water might be possible, but we'd have to
have some idea of what we were looking for. So far we don't have a
clue what it could be," Berg said. He urged anyone with information on
what may have contaminated the reservoir to contact the DWR office in
Price. Berg said the fish didn't appear to be the victims of parasites
or a communicable disease like whirling disease.
Since the small-size fish began dying, the division has postponed
regularly scheduled fish planting at the reservoir. If the die-off is
over, the reservoir will be restocked in about 2 weeks with catchable
rainbow trout and fingerling tiger trout.

[This article has many unknowns. There is no indication of parasites
or whirling disease, but no indication of whether bacterial and viral
testing has been done. The extent of the die-off is not known, nor is
evidence presented of it having stopped. - Mod.TG
