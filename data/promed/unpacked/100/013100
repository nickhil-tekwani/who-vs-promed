Belgium's farm ministry said on Monday that a seventh case of BSE had been
found at a dairy and meat producing farm near Liege in the east of the
country. Agriculture Minister Karel Pinxten said in a statement the
diagnosis of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was confirmed on
Monday. The carcass of the infected cow, born at the farm in March 1993,
had been burnt.
The rest of the farm's 213-strong herd would also be destroyed and other
animals from the infected farm were being tracked down. Indicating the
possible cause of the disease, the ministry said cattle on the farm had
been fed with meat and bone meal.
