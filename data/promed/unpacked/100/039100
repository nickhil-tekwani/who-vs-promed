A recent review
---------------
Reported instances of transmission from hepatitis C virus infected health
care workers were recently reviewed in "Alter MJ. Prevention of spread of
hepatitis C. Hepatology 2002; 36(5 Suppl 1): S93-8." This article concludes
that: "Of the episodes linked to infected health care workers, at least two
thirds were not related to exposure-prone invasive procedures, and half
were related to the infected health care worker's substance abuse." A free
copy of this article can be obtained from:

Similar incident in Texas
-------------------------
Responding to the posting about the transmission of hepatitis C virus via
contaminated syringes used by a drug-addicted anesthesiologist, I will
confirm that there was a similar set of circumstances involving an
anesthesiologist in Arlington, Texas a few years ago. [Further details can
be obtained] by contacting the Texas Department of Health. At the time that
this became apparent, there was a flurry of media coverage, as well as a
number of lawsuits, and criminal indictments.

Similar incident involving HIV transmission
-------------------------------------------
I recall an incident about ten or so years ago. A dentist in Florida who
was infected with HIV deliberately infected several patients by drawing
some of his own blood into a syringe of anesthetic before administering it
to patients. The connection was revealed by PCR analysis and phylogenetic
comparison showing that all the infected patients carried the same HIV
sequences indicating they came from a single source. A full account of the
incident can be read in the following paper: Ou CY, et al. Molecular
epidemiology of HIV transmission in a dental practice. Science 1992; 256:
1165-71. The abstract reads: "HIV transmission from infected patients to
health-care workers has been well documented, but transmission from an
infected health-care worker to a patient has not been reported. After
identification of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patient who
had no known risk factors for HIV infection but who had undergone an
invasive procedure performed by a dentist with AIDS, six other patients of
this dentist were found to be HIV-infected. Molecular biologic studies were
conducted to complement the epidemiologic investigation. Portions of the
HIV proviral envelope gene from each of the seven patients, the dentist,
and 35 HIV-infected persons from the local geographic area were amplified
by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Three separate comparative
genetic analyses -- genetic distance measurements, phylogenetic tree
analysis, and amino acid signature pattern analysis -- showed that the
viruses from the dentist and five dental patients were closely related.
These data, together with the epidemiologic investigation, indicated that
these patients became infected with HIV while receiving care from a dentist
with AIDS."
