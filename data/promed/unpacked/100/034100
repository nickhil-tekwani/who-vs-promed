Wounds characteristic of anthrax were found on the hands and forearms of 6 residents of the Piyadalar village of the Barda region of Azerbaijan. [From this description it seems the anthrax was cutaneous, or on the skin. This form is easier to treat than some other forms. - Mod.TG]

According to transmitsvesti.az with reference to the message of the Association for the Management of Medical Territorial Divisions of Azerbaijan (TABIB), the symptoms of anthrax were detected as a result of monitoring carried out in the village on 1 Sep 2022 by a special group, based on information received from one of the residents.

The special group included employees of the Barda region, the Center for the Control of Particularly Dangerous Infections of the Ministry of Health and the Barda branch of the Republican Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology, the Barda Central District Hospital, the Veterinary Department, the Food Security Agency, employees of the Piyadalar village municipality, and employees of the district police department.

On the recommendation of a specialist doctor of the infectious diseases department of the Barda Central District Hospital at [TABIB], these persons were hospitalized in the infectious diseases department of the Central District Hospital. Samples taken from patients for laboratory testing were sent to the Mingachevir Regional Center for the Control of Especially Dangerous Infections of the Ministry of Health. The results of 3 samples were positive.

Persons with positive results of laboratory tests are being treated in the infectious diseases department of the Barda CRH.

Their state of health is assessed as stable. Patients are expected to be discharged home soon.

It should be noted the causative agents of anthrax are mainly considered to be sick animals and the land in which animals died from this disease are buried. The disease is transmitted only from animals to humans, not from humans to humans.

[The city of Barda is the capital of the Barda District in Azerbaijan. It is located south of Yevlax and on the left bank of the Tartar River (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barda,_Azerbaijan).

These individuals with the lesions may have been caring for the cattle and thus exposed on their skin. Cutaneious lesions may appear as group of small blisters or bumps, which may itch. There may be some swelling around the sore or lesion. Sores may appear as an ulcer, usually reported as painless, but often with black centers and appearing after the small bumps or blisters. These sores seem to be most common the arms and hands but can often be found on the face and neck as well. This can be treated with a variety of antibiotics, depending on the severity and the specific antibiotics available. - Mod.TG
