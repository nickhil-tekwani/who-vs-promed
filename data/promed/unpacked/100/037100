China reports new foot-and-mouth outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
China has reported a fresh outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD],
with 54 head of cattle affected in the nation's northwestern Qinghai
province. [Map at
<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2003-04/03/content_815411.htm>]
Cattle at a farm in Qinghai's Haixi Mongolian region began showing
symptoms of the illness last week, and they were diagnosed with FMD
on Thursday [27 Jul 2006], the agriculture ministry said on its
website on Friday.
A total of 98 cattle were culled following the outbreak, while local
agriculture officials quarantined and disinfected the farms and the
surrounding area, it said.
There have been at least 3 other outbreaks in Qinghai this year
[2006] of FMD, a severe and highly contagious viral disease affecting
cattle, pigs, sheep and other livestock.
It is not usually fatal but causes losses in the production of meat and milk.

[Since May 2005, FMD virus serotype Asia 1 has, according to China's
official notification, spread within 9 provinces, including Qinghai.
The authorities claimed that the disease is controlled by
vaccination; see China's last follow-up report to the OIE, dated 10
Jul 2006, at
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_10.HTM#Sec6>.
Sporadic outbreaks may occur in spite of a vaccination policy;
repeated outbreaks deserve explanation. It will help to obtain
information on the vaccination history of affected animals, their
age, the virus strains included in the vaccines, and the prescribed
vaccination scheme (minimal age, timetable of revaccinations etc.). - Mod.AS]
