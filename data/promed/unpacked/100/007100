Ticks are responsible for the transmission of many zoonoses, which are infectious diseases transmitted from animals to humans. A study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases 8 Aug 2022 [see citation and abstract below] just highlighted a new zoonosis transmitted by ticks in a remote region of Guyana. This sickness, Sparouine's anaplasmosis, was discovered following the infection of a gold miner living in the heart of the tropical rainforest. The infection of his red blood cells by a bacterium unknown until then led to a severe deterioration in his state of health and required hospitalization. This work also shows that genetically similar bacteria circulate among ticks and mammals of America from south, which could constitute the natural reservoirs of infection.

Major vectors of pathogenic agents, ticks are particularly well known in Europe for their role in the spread of zoonoses such as Lyme disease. By feeding on wildlife, ticks can then transmit zoonotic pathogens to humans. In Guyana, the exploitation of remote natural areas has led to the emergence of a new tick-borne zoonosis, unknown until then, the anaplasmosis of Sparouine.

Sparouine's anaplasmosis is at this day a rare sickness with only one known case. However, the conditions under which this disease was discovered are illustrative of the risks associated with the exploitation of remote natural areas. The Sparouine anaplasmosis appeared on an illegal gold-panning site in the heart of the tropical rainforest of Guyana. For the populations living on the gold-panning sites, the fear of the authorities hinders access to health centers, and epidemics of malaria appear there regularly. It is precisely a country study of malaria, with the examination of more than 360 blood samples, which revealed the presence of a new pathogenic bacterium, _Anaplasma sparouinense_ and thus the fortuitous discovery of the anaplasmosis of Sparouine.

During the 1st blood sample in 2019, the patient showed no particular symptom, although many red blood cells then presented cytoplasmic inclusions, indicating importance of the bacterium. Eighteen months later, the patient was admitted to the Center Hospitalier de Cayenne for fever, myalgia, headache, epistaxis, and anemia. A large microbiological investigation had then made it possible to exclude the presence of common infectious agents, and only a DNA examination led to the discovery of _Anaplasma sparouinense_. The patient presented with a comorbidity factor, having undergone in the past splenectomy following a wound, which may have aggravated the effects of the infection. Antibiotic treatment over 3 weeks fortunately led to the recovery of the patient, who was then able to leave the hospital.

This new pathogen belongs to the bacterial genus _Anaplasma_, the best-known bacterium of which is _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, responsible for human granulocytic anaplasmosis. This emerging zoonosis is responsible every year for several hundred cases, sometimes fatal. Genetic studies have revealed that _Anaplasma sparouinense_ is a new infectious agent, different from all known species of _Anaplasma_. Phylogenetic analyzes have also established that related bacterial strains are naturally present in sloths and ticks collected from coatis [a mammal native to South America, Central America, Mexico, and the southwestern United States] in Brazil.

The gold panning site, in direct contact with wildlife, was undoubtedly a determining factor for the passage of the infectious agent to humans.

It is still too early to say the importance that the anaplasmosis of Sparouine will have in the future, and what health risk the disease could then present for South American populations. Its mere existence reminds us, however, that our knowledge of the diversity of pathogens circulating in remote natural areas is still very partial. The expansion of human activities in these regions will inevitably lead populations to be exposed to the risk of the emergence of similar zoonoses.

Abstract
---------
"We report a case of unusual human anaplasmosis in the Amazon rainforest of French Guiana. Molecular typing demonstrated that the pathogen is a novel _Anaplasma_ species, distinct to all known species, and more genetically related to recently described _Anaplasma_ spp. causing infections in rainforest wild fauna of Brazil."

_Anaplasma_ species are tick-borne, obligate intracellular, rickettsia-like bacteria that infect a variety of animal hosts, including humans (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33794351/). Some infect red blood cells (_A. marginale_, _A. centrale_, _A. ovis_, _A. capra_, and _A. bovis_); _A. platys_ and _A. odocoilei_ infect platelets; and _A. phagocytophilum_ infects polymorphonuclear neutrophils. The newly described _Candidatus_ A. sparouinense infects human erythrocytes.

French Guiana (pop., almost 300 000 residents in 2022) is an overseas department and single territorial collectivity of France on the northern Atlantic coast of South America, bordering Brazil to the east and south and Suriname to the west. Half of its population lives in the metropolitan area of Cayenne, its capital, with almost 99% of its land mass covered by rainforest (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Guiana). - Mod.ML
