[Byline: Rodney Sieh]

Health authorities in Liberia are urging calm amid reports of a suspected case of the deadly Ebola virus deriving from next-door Guinea.

An official from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare confirmed to Front Page Africa early Thursday [18 Feb 2021] that tests are currently being conducted on a suspected case of the killer virus. That result, the source said, should be ready by the end of business day Thursday [18 Feb 2021].

The patient, a female, reportedly came from Guinea Wednesday [17 Feb 2021] evening and is currently at the Redemption Hospital awaiting lab work.

The patient, according to the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because they have not been given the green light to publicly comment on the case, said the patient is being treated at the Medicover Clinic, Soul Clinic Branch, and is currently in self-isolation. The clinic is also under surveillance awaiting lab result from Redemption Hospital.

Authorities confirmed that the relatives of the patient who escorted her to the clinic are being kept in isolation.

The potential index case patient reportedly returned from Nzerkoure [Nzerekore], one of the troubled spots in Guinea, a few days ago with high fever and running stomach and was on medication at a local clinic around the FDA Community in Paynesville for about 3 days before going to Medicover Clinic.

Dr. Wilhemina Jallah, Minister of Health and Social Welfare, has reportedly been briefed on the matter and is said to be making efforts to bring the situation under control.

The report of the suspected case comes amid mounting calls on the George Weah-led government to close the border with Guinea and Sierra Leone, which have reported positive cases of the deadly virus over the past few days.

The Nzerekore Region of Guinea shares borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia, where EVD outbreaks occurred previously. ...

Next-door Sierra Leone has also reported a suspected case of the virus, but that result came back negative.

A statement from the Ministry of Health in Sierra Leone reported Wednesday [17 Feb 2021] that the case, a male, is currently at the Battalion Clinic. The patient was admitted with fever, anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea but has no history of traveling outside Sierra Leone. The patient, however, traveled to Freetown on 2 Jan 2021 and stayed to the 9 Feb [2021], where he attended the 40th birthday of a friend. [Note that patient was negative for Ebola. - Mod.LK]

Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone have all activated a Health Emergency Response System to level II (enhanced surveillance, active case finding and robust community engagement).

Ebola virus disease - Guinea
----------------------
As of 15 Feb [2021], 192 contacts have been identified, including 164 contacts in N'Zerekore Health District and 28 in Ratoma Health District, Conakry. To date, no contacts have been reported to have travelled in neighboring countries. However, Nzerekore is the 2nd-largest city in Guinea and lies at the intersection of roads from Ganta (Liberia), Danane (Cote d'Ivoire), and roads to other major hubs in Guinea like Kankan and Macenta (Guinea). Therefore, there is concern about the exportation of EVD cases into the neighboring countries.

Public health response
---------------
On 14 Feb 2021, following the declaration of the EVD outbreak, the MoH of Guinea convened a crisis meeting.

The MoH, WHO, and Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partners have initiated measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread. To coordinate the response, the MoH activated the national and district emergency management committees. They also advised the public to take measures to avert the spread of the disease, and to report any persons with symptoms to seek care. Multidisciplinary teams have been deployed to the field to actively search and provide care for cases, trace and follow-up contacts, and sensitize communities on infection prevention and control. Planned and in-progress response measures include the following:

- Identify the source of the current outbreak;
- Identify and follow-up contacts of all confirmed and probable cases;
- Isolate all suspected cases, and assure their care;
- Put in place infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in health-care facilities including train staff, establish triage processes, assess PPE supplies and access to hand-hygiene resources, and implement protocols for environmental cleaning and disinfection;
- Conduct assessments of health facility IPC preparedness using scorecard and develop action plans;
- Strengthen case investigation, including active case-finding in health-care facilities;
- Alert and inform all existing care services in the region;
- Support laboratory capacities to process specimens from suspected case in a timely manner;
- Strengthen public information and awareness of compliance with prevention and protection measures, including reporting to health services as soon as the 1st symptoms appear;
- Promote safe and dignified burial of suspected, probable, and confirmed deaths;
- Initiate a ring-vaccination strategy and vaccinate frontline workers.
- Mobilize response resources;
- Strengthen the capacity of the N'Zerekore Ebola Treatment Centre
- Set up response commissions with the authorities and partners, including WHO, the Red Cross, Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), UNICEF, and UNFPA.

WHO support for the Guinean authorities
-----------------------
- WHO will help supply vaccines, therapeutics, reagents, and personal protective equipment;
- WHO will be part of the partner coordination;
- WHO will be involved in all pillars of the response and will help to strengthen response in each area;
- WHO will recruit and deploy human resources to N'Zerekore region to support investigation, contact tracing, and vaccination;
- In coordination with partners, WHO will work to reinforce risk communication and community engagement by deploying communicators and socio-anthropologists;
- WHO will provide logistic support, hygiene kits, and IPC materials where they are needed.

WHO risk assessment
----------
WHO considers the risk of spread in the country as very high given the unknown size, duration, and origin of the outbreak; potentially large number of contacts; potential spread to other parts of Guinea and neighboring countries; limited response capacity currently on the ground; and unknown virus strain. In addition, there are ongoing challenges for the public health system due to the COVID-19 epidemic, and recent yellow fever and measles outbreaks.

WHO assess the risk for the region as high. The Nzerekore Region of Guinea shares borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia, where EVD outbreaks occurred previously. Despite some movement restrictions across official border crossings due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a significant proportion of cross-border movement continues to take place and poses a risk of EVD spread. It is therefore essential that neighboring countries assess their preparedness capacities and implement readiness/response measures.

The countries in the region should
- Conduct preparedness and readiness assessment;
- Develop a preparedness and readiness plan;
- Map out immediate activities;
- Activate IMS for preparedness.

WHO advice
--------------
WHO advises the following risk-reduction measures as an effective way to reduce EVD transmission:
- Continue to train and retrain the health workforce for early detection, isolation, and treatment of EVD cases as well as on safe and dignified burials and IPC measures;
- Prepare for vaccination of health workers and implement ring vaccination around confirmed cases;
- Engage with communities in responding to the outbreak and to reinforce safe and dignified burial practices;
- Ensure availability of personal protective equipment and IPC supplies to manage ill patients and for decontamination in health-care and community settings;
- Ensure availability of biomedical equipment, essential medicines, and therapeutics to care for patients with EVD;
- Ensure implementation of a referral system: screening and triage at health centres with referral pathways to designated Ebola treatment centres;
- Conduct health facility assessments ("scorecard") of adherence to IPC measures;
- Reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission (through contact with fruit bats, monkeys, and apes) through community education on how to handle wildlife with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing, and cook animal products (blood and meat) thoroughly before consumption;
- Reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with EVD symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids: wear appropriate personal protective equipment when taking care of ill patients, and wash hands regularly including after any contact with patients or when coming into contact with any body fluids;
- To reduce the risk of possible transmission from virus persistence in some body fluids of survivors, WHO recommends providing medical care, psychological support, and biological testing (until 2 consecutive negative tests) through an EVD survivors care programme.
Based on the current risk assessment and prior evidence on Ebola outbreaks, WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to Guinea.

https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2021-02-18-more-than-11000-ebola-vaccines-expected-in-guinea-this-weekend-who/

WHO regional director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti told a news conference that 11 000 doses were being prepared in Geneva, while 8600 more doses would be shipped from the United States. [Thus, almost 20 000 doses. - Mod.LK]

Mohamed Lamine Yansane, a senior adviser to Guinea's health minister, told the news conference that as soon as the vaccines arrive in Guinea on Sunday [21 Feb 2021], the vaccination campaign can start on Monday [22 Feb 2021].

Health authorities in the region and international organisations aim to halt a resurgence of the disease in Guinea and Congo to prevent a repeat of the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11 300 people, mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, making it the deadliest Ebola epidemic on record.

"We think that it's not likely at all that we will have a similar situation . . . as happened in the past," Moeti said, adding that there has been a very rapid response in both countries building on previous experiences.

The WHO has already asked 6 African countries to be alert for possible Ebola infections after Guinea reported new cases and Democratic Republic of Congo said new infections there were a resurgence of a previous outbreak.

With efforts gathering pace to promptly tackle the new Ebola outbreaks in Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the World Health Organization (WHO) is deploying teams of experts to support the national authorities and ramp up the response and avert widespread infections.

Health authorities in Guinea declared an Ebola outbreak on 14 Feb [2021] after 3 cases detected in Gouecke, a rural community in N'Zerekore prefecture, tested positive for the virus. It is the 1st Ebola outbreak in Guinea since 2016 when a large one was successfully brought under control.

More than 100 WHO staff, deployed from other countries and from within Guinea, are expected to be part of the Ebola response by the end of February [2021]. A team of 8 experts from the WHO Regional Office for Africa in Brazzaville is leaving soon. Efforts are ongoing to step up surveillance, contact-tracing, testing, and treatment as well as preparing for vaccination.

"We are hard at work, shifting quickly through the gears to get ahead of the virus. With experts and emergency supplies already getting on the ground, the response is off to a strong start," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. "Our collective, quick action is crucial to averting an uncontrolled spread of Ebola amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already pushed health workers and health facilities to the edge."

A humanitarian flight arrived on 15 Feb [2021] in N'Zerekore with 700 kg [1543 lb] of medical equipment donated by WHO and partners. A consignment of more than 11 000 doses of Ebola vaccine is expected to arrive in Guinea this weekend. In addition, more than 8500 doses will be shipped from the United States of America for a total of 20 000 doses. Vaccination is set to kick off shortly afterwards. A 30-strong vaccination team has already been mobilized locally and is ready to deploy as soon as the vaccines are received.

Meanwhile, in the DRC, so far there are 4 confirmed Ebola cases, including 2 deaths that are epidemiologically linked. WHO has around 20 experts on the ground supporting national and provincial health authorities. About 8000 vaccine doses were still available in the country at the end of the 11th Ebola outbreak. The vaccination of people at high risk was officially launched in Butembo, the outbreak's epicentre on 15 Feb [2021]. So far nearly 70 people have been vaccinated. The quick rollout of vaccines is a testament to the enormous local capacity built in the previous outbreaks by WHO and partners.

WHO has released USD 1.25 million to support the response in Guinea and to reinforce Ebola readiness in neighbouring Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. Additionally, the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund has disbursed USD 15 million to support the response in Guinea and DRC and readiness in the neighbouring countries.

With the epicentre of the Ebola outbreak in Guinea being a border area, countries in the sub-region are on high alert and increasing public health measures and surveillance in border towns and communities to quickly detect and respond to possible cross-border infections.

The ongoing response in Guinea and preparedness in neighbouring countries is building upon the experience gained during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. WHO and partners worked with national teams to build capacity in all the critical areas of surveillance and response.

- Thu 18 Feb 2021 12:20 p.m. EST. Key questions and lessons
[The Conversation, abridged, edited]
https://theconversation.com/ebola-strikes-west-africa-again-key-questions-and-lessons-from-the-past-155566
[Byline: Mosoka Fallah]

News of a new outbreak of Ebola in Guinea is indeed distressing. The last in West Africa occurred between 2014 and 2015 and affected Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. It was the world's deadliest Ebola outbreak, which began in Guinea and in which more than 11 300 people died. Among these were over 500 health workers.

But countries in the West African region are in a very different position 7 years on.

Liberia and Sierra Leone have already mobilised and activated their national response and preparedness plans, a clear indication that the political will is there.

Countries in the region also have the experience of the past, as well as new tools to tackle Ebola. They have an experienced workforce, laboratory systems are more developed, and regional organisations, such as the Mano River Union -- a regional economic and security body -- and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), are more proactive.

For example, one of the outcomes of a 2018 planning meeting in Freetown, Sierre Leone, was to prepare for cross-border transmission. A WhatsApp platform was developed that provided for real-time tracking of outbreaks. It is now operational and is being used to transmit updates from Guinea to the surveillance and response teams from member countries.

However, as Pierre Formenty, the head of the World Health Organisation's viral and haemorrhagic fever team, once pointed out to me, the worst mistake anyone can make about Ebola is to underestimate Ebola, or to think they know all about Ebola.

I'm an infectious disease expert and have led national response teams in previous Ebola outbreaks. A fundamental lesson I've learned is that the success of a control strategy is not based on the obvious information you have, but the subtle unanswered questions. I learnt this the hard way.

One particular incident has stayed with me. In early August, 2014, I met with Liberia's WHO Representative, who asked me how West Point was doing. West Point is Liberia's largest slum and is located in Monrovia, Liberia's capital. I said, with great confidence, that it was very quiet and had no ongoing Ebola transmissions. However, at that very time, there were active Ebola transmissions in the area and secret burials were happening in the early morning hours. The cases in West Point exploded.

It's crucial to keep digging and keep questioning. I've compiled a series of questions which are key to preparedness strategies, and which all countries in the region should address.

Key questions
There are some key biological questions that those leading surveillance and contact tracing need to answer.

1) The 1st is: How long was the 1st case sick before they died?
Answering this question is crucial so that neighbouring countries can trace possible times a sick person -- or contact from the current cluster -- may have come into their country. Many of the cases spread through the region in this way during the 2014-2015 outbreak. Many people crossed over to escape an outbreak or seek help.

Ebola does not kill within a day. The virus has an incubation period of between 2 and 21 days. People get progressively sicker as the virus multiplies in their bodies. Some studies from the previous outbreak in Guinea indicted an average of 8 days from the onset of symptoms to death.

Having a timeline is crucial to understand who they might have passed the virus on to.

2) The 2nd important question is: What was the source of infection? How did they get infected?
This helps surveillance teams identify whether the person was the index -- or 1st -- case and can identify their contacts. If this isn't known, it means the source of the infection is out there, and there could be multiple cases around.

Once the 1st case is infected, we know it spreads from human to human through direct contacts, fluids, dead bodies, and contaminated materials from an infected person.

3) The final and most serious question is: What strain of Ebola is being dealt with?
Vaccines are available for the Ebola Zaire strain, but not for others. Reports I've received indicate that the current outbreak in Guinea is due to the Zaire strain.

There are also critical epidemiological questions that needs to be answered quickly too:

a) How many contacts -- meaning people they came into contact with -- has the 1st recognised case generated so far?
It is crucial to find 100% of the contacts. Missing just one can lead to an outbreak. This will require tracking movements, interviewing families, friends, and places they might have sought treatment. This is where the complex detective work of contact tracing kicks in.

In the case of this recent outbreak in Guinea, infected persons had attended the burial of a nurse. Knowing this is vital because it allows the team to begin to map the potential spread of the disease.

In this case, the fact that it's a funeral and that she was a nurse, indicates that this is a super-spreader event.

Funerals are often attended by relatives who might have travelled long distances to get there, and possibly even from other countries. Action can be taken on this basis: neighbouring countries are put on alert. In 2016, border checks worked. We were able to catch cases that had escaped from Guinea to seek refuge with relatives in Liberia.

The fact that she was a nurse points to a bigger, undetected outbreak.

b) What is the alert case's demography? This includes age, ethnicity, occupation, and economic activities.
All these are pertinent in understanding who the person might have come in contact with.

For instance, in 2014, an infected case from Guinea crossed over to Sierra Leone to seek care from a traditional healer among her ethnic group. This set the stage for the biggest outbreak in Sierra Leone, which then spilled over into Liberia.

c) What were the person's movements, and how many places did the person visit when they became ill?
This includes hospitals, clinics, and traditional healers. A transmission map must be built that examines all the possible movements and transmissions. If the index case moved using public transport, vehicle logs and movements for other passengers are needed.

In Liberia, we worked with transport unions, visited hospitals, and pored over patient records. We worked with commercial motorbike riders to piece these complex transmission maps to determine the total number of contacts, locations, and status. The reason this is critical is that in the control of Ebola it is an "all or nothing principle." You must reach 100% contacts and follow them up and ensure that none escape or get sick and die in the community. Otherwise, there's a new transmission chain.

Until each of these very complex questions are answered, neighbouring countries should operate under the assumption that cases are in their countries. There is already an alert of a suspected case in Liberia that came from Guinea.

Next steps
The governments of these countries must sustain the high levels of alertness and preparedness they have initiated. Everything must be done to ensure Ebola doesn't enter densely populated areas.

Surveillance must be carried out, especially in border towns. Symptoms surveillance teams must look out for fever, headache, joint pain, and redness of eyes. Surveillance activities should also screen for ethnic groups to which sick people belong. It's better to pick up all potential cases, rather than risk missing one.

There should also be visits to all hospitals and clinics in bordering towns. Patient records must be checked.

Any medication and vaccines that can treat the disease must be on the ready to be deployed rapidly.

And finally, Ebola starts and ends in the community. It's crucial to activate, educate, and empower communities to say something and report something when they see something.

[Among the questions is the index case. It is not clear whether the 70-year-old mother-in-law of the nurse was the actual index case after a misdiagnosis. None of the hospital staff caring for her became infected except her daughter-in-law, the nurse who is considered the index case. But her symptoms were consistent with those of Ebola. This is why a point-of-care test is important to have in place in countries where Ebola is enzootic. Similarly, there should be a stash of protective gear always available, and vaccine stock in a repository readily accessible. - Mod.LK]

[This short video is worth watching. A reporter interviews an Ebola survivor, a male whose sperm still tests positive at times, 2 years after recovery. Whether the sperm is infectious is not known. Persistent infection in testes leading to infected sperm was likely the source of this most recent 12th outbreak in the DRC. But fortunately, the case count has not increased since the 4th case was identified. This is fortunate since only 4 rooms are available for patients. Vaccination has been underway since Monday [15 Feb 2021], and a large number of people are immune after having been vaccinated in the last outbreak: all good news. - Mod.LK
