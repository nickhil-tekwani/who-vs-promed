Indonesia: Two more human cases of H5N1 virus infection
-------------------------------------------------------
Two more people in hard hit Indonesia, a 15-year-old girl from an
upscale Jakarta neighbourhood and a 30-year-old man in West Java,
have [contracted] bird flu, a Health Ministry official said on Tue 6
Feb 2007. The girl, who lives in the capital's Menteng district where
many high ranking officials and foreign diplomats reside, had caught
a wild bird which died 2 days later, Joko Suyono of the Ministry's
bird flu centre said.
The West Java man lived in an area where many poultry had died, he said.
Indonesia, where most people keep chickens, has had more human deaths
from the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus than another other
country -- 63. Six people have died this year [2007] in a country of
17 000 islands and poor infrastructure where most bird flu victims
have caught the disease from contact with infected fowl.
Altogether, the virus has killed 165 people in 10 countries [now 11
with one death in Nigeria - Mod.CP] and scientists fear it could
mutate into a strain that spreads easily among people, triggering a
pandemic that would sweep the globe.

[This report is exceptional in that the 15-year-old girl who has
tested H5N1-positive may have contracted infection from a wild bird,
which died subsequent to capture, rather than by contact with
domestic poultry. If these most recent 2 positive tests are verified,
the number of confirmed human cases of H5N1 virus infection in
Indonesia will rise to 83. - Mod.CP]
