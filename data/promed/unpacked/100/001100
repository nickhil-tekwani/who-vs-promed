[Neither vaccination nor stamping out seems to have been applied in
North Korea, according to the report; the continued spread of the
virus should, hence, not be surprising. The FMD situation in North
Korea has been subject to reporting by an FAO/OIE experts mission
which visited there between 27 Feb and 8 Mar 2011; see in archived 20110325.0950. Among their recommendations, the experts included the
need to forward samples to an international reference centre for
genotyping. Hopefully, this submission will eventually be carried out,
as implied in the epidemiological comments.

According to the report, all 4 described outbreaks have been
"resolved". It will be interesting to note which criteria are applied
to regard an outbreak as "resolved:" the reported time lapse between
the start of outbreaks and their being resolved was only 4 days in one
outbreak (number 2) or 10 days (outbreaks 1, 4).

South Korea has confirmed to the OIE, on 18 Apr 2011, its renewed FMD
outbreak, affecting pigs in Gyeongsangbuk-Do. See at
