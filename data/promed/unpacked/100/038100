Tocantins recorded 74 cases of visceral leishmaniasis and 3 deaths from the disease between January and October this year [2022]. The data were released this Monday [7 Nov 2022] by the State Department of Health (SES-TO).

Visceral leishmaniasis is a serious vector-borne disease that, if left untreated, can lead to death in more than 90% of cases. One of the deaths took place in Paraíso do Tocantins and another 2 in Porto Nacional.

Another form of the disease is cutaneous leishmaniasis, which had 250 confirmed cases in Tocantins this year [2022]. No deaths were recorded.

The disease cycle involves dogs as hosts and the "straw mosquito" ["mosquito palhas," but presumably meaning _Lutzomyia_ sandflies - Ed.], which is the vector responsible for the transmission of the disease. The disease control plan is made by calculating the risk in each municipality, drawing up action plans with strategies to be implemented throughout the year.

"Basically, the focus is diagnosis, and treating all possible human cases. In due course, carry out educational and social mobilization activities, in addition to actions aimed at controlling reservoirs/hosts [dogs] and vectors", explained Júlio Bigel, technical advisor at SES.

According to SES, the state started the control program with the collaring of dogs in municipalities with the highest risk of contamination. The action is done with collars impregnated with insecticide to try to control the disease.

For early diagnosis, people should be aware of the clinical manifestations of the disease, both in children and adults. Symptoms include an enlarged abdomen and long-lasting fevers.

The diagnosis can be made by means of rapid and laboratory tests, which are performed at the Central Public Health Laboratory of Tocantins (Lacen). The test is also made available in the municipalities by municipal laboratories and health units.

[According to WHO figures, Brazil accounts for 96% of all cases of human visceral leishmaniasis (HVL) in the Americas. Canine VL is also widespread, with up to 20% of dogs infected in the highly endemic localities. The fatality rate related to HVL and cases of HVL-HIV coinfection have increased over the years (https://leishinfowho-cc55.es/country-profiles/b/).

Tocantins is a state in central Brazil. According to an area risk classification of HVL in Brazil, certain municipalities in the central and northern portions of Tocantins have intense transmission and high average case counts of HVL (see Figures 1 and 4 in Ref. 1). The OneHealth approach taken by the Tocantins public health authorities, which includes measures to prevent and control the infection is dogs, is commendable. Unfortunately, nationwide interventions implemented under the Brazilian Visceral Leishmaniasis Surveillance and Control Programme have not been successful in reducing transmission and human cases, especially in urban areas (Refs. 2,3).

Misiones Public Health issued an alert for a suspected case of visceral Leishmaniasis. According to the official report, the case is a 34-year-old man from the rural area of Eldorado.

On Thursday night [3 Nov 2002] he went to the emergency room for bleeding in the stool and a nosebleed, in addition to the fact that this man explained that 6 months ago he had a fever and weight loss.

When parasitic forms compatible with leishmaniasis, both intracytoplasmic and free, were detected in their analysis, the doctors launched the protocol for cases of visceral leishmaniasis, with hospitalization and specific treatment with liposomal amphotericin and transfusion support.

Despite the fact that the case was treated as positive due to the symptoms and the presence of the parasite, they still sent samples to LACMI [ Laboratorio de Alta Complejidad de Misiones, High Complexity Laboratory of Misiones province] to confirm visceral leishmaniasis by PCR.

After having discovered the case of visceral leishmaniasis in a man from Eldorado, the director of Environmental Sanitation provided details about the disease and the procedures for possible cases.

The 1st thing that is done after medical diagnosis is the placement of traps in areas inhabited by the sandfly. These traps contain a light to attract sandflies. The traps are left at the optimal time, which is overnight and then the next day they are removed. The next procedure carried out by the Zoonosis Center is to study the sandfly and determine if it has consumed blood. Subsequently, chemical spraying is carried out in the vector's habitat.

Regarding the current case, on Thursday [10 Nov 2022], the municipality of Eldorado will conduct a survey of dogs in the area through serological testing. The procedure will continue on Friday [11 Nov 2022] with the placement of the sandfly traps and by the next day they will have figures on whether or not there is presence of leishmaniasis.

[Human visceral leishmaniasis is an emerging disease in Argentina that has been found in Misiones, Santiago del Estero, and Salta provinces (Ref. 1). Misiones province is in the extreme northeast of the country, straddling both Brazil and Paraguay. Argentina's 1st autochthonous case of HVL occurred there in Posadas in 2006, and was subsequently reported in 2014 in Puerto Iguazú, the Argentine gateway to the world-famous Iguazú Falls (Iguaçu Falls in Brazil). The case reported above is from El Dorado, which is located between Posada and Puerto Iguazú along Highway 12, which roughly follows the course of the Paraná River between Brazil and Argentina. The immediate testing of local dogs and captured phlebotomine sandflies to ascertain the presence of _L. infantum_ in the area is an excellent complement to parasitological and PCR testing of the human case.

A recent seroprevalence study of dogs in Puerto Iguazú found a rapid increase in canine infection with _L. infantum_, which is concerning because canine visceral leishmaniasis has been shown to precede outbreaks of HVL in Argentina (Ref. 2).
