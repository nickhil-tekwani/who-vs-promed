Brazilian town has outbreak of Chagas disease
---------------------------------------------
A Brazilian town has an outbreak of Chagas disease, the government of
the northern province of Amazonas said Monday [11 Jan 2010].

A total of 12 people, including 4 children, were infected in the
municipality of Santa Isabel do Rio Negro after eating "acai," a kind
of food produced from a palm tree, said Evandro Melo, a provincial
official. Melo said the cases were diagnosed on 4 Jan 2010.

In 2007, Amazonas province also had reported an outbreak of Chagas
disease because of acai, registering 46 cases without deaths.

[ProMED has reported several outbreaks of orally transmitted Chagas
disease since the first outbreak in Santa Catharina in 2005 (see
below). The largest outbreak of orally transmitted Chagas was an
outbreak in a school in Venezuela in 2007. Fruit or palm juice have
been implicated in all of the outbreaks, apparently contamined with
triatomid bug feces or crushing entire bugs during the process of
producing the juice. Â– Mod.EP]
