The 1st case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) for the summer has been recorded in NSW.

A man who lives in Lake Cargelligo, around 7 hours inland from Sydney, has been diagnosed with the mosquito-borne virus.

He likely caught the infection early last month [November 2022], NSW Health said.

The state's Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for eligible residents to get vaccinated against JE -- a potentially fatal disease that can cause severe neurological illness with headaches, convulsions and reduced consciousness.

Last month [November 2022] a map was released showing the locations most at risk for the virus, which includes the Lachlan Shire area.

NSW Health is urging anyone who lives or routinely works in any of the below Local Government Areas [map available at source URL] to get vaccinated against JEV.

"Mosquitoes in NSW can carry a range of viruses, including Murray Valley Encephalitis virus, Kunjin virus, Ross River virus, Barmah Forest virus, as well as JE virus," McAnulty said.

"Vaccine is only available for JE, so avoiding mosquito bites is the most important way of preventing these infections."

People who live in affected areas can get a free vaccination if they often work outdoors.

JE vaccination clinics are being planned by the Murrumbidgee Local Health District for Lake Cargelligo in early January [2023].

A case of Japanese encephalitis has been identified in a man from the Riverland [South Australia], where there is an ongoing flood emergency.

SA Health said the man, in his 80s, was the 1st identified case of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in the state this mosquito season and was likely to have "recently acquired" the infection.

SA's Chief Public Health Officer Professor Nicola Spurrier said the man was recovering at home after spending a "number of days" in hospital.

"Fortunately, even though he developed encephalitis he recovered and he's now back home so that's good news," she said.

"We know that people can be infected by this virus and have no symptoms whatsoever ... but about one in 250 people develop symptoms and then we can make that diagnosis."

Symptoms of JEV include confusion, headaches, tremors, drowsiness, neck stiffness and seizures.

SA Health said there had been 10 confirmed JEV cases in South Australia this year [2022] and 2 deaths.

Professor Spurrier encouraged South Australians to remain vigilant and avoid exposure to mosquitoes, and get vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis if eligible.

"Think about going and getting it done now because of course you need a little bit of time for your immune system to kick in to protect yourself and you just don't know if the mosquito that bites you is the one that's carrying that disease," she said.

"We've had over 15 000 vaccines provided and we have 26 000 in total so there's still a lot of vaccine there and its not going to do any good for anybody sitting in the fridge, it needs to be in people's arms," she said.

Professor Spurrier said JEV was a "very serious condition" that "can affect anybody of any age".

Professor Spurrier said avoiding getting bitten was important for all South Australians, particularly as other mosquito-borne diseases had been detected in the environment.

SA Health recommends wearing long, loose-fitting and light-coloured clothing, applying mosquito repellent to exposed areas of skin and clearing mosquito breeding sites by emptying or covering anything that holds water.

Professor Spurrier said vigilance would likely be necessary for a prolonged period.

"I think we'll have lots of mosquitoes for quite a long time over this summer period," she said.

"As soon as we get this warm weather they will breed and they will explode in numbers.

"And there is a lot of water and as the main peak of the flooding goes through and that subsides, there will be lots of pools of water and it's that stagnant water where mosquitoes just love to breed."

[There was a question about the likelihood of active Japanese encephalitis persisting with cooler, drier weather or perhaps disappearing from the 4 states that experienced the earlier outbreak in 4 states involving pigs and humans. With the onset of cooler weather, transmission to pigs and humans ended, but the question remained if the virus had become endemic and transmission would resume when warmer weather returned. In mid-November 2022 the NSW Health Executive Director, Dr Jeremy McAnulty said the detection of JE in pigs in the region was made as part of planned ongoing surveillance for the mosquito-borne virus. The November 2022 and the 2 above reports indicate that transmission has resumed. Over the past several weeks, health authorities have warned those living in areas of risk to become vaccinated. The November 2022 report indicates that ongoing surveillance of pigs and mosquitoes detected transmission to pigs. Now, there are 2 human JE cases one in New South Wales and the other one in South Australia. Given the increase in vector mosquito breeding sites due to flooding in South Australia, extensive increases in JE virus transmission are expected. One hopes that the vaccination efforts will intensify and individuals will take the preventive measures listed above to avoid mosquito bites. - Mod.TY
