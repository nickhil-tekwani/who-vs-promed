The [Chinese] government is deeply concerned by reports that some
Filipino students have fallen ill after eating Chinese-made milk
candies, the spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce said. A special
team of food safety experts will be sent to the Philippines if
necessary to assist in the investigation, the spokesman said. He
declined to reveal the name of the candies.

Some 23 schoolchildren fell ill on Thursday [4 Oct 2007] after eating
milk candies imported from China and were sent to hospital in Cebu,
the Philippines, according to local reports. They were all discharged
a day later [5 Oct 2007], reports said.

Pending the results of the investigation into the incident, local
stores have been asked to temporarily stop selling the candies.

In response, the Chinese government directed its Cebu consulate to
immediately look into the matter and submit a report.

Late last month [September 2007], the Philippines banned the sale of
imported Chinese food products at school canteens in response to
reports that the goods contained cancer-causing formaldehyde.

Among the products tested by the top food watchdog in the Philippines
and found to contain formaldehyde were White Rabbit milk candies and
Yong Kang Foods grape biscuits.

Formaldehyde, a colorless, flammable gas, has been classified as a
human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research and as a
probable human carcinogen by the US Environmental Protection [Agency].

[Formaldehyde is most often encountered in the work place as a vapor
causing damage by inhalation and eye irritation. But it is not always
in a vapor state. It can be found in a liquid as formalin and can be
ingested. Ingestion of as little as 30 ml of a 37 percent solution of
formaldehyde (formalin) can result in death. Gastrointestinal
toxicity after ingestion is most severe in the stomach and results in
symptoms, which can include nausea, vomiting, and severe abdominal
pain. Diverse damage to other organ systems including the liver,
kidney, spleen, pancreas, brain, and central nervous systems can
occur from the acute response to ingestion of formaldehyde.

This article does not indicate the level of formaldehyde, nor does it
indicate how severely the children were affected. However, thy should
be followed as cancer is often associated with formaldehyde exposure.
