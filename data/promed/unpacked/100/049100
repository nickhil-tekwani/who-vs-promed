State Health Director Leah Devlin today announced confirmation of the
state's first human case of West Nile virus (WNV) infection. Dr.
Devlin said that the individual, a resident of the town of Henderson
in Vance County, was diagnosed with encephalitis thought to be a
result of a recent infection with WNV. The patient, an 80-year-old
man, was hospitalized in Durham, but is now at home recovering from
the illness. The State Public Health Laboratory confirmed the man's
exposure to West Nile Virus.
"West Nile virus is neither new nor unique to us," Dr. Devlin
emphasized. "We identified West Nile virus in a crow in the fall of
2000, and we're quite familiar with 3 other mosquito-borne viral
diseases seen in our state, La Crosse encephalitis, St. Louis
encephalitis, and eastern equine encephalitis. These mosquito-borne
viruses are about equally dangerous to humans, which means that it is
always prudent to take proper precautions."
West Nile virus is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, primarily
members of the _Culex_ species. So far this year, North Carolina has
confirmed WNV in 107 birds from 30 counties. In 2001, 2 blue jays, 6
crows, 6 horses, and 3 sentinel chickens tested positive for WNV. The
number and location of cases of the arbovirus cases for each year can
be found at
<http://www.deh.enr.state.nc.us/phpm/html/confirmed_positive.html>.
The NC Department of Environment & Natural Resources (DEN) remains on
the lookout for West Nile virus and other arboviruses that mosquitoes
can transmit to humans, including La Crosse encephalitis and eastern
equine encephalitis. DENR regularly collects mosquitoes, dead birds,
and chickens from special "sentinel" flocks maintained at various
strategic points around the state. DHHS, DENR and the NC Department
of Agriculture cooperate in the statewide surveillance system. The
Public Health Lab has performed 472 tests for human WN virus.
North Carolina residents can help identify areas that might be at
risk for West Nile virus by reporting dead or dying crows, blue jays,
and birds of prey to their local health departments. Birds reported
should be dead no more than 36 hours. Birds can also be reported to
the Public Health Pest Management Section at 1-877-790-1747.
