Measles alert in northern Virginia
----------------------------------
Health workers in northern Virginia are trying to track down hundreds of
people who may have been exposed to measles. A 15 month old child from
northern Virginia contracted the disease in India in February [2008].

The Fairfax County Health Department was notified of the toddler's
condition on 7 Mar 2008. The child had been inside the Harris Teeter
grocery store on Woodland Park Drive in Herndon, as well as Fairfax Inova
Hospital's emergency room and the Capital Area Pediatrics clinic in Herndon
on 3 occasions.

Measles has an average gestation period of 3 weeks and health workers
believe that potentially-exposed people would most likely show symptoms by
19 Mar 2008 at the latest. In all, about 500 people were believed to have
been exposed to the child. This is the 1st reported case of measles in
Virginia since 2001. No other cases have been reported so far.

Measles is a very aggressive, airborne illness that results in a high fever
and rash. While a majority of patients can recover from measles on their
own, serious complications can occur, such as inflammation of brain tissue,
or encephalitis. Children in the United States receive vaccinations against
measles as well as mumps and rubella, in a combination MMR shot. This
vaccination is effective for life.

[The USA remains vulnerable to the reintroduction of measles virus via
unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children and adults coming from
countries where measles is still prevalent (which essentially is much of
the rest of the world). In this instance the concern seems premature as no
secondary cases have been identified. The infected child has been treated
at local clinics, however, and health care facilities in other situations
have been associated with onward transmission of measles virus. Perhaps the
proximity of Hernodon to the nation's capital is the reason for this alert.

The state of Virginia can be located in the interactive HealthMap of the
United States whjch is accessible at <http://healthmap.org/promed?

County which can be located via the map at
