State health officials say 12 Eddy County residents have received a series of rabies shots in the most concentrated outbreak of the viral illness in New Mexico in decades. Thirty-two pet dogs have been euthanized this year in the Carlsbad area, most after tangling with rabid skunks. Health officials tell the Albuquerque Journal they have confirmed rabies in 22 skunks and a fox in Eddy County.

Each year, about 50 to 70 New Mexicans receive post-exposure treatment for rabies. But health officials are alarmed by the concentration of 12 treatments in a single county within 2 months.

The cause of the outbreak appears to be a combination of a large skunk population and the region's extended drought forcing skunks to look for food in areas where there are people and pets.

[While this article seems to indicate a bit of alarm about the number of rabies post exposure prophylaxis [PEP] for humans exposed to the disease, there does not seem to be evidence of a rabies drive to vaccine pets.

Creating a barrier between wildlife and humans is important to reduce the number of rabies PEP. The best way to create that barrier is to protect our pets by vaccinating against rabies. Our pets often come in contact with the rabid animal and then in contact with the owners or other humans.

If authorities are alarmed about this situation then perhaps we will hear more about their efforts to mobilize drives to get pets vaccinated against rabies.
