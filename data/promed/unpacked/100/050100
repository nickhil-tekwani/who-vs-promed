The spate of seasonal diseases in twin cities took another turn, with
authorities on Sunday [6 Sep 2009] confirming the presence of
chikungunya in twin cities [of Hyderabad].

The Nallakunta Fever Hospital had received a patient with chikungunya
like symptoms from Amberpet. Laboratory tests revealed that the
patient has tested positive for chikungunya.

The district authorities informed that medical teams are fanning out
the Amberpet area to find mosquito breeding grounds, as chikungunya,
a vector-borne ailment, spreads by the bite of the _Aedes_ mosquito.
"Our surveillance has improved because now we are coordinating with
private hospitals. Earlier, only Fever Hospital cases used to get
reported. Now, private hospitals are reporting cases directly to us."
says District Medical and Health Officer Ch Jaya Kumari.

It may be recalled that it was in 2006 when chikungunya and dengue
broke out on a large scale in the State capital and elsewhere.
Chikungunya is a debilitating, but non-fatal, viral illness spread
through _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, which are infected by chikungunya
virus. It is not a contagious ailment and is only spread through
mosquito bites. The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes only bite in during day time.

Chikungunya starts suddenly with fever, hills, headache, nausea,
vomiting, joint pains, and rashes. "Only supportive treatment like
analgesic is given for pains. Getting plenty of rest and isolation
from mosquitoes and symptomatic treatment should be given," Dr Jaya
Kumari said.
