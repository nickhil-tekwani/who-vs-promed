An 8th Princeton University student has been diagnosed with meningitis, a potentially fatal infection that causes swelling of the brain and spinal cord, a university spokesman said on Friday [22 Nov 2013].

Health officials will conduct tests to determine whether the latest case is related to the previous 7 that have been identified since March 2013. Officials at the New Jersey school could not provide the current health status of the student.

The latest case comes shortly after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allowed the university to use an imported vaccine to help control the disease's spread. The past cases at the Ivy League school were caused by the meningococcal bacteria known as serogroup B. State law requires all Princeton students living in dormitories to receive a meningitis vaccine that protects against most strains but not the serogroup B variety, Princeton spokesman Martin Mbugua said in an email.

The outbreak of serogroup B meningitis is rare but not the 1st of its kind in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC].

Bexsero, made by Swiss drug maker Novartis AG, will be provided to all undergraduate students, graduate students who live in university housing on or off campus, and students and faculty with certain illnesses, such as sickle cell disease, Princeton officials said earlier this week. The FDA has allowed the use of the vaccine at Princeton under an Investigational New Drug application. The federal CDC considers the drug to be safe. "Everyone involved is working hard to organize a potential serogroup B meningococcal disease vaccine campaign as quickly as possible that fits into Princeton University's academic calendar," said CDC spokeswoman Sharon Hoskins. The Princeton inoculation campaign is set to be voluntary for students and is expected to begin in early December 2013, with another event in February 2014, according to the school's website.

Federal and New Jersey state health officials have not advised visitors or students to avoid the campus, Mbugua said. Meningitis is a serious disease that is spread through coughing and exchanges of saliva, and people living in dormitories or other crowded living quarters are especially at risk. The most severe cases can result in death, hearing loss, brain damage, kidney disease, or amputation of limbs. Symptoms include fever, headaches and stiff neck.

Another case of meningitis has been confirmed at Princeton University, bringing the total number of cases to 8 this year [2013]. As WCBS 880's Marla Diamond reported Friday [22 Nov 2013], the female graduate student developed symptoms on Wednesday and was hospitalized on Thursday [20-21 Nov 2013].

Health officials are still investigating whether the student has the same type B strain that has infected 6 other students and one visitor since March 2013, Diamond reported.

Under state law, anyone living in dorm rooms must have vaccinations against other strains of meningitis. The vaccinations, however, do not cover type B.

Earlier this week, the Food and Drug Administration, along with school officials, approved importing a vaccine not yet approved in the U.S. for limited use at the New Jersey campus. The vaccine, Bexsero, is approved for use in Europe and Australia.

A case of meningitis was also reported at Monmouth University this week [see below], although the strain has been not been disclosed.

A suspected case of meningitis has been reported at Monmouth University. As WCBS 880′s Peter Haskell reported, the university was notified late Wednesday [20 Nov 2013] that an employee is believed to have contracted the condition. The man works in the controller's office, and a cleaning crew was sent in immediately, "...and did a cleaning and sanitizing of the area," school vice president Mary Anne Nagy told Haskell. "The university has sought the involvement of all the experts in this [event]."

The worker is hospitalized and said to be in grave condition. The university has already had an open meeting with students. "We want to also make sure that people understood it is not spread through casual contact," said Nagy. "We will continue to be vigilant." Still, some students said they were worried. "Especially because the school is so small," Nicole Desarno, of Garden City, Long Island, told CBS 2′s Dave Carlin.

The school says state and regional health officials have been notified, and they are in touch with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help guide the university's response. A school spokeswoman says it is unclear which strain of meningitis the employee might have contracted. The state health department said it will take a few days to make a determination.

The case comes as Princeton University is dealing with several reported cases of meningitis. Health officials do not believe the strains at Monmouth and Princeton are the same.

[The 1st 2 news releases above report an 8th case of meningococcal meningitis in a Princeton University student, and the 3rd news release reports one case of meningitis in an employee at Monmouth University, about 42 miles (68 km) east of Princeton in the U.S. state of New Jersey. We are told that the serotype on the 8th Princeton case is pending, and the microbial etiology of meningitis in the Monmouth University case is reported as pending, although it does say that health officials do not believe the pathogens at Monmouth and Princeton are the same. Please see the recent ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (03): (NJ) college, sg. B, new vaccine 20131117.

Monmouth University, with 4300 full-time and 444 part-time undergraduate students and 1750 graduate students, is a private university located in the borough of West Long Branch, Monmouth County (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monmouth_University). Monmouth County is in the central portion of New Jersey, along the Atlantic coast.
