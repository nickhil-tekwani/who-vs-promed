re: Isolation of West Nile virus from the Big Brown Bat, _Eptesicus fuscus_
----------------------------------------------
In view of the reported isolation of West Nile virus (WNV) from 3 Big Brown
bats in Albany County, NY, the following information concerning studies
with closely related flaviviruses in bats my be of interest to some.
[1 There is an extensive literature on St Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV)
and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in bats dating back to the 1950s. Lou
La Motte did some experimental work at Johns Hopkins where he demonstrated
survival of JEV in _Eptesicus fuscus_ under simulated over-wintering
conditions. An abbreviated summary of La Motte's paper follows:
La Motte, L.C., Jr. 1958. Japanese B encephalitis in bats during simulated
hibernation. Amer. J. Hygiene 67:101-108.
"Three species of bats, _Eptesicus fuscus_, _M. lucifugus_, and _P.
subflavus_ were shown to be susceptible to infection with JEV by the sub-Q
[subcutaneous route of inoculation, by mosquito bite, and, in 1 case by
the oral route. The infection of the adult bat resulted in a viremia
lasting for 6 or more days, without clinical illness or pathological
changes. The concentration of the blood virus was generally above the
minimal infectious dose for the _Culex pip-quinq
[pipiens-quinquefasciatus_ group of mosquitoes. A mosquito-bat-mosquito
cycle was demonstrated in the lab. This study showed that bats are capable
of maintaining a latent [persistent virus infection for as long as 107
days when held under simulated hibernation conditions. When the bats were
removed to room temperature no virus was immediately detectable, but in 3
days a viremia occurred. The titers following hibernation were above the
minimal infectious dose level for mosquitoes. A mosquito-bat-mosquito cycle
is suggested as a possible over-wintering mechanism for JEV." _E. fuscus_,
the big brown bat, is the same species as the 3 bats from Albany County,
NY, from which WNV reportedly was isolated.
[2 John Cross reported isolation of JEV virus from bats, and insects found
inside the same cave, in Taiwan.
Cross, J.H. et al. Japanese encephalitis virus surveillance in Taiwan II.
Isolations from Mosquitoes and Bats in Taipei Area 1969-1970. J. Formosan
Med. Assn. 7):681-686.
[3 There are extensive reviews on the subject of arboviruses and bats, one
of which follows:
Sulkin, E.S. and R. Allen 1974. Virus infections in bats. Monographs in
Virology Vol. 8:1-103.
Some of the work on SLEV in field-collected bats is difficult to interpret
because of the presence of Rio Bravo virus (a related flavivirus)
frequently found in the brown fat of bats. This confuses the antibody
picture and makes serologic results difficult to interpret.

[ProMED-mail is indebted to Dr. Mitchell for drawing attention to these
interesting observations. Over-wintering in a hibernating mammal should now
be considered as an additional factor which may facilitate the survival of
West Nile virus in North America. -Mod.CP
