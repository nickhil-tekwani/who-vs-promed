STAPH. AUREUS, VANCOMYCIN RESISTANCE - JAPAN (06)

Many of you have called me regarding reports of vancomycin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus in Japan, so at Mike Saubolle's suggestion, I am
summarizing what I know.
My laboratory has received the strain from Dr. Hiramatsu in Japan and has
confirmed the isolation of a strain of Staphylococcus aureus (ID confirmed
at CDC) with a vancomycin
MIC of 8 ug/ml (broth microdilution). [MIC = minimum inhibitory
concentration; the higher the number, the greater the antibiotic resistance
- Mod.JW]
The disk diffusion zone size was 18-19 mm. It is an MRSA strain [MRSA =
multi-drug resistant Staph. aureus - Mod.JW] that is susceptible to
synercid, arbekacin (an MRSA drug used in Japan), but few other drugs.
It was isolated from a surgical site infection of a 4 month old boy who had
been treated with vancomycin for 29 days without improvement.
Ampicillin/sulbactam was added to his regimen and he improved, but
relapsed and developed an abscess at the surgical site 12 days post
therapy. Additional therapy with arbekacin and ampicillin/sulbactam
along with drainage of the abscess cleared the infection, and the baby
was discharged and has apparently been well since.
Thus, by NCCSL definitions, the strain was not resistant, and the
case was not fatal, although it has been reported as such in several news
stories.
Similar MRSA strains (by PFGE), although with vancomycin MICs
of only 2-4 ug/ml, have been seen in several hospitals in Japan.
Screening on BHI agar in Japan with 4 ug/ml of vancomycin held for 48
hours at 37C reveals growth of strains that have post induction MICs of
4-8 ug/ml. In other words, strains with initial vancomycin MICs of 2-4
jump to 4-8 after exposure to vancomycin. The strain described above
has a stable MIC of 8 in our hands at CDC. Dr. Hiramatsu describes this
strain as "homoresistant" and the others as "heteroresistant" to
vancomycin, much like oxacillin. The strain called Mu-50 described above
is negative for vanA, vanB, vanC1, vanC2, and vanC3. The mechanism of
resistance is unknown.
There are several points to be made:
1.) Such strains have not been recognized in the U.S.
2.) The organism was obtained from an undrained abscess.
3.) Normal doses of vancomycin should have been effective in
eliminating the strain if present in blood.
4.) Information on additional cases or treatment failures in Japan
is not available.
5.) The case information will be published in the Journal of
Antimicrobial Chemotherapy in July.
6.) An MMWR on vancomycin resistance in staphylococci and
recommendations for infection control from CDC will follow in August.
This pretty much exhausts my information on the purported VRSA
(dare we call it VISA?) from Japan. I hope you find this information
useful. I'm sure it will raise a number of issues, however, I'm not
sure that I will be able to answer them. We are working with a draft
guideline for hospitals now but the details have not been approved by
the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee, so I ask
your patience in not asking me a variety of infection control questions
at this point in time.

discussing this case during his presentation on June 12 at the APIC
