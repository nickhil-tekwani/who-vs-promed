Rabies outbreak spreads to the north coast of Bali
--------------------------------------------------
We now have a confirmed case of rabies in East Bali, at Kubu, which is on
the coast, just north of the tourist diving resorts Tulamben and Amed. We
also had positive cases north of Ubud in Petang, about half way from the
original case on the south coast to the north coast. Thus, a year after
rabies was identified on the isolated Bukit peninsula, south of the
Denpasar airport, cases have now been identified throughout the heavily
populated south east and eastern portions of Bali.

So far no cases have been identified within the major cities of Ubud and
Gianyar, and only a few on the outskirts of Denpasar the capital city, but
cases now have occurred on all sides of these densely populated and
trafficked communities.

These latest cases are of particular concern because my dog-counting
canvases done in August and September 2008, just before the 1st rabies
cases were identified, found far more dogs relative to humans in the
semi-rural residential areas in the hills than in the cities. There were
open areas with no dogs or people between villages, but within the villages
the conditions were precisely those under which rabies becomes most
dangerous: lots of people and animals living in very close proximity.

It suspects that the Kutu case may have resulted from dog trappers
transporting dogs through there to Singaraja, where there are some
notorious dog meat restaurants. This is possible. Transportation of dogs
from known rabies areas to the dog meat restaurants has continued nonstop
since the arrival of rabies.

Dog vaccination against rabies was prohibited throughout Bali before the
1st cases were identified, was then allowed only in areas with identified
outbreaks, and only within the past few weeks has been permitted throughout
the island. However, there is still a critical shortage of vaccines, and
the vaccines deployed by the government during the 1st 9 months of the
outbreak required revaccination within 3 months. The 3-year vaccines have
only just begun to be used.

The following are 16 of the 17 known human deaths so far:

Age / Date of death / Place of residence
6 / 10 Oct 2009 / Tabanan
49 / 7 Oct 2009 / Tabanan
78 / 16 Sep 2009 / Tabanan
47 / 14 Sep 2009 / Tabanan
24 / 6 Sep 2009 / Tabanan
21 / 6 Sep 2009 / Tabanan
62 / 22 Aug 2009 / Tabanan (age also stated as 55)
46 / 26 Mar 2009 / Ungasan peninsula
46 / 23 Mar 2009 / Uluwatu
45 / 30 Jan 2009 / Ruken
32 / no date / Bukit
3 / no date / Kutuh
28 / 23 Nov 2008 / Ungasan
3 / no date / Ungasan
32 / 13 Nov 2008 / Ungasan
4 / 17 Sep 2008 / Ungasan
The 17th was recent. I am expecting the details soon.

A man, originally from Flores was the 1st person to be bitten by a rabid
dog, in July 2008. The dog belonged to a friend, who was also from Flores.
Whether the dog was transported to Bali from Flores, and when exactly the 2
men arrived, I have not yet been able to find out.
