Patients in a new _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Weltevreden outbreak live in Nevada and Arizona, but health officials say there may be people in other states who have been infected. Virtually no details were released 8 Jun 2021 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revealed the outbreak in a weekly data table.

Today [10 Jun 2021], a spokesperson from the CDC said the most recent patient to become ill had symptom onset in late April 2021. Six people have been confirmed as outbreak patients. "If the information we collect indicates that there could be an ongoing risk to the public, we will issue a Food Safety Alert," the CDC spokesperson told Food Safety News. Neither the CDC nor the FDA [has] reported how long they have been aware of the illnesses.

In its CORE outbreak data table, the FDA reported that investigators have begun traceback efforts, but they have not identified a specific source of the pathogen. Most _Salmonella_ infections come from contaminated food. Very small amounts of the microscopic organism can cause serious illnesses in humans.
