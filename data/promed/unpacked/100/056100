Wilting disease threatens lettuce crop
--------------------------------------
Growers in Arizona are concerned with the spread of a wilting disease present in soil that can damage lettuce. Lettuce wilt can kill the plant, if infected early, causing whole fields to be destroyed.

Plant breeders are creating types of lettuce resistant to wilt, and researchers are evaluating how effective a range of tools -- including crop rotation, field flooding and delayed planting -- might be in combating the disease. "Right now, the only solution is to not grow lettuce in the particular field that's infested with it, and eventually, you run out of fields to grow lettuce in," said Paul Brierley, Center of Excellence for Desert Agriculture, University of Arizona.

Brierley identified lettuce wilt as a problem in urgent need of more research. The disease was first seen in Japan in the 1950s, and is now present in California and Arizona, as well as in Argentina, Brazil, Italy and Iran, among others

[Fusarium wilt of lettuce is caused by the fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _lactucae_ (synonym _lactucum_). Symptoms include leaf yellowing, tip burn, and necrosis, as well as browning of vascular tissues and rotting of the tap root. Plants of any age are susceptible. They may be stunted and fail to form heads, infected seedlings wilt and may die. Disease incidence can range from a few plants up to large areas within a field.

The pathogen occurs in soils worldwide and is commonly found on roots of healthy plants. Most strains cause no damage to their hosts, but severe strains can block the water conducting xylem and lead to wilting. Three races are known to cause disease in lettuce, with up to 70 per cent crop losses reported. Lettuce cultivars have been reported to differ significantly in susceptibility, with some leaf and romaine types highly resistant. Disease severity may also depend on fungal populations in the soil, inoculum levels, and temperatures. Once introduced to an area, the fungi may survive indefinitely on the roots of asymptomatic reservoir hosts. Thus, resistant lettuce varieties and rotation crops can contribute to an increase in soil inoculum.

Spread occurs mainly on contaminated seed, with soil, infected crop debris, irrigation water and human activities (for example on farm machinery). Disease management requires an integrated approach including crop rotation and phytosanitary measures to avoid spread to new fields. For related fusarium pathogens, flooding of fields has been reported to reduce fungal survival in the soil.

In the US, the disease was reported first from California in 1990 and later from Arizona (ProMED-mail post 20030922.2393). It now affects all major lettuce production areas in both states.

Different strains of the fungus cause wilting diseases with serious losses in other crops, such as banana (Panama disease), guava, vanilla, date palm, and a range of cucurbits. Each pathovar is highly specialised attacking only a single crop species.
