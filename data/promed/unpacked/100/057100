Only 2 species of great apes are found in Gabon, the common chimpanzee
(_Pan troglodytes_) and the Western Lowland Gorilla (_Gorilla gorilla
gorilla_). Only the chimpanzees kill and eat duiker [antelope. Mammal
prey includes other primates (including human infants in extremely
rare cases!), bushpigs, rodents, hyraxes, and bushbucks. They eat
several bird species, ants, termites, wasps, and grubs. The eastern
gorilla is mainly frugivorous, eating larger fruit and mature stems,
with the only animal prey being termites, caterpillars, and other
insect larvae.
Gorillas and chimpanzees in this area may be sympatric but they don't
mingle. Feeding areas are sometimes shared but gorilla and chimp
troops take turns feeding. The relationship is one of keeping a
healthy distance from one another if they are sympatric.
As gorillas and chimps differ in their diet with regard to meat, I
believe that the duiker is not our missing link BUT the 2 apes share
much of the same diet. Now which of these types of foods are consumed
by duikers?
Common foods of both species: termites, insect larvae, leaves, fruit,
pith, bark, stems, herbs.

Chimps do this; gorillas don't. Also, chimps and gorillas usually
occupy separate habitat and don't fraternize, although they might come
into conflict under circumstances of displacement due to logging or
warfare.
Of possible relevance here might be that either a chimp or gorilla
carcass would be readily scavenged by humans, not just for meat but
also for parts used in various kinds of animist ceremony, and/or sold
for souvenirs.
Finding the evidence, however, would be complicated because chimps and
gorillas, although heavily poached, are both nominally protected
species, and anyone in possession of their remains would have a motive
to lie about what they have and where it came from.
A duiker [antelope would also readily be scavenged. These are
commonly caught with wire snares, and have sometimes been dead for a
couple of days before their remains are collected.
Are people really sure this outbreak is Ebola and not some other type
of hemorragic fever, or a confluence of Ebola in some cases and
something else in another? I'm not aware of any previous outbreaks of
Ebola ever being definitively traced to ungulates. If that occurred,
Ebola would logically be a disease of livestock, and would accordingly
almost certainly be much more common and better known. [Correct. No
virus isolations have been made from these gorillas, chimps, or
antelope. They could have died of 3 -- or more -- different causes. -

Just a comment - when I was in Peace Corps in Gabon in the mid-80's,
duiker, which were locally known as gazelle, was one of the most
common meals we ate "au village." It seems that if the gorillas and
chimps had been infected through eating gazelle, there should be more
human cases through the same route, as opposed to being infected by
eating the chimp itself. [That is a good point. However, were you in
what is now known to be an Ebola-affected area of Gabon? The
infection may be localized, like yellow fever. - Mod.JW

Chimpanzees cooperatively hunt, kill, and eat monkeys and sometimes
bushpigs. When they get duikers [antelope, it is usually [a
solitary [chimp. In all types of meat-eating, sharing occurs, but not
always, i the hunter is alone and stays that way. [Gorilla cannibalism
following infanticide is known from the Virunga population, but that
is the only type of carnivory that I know of from the species.
Regarding the infection chain, it would seem that monkeys are more lik
ely the intermediate host, given that they are more common prey,
closer phylogenetically to apes, and do harbor viruses resembling
HIV2, which is transmissible [by blood.

Regarding apes and Ebola, gorillas do not hunt other mammals and are
strictly vegetarian, therefore duikers [antelope are unlikely to
provide a missing link through the food chain in this way.
However, in parts of Gabon and the Congo (and elsewhere), apes and
duikers (and obviously dozens of other mammal species) are known to
share pools sometimes deep within the forest, for drinking and
bathing -- which may indicate several potential routes for
transmission. If it is determined that apes and duikers have died as a
result of Ebola infection, I would think it important that these
communal gathering places, animals visiting them, and invertebrates in
or near the water are investigated. The ecological significance of
these 'watering holes' can be assumed by the numbers of animals
visiting them. Many of these have been only recently discovered by
western science during forest expeditions. Assuming that these places
or others like them have been frequented by forest animals for
hundreds if not thousands of years, certainly the possibility exists
that such infections and cycles of transmission have been around for
just as long.
Whatever the source, perhaps Ebola in humans (as perhaps with Marburg,
and as suggested for HIV: Gao et al, Nature, Vol. 397, pp. 436-441,
Feb. 4, 1999) is just another knock-on effect of encroachment and the
expansion of the bush meat trade?
