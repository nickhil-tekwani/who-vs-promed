The number of pig farm samples that are confirmed positive for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in the last week was 23, and there was one premises with dual infection of PEDV and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV).

For the latest week -- 30 Nov to 6 Dec 2014 -- there were 23 newly confirmed positive premises for PEDV and 4 presumed positive. For the same period, no premises were confirmed for PDCoV and 1 presumed positive. There was 1 confirmed premise with a dual infection (both PEDV and PDCoV) and 2 presumed positive.

The total numbers of confirmed positive premises for the latest week were 551, 25 and 20 for PEDV, PDCoV and the dual infection, respectively.

Since 5 Jun 2014, for PEDV, there have been 568 confirmed positive premises, 344 presumed positive and 9 previously positive premises that have attained negative status. For PDCoV, the total for the same period are 27, 25 and 2, respectively. For the dual infection, the totals are 20, 26 and one, respectively.

There are currently 33 states with at least one confirmed positive case of PEDV, following the addition of Hawaii in mid-November 2014.

For the current week (30 Nov 2014), there were 110 PEDV-positive laboratory accessions, bringing the total since 5 Jun 2014 to 2103. Iowa reported 18 of these new cases; Kansas, 13; North Carolina, 12 and Minnesota, 11. Also reporting positive results in this most recent week were California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin.

There are currently 17 states with at least one confirmed positive case of PDCoV.

For the current week (30 Nov 2014), there were 5 PDCoV-positive laboratory accessions, bringing the total since 5 Jun 2014 to 204. There were 2 positive premises each in Iowa and Illinois and one in Minnesota.

[See USDA APHIS Figure 2. PDCoV: Cumulative confirmed and presumptive PDCoV-positive premises since 5 Jun 2014.]

There are currently 13 states with one or more confirmed positive cases of the dual infection with both PEDV and PDCoV [USDA APHIS].

These 2 diseases are closely related. There are small differences in the viruses, but the unique similarity between them is the havoc they are causing for the swine industry. - Mod.TG]
