A horse stabled in the Grand Prix Village (located outside of the Palm Beach International Equestrian Center [PBIEC] in Wellington, Florida) was tested for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1); the animal tested negative for the nasal PCR (polymerase chain reaction) swab, but positive on blood test, according to a statement from show organizers Equestrian Sport Productions.

The affected horse has not shown any neurologic signs and there are no sick or horses or horses with positive EHV-1 tests on the PBIEC property, the statement relayed.

According to the statement, "The horse that was tested was never on the PBIEC property and was isolated on the private property in Grand Prix Village. However, 2 horses from that Grand Prix Village farm were moved into the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) stabling at PBIEC. Within FEI stabling, those 2 horses had no other horses directly next to them or behind them, and those 2 horses couldn't touch noses with other horses. The closest horses to the 2 exposed were across a 12-foot [3.7 m] aisle.

"On the evening of Tue 26 Feb 2013, the 2 horses from Grand Prix Village that were in FEI stabling were moved back to their farm in Grand Prix Village on the recommendation of the state veterinarian and that farm in Grand Prix Village is under quarantine."

The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has temporarily closed FEI stabling, the release said. No horses will be allowed to enter or leave until tests from the 2 horses from Grand Prix Village who were moved to the FEI stabling are returned at approximately 4:00 p.m. tomorrow [28 Feb 2013], the statement said.

EHV-1 is highly contagious among horses and camelids and is generally passed from horse to horse via aerosol transmission (when affected animals sneeze/cough) and contact with nasal secretions.

Despite a state quarantine issued on Wednesday [27 Feb 2013] for all horses at the HITS [Horse shows In The Sun] showgrounds, the organizers of the Ocala Circuit are going on with the competition.

The quarantine was issued by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Service Division of Horse Industry after 5 more horses, which were no longer on the grounds, tested positive for the equine herpesvirus (EHV-1).

No horses are allowed to leave Post Time Farm off US 27 near Ocala. Organizers will allow anyone who wants to compete onto the grounds, but once there, his or her horse cannot leave until the quarantine is lifted, which could take as long as 21 days.

It was not clear Wednesday [27 Feb 2013] how long the quarantine would last. About a week ago, tent No. 7 at the show grounds was quarantined after a horse housed there tested positive for EHV-1. Since then, no other horse on the grounds has tested positive.

"They said it could be a few days or up to 2 weeks," HITS spokeswoman Kristen Vale said of the quarantine.

The new cases all came from horses no longer on the show rounds, but which were housed in tent Nos. 3 and 6. The farms where the horses are currently found, including a 5th in Marion County, were all placed under quarantine.

The show is scheduled to run until 17 Mar 2013. Vale said there were approximately 1300 horses currently on the grounds and all scheduled competitions will continue.
