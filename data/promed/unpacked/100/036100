From: Barbara Paul <BPaul@ORA.FDA.GOV>

For a number of years I worked as a healthcare professional in
Nigeria, where malaria is prevalent. My job in the clinical
laboratory included diagnosis of malaria through the presence of the
parasites in blood smears. It was a challenge to find parasites in
the blood of those (mostly American) patients who had been taking
prophylaxis. It seemed much more straightforward to practice constant
vigilance for early symptoms of malaria with immediate initiation of
the full course of quinine drugs. That was my survival strategy as a
foreigner who lived in Nigeria for 8 years.
Could this be a better strategy than the wholesale insistence that
the soldiers take a drug they fear because of possible side effects?
Also, could long-term prophylactic treatment lead to the emergence of
more resistant malaria strains?

[Standby emergency treatment is usually regarded as an option in
areas with much lower risk than western Africa, although I agree that
it often ends up being the method long-term residents use. It is
assumed that being a long-term resident in a highly malarious, area
you acquire knowledge of the disease, how to treat it, and where to
go if you fell ill. Most important, the use of emergency standby
treatment is a decision of the individual long-term resident
hopefully based on knowledge and understanding of the disease and its
symptoms.
The situation is very much different in military personnel (or
tourists for that matter), who stay for short periods and have many
other things to concentrate on. Even if you treat as soon as the
symptoms start, you will probably be sick for at least 3 to 4 days
and tired for a week afterwards, and longer if treatment is delayed
for a couple of days after the symptoms start. This is unacceptable
in either military personnel or tourists, and some people will ignore
symptoms and start treatment late, with the risk of fatalities. With
an attack rate of 44 percent as reported here, self-treatment --
compared to prophylaxis -- would put 44 percent out of action for a
week or more. Exposing people to a high risk of a potentially deadly
disease when effective prophylaxis is available does not seem
ethical. - Mod.EP]
