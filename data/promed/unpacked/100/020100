In Tbilisi, a 49-year-old woman died of Crimean-Congo [hemorrhagic] fever. As reported in the infectious diseases hospital, 2 days ago [Wed 21 Jul 2021] she was taken in a grave condition from the Akhaltsikhe clinic [in Samtskhe-Javakheti].

According to the hospital, the patient received all the necessary treatment in the intensive care unit, but due to the severity of the disease, it was not possible to save her.

According to existing information, the woman went to the local clinic late.

For reference, the Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever is a viral disease of animals and humans, the main carrier of which is the tick (_Hyalomma_).

A 49-year-old woman died of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever at the Tbilisi Infectious Diseases Hospital. The fact was confirmed by the clinic to the regional publication "Samkhretis-karibche".

The patient is a resident of the Samtskhe-Javakheti region in southern Georgia. 2 days ago [21 Jul 2021], she was taken to the capital's hospital in critical condition.

"Her condition was dire. The patient was placed in the intensive care unit, but it was not possible to save her, the processes had already gone so deeply," the hospital said.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an especially dangerous natural focal disease characterized by fever, severe intoxication, and hemorrhages on the skin and internal organs. It was first identified in 1944 in Crimea. The disease is widespread and is caused by a tick-borne virus [_Orthonairovirus_) of the [Nairoviridae] family.

Carriers of the CCHF virus include a wide range of wild and domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats. Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks, and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing subsequent tick-animal-tick cycles to continue with subsequent tick bites. Although several types of ticks can become infected with the CCHF virus, the main vectors are ticks of the _Hyalomma_ species.

The CCHF virus is transmitted to humans either through tick bites or through contact with infected blood or animal tissues during and immediately after slaughter. Most infections occur in industrial livestock workers such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians.

Human-to-human transmission can occur through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other body fluids of infected people.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for the reports on the fatal case of CCHF from Tbilisi, Georgia.

"CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and western and south-central Asia. The main vector transmitting the virus, the _Hyalomma marginatum_ tick, is widely distributed across southern and eastern Europe. Humans may also become infected through direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. In the WHO European Region, cases of human CCHF infection have been reported from Albania, Armenia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Kosovo, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine, as well as Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, with Turkey being the most affected country."
(https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/CCHF-annual-epidemiological-report-2018.pdf).

The National Center for Disease Control and Public Health (NCDC) of Georgia Crimean-Congo reports that "hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) vectors are spread over the entire territory of Georgia. The 1st case of laboratory confirmed CCHF in Georgia was detected in 2009 and the 2nd in 2012 in summer, at the Centre of Infectious Diseases, AIDS, and Clinical Immunology of Georgia." Antigens of the CCHF virus (CCHFV) have been detected in serological surveys of rodent populations and in _Ixodes_ ticks (https://www.escmid.org/escmid_publications/escmid_elibrary/material/?mid=8661).

According to a recent systematic review and meta-analysis by Monsalve-Arteaga L, et al, in 2020, the seroprevalence in Georgia is approximately 2.8% (https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0008094).

CCHF has the potential for human-to-human transmission. Early clinical diagnosis and laboratory confirmation of cases are essential to initiate treatment and implement protective measures. Prevention of CCHF infection is achieved by avoiding or minimising exposure to infected ticks: using tick repellent, wearing protective clothing, and removing ticks quickly and correctly. Contact with the blood or tissues of infected animals and humans should be avoided. - Mod.UBA
