More than 20 cases [of scrub typhus] have been reported in the district [Baitadi] since mid-July [2021], health officials say. Doctors at the District Hospital in Baitadi have warned local residents to stay alert and aware of the increase in scrub typhus cases.

Cases of scrub typhus, a mite-borne bacterial infectious disease, have been increasing in the district this season, doctors say. Last year [2020], the hospital had received only 2 to 3 scrub typhus cases during the monsoon season. This year, since mid-July [2021], 22 scrub typhus cases have been reported in Baitadi, according to the data of the District Hospital in Baitadi. In the past one week, the District Hospital has been receiving around 4 scrub typhus cases on a daily basis.

Scrub typhus, also sometimes called bush typhus, is an infectious disease that is caused by the parasite _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a mite-borne bacterium, and spreads in the human body after they are bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.

"Our hospital is receiving scrub typhus patients every day. We have requested health posts in the district to stay on high alert and immediately refer patients showing symptoms of scrub typhus to the hospital," said Harish Pant, information officer of the hospital.

"Scrub typhus can be treated if the infected gets immediate medical care. However, in Baitadi, most of the scrub typhus patients are found self-medicating at home and seeking medical help only after their condition has worsened," said Pant.

"Some scrub typhus patients require hospitalisation. The District Hospital has been receiving many scrub typhus patients this season so we have started testing every fever patient for scrub typhus now," said Dr Basantaraj Joshi, chief at the District Hospital in Baitadi.

High fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache, joint and muscle pain, dull red rash, nausea and vomiting are some of the symptoms of scrub typhus infection. Bleeding may occur in critical scrub typhus patients, which could lead to organ failure and turn fatal if left untreated.

The District Hospital is currently receiving over 25 fever patients on a daily basis. "Among them, up to 5 patients need admission for treatment," said Pant. According to Suresh Karki, in charge of the health post in Pancheshwar Rural Municipality Ward No. 1, the number of fever patients visiting the hospital has increased significantly in recent days. "Our health post has been receiving over 20 fever cases on a daily basis. Among them, there may be some cases of scrub typhus too. We send patients to the District Hospital if they show symptoms of scrub typhus," Karki said. "Scrub typhus can claim lives if left untreated. That is why we have expanded testing at the hospital. Also, people should be wary of insect bites during the monsoon."

Nepal saw a surge in scrub typhus cases after the 2015 earthquakes. 3 months after the earthquakes, the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences in Dharan had alerted the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division about 6 children with unusual fever and severe respiratory features. The outbreak escalated in 2016, when 831 cases of scrub typhus and 14 deaths were reported in 47 districts across the country.

[The diagnosis of scrub typhus in Nepal has increased since the 2015 earthquake, with 101 cases of scrub typhus in 2015, 831 cases in 2016, and 1435 cases in 2017-2018. This had been attributed to people living in temporary shelters where they might have been exposed to infected chiggers (larval mites), but some of this increase may be due to enhanced surveillance for this disease.

Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and an eschar at the site of the chigger bite; confirmation requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region. The Weil-Felix test is unreliable (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16941792) and molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may not be available in endemic regions.

The laboratory method by which the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made in these patients is not stated.

Doxycycline is the drug of choice and it is preferred over other tetracyclines for treatment of scrub typhus; it is rarely associated with staining of teeth in children younger than 8 years (1). Macrolides, such as azithromycin, are also reported to be efficacious (2). Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, have been reported to be clinically effective in the treatment of scrub typhus in a few patients. However, some clinical studies suggest that fluoroquinolones are not as effective in patients with scrub typhus as other antibiotics (3,4,5).

Baitadi District, with a population of 250 898 residents in 2011, a part of Sudurpashchim Province, is one of the 77 districts of Nepal, in the western region on the border with India (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baitadi_District).
