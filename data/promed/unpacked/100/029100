Authorities said 58 cases of people suffering from anthrax have been recorded in eastern Zambia's Chama district, state media has reported. Minister of health Chitalu Chilufya said the affected people are currently undergoing treatment and added that no deaths have been recorded, according to the Zambia Daily Mail on Monday [10 Oct 2016]. "We have not recorded any death as of now, but I can confirm that currently there are a total of 58 cases of people suffering from the disease and responding well to treatment and have been confined," he said.

Anthrax broke out in the district among hippos in September 2016 with 44 animals affected, but the disease was not recorded among human beings. People in the district have since been urged to desist from eating meat of dead animals such as hippos and buffaloes, adding that the dead animals have been a source of the outbreak. A team of health experts is currently in the district in order to bring the outbreak under control.

[Frankly, we have a confused reporting situation with the species affected flipping and flopping. This report quotes the Zambian minister of health saying that 58 people have been affected, and this would appear to be authoritative. The Bloomberg report of 6 Oct 2016 [see 20161006.4541306] had 22 people affected. So the number of human cases has nearly tripled within the intervening week. So much for advice not to go near dead hippos. Fortunately, no deaths have been reported. - Mod.MHJ
