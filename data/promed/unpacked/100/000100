1st Report of Soybean Rust Caused by _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ on Dry
Beans in South Africa.

During April 2004, a 150-sq-m dry bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_) plot
growing adjacent to rust-infected soybean (_Glycine max_) at Cedara
Agricultural Research Farm (29 deg 32 min S x 30 deg 16 min E) was
observed to be infected with 2 distinct rust types. Common bean rust
(caused by_Uromyces appendiculatus_) with reddish brown uredinia and
black telia was readily identified. A 2nd rust with smaller
sporulating uredinia (1.0 to 1.5 sq mm), which were gray in
appearance, was also found. Visual rust severity on the dry bean
plants, which were in mid pod-fill, was high (approximately 30 to 40
percent disease incidence).
20 plants were examined and observed to be infected with both rusts.
With microscopic examination of no fewer than 20 leaves per plant,
the urediniospores from the smaller lesions were determined to be
morphologically similar to _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ (3). Real-time
fluorescent polymerase chain reaction assays on 6 leaves and sequence
analysis of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region
2 (1) verified the identity of the urediniospores as _P. pachyrhizi_.
Although _P. vulgaris_ is a known host of _P. pachyrhizi_, to our
knowledge this is the 1st time since the arrival of soybean rust in
2001 that _P. pachyrhizi_ has been observed on an alternate host
plant in South Africa (2). Since dry beans are grown all year in
frost-free areas, the implications are that dry beans may serve as an
important overwintering host and source of inoculum for seasonal
soybean rust outbreaks.

[Asian soybean rust (ASR) has an extensive natural host range that
includes several major food crops, including pigeon pea (_Cajanus
cajan_), lima bean (_Phaseolus lunatus_), garden pea (_Pisum
sativum_), azuki bean (_Phaseolus angularis_) and cowpea (_Vigna
unguiculata_). The fact that ASR has appeared on common bean in South
Africa would indicate that dry rust is likely to become a factor in
dry bean production. Dry beans are the most important leguminous food
crop in Africa. Africa is considered to be a secondary center for
bean genetic diversity. In Africa, women on small farms are the
primary bean growers. Farmers plant about 3 million hectares of beans
annually in eastern, central and southern Africa, usually as a
mixture of varieties.
The common bean has been, and continues to be, the most important
grain legume for direct human consumption in the world. Its total
world production exceeds 12 million tons, of which some 7 million
tons are produced in Latin America and Africa. This tonnage
represents almost twice that of chickpea, which is the 2nd most
important grain legume. -Mod.DH]
