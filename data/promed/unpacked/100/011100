S&M International Inc., Bayonne, NJ is recalling Yang Sheng cooked salted duck eggs, because they have the potential to be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_, a bacterium which can cause serious, life-threatening illness or death. Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does not look smelled or spoiled.

Botulism, a potentially fatal form of food poisoning, can cause the following symptoms: general weakness, dizziness, double-vision, and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distention, and constipation may also be common symptoms. People experiencing these problems should seek medical attention.

The recalled eggs were distributed between August to October 2012 to stores and markets located in the New York City area, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Michigan. This product is vacuum packed in plastic with 6 eggs per 12.69 ounce package, UPC code 6949682803568. The lot code, YS12-02C, is printed on the product boxes.

The recall was initiated after it was discovered through NYSDAM Sampling, which revealed the product was not processed in a manner to prevent growth of _Clostridium botulinum_. S&M International Inc. reached the decision to recall this product after a thorough investigation. The company has taken a number of corrective steps to address the issue.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
