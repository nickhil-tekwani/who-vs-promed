Georgia: Health Officials Point to Outside Source for Hepatitis Outbreak
------------------------------------------------
Health officials believe food distributors or farms, rather than specific
restaurants, may have been the source of an outbreak of hepatitis A in Georgia.
Prepackaged vegetables or salads, which often are not washed before being
served, could have been responsible for hepatitis in at least 170 people
who contracted the illness in September 2003. "We are looking for a
perishable item that was probably around in mid-August," said state
Division of Public Health spokesman Richard Quartarone on Fri 3 Oct 2003.
"It could go all the way back to the farm environment."
Quartarone stated that the cases have occurred in the northern and central
parts of the state, including metro Atlanta. Georgia normally has about 400
cases of hepatitis A each year. In August 2003, health officials said at
least 100 people were infected in northeast Georgia around Gainesville
during the first half of the year.
The disease infects about 23 000 Americans each year. It is usually spread
through fecal-oral contact, e.g., by touching hand to mouth after using the
bathroom or changing a diaper. Generally it causes mild illness, with a few
days or weeks of fever, nausea, and jaundice. There is no long-term liver
damage. In contrast, hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses, which can cause
chronic liver infection, are spread through the exchange of blood or bodily
fluids.
A dozen cases [of hepatitis A] have occurred around Asheville, North
Carolina, where food handlers at 2 restaurants tested positive for the
virus. In Knoxville, Tennessee, at least 57 cases of hepatitis A have been
linked to a restaurant there. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention has sent 2 epidemiologists to investigate.

[This report suggests that the source of the outbreak may have been a
single supplier of raw vegetables to several restaurants located throughout
north and central Georgia. It remains to be established whether the
outbreaks in North Carolina and Tennessee can be linked in any way to this
supplier. The comment that 2 food handlers in North Carolina tested
positive for hepatitis A virus doesn't preclude their being part of the
outbreak as well, since they may have contracted infection from the same
vehicle as the restaurant patrons. If the supplier of suspect vegetables in
Georgia can be identified, it should be possible to determine whether there
is any linkage between the outbreaks of hepatitis A in the 3 states. -
