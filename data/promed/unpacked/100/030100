The Health Ministry will give mandatory vaccinations to 10,000 residents in
a town outside Kuala Lumpur to prevent the outbreak of Japanese
encephalitis (JE), a news report said Monday.
Health officials have been monitoring a rise in cases of JE. Twenty cases
have been reported in the past year, including seven deaths.
Some 10,000 people living and working in the vicinity of 16 pig farms in
the town of Shah Alam have been told to register for vaccinations in the
next two weeks or face legal action, said Izhar Kadarman, the head of the
municipal council's health department. "Those who refuse can be charged
under the Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Act," he was quoted
as saying in the Star newspaper. The penalty is a maximum fine of 2,000
ringgit (US$530).
Izhar said no cases of the disease had been reported in Shah Alam, 25 km
west of the capital, Kuala Lumpur. But the Health Ministry considers it a
high risk area due to the number of pig farms. Most cases of the disease
have been reported in the western state of Perak and in Sarawak state on
Borneo island.
