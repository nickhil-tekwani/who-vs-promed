Health authorities in Guinea announced that they had identified a case of Lassa hemorrhagic fever, a viral disease related to Ebola, in the south of the country, in a press release. [Although clinical signs and symptoms of Ebola and Lassa fever virus infections may be similar, these 2 viruses are not related. - Mod.TY]

The Lassa fever virus was detected in a 17-year-old patient "coming from the sub-prefecture of Kassadou," in the prefecture of Guéckédou (south), where the epidemic was declared, indicated the Ministry of Health in a press release published Friday evening [22 Apr 2022].

The patient is being treated in a care center in Guéckédou, in the Nzérékoré region, and "her condition is currently satisfactory", according to this press release.

The virus was identified on [20 Apr 2022] by a laboratory in Guéckédou and "a 2nd test carried out at the reference laboratory in Conakry confirmed the 1st result", specifies the text.

An investigation is underway in the villages concerned "to identify all contacts and their follow-up. For the moment, no other case has been notified."

Lassa hemorrhagic fever belongs to the same family as the Ebola and Marburg viruses but is much less rapid. [Lassa fever is in a different family from Ebola and Marburg viruses. - Mod.TY]

Lassa fever is transmitted through rodent excretions or direct contact with the blood, urine, stool, or other body fluids of a sick person. Once declared, this fever can cause bleeding in the most severe cases (about one in 5 cases).

The virus takes its name from the town of Lassa in the north of the country, where it was first identified in 1969.

[This is the 1st report of a Lassa fever virus infection in Guinea this year (2022). Lassa fever cases have occurred before in Guinea, last year (2021), and in previous years, although sporadically.

West Africa, including Guinea, is endemic for the Lassa fever virus.

The follow-up contact tracing for this case by the Ministry of Health is prudent indeed. Orientation of the population where these cases occurred is an important preventive measure. Assuming that these cases acquired the virus from a rodent host, keeping the household environment free of rodents is a prudent practice.
