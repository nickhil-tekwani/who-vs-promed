Farmers in Tarlac [province, central Luzon] are worried that they may not get good harvests this coming 2nd crop season due to the disease that is attacking their rice fields. So far, rice fields in [Tarlac] town's 7 barangays [council areas] are already infected by the disease.

A [rice] grower said that he noticed brown discoloration on his rice plants a week after irrigation. "The stems are turning brown from a luscious green. The sheaths or the flowering top likewise turned brown, chaffy and covered with white to light pink fungal growth," said the farmer who cultivates [rice] on 10 hectares [of] land. He said the rice plants are at their flowering stage and in less than a month will be harvested.

[Other] farmers [also have] rice fields being infected by such conditions, [and] said that [they] noticed discoloration in [their] rice fields.

Provincial agriculturist Rowena Tabamo ordered samples of the soil and the affected palay [rice]. She said that they will send the samples to a laboratory and in a week's time, will get the results. [She also] learned that the varieties used by the farmers were not approved as of yet by the Department of Agriculture [but] are still in the testing period and not being encouraged to plant in large quantity.

[A range of pathogens, including fungi, bacteria, viruses and nematodes, have been reported previously to affect rice crops in the region. The symptoms described above are not sufficient for diagnosis, but reliable diagnosis of the cause and/or pathogen(s) associated with the problems is essential before any management strategies can be designed.
