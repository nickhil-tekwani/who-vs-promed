A strain of the deadly bird flu virus has appeared at a market in Western
(sic), although officials rushed to assure the public there was no health
risk to humans. It was identified as being in the same family as the virus
that caused a fatal outbreak [in humans in 1997 and led to the slaughter
of 1.6 million chickens, but authorities said it was a different version
that had never been known to cross to humans.
The virus found, Goose 96-type H5N1, generally occurred in ducks and geese
but could cross to chickens and infect them, potentially fatally,
authorities said.
The 1997 bird flu outbreak, which killed 6 people, involved Chicken 97-type
H5N1 virus, which is known to cause disease and death in humans.
Over the past year, authorities have conducted 28 000 tests and found 17
samples of the goose version of the virus in geese and ducks in wholesale
markets, but no examples of the dangerous chicken version. The latest goose
version-infected faecal sample, taken on 22 Feb 2001, was the first
discovery of a H5N1 family virus in a retail market since the fatal
outbreak in 1997, authorities said.
No examples of the chicken version of the virus have been found since new
control measures were instituted 3 years ago. Assistant director of the
Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department Dr Leslie Sims said the
market had been steam-cleaned and no further signs of the virus found.
Unsuccessful efforts had been made to trace the source of the virus, he
said. There was nothing to prevent the chicken or chickens that produced
the infected faeces being sold because this was routine testing and the
results did not come back until 4 weeks after the test was taken, he said.
He refused to speculate on the seriousness of an outbreak of the goose
version of the flu among chickens in Hong Kong, saying that existing
systems would prevent such an incident. But he admitted little was known
about how infectious the goose version of the disease was among chickens.
No sign of illness had been noted among poultry workers at the stall where
the fecal sample was found, said the assistant director of the Food and
Environmental Hygiene Department, Gloria Tam Lai-fan. "From the public
health point of view, we need not panic," she said, adding that stall
operators should ensure their stalls were kept clean. The public should
also avoid direct contact with bird droppings and wash their hands
thoroughly after handling live poultry, she said.
