Two people have died as a result of rabies virus infection in the
Povorensk and Podgorensk districts of the Voronezhska Oblast. Neither
sought medical attention for 3 days after being bitten, when it was
too late for successful treatment. During the past 8 months of 2008,
cases of animal bites increased 2-fold in comparison with the
previous year (4599 in 2007 compared with 7982 in 2008).

Physicians emphasize that people experiencing bites by dogs or other
animals should go immediately to the Voronezh Antirabies Centre.
Death is unavoidable if there is delay.

recorded in 2007 and 2008 but not the relative number of human rabies deaths.
