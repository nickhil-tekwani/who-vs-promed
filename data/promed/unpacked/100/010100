Is it known exactly how the patients travelled (i.e. by train, plane etc.)?

[The mode of travel is irrelevant because:
(a) Legionellosis is not transmitted person-to-person, and
(b) the travel connection is with countries outside Denmark, principally
tourist spots in the Mediterranean, where hotels have a record of harboring
_Legionella_ in their water systems.
However, it's a curious fact that the median age of the cases in travellers
was given as 49 (could that be a typo?), well below the median of 60 for
all cases; perhaps they were business travellers rather than tourists? -
