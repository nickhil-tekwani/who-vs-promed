Concerns over increasing reports of _Neospora_ outbreaks in cattle have been highlighted at the meeting of the National Access Forum for Wales held in Welshpool on Tuesday [3 Jul 2018]. _Neospora_ does not harm dogs, but dogs can carry the disease, which often goes undetected. The disease does, however, cause harm to cattle and sheep, and it can result in the abortion of unborn young.

NFU Cymru Rural Affairs Board chairman, Hedd Pugh, said: "In recent months, NFU Cymru has received increasing reports of outbreaks of _Neospora_ in cattle. These are coming from all areas in Wales. The disease is found in dog faeces, which can contaminate the animals' grazing pasture. That is why it's important that dog owners always pick up after their dogs."

Dogs owners are also encouraged to keep their dogs away from animal food and water troughs, as the disease can also be spread that way. Pugh added: "The impacts of _Neospora_ can result in significant costs and distress for farmers. We hope, through highlighting this disease and its impacts to the 40 or so organisations represented on the National Access Forum, we can raise awareness of this issue to access user groups and promote the 'bag it and bin it' message to dog owners." NFU Cymru has signs to remind dog owners to keep their dogs on a lead around livestock and to pick up after their dog.

[_Neospora caninum_ is a protozoan parasite of animals. Since its 1st recognition in dogs in 1984 and the description of the new genus and species _N. caninum_ (Apicomplexa: Eimeriina: Sarcocystidae) in 1988, neosporosis has been detected in various species of livestock, including cattle, sheep, goats, horses and deer. Neosporosis is one of the most frequently diagnosed causes of abortion in dairy cattle worldwide. Furthermore, _N. caninum_ infections in dairy cows may also be associated with premature culling and decreased milk production.

In general, _N. caninum_ is similar in structure and life cycle to _Toxoplasma gondii_, with 2 important differences: (i) neosporosis is primarily a disease of cattle; dogs and related canids are the definitive hosts of _N. caninum_, whereas (ii) toxoplasmosis is primarily a disease of humans, sheep and goats; felids are the only definitive hosts of _T. gondii_.

Although antibodies to _N. caninum_ have been reported in human serum, the parasite itself has not been detected in human tissues. Thus, the zoonotic potential is uncertain.

Several approaches have been used to control neosporosis in cattle herds. These include improving farm biosecurity, test and cull programs, test and exclude from breeding, and artificially inseminating with beef semen. Biosecurity may prove beneficial to avoid introducing the parasite into a closed herd not already infected with _Neospora_.

Farm management practices to reduce _N. caninum_ infection can include:
(i) minimizing fecal contamination of cattle feed or water by canids;
(ii) prompt removal of aborted bovine fetuses and fetal membranes; and
(iii) limiting the introduction of infected cattle into the herd and culling infected animals.

If using the test and cull method of control, every animal must be serologically tested, and those that test positive must be removed from the herd. Test-negative animals should be periodically retested because titers tend to wax and wane, and there is a possibility of horizontal transmission resulting in new infections. This approach can be devastating depending on how many in the herd test positive. Notwithstanding the risk of horizontal transmission, a more economic approach would be to test each animal and exclude the daughters of seropositive cows from the replacement pool. If a cow is valuable, there is always the opportunity to preserve the genetics by embryo transfer into a seronegative dam.

It is possible to reduce the risk of _Neospora_ abortions in dairy cattle by inseminating seropositive dams with beef breed semen. This is effective because crossbreed pregnancies have a more robust placentation with higher levels of peripartum pregnancy-associated glycoprotein, which may have a protective value. Beef breeds in general and the Limousin breed in particular are more resistant to _Neospora_ infection than are dairy breeds. Beef cow-calf herds that manage their cows on range for summer grazing have lower seroprevalence than those that do not, while increased seroprevalence is associated with higher winter stocking density.

These control methods might not be economically or practically feasible on dairies or beef cattle operations. Buying replacements originating from seronegative herds can mitigate the risk of introducing infected replacements into a negative herd. General management efforts to reduce stress from concurrent disease, environmental and social stress, and providing an adequate wholesome ration may reduce immunosuppression and hence abortion rates.

There is accumulating evidence that some cows infected with _N. caninum_ can develop a degree of protective immunity against abortion and/or congenital transmission, indicating that immunoprophylaxis to prevent abortion or congenital transmission is a feasible goal. A commercial vaccine is not currently available. In the future, vaccine development is likely to depend on identification of specific _Neospora_ genes that may enable the production of genetically engineered vaccines.

The above information on control/prevention of _N. caninum_ is derived from the (2015) review by C. T. Estill and C. M. Scully, which also includes updated information on the epidemiology, lifecycle, pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical signs of the disease; see at http://media.johnwiley.com.au/product_data/excerpt/34/11184708/1118470834-58.pdf. - Mod.AS
