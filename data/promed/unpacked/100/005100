An unimmunized horse in Escambia County was recently euthanized because it contracted the mosquito-borne eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

According to the Escambia County Department of Health, unimmunized horses throughout the county are at risk for this disease. Horse owners are encouraged to keep current all equine immunizations for mosquito-borne diseases.

To protect horses from the effects of this disease, vaccinations should be current and delivered on a frequency of 2 times each year, every 6 months, in consultation with a local veterinary professional. In horses, the clinical presentation of EEE includes: apprehension, depression, elevated temperature, head shaking, muscle twitching, incoordination, weakness of hind limbs, inability to stand, aimless wandering, head pressing, and listlessness.

EEE was first recognized in Escambia County, Florida in 1937.

While EEE rarely infects humans, transmission of the virus to humans is possible from the bite of an infected mosquito. Human signs and symptoms of EEE infection can include sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, and coma. Severe cases of EEE infection in humans can lead to brain damage or death. Persons experiencing symptoms of a mosquito-borne disease should seek immediate medical care.

Within the past 2 weeks, 2 horses -- 1 from Bladen County and 1 from Carteret County -- died after contracting eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) .

Animals can get the disease from an infected mosquito.

Both horses were unvaccinated; the Carteret County horse was euthanized on [21 Jul 2014] and the Bladen County horse died on [2 Aug 2014].

The 2 cases are the 1st reported cases of EEE in horses in North Carolina this year [2014].

"If your horses exhibit any signs of EEE, contact your veterinarian immediately," said State Veterinarian David Marshall in a written release. "Several serious contagious diseases, such as West Nile virus, equine herpesvirus, and rabies, have similar symptoms and should be ruled out."

Earlier this summer [2014], New Hanover County officials reported that the disease was found in a sentinel chicken flock. The state recorded 15 EEE cases in horses in 2013.

EEE causes inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord and is usually fatal. Symptoms include impaired vision, aimless wandering, head pressing, circling, inability to swallow, irregular staggering gait, paralysis, convulsions, and death.

Once a horse has been bitten by an infected mosquito, it may take 3 to 10 days for signs of the disease to appear.

The vaccinations initially require 2 shots, 30 days apart, for horses, mules, and donkeys that have no prior vaccination history. Marshall recommends a booster shot every 6 months.

[How very sad that these animals had to die from a horrible disease, a disease preventable by vaccination.

West Nile virus, EEE, and Western equine encephalitis come in a combination vaccine. Protecting your horse is easy. Vaccinate the animal.

Spray the horses with equine fly and mosquito repellant, and clean up breading grounds for mosquitoes. And be diligent to vaccinate your horse. - Mod.TG]
