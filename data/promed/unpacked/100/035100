Plague is occurring in Uganda, killing 10 out of 121 infected people
in Arua, and 9 out of 39 in Nebbi, according to the Ministry of Health.

The disease broke out in Logiri and Vurra sub-counties of Arua. In
Nebbi, the affected area was Nyapea. No new cases have been reported
in either area in the past week, partly because of massive indoor
residual spraying against fleas.

The Minister of Primary Health, Dr Emmanuel Otaala, said women were
most affected due to the local custom that women sleep on the ground.
They are only allowed in bed when the husband invites them for sex,
he explained.
