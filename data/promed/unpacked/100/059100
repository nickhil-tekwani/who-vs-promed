Confirmation that a Novel SARS-associated Coronavirus is the Cause of SARS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENEVA: Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that a new
pathogen, a member of the coronavirus family [the family _Coronaviridae_]
never before seen in humans, is the cause of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS). The speed at which this virus was identified is the result
of the close international collaboration of 13 laboratories from 10
countries. While many lines of evidence have found strong associations
between this virus and the disease over the last weeks, final confirmation
came today. "The pace of SARS research has been astounding,"said Dr. David
Heymann, Executive Director, WHO Communicable Diseases programmes. "Because
of an extraordinary collaboration among laboratories from countries around
the world, we now know with certainty what causes SARS. The successful
identification of the coronavirus means that scientists can now confidently
turn to other SARS challenges. For example, various laboratories continue
to work to unravel the genetic information of the SARS virus and compare
the sequences obtained from viruses in different parts of the world.
Experts are gathering at WHO this week to map future work on SARS."
"Today, the collaboration continues as top laboratory researchers have come
to WHO to design the next steps, a strategy for transforming these basic
research discoveries into diagnostic tools which will help us to
successfully control this disease," said Heymann. "Now we can move away
from methods like isolation and quarantines and move aggressively towards
modern intervention strategies including specific treatments and eventually
vaccination. With the establishment of the causative agent, we are a
crucial step closer." This collaboration has brought together leading
scientific expertise, and was established after WHO issued a global alert
on SARS on 12 March 2003. The priority has been to find the cause and to
develop diagnostic tests. Two laboratories in China recently joined this
network of laboratories from Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of China, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, the
United Kingdom, and the United States of America.
"Today, the first part of the mission of our network has been fulfilled, as
researchers have both detected a hitherto unknown virus and established it
as the cause of SARS. The new coronavirus has been named by WHO and member
laboratories as SARS virus, "said Dr Albert Osterhaus, the Director of
Virology at Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam. The Erasmus Medical Centre
completed the work to definitely prove that the new coronavirus causes SARS
[see following report].
Over the past three weeks, due to the urgency surrounding the worldwide
threat to health of SARS and early indications this was a new member of the
family _Coronaviridae_, research has proceeded under the assumption that
SARS was caused by a new coronavirus. The 13 laboratories have been working
on meeting Koch's postulates, necessary to prove disease causation. These
postulates stipulate that to be the causal agent, a pathogen must meet four
conditions: it must be found in all cases of the disease, it must be
isolated from the host and grown in pure culture, it must reproduce the
original disease when introduced into a susceptible host, and it must be
found in the experimental host so infected. Credit for the coronavirus
findings, which definitively pinpoints the cause of SARS, is attributed to
the 13 laboratories, working in conjunction with WHO.
"The people in this network have put aside profit and prestige to work
together to find the cause of this new disease and to find way new ways of
fighting it,"said Dr Klaus St√∂hr, WHO virologist and the coordinator of the
collaborative research network. "In this globalized world, such
collaboration is the only way forward in tackling emerging diseases."
WHO and the network of laboratories dedicate their detection and
characterization of the SARS virus to Dr Carlo Urbani, the WHO scientist
who first alerted the world to the existence of SARS in Hanoi, Vietnam, and
who died from the disease in Bangkok on 29 March 2003.

Scientific Confirmation that a Novel Coronavirus is the Etiologic Agent of SARS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization said tests prove severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) is a [novel] coronavirus,. These latest tests were carried
out by scientists at the Erasmus Medical Centre, University of Rotterdam,
the Netherlands. This laboratory is one of 13 laboratories from 10
countries working with the WHO to combat the virus. The scientists infected
monkeys with the strain of coronavirus suspected of causing SARS. They
found that the animals developed the same symptoms of the disease as
humans. The test was a crucial step in verifying the cause of the disease.
Although experts have thought that a new [species] of coronavirus was the
main cause of SARS, it had remained unclear whether infection with a second
[unrelated] type of virus, Human metapneumovirus, makes the illness worse.
Their tests were made possible by studies published last week, which
suggested SARS was a new virus [see: SARS - worldwide (48): etiology
20030414.0909, and the following report]. Scientists from eight countries,
including Germany and the United States, found it was not consistent with
any other known virus. They also carried out genetic tests on the virus,
which found it was "only distantly related" to known coronaviruses.
Dr David Heymann, executive director of WHO communicable diseases
programmes, hailed scientists' efforts to identify the virus. "The pace of
SARS research has been astounding," he said. "Because of an extraordinary
collaboration among laboratories from countries around the world, we now
know with certainty what causes SARS." Dr Heymann said the discovery would
now enable scientists to concentrate on developing diagnoses kits and
treatments. "Now we can move away from methods like isolation and
quarantines and move aggressively towards modern intervention strategies
including specific treatments and eventually vaccination. "With the
establishment of the causative agent, we are a crucial step closer," he
said. The discovery will also help scientists trace the evolution of SARS
and could help them determine whether it jumped from animals to humans.
Tests are ongoing in pigs and poultry to see how susceptible those animals
are to [the SARS coronavirus].
Researchers at the University of Hong Kong said a new genetic sequencing of
the SARS virus proves conclusively that it came from animals. [This
conflicts with the interpretation of the British Columbia Cancer Centre
scientists, who have obtained the the complete sequence of the SARS virus
genome: see below. - Mod.CP]. Malik Peiris, a microbiologist at the
university, described SARS as "something that is new to science". He also
dismissed claims that it could have been spread by terrorists. "That whole
genome is essentially new," he said. "Nature has been the terrorist
throwing up this virus."
On Tuesday, a German biotechnology company said it was distributing a new
high-speed test for SARS. Their test identifies this strain of the
coronavirus which has now been confirmed as causing SARS. The firm Artus is
confident the test can confirm the presence of the lethal respiratory
disease in two hours, whereas traditional tests for antibodies take more
than 10 days [see also: SARS - worldwide (46): diagnostic test 20030413.0901].

SARS Coronavirus Genome Has 11 Novel Open Reading Frames
--------------------------------------------------------
NEW YORK: The sequenced coronavirus believed to cause Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has 11 open reading frames (ORF), and these
predicted coding regions lack homology to sequence in existing gene
databases, Steven Jones, Director of Bioinformatics at the British Columbia
Cancer Center, said today. "People were thinking that [the SARS virus] was
some kind of hybrid virus between a fairly well studied human virus,
recombined with a non-human virus," he said. "A lot of those Asian flus
have been associated with avian viruses." But the ORFs that Jones' group is
finding all have consistent phylogeny. "They all look like they have been
in the same organism for a long period of time," he said. And they are
"only modestly similar to [ORFs in] other coronaviruses."
Jones led an all-night effort last Friday night to assemble the sequence of
this viral pathogen, after the raw reads began coming off of the center's
ten ABI 3700s and 3730 sequencers at 9:30 PM. "We were continuously doing
assemblies through the night as more and more virus accrued," he said. As a
result, the small team beat the US Centers for Disease Control to the
finish line for the draft sequence (although nobody says there was a race).
The process began six days earlier, when the group received a microgram
sample of virus from the Canadian National Microbiology lab in Winnipeg,
Manitoba --- a small sample to work with. They spent the first four days
making the cDNA library out of the RNA virus, Jones said. "On Thursday we
were able to pick enough colonies to start doing DNA prep on the clones,
and by Friday virtually the entire genome's worth of sequence was loaded
up. "There were no real bumps in the road once the sequencing machines got
going. The shotgun sequencing was at a 20-30-fold level of redundancy,
Jones said, "because we didn't want to do any iterative finishing steps."
The only problem with sequencing this deep was that the group began finding
single-base mutations in different copies of the viral genome. Though
mutations in the virus are of potential research interest, Jones said the
level of mutation found was not unsurprising given the rapid rate at which
viruses mutate, and the fact that the group had grown the virus in primate
cells to produce more sample. Still, they have to further analyse the
sequence for mutation sites. Now Jones' team is redesigning PCR primers to
confirm the sequence, and is doing further sequence analysis, including
comparing its draft to that released yesterday by the US Centers for
DiseaseControl, Jones said.
The BC Cancer Center team is also in touch with the Canadian Centers for
Disease Control, which is involved in efforts to establish reliable tests
for SARS, along with the US CDC and other bodies around the world.
Separately, the Singapore News reported Tuesday that the Genome Institute
of Singapore has also sequenced the SARS coronavirus, and has prepared a
test kit for SARS which it plans to make available to local laboratories
and hospitals this week.

WHO Update 30 - Status of Diagnostic Test
-----------------------------------------
Scientists participating in the WHO collaborative network of laboratories
have developed several diagnostic tests for SARS. These include a so-called
"PCR" test, which allows detection of the distinctive genetic information
of a virus. Primers, which are the key pieces for a PCR test, were made
publicly available by network laboratories on the open WHO web site
(<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/primers/en/>) on 4 Apr 2003. The primers have
since been used by numerous countries around the world.
WHO scientists are now increasingly optimistic that the current PCR
diagnostic test for SARS can rapidly be fine-tuned to a stage ready for
roll out. Fine-tuning is needed because of important limitations in the
ability of the current test to rule out the presence of
[non-SARS-associated] coronavirus in SARS cases. Yesterday, the
Bernhard-Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany informed
WHO that primers developed there are being made available, in the form of a
ready-to-use kit, by a Hamburg-based biotechnology firm. Apart from ease of
use, the test kit has the advantage of built-in quality control. WHO was
further informed by the Hamburg Institute that the test will be offered at
no cost to laboratories participating in the WHO collaborative network [see
also: SARS - worldwide (46): diagnostic test 20030413.0901].
Initial testing of the kit by network members is expected to quickly yield
the data needed to assess the test's performance, in comparison with
primers developed by other WHO network laboratories. The ability to detect
persons infected with the SARS virus at an early stage is a key measure of
performance. WHO has been concerned that weaknesses in earlier experimental
tests for SARS would allow too many virus carriers to slip past undetected.
Existing PCR tests are very specific but may not detect all patients who
are excreting coronavirus. Early and reliable detection of the SARS virus
in samples will be of great assistance in helping health care staff
determine which persons presenting with fever and other suspicion-arousing
symptoms should be immediately isolated and managed according to strict
procedures of infection control. Such procedures will, in turn, greatly
reduce the likelihood that infection will spread to others.
