On 17 May 2006, a dead black-tailed jack rabbit (_Lepus
californicus_), was collected from a site east of the Rick Husband
International Airport in Amarillo, Texas. The animal was one of over
20 that had died recently along an approximately 0.6-mile portion of
non-public road, as noted by the USDA/APHIS-Wildlife Service District
Supervisor based in Canyon, TX.
The hare was submitted to the CDC Bacterial Zooonses Branch by the
Texas Department of State Health Services Zoonosis Control
Veterinarian.
On 18 May, a positive FA [fluorescent antibody test] for tularemia
was reported by the CDC. Since then, ticks from a coyote found
approximately 1 mile NW of the die-off have also been reported as
positive for tularemia.
The airport's terminal and parking garage were areas of concern due
to an extremely high lagomorph population interfacing with a high
amount of human activity.
The City of Amarillo, Bi-City-County Health District's Environmental
Health and Department of Public Health, in concert with Amarillo
Animal Control, the Department of State Health Services Zoonosis
Control Group and USDA/Aphis-Wildlife Services initiated a
three-pronged approach to reduce public health risk.
A health alert regarding tularemia was issued to all area medical
facilities; a press conference was held advising the public of the
presence of the disease and precautions to take to prevent human
infection; and a population-reduction program was begun on the
terminal grounds with insecticides applied in that area as well as in
the die-off zone.
A week after the program was launched, the lagomorph population has
been significantly reduced based on observation and no human cases of
Tularemia have been reported. At this time, the affected area has
expanded slightly to the east into the secure runway areas, based on
reports of dead jackrabbits by Wildlife Services personnel.
Monitoring of the area and sample collection continues. An alert was
also issued region-wide and information on rabbit/hare or rodent
die-offs is being solicited.

[_Francisella tularensis_, a gram-negative pleomorphic bacterium, is
the causative agent of tularemia. This infectious disease was first
described in Japan in 1837. The name of the disease is related to
1911 description of a plague-like illness in ground squirrels in
Tulare County, California, and work done by Dr. Edward Francis. Dr.
Francis described his personal experience with more than 800 cases in
1928. The causative agent is found in more than 100 species of wild
animals, including birds and insects, worldwide. The most virulent of
the 4 known strains is found in primarily in North America. The
strains appear to vary in both virulence and geographical range.
The route of transmission and factors relating to the host and the
organism influence the presentation. The organism produces an acute
febrile illness in humans. - Mod.TG]
