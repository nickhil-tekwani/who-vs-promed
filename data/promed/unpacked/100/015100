[1] Iran (Kerman, Sistan-Baluchistan): H1N1 cases

An outbreak of swine flu has left 33 people dead in 2 provinces of southeastern Iran in the past 3 weeks, the official IRNA news agency reported on Mon [7 Dec 2015].

IRNA quoted Deputy Health Minister Ali Akbar Sayyari as saying there had been 28 deaths in Kerman province and 5 in Sistan-Baluchistan and warning that the H1N1 virus was likely to spread to other areas including the capital Tehran. "The health ministry predicts that the virus will spread in the coming days to Tehran, West and East Azerbaijan and Kermanshah provinces more than to other places," he said.

Nearly 600 people have been hospitalised in Kerman province over the outbreak, the head of the province's medical university, Ali Akbar Haghdoost, told the ISNA news agency. "Traces of the H1N1 virus were uncovered 3 weeks ago, and we were the 1st province to report the epidemic," Haghdoost said.

He called for limited travel during a 3-day holiday weekend due to start on Thu [10 Dec 2015] in order to prevent the spread of the virus. Haghdoost suggested the outbreak was now under control. "We have received 5000 doses of vaccines today [7 Dec 2015], and a shipment of 15 000 will arrive tomorrow," he said.

Health Minister Hassan Hashemi said on Sun [6 Dec 2015] the number of deaths from flu was similar to previous years but that it was evolving and becoming harder to treat. "This flu comes from beyond our borders, especially from Sistan-Baluchistan, near Pakistan," Hashemi said, quoted by the Youth Journalist Club (YJC) state television website. "But every year, it becomes wilder and more resistant to treatment," he added. YJC only referred to the illness as the flu and made no mention of swine flu.

Patients suffering from diabetes; cardiovascular, kidney and lung diseases; and cancer; as well as the elderly, children under 5 and pregnant women are more sensitive to the virus and must be vaccinated, said Sayyari.

A senior official from the Health Ministry's Infectious Disease Department on Monday [7 Dec 2015] reported the state of swine flu to parliament's hygiene and treatment committee, IRNA reported.

A major H1N1 outbreak in 2009 sparked a World Health Organization pandemic alert in June 2009, after the virus emerged from Mexico and the United States. The alert was lifted in August 2010, and the outbreak left some 18 500 people dead in 214 countries. The 1st instance of swine flu in Iran was reported in June 2009 when a 16-year-old Iranian boy entered the country with his family on a flight from the United States.

[These cases are most likely influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (pH1N1). This virus caused a flu pandemic in 2009-2010, which claimed several hundred lives. The influenza virus leads to respiratory disease that results in a variety of symptoms in humans, including nasal secretion, barking cough and a decreased appetite. Seasonal reassortment and re-emergence of the virus leads to severe and untreatable infections, causing the generation of drug-resistant strains and antigenic shift, which can influence viral entry into cells, transmission and tissue tropism. Several drugs and vaccines developed in order to combat the virus are currently undergoing clinical trials. Of these, only a few antiviral drugs, such as zanamivir and oseltamivir, have been reported to help prevent the effects of "swine flu."

A total of 90 percent of influenza-related deaths occur in older adult populations, indicating that viral disregulation of the immune system becomes more severe with age, owing to immunosenescence [Reber AJ, Chirkova T, Kim JH et al. Immunosenescence and challenges of vaccination against influenza in the aging population. Aging Dis.3(1),68-90 (2012)]. Influenza virus infection leads to symptoms such as fever, body pain, sore throat, loss of appetite, headache, cough, aching muscles and joints, weakness, fatigue, pneumatoceles [cysts in the lungs], mediastinal emphysema and secondary renal failure leading to fatality in extreme cases.

Pigs are the most important reservoir for influenza A viruses, acting as an intermediary host for both interspecies transmission and genetic reassortment.

Excerpted from Saxena SK, Kotikalapudi R, Tiwari S . 2012. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Virus: Therapeutics and Challenges. Future Virology. 7(10):947-950 (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/773528).

Pigs may act as "mixing vessels," facilitating the reassortment of influenza genes from different viruses and creating a genetically new influenza virus. These new reassortant viruses may be more easily spread from person to person or may cause more severe disease in humans than the original viruses. - Mod.LK]

[On 6 Dec 2015, ProMED-mail reported a serious influenza outbreak in the Swabi district of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa, Pakistan, with 8 of 13 cases identified as H1N1 (Influenza - Pakistan: (KP) (H1N1)pdm09 20151206.3843544). This current report provides positive confirmation of H1N1 pdm09 as the etiologic agent in 10 cases. It is not clear whether this includes 3 new cases in addition to the 7 previously reported in Swabi or 7 new cases out of 10 submitted in that location.

Although the elderly can experience more severe symptoms, it was reported that there was no age preference in these cases. - Mod.LK
