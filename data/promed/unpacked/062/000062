In a follow-up to the report of an outbreak of flea-borne typhus in downtown Los Angeles [see ProMED-mail post Murine typhus - USA (04): (CA) homeless; Archive Number: 20181006.6075346], the Pasadena Public Health Department (PPHD) is reporting epidemic levels of typhus fever this year [2018].

In 2018, 20 Pasadena residents have been confirmed to have typhus fever, well above the expected 1-5 cases per year.

"Typhus fever is a disease that can cause serious complications requiring lengthy hospitalization, and, rarely, death," said Dr. Ying-Ying Goh, Pasadena Health Officer. "All residents should take steps to prevent fleas in and around the home."

Flea-borne typhus, also known as murine or endemic typhus, is a disease carried by fleas infected with bacteria (_Rickettsia typhi_ or _Rickettsia felis_). Flea-borne typhus is found regularly in Los Angeles County, especially Pasadena, with most cases occurring in the summer and fall months.

Locally, the primary animals known to carry infected fleas include feral cats and opossums. People with significant exposure to these animals are at risk of acquiring flea-borne typhus. Pet dogs and cats that are allowed outside are more likely to come in contact with infected fleas and could spread the disease to humans. Although pets and animals do not get sick from typhus, the disease can cause high fever, chills, headache, and rash in people. Typhus can be treated with antibiotics.

There are simple precautions to prevent the spread of typhus fever disease:

- Maintain the yard free of debris, and trim overgrown vegetation to prevent harborage of wild animals like feral cats and opossums.
- Do not leave pet food outdoors.
- Do not provide food or water for wild animals.
- Keep garbage containers tightly covered.
- Seal all openings and crawl spaces under the home.
- Routinely treat pet dogs and cats with flea control medication.

[Pasadena, with an estimated population of 142 059 residents in 2016, is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States, located 10 miles (16 km) northeast of downtown Los Angeles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena,_California). The city hosts the annual Rose Bowl football game, the Tournament of Roses Parade, and the Norton Simon Museum. A map showing the location of Pasadena can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pasadena,+CA.

The murine typhus outbreak in nearby downtown Los Angeles has been reported mainly to involve homeless people, as recently posted by ProMED-mail (Murine typhus - USA (04): (CA) homeless 20181006.6075346). However, the above news report fails to say whether the Pasadena outbreak is occurring in any particular segment of the population there or is related in any way to the downtown Los Angeles outbreak.

Although the total number of homeless individuals in Los Angeles County has been reported to have fallen from 55 048 in 2017, to 52 765 in 2018, the number of homeless is now much higher than the number in 2010 (35 926 homeless individuals in LA County, http://www.pasadenaindependent.com/news/san-gabriel-valley-homeless-population-grows-by-five-percent/). The homeless population in Pasadena in 2018 (677 people experiencing homelessness) is 18% more than in 2017 (575) and 28% more than in 2016 (530, http://pasadenapartnership.org/homeless-count-reports/).

The majority (77%) of the homeless population in Los Angeles County are unsheltered, 68 percent in Pasadena. Also, the homeless population is growing older; in Pasadena, the number of homeless individuals aged 50 and older increased by 65 percent (http://www.pasadenaindependent.com/news/san-gabriel-valley-homeless-population-grows-by-five-percent/).

More information on the murine typhus outbreaks in Los Angeles County (in the downtown area of the city of Los Angeles and in Pasadena) would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
