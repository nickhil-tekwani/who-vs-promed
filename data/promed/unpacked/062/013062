India: Source of Hepatitis E Outbreak in Mumbai Not Yet Identified
------------------------------------------------------------------
Winter is usually the time for viral infections, but this year there is a
worrying and unusual yellow tinge in the city's healthscape. Hepatitis E
virus infection -- with its visible trademark, jaundice -- is sweeping
across the city's southern peninsula, say doctors. What is even more
worrying is that public experts have not been able to locate the outbreak's
source. 93 people died of the disease in 2004 -- almost double the number
for 2003.
Hepatitis E usually spreads through contaminated water or foodstuff. So, as
soon as the incidence of hepatitis E increased increase, the Brihanmumbai
Municipal Corporation's (BMC) Public Health Department dashed off a letter
to the water supply department asking for a thorough check of the water
lines. But water samples being picked up by the BMC "on a daily basis" from
the so-called affected zone -- comprising the city's posh areas of Napean
Sea Road, Cuffe Parade, Walkeshwar and Churchgate, among others -- show no
contamination. "We have been using extra chlorine and can detect that in
our daily tests," says chief hydraulic engineer T V Shah. Some media
reports suggested that the BMC was replacing water pipes in south Mumbai
because of the jaundice scare. But Shah says, "We are replacing pipes in
areas such as Kamathipura, Bhuleshwar, Byculla and so on, areas that have
old pipes."
Hepatitis cases have not been reported from these areas, he says. South
Mumbai MP Milind Deora, who met BMC commissioner Johny Joseph on Wednesday
and discussed the jaundice outbreak, told the Times of India that it's
unlikely that the outbreak has arisen from contaminated water. "If
contaminated water was the reason, the whole of Mumbai would have been
affected," he says.

[Hepatitis E virus displays a strong tropism for hepatocytes, and it is
transmitted via the fecal-oral route. It is responsible for an acute
self-limited infection characterized as acute hepatic inflammation. It has
been claimed, however, that in endemic areas in India, hepatitis E virus
may be a common cause of acute liver failure. The earliest documented cases
of hepatitis E virus infection occurred in India (Delhi) in 1955 after
heavy flooding. Subsequently sporadic outbreaks have been recorded
throughout Asia, Africa, and Central America, usually in association with
contaminated drinking water. Pigs, rats, deer, and some other animals may
act as alternate hosts. Outbreaks of disease in Japan have been associated
with consumption of wild boar meat and undercooked meat from farmed swine.
No vaccine is available at present. - Mod.CP]
