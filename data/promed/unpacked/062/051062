I would like to add the following to the list of prior incidents of
widespread community disease resulting from "escape" of an agent from
a research laboratory.
The unintended release of Anthrax spores over a 50-60 kilometer area,
from a Soviet military microbiology research (Biopreparat) facility
in Sverdlovsk in the Ural Mountains in 1979 (now Yekaterinburg,
Russia), killed 66 of 77 human cases (85 percent case fatality) as
well as the majority of exposed livestock. The affected area covered
approximately 900 sq. km. I am surprised that Dr. Peters did not
include this incident considering his past experience at Ft. Detrick.

Although not a large-scale "community event," ProMED-mail might also
include the viral hemorrhagic fever cases which occurred
simultaneously, in 1967, in Germany (Marburg and Frankfurt) and what
was then Yugoslavia (Belgrade). What is now known as the Marburg
virus infected a total of 37 personnel (lab staff and some of the
people who had cared for them).

In reference to CJ Peters' post about possible fluA that escaped from
a lab, 1977 China was mentioned. Perhaps the author meant instead the
1977 USSR isolate (A/USSR/90/77 H1N1) that was the 1st H1N1
identified since 1958. Its HA is most closely related to A/Lepine/48.
Relatives of this strain subsequently became quite widespread.
By the single criterion of sequence stability/evolution, there are 2
other examples of which I am aware. One is A/Alma Ata/84. Its HA is
uniquely closely related to A/swine/Iowa/15/30 and A/swine/29/37. The
other is the pair of A/Mongolia/153/88 and A/Mongolia/111/91. The HA
of the pair is most closely related to A/NWS/33, A/WSN/33, A/Puerto
Rico/8/34, A/Cambridge/39.
Unlike A/USSR/90/77, there were no further isolates closely related
to these strains. This fact suggests that, if they were "escapees,"
they were localized in time and area. However, in light of the
seriousness of the discussion about lab-escaped pathogens, it is
important to note that there are alternate, null hypotheses that
should be considered 1st. One type of null hypotheses is that lab mix
ups, or cross-contamination, resulted in the sequencing of an old
strain instead of a newly isolated strain (or, conceivably, the
submission of the incorrect sequence!).
A second type of null hypothesis is that the strains were
vaccine-derived revertants. The Mongolia isolates were likely derived
from a vaccine (A/Puerto Rico/8/34 x A/USSR/90/77) in use in the
Mongolian population at the time (Anchlan et al. 1996 Arch Virol
141:1553). Live vaccine-derived virulent strains are (unfortunately)
not unfamiliar to virologists (e.g., poliovirus, porcine reproductive
and respiratory syndrome virus [e.g., Opriessnig et al. 2002 J Virol
76:11837]). I would like to learn from those who are familiar with
A/USSR/90/77, to see if perhaps it too might have been the result of
a failed vaccine.

I would like to comment on the email posted by CJ Peters on this
subject. I believe that CJ's comments are timely and important to the
present debate on handling viruses and their containment levels. His
comments are also relevant to the concerns the USA has about
bioterrorism. Of particular concern, following 3 laboratory accidents
with the SARS coronavirus, is the fact that there is international
pressure to raise the biocontainment level of the SARS coronavirus to
BSL-4.
Having been involved in the investigation of 2 of the 3 laboratory
incidents, I feel that it would be useful for me to make some
comments on their causes. As yet, we have no clear idea of the cause
of the incident in Beijing. The Singapore incident is clearly
documented on the Singapore Ministry of Health web-site
,
and the cause was not that the virus was handled at BSL-3. The main
causes were, firstly, that the laboratory did not handle West Nile
virus in the same way as SARS-CoV in the same BSL-3 laboratory.
Secondly, there was little training of staff, and, finally, the
laboratory procedures were not consistent with BSL-3 procedures, and
significant breaches occurred when the accident took place.
In Taiwan, the accident occurred in a BSL-4 laboratory. Before
opening a Class III biological Safety Cabinet (a special transport
cabinet), the principal investigator "inactivated" a spill using 70
percent ethanol instead of the time-consuming procedure recommended
(hydrogen peroxide). In this case, the principal investigator was
working alone at BSL-4. He worked excessive hours, and methods were
not approved. There is also a major problem with a lack of
understanding of chemical disinfection. Many scientific staff think
that 70 percent ethanol is a good disinfectant (it isn't - I wouldn't
recommend its use except for bench decontamination in a relatively
clean laboratory, and, certainly, not in a biological safety
cabinet). It would be my conclusion that the failures were
institutional rather than due to the individuals involved. (We need
to take care about attributing blame, or incidents will not be
reported).
A major problem in all of these incidents has been the poor training
of staff, and, improper operating procedures, rather than with
accidents associated with containment. There would appear to be no
justification for moving SARS-CoV to BSL-4, but, rather, a need for
laboratory accreditation and proper training of staff. In virtually
all of the laboratories we looked at, there was little understanding
of infection control and how to handle laboratory spills. This
becomes of greater concern as molecular biologists move into these
laboratories with little microbiology training.
There have been large numbers of laboratory accidents, and these are
well-documented in the BMBL. However, I agree with CJ, except for the
Beijing SARS-CoV incident, that there appears to be little evidence
for transmission in the community from infected staff. If my memory
serves me correctly, most of the infections (VEE, Rift Valley fever,
brucellosis) are dead-end in the human hosts. This is not the case
for SARS-CoV.
The UK smallpox incident mentioned was not related to transmission
from laboratory staff to another person. I understand that it was
related to the operation of the air handling systems within the
facility in Birmingham, with the air being sucked in from the
laboratory to the floor above. Most of the foot-and-mouth disease
incidents have not been associated with laboratory escapes but are
related to the inadequate inactivation of the virus with formalin,
which has a tailing off in its inactivation curve. One has only to
think of the same problem with inactivated polio virus ("Cutter"
incident).
The problem of containment of aerosols, and their re-entrainment into
buildings, is one of the reasons why BSL-3 laboratories operate under
negative air pressure, and, also, why their air exhaust needs to be
HEPA-filtered. It is of concern to me that some countries do not have
proper standards for the operation of BSL-3 laboratories, and, that
they do not require HEPA filtration of the air exhaust. They rely on
the containment provided by the HEPA filters in biological safety
cabinets. An accident outside the cabinet would not be contained.
Furthermore, many BSL-3 laboratories are not sufficiently air tight,
and fumigation is a potential hazard to people outside of the
laboratory. I know of a number of incidents of gassing with
formaldehyde, but, fortunately, with no fatalities (yet).
Laboratories need to be constructed so that they meet a
pressure-decay standard, rather than require an ongoing search for
leaks when under negative pressure.
Another concern I would like to raise is the rapid development of new
BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities around the world. There are insufficient
experienced construction groups to build these facilities, and,
trained staff to work in them. Furthermore, the high cost of running
and maintaining them does not seem to be taken into account. If these
issues are not addressed, these laboratories could become future
biohazards.
In conclusion, we need to be careful not to over react and classify
organisms at too high a biosafety level. If SARS-CoV went to BSL-4, I
don't believe that it would make things safer, but it would make it
very difficult to work on it in the region where it occurred.
Furthermore, it is time that we reviewed our biocontainment and
biosafety standards. Laboratory staff, from the laboratory directors
on down, need to take responsibility for the biosafety within their
facilities and ensure that staff are properly trained and that their
facilities meet present containment requirements. Having looked at
many facilities around the world over the past few years, I'm
concerned that further accidents will occur unless these issues are
addressed.

4 comments for your consideration for inclusion in ProMED-mail
concerning the note by Dr. Clarence Peters ("Laboratory safety &
disease dissemination: RFI") and the ensuing discussion contained in
ProMED Digest V2004 #210:
1) The editor's comment regarding the lab-acquired smallpox incident
in the UK in 1978 does not match the accounts I have seen,
particularly an article from the 5 Sep 2002 London Review of Books
<http://www.lrb.co.uk/v24/n17/penn01_.html>,
which describes the incident and reports smallpox infections in both
Ms. Parker (fatal) and her mother (who recovered). Thus, it appears
that there was secondary transmission.
2) The premise of the exchange is unsupported. It began with Dr.
Peters' assertion that "We are about to see an onslaught of
uninformed persons weighing in on the importance of laboratories in
disseminating diseases to surrounding communities." Peters implies
that infectious disease researchers must prepare to defend themselves
against ignorant criticism from outside of their professions. There
is no discussion, or validation, of this assertion. No basis is
provided for it, nor is there any indication of what motives these
alleged "uninformed persons" may have. Who are they, and why are they
allegedly preparing to do this? Does Dr. Peters count WHO among them,
which has warned that laboratories pose risks for new SARS outbreaks?
Accounting for laboratory accidents is a valuable exercise. But, the
premise of this discussion is unsound and needs more adequate
explanation.
3) The Council for Responsible Genetics (Cambridge, MA), which may
be an "uninformed person" in Dr. Peters' view, recently published a
list, albeit incomplete, titled "Mistakes Happen: Accidents and
Security Breaches at Biocontainment Laboratories," which may be
downloaded here:
<http://www.gene-watch.org/bubiodefense/pages/accidents.html>
4) Dr. Peters' inquiry brings to light a failing of regulatory
systems. Taking the United States as an example, were it the case
that comprehensive reporting requirements existed for laboratory
accidents, then data would be readily available on the subject of
this RFI. Unfortunately, no such requirements exist and, therefore,
information must be culled from ProMED-mail subscribers, who may or
may not be aware of accidents, and whose information about them,
perhaps anecdotal, may or may not be accurate (see comment #1). The
necessity of this exchange, in order to learn of accidents, and the
inherent unreliability of such a "straw poll," demonstrates the need
for publicly-accessible comprehensive accident reporting requirements
in the US and in other countries.
