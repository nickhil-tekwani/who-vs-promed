At least 12 blue bulls (nilgai) kept at Tanda Dam Wildlife Park in Kohat have died of anthrax infection while many more are infected, an official of the wildlife department told The Express Tribune on Tuesday [18 Mar 2014]. He said there are around 35 blue bulls in the park. A team of doctors visited the site to investigate the cause of the mysterious deaths and confirmed that it was an anthrax attack.

The infection is caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_ and mostly affects domesticated mammals or farm animals that inhale the spores of the bacteria through grazing. [No, they ingest the spores.] The disease is lethal and can spread to humans and other animals if the spores are in any way transported.

The official said they had been asked by the doctors to stay away from the animals since it can be transmitted to humans and there is little hope of treatment. [Carcasses are not contagious, and treatment of cutaneous lesions is usually 100 percent successful.] He added this was the 2nd attack of its kind in the region. In early 2006, an anthrax infection claimed the lives of at least a dozen animals.

"The problem is the location of the park as every Sunday thousands of people visit this area because it is a famous picnic spot," he explained, suggesting there should be a complete ban on people visiting the park to avoid spreading of the infection.

No high ranking wildlife official was available for comments. An official of the livestock department, however, told The Express Tribune the infection was highly fatal and could claim more lives. "When the last epidemic was recorded in the same park, we recommended a biannual vaccination against the disease which we prepared in our labs at nominal charges, but no one paid heed to it," he said, adding a team of veterinary doctors visited the park but are yet to submit a report. "Until this is over, I will recommend that the park should be completely shut down for general public and as we cannot rule out a second anthrax attack. Every possible precautionary measure should be adopted," he added.

[Tand Dam is a small dam located in Kohat District, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. It is north of Peshawar. This seems to be a weekend picnic site for people living in Peshawar. We know from the experience of park officials in Africa that tourists will poke around dead carcasses and if they get blood on their hands, cutaneous cases will certainly follow. From the errors in this report, based presumably on official releases and interviews with available wildlife officials, there is a lack of experience and knowledge. Reports to OIE are more accidental than purposeful.

From colleagues working in the country I am informed that livestock anthrax is common in northwestern Pakistan (Kurram Agency, North Waziristan, Frontier Region Kohat, and Orakzai Agency in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Kohat district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, previously called North-West Frontier Province). As to their 2006 outbreak, latterly reports to Paris of any outbreaks started in 2007, and as "+" or disease present.

The nilgai (_Boselaphus tragocamelus_), sometimes called nilgau, is the largest Asian antelope. It is one of the most commonly seen wild animals of central and northern India, often seen in farmland or scrub forest. The mature male appears ox-like and is also known as the blue bull. A blue bull is called a nil gai or nilgai in India, from nil meaning blue and gai meaning a bovine animal (literally 'cow'). It is also present in parts of southern Nepal and eastern Pakistan. The species has become extinct in Bangladesh. The US state of Texas is home to more nilgai antelope than their native country of India.

The fact that they are reporting cases only in bulls is probably because of their behaviour -- in anthrax with grazing/browsing animals the disease is seen more often in males -- in this case probably because they are an easier visible target for biting flies which are attracted to "black bodies", that is, the whole body mass and shadow, and CO2 emission. These bulls would be hard to miss (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilgai, http://www.nsrl.ttu.edu/tmot1/bosetrag.htm, and http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/415415/nilgai.
