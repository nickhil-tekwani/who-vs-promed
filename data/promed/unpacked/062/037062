Measles outbreak in the Barcelona Region of
Catalonia, Spain, Oct 2006 to Feb 2007
----------------------------------------------------------------------
From 1 Oct 2006 to 31 Jan 2007, 213 confirmed
cases of measles occurred in the Barcelona
Region, resulting from the importation of one
case. The imported case was a six-year-old girl
of Eastern European origin. She presented on 26
Sep 2006 with a fever of 38 �C, mild rash and
enanthema (mucosal rash). Although the source of
her infection could not be laboratory-confirmed,
she had attended a family gathering in Italy with
her mother, where, according to very limited
available information, other guests may also have
had measles. The girl�s mother also had
measles-like symptoms during their stay in Italy.
The girl had never been vaccinated against
measles, and when the serology results were found
to be positive for IgM antibodies against measles
virus, the public health authorities were
immediately notified of the case. Due to the
difficulty to contact the girl�s family, who live
in a caravan, measures to hold back the spread of
the disease could not be implemented. In
addition, it was impossible to gather more
information on the epidemiological background and
to implement active surveillance for more cases.
Three close relatives of the first case also
consulted medical services at the end of
September with developing rash, but refused any
confirmation procedures. They were cousins,
living in Barcelona and two other towns at a
short distance from Barcelona, and had gathered
at a funeral in the last week of September. One
of the three cousins had beginning coryza symptoms at the funeral.
Around that time, a second case was notified and
confirmed. This was a 10-month-old unvaccinated
girl with rash onset on 10 Oct 2006. Although she
stayed in the same neighbourhood as the index
case, contact between them could not be
established. Subsequently, more cases began to
occur in indigenous children (born in Spain) and
later on, by 5 Nov 2006, more relatives of the
index case living in another town in the northern
Barcelona Region became ill. They could be
contacted and confirmed as measles cases [The
dates of measles rash onset are plotted in the
form of a histogram in the original text].
The link between these cases in the Eastern
European family and their cousins and the first
indigenous cases was only possible through
genotyping of the virus. The five cases related
to the index family were infected with the same
measles virus genotype as 10 cases belonging to
three clusters of indigenous cases, genotype D4.
Case definition
---------------
A confirmed case of measles was defined either as
a case that was laboratory confirmed (by
detection of IgM type antibodies against measles
virus, positive PCR, or culture from urine), or
as a case that met the clinical case definition
and was epidemiologically linked to a laboratory
confirmed case, as detailed in [1].
The epidemic curve for the outbreak from Sep 2006
to the end of Jan 2007, with the number of
confirmed measles cases by week of onset is shown
in Figure 1 in the original text. The age
distribution of confirmed cases is displayed in a
second figure in the original text. The median
age of confirmed cases is 14 months (range two
months to 50 years). The two-month-old child as
well as their mother were both laboratory-confirmed cases.
From Oct 2006 to Feb 2007 there were 213 cases
of measles (laboratory-confirmed or
epidemiological linked to a laboratory-confirmed
case) with 41 hospital admissions. Seventy are
still under investigation and 42 have been
discharged from hospital. The outbreak is still
ongoing. To date, only 15 urine samples have been
genotyped and classified as D4, coinciding with
the genotype circulating in Italy during the
summer of 2006 [2]. This genotype has been
imported during the last two to three years from
Romanian immigrants, but circulation of
indigenous measles virus has been interrupted
since 2000 [3]. Transmission of the virus has
been identified in pre-school facilities,
hospitals and family settings. ourteen of the
total 213 confirmed cases had received either one
or wo doses of MMR vaccine, according to their
age. These cases will be studied thoroughly once
the results of urine genotyping are available.
Outbreak control actions taken
------------------------------
In response to a suspected measles case, active
surveillance was set up. Susceptible contacts
from six months of age were vaccinated with a
first dose of MMR, or a second dose, if they had
previously received only one dose. Contacts not
eligible for vaccination (women) were given non-specific immunoglobulin,
and vaccination was recommended after five to six months.
All children aged nine to 15 months living in the
Barcelona Region will be immunized until the
outbreak ceases. A second dose will be
administered, when the nine- to 12-month-old
babies reach 15 months of age, and those aged 12
to 15 months receiving the vaccine will be
considered as prime immunized. Parents have been
alerted by means of individualized letters
advising them to contact their vaccination center
as soon as possible in order to immunize their
child with MMR vaccine. As a result, 16 634
infants were vaccinated at 228 vaccination
centres throughout the Barcelona Region between
11 and 30 Jan 2007, which corresponds to 56% of
the population in the age group from nine to 15
months. In addition, MMR vaccination was
recommended to all susceptible health care staff.
Discussion
----------
As a result of the Measles Elimination Programme
implemented in Catalonia in 1991, the incidence
of measles infections fell to less than 1/100 000
inhabitants. The last indigenous case reported in
Catalonia was registered in 2000. Since then, the
region has been free of measles with the
exception of a few cases due to importation and
mainly in the unvaccinated adult population [3,4].
In 1981, the combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR)
vaccine at age 15 months was added to the
vaccination schedule of Catalonia, and by 1988, a
second dose of the MMR vaccine for boys and girls
(up to then only girls received a second dose for
rubella immunization at 11 to 12 years) was added
to the list of routine vaccinations. Since 1999,
the second dose of MMR is administered to
children when they are 4 years old. These changes
in vaccination strategy resulted in a great
decline in the number of reported measles cases [5].
During the last five years, the incidence was
less than 1/100 000, and all cases have been
imported or secondary to importation [6].
According to the latest sero-epidemiological
study carried out in 2002, the overall prevalence
of anti-measles antibodies in Catalonia was 98%
(95% CI, 98-99%), almost equal to that obtained
in the 1996 study [99% (95% CI, 98-99 %) [7].
Coverage for MMR in 2005 was 99% for the first
dose and 92% for the second dose in Catalonia,
and 97% for first dose and 92% for second dose in
the rest of Spain [8]. Outbreaks have occurred in
recent years, the most important being in Almeria
(2003) with 186 cases and in Madrid (2006) with
177 cases, both after the importation of a case
from abroad and affecting mainly unvaccinated
adult population. As in an outbreak in La Rioja
in 2005-2006 [9], the proportion of cases we
observed in children younger than 15 months is
noteworthy, given that this is below the
recommended age in Catalonia for the first dose
of MMR. This will be followed up in detail.
In the past two years, several large outbreaks in
Romania and the Ukraine were the source of
measles outbreaks in a number of EU countries
that had already achieved high levels of measles
control (Estonia, Germany, Lithuania, Portugal,
Poland, Italy and Spain) [10]. Therefore, in
order to reach the goal set by the World Health
Organisation to eliminate measles from the
European Region by the year 2010 [11],
strengthened surveillance and high vaccination
coverage need to be maintained in countries with
low incidence to keep virus spread restricted to
isolated susceptible groups. Furthermore, great
efforts need to be made to reduce the incidence,
especially in those European countries with low vaccination coverage [12].
