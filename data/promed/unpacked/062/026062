Travellers heading to Botswana or those who find themselves in Limpopo need to ensure they take the correct preventative measures as a warning have been issued for high levels of malaria in both of these regions.

The Ministry of Health and Wellness for Botswana has issued a warning that the country is experiencing high levels of malaria, following the recent heavy rains. "There have been increases in the number of cases in Okavango, Ngami, Chobe, Boteti, Tutume and Bobirwa. Travel agents are advised to warn their clients to seek medical advice 2 weeks before travelling to malarial areas."

The Limpopo Health Department [South Africa] has also announced an increase in the number or reported malaria cases in the province, particularly around Lephalale and Thabazimbi [both in Limpopo District, South Africa].

News24 reports the Limpopo health department on [Tue 14 Mar 2017] confirmed at least 46 cases of malaria had been reported in the western Waterberg district around Lephalale and Thabazimbi. The department's spokesperson Thabiso Teffo stated no fatalities had been reported. "It is an area that does not normally have malaria mosquitoes. We also worried that 70 percent of the cases reported were people who had not travelled. It means they had contracted malaria in the area they stay." Teffo said the department started spraying insecticide and informed residents and doctors.

However it is important to note that the department says it is "not an outbreak. It's malaria season". The concern is that the cases are uncommon because it's an area where we don't expect malaria.
