Thailand: probable person-to-person transmission of avian influenza A
(H5N1) virus
-----------------------------------------------
[The following is the Abstract of a paper published today [Mon 24 Jan 2004]
in the New England Journal of Medicine, authored by Kumnuan Ungchusak and
15 others. It is reproduced here, as it provides an authoritative account
of the single probable case of person-to-person transmission of avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus during the course of the outbreak of avian
influenza in Thailand in 2004 and in Thailand and Viet Nam subsequently. -
Mod.CP]
Background
--------
During 2004, a highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus caused
poultry disease in 8 Asian countries and infected at least 44 persons,
killing 32; most of these persons had close contact with poultry. No
evidence of efficient person-to-person transmission has yet been reported.
We investigated possible person-to-person transmission in a family cluster
of the disease in Thailand.
Methods
--------
For each of the 3 involved patients, we reviewed the circumstances and
timing of exposures to poultry and to other ill persons. Field teams
isolated and treated the surviving patient, instituted active surveillance
for disease and prophylaxis among exposed contacts, and culled the
remaining poultry surrounding the affected village. Specimens from family
members were tested by viral culture, microneutralization serologic
analysis, immunohistochemical assay,
reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, and
genetic sequencing.
Results
--------
The index patient became ill 3 to 4 days after her last exposure to dying
household chickens. Her mother came from a distant city to care for her in
the hospital, had no recognized exposure to poultry, and died from
pneumonia after providing 16 to 18 hours of unprotected nursing care. The
aunt also provided unprotected nursing care; she had fever 5 days after the
mother first had fever, followed by pneumonia 7 days later. Autopsy tissue
from the mother and nasopharyngeal and throat swabs from the aunt were
positive for influenza A (H5N1) by RT-PCR. No additional chains of
transmission were identified, and sequencing of the viral genes identified
no change in the receptor-binding site of the hemagglutinin or other key
features of the virus. The sequences of all 8 viral gene segments clustered
closely with other H5N1 sequences from recent avian isolates in Thailand.
Conclusions
--------
Disease in the mother and aunt probably resulted from person-to-person
transmission of this lethal avian influenza virus during unprotected
exposure to the critically ill index patient.
