In March 2012, a patient with a history of prior hospitalisation in Serbia was diagnosed in France with acute pyelonephritis due to New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Case report
-----------
In February 2012, a woman in her early 60s was referred to the Infectious Diseases Department of the Military Hospital Begin (Saint-Mande, France) for an acute pyelonephritis. She reported having undergone a surgical intervention in Serbia in November 2011. She stayed a month in hospital, with urinary catheterization of undetermined duration but less than a month. The medical records reported a 1st treatment with cefuroxime and streptomycin just after surgery, and a history of fever, drowsiness and inflammatory syndrome 2 weeks after surgery, treated with ceftriaxone and streptomycin. Laboratory data were unavailable.

Since her return to France, in early February 2012, she complained of urinary frequency, dysuria and urinary incontinence. In late February, she presented to her general practitioner (GP) with fever (38.7 degrees C; 101.66 F), vomiting, diarrhea and diffuse abdominal pain and she was referred to our hospital. White blood cell count was 4470/mm3 (norm: 4000-10 000/mm3), C-reactive protein 52 mg/L (norm: less than 5 mg/L), creatinine 36 micromol/L (norm: 62-106 micromol/L).

The urine culture revealed _P. aeruginosa_ serotype 011 (HIABP11). The rectal swab, performed for multidrug resistant bacteria screening according to the French recommendations for patients with a history of hospitalisation abroad in the previous year [1], was also positive for _P. aeruginosa_. Blood cultures remained negative.

Kidney ultrasonography was normal, kidney CT-scan showed a left pyelonephritis without abscess or urinary obstruction. The patient underwent urinary catheterisation and 3 weeks antibiotic treatment with aztreonam (2g TID) and colistin (2 million units TID).

Antimicrobial sensitivity testing and molecular diagnostics: For the isolates from urine and rectal swabs, antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar (I2A Laboratories, Perols, France) and interpreted according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) recommendations [2]. It demonstrated resistance to imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, to all antipseudomonal cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, rifampin and tigecycline. Both isolates remained susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and intermediate to aztreonam. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of selected antimicrobials determined by microdilution and Etest (Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) confirmed the results and showed susceptibility to colistin. The metallo-betalactamase-production screening in the meropenem-dipicolinic acid combined disk test (Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemas (KPC) + metallo-beta-l actamase (MBL) Confirm ID Pack, Rosco Diagnostica, Taastrup, Denmark) and in E-test with imipenem alone or combined with EDTA (Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) was positive.

PCR for carbapenemases, including MBL blaIMP, blaVIM, blaNDM revealed that HIABP11 harboured blaNDM. Sequencing showed 100 percent homology with blaNDM-1. PCR for detection of other beta-lactamase genes, plasmid-borne quinolone resistance genes and methylases were negative.

Fever and abdominal pain resolved within 48 hours after administration of antibiotics while urinary incontinence persisted, requiring prolonged urinary catheterization. Urinalysis 72 hours after the beginning of antibiotic treatment was normal and did not show any bacteria growth. The patient was discharged from hospital 21 days after admission.

During the stay at our hospital, a squamous-cell carcinoma of the oropharynx had been discovered and the patient underwent a 1st chemotherapy course and was discharged from our hospital. One week later, she experienced dysuria and abdominal pain, without fever or flank pain. She was treated with ofloxacin (10 days) and prednisolone (7 days) by her GP. _P. aeruginosa_ with the same antibiotic susceptibility pattern as previously was isolated and PCR for blaNDM-1 was again positive. Kidney ultrasound was normal.

The patient received piperacillin-tazobactam (4g TID) for 3 weeks, and her 2nd chemotherapy course, without complication. The urinalysis after 72 hours of treatment was negative and the patient was discharged for at-home hospitalisation [sic].

During both hospitalizations, contact isolation precautions with dedicated health care personnel were implemented. All patients hospitalized in the same ward were screened weekly with a total of 111 rectal swabs performed in 52 patients and no transmission of NDM-1 producing _P. aeruginosa_ occurred.

Discussion and conclusion
-------------------------
Since the 1st description in 2008, of an NDM-1 carbapenemase in single isolates of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and _Escherichia coli_ [3], NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been reported worldwide, mostly in patients with an epidemiological link to India or Pakistan [4,5]. However, among 77 patients infected or colonised by NDM-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae reported in Europe from 2008 to 2010, 5 had been hospitalized previously in the Balkan region [6]. Clinical isolates of NDM-1-producing _A. baumanii_ are also increasingly reported in Europe [7] and importation of NDM-1 -producing _A. baumannii_ from Serbia has been reported in 2011 [8].

We report here the 1st case of infection due to NDM-1-producing _P. aeruginosa_ in France. To date, only 2 other cases of colonisation or infection by NDM-1-producing _P. aeruginosa_ have been reported worldwide, occurring in 2 patients hospitalized in Belgrade, Serbia. Both had undergone invasive surgical interventions and none of them had travelled outside Serbia. No epidemiological connection was evidenced between them [9, 10].

NDM-1 producing bacteria are undoubtedly challenging: firstly, they are usually multiresistant to antibiotics because blaNDM-1 encoding plasmids co-harbor multiple resistance determinants. _P. aeruginosa_ shows a high level of intrinsic resistance to antimicrobial agents. Its ability to acquire and combine different resistance determinants represents a major threat, compromising therapeutic options. The acquisition of MBL-carbapenemase (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase (VIM), imipenemase (IMP), Sao Paulo Metallo-beta-lactamase (SPM), Australia imipenemase (AIM), German imipenemase (GIM), Dutch IMipenemase (DIM), NDM, led to emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) P. aeruginosa. The case presented highlights the difficulties of therapeutic management, with only 3 antibiotics categorised as susceptible or intermediate (colistin, aztreonam, piperacillin-tazobactam). Due to the low MIC recommended for the inferior breakpoint for aztreonam by EUCAST, wild type _P. aeruginosa_ are reported as 'intermediate.' However MBL-carbapenemases do not hydrolyze the monobactam aztreonam and high dose therapy can be useful for patients infected with MBL-producing _P. aeruginosa_ [11,12].

Secondly, NDM-1 producers have a potential for spread through the transfer of the plasmid-borne blaNDM1 gene [5]. In _P. aeruginosa_, there is no complete documentation for plasmid-borne or chromosomal localization for blaNDM1 gene yet. However, many outbreaks including carbapenemase-producing _P. aeruginosa_ and spread of MDR _P. aeruginosa_ clones have been recently reported, underlining that cross-transmission plays a major role in the spread of MDR _P. aeruginosa_ in hospital settings [13, 14]. These considerations combined with the emerging character of our isolate in France are reason why all members of the medical and paramedical staff agreed to set up a dedicated team to care for the patient and a weekly screening of all contemporary patients on the same ward.

This strategy is recommended in France for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriae [1] without any mention of carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter or Pseudomonas. However, in this particular case of a 1st isolation of NDM-1 producing _P. aeruginosa_ in France, this strategy allowed us to assess the absence of cross-transmission for this isolate.

This observation highlights the emergence of NDM-1 not only in Enterobacteriaceae, but also in _P. aeruginosa_ in the Balkan area and France. In our view, NDM screening should be performed when a carbapenemase-producing Pseudomonadaceae clinical isolate is identified.
