Health authorities have warmed Geelong residents to avoid mosquito
bites after a dramatic increase in cases of Ross River fever [virus
infections]. There have been 15 cases of Ross River fever reported to
the health department in the Barwon south western region so far this
year [2011], the same number as was reported for the whole of last year [2010].

Ross River fever is a mosquito borne [virus] disease that can have
flu-like symptoms such as joint pain.

Barwon Health department of infectious diseases associate professor
Eugene Athan yesterday [14 Feb 2011] warned that Geelong residents
could expect more mosquito-borne viruses such as Ross River fever and
dengue fever. "We actually don't see much Ross River virus in
Victoria. It's fairly common in northern New South Wales and
Queensland. "So this is a genuine phenomenon and it's related to
heavy rains and an increased mosquito population.

[Victoria has had more than the usual amount of rainfall over recent
months. There have been no reports of dengue in Victoria or of
presence of the dengue virus mosquito vector, _Aedes aegypti_.
ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving any reports of dengue
cases or vectors in Victoria. The dengue outbreaks have been in north
Queensland, quite distant from Victoria state.
