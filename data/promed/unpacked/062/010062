Carrot growers battle crop disease
----------------------------------
Carrot growers in the UK are struggling with a difficult season,
following another summer of low light levels and unseasonably heavy
rainfall.

Martin Evans, chairman of the British Carrot Growers' Association,
said: "Most of us in England only have about 85 percent yields
because of the lack of sunshine in August [2008], and the wet
conditions have caused cavity spot too, but in Scotland the situation
is worse."

Some Scottish growers report not just cavity spot problems, but
sclerotinia. One trade observer estimated that some Scots growers
will lose 50 percent of the crop to sclerotinia, which affects the
top of the carrot if it is under water for too long.

The fact that an increasing number of agri-chemicals are no longer
available to growers in the fight against pests and disease is having
an impact.

Disease threat increase for veg
-------------------------------
With the continuing wet, warm and humid conditions, this season will
be a particularly high pressure year for a number of diseases in
brassicas, according to John McCulloch of specialist agronomist
County Crops. There are also concerns about controlling these
diseases adequately, but without increasing resistance risk.

Advising growers in the North West, McCulloch said that he has seen
more sclerotinia this year [2008] than ever before. "I have seen a
lot of it in the usual crops such as lettuce, celery, carrots, and
oilseed rape and also in some more unusual crops such as calabrese.

"These high levels can be put down to this year's [2008] terrible
weather and high rainfall, which have encouraged sclerotinia as well
as other wet weather diseases including ringspot (_Mycosphaerella
brassicola_), white blister (_Albugo candida_), and botrytis."

McCulloch advises his growers to adopt an appropriate fungicide
programme, but with fungicide resistance and crop safety being top of
the agenda.

[Sclerotinia
------------
The disease is caused by the fungus _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_. It
affects many different hosts causing varying symptoms. On carrot, it
causes severe root rot and also affects the leaves. The pathogen is
primarily soil-borne and can survive in soil as sclerotia. It is also
spread by infected plant material, mechanical means, and wind-borne
spores. Risk of crop infection depends on the previous disease
history of an area as well as weather conditions. Disease management
includes cultural practices and fungicide applications. For more
information see ProMED-mail post no. 20081008.3187.

Cavity spot
-----------
This is a disfiguring disease of carrots and related root crops and
is caused by species of soil fungi belonging to the genus _Pythium_.
It develops slowly and is favoured by cool soil temperatures. The
fungi can be dispersed by water and mechanical means. Control
measures include tolerant host varieties, cultural practices, and
crop rotation. Chemical control is not always reliable. For more
information see ProMED-mail post no. 20071026.3477.

Ringspot
--------
Ringspot disease on _Brassica_ crops is caused by the fungus
_Mycosphaerella brassicicola_. Symptom development is favoured by
warm, humid conditions. The pathogen is spread by splashing water,
mechanical means, and insects and overwinters in plant debris and
biennial seed crops. The disease is managed mainly by timely
fungicide applications. For more information see ProMED-mail post no.
20080923.2997.

White blister
-------------
This disease is caused by the fungus _Albugo candida_ and affects
most species of the brassica family. Disease management includes
phytosanitation, cultural practices, and fungicides. For more
information see previous ProMED-mail post no. 20080218.0661.

Botrytis
--------
Grey mould rots and blights caused by fungi in the genus _Botrytis_
affect a large number of vegetable, fruit, and other crops. Disease
development may occur on different parts of the host and is favoured
by cool, moist conditions and low air movement. The pathogen can
overwinter in dead plant tissue as sclerotia and is also spread by
mechanical means and water. Disease management includes
phytosanitation, cultural practices, and fungicide treatments. For
more information see links below.
