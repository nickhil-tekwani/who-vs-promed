Guadeloupe
---------
Since June 2005, the available dengue epidemiological surveillance data
reveal a steady increase in the number of cases reported each
week. Epidemic onset was identified as from the beginning of July, after
the daily epidemic threshold of suspected dengue cases had been passed for
2 consecutive weeks, as determined by the sentinel physician network.
In June, the most affected areas are those of southern Basse-Terre
(Basse-Terre, Saint-Claude, and Gourbeyre) as well as Saint-Martin
island. Between the 1 and 6 Aug 2005, a network of sentinel physicians
reported 158 suspected clinical cases and 142 cases that had been confirmed
by biological analysis. Geographical expansion of the epidemic is
ongoing. Cases of dengue have now been reported in areas of central
Basse-Terre, on Grande-Terre, and on Marie-Galante island.
Martinique
--------
The threshold for the seasonal recurrence of dengue has already receded in
an abnormally premature manner; the epidemic threshold, beginning since
mid-June, receded by mid-July 2005. Those areas most affected by this were
those centrally located (Fort de France, Lamentin, Saint-Joseph, and
Schoelcher), those south (Riviere Pilote, Marin, and Francois), and those
north (Trinite and Basse Pointe). Between the 1 Jun 2005 and 10 Aug 2005,
the sentinel physician network reported 242 suspected cases of dengue; of
those, 234 cases had been confirmed by biological analyses. Extrapolating
from the sentinel network data, it is estimated that 1200 persons had been
infected in Martinique since the beginning of the epidemic.
Management Measures
-----------
The administrative committees for the plan for surveillance notification
and management of dengue epidemics (Plan de surveillance, d'alerte et de
gestion des epidemies de dengue, or Psage-Dengue) has initiated, in
Guadeloupe and in Martinique, notification of the population by a radio and
audiovisual awareness campaign, as well as by targeted actions at the
community level. Mosquito eradication steps to combat _Aedes aegypti_ have
been reinforced, as well as the epidemiological surveillance system. The
principal hospitals of the 2 departments (Guadeloupe and Martinique) are
prepared for the eventual influx of ill persons.
Recommendations
-----------
To prevent infection, it is important to:
1) Protect oneself against mosquito bites (use of mosquito nets, wearing
long-sleeved shirts and pants, use of insect repellents and insecticides)
2) Avoid permitting mosquitoes to proliferate by regularly eliminating all
breeding grounds, which can be found inside and outside houses.

[2] Philippines (Misamis Occidental)

Dengue outbreak also hits Misamis Occidental
---------------------------------------------------
Following the example of Cebu, a state of calamity was also declared in
Misamis Occidental in connection with the alarming outbreak of dengue fever
in the province.
This was contained in a resolution unanimously approved by provincial
legislators Friday.
Board Member Morpheus Agot, who spearheaded the measure, expressed
confidence the Provincial Government would be in a financially better
position to respond to the situation because its calamity fund is now made
available for disposition.
Dengue fever cases have been noted throughout the province's 17 localities.
From June 2005 until the present, there are 349 known cases, 9 of which
led to death. Those afflicted were mostly children.
However, the hotspots are in the cities of Tangub, Ozamiz and Oroquieta
where the most incidences occurred.
Of the 9 deaths, 8 are children and one teenager. 6 of the dead are from
Tangub City.
Governor Loreto Ocampos has also ordered the acquisition of an additional
platelet separator for the provincial hospital to hasten the process of
preparing for platelet transfusion for those patients who need it.
Agot said 3500 pesos [USD 65] will be provided as death aid for those
families who lost their children to dengue fever.
Meanwhile, Agot criticized Health Secretary Francisco Duque for "his
adamant stand not to declare a state of national calamity" in the face of
the mushrooming dengue cases in the country.
He said such a declaration would put greater government attention into the
problem, and hence, ensure its faster resolution.

[Cebu, as reported in the earlier posting (see also: 20050727.2201), and
Misamis Occidental, in this report, have shown an unusual upsurge of dengue
cases, approaching the critical point of whether the health authorities
declare a state of calamity or not. The entire Philippines has encountered
a 40 percent increase in dengue cases so far this year compared to the same
period of 2004. Political involvement and public awareness are both
essential for preventing the seasonal epidemics from worsening. - Mod.RY]

Vietnam detected 5500 dengue fever patients in the southern Mekong Delta
over the past month, raising the total number so far this year to more than
15 500, including 17 fatalities [a tentative case fatality rate or CFR of
110 per 100 000].
Most of local sufferers are from the provinces of Soc Trang, Dong Thap, Hau
Giang, An Giang and Bac Lieu, whose weather is most favorable for the
development of mosquitoes -- the disease's transmitter, according to local
newspaper Saigon Liberation on Thursday.
Local health agencies forecast that the disease could break out in August
and September. They are encouraging residents to kill mosquitoes and their
larvae more actively.
Vietnam reported 73 300 cases of dengue fever infection, including 101
fatalities [a CFR of 138 per 100 000] last year [2004], up 108 percent and
74 percent against the previous year [2003], respectively.
