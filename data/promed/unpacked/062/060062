Statement from Dr. Richard Wilkes, State Veterinarian, Virginia
Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services:
Turkeys test positive for antibodies for mild form of avian influenza
during routine testing
----------
During routine testing of poultry flocks prior to slaughter, the
Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS)
determined late Fri 6 Jul 2007 that a turkey flock in Shenandoah
County tested suspicious for antibodies of low pathogenic avian
influenza (LPAI). Testing over the weekend by the USDA's National
Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa confirmed the
presence of avian influenza (AI) antibodies, which indicates possible
prior exposure to the AI H5 virus. So far, USDA testing has not
identified the actual virus that caused the birds to produce the antibodies.
NVSL is doing further testing to help identify the virus and
hopefully determine its source. VDACS, USDA and the poultry owner are
working cooperatively to minimize the possibility that the virus will
move beyond this farm.
It is important for Virginia consumers to realize that this is not a
public health concern. No affected birds entered or will enter the
food chain, and poultry products are safe to eat. This is not the
severe, highly-pathogenic strain that has caused widespread flock
destruction and some human cases in countries outside of the United
States. Rather, this is almost certainly one of the many milder
strains of avian flu that are common in poultry and that cause only
minor sickness or no noticeable symptoms in birds. VDACS will
continue to work with USDA and the poultry industry to take all
necessary steps to successfully address this situation and minimize
its impact on Virginia agriculture.
The affected flock contains 54 000 birds, which will be euthanized as
soon as possible as a precaution and will be composted on site. While
LPAI poses no risk to human health, federal and state policy is to
eradicate H5 and H7 subtypes because of their potential to change
into more serious types, which have a higher mortality rate among birds.
The turkeys did not show any signs of illness prior to testing, and
the presence of AI antibodies does not pose a health risk to humans
or other birds. The state, along with the poultry industry, is
closely monitoring all poultry operations within a 6-mile radius of
the affected farm.
The poultry industry in Virginia already maintains strict biosecurity
in all aspects of production, from hatchery to farm to processing
plant. It is now enhancing its biosecurity measures throughout
Virginia to avoid transmission of any potential virus to other farms.

We are in the US season for LPAI in commercial poultry and wild
birds. ProMED has some 73 postings back to 15 May 1997. Let us hope
that this continues at this low level of pathogenicity. - Mod.MHJ]
