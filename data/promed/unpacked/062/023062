Angola: 2 more Marburg hemorrhagic fever deaths reported
--------------------------------------------------------
2 more people have died in northern Angola, bringing the death toll from
Marburg virus infection to 237 people. Health officials continue to warn
area residents of the dangers of this disease, which is spread through
bodily fluids.
Unfortunately, many of the earlier victims may have infected family members
who cared for them during their illness or who may have had a part in their
burial ritual. Death normally occurs less than 10 days after the symptoms
1st appear.
While Angolan health officials are insisting that this outbreak is under
control, the World Health Organization is not as optimistic. On Sunday [17
Apr 2005], Angola's deputy health minister Jose Van Dunem said: "We already
have it under control." However, doctors from the WHO and Medecins san
Frontieres continue to work in the Uige region of the country, but are
still being met with resistance in some quarters. It is suspected that some
family members are hiding from doctors the fact that their loved ones are
ill and, in the process, are risking becoming infected themselves. They
know that most of the people who go to the hospital die from this disease
and are reluctant to send their loved ones to what they see as a death ward.
Angolans are having a particularly difficult time dealing with the effect
that this disease is having on the way that they conduct funerals.
Traditionally, family members wash the body of the deceased and kiss it
goodbye. They believe that a funeral must be conducted in such a way so as
to show respect and love for the deceased and to keep vengeful spirits
away. Doctors and other health care professionals are being asked to
respect these customs while at the same time doing what is necessary to
prevent further infections. Winning the people's trust can do a lot to stop
the spread of this disease.

Angola: suspected cases of Marburg fever in Malanje province test negative
---------------------------------------------------
3 tons of hospital material and a car were donated on Monday [18 Apr 2005]
to the main hospital here of the northern province of Malanje by the
National Commission of Emergency and Civil Protection, created within the
scope of the program to fight Marburg virus, which has already killed 237
people. Among the materials are medicines, gloves, boots, smocks, lixivium
and a pulverizer, offered by UNICEF, and a vehicle granted by the American
oil firm Chevron Texaco. The initiative aims to prevent the sickness in the
neighboring Provinces of Northern Uije, said the coordinator of the
mentioned commission, Eugenio Laborinho; he added that the gesture will be
extensive [extended?] to Zaire, Kwanza-Norte and Bengo.
The provincial director of health in Malanje, Francisco Chagas, said that
the results of 9 test samples of suspected cases of hemorrhagic fever sent
to Luanda were negative, but technicians are still on alert for the illness.

Angola: 11 deaths in one family
-------------------------------
As epidemiologist Sylvia Briand boots up to take samples from a prospective
victim of Marburg virus infection in a cramped Angolan slum, wailing family
and neighbors stand by in fear, grief and fascination. Identifying cases of
Marburg hemorrhagic fever is seen as key to controlling an outbreak that
has killed more than 230 people in this southern African country and which
the UN World Health Organization says is not yet contained.
"We have seen some cases where it has killed 11 people in one family,"
Briand said. "At the moment, they are so afraid of the disease they do not
see us as partners." The government has said the epidemic is under control,
with cases limited largely to the northern province of Uige or occurring
among travelers returning from the region. But Angola and its southern
African neighbors remain on alert, fearing the scenes in Uige could be
repeated elsewhere.
South African officials on Wednesday [20 Apr 2005] tested a sick passenger
who arrived in Johannesburg on a plane from Angola's capital Luanda,
although there was no immediate indication that the illness was Marburg
hemorrhagic fever. [It was later reported that the woman was suffering from
malaria; see following report. - Mod.CP] In Uige, a tower of black smoke
rises into the air above the town -- where lack of power and water and
heavily-potholed streets show the legacy of Angola's 27 year civil war --
as health workers in protective gear burn contaminated waste. Most Marburg
cases are reported only after death, by which time family and other
caregivers have often also contracted the virus through body fluids,
including saliva, blood and sweat.
If Briand's tests on the swabs taken from the 20 year old woman, who died
suddenly and whose body lies visible inside the one-room corrugated
iron-roofed hut, come back positive, her family and others in the crowd of
more than 50 gathered around the home may already have the disease.
The joint WHO-government database of people who have been in contact with
the disease is growing. Some 90 per cent of infected cases have died,
although in a province of half a million people, most families remain
untouched by the disease. Doctors say if the virus was airborne like some
other diseases such as influenza, the death toll would be much higher.
As the crowd presses close and relatives cry and wail, the suited figures
spray the door frame and door with bleach as they move slowly into the
house before taking a swab from the dead woman's mouth. "There was not much
blood, so it might not be Marburg," Briand said. "But she was very young
and died quickly, and we have had cases turn up positive that we thought
were negative."

South Africa: quarantined air passenger has malaria not Marburg fever
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A woman who fell ill on an aircraft from Angola on Tuesday [19 Apr 2005]
night, and who was feared to have Marburg fever, appears to have malaria,
the South African health department said on Wed 20 Apr 2005.
Department spokesperson Solly Mabotha said the woman, who originally comes
from Eritrea, would be held under observation in an isolation ward at the
Johannesburg Hospital for a "while longer". "Although we have done a
thorough screening of the patient, we want to play it safe, and that's why
we're holding her for a while longer," he said. Mabotha said the
Johannesburg Hospital is one of the facilities that have been chosen to
keep suspected Marburg victims in isolation.
The woman became ill on the flight from Luanda on Tuesday [19 Apr 2005]
night shortly before it was due to land, South African Airways spokesperson
Onkgopotse JJ Tabane said. She was handed over to the airport health
authorities, because it was feared she might be infected with Marburg
virus. As a precautionary measure, the aircraft was also placed under
quarantine. "The plane has been disinfected, and we will not be using it
until we get the go-ahead," Tabane said.
