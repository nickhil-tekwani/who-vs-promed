WHO: Ebola Response Roadmap Situation Report 24 Sep 2014 [data as at the end of 21 Sep 2014]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
--------
The total number of probable, confirmed and suspected cases (see Annex 1) in the current outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa was 6263, with 2917 deaths, as at the end of 21 Sep 2014. Countries affected are Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone.

Figure 1 shows the total number of confirmed and probable cases by country that have been reported in each epidemiological week between the start of 30 Dec 2013 (start of epidemiological week 1) and the end of 21 Sep 2014 (epidemiological week 38: 15-21 Sep 2014), and indicates a fall in the number of reported new cases compared with the previous 2 weeks. However, for reasons given below, this is unlikely to be an accurate reflection of the reality.

The epidemic of EVD in West Africa is still increasing.

Outline
-------
This is the 5th in a series of regular situation reports on the Ebola Response Roadmap. The report contains a review of the epidemiological situation based on official information reported by ministries of health, and an assessment of the response measured against the core Roadmap indicators where available.

The data contained in this report are based on the best information available. Substantial efforts are ongoing to improve the availability and accuracy of information about both the epidemiological situation and the implementation of the response.

Following the roadmap structure, country reports fall into 3 categories:

(1) those with widespread and intense transmission (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone);
(2) those with an initial case or cases, or with localized transmission (Nigeria, Senegal); and
(3), those countries that neighbour areas of active transmission (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Senegal).

An overview of the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where there is a separate, unrelated outbreak of EVD, is also provided (see Annex 2)... -- more

Spanish Missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo Dies of Deadly Virus in Madrid
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Spanish missionary who was flown home to Madrid from Sierra Leone after contracting the ebolavirus has died, according to hospital sources. According to the Spanish news agency Efe, Manuel Garcia Viejo died from the disease at the Carlos III hospital in Madrid. Viejo was a medical director of the Hospital Order of San Juan de Dios and was working in the western Sierra Leonean city of Lunsar when he caught the disease. He was flown to Madrid in an isolation chamber by military plane and received by doctors in fully protective biohazard suits. Viejo is the 2nd Spanish priest to die of the ebolavirus in the space of a month, after Miguel Pajares died after being flown back to Spain from Liberia.

[3] Quarantine

Liberia: medical chief quarantined; aide dies
---------------------------------------------
26 Sep 2014: (Front Page Africa Online) Liberia's Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has recorded an EVD death with the Special Assistant to the Chief Medical Officer falling prey to the deadly virus. Rev. Napoleon Braithwaite, a Special Assistant to the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Bernice Dahn, has become the latest to fall to the deadly ebolavirus. News of Rev. Braithwaite's demise broke on Thursday morning [25 Sep 2014] as the government of Liberia was preparing for a news conference at the Health Ministry to announce the outsourcing of Liberia's Ebola Fight to United Nations Agencies in Liberia. The venue was quickly changed and the entire Ministry ordered by Health Minister, Dr Walter Gwenigale to [be sprayed]. A Health Ministry spokesperson confirmed Thu [25 Sep 2014] that the deceased died from the deadly ebolavirus and family members who helped to put him in a car to take him to the hospital, said he had not been going to work for a week now. The relative said it was difficult not to hold and touch him because they had a special bond and they could not see him suffer and not help. According to one relative, they place themselves under quarantine for 21 days.

[4] Vaccine delivery dilemma

http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-vaccine-for-west-africa-still-in-canada-6-weeks-after-it-was-promised-1.2776627


WHO still figuring out where [and to whom] it will go and how it will get there
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The experimental EVD vaccine that Canada promised to ship to West Africa to help fight the epidemic 6 weeks ago has yet to be shipped to West Africa a, says Dr Gregory Taylor, the country's new chief public health officer. The 800-1000 doses of the vaccine, which was developed at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, are ready to be shipped at any time, Taylor said, but the WHO is still trying to figure out where exactly the vaccine should be shipped, how it will get there, including how to keep it refrigerated for the entire trip to West Africa, and who will be responsible for it when it arrives.

"We have such a small amount. Even with 1000 doses, the number of people with this disease is huge compared to that," Taylor said. "Where should you ship it? How should you ship it? It is a live, attenuated virus, so that means it has to be kept at a certain temperature throughout or it kills the virus and it's inactive. "You have to have a receiving facility that will receive the vaccine, and then you have to have confirmed consent [from the vaccinees] because this is experimental. So, all of those issues are challenging, and I think it does seem like a long time, I know that, but there's huge issues with this."

Vaccine must go to all health workers
-------------------------------------
Taylor said one of the conditions of Canada providing the vaccine is that it be made available to local as well as international health workers fighting the epidemic. [But see comment] "When we put this on the front lines, we're insisting that this be available to all health care workers," Taylor said. "There are other health care workers than just those flying in from developed countries, all the African countries have their own health care workers."

On Thursday [25 Sep 2014], Minister of International Development Christian Paradis announced that Canada would be providing CAD 30 million [USD 27 million] more to the global effort to fight EVD... -- more

[800 vials of the NewLink candidate vaccine are expected to yield at least 1500 doses, and the US-based firm is "working very hard to produce a few more thousand doses in the coming months," Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO assistant director-general said (http://www.trust.org/item/20140926133510-nuxzt/?source=fiOtherNews2).

MSF alone has 280 internationals on the ground in West Africa; adding to that all the other internationals would make over 1000, but even supposing half the vaccine can be used for them, how would they be selected among those? Those at highest risk -- determined how? Furthermore, the vaccine is a live one, and reversion and breakthroughs have been known to happen with other live vaccines. - Mod.JW]

China-aided Mobile Bio-Safety Level III laboratory arrived in Sierra Leone
---------------------------------------------------------------------
On 25 Sep 2014, a China-chartered airplane carrying a China-aided mobile bio-safety level III laboratory arrived at Lungi International Airport of Sierra Leone. Chinese Ambassador Zhao Yanbo, Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Dr Ebun Strasser-King, Deputy Minister of Health and Sanitation Mr Foday Sawi, Deputy Minister of Transport and Aviation Mr Ibrahim Mansaray and other senior Sierra Leonean officials attended the arrival ceremony held at the airport. Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC), and other media organizations covered the event.

Ambassador Zhao stated that Chinese President Xi Jinping is very much concerned about the EVD situation and cares for the friends in EVD-stricken countries. President Xi announced on 18 Sep 2014 during his visit to India that China will provide a further 200 million Yuan (USD 32.54 million) package of cash, food, and material aid to Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and neighbouring countries to help contain EVFD. Ambassador Zhao indicated that taking into consideration the Ebola situation in Sierra Leone and in response to the urgent need for labs in the country, China decided to provide a mobile bio-safety level III laboratory to Sierra Leone. China's laboratory will scale up the testing of EVD cases and help Sierra Leone control EVD at an earlier date.

Acting Foreign Minister Strasser-King ... said that the 3-day national lockdown from 19-21 Sep 2014 resulted in a large number of survivors waiting to be tested, and indicated that China's mobile laboratory will speed up the detection process to help Sierra Leone cut off the transmission chain of EVD... -- more

[6] Liberia: collateral deaths
24 Sep 2014 (CNN) [This is the harrowing story of a woman with convulsions due to high blood pressure being turned away from the hospital where she used to be treated because it was closed for fear of EVD, then turned away from another because they are now taking only suspected EVD cases. At the 3rd she was bleeding, having bitten her tongue, and was turned away as a suspected EVD case. She had to be taken back home, untreated for her convulsions, to die. This is a very sad situation. Deaths in homes do not all get medically certified, but in any case, evidently not all deaths are due to EVD. - Mod.JW]

26 Sep 2014 (Reuters): Deaths from infectious diseases like malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia are likely to soar in West African countries where a vast outbreak of Ebola has crushed health systems and killed nurses and doctors.

Specialists on deadly diseases say deaths from malaria alone, which even before the EVD crisis killed around 100 000 a year in the West Africa region as a whole, could increase 4-fold in EVD-hit countries as people miss out on life-saving treatments. Even at this point, said Professor Chris Whitty of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in London [UK], in countries facing the worst of the EVD outbreak, "many more people are dying of other things that are not EVD". As the epidemic continues, these so-called "collateral" deaths -- including from complications in childbirth and chronic conditions such as heart disease -- will rise as the clinics and health workers that would normally treat them are overwhelmed... -- more

[7] Survivors help out
Date: Thu 25 Sep 2014
Source: KTEP (NPR) [edited]
http://ktep.org/post/grieving-grateful-ebola-survivors-liberia-give-back


[A 21-year-old] EVD survivor is caring for an infant whose mother died of the disease. [A] 39-year-old former teacher can't stop smiling. "I have to smile," he says. "I'm the 1st survivor from Ebola for the case management center here." Former patients like him, who've recovered from the virus, lift the collective spirit at the Doctors Without Borders [MSF] EVD center in Liberia's northern town of Foya. He was admitted to the high-risk isolation unit, which is part of a cluster of large tents that make up the bulk of the center.

While health workers busy themselves caring for patients on one side -- with all the stress, hard work, death and sorrow that entails -- there's an oasis of joy and relief on the other side, where a few brick buildings stand to the right. That's where EVD survivors congregate. But their smiles may mask deep sorrow. "I'm very fine, even though I've lost 7 [family members]," says [the 39-year-old man]. He and other survivors gather together in their own little center, beyond the pop-up tents. Several are helping Doctors Without Borders [MSF], looking after orphaned children and performing other tasks.

That's the case of the 21-year-old woman. With a sleeping infant tied to her back, she tells NPR that the person she loved most -- her big sister who raised her as a child after their mother died -- has died of EVD.... Now she doesn't have anybody else to look up to as a mother. But she's finding a way to give back for her own survival, watching over the 15-month-old baby girl strapped to her back. She never met the infant's mother, who died of the virus. The baby's grandmother, she adds, was being cared for in the isolation unit. "That's the reason I'm still at the EVD treatment center, volunteering to take care of this baby," she tells NPR. "The grandmother tested positive, but the baby tested negative, so Doctors Without Borders was looking for somebody to volunteer to take care of the baby." ... -- more

[8] Mapping the EVD zone

Online volunteers map uncharted EVD zones to help save lives
------------------------------------------------------------
Citizens from all over the world are donating their time by going online to build maps for relief workers. Call it crowd-sourced cartography that can save lives. Roads or paths to remote villages through deep forest in West Africa, bridges, and river crossings, school buildings that can be used as temporary clinics, an open field for a helicopter landing -- all these are visible from satellite imagery and provide critical information for delivering aid. However, these details never made it onto official maps in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone -- countries too poor to worry about whether there are accurate Google Maps loaded onto smartphones.

So when the EVD epidemic erupted earlier this year [2014], Doctors Without Borders [MSF], the American Red Cross, and other groups on the ground found that unreliable maps made fighting the spread of the deadly virus much more difficult. They could not trace the likely vectors of transmission because they did not know the patterns of peoples' daily lives, and they could not plan effective aid delivery.

Enter the collaborative Ebola project by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT). OpenStreetMap is a project to create a free, open map of the world, built by volunteers through GPS surveying, aerial imagery, and public sources of geographic data. Taking that concept a step further, HOT connects the OpenStreetMap community with humanitarian players on the ground to fill in the gaps on maps for disaster and crisis zones. Around 1200 volunteers so far have logged onto HOT's website, clicked on a map quadrant and traced in the rich geographic details visible from satellites. A quick tutorial guides volunteers through the work, which is similar to using a software programme like Adobe Photoshop.
