The risk of COVID-19-related multisystem inflammatory system in children (MIS-C) was significantly lower among vaccinated versus unvaccinated Danish children after infection with the omicron variant rather than with previous strains, according to a research letter published yesterday [8 Jun 2022] in JAMA Pediatrics (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2793024).

A team led by Aarhus University researchers used Danish COVID-19 surveillance registries to prospectively study 0- to 17-year-old patients diagnosed as having MIS-C at all of the country's 18 Danish pediatric healthcare units from 1 Jan 2022 to 15 Mar 2022. They were infected from 1 Jan 2022 to 1 Feb 2022, when omicron made up 95% of variants in that country.

Of the 583 618 children and adolescents estimated to have had COVID-19, 267 086 were vaccinated. Among those with COVID, one vaccinated and 11 unvaccinated MIS-C patients were identified.

Amid omicron, the risk of MIS-C was 89% lower in vaccinated versus unvaccinated patients (risk ratio [RR], 0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.83). The risk was 88% lower in unvaccinated patients during omicron than during the delta wave (RR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.06-0.23) and 86% lower than during the wild-type virus wave (RR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.07-0.29). There was no difference in MIS-C signs and symptoms between omicron and previous variants.

The authors said the findings may be attributed to omicron's reduced ability to cause hyperinflammation, because it is less likely to trigger the immune system.

"The lower risk could also partly be explained by a reduced risk after reinfection, although only 6% of our included infected individuals had confirmed reinfection, and such a reduced risk after reinfection has not yet been reported," they wrote, acknowledging that the study was limited by the few MIS-C patients.

The lower risk of MIS-C after omicron reinfection in vaccinated patients may also be due to the high effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine, the researchers said. "This may be caused by vaccine-induced modulation of the immune system, rendering it less prone to cause hyperinflammation after SARS-CoV-2 infection," they wrote.

Discussion
----------
"We found the risk of MIS-C after SARS-CoV-2 infection during the omicron wave substantially lower compared with previous SARS-CoV-2 variants. This could be explained by a reduced ability of omicron to trigger hyperinflammation as it is phylogenetically different and associated with an increased immune escape (3). The lower risk could also partly be explained by a reduced risk after reinfection, although only 6% of our included infected individuals had confirmed reinfection, and such a reduced risk after reinfection has not yet been reported.

"The risk of MIS-C during the omicron wave was found to be significantly lower after breakthrough infection in vaccinated compared with unvaccinated children and adolescents. A high vaccine effectiveness against MIS-C has previously been found during the delta wave, primarily explained by a high effectiveness against the delta variant (1,4,5). The present study suggests a direct vaccine effectiveness against MIS-C after breakthrough infection. This may be caused by vaccine-induced modulation of the immune system rendering it less prone to cause hyperinflammation after SARS-CoV-2 infection." - Mod.LK]

[2] CIDRAP updates
[A] White House gears up for young children's COVID vaccination

Next week, 2 federal vaccine advisory committees will consider emergency approval and recommendations for 2 mRNA COVID vaccines for children under 5, and today [9 Jun 2022] White House officials detailed the rollout plans that include an initial distribution of 10 million doses.

On 14 and 15 Jun 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) will first consider emergency use for the Moderna vaccine when used as a primary series for children ages 6 through 17 years old. Then they will discuss amending emergency use authorizations for both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines for the primary series for children as young as 6 months old.

Pending recommended approval by VRBPAC and a green light from the FDA, advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will meet on 17 and 18 Jun 2022 to discuss whether to recommend the vaccines in the age-groups.

At a White House COVID-19 briefing today [9 Jun 2022], Ashish Jha, MD, the committee's coordinator, said the Biden administration is eagerly awaiting a careful review by the groups, but is well into the planning. Once the vaccines are cleared for the youngest children, the nation will reach a key milestone by extending protection with vaccines to almost every American. "We also know it is important to do this right," Jha said.

Dawn O'Connell, JD, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said the vaccine for young kids can be shipped after FDA authorization, but doses can't be given until the CDC makes its recommendations. She said preordering by states and other partners is underway for an initial 10 million doses, split evenly between Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech. She added that distribution will be broad and equitable, with 85% of Americans living within 5 miles of where vaccine will be available.

Federal officials said that, unlike for other age-groups, vaccination of the youngest children -- ages 6 months through ages 4 or 5 years -- will mainly take place at pediatrician offices, family medicine clinics, and pharmacies.

Jha said, pending FDA and CDC clearances, vaccination of young children would likely begin in earnest as soon as 21 Jun 2022.

Vivek Murthy, MD, the nation's surgeon general, said vaccination of young children will be a powerful tool to cut the disease burden in the youngest Americans. He said 730 000 kids under 5 have been hospitalized with the disease, with nearly 500 deaths reported in the age-group. He added that the government will launch an information campaign, including a superhero-themed toolkit, so parents have the information they need.

[There has been more resistance to vaccination of children than adults, even though it is clear children also get sick following infection. The following is from a report by Katherine J. Wu in The Atlantic (https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/06/under-5-vaccines-approval/661221/):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"For months, the number of Americans who opted for their initial doses has held at just above 250 million, or about 79% of the population. And those numbers are unlikely to budge: A recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that less than one-fifth of parents are eager to vaccinate their infants and toddlers right away, with the rest unsure about the shots or outright opposed. 'I'm usually a much more positive person, but I don't believe this is going to change much,' says Robin Cogan, a school nurse in New Jersey's Camden City School District.

"During the delays in rolling out COVID vaccines for infants and toddlers, doubts about the shots ballooned, and misinformation seeped into data gaps. Parents watched SARS-CoV-2 hopscotch through their families. Now nearly all other mitigation measures -- along with much of the fear and social incentives that nudged many adults to sign up for shots -- have vanished. 'Parents are feeling like, if my kids don't need to be vaccinated in order to go back to school, back to child care, then what's the point?' [Jessica] Calarco [a sociologist at Indiana University] said. The opening up of American society in advance of these vaccines sent a message: The youngest children don't need to be immunized for things to be all good.

"Infant-and-toddler vaccination is now manifesting as yet another symptom of the United States's hyper-individualistic approach to crisis containment. Wear a mask or don't; nab a shot or don't. Vaccinating the youngest kids will change many little lives. But with so many weights stacked against pediatric vaccination, America will struggle to eke out its biggest benefits for the population at large.

"The primary perk of getting a COVID vaccine is still simple. The shots 'help the body do its thing faster,' says Nathan Chomilo, a pediatrician and health-equity advocate in Minnesota: speeding the process of booting the bug, shortening symptoms, and keeping them from turning severe. Vaccinated kids are more spared the tolls of debilitating and deadly disease, such as long COVID, MIS-C, and more.

"Children can also easily contract the coronavirus and spread it around; 'if we're even halving the amount of kid-prompted transmission we're having, it's going to make a substantial difference in day-to-day life,' says Emily Martin, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Michigan. Vaccinated children would be less likely to infect parents, siblings, and grandparents, who would be less likely to be pulled out of work and risk losing income. Schools and daycares would be safer, and entire neighborhoods would be better buffered against future outbreaks.

"Such a rosy scenario won't play out everywhere. 'We're going to see a separation of communities,' Martin told me, exacerbating existing disparities. Uptake has lagged spectacularly in other age-groups: Only 60% of 12- to 17-year-olds, and 29% of 5- to 11-year-olds, have gotten their 1st duo of doses. 'It seems like the younger the kids are, the more hesitant parents have been,' says Lanre Falusi, a pediatrician at Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC.

"Which means that places that struggle to muster support for shots will also likely maintain the status quo of having teachers and parents constantly out sick, exposed to gobs of virus, or caring for ill children, many of them too young to mask or isolate. Spread, too, will further surge. 'The household is really where the activity is' when it comes to viral spread, Martin told me. To have the youngest kids 'stay our susceptible group will continue to drive infection into the rest of the family.'" - Mod.LK]

[B] FDA reviewing Novavax manufacturing

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/06/white-house-gears-young-kids-covid-vaccination


Earlier this week, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) overwhelmingly recommended that the FDA approve the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use in adults, but so far the agency hasn't made the final determination.

An FDA spokesperson told CNBC that the agency is reviewing changes to Novavax manufacturing before making its final decision. The manufacturing changes were submitted on 3 Jun 2022, just days before VRBPAC met.

Novavax's manufacturing partner is India's Serum Institute, and that's where doses would ship from, once the FDA authorizes it for emergency use. The decision to use the vaccine still awaits a recommendation from the CDC, which is considered after the FDA makes its final announcement.

[C] WHO releases SARS-CoV-2 origin review
Date: Thu 9 Jun 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/06/white-house-gears-young-kids-covid-vaccination


Last year [2021] the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a new group to analyze the origins of novel pathogens, and its 1st task was to examine evidence on the source of SARS-CoV-2. Some of the experts on the 26-member Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of novel pathogens (SAGO) took part in the WHO's joint mission to China to investigate the source of the virus.

Today [9 Jun 2022] they released their preliminary assessment, which said the closest relatives of SARS-CoV-2 are viruses isolated from Chinese bats in 2013 and Laotian bats in 2020. They said the Wuhan seafood market may have amplified the spread of the virus (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/scientific-advisory-group-on-the-origins-of-novel-pathogens-report).

The group said current data lean toward a zoonotic origin, but they said the possibility of a lab leak requires further investigation. SAGO had no new information to review that would support either possibility. It did evaluate new data on blood samples from Chinese donors in Wuhan shortly before the virus was first detected, which suggested that some samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, according to the Washington Post. However, they were later found to be false-positives (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/06/09/who-sago-covid-origins/).

In a video press release, Maria Van Kerkhove, PhD, the WHO's COVID-19 lead, said one of the SAGO report's major contributions is that it spells out studies that need to be done whenever a novel pathogen emerges, including SARS-CoV-2. She said suggested studies include a range of investigations, from genetic to epidemiologic. The list also details investigations in areas where pathogens emerge, covering a range of possible exposures, such as where animals came from and the possibility of lab breaches (https://who.canto.global/s/T4BSK?viewIndex=0).

Meanwhile, in other global developments, flare-ups in 2 Chinese cities -- Beijing and Shanghai -- led to tightened measures in districts where cases are spiking. Beijing closed entertainment venues in Dongcheng and Chaoyang districts, according to Reuters, which also reported that cases in Shanghai's Minhang district went on lockdown, with more rounds of mass testing planned for the city this weekend (https://www.reuters.com/world/china/another-district-beijing-shuts-entertainment-venues-contain-covid-outbreak-2022-06-09/).

[The same conclusion was reached as was found earlier, i.e., the most likely origin of SARS-CoV-2 was zoonotic. Perhaps the most significant contribution in the review came from Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's COVID-19 lead, who addressed need for studies whenever a novel pathogen emerges, including SARS-CoV-2, such as a range of investigations, from genetic to epidemiologic. The list also details investigations in areas where pathogens emerge, covering a range of possible exposures, such as where animals came from and the possibility of lab breaches. This is extremely important as the world will continue to see new pathogens and re-emergence of old pathogens. - Mod.LK]

The South Asia COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 10 Jun 2022 at 05:29 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 43 207 265 / 524 747 / 373
Bangladesh: 1 953 871 / 29 131 / 174
Pakistan: 1 531 037 / 30 381 / 133

Afghanistan: 180 784 / 7709 / 190
Maldives: 179 837 / 299 / 535
Bhutan: 59 636 / 21 / 27

Over the last 7 days, 37 666, 208, 483, 72, and 72 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared to 22 069, 198, 411, 58, and 45 in the preceding 7 days, revealing a state of stability in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, but a sharp increasing trend in India.

The numbers of new cases in India are significantly and sustainably increasing over the last 2 weeks, and such alarming growth of new cases is generating a kind of fear that this could be an initial signal of seeing the 4th wave of the disease in the country (https://www.timesnownews.com/india/covid-19-cases-in-india-coronavirus-update-active-cases-article-92095279).

The trends of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths attributed to the disease in Pakistan can be seen at https://covid19.who.int/region/emro/country/pk, and a recent update on COVID-19 new cases, recovered cases, and deaths caused by the disease in Nepal can be seen at https://covid19.mohp.gov.np.

In the last 7 days, the total number of people who died due to COVID-19 was 96 in India and 2 in Pakistan, but no one has died in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Over the last 24 hours, as of 10 Jun 2022 at 08:00 IST, COVID-19 deaths were reported from 1 union territory and 5 states of the 36 states and union territories in India -- 2 in Delhi, 17 in Kerala state, 2 in Rajasthan state and 1 each in Maharashtra state, Sikkim state and Uttar Pradesh state (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

As of 10 Jun 2022, at 08:00 IST (GMT+5:30) India has administered 1 947 642 992 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 70% of the population. As of 6 Jun 2022, 108.08% have received the 1st dose (against target) and 99.13% of the target population have received the 1st and 2nd doses. Around 20.34% of the target population have also received a 3rd dose as a booster vaccination (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).

As of 5 Jun 2022, Nepal has administered 47 141 797 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (https://covid19.who.int/region/searo/country/np).

Sri Lanka has administered at least 39 576 548 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine as of 6 Jun 2022 (https://covid19.who.int/region/searo/country/lk).
