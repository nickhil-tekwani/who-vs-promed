Cases of polioencephalitis and polioencephalomyelitis in cows and sheep --
conclusions of expert meeting
-----------------------------------------------------
An expert group last week considered the likely cause and public health
implications of cases of polioencephalitis and polioencephalomyelitis in
cattle and sheep in which, after routine investigation by the VLA, an
aetiological agent was not identified. The group's meeting, on 21 Jun 2004,
was convened by the Health Protection Agency and brought together
representatives from the fields of animal and human health including the
Department of the Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), Veterinary
Laboratories Agency (VLA), the Department of Health, independent experts,
and observers from the Food Standards Agency (FSA).
Details of a recently published and publicised case in a heifer, another
unrelated case in a bull, and 20 other cases in sheep were reviewed. In all
cases, investigations have eliminated a diagnosis of louping ill, an
endemic disease which could produce these pathological features. These
cases, which occurred over a period of 10 years, were considered against
the background of a fluctuating but not increasing rate of sample
submissions to the VLA for the investigation of non-notifiable nervous
diseases in cattle and sheep. In addition, a further 7 adult cattle with
similar neuropathological changes, submitted under BSE Orders between 2000
and 2003, were brought to the attention of the group. These animals were
examined for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) with negative results.
They had also been examined in the last 2 weeks for louping ill with
negative results
Although all of the animals had features characteristic of neurotropic
viral infections, review of the clinical and pathological findings revealed
that the 2 cattle in the initial series had different clinical features and
distribution of brain lesions. This suggested that they may represent
different conditions. The group also considered that the cases in sheep
presented several clinical and pathological variations and may have been
caused by more than one agent. The clinico-pathological observations in the
7 additional cattle cases submitted for statutory BSE diagnosis are limited
by virtue of the focus of the submission, but warrant further
investigation. In no cases were the pathological changes consistent with
those of a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. The group considered
that it was not unexpected to find this type of inflammatory lesion in a
small proportion of animals from which tissues are submitted for diagnostic
examinations.
Recent virologic testing identified an enterovirus in brain samples from
the heifer, and this is the likely cause of its condition. It was decided
to proceed with virologic testing for enteroviruses in the other cases in
cattle and sheep. The expert group considered that these cases were
unlikely to pose a significant risk to human health because:
-there is no apparent link between the low number of cases identified over
the past 10 years
-there is no increasing trend in samples submitted from cows or sheep with
neurological disease or the proportion diagnosed as having encephalitis
-none of the 29 animals in question would have entered the food chain
-if the aetiological diagnosis of enterovirus infection were substantiated
for the other cases, the species specificity of such viruses would, almost
certainly, rule out any pathogenicity for man based on currently available
evidence. In addition, as enteroviruses are easily destroyed by heat,
pasteurisation and cooking provide additional safeguards if milk or meat
from affected animals were to have entered the food chain.
The risk to public health will be reviewed in future as more information on
the other cases becomes available.
