At least 10 states are reporting an alarming increase in cases of severe hepatitis -- or inflammation of the liver -- in children. Previously healthy children are suddenly developing hepatitis, or liver inflammation often caused by viruses. Jaundice, diarrhea and abdominal pain are among reported symptoms. Children aged 1 month to 16 years have been affected.

In Minnesota, one of the latest to see cases, 2 children have required liver transplants. One of them still waiting. Wisconsin issued a health alert after 4 cases were reported, including one that resulted in death. Causes were also reported in Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, New York, North Carolina and Tennessee.

This comes days after the CDD shared clinical data from Alabama, where the first cases were found, showing that patients were from different parts of the state with no epidemiologic links.

A total of 3 pediatric patients in Indonesia died from acute hepatitis in April 2022, the country's health ministry said, boosting the global death toll from the mysterious liver ailment affecting children from the USA to Asia to at least 4. The children, hospitalized in the capital Jakarta, had symptoms including nausea, vomiting, heavy diarrhea, fever, jaundice, seizures and loss of consciousness, the ministry said in a statement on [Mon 2 May 2022] It is urging parents to immediately bring children who exhibit these symptoms to the hospital.

The ministry is running a full panel of tests to determine the cause of the disease and has issued a circular to step up nationwide surveillance for the illness, it said.

Over the weekend, Singapore confirmed a case of acute hepatitis in a 10-month old baby and is investigating whether it has a similar presentation to other cases reported worldwide. At least one other child has died from acute hepatitis, and more than a dozen others globally have undergone liver transplants after coming down with the disease, according to the WHO. While the cause of the sickness is yet to be determined, investigators are studying a family of pathogens called adenoviruses that cause a range of illnesses including the common cold.

A total of 2 cases of severe non-affiliated hepatitis were detected in children under the age of 16 in Andalucía between [1 Jan 2022] and [22 Apr 2022], according to a report from the Spanish Ministry of Health's Alerts and Emergencies Coordination Centre. One case has been confirmed and the other is considered probable.

In Spain as a whole, 13 cases were detected during that period, of which 8 meet the criteria established by the UK as confirmed cases which merit further investigation, and the other 5 are considered probable. The UK was the first country in which cases of hepatitis such as these were detected in children.

In Spain, the 8 confirmed cases (3 boys and 5 girls, aged between 18 months and 7 years) began to suffer symptoms between [2 Jan 2022] and [24 Mar 2022] and lived in the Madrid region, Catalonia (2), Galicia (2), Andalucía, Castilla-La Mancha and Aragón. None have any relationship with any of the others; one had made a trip to the UK, and in 1 case the child tested positive for adenovirus.

The children in Spain have recovered well, although one needed a liver transplant. The 5 probable cases, aged between 12 and 16 and with an onset of symptoms between [30 Dec 2021] and [1 Apr 2022], live in Catalonia (3), Andalucía (1) and Murcia (1). The incidence of non-affiliated hepatitis in Spain between 2016 and 2020, according to official figures, ranged from 4 to 10 cases a year.

If other related diagnostic categories are included, the average would be between 88 to 138 cases a year. "From the information we have received so far, up until now we have not observed a significant increase in cases of acute failure or severe acute hepatitis in children in Spain," says the Ministry of Health.

[More clinically compatible cases continue to be reported, it is not entirely clear how many of these are newly presenting or being found looking back at past cases over the past few months. A timeline of all the cases based on the day of initial symptoms would be very informative.

One possible cause, adenovirus serotype 41, one of the so-called enteric adenoviruses, has not been known previously to cause hepatitis in the immunologically normal host. Whether the finding of adenovirus serotype 41 is an epiphenomenon or the virus is etiologic here is not yet known. In this CDC report related to the Alabama cases (Hepatitis, undefined, global (03): USA (AL) children, CDC, poss adenovirus, 2021-22 20220430.8702942), which were seemingly recognized prior to European cases, no clear evidence of adenovirus in the affected liver tissue was found, and although type 41 was identified by hexon gene sequencing, it is not clear if a whole genomic analysis of the virus has been compared to older adenovirus serotype 41. Hexon is the major surface coat protein of adenovirus. If the virus is the cause, has the agent acquired additional virulence factors, or is a cofactor involved (virus or toxin)? Are certain children genetically more susceptible for the more severe disease? It has been suggested that using deep sequencing metagenetics of the affected liver tissue and blood may well be the best methodology.

To this point, no evidence for household clusters has been reported, which one might expect if a foodborne toxin or transmissible agent was involved. Additionally, it would be interesting to know if any asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations were looked for in household contacts. The cases recognized as severe could be the "tip of the iceberg," as we saw with paralytic poliomyelitis when only a small percentage of infections resulted in the classical asymmetrical flaccid paralysis of polio. - Mod.LL
