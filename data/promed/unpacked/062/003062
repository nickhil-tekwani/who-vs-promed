Preliminary testing of a dead oriental magpie robin found in Yuen Long
has come out positive for H5 avian influenza virus, a spokesman for
the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said
today (19 Jan 2011), adding that further confirmatory tests were being
conducted.

The bird's carcass was found and collected on 17 Jan 2011 near a
refuse collection point at Fairview Park, Yuen Long. The oriental
magpie robin is a common resident bird in Hong Kong.

The AFCD has reminded the property management company to step up
cleansing and disinfection.

The spokesman said that the Mai Po Nature Reserve (MPNR) and 3 chicken
farms are within 3 km [1.8 mi] of where the bird was found. AFCD staff
inspected the farms and found no abnormal mortality or symptoms of
avian influenza among the chicken flocks. These farms will be put
under enhanced surveillance.

The MPNR will remain open to the public. The AFCD will maintain close
communication with the MPNR to ensure that the existing precautionary
measures against avian influenza will be enhanced to safeguard public
health.

In view of this case, the AFCD has called on poultry farmers reminding
them to strengthen precautionary and biosecurity measures against
avian influenza. Letters will be issued to farmers, pet bird shop
owners, licence holders of pet poultry and racing pigeons, reminding
them that proper precautions must be taken.

The spokesman said the department would conduct frequent inspections
of poultry farms and the wholesale market to ensure that proper
precautions against avian influenza have been implemented. The
department will continue its wild bird monitoring and surveillance.

In addition, AFCD staff has inspected 369 villages in Hong Kong since
4 Jan 2011. So far, unauthorised keeping of poultry has not been
observed. The inspections will continue.

A ban on backyard poultry has been in force since 2006. Unauthorised
keeping of 5 kinds of poultry -- chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons and
quails -- is an offence with a maximum fine of [HKD] 50 000 [approx.
USD 6400]. Repeat offenders are subject to a maximum fine of [HKD] 100
000 [approx. USD 12 800].

"People should avoid personal contact with wild birds and live poultry
and their droppings. They should clean their hands thoroughly after
coming into contact with them. The public can call the Call Centre on
1823 for followup if they come across suspicious sick or dead birds,
including the carcasses of wild birds and poultry," the spokesman said.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will continue to
be vigilant over imported live poultry as well as live poultry stalls.
It will also remind stall operators to maintain good hygiene.

The Department of Health will keep up with its health education to
remind the public to maintain strict personal and environmental
hygiene to prevent avian influenza.

The AFCD, FEHD, the Customs and Excise Department, and the Police will
strive to deter the illegal import of poultry and birds into Hong Kong
to minimise the risk of avian influenza outbreaks caused by those that
have not gone through inspection and quarantine.

All relevant government departments will continue to remain highly
vigilant and strictly enforce preventive measures against avian
influenza.

Under the present avian influenza surveillance programme on dead wild
birds, test results showed that a dead large-billed crow found in Tai
O was confirmed to be H5N1 positive, a spokesman for the Agriculture,
Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said.

The bird carcass was collected at Sun Ki Street, Tai O on 18 Jan 2011.
It was highly decomposed when found and required a series of tests
before avian influenza was confirmed today [21 Jan 2011].

The spokesman said there were no poultry farms within 3 km [1.8 mi] of
where the dead bird was found. The large-billed crow is a common
resident bird in Hong Kong.

In addition, a dead oriental magpie robin collected on 17 Jan 2011
near a refuse collection point at Fairview Park, Yuen Long was also
confirmed to be H5N1 positive after laboratory testing.

The AFCD has phoned poultry farmers to remind them to strengthen
precautionary and biosecurity measures against avian influenza.

[This report adds details to the previous OIE report posted on ProMED
on 22 Jan 2011, Avian influenza (07): Hong Kong, H5N1, wild birds, OIE
20110122.0266. Subscribers are encouraged to read the report and
comments.

Tai O is a little village of 5000 inhabitants on the western shore of
Lantau Island, which is to the west of the city of Hong Kong.

This winter season (2010-2011) we have had H5N1 confirmation from Hong
Kong in humans, poultry, and wildlife, but no widespread outbreak. The
surveillance and regulations enacted in Hong Kong, including the
inspection of 369 villages since 4 Jan 2011, a ban on backyard poultry
since 2006, and heavy fines for unauthorised keeping of poultry so far
seems to be effective in controlling the spread of the disease.

Although all cases from China this season have been concentrated in
Hong Kong, the human case from Hong Kong likely contracted H5N1 in
Mainland China (Shanghai, Nanjing, or Hangzhou) during her travels
between 23 Oct 2010 and 1 Nov 2010. But to this day, no source of the
infection has been found in Mainland China.
(See Avian influenza, human (60): China (Hong Kong) 20101122.4228)

The confirmation in a large-billed crow is not surprising, since crows
are scavengers. If there are dead chicken carcasses infected with H5N1
in the open, as previously reported in ProMED-mail Avian influenza
(66): Hong Kong, HPAI H5, chicken, OIE 20101224.4529, any scavenging
birds ingesting the infected carcass could become infected. Notice
also that the oriental magpie robin was found near a refuse collection
point. As backyard poultry keeping is banned and almost all poultry
farms are now in a closed system, no wild birds should be able to get
into the pens. But chickens infected with H5N1, if not properly
destroyed and left in the open, could be a source of H5N1 infection
for scavenging birds.

Ongoing vigilance and surveillance in both poultry and wildlife must continue.

From 22 to 25 Jan 2011, no further cases have been reported in Hong Kong.
