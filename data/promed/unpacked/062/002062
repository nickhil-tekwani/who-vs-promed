When wildlife pathologists arrived at Hay Island off the coast of Nova Scotia in March 2012, they met an eerie sight. Of the thousands of silver and black-speckled gray seals that lay on the rocky outcrop, roughly one fifth were dead, despite showing no outward signs of disease. Necropsies revealed that 406 dead seals were infested with a crescent moon-shaped parasite that had destroyed their livers, but it wasn't clear what the organism was or how the seals had contracted the parasite. Researchers revealed the parasite's identity here today [14 Feb 2014] at the annual meeting of AAAS, which publishes Science. They also explained how melting ice in the Arctic Circle is helping such pathogens disperse throughout the world's oceans.

The parasite in question belongs to the genus _Sarcocystis_. It doesn't always kill its host; ring seals, for example, have long lived with the crescent moon-shaped microbe with little ill effect. In gray seals, however, the parasite appears to follow a different pattern of infestation. Rather than low-level infection, "it completely destroys the architecture" of liver cells, says Michael Grigg of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. After examining the dead gray seals' tissue under an electron microscope and tracing the parasite's genetic lineage, Grigg and colleagues at other institutions identified it as a close relative of _Sarcocystis canis_, found in dogs. They named the new strain _Sarcocystis pinnipedi_ (pinniped is the scientific term for seals).

Because ring seals depend on ice to build caves for their young, they have historically remained isolated from gray seals, which inhabit warmer waters. As roughly one third of the ice covering the Arctic has disappeared over the past 30 years, however, gray seals have begun to follow their favorite prey into the ring seals' territory, says Sue Moore, a biological oceanographer at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Office of Science and Technology in Seattle, Washington. Because their habitats are starting to overlap, these species are beginning to mix for the 1st time, exposing them to new diseases and parasites, she says.

Loss of Arctic ice isn't just allowing pathogens once trapped in higher latitudes to escape; it may also be enabling parasites once found only in lower latitudes to move north, says Stephen Raverty, a veterinary pathologist at the British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture in Vancouver, Canada. For the 1st time, Raverty and colleagues have discovered the cat parasite _Toxoplasma gondii_, which can cause infectious blindness and abortions in people, in western Arctic beluga whale meat, a staple food for the Inuit people. It's not yet clear how the pathogen first reached the whales, he notes. One possibility is that the Inuit are keeping more cats as pets, because kitty litter flushed down the toilet is a major source of the parasite in the environment. But loss of Arctic ice is also likely eroding the ecological barrier that has previously protected beluga whales, allowing the parasite to move northward, he says.

Time will tell whether these exposures are flukes or the tip of the iceberg as ice in the Arctic melts, Grigg says. As some scientists estimate that all ice in the Arctic will be gone within 20 years, more research linking climate change to the health of marine mammals is critical, Moore notes.

What is noteworthy here is the identification of a parasite in a species in which it has not been found before. The necropsy provides hard, tangible evidence that the gray seals have a _Sarcocystis_ parasite. What appears to be speculation is the cause. There is only speculation that Arctic warming and melting ice have allowed a new species access to this parasite. - Mod.TG

Gathering evidence that links disease to climate change or other interacting sources of ongoing environmental change is extremely difficult. Climate change may directly modify the patterns of transmissible diseases basically in 2 ways:
1. Favoring pathogens (increasing pathogen and/or vector proliferation, or pathogen and/or vector survivability)
2. Increasing the host's susceptibility to infection.

One of the effects of climate change on wildlife is disturbed trophic behavior. For instance, the reduction in sea ice is causing a change in the behavior and diet of walruses, which are becoming more pelagic (living in the open sea) and are preying more on ringed seals (a carnivore) and less on invertebrates. This, in turn, may increase the prevalence of trichinellosis in walruses. Similar mechanisms may be contributing to the occurrence of previously unrecorded pathogens in Arctic wildlife. - Mod.PMB]
