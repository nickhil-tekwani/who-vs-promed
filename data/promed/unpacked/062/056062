ANTHRAX, LABORATORY EXPOSURE - FRANCE (02)

From: Pascal Boireau <p.boireau@afssa.fr>


[Dr.Boireau contacted ProMED and, over the telephone, described what
happened.]

One of the Afssa technicians was preparing DNA in their Level 3
Laboratory by transferring a colony [of anthrax from a culture] to
distilled water in a glass vial, which was then heat-inactivated for
DNA processing. They normally submerge this glass tube in boiling
water for 20 minutes and then check that there are no surviving cells
or spores by plating out a loopful on sheep blood agar and reading the
plate after 24 hours.

Due to new regulations in the Level 3 Laboratory, they had just gone
over to dry heating the glass vial and supernatant on a hot plate at
99 C for 20 minutes. Vials were then centrifuged and the supernatant
recovered. As before, a check loopful was plated out on sheep agar
for each supernatant, but because of the many hundreds of times this
had been done before without anything growing [the culture had always
been killed], the technician took the 6 vials of heated supernatant
out of the Level 3+ lab and went to the Level 2 DNA laboratory before
she had read the check plates the next day. The technician opened the
vial after centrifugation in a
safety cabinet.

The exposure, if any, was trivial, but the personnel in the Level 2
laboratory were given antibiotics.
