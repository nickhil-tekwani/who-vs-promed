SALMONELLA INFECTIONS - USA (KANSAS & MISSOURI)
===============================================
Date: Wed, 7 May 97 11:34:25 UT
From: "Gerald Hoff" <Jerry_Diane@msn.com>
There is an outbreak of _Salmonella infantis_ occurring in east-central
Kansas with a few cases in west-central Missouri. Over 2 dozen cases have
occurred and, to the best of my knowledge, no source has been identified. We
have investigated four of the Missouri cases. We have been told that thus
far typing of isolates has not yielded a consistent picture and that a
similar sized outbreak also has/is occurring in northwest Tennessee. Could
anyone shed any more light as to what is going on in either Kansas or Tennessee?
My staff have their hands full with a _Salmonella agona_ outbreak from a
food establishment: >60 laboratory confirmed cases to date and counting. In
this instance it appears a single batch of baked beans was
cross-contaminated (mostly likely from poultry) and the beans were catered
out within a 1-1.5 hour time frame.
Last fall we had a _Salmonella braenderup_ outbreak from a pancake
establishment with 32 clinical and 9 asymptomatic cases. Seems like
west-central Missouri and east-central Kansas have become Salmonella central
over the last 6-8 months.

[Would someone with authoritative information let Gerald (and ProMED-mail)
know what is happening with _Salmonella infantis_ in Kansas & Tennessee. And
thanks to him for providing ProMED-mail with the information on his own
outbreaks. We sometimes get complaints about using newspaper reports. Let me
assure you all that we always prefer getting and passing on outbreak
information from those in the trenches. AHEAD-Mod MHJ]
