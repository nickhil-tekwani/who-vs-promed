Anthrax has again appeared in South Dakota livestock. Dr Sam Holland, state
veterinarian, reports the disease has struck a large buffalo [Plains Bison]
and livestock ranch in Northwestern Sully County. The State Veterinarian
was called on Wed 20 Jul 2005 and specimens were collected and taken to the
lab, which confirmed the diagnosis on Thu 21 Jul.
Dr Holland reports that the case involves a pasture containing a group of
about 300 unvaccinated buffalo and rodeo bulls, with losses including about
40 head, consisting of primarily adult buffalo and 2 rodeo bulls. The herd
was scheduled to be immediately treated with antibiotics, vaccinated, and
carcasses properly disposed of under the supervision of the Animal Industry
Board.
Anthrax is a very serious quarantinable disease because it can cause the
rapid loss of a large number of animals in a very short time. Often animals
are found dead with no illness detected. Anthrax is also communicable to
humans, as well as other animals, through carcasses, so that strict
enforcement of quarantine and proper burning and burying of carcasses
suspected to have died from anthrax is important. Anthrax is not usually
spread from animal to animal, and quarantines are imposed to prevent
further soil contamination by movement of affected livestock. Producers are
alerted to outbreaks so they can consult their veterinarians and vaccinate
their livestock if deemed appropriate.
Dr Holland reports that anthrax spores survive in contaminated soil
indefinitely and that much of South Dakota has the potential of
experiencing an outbreak. Significant climate changes such as drought,
floods, and winds can expose Anthrax spores to grazing livestock. Alkaline
soils, high humidity and high temperatures present conditions for the
Anthrax spores to vegetate and become infectious to grazing livestock.
Dr Holland says he advised practicing veterinarians to be alert for Anthrax
in his July newsletter. Rendering companies have also been alerted so that
carcasses are not rendered but properly burned and buried on the farm.

Anthrax discovered in Sully County
----------------------------------
An outbreak of anthrax has been reported in South Dakota, with the disease
killing 40 buffalo and 2 bulls in a Sully County pasture. The pasture
contained about 300 buffalo and rodeo bulls, said South Dakota state
veterinarian Sam Holland. The herd was to be treated with vaccines and
antibiotics immediately and the infected animals' remains were to be
destroyed [burnt].
Sully County is in central South Dakota, north of Pierre. South Dakota
officials warned ranchers last week that weather and soil conditions were
favorable for anthrax, which becomes more infectious and more easily spread
during the heat and humidity after heavy rains.
"Alkaline soils, high humidity and high temperatures present conditions for
the anthrax spores to vegetate and become infectious to grazing livestock,"
Holland said. "It's not uncommon to find traces of anthrax in soil," he
said. "Animals often are found dead with no illness detected. The disease
can be communicated to humans and other animals through carcasses, hides or
meat, so quarantine and proper burning and burying of infected animals are
important."
During 2004, only one case of anthrax in cattle was reported in South
Dakota. In 2003, 2 cases were confirmed. In 2002, 9 cases were reported and
53 cattle in Butte and Meade counties died.
The disease also was found in south eastern North Dakota. Beth Carlson,
deputy state veterinarian in North Dakota, said that as of Wednesday night,
anthrax had been confirmed at 27 locations, all in the south eastern part
of the state. Carlson said North Dakota keeps records of the number of
premises on which anthrax appears, not the number of cases reported.

[Multiplication of _Bacillus anthracis_ in soil is one of those "facts" one
finds in textbooks, but it is hard to prove that it really happens. If it
did happen at the frequency claimed, we would never get rid of the disease;
and patently its incidence is decreasing significantly in many countries.
To multiply it needs nutrients, which are rarely sufficient in soil; but it
does nicely if you add blood -- but that is not the same thing. Minette &
Dhanda in 1944 showed that it could multiply and survive in soil only if a
culture was added to sterilised soil -- that is, it is a poor competitor.
What is more important is survival of spores in soil and their reaching the
surface. Thus, when the disease is infrequent, one begins to see sporadic
outbreaks in relation to earth-moving events, such as disc plowing, scrub
clearing, bull-dozing, trench digging and clearing, and river/stream bed
disturbance from flooding -- usually downstream from closed tanneries and
such. I suspect that heavy rains can loosen up the soil surface, allowing
spores to float up into the root mass of the graze and then be eaten by
grazing cows. Remember, cows are 800-lb ballet dancers walking around on
their 2 toes on each foot, and this will compact soil. As the disease gets
less common, ranchers no longer appreciate the risk and therefore their
stock go unvaccinated. That is fine if your pastures are not contaminated.
High temperatures stress animals, with the result that their innate
resistance is decreased and therefore they will be susceptible to infective
doses far below normal. Once you have one animal down, spread can then
occur via biting flies. - Mod.MHJ]
