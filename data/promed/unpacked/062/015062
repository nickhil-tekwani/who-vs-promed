There are now 62 confirmed reports of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), an illness similar to polio, across 22 states in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As of 20 Sep [2018], the CDC had confirmed 38 cases in 16 states, which are not required to report AFM cases to the CDC.

This year's [2018] numbers are similar to 2016 and 2014. Since 2014, 386 cases have been confirmed, the CDC said on Tuesday [16 Oct 2018]. Currently, 127 patients are under investigation. The average age of those afflicted is 4 years, and 90 percent of those with AFM are 18 years or younger.

"This remains a rare syndrome, but the similarities to poliomyelitis, polio-like illness, are concerning and bear close monitoring," Dr. Todd Ellerin, director of infectious diseases at South Shore Hospital in Weymouth [Massachusetts, USA], told ABC News in an interview. "Now is it going to be as widespread as that? Hopefully not. And that's why we have to keep our eye on this."

AFM affects the spinal cord and can cause partial paralysis. It mostly afflicts children and young adults and can be caused by toxins in one's environment, genetic disorders or viruses such as poliovirus, West Nile virus or adenovirus.

Another potential cause of AFM is a type of enterovirus called EV D68, Dr. Ellerin said. "That's important because enteroviruses cause the common cold," he added. "It causes fever illnesses in the summer and fall, often associated with rashes. It causes hand, foot and mouth disease. It causes a lot of what [are] typically very mild sort of nuisance-type diseases."

Typical symptoms of AFM are like those of a severe respiratory illness, along with a fever, but often progress into neurological symptoms. Some patients with AFM will feel weakness in their arms or legs, a loss of muscle tone or slower reflexes. The most severe symptom is respiratory failure. People can protect themselves from contracting AFM using methods similar to preventing the flu, Ellerin said.

So far the disease has claimed one life in the US. Ellerin said the staff at his hospital has been trained to recognize symptoms, and he encourages medical centers to train employees similarly before it is too late. "We want to see that education," he said, "in order to have early recognition and detection."

State and national health authorities are raising the alarm about a polio-like "mystery illness" that has left dozens of children with paralysis and other symptoms in Massachusetts and 21 other states. At present, 2 cases of the disease -- acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) -- have been confirmed in Massachusetts with another 4 cases under investigation. Nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 62 cases this year [2018] and a total of 386 since 2014.

"We know this can be frightening for parents," said Dr. Nancyâ€‰ Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. She said the average age of AFM patients is 4 years.

"There is a lot we don't know about AFM and I am frustrated that despite all of our efforts, we haven't been able to identify the cause of this mystery illness," Messonnier said. She said that most AFM cases occur in the late summer and fall.

There is no known cause or treatment, a state Department of Public Health advisory said. The disease is marked by a sudden onset of weakness and loss of muscle tone in the arms and legs caused by an attack on the nervous system and spinal cord.

According to yesterday's [16 Oct 2018] warning issued by the CDC, the disease could be linked to environmental toxins, genetic disorders or other viruses such as West Nile. The long-term effects of the disease are also unknown.

Messonnier said some patients diagnosed with AFM have recovered quickly, whereas others continue to struggle with paralysis. There has been one AFM-related death, which happened in 2017.

Other symptoms of AFM include facial droop, difficulty moving the eyes, drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing and slurred speech. The most severe symptom of AFM is respiratory failure, which can happen when the muscles needed to breathe become weak from the disease.

There were 120 cases in 2014 when the disease was 1st detected in the US. The highest number of cases took place in 2016, when 149 were reported cases in 39 states.

"This is a mystery and we haven't solved it yet, so we have to be thinking broadly," said Messonnier, adding, "You'd think that we would [be] finding a single agent [but] that's not what we're finding."

So far, AFM has affected fewer than one in a million people in the US each year. The CDC is actively investigating and monitoring disease activity and recommends taking standard prevention measures such as hand washing, protecting oneself from mosquito bites and staying up to date on vaccinations.

[3] CDC warning

A rare but devastating polio-like virus appears to have made itself at home in the US, partially paralyzing hundreds of children. There have been 127 cases reported in 22 states so far this year [2018], with 62 confirmed as acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). She announced the numbers in a Tuesday [16 Oct 2018] media briefing.

This year's [2018] outbreak marks the 3rd wave of AFM to hit the US since 2014, and this wave is on track to be the worst yet, experts say. Even more troubling, the actual number of cases might be higher. A recent CNN report found that 30 states were investigating 47 confirmed cases and another 49 suspected cases. AFM cases tend to start in August, peak in October and taper off by December, according to the CDC.

"We need to pay attention to this, because the long-term consequences the children and their parents suffer is immense," said Dr. Carlos Pardo-Villamizar, a neurological disease expert with Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore [Maryland, USA]. "You can't imagine the amount of suffering these kids have in their lives."

Viral culprits?
-----------
AFM 1st appeared in 2014, when 120 children across 34 states were stricken with mysterious muscle weakness. Another wave hit in 2016, with 149 patients affected in 39 states.

The syndrome is suspected to be caused by one or more viruses. Enterovirus (EV) D68, a virus from the same family as polio, is the leading suspect, having been closely linked to the 2014 outbreak, Pardo-Villamizar said.

But according to Dr. Keith Van Haren, "There's a likelihood it may be associated with other viruses." He is an assistant professor and child neurologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine [California, USA]. A research team led by Van Haren was the 1st to link AFM with EV D68 back in 2015.

But an outbreak of the syndrome now occurring in Colorado has been associated with EV A71, a strain that is much more common in southeast Asia, said Dr. Samuel Dominguez, a pediatric infectious disease expert with Children's Hospital Colorado.

CDC officials have not confirmed any specific cause of AFM, Messonnier said. Samples from some patients revealed the presence of enteroviruses, but others had been infected with a rhinovirus.

The CDC also has not ruled out either environmental toxins or some sort of autoimmune disorder as potential causes of AFM, Messonnier added. "I am frustrated that despite all our efforts we haven't been able to identify the cause of this mystery illness," Messonnier said.

Devastating symptoms
---------------------
AFM typically causes weakness in the arms and legs but can affect other muscle groups. In the most severe cases, patients suffer respiratory failure when the muscles involved with breathing become weak, the CDC says. Follow-up with patients from the 2014 and 2016 waves has shown that most children do not recover from AFM, for which there currently is no cure.

In September [2018], Pardo-Villamizar and his colleagues published a follow-up of 16 patients stricken in 2016 that concluded that "the majority of children with AFM have limited motor recovery and continued disability." The study was published in the journal Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology.

Doctors in Colorado experienced the same with children who fell ill in 2014, Dominguez said. "We followed our children for over a year," Dominguez said. "Several of the kids did recover, but the majority of them still had permanent deficits a year out."

The particular strain of virus might have something to do with the severity of AFM and how long its effects last. "There's better recovery this year in the kids we're seeing here with EV A71," Dominguez said, as opposed to EV D68.

At this point, doctors are not sure how the viruses cause AFM. Pardo-Villamizar said, "We don't know if the virus is attacking directly the spinal cord, or if the immune response against the virus is producing the damage to the spinal cord."

The experts emphasized that even though AFM is regularly passing through the US, it remains a rare illness. Most kids who contract an enterovirus only suffer an upper respiratory infection, Pardo-Villamizar and Dominguez said. It is only a small handful of children who progress to the muscle weakness associated with AFM.

There's no vaccine that can protect against AFM-causing enteroviruses. Parents who want to protect their children should encourage the same sort of good hygiene that protects kids against cold and flu, such as washing their hands frequently and covering coughs or sneezes, Dominguez said. "Good advice now is good advice going into the influenza season," Dominguez said.

Parents of a sick child should be on the lookout for any signs of weakness in the arms or legs, Pardo-Villamizar said. "If children develop an upper respiratory infection and there is any hint of muscle weakness, those patients need to be evaluated rapidly by a pediatrician and an emergency department," he said. "They need to be followed very carefully, because this is a very aggressive disease. In a matter of hours, the children are paralyzed. They may need respiratory support."

[AFM is a serious but uncommon condition. It affects a person's nervous system, specifically the spinal cord. AFM and neurologic conditions like it have a variety of causes, including viruses, environmental toxins, and genetic disorders. The viruses can include enteroviruses, West Nile virus and viruses in the same family, and adenoviruses.

Much is still unknown about AFM, and often a cause for AFM cannot be identified. Symptoms can include sudden onset of limb weakness and loss of muscle tone and reflexes, facial droop/weakness, difficulty moving the eyes, drooping eyelids, and difficulty with swallowing or slurred speech.

The CDC has tested many different specimens from AFM patients for a wide range of pathogens that can cause AFM. To date, no pathogen has been consistently detected in the patients' spinal fluid; a pathogen detected in the spinal fluid would be good evidence to indicate the cause of AFM because this condition affects the spinal cord.

It seems that a definitive laboratory diagnosis of the AFM cases is still not clear, but most importantly epidemiological factors that led to the increase in cases during the 2014 outbreak are not well understood and the current one seems no different. - Mod.UBA
