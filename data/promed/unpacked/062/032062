Russia's military officials say that efforts to prevent an anthrax epidemic have been increased at a Russian air base in Kyrgyzstan because of an outbreak of anthrax nearby.

Officials from Russia's Central Military District say one of the outbreaks is within 20 km of the Kant Air Base in Kyrgyzstan's northern region of Chui. He says all military buildings on the base -- including apartments for officers and their families -- have been disinfected, and safety checks on food supplies have been increased.

The move was undertaken after Kyrgyz health officials announced last week that several cases of anthrax had been confirmed in Chui and in the southern regions of Jalal-abad and Batken.
