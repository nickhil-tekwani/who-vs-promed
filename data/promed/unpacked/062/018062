Kyrgyzstan: hepatitis on the increase in southern Kyrgyzstan
-----------------------------------------------
Epidemiological services are seeing a steep rise in the number of acute
viral hepatitis cases in southern Kyrgyzstan. In Osh alone, the country's
2nd largest city, about 100 people have been hospitalized with hepatitis
over the past month [September 2004], local epidemiologists told IRIN on
Tue 28 Sep 2004. Officials at the Osh Regional Epidemiological Control
Center say that this year's [2004] hepatitis incidence rate exceeds last
year's level by 50 percent. The number of infected people is increasing in
rural areas, including the Kara-Suu, Aravan, and Uzgen districts, where one
or 2 patients are hospitalized with hepatitis each day.
"Hepatitis A is the most common type. Around 95 percent of patients are
diagnosed with it," Adakhamjan Abdimominov, head of the infectious diseases
section of Osh regional hospital, told IRIN. "The majority of infected are
children of pre-school age." According to him, such a seasonal rise of
hepatitis occurs every 3 to 5 years. Hepatitis means "inflammation of the
liver," and the most common cause is infection with one of 5 viruses,
called hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. All of them can cause an acute disease
with symptoms lasting several weeks, including yellowing of the skin and
eyes (jaundice), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and
abdominal pain. It can take several months to a year to feel fit again.
According to official statistics, about 1500 people became infected with
various forms of hepatitis in Osh province over the past 8 months. Almost
1200 of them were children under 14.
Roughly 5 percent of all those infected suffer the [serious] forms of the
disease -- caused by hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses -- which are
difficult to cure. According to the local epidemiological service, it takes
almost USD 300 to diagnose and treat one patient with hepatitis A, more
than USD 370 for hepatitis C, and about USD 450, on average, is required
for a patient with hepatitis B. The average monthly salary in Kyrgyzstan is
no more than USD 35, while in rural areas it is even lower. Although
hospital administrators assert that funds from the state budget and
obligatory medical insurance suffice, many patients complained to IRIN that
they had to buy most of the drugs themselves.
In an effort to mitigate the risk, a number of centers have been
established in Osh city and province to coordinate ongoing preventive
measures. The regional authorities say that teams of physicians on the
ground were calling on households in an effort to raise their awareness and
monitor the situation. Artykbai Eraliev, deputy chief doctor of the Osh
regional epidemiological control center, emphasized the importance of
taking preventive measures in the foci of the disease, adding that health
officials who were involved needed support, while resources remained
scanty. According to health officials, the sanitary and epidemiological
services lack the necessary means -- only half a ton of disinfectants
remains at the regional epidemiological control center -- while virology
laboratories are in dire need of reagents to diagnose hepatitis virus
infections.
Meanwhile, in Kazakhstan, some 300 people have been registered with viral
hepatitis over the past month [September 2004] in central Karaganda
province. "Around 300 people have been registered in Abay town [Karaganda
province] with viral hepatitis, including 250 children," a Kazakh health
official told IRIN from the Kazakh capital, Astana. "The recent cases were
caused by a breakdown in the city's water supply system, which is old and
hasn't been repaired for 20 years. That resulted in the sucking-in of
sewage and subsequent contamination of the drinking water network," the
health expert explained.

[Hepatitis A and E are caused by enteric viruses and are the easiest forms
of the disease to control, because acute disease resolves, and neither
virus becomes persistent. Improvements in infrastructure, such as the
upgrading of drinking water supplies and sewage treatment plants, are the
best protection. There is also an effective hepatitis A vaccine for
protection of vulnerable groups. Although there is no comparable hepatitis
E vaccine, control can be achieved by improvements in infrastructure.
Hepatitis E virus is the more dangerous, because women in their 3rd
trimester of pregnancy are at greatest risk of damaging disease. The other
hepatitis viruses are blood-borne and more insidious, because they are
prone to establish persistent infections with long-term deleterious
consequences. Hepatitis B is controllable by vaccination, but there is no
comparable hepatitis C vaccine. Hepatitis D virus is dependent on hepatitis
B virus and can be eradicated by containment of hepatitis B virus. - Mod.CP]
