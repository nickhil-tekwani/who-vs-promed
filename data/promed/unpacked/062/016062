The quarantine measures in the Vladimir region, imposed in response to the foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] outbreak, have been removed, according to the news agency RIA Novosti, citing Vladimir Nagorny, Head of Rosselkhoznadzor for Vladimir.

The measures have been applied since 20 Oct 2016, when the outbreak was 1st confirmed. FMD-susceptible animals were separated and culled. It was decided to vaccinate all animals in the region. Nagorno told RIA Novosti that the last animal was euthanized on 25 Oct [2016]; since no additional case has occurred during the subsequent 21 days, the disease can be regarded as eradicated, victory over the FMD outbreak can be announced. At the same time, he said, vigilance should be maintained, farms protected, unauthorized visitors kept away and control upon animal feed and upon the movements of the staff members, including their contact persons, continued. There is no room for relaxing yet.

[2] Event resolved, compensations

Governor Svetlana Orlova has signed a decree to lift the quarantine on the FMD-affected village Vyshmanovo and the restrictive measures on the territory of the Sobinsk area.

The elimination of the FMD epizootic in the territory of the production facilities "Yard number 2" and "Yard number 3" of "CPA" in the said village, has been completed. The total number of vaccinated animals in the Vladimir region is 134 647 head of cattle and 26 277 head of sheep and goats. At present, revaccination of cattle is advancing. Budget for the compensation to be paid to agricultural enterprises and to private holdings whose animals were culled has been allocated within the region. The rate of compensation was calculated by the Veterinary Department of the Vladimir region. This will be: for young cattle, 160 rubles [about USD 2.5] per kg live weight; for cows, 130 rubles [about USD 2] per kg live weight; for pigs up to 4 months of age, 160 rubles per kg live weight; for pigs older than 4 months, 97 rubles [about USD 1.5] per kg body weight; for sheep and goats, 164 rubles per kg live weight [press-service of the regional administration].

[A TV news program, covering the termination of the epizootic, can be viewed at http://www.6tv.ru/news/view/28703/.

The early withdrawal of the quarantine and other restrictive measures in Vladimir has become possible due to the swift response of the veterinary authorities to the detection of the focus, the immediate implementation of stamping out (with the army's logistic support) and the application of mass vaccination. The successful application of the vaccine and its efficacy deserves to be indicative of knowledge on the genotype of the pathogen involved and the compatibility of available vaccine.

Interestingly, in an interview with the Director of the Veterinary Department of the Vladimir regional administration, similarly dated 17 Nov 2016, the official said, "In 2015, vaccination was stopped [to obtain OIE's recognition of Russia's main territory as 'FMD-free zone without vaccination'], and in 2016 we have a 'foreign' virus. You do not find that such a sequence of events gives cause for reflection?"

He further referred to a suspicion that the FMD event could have been related to an "economic sabotage" (http://www.vedom.ru/news/2016/11/17/23194-direktor).

The origin of the FMDV Asia 1 strain behind this unusual event will become clearer, suspicions of foul play confirmed or -- hopefully -- rather excluded, if/when its genotyped profile becomes public. This can be done, by the inclusion of the genotyping results in the due final report to the OIE, declaring the event "resolved". - Mod.AS
