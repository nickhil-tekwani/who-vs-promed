Location: Romania; Event: CCHF
--------------------------------
A study realised in 2008 and published in 2012 reports for the 1st time the evidence for the circulation of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHF) in Romania.

This study took place in the district of Tulcea, Northern Dobrogea and shows that 28 percent of sheep were IgG positive for CCHF virus.

The reservoir and vector of this pathogen, the tick _Hyalomma marginatum_, is already present in Romania.

Comment:
Although in humans, infection with CCHF virus is usually pauci-asymptomatic, it can also lead to an haemorrhagic viral fever, sometimes associated to secondary transmission in clinical setting. Infection among animals is asymptomatic.

Human cases of CCHF (seropositive cases and clinical cases) are regularly reported in Romania's neighbouring countries and almost all around the Black Sea. Recent cases of CCHF in Kosovo were reported in eWEB No 230 (August 2012) [see at http://www.episouthnetwork.org/sites/default/files/bulletin_file/eweb_230_14_08_12.pdf].

The recent discovery of a seroprevalence in animals in Romania indicates the extension of the circulation zone of CCHF in Europe.

The geographic distribution of CCHF coincides with that of _Hyalomma_ ticks. _H. marginatum_, the main CCHF virus vector in Europe, is found in Albania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Kosovo, Moldavia, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia,
Spain, Turkey, and the Ukraine. In 2006 it was detected for the 1st time in the Netherlands and in southern Germany.
