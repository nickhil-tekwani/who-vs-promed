From: Scott Bishop

This incident illustrates two important points:
1)the need for travelers to get yellow fever (and all other) vaccines
before traveling outside of [their country, and
2)the potential outbreak on the horizon.
The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito has reemerged in many places along the Gulf
coast of the United States, such as Houston, Galveston and New Orleans. An
incident such as the
one described here could lead to the urban type outbreak that could have
dramatic effects when unleashed on a YF naive population. Coupled with the
example from NYC [of West Nile virus importation and the difficulty in
identifying a rare pathogen, the results could be an unfortunate loss of
life.
The need to further educate International travelers about the vaccination
and prophylaxis guidelines has never been more vital than in our
exceptionally mobile society. As well, local & state health departments
must expand their knowledge about rare diseases so as to be prepared to act
at the first sign of an outbreak.
