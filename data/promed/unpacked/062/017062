The number of women infected with hepatitis C [virus] after being
treated by a Melbourne doctor has grown to 44 and is rising. Another
32 women have tested positive to the infection after being treated by
James Latham Peters, an anaesthetist at a Croydon abortion clinic, the
Department of Human Services (DHS) revealed on Monday [31 May 2010].
That number is certain to grow and the DHS has urged any women who
have had abortions and been treated by Dr Peters at the Croydon Day
Surgery to contact them.

More than 1100 women treated by Dr Peters since 2008 have been
contacted by DHS and told to be tested, with the results of 746 women
received showing 32 infection cases, Victoria's chief health officer
Dr John Carnie said. Dr Carnie and police believe the doctor
recklessly and maybe deliberately infected the women by using needles
he had contaminated. "The more cases you find in this instance, it
becomes more and more difficult to explain this by any other
accidental means," Dr Carnie told reporters on Monday [31 May 2010].
"We didn't find anything in the infection control procedures at that
clinic that would lead to an obvious reason for this."

Dr Peters, a widower and father of 2 teenage children, has a history
of drug abuse and received a suspended jail sentence in 1996 for
writing around 100 stolen pethidine prescriptions for himself and his
late wife. A special police unit, Taskforce Clays, has been set up to
specifically investigate Dr Peters.

A police source told AAP [Australian Associated Press] the case was
unprecedented in Victoria and, while charges could be laid, police
were frustrated by outdated legislation and would recommend to the
state government the law be improved. "We need to keep with the times
and have legislation that accommodates specific offences and current
issues," the source said. Detective Superintendent Gerry Ryan said the
case was "legally complicated", but he assured people that "any
criminal behaviour will be uncovered and appropriately dealt with."

Dr Peters was suspended by the Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria
(MPBV) in February [2010] and was in Melbourne, but could not be
contacted on Monday [31 May 2010]. Law firm Slater and Gordon is
representing 30 hepatitis C infected women who are demanding
compensation from the Croydon Day Surgery, Dr Peters and possibly the
MPBV for allowing him to practise unsupervised.

The Croydon clinic's owner, Dr Mark Jerry Schulberg, has also been in
trouble with the medical board twice in the past year; including a
reprimand for performing an abortion on an intellectually disabled
woman without consent and for inappropriately prescribing painkillers
and steroids.

The lawyer representing the women said while Dr Peters might not have
been acting "maliciously", he should have known better and the number
of affected women would "inevitably rise". "We are getting women come
forward daily, it's really concerning, they are young women with
plenty of time to get complications," she told AAP. "It was medically
reckless, he knew how blood borne diseases spread."

[Since the previous report of this incident in ProMED-mail on 20 Apr
2010 the number of confirmed cases of hepatitis C virus infection
among women treated at the Croydon Day Surgery in Melbourne has risen
from 12 to 44 and is still rising.

Transmission of hepatitis C virus infection in haemodialysisis and
similar units unfortunately has not been uncommon due to medical
negligence and faulty infection control procedures. However, the
incident at the Croydon Day Surgery in Melbourne is exceptional in
that infection control procedures at the Surgery have not been faulted
and the matter has become the subject of a police investigation.

The motivation of the physician responsible for this incident cannot
be speculated upon at this stage of the investigation, and may not be
revealed for some time in view of impending legal proceedings. Further
information is awaited.

[According to the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, 18th edn,
more than 90 percent of those infected are asymptomatic, but 50-80
percent of them will develop chronic infection and half of those will
develop liver cirrhosis or liver cancer over the next 20 years. The
infection is treatable with a combination of ribavirin and
slow-release interferon, but these have significant side effects. -
