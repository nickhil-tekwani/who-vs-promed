In your [CHC's response about stagnant swimming pools, you questioned
whether this was true [and why. Most of the eastern United States has
been suffering from drought conditions. The recent heavy rains from
Hurricane Dennis have only improved the situation slightly.
Until this week, we had drought emergency conditions in the
Virginia/Maryland/DC area which called for severe restrictions in the use
of water. One of these restrictions was a ban on topping out swimming
pools. When the water level gets too low, the recirculating pumps cannot
operate. Stagnant swimming pools were common in our area until the ban was
lifted this week. This may also be the case in the NYC area.

Neglected swimming pools in urban areas definitely can be a major source of
_Culex pipiens_ complex mosquitoes (the probable vectors of the SLE
outbreak in NY). Such mosquito production was a major problem in affluent
neighborhoods of Orange County, California, as far back as the early 1970's.

Most likely the _Aedes_ and _Anopheles_ are not important vectors of SLE
virus,
because they rarely feed on birds. More important is _Culex pipiens pipiens_,
the species probably responsible for [SLE virus transmission in New York.

What rain in NYC this summer? [Mea culpa. - Mod.CHC The tri-state area
has experienced one of the worst droughts on record. The trees along the
East river Drive, West Side Highway, Central Park are dying. New Jersey
has had water
restrictions in effect for a month now. It only rained (after 2-3 months
of NOT A DROP) 2 weeks ago when we had a monsoon and now again over the
last 4 days. We wish we had had rain this summer.

New York City has one of the least aggressive mosquito-control programs in
the region, with virtually no preventive maintenance and a budget that is
less than 6% of that in nearby Suffolk County, whose human population is
only one-fifth the size of New York's.
As City Health Department officials continued to distribute pesticides in
parts of the Bronx and Queens on Tuesday in response to last week's deadly
outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis, and to field thousands of worried phone
calls from residents, mosquito experts raised questions about whether New
York's war on the dangerous pests had come too late. They noted that the
species linked to the outbreak is particularly prevalent in urban areas.
Doctors at Flushing Hospital said they were worried that hundreds more
people in northern Queens might be infected, and said a third death might
be linked to the encephalitis.
Unlike suburban areas surrounding the city in Connecticut, New Jersey and
Long Island, New York does not routinely spray to kill mosquitoes, and does
not set traps to keep track of local mosquito populations, leaving city
officials without crucial information about viral patterns. When the
encephalitis was confirmed last week, the city had to call in experts from
Long Island and even borrow malathion, the pesticide sprayed over the
weekend, from Suffolk County's Department of Vector Control, the agency
that battles disease-spreading pests.
"They don't have much of a mosquito program -- I really don't know why
not," said Judy A. Hansen, president of the New Jersey Mosquito Control
Association and a past president of a parallel national group. "The best
form of mosquito control is preventive." Sandra Mullin, a spokeswoman for
the New York City Health Department, acknowledged that New York's is a
"complaint-driven program," and said the city had not been eligible for
state money to battle mosquitoes because it had not been hit with
mosquito-borne disease as often as other areas.
But Wayne J. Crans, director of Mosquito Research and Control at Rutgers
University, said it was just a matter of time before St. Louis encephalitis
hit New York. "The average person thinks the way you control mosquitoes is
you spray them," said Dr. Crans, one of the nation's leading mosquito
experts. "That's absolutely not true. Spraying is a last, last resort." New
York officials sprayed malathion from a helicopter again late Tuesday in
areas of the Bronx east of the Hutchinson River Parkway, but had not
expanded their area of concern to other parts of the city. They are still
awaiting the results of lab tests on 33 suspected cases, in addition to the
five cases already confirmed, which includes the two elderly residents of
Queens who died last month after contracting the virus.
Ms. Mullin said New York City's mosquito-control efforts had a budget of
$120 000 last year, with two full-time employees. (In summertime, two more
are borrowed from the pest-control division.) In contrast, Suffolk County
has 33 employees and a $2 million budget devoted to fighting mosquitoes.
Figures were not available yesterday for other nearby districts, but the
State of Connecticut and many counties in New Jersey have ongoing programs
of trapping and testing mosquitoes weekly, as well as directed spraying of
stagnant water to prevent infestations.
Los Angeles County, whose population is 9.2 million compared with New York
City's 7.4 million, has a vector-control program with a $6 million budget
and about 100 employees.
"In New York City, mosquitoes have been more of a nuisance as opposed to a
public health issue," Ms. Mullin said, adding that as a result, the city
has not been eligible for certain state mosquito-control money. In other
parts of New York State, she added, "there may be more of a reason to do
more aggressive spraying." The encephalitis outbreak, Ms. Mullin said,
"may very much well have an impact on the kinds of activities we look to
build in the future, since we're obviously quite concerned about the
situation now."
City officials said the main areas of concern remained in Queens, where the
five confirmed cases of infection were found, and the eastern edge of the
Bronx, where some patients have complained of symptoms. People in other
parts of the city and nearby Westchester County have no particular reason
to worry, experts said, because the type of mosquito that carries the
virus, _Culex pipiens_, typically flies less than a mile in its lifetime.
There could, however, be other mosquitoes in the city carrying the virus,
which the mosquitoes get from [feeding on infected birds.
"We're being very, very cautious here," said Andrew J. Spano, the County
Executive in Westchester, where officials are gathering samples of
mosquitoes and testing them for the virus. "We're not that far from New
York City, and mosquitoes don't know where borders are. Right now, spraying
in Westchester County would cause more problems than the mosquitoes do."
Although mosquitoes are generally found in wooded areas, the species that
carries St. Louis encephalitis [virus is an urban breed, flourishing in
polluted waters like storm drains and sewers, Dr. Crans said. This is the
first outbreak of the disease in New York City, but it has long plagued
other cities -- starting first in St. Louis in 1933, and later hitting
Chicago, Houston, various cities in Florida and Camden, N.J. There have
been more than 4000 confirmed cases in the United States since 1964. "We've
had outbreaks of this disease across the country for years and years and
years," Crans said. "It's just New York's turn. When you have people, you
have pollution. When you have pollution, you have this mosquito."
Doctors at Flushing Hospital, who have treated the two patients whose death
from encephalitis has been confirmed, as well as three others with the
virus and several more whose diagnosis is unconfirmed, said yesterday that
they notified the state's Department of Health Aug. 23 about a suspected
epidemic.

Health officials in Connecticut are testing mosquitoes for potentially
deadly St. Louis encephalitis after an outbreak in neighboring New York.
"Certainly, we are concerned," said Matthew Cartter, epidemiology program
coordinator for the state Department of Public Health. "This is the first
outbreak of the disease in the Northeast (in recent memory)." "If there is
evidence that the virus is in mosquitoes here, something will be started to
hinder them," said John Anderson, director of the Connecticut Agricultural
Experiment Station in New Haven.
Six mosquito traps were installed along the shoreline and inland sections
of Greenwich over the Labor Day weekend, and more will be set this week.
Traps were also set in Stamford. [n.b. - Greenwich and Stamford are two of
the wealthiest towns on the planet. - Mod CHC A total of 67 mosquitoes
were captured in Greenwich. Fourteen were _Culex_ mosquitoes, the breed
most commonly associated with the spread of SLE. It will be five or six
days before researchers know whether the mosquitoes are carrying St. Louis
encephalitis virus or Eastern equine encephalitis virus.
