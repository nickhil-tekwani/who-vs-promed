The Western Cape health department has vaccinated 15 500 students and children against measles in Stellenbosch and Drakenstein this month [February 2017] in an effort to prevent the spread of measles.

There are currently 9 confirmed cases of measles, and all patients have been treated and are recovering.

The department said it was acting in line with the World Health Organization's Outbreak Response Protocol, which advises mass vaccination to the affected areas and surrounds.

The department said a target of 80% coverage needed to be achieved to create immunity.

On Sun [19 Feb 2017] afternoon‚ 78% of coverage had already been achieved.

All available staff were deployed in these areas‚ visiting schools‚ crèches and even going door to door‚ irrespective of the heat.

The department said it was positive it would achieve the target of 80% by the end of Mon [20 Feb 2017]. Western Cape health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo thanked all the role-players involved in the outbreak response.

The department said when an outbreak was confirmed‚ the 1st action was to vaccinate all those who were closest to the point of the outbreak.

In this case‚ these were the learners attending the 3 high schools in Stellenbosch.

The 2nd phase was to vaccinate those situated just outside of the initial outbreak but who may be at risk of contracting the illness; these are children between 6 to 59 months who live in the Stellenbosch area. The 3rd measure is to vaccinate children attending primary schools in the affected areas.

The department said this process would start next week and included all 88 primary schools in the Drakenstein and Stellenbosch areas‚ with a total of 52 307 learners to be vaccinated.

A child infected with the measles was at Palmerston North City Library on the morning of 9 Feb [2017] and could have infected people there at that time.

A child infected with the measles has visited multiple public areas, potentially infecting others.

The child is the 7th confirmed measles case in Palmerston North. Six others, all part of the Institute of the Pacific United, were confirmed earlier this month [February 2017].

Classes at IPU have been cancelled until 20 Feb 2017.

Medial officer of health Dr Rob Weir said the latest case had no obvious connection to the IPU cases. "It is likely that the child has come into contact with one of the other cases in the community before the outbreak was reported, and the initial cases were placed in quarantine." ...more

"Measles spreads from person to person through the air from breathing, coughing and sneezing, and contact with those secretions.

"Even a short period of exposure may be enough for the disease to spread."

Children who had not had their scheduled measles, mumps and rubella vaccination at 15 months old would need to stay in isolation.

"Even the local park or swimming pool is off limits, as measles is highly infectious.

"We acknowledge that this will be a problem for some families, particularly for parents who work, but we re-emphasise that measles is a serious illness, particularly for those with lowered immunity."

Measles symptoms include a fever, runny nose, cough, and sore red eyes. After 3-5 days, a rash appears on the head and can spread down the body.
