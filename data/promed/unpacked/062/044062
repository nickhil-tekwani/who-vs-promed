HFRS situation remains tense in Udmurtia
----------------------------------------
According to the staff of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for
Consumer Affairs and Human Welfare] administration in Udmurtia the
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) situation remains
uncertain. The territory of Udmurtia is regarded as an optimal
environment for voles, which are the main reservoir of HFRS
infection. The epizootic situation in the forests of the Republic is
unstable. The vole population has expanded; the numbers fluctuate
between 21 and 60 percent [of the maximum recorded]. The mean rate of
infection among these rodents is 16.2 percent (whereas it was 18
percent in 2008). During the 1st 7 months of 2009 a total of 306
cases of HFRS was registered, 17 percent lower than during the same
period of 2008. In May (2009) the death of a 40-year-old man from
HFRS was reported in the city of Ijevsk.

HFRS has been recorded in 17 districts and 4 cities of Udmurtia
(Ijevsk, Mojga, Sarapul, Votkinsk). 10 cases have been recorded in
patients younger than 14 years of age, which is 1.2 times more than
in 2008. Mostly residents in rural areas have been affected; the
incidence among them is 1.3 times higher than it was in 2008. In
contrast, the incidence among city residents this year [2009]
decreased 1.5 times. The analysis of cases shows that the infection
occurs mainly in forested areas, and occasionally in gardens. The
forecast for this infection is not favorable. An increased morbidity
is expected during the summer-autumn period due to expansion of the
rodent population. Because the peak morbidity is expected during July
and August, it is recommended that appropriate precautions be taken
during agricultural operations, and also by those participating in
recreational visits to forested areas.
