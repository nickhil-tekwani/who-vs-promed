The Cabinet [of the Malaysian government wants all pigs to be vaccinated
to curb the spread of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in the country, Health
Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said today. He said the Veterinary Services
Department had been directed to advise pig farmers on the proper way to
carry out the job.
The Cabinet which discussed the JE outbreak at today's meeting wanted the
relevant authorities and parties involved to discharge their
responsibilities fully, he told a news conference after attending the
Cabinet meeting. Chua said the Health Department would enforce the law
empowered under the Destruction of Disease Bearing and Insects Act to
ensure that the farmers protect their lives and those under their care.
"The Veterinary Services Department must also ensure that the farmers
implement good farming practices with proper sanitation," he said.
A total of 28 JE-related deaths had been reported from October last year to
yesterday with 15 deaths in Kinta, Perak and 13 in Sikamat and Bukit
Pelandok, Negri Sembilan.
