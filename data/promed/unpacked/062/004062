More blind alligators found on coast, with a similar disturbing trait
------------------------------------
Two more blind alligators, both phoned in as "nuisance" alligators by local
residents, have been recovered in Ocean Springs, Alabama, bringing the
number of blind alligators trapped between Ocean Springs and Mobile Bay in
the last year to 54.
Speculation by researchers and trappers regarding the affliction ranges
from parasites and disease to an increased exposure to saltwater and
possible chemical contamination. But so far, little is known.
Trapper and river guide Lynn McCoy, who has trapped all 4 of the blind
Mississippi alligators -- 2 of them off the Ocean Springs beach, the other
2 from in-town -- said he is concerned that whatever is to blame may have
been responsible for the dozen or more pelican deaths that occurred in that
area in January. "When everything's happening in one area, you've got to
check out what's happening in that area," he said.
Although toxicology reports are still pending with US Fish and Wildlife,
Missy Dubuisson, vice president of Wildlife Care and Rescue Center, a
nonprofit group specializing in rescuing animals in distress, said there is
no connection. "There is no way, shape or form they could be connected,"
she said. A call to US Fish and Wildlife in Jackson was not returned on Monday.
McCoy has trapped the 4 blind alligators in Ocean Springs in the past 2
months. But the most recent pair, trapped just before the July 4 weekend,
share an unusual trait: both have a small cavity eaten away through the
flesh and bone between their eyes. "That's just not right for it to be in
the same spot in 2 skulls," McCoy said. McCoy said he is holding one
specimen, whose left eye is completely eaten away and whose right is badly
damaged, for study at the University of Alabama. Blind alligators aren't
just a risk to themselves. McCoy said the disoriented or injured animals
are more likely to show up in areas inhabited by people, leading to a
greater chance of confrontation.
