In December 2006, the National Citrus Canker Eradication Program (NCCEP)
completed its 4th quarterly round of host plant regrowth and native citrus
surveys in the Emerald Pest Quarantine Area (PQA). No citrus canker was
detected and the disease has not been detected in the PQA since May 2005.
The program is currently 12 months into an 18 month "host-free" period in
the PQA, during which the disease is expected to die out due to the absence
of live hosts in the area. Surveys are being conducted every 90 days during
the host-free period for host plant regrowth and on native citrus in
identified high-risk zones around Emerald's destroyed citrus orchards.
If there are no further detections of citrus canker between now and
completion of the host-free period in June 2007, Emerald's commercial
citrus growers will be allowed to start replanting their orchards.
The replanted orchards will be subject to a further 18 months of intensive
surveillance leading up to the planned declaration of eradication in early
2009.
Domestic citrus and other ornamental host plants will not be permitted to
be replanted in the PQA until after eradication is declared. For more
information, see the National Citrus Canker Eradication Program webpage,
noted above.

[2] New growth and new future for Emerald citrus � replanting to start

After almost 3 years of fighting to rid Queensland from citrus canker, the
Emerald citrus industry is preparing to replant orchards. Minister for
Primary Industries and Fisheries, Tim Mulherin, today [1 Mar 2007] gave
growers the green light to replant commercial citrus orchards in Emerald as
of 1 Jul 2007. The announcement follows amendments to the Plant Protection
Regulation, which according to the minister, are the next important step in
rebuilding a stable, sustainable and canker-free industry in Queensland.
"Since the disease was first detected in Emerald in June 2004, the
Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI&F) and its national
cost-sharing partners have invested millions of dollars in the National
Citrus Canker Eradication Program," Mr Mulherin said.
He continued, "Most recently, the program�s efforts have focussed on
maintaining a 'host-free' period and undertaking painstaking surveillance
and research in the Emerald Pest Quarantine Area (PQA) to provide the
highest level of confidence that the area is free of the disease before
replanting commences. DPI&F officers have spoken with each of Emerald�s
commercial citrus growers, and explained the new regulations. Everyone
agrees that this is a positive step for Emerald, and for DPI&F�s continued
commitment to eradicate citrus canker in Queensland."
Mr Mulherin said surveillance of host plants in the PQA would continue,
with stringent inspections of the replanted orchards to be undertaken every
90 days for a further 18 months after replanting. "If no citrus canker is
detected during this period, eradication will be declared in early 2009,"
he said. "After nearly three years of blood, sweat and tears in Emerald,
everyone wants to ensure the local citrus industry is free from this
disease, which is why the Department is maintaining extensive surveillance
activities and tough movement controls on host plants and fruit until
eradication is declared."
Only commercial citrus trees will be allowed to be planted in the PQA next
year, with backyard replanting expected to be permitted only after
eradication is officially declared.

[Citrus canker is caused by the Gram negative bacterium _Xanthomonas
axonopodis_ pathovar _citri_. Symptoms appear on fruit, leaves and branches
of infected plants. The disease most likely originated in south-east Asia
and has spread worldwide. It can be transmitted by mechanical means, water,
or insects within groves while long-distance spread is mostly by infected
plant material. It affects commercial citrus varieties and other members of
the family _Rutaceae_ posing a serious economic threat to citrus industries.
The Australian story is a good example of a coordinated quarantine response
programme of vigilance and suppression which appears to have a very good
chance of eventually resulting in disease eradication. In the US,
eradication was recently declared not to be feasible (see:

Citrus Canker Eradication Not Feasible')
