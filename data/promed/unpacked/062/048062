During the 1st stage of the Q-fever outbreak in the Netherlands, many
of those involved sat on the fence for too long, expecting the problem
would go away by itself. Because the disease was concentrated in the
Noord-Brabant area, it was regarded as a regional problem. And at
regional level there were deficiencies in duty assignments for
thorough measures to be undertaken.

These are some of the conclusions of the investigation ordered by the
Provincial Council for Public Health in Noord-Brabant. The report was
presented today [29 Sep 2010].

The outbreak, which started in 2006 in the village of Herpen, turned
into an epidemic of more than 2000 human cases in 2009, regarded the
largest ever anywhere in the world. At least 12 people died. In 2009,
panic and social anxiety eventually got to levels causing a clear need
for measures to be taken. However, says the researcher Mirte Post, at
this stage the Mexican flu [H1N1] scare drew all the government's
attention and Q-fever remained in the background.

Also, the collaboration between the 2 ministries (Agriculture and
Public Health) could have been better. Killing the goats would
probably not have been necessary if the measures had been applied more
adequately. The advice about animal vaccination and the purchase of
vaccine were delayed too long, according to Post.

The provincial Council for Public Health emphasises that Brabant
[Province] was not prepared for a Q-fever outbreak and supports the
recommendation for special care for patients with long-term fatigue
complaints. Post recommends province and government to make a decision
regarding compensation to the patients.

The evaluation report on lessons to be learnt, ordered by the 2
ministries (agriculture and public-health) from the investigation
committee headed by the agroeconomist Prof Van Dijk (Commission van
Dijk), is due to be presented on 22 Nov 2010.
