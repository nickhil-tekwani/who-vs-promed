A 58-year-old man staying at a campground for military personnel
[near Colorado Springs, in central Colorado] contracted hantavirus
and died this week, Air Force Academy and state health officials said
Friday [21 Jul 2006].
The man died Wednesday [19 Jul 2006] of the disease that is passed to
humans when they inhale particles of dried urine or feces from
infected rodents, officials said. He and his wife had been staying at
the Peregrine Pines FamCamp, located in a wooded area between the
academy's Falcon Stadium and Interstate 25, for several months.
"He was ill for about 4 days with fever and aches and over the
weekend started developing some respiratory involvement," said John
Pape an epidemiologist with the Colorado Department of Public Health
and Environment. There is no drug treatment for hantavirus. He began
experiencing symptoms 11 Jul [2006]. Hantavirus is marked by fever,
headache and muscle ache, possibly with chills, nausea and vomiting,
and progresses rapidly to severe difficulty in breathing and, in some
cases, death. Symptoms develop one to 6 weeks after exposure.
Dr. Chris Benjamin, deputy hospital commander at the academy, said he
believes the man contracted the virus after cleaning a confined space
underneath his RV or trailer.
Academy officials inspected the campground and others for evidence of
rodent droppings and have no plans to close the campground.
The disease was 1st identified in the Four Corners area in 1993, when
18 people got sick and 10 died. The outbreak led to the
identification of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. There have been 48
cases in Colorado between 1993 and 2005 and fewer than 450 cases have
been recorded nationwide, Pape said. One woman died from the disease
in 2005 in Douglas County, while a Saguache County man died from the
virus in 2004.
It is not passed between humans.
