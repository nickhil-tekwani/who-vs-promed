Anthrax alert in Uasin Gishu
----------------------------
Alarm has been raised over an anthrax outbreak after 4 cows in Kong'asis village [Uasin Gishu county] died on Sunday [6 Sep 2015]. Veterinary officers were yesterday [9 Sep 2015] dispatched to the area to do a ring vaccination exercise.

The director of livestock at the Eldoret-based Regional Veterinary Investigation Laboratory, Dr Joseph Njuguna, said the animals have been buried and the area disinfected with lime to prevent further spread of the disease.

The reporting of anthrax in Kenya is improving each year. Anthrax has never been absent. In 2014, 9 bovine outbreaks were reported for the Rift Valley province with 47 cases. In that same year, there were 134 human anthrax cases reported nationally, and though no deaths were officially reported, our reports for Kenya that year listed some 7 deaths reported in the local press. "Disinfecting" with lime has the opposite result as anthrax spores survive most efficiently in a high-calcium, high pH environment. Quick lime might have been of use at one time when disposing of carcasses, but the only lime available these days is agricultural lime. It just does the reverse. Burn every anthrax carcass. - Mod.MHJ
