Italian authorities are investigating a _Listeria_ outbreak that has sickened 22 people and killed one. Mortadella sold by Veroni is being looked at as a potential source, but an official link has not been confirmed by authorities. In early November [2022], a number of recalls were published for Veroni mortadella due to potential _Listeria_ contamination.

The Ministry of Health (Ministero della Salute) issued a warning covering a few batches of the Veroni Supergiant Mortadella packed in small portions due to the presence of _Listeria monocytogenes_. Veroni said it immediately and voluntarily alerted the market, recalling all batches of Supergiant Mortadella with and without pistachios in portions that had expiry dates before 27 Dec 2022.

In a statement to Food Safety News, Veroni said it had not yet been informed of any ongoing investigation and the issue doesn't affect products sent to the United States. "The cured meats imported in the United States by Veroni are manufactured in a dedicated facility based in the Emilia-Romagna region that serves only North America. Before being shipped, these products are subjected to high-pressure processing (HPP) treatment, leading to the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms and enzymes in the food. In particular, the ready-to-be-sliced mortadella shipped in the United States is cooked at high temperatures and encased into artificial casings to prevent environmental contamination.

"In addition, all the products imported to the United States by Veroni are subjected to USDA inspection. Once delivered to Veroni's NJ-based facility, the cured meats are sliced and packed following strict food safety and hygiene procedures. Daily inspections are conducted to minimize potential food safety risks and mitigate any problems. All Veroni's facilities in Italy and the United States were inspected, further sanitized, and checked by government veterinarians: they are all working and safe."

The latest outbreak is caused by a different type of _Listeria_ than the one that has sickened at least 90 people and killed 3 since 2021.

Investigations previously revealed a connection between patients and the presence of _Listeria_ in sausages made with poultry meat produced by Agricola Tre Valli, after sampling at the plant in Verona. _Listeria_ was also detected during environmental sampling at the factory. Authorities have identified the same type of _Listeria_ in some patients and recalled products.

AIA Wudy and Pavo brands have been recalled, but they were distributed to 30 countries mostly across Europe, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.

There are sporadic cases in other countries but the major burden is in Italy, where recalls and investigations have been undertaken, said the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

[The November 2022 listeriosis outbreak in Italy that has sickened 22 people and killed one, in which the ready-to-eat deli meat mortadella sold by Veroni is thought to be the source, is said in the news report above to be different from a prior listeriosis outbreak in Italy that was also linked to ready-to-eat deli meat. Mortadella is a large Italian sausage made of finely hashed or ground heat-cured pork, which incorporates at least 15% small cubes of pork fat, flavored with black pepper grains and pistachios (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortadella).

In the prior listeriosis outbreak in Italy, ProMED first posted a report in September 2022 that _Listeria_ was detected in several packages of Wudy and Pavo brands of sausages manufactured in Italy and distributed in Spain (ProMED post Listeriosis - Europe (04): Spain ex Italy, sausage, recall, alert, RFI 20220927.8705806). _Listeria_ was detected in environmental sampling carried out at the Agricola Tre Valli manufacturing facility in Verona, Italy. As a precautionary measure, all the products manufactured in this facility were withdrawn, as they are considered potentially affected (Wudy and Pavo brands). Subsequently, ProMED posted a report that at least 90 people had been affected in Italy and 3 died in multiple regions of Italy, and one woman lost her baby in this outbreak (Listeriosis - Europe (08): (Italy) fatal, sausage, recall, RFI 20221103.8706538). - Mod.ML
