Public health officials are warning about an outbreak of the intestinal illness [cyclosporiasis], with 83 cases being investigated across Canada. The Public Health Agency of Canada has issued a statement that says 2 people have been hospitalized from the parasite but no deaths have been reported.

The cases became known between 9 May and 18 Jul 2015 and are mainly in Ontario, but there are also some infections in British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec. The agency says the source is unknown but past outbreaks of [cyclosporiasis] have been linked to various types of imported fresh produce, such as pre-packaged salad mix, basil, cilantro, berries, mesclun lettuce and snow peas.

[Cyclosporiasis] is generally low-risk and can be cured with antibiotics, but people with weakened immune systems, children and the elderly are at increased risk of developing complications. Symptoms can include stomach cramps, diarrhea and loss of appetite. People are being asked to take extra care to clean and properly store fruits and vegetables.

[The source of the outbreak is not known. It is therefore too early to determine whether this outbreak is linked to the present outbreak of cyclosporiasis in the United Stated (see list of ProMED-mail reports below). The outbreaks could be linked if -- for instance -- lettuce were distributed in both the US and Canada by the same supplier. - Mod.EP
