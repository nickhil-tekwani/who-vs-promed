[According to the OIE WAHID database the only country in Europe
consistently reporting Dourine is Russia. All other countries appear
to be free of the disease. The last report from Italy is 1996.

Dourine is a venereal disease of horses, mules and donkeys caused by
_Trypanosoma equiperidium_. The Center for Food Safety and Public
Health, Iowa State University, provides a good overview from which I
have quoted the most relevant bits. See
http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/dourine.pdf.

Dourine is a serious, often chronic, venereal disease of horses and
other equids. This protozoal infection can result in neurological
signs and emaciation, and the mortality rates are high. No vaccine is
available, and treatment with drugs may result in inapparent
carriers.

Dourine was once widespread, but it has been eradicated from many
countries. Currently, the disease is endemic in parts of Africa and
parts of Asia including Russia. Outbreaks or cases are occasionally
reported from other areas including the Middle East and Europe.
Dourine may exist in some areas where testing is not done.

Dourine is characterized mainly by swelling of the genitalia,
cutaneous plaques and neurological signs. The symptoms vary with the
virulence of the strain, the nutritional status of the horse, and
stress factors. The clinical signs often develop over weeks or months.
They frequently wax and wane; relapses may be precipitated by stress.
This can occur several times before the animal either dies or
experiences an apparent recovery. - Mod.PC
