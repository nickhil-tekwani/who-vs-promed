As of 20 Nov 2007 nearly 100 people have died of suspected Rift Valley
fever with over 360 more infected, Sudan officials said on Tuesday [20 Nov
2007], after initially being slow to confirm an outbreak of the deadly disease.

The Health Ministry said 94 people had died and 362 been infected in the
suspected outbreak concentrated in White Nile, Sinnar, and Al-Jazira
states, south of Khartoum. Ministry epidemiologist Issam Mohammed Abdallah
released the figures in a meeting with health officials, the official SUNA
news agency reported. Abdallah said the disease could be transmitted by
eating uncooked meat, drinking unpasteurised milk, or close proximity to
infected animals. Fear of contracting the disease has caused a significant
decline in meat consumption, the Khartoum press reported.

On 9 Nov 2007, the World Health Organization (WHO) said more than 80 people
had died of suspected Rift Valley fever and that more than 25 of almost 230
suspected cases in Sudan had been confirmed by laboratory analysis. There
are no vaccines for humans who contract Rift Valley fever, usually via
mosquitoes. Victims usually experience fever, general weakness, back pain,
dizziness, vomiting of blood, and extreme weight loss at the onset of the
illness. Many patients recover within a week but others can die, including
those with weakened immune systems, experts say.

The fever was 1st isolated in Kenya's Rift Valley region in 1930s but has
since been recorded elsewhere on the continent and overseas.

[According to this report the number of cases has increased by 33 since the
statement issued by WHO on 14 Nov 2007. The number of fatalities, however,
has been reduced by 2. - Mod.CP

The animal health aspects of this epidemic are rather poorly covered; see
Sudan's report to the OIE (Office International des Epizooties; World
Organisation for Animal Health), dated 11 Nov 2007, and Mod PC's commentary
in ProMED-mail 20071114.3694). From a subscriber's response we note that no
information is available on limitations concerning exports of livestock
from Sudan, including to the Arab peninsula. A newspaper in Yemen cited an
official expressing concern on the possible introduction of Rift Valley
fever; see "Yemen unable to combat bird flu and Rift Valley fever, report
says" at <http://yementimes.com/article.shtml?i=1104&p=front&a=2>. - Mod.AS]
