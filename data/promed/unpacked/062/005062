A "red tide" proliferation of toxic algae has led to the poisoning of 51
people in Costa Rica and has spread to Guatemala and El Salvador, officials
said.
According to Mario Gonzalez, the regional coordinator of the Central
American Fishing Development Program (INCOPESCA), the phenomenon, which
appeared in December 2000 on Costa Rica's Pacific coast, has appeared
recently along the Guatemalan and Salvadoran coasts.
The red tide is caused by changes in the salinity, temperature, or
nutrients in the water, leading to the rapid reproduction of a type of
algae producing toxins affecting mollusks. Toxins in the algae are not
eliminated by mollusks, and can infect [intoxicate humans who eat these
bivalves, possibly causing paralysis and even death. Experts in Costa Rica
have warned that red tide is currently affecting the country's Pacific
coast, and the mollusks in the region are showing "dangerous levels of toxins."
Since December 2000, 51 cases of infections [illness in humans have been
reported in Costa Rica.
