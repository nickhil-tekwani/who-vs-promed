Incidence of [New Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in Children in the UK
-------------------------------------------
The identification of 3 childhood cases of [new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (vCJD) in the United Kingdom was reported in the British Paediatric
Surveillance Unit's annual report, recently summarised in Eurosurveillance
Weekly (Handysides S. Active surveillance of rare and serious diseases in
children. Eurosurveillance Weekly 2000; 4: 000928
<http://www.eurosurv.org/2000/000928.htm>.
Full details of the study, in which paediatricians throughout the UK report
all cases of progressive intellectual and neurological deterioration (PIND)
in children to investigators who follow them up, have now been published in
the Lancet (Verity CM, Nicoll A, Will RG, Devereux G, Stellitano L. Variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in UK children: a national surveillance study.
Lancet 2000; 356: 1224-7). The active surveillance scheme is intended to
ensure that all cases of childhood vCJD are ascertained, and the authors are
reassured that only 3 cases out of 655 discussed have vCJD.
Nevertheless, they note that the 3 cases were all reported in the most
recent of the 3 years of surveillance, and express concern that further
childhood cases may appear.
