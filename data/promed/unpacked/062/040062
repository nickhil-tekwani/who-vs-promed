Authorities in Finland are investigating a number of suspected _E. coli_ outbreaks in recent months to see if they are connected. The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) has received 9 reports of suspected Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ [also called enterohemorrhagic EC] alerts from across Finland from June to August [2021]. In 5 of these reports, patients are infected with _E. coli_ O103. In this period, 45 cases of E. coli O103 have been detected by the THL laboratory. Serotyping of another 22 strains is ongoing.

Investigations to find potential sources of infection to connect the patients are continuing with local authorities and the Finnish Food Authority (Ruokavirasto). This work includes interviewing sick people, sequencing patient samples and tracing the foods identified in the interviews.

Since 2016, an average of 200 _E. coli_ infections have been reported to the Infectious Diseases Register each year. More than half of these come from abroad. _E. coli_ O103 is one of the most common types of the pathogen found in patients in Finland. It has previously been detected in cattle and raw milk and caused an outbreak in 2014 traced to contaminated water. None of the _E. coli_ O103 patients from 2001 to 2020 interviewed in Finland were diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which can lead to kidney failure.

[It is yet unclear how many of the total EHEC isolates are O103 and if they are closely related genetically. In the initial post (20210814.8593582), ground beef was implicated in some of the cases as the vehicle.

In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (1). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (2), the former serotype being the implicated strain in this outbreak.

ProMED has previously reported on outbreaks of this serotype spread by bean sprouts, ground beef, ground bison and unpasteurized dairy.
