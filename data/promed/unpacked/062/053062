At least 156 Filipinos have died of leptospirosis this year [2022] so far, the Department of Health (DOH) said on Tuesday [9 Aug 2022]. In a press briefing, DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said that a total of 1178 leptospirosis cases have been recorded in 2022, of which 165 cases were detected in the period from [26 June 2022] to [23 Jul 2022].

The DOH OIC said that the regions that have recorded the most leptospirosis cases in this most recent period were the National Capital Region (NCR), Cagayan Valley, and Central Luzon.

Leptospirosis is a potentially fatal bacterial disease that affects humans and animals alike. It is caused by the spiral-shaped _Leptospira_ bacteria, which can be transmitted to humans through exposure to the urine of infected animals or water or soil that has been contaminated by infected animal urine.

Floods can potentially increase the transmission of the disease. "We know that every time there is a rainy season, it floods, and the public becomes more vulnerable to the illness," Vergeire said. Vergeire earlier urged the public to take precautions when wading through floodwaters: to wear boots, wash their feet after contact with floodwater, and to get checked by a healthcare professional in case of symptoms.

Health authorities have recorded 11 fatalities due to leptospirosis in Bicol region from [1 Jan 2022] to [30 Jul 2022]. Based on data released by the Department of Health Center for Health Development (DOH-CHD) Bicol Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit, 3 patients who died of the rodent-borne disease were from Albay province, 2 were from Camarines Norte, 2 from Catanduanes, 1 from Camarines Sur, and 3 from Sorsogon province.

There were also 85 cases of the disease covering the same period in the entire region. Dr. Rosa Maria Rempillo, local health support division chief of DOH-CHD in Bicol, told Inquirer in a text message on Tuesday [9 Aug 2022], that there was a 3% decrease of leptospirosis incidence in Bicol this year [2022] compared to 2021 when 88 cases were recorded.

"In order not to get infected with the deadly disease, avoid submerging in flood waters particularly if the person has an open wound," Rempillo said. Leptospirosis is a rare bacterial infection that is spread through the urine of animals, especially dogs, rodents, and farm animals.

In most cases, leptospirosis is unpleasant but not life-threatening.

[As of 2019, the Philippines is divided into 17 regions (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/PH_Administrative_Map.svg). Bicol is an administrative region of the Philippines, designated as Region V, which consists of 6 provinces: 4 on the Bicol Peninsula mainland (the southeastern end of Luzon) -- Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, and Sorsogon -- plus the offshore island provinces of Catanduanes and Masbate. The regional center is Legazpi City (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicol_Region).
