The missing 100th case: Dakahlia Governorate
--------------------------------------------
A boy, age 10 years, began to exhibit symptoms on 10 Feb 2010. He was
referred to EL Bakry Hospital-Cairo in moderate condition. Tamiflu
(oseltamivir) treatment was started on 14 Feb 2010. Infection with HPAI
[highly pathogenic avian influenza -- that is, avian influenza (H5N1) virus
infection] was confirmed on 17 Feb 2010. The Ministry of Health (MOH)
reported this was case number 100 of highly pathogenic avian influenza in
Egypt. (Source of report: Egyptian MOH).

ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall

[Previously the Egyptian Ministry of Health had omitted to identify the
100th case. This report rectifies that omission.

Some confusion remains, however. The SAIDR report above (text not shown)
identifies the 30 year old woman in Kafr El Sheikh governorate as the 101st
case, and a 13 year old boy in the same governorate as the 102nd case,
whereas the previous Ministry of Health report (see: Avian influenza, human
(15): Egypt, 101st & 102nd cases 20100220.0584) identifies the boy as the
101st case and the woman as the 102nd case. None of these cases has been fatal.
