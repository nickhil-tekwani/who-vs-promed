All mainland chicken imports to Hong Kong were stopped at midnight amid
fears the bird flu [influenzavirus A H5N1 had killed a fourth victim. A
60-year-old woman died last night hours after being listed as the 12th
possible H5N1 case. Nine people have been confirmed as having the disease
and two [other children are believed to be infected. The woman was
unrelated to any of the others. Beijing's Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Relations ordered the temporary ban on poultry exports until a
proper inspection system for birds could be introduced, the Agriculture and
Fisheries Department said. It was hoped the cross-border monitoring system
would boost confidence in the local chicken market, which has seen sales
plummet more than 60%.
Deputy Director of Health Dr Paul Saw Thian-aun said there were no
confirmed mainland cases.
CDPC Note: With such close and detailed news reports and headlines for each
case and death, it is hard to convince the public and policy makers that,
although this "bird flu" problem may turn out to be a very large public
health problem, the current epidemiological findings to date suggests that
this H5N1 virus is not very communicable from chickens to humans and/or
from person-to-person. It is because the Hong Kong Department of Health
has a good virus laboratory that this problem was detected. Without that
initial virus isolate, all of the subsequent cases would not have been
found and the current public health panic over infected chickens would not
have occurred and all of the CDC and WHO investigators could have enjoyed a
quiet Christmas season in Atlanta and Geneva. Regardless of the eventual
outcome, the community studies being carried out will provide very useful
information to better understand the complex epidemiology of influenza
viruses.
