A Lake Forest man died recently after eating peanut butter from a
batch that has since been recalled. The remaining peanut butter from
the jar is being tested to see if it is contaminated with salmonella
bacteria. The 77-year-old man [ate a piece of toast spread with]
Peter Pan peanut butter on 30 Jan 2007.
"Within 6 hours of eating the sandwich, he began exhibiting symptoms
consistent with salmonella poisoning, including diarrhea, vomiting
and fever," said a spokesman for the family, "That led to his
pulmonary arrest on 2 Feb 2007."
The man had been undergoing treatment for cancer and his immune
system was compromised.
"There appears a reasonable probability that he died from salmonella
poisoning," the spokesman added. "To confirm that, we need tests done
by an independent lab." The remains of the peanut butter jar will be
tested for salmonella contamination.
There is a complication. The man "was cremated before his family knew
there was a connection with the peanut butter," the spokesman said.
"After they read about it in a newspaper, they checked the peanut jar
lid and saw the "2111" code."

A death has now been linked to the peanut butter Salmonella outbreak
that has made hundreds sick across the country.
A 76-year-old woman died in January 2007 from complications arising
from the [illness caused by the contaminated] peanut butter she ate.
The family's spokesman says the woman and her husband both got very
sick, but the wife never recovered.
Pierce says the daughter made the connection [with the peanut
butter.] She called her family up, had the jars checked and in fact
there were 2 jars of peanut butter with this particular code ["2111"]
in their home. All 3 family members had consumed it.

[As yet, neither of these deaths has been formally attributed to the
outbreak by CDC. Both deaths were in elderly individuals, a high-risk
group for complications from salmonellosis. In addition, one
individual was receiving cancer chemotherapy. In the 1st case, the
deceased was not cultured prior to cremation but the product is
available for testing. Whether the 2nd individual who died had
cultures is not directly stated. - Mod.LL]
