Lassa fever kills 7 in Taraba
-----------------------
Seven people have reportedly died in Taraba State, following an outbreak of Lassa fever a couple of days ago. The state Commissioner for Health, Prince Mustapha Hamman Gabdo, confirmed this while briefing journalists in the state. The commissioner said 4 of the victims of the disease died at the Federal Medical Centre, Jalingo, one died at the Government House Clinic, Jalingo, and the 2 others, who contracted the disease in Taraba State died in Gombe State after travelling there for treatment. He said the ministry had already taken measures to stop the spread of the epidemic and would embark on sensitisation campaigns as well as vaccinate the entire people of the state against the disease.

Shedding more light on the source of the dreaded fever and its dangers to human beings, the head of Epidemiology unit in the state Ministry of Health, Innocent Vakai, said the disease was transmitted by a specific rat which had no hair on its tail [The multimamate rat -- _Mastonomys_]. The Epidemiologist said the symptoms of Lassa Fever included severe headache, high fever, vomiting that passed through all the openings in the human body, just as he advised persons having such symptoms to rush to the nearest hospital for medical attention.

Similary, the Taraba State House of Assembly, on Thursday [9 Feb 2012], summoned an urgent public importance sitting, following reported cases of outbreak of Lassa fever in Jalingo, the state capital.

The Member representing Gembu Constituency, Honorable Abubakar Jugidda, who disclosed this before the assembly, stressed the need for the state government to look into the issue immediately to control the epidemic to save lives. The law maker urged the house to impress on the state government to direct the Ministry of Health to provide the necessary drugs to the victims of the disease. He also advised the house to embark on an enlightenment campaign to educate the people of the danger of the diseases and ways of preventing same. Other members who commented on the issue, seconded the motion describing the disease as a dangerious thing to mankind that needed urgent attention.

Members, Mark Useni, Josiah Sabo Kente and Abubakar Lawal regretted the alarming rate the disease was claiming lives within and outside the state and urged the state government to take proactive step to address the issue.

[Lassa virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus family _Arenaviridae_. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and parts of Nigeria, but probably exists in other West African countries as well. This is the 1st recent report of Lassa fever in Taraba state. So far 2 other outbreaks of Lassa fever been reported in Rivers state and Ebonyi state, also in southern of Nigeria.

About 80 percent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining cases have severe multi-system disease, where the virus affects several organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen and kidneys. Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease. The animal reservoir of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the "multimammate rat". _Mastomys_ infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their excreta.

Lassa fever occurs in all age groups and in both men and women. Persons at greatest risk are those living in rural areas where Mastomys are usually found, especially in areas of poor sanitation or crowded living conditions. Health care workers are at risk if proper barrier nursing and infection control practices are not maintained. Because the symptoms of Lassa fever are so varied and non-specific, clinical diagnosis is often difficult, especially early in the course of the disease. Lassa fever is difficult to distinguish from many other diseases which cause fever, including malaria, shigellosis, typhoid fever, yellow fever and other viral haemorrhagic fevers. Contrary to the statement in the above press report, no vaccine is available present.
