Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) livestock inspectors discovered fever ticks on cattle originating from a Webb County premises during a routine voluntary inspection at a program dipping vat on 23 Apr 2019. The premises where the cattle originated has been placed under quarantine, and all cattle on the premises have started treatment.

"We are thankful for cattle producers' support in voluntarily inspecting their animals for fever ticks," said Dr. Andy Schwartz, TAHC Executive Director. "Due to their actions, the newly discovered premises was identified quickly and treatment began promptly."

As a result of the quarantine, a Control Purpose Quarantine Area (CPQA) was established for systematic inspection of livestock and wildlife hosts in a portion of Eastern Webb County surrounding the infested premises. Consequently, cattle fever ticks have been discovered on 3 additional premises in the area, to date. The infested premises are located approximately 24 miles outside of the Permanent Fever Tick Quarantine Zone.

Producers located in the identified CPQA are being contacted by US Department of Agriculture, Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program personnel. Livestock on the premises located within the CPQA are subject to movement restrictions, systematic inspections and potential treatment in accordance with the regulations in Title 4, Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 41 Fever Ticks.

At present, there are approximately 744 566 acres under various types of fever tick quarantine outside of the Permanent Quarantine Zone. To learn more about the quarantine areas, visit http://www.tahc.texas.gov/animal_health/cattle/#ticks.

"An epidemiological investigation to determine the source of the fever ticks and trace outs from the premises is underway," said Dr. Schwartz. "We strive to protect the health and marketability of all Texas livestock and through the partnership with USDA-CFTEP and our stakeholders, we look to quickly eliminate fever ticks from the new CPQA and halt the spread of the pest."

Cattle Fever ticks, known scientifically as _Rhipicephalus_ (formerly _Boophilus_) _annulatus_ and _Rhipicephalus microplus_, are a significant threat to the US cattle industry. These ticks are capable of carrying the protozoa, or microscopic parasites, _Babesia bovis_ or _Babesia bigemina_, which cause the disease commonly known as cattle fever. The _Babesia_ organism attacks and destroys red blood cells, causing acute anemia, high fever, and enlargement of the spleen and liver, ultimately resulting in death for up to 90% of susceptible naive cattle.

[This tick is a huge economic concern for all the South Texas counties. It represents suffering for the affected animals as well as a tremendous economic loss for the producers. The counties affected in Texas are large counties and represent a tremendous amount of territory.

The ticks found outside the quarantine zone is disturbing. It means the tick range has expanded, which brings more worry to producers and suffering to animals and producers who suffer loss of production and sick animals.

The Texas cattle fever tick represents a great loss to Texas. The recent spread of these ticks is concerning because of disease spread, quarantines, and loss of animals and finances to the owner. This particular fever tick has plagued Texas for some time and was part of the history of Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine (http://vetmed.tamu.edu/about-us/history). Great strides were made against this pest. Then it rallied against the efforts to eliminate it from Texas.

It is a very expensive and time-consuming task to eradicate the carrier of this disease. In the 1940s, cattle were dipped in large vats with an arsenic-containing dip. Co-Ral is not an arsenic dip, but rather an organophosphate, which can inhibit cholinesterase. This chemical is a restricted-use pesticide, meaning special training and handling are required to use it.
