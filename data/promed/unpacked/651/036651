About a dozen children have fallen ill and tested positive for
Giardia, a waterborne intestinal parasite that causes diarrhea and
painful bloating. The kids all at the spraying-jet fountain at the
park on Tanya King Boulevard, Orange County.
Alarmed by the number of Giardia infection reports from local
pediatricians, Orange County Health Department inspectors checked the
fountain, which sprays children when they step on it, 2 weeks ago. It
has been closed since then, after inspectors found it had no
chlorine, was filthy with algae and was not draining properly,
reports show. It also had the wrong kind of chlorine pump.
Bill Toth, who heads the epidemiology division at the county Health
Department, said further investigation is needed to establish a
definitive link between the water and the cases of giardiasis, or
Giardia infection. He said testing the water for the parasite is not
practical; it would require a costly and lengthy process of filtering
thousands of gallons. "But those children that have Giardia have been
linked to the fountain," he said. This is the 3rd time in 10 months
that the fountain has been shut down because of maintenance problems.
Toth recommended that parents whose kids have played at the fountain
and had any of the symptoms ask their doctors to take a stool sample.
Giardia can be fought only with appropriate medication, he said.
Matt Jordan, owner of Specialty Management Co. of Central Florida,
which is in charge of maintenance at Avalon Park, said he has fired
the contractor responsible for the spray jets' upkeep.
Toth responded that his department usually does not notify the
community until an investigation has concluded. He estimated that
might take two to three more weeks.

A fountain in an east Orange County subdivision is making kids sick,
forcing the Health Department to shut it down.
Five kids have already had their stomach problems linked to the
fountain, but the Health Department thinks there are more cases.
The fountain is on Tonya King Boulevard in the Avalon Park
subdivision. A 'closed' sign went up after the Health Department shut
down the fountain.
The closure was not just due to a lack of chlorine and Channel 9
discovered there have been problems before.
Four-year-old Sarah Fair put on her suit Wednesday, but she's stuck
on the swing. The fountain she hoped to play on was closed. "She's
pretty disappointed. She likes it here. We meet our friends here,"
said Cara Fair, Sarah's mother.
Earlier in September, 5 toddlers who played at the fountain were
infected with a parasite. It caused severe diarrhea, but there
shouldn't be any long-term effects.
According to a Health Department inspection report, there was no
chlorine in the fountain's water and the filter was not working. Cara
Fair is relieved her daughter is well. "If my daughter was one of
them, I'd be very angry, to get sick needlessly when they should be
maintaining the fountain," she said.
Channel 9 discovered it wasn't the first time the fountain has had
trouble. It was closed last May and December for problems with
chlorine and the pH.
Wednesday, the management company for the subdivision said they plan
to fire the pool company in charge of maintenance, but it's probably
not enough to get the Fairs back in the water.
The Health Department knows of 5 children who have come down with the
parasitic infection after playing at the fountain, but they said
there could be more cases. If your child has been sick, the Health
Department suggests you get him or her to the doctor to see if it is
tied to the fountain.

[This is the first time that ProMED has reported an outbreak of
Giardia from a water fountain in a playground, but spread of
Cryptosporidia by this route has been seen. Giardia is more
susceptible to chlorination than Cryptosporidia and the reported
outbreak is related to poor maintenance including a lack of
chlorination. If the water source is drinking water, this mean that
the drinking water in the county also contains Giardia and needs to
be chlorinated. - Mod.EP]
