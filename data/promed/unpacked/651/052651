[1] Meat packing plants, transmission explained

If there is a paradise for SARS-CoV-2, it would probably be a slaughterhouse. Work units in meat plants are cooled to under 12 degrees Celsius [53.6 degrees Fahrenheit]. Workers stand near one another and sweat as they labor under pressure - an ideal situation for viruses transmitted by droplets, aerosols, or contact.

Canadian and British researchers working under Quentin Durand-Moreau of the University of Alberta have studied the working conditions in meat plants. The "metallic surfaces" and the "low temperatures," they report, enhance the longevity of viruses like SARS-CoV-2. They also explain that the plants are often very loud: "The need for raised voices to overcome noise may increase transmission of SARS-CoV-2," the researchers wrote. Workers, they argue, also feel pressured by their precarious work situation to "keep working despite having symptoms of COVID-19."

"The working conditions in the slaughterhouses cannot be reconciled with the hygiene measures that are currently necessary," warns Isabella Eckerle, the head of the Geneva Center for Emerging Viral Diseases. At the Toennies slaughterhouse, the virologist says, the large number of infected employees points to "an undetected superspreading event." She explains that, if there were close contact and unfavorable working and living conditions, a single infected person or a small number of infected people could potentially have infected many other employees.

"The physical exertion during the work, which leads to greater virus expulsion, is another possible factor," Eckerle says. Damp hands and gloves, aprons, and clothing worn during meat handling could also facilitate the virus being transmitted via smear infections.

Coronaviruses have a relatively strong, fatty shell that gives them a kind of rubber-like protection in cool conditions. That makes them robust. Researchers have already shown that SARS-CoV-2 can survive up to 72 hours on surfaces in temperatures between 21 and 23 deg C (70 and 73 deg F). Lower temperatures extend that time even further. Experiments show that the viruses can survive longer than 28 days at 4 deg C [39.2 deg F].

Coolness is also ideal for the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Health expert Tom Jefferson from Oxford University says the virus transmits best at temperatures between 0 and 10 deg C [32 and 50 deg F], with low humidity, high air pressure, and little wind. High temperatures and strong UV radiation, he says, inhibit the spread of the virus.

That's good news for summer in central Europe, where the virus's infectiousness is presumably decreasing at the moment. But this is not the case in cooled slaughterhouses. To make matters worse, the plants' cool air is constantly circulated by air conditioning, a constant stream of air that also helps the viruses spread. These can be kept in the air for several hours by fine aerosols and travel large distances.

Even just a few infected workers would be enough to trigger a "local epidemic," says Jefferson. "If on top of that, workers also live in shared accommodations and, for example, take the same buses from those accommodations to the abattoirs, it would be very difficult to stop the spread."

Are consumers at risk?
----------------------
The Toennies contract workers were thus in constant danger of infecting themselves. But are the consumers who buy and eat the slaughterhouse's meat also in danger?

Coronaviruses are even more stable when they are frozen than when they are cooled. Experiments with other coronaviruses have shown that they can remain infectious for up to 2 years at -20 deg C [-4 deg F]. Nevertheless, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from supermarket meat to a consumer is unlikely.

The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) writes that the contamination of meat or meat products with coronaviruses could "theoretically take place during the slaughter or during the meat cutting and processing." The BfR writes, however, that so far, there have been "no known infections with SARS-CoV-2 via the consumption of meat products or contact with contaminated meat products."

Theoretically, coronaviruses could be transmitted from an infected person onto sausage or meat, the BfR continues. But in the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, it claims, the mode of transmission through meat consumption "plays no role, based on current knowledge."

"It is very unlikely that supermarket customers will be infected by meat," says Jefferson. Of course, normal hygiene rules should be maintained with meat. "Wash your hands often, never consume raw meat, always cook or fry it, and store the meat separately from other foodstuffs," the researcher advises.

How could outbreaks like the one in Rheda-Wiedenbrueck be prevented in the future?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Researchers from the United States' Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have examined COVID-19 cases in 115 slaughterhouses in the US. In the pandemic's early months, about 4900 of 130 000 workers became infected. By the end of April [2020], this had led to 20 deaths due to the virus.

Like others, the CDC researchers blame the relatively large numbers of cases on the small distances between the workers and the tight living and transport conditions. They have called for the implementation of "outdoor break areas," "physical barriers between workers," stricter hygiene measures, and additional staff who regularly and thoroughly disinfect the workplaces.

But Jefferson is skeptical that measures like that will go far enough. "I'm not sure how distancing and hygiene rules can even be maintained in such working conditions," he says. To prevent local outbreaks, he argues, radical steps are necessary -- like, for example, comprehensive testing. And yet even that doesn't always seem to help. The workers in many slaughterhouses were tested in May [2020], including Toennies. A number of tests came back positive at the time. But that also didn't stop a local outbreak.

[The challenge is preventing the superspreading event from happening. Is daily rapid testing of all employees feasible? The ongoing outbreak in Germany associated with a meat packing plant has raised this issue to the forefront.

In another media report submitted by Mary Marshall (<mjm2020@googlemail.com>), as of Fri 26 Jun 2020, there were 2203 confirmed cases at the Toennies meat packing plant and 75 residents of the district (Guetersloh) without a connection to the plant. (https://www.dw.com/en/germany-g%C3%BCtersloh-slaughterhouse-infections-spread-to-community/a-53971931) demonstrating the order of magnitude of the transmission within the meat packing plant and the impact on the surrounding community.

[2] China (Hebei): lockdown

China has reinstated a strict lockdown near Beijing, affecting around 400 000 people, after a small surge in cases. The restrictions have come into force in Anxin country in Hebei province near the capital. After the pandemic emerged in China at the end of last year [2019], the country has managed to get new infections to a consistently low level. To avoid a 2nd wave, even small surges are taken very seriously by the country's health authorities. Officials announced on Sunday [28 Jun 2020] that Anxin would be "fully enclosed and controlled."

Only essential workers are allowed to leave their homes, while one member of a household is allowed to go out once a day to shop for necessities. No non-residents will be allowed to enter buildings, communities, or villages. Authorities have warned anyone violating the rules will be punished by police. Anxin is around 150 km (90 miles) south of Beijing. Chinese media say there have been 18 cases in the county since the beginning of the recent surge in Beijing 2 weeks ago.

Over the past 24 hours, Beijing reported 14 new cases of the virus, taking the total since a mid-June [2020] outbreak in a food market to 311. Several neighbourhoods in Beijing were put under restrictions, travel was limited, and a massive wave of fresh testing was rolled out.

Before the recent spike, the Chinese capital had gone 57 days without a locally-transmitted case.

Since mid-June [2020], new infections [in China] have been mostly limited to Beijing with some spillover into neighbouring Hebei. The rest of China has seen only a small trickle of single-digit infections, most of which were imported cases, which means travellers returning from abroad.

[As of the end of day 28 Jun 2020, the tally of cases in Beijing is 318 and in Hebei 21. While the numbers of cases are small compared with countries in other regions, this highlights how quickly a country can implement control measures including massive testing of potentially exposed population in a geographic area to identify all infected individuals (testing of asymptomatic as well as symptomatic individuals), in order to interrupt transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Time will tell if this interrupts the transmission chains in the affected areas.

[3] WHO situation report 160 (as of 28 Jun 2020)
Date: Sun 28 Jun 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200628-covid-19-sitrep-160.pdf


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 28 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- Today [28 Jun 2020] we report a record number of new cases in the last 24 hours globally (189 077 cases), with several countries reporting their highest number of new cases in a 24-hour period. As Dr Tedros remarked in his media briefing on [24 Jun 2020], '(E)ven as we continue research into vaccines and therapeutics we have an urgent responsibility to do everything we can with the tools we have now to suppress transmission and save lives.' WHO has recently updated guidance on critical actions countries can take.

- Planes carrying more than 4.7 million items of personal protective equipment, procured by WHO/Europe with funding from the European Union, have landed in Azerbaijan, Belarus, and Ukraine over the last 2 days. The essential protective equipment will help healthcare workers in the 3 countries respond effectively and safely to the COVID-19 pandemic.

- The phenomenon of an 'infodemic' has escalated to a level that requires a coordinated response. An infodemic is an overabundance of information -- some accurate and some not -- occurring during an epidemic. WHO is holding its 1st Infodemiology Conference, with a public conference on [29 Jun 2020] followed by a scientific conference from [30 Jun 2020] through [16 Jul 2020].

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update (please note that there has been consistent weekend reporting artifact since the presentation of these data began):
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 62.0% of the global newly reported cases and 68.7% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period. Brazil reported 40.0% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, and the USA reported 37.9%, Mexico 4.6%, Chile 3.8%, Colombia 3.3%, Peru 3.2%, and Ecuador 2.5%. The same 5 countries remained at the top; the USA and Brazil are usually numbers 1 and 2, although they vary for which of the 2 positions they hold, but other countries are continuing to increase their proportional representation within the region.

The European region reported 8.8% of the global newly reported cases and 7.6% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region. Russia reported 40.9% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Turkey 8.3%, Ukraine 5.5%, the UK 5.4 %, Armenia 4.4%, Spain 3.4%, Azerbaijan 3.1%,Kazakhstan 2.8%, and Belarus 2.3%. The proportion of cases represented by Russia has fallen. Sweden did not report any newly confirmed cases today. Armenia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, and Belarus are prominent in countries noted to have resurgence in Europe.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 9.5% of the global newly reported cases and 10.5% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 22.7% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia 21.9%, Iran 13.7%, Iraq 11.5%, Egypt 6.5%, Oman 5.1%, Qatar 4.9%, and Kuwait 3.8%. Multiple countries are very active in the region.

The African region reported 5.7% of the global newly reported cases and 2.4% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 67.3% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 7.3%, Ghana 5.6%, and Algeria and Kenya 2.6% each. Other countries of prior prominence are less than 2%. While South Africa and Nigeria are usually numbers 1 and 2 in terms of the 24-hour increase in cases, other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.67% of the global newly reported cases and 0.26% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 58.0% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 23.1%, Japan 7.4 %, South Korea 4.9%, Australia 3.7%, and China 1.4%. The outbreak associated with the Beijing Seafood markets continues to bring China to prominence in terms of daily newly confirmed cases. That said, the Philippines and Singapore are consistently numbers 1 and 2, respectively, and the other countries, including Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Australia, vary in daily reporting.

The South-East Asia region reported 13.4% of the global newly reported cases and 10.5% of global deaths. India reported 78.4% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 13.8%, Indonesia 5.4%, and Nepal 2.2%. Same countries, same order as in previous days, with India continuing to be the driving force in the regional growth in cases.

Impression: The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis, followed by the South-East Asia region, then Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean alternating on a daily basis of their order, today's major decrease in Europe's reporting may well be weekend reporting artifact, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily case load of all of the regions.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 28 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the above text. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South-East Asia, in terms of daily newly confirmed cases; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is "not applicable"; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 10 243 010, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.6% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.63 million confirmed cases, now represents 25.7% of the global cases of COVID-19, and Brazil with more than 1.34 million cases represents 13.1% of the global cases of COVID-19. Other countries such as Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases as well. If one tallies the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, Russia, India, and the UK), they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (53.5%). A global total of 504 366 deaths have been reported, an increase of 3068 deaths in the past 24 hours. A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact-tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections are significantly underreported: actual numbers may be 10-20 times larger. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home, who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, the UK, Spain, Peru, Chile, Italy, and Iran at number 10. China is number 22. In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa, Chile, Pakistan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Bangladesh; all countries that are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots.

The top 20 countries in terms of cumulative cases include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region, no change in the past 24 hours. There are no countries from the Western Pacific region. The top 20 countries in terms of numbers of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include 8 from the Americas region, 6 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the European region, 3 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region (an increase of 1 in the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, and South East Asia regions and a decrease in 3 from the European region). Again, there are no countries from the Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.MPP]
