Seven Amado [Pima county] residents are going through a series of rabies shots after they were exposed to rabid kittens.

A quarantined cat is at the Pima Animal Care Center [PACC]. 15 cats and 2 dogs are in quarantine after being exposed to a rabid skunk and rabid kittens at an Amado home.

An Amado resident called the Pima Animal Care Center on 4 Jun 2019 to report several of her kittens had recently died. She said her 2 dogs had been in a fight with a skunk 2 weeks earlier and asked whether the deaths of the cats could be related, said PACC Director Kristen Hassen-Auerbach. The skunk was killed.

The woman had just been bitten by another kitten and was concerned about possible rabies exposure, Hassen-Auerbach said.

PACC took custody of 3 dead kittens and 1 sick kitten and provided the woman with outdoor cat enclosures so she could keep her remaining 15 cats and kittens quarantined, Hassen-Auerbach said. The county also asked her to keep her dogs -- which received rabies vaccinations years ago -- isolated. It was unclear whether the dogs' rabies shots were current [at the time of this writing. - Mod.TG].

On 7 Jun 2019, PACC learned 2 of the kittens tested positive for rabies and PACC seized the rest of the woman's animals 8 Jun 2019.

The skunk, which had been buried, couldn't be tested because it had been dug up and devoured, she said. It's unknown if it was eaten by the dogs or wildlife, said Michele Figueroa, PACC director of operations.

An investigation revealed the woman, 5 relatives, and a neighbor had direct contact with the kitten and will receive a series of 5 shots over the next 2 weeks, said Aaron Pacheco, a spokesman for the Pima County Health Department. There is no need to isolate any of those going through the vaccinations and studies show the vaccinations are 100 percent effective on people who receive the shots prior to displaying rabies symptoms, Pacheco said.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, an infected person could theoretically transmit rabies, but no such cases have been documented and contact with someone who is receiving rabies vaccination does mean they've been exposed to rabies or they're at risk for an infection.

Rabies symptoms can show up within a matter of weeks up to a year. "When they become symptomatic, the outcome is usually death," he said.

The 2 dogs taken in by PACC will be in quarantine for 45 days and the felines will be in quarantine for 120 days.

This is the 1st rabies case involving a domestic animal in several years in Pima county. According to the Arizona Department of Health Services, there have been 66 lab-confirmed animal rabies cases in Arizona this year [2019].

Two of the cases were the Amado cats; a cat in Cochise county also tested positive, state records show. Skunks accounted for 34 cases, followed by 14 fox, 13 bats, 1 javelina, and 1 coyote.

PACC chief veterinarian Jennifer Wilcox recommends booster rabies vaccinations for pets and livestock that may come into contact with wildlife, Hassen-Auerbach said.

The doctor also believes all cats and dogs should be vaccinated against rabies, whether they reside inside or out.

[2] New Jersey: bat, human exposure

https://www.nj.com/news/2019/06/bat-found-in-bedroom-of-nj-home-tests-positive-for-rabies.html


A bat found in the bedroom of a home in Middlesex county last week [week of 27 May 2019] tested positive for rabies, health officials said.

Animal control officers caught the bat after being called to a house in South Plainfield on [25 May 2019], the Middlesex County Office of Health Services said in a statement [Tue 4 Jun 2019]. The mammal was then brought to be tested at a state department of health laboratory.

The bat is the 5th rabid animal found in Middlesex county this year [2019] and the 1st in South Plainfield.

Health officials advised the resident of the house where the bat was located to see a doctor for post-exposure treatment. All residents are asked to avoid wild animals, report bites immediately and make sure pets' vaccinations are up to date.

The rabies virus is found in the saliva of a rabid animal and is transmitted by bite, or possibly by contamination of an open cut, officials said. Bats, skunks, groundhogs, foxes, cats, and dogs account for 95 percent of animals diagnosed with rabies in the Unites States.

Rabies can be fatal and any bite should be taken seriously, officials warn.

[What a wonderful opportunity for these communities to educate the public regarding rabies. Yet these articles do not indicate any rabies drive or educational issues occurring in those areas.

Rabies vaccination for most pets is required on annual or 3-year basis based on the age of vaccination, the number of rabies vaccination, and the rabies burden in the area. But vaccination of your pets is a measure of protecting both your pets and yourself.

Rabies is fatal in almost all individuals without proper post exposure prophylaxis. Unfortunately, animals without a rabies prevention vaccination are destined for death, either by the disease or because there is no treatment for rabies for our pet.

Humans need to have the wound cleaned and dressed. An individual will likely need to receive post exposure prophylaxis. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, post-exposure anti-rabies vaccination should always include administration of both passive antibody and vaccine. The combination of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment. People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving pre-exposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk with your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have the shot at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. The prophylaxis you are receiving will protect you from developing rabies, and, therefore, you cannot expose other people to rabies. You should continue to participate in your normal activities.

Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin and rabies vaccine given on the day of the exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14.

If a person has previously received post-exposure vaccinations or received pre-exposure vaccinations, only 2 doses of vaccine (on the day of exposure and then 3 days later) are needed. Human rabies immune globulin is not required. Your doctor and local health department will be able to guide you through the process (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html).

However, animals who have been vaccinated will need their wounds cleaned and cared for. They will be re-vaccinated and, depending upon the specific state, are likely to be quarantined for a period of time. If the bitten animal has not been vaccinated, the animal is likely to be euthanized, as it presents a risk of rabies to its owners.

The lesson is to keep your animals vaccinated. Check with your veterinarian regarding your state and county law on frequency of vaccination for your pets. Pets include dogs, cats, horses, cattle, and other animals you have contact with. - Mod.TG
