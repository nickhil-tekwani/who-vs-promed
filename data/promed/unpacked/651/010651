From: Richard Frankel <rfrankel@hawaii.edu>

I am not an expert in _Angiostrongylus_ sp., though I have cared for
clinical cases. A variety of snails and slugs may transmit this helminth.
It can also be transmitted by aquatic hosts in which the helminth cannot
develop to the adult stage. Giant African snails have been implicated,
though I have not seen data regarding prevalence in these snails.
Collecting snails could in theory transmit the helminth if one didn't do
sufficient hand-washing. I don't know whether this route of infection has
been proven.
Infection has been transmitted by ingestion of inadequately washed produce,
with the helminths presumably deposited by the snails or slugs. These
worms are killed by cooking, and thus there should be no risk from cooked
snails, again with caution
about handwashing following handling of the uncooked mollusks.
