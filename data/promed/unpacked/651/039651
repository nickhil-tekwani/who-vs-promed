Signs of an animal virus discovered in man who received a pig's heart
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A 57-year-old Maryland man who survived for 2 months with a heart transplanted from a genetically altered pig carried signs of a virus that infects the animals, according to the surgeon who performed the first-of-its-kind procedure. The disclosure bolsters one of the most pressing objections to animal-to-human transplants, which is that widespread use of modified animal organs may facilitate the introduction of new pathogens into the human population.

The presence of viral DNA in the patient may indicate an infection that contributed to his sudden deterioration and death on 8 Mar 2022, Dr. Bartley Griffith, a transplant surgeon at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said during a presentation to the American Society of Transplantation. Dr. Griffith's comments were first reported by MIT Technology Review.

The pig was genetically modified so that its organs would not prompt rejection by the human immune system. The heart was provided to the patient by Revivicor, a regenerative medicine company based in Blacksburg, Virginia.

Company officials declined to comment on Thursday [5 May 2022]. University officials said the animal had been screened for the virus, called porcine cytomegalovirus. But the tests pick up only active infections, not latent ones in which the virus may hide quietly in the pig's body. The transplant was initially deemed successful. He did not show signs of rejecting the organ, and the pig's heart continued to function for well over a month, passing a critical milestone for transplant patients.

A test indicated the presence of porcine CMV in the patient 20 days after the transplant, but at such a low level that Dr. Griffith said he thought it might have been a lab error. At 45 days after the surgery, the patient became acutely ill, and subsequent tests showed a precipitous rise in levels of the virus, Dr. Griffith said. "So we started thinking that the virus that showed up very early at day 20 as just a twinkle started to grow in time, and it may have been the actor -- it could have been the actor -- that set this all off," Dr. Griffith told other transplant scientists.

The patient's health deteriorated abruptly 45 days after the surgery, he said. "At day 45, he looked really funky," Dr. Griffith said. "Something happened. He looked sick. He lost his attention. He wouldn't talk to us. He lay in bed breathing hard, and was kind of warm."

The heart transplant was one of several groundbreaking transplants in recent months that offer hope to the tens of thousands of patients who need new kidneys, hearts and lungs amid a dire shortage of donated human organs. But the prospect of unforeseen consequences -- and particularly the potential introduction of an animal disease into the human population -- may dampen enthusiasm for the use of genetically modified organs.

[These are 2 publications discussing porcine CMV transmission to primates from xenotransplants. It is not clear to me that pCMV has been transmitted to humans before:

2. Denner J, LÃ¤ngin M, Reichart B, et al. Impact of porcine cytomegalovirus on long-term orthotopic cardiac xenotransplant survival. Scientific Reports 2020; 10: Article number 17531 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73150-9)

The following is extracted from Denner, et al. The references can be found in the original URL:

Xenotransplantation with genetically modified porcine organs, as an alternative to allogenic (human-to-human) procedures may be associated with the transmission of porcine microorganisms, among them the porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs). PERVs are integrated in the genome of all pigs and they are able to infect human cells (2). However, until now no PERV transmission was observed in the first preclinical (for review see ref. 2) and clinical xenotransplantation trials (3,4). Whereas PERV-A and PERV-B, which are present in all pigs, infect human cells, PERV-C infects only pig cells and is not present in all pigs (2). However, recombinations between PERV-A and PERV-C can occur and the recombinant PERV-A/C is characterized by a higher replication competence (5). Therefore, it is highly recommended to use PERV-C-free pigs for xenotransplantation. Interestingly, using CRISPR/Cas all retroviral sequences can be inactivated in the pig genome (7), however, it is still unclear whether this is needed for a safe xenotransplantation (9).

From the other viruses widely distributed in pigs, the porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV) is of great concern (10). PCMV is related with the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), also called human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5). HCMV causes fatal infections in human organ transplant recipients if not treated, leading to end-organ disease, such as gastrointestinal ulceration, hepatitis, pneumonitis or retinitis. HCMV can also lead to systemic infection and disease once a threshold value of virus load is exceeded (11). In fact, HCMV has also been detected in the bowel mucosa where its reactivation has been suggested to lead to IL-6 release and inflammatory bowel disease (12). - Mod.LL
