A cholera-like vibrio has been found in 10 water reservoirs of Volgograd,
a representative of the dangerous infections section of the State Sanitary
and Epidemiological Inspectorate told Tass.
All the water reservoirs of the city have been taken under special control
of the sanitary and epidemiological service. The vibrio was found as well
in water samples taken near the right bank of the Volga.
Medics say that the finding of the vibrio does not mean the appearance of
cholera in the Volgograd Region. The cholera-like vibrio, however, is not
only evidence [of the potential for a cholera outbreak. In addition to
that, it may cause other intestinal infectious diseases.
Additional preventive measures against the dangerous infection were taken
in Volgograd.

[Volgograd is 300m (500km) downstream on the Volga from Saransk, the area of
the cholera outbreak reported in ProMED-mail's periodic cholera summary for
24 June 1999 Part 2 (cited above). We presume this story refers to
non-cholera vibrios, those which are not agglutinated by cholera polyvalent
O1 antiserum. Such strains are common in surface waters, and some can cause
intestinal disease, usually much less severe than cholera. ProMED-mail's
periodic cholera summary for 26 May 1999 (cited above) includes a report of
dysentery outbreaks in this region. It is possible that this public health
report is related to those events. Further characterization of the vibrios
isolated would be helpful. - Mod.ES
