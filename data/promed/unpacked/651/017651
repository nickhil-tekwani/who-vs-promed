Study: Facial cancer killing Tasmanian devils
-----------------------------------------------
Tasmanian devils, animals found only in Tasmania, are dying in droves
from a facial cancer that scientists said, on Wednesday [1 Feb 2006],
they are spreading to each other through bites. In a report in the
journal Nature, the scientists said a genetic analysis of the cancer
shows the tumors are identical in each animal they studied. "We
propose that the disease is transmitted by ... an infectious cell
line passed directly between the animals through bites they inflict
on one another," said Anne-Maree Pearse of the Department of Primary
Industries, Water and Environment (DPIWE) in Tasmania.
Tasmanian devils are marsupials, mammals which carry their young in a
pouch. The mostly black, dog-sized animals, the world's largest
surviving carnivorous marsupials, acquired their name because of
their spine-chilling screech.
The cancer produces large tumors on the face and neck of the animals
which interfere with feeding, and death usually occurs within 6
months. Up to 80 percent of infected animals have died. Scientists
suspect infected animals pass on the malignant cells when they bite
each other during a fight or courtship.
Pearse and a colleague found the tumors had 13 rather than the normal
14 chromosomes. The chromosomes were abnormal, but their arrangement
was identical in tumors taken from different animals. They suspect
the low genetic diversity of the animals might reduce their immune
response to the cancerous cell transferred during biting.
Scientists in Tasmania are trying to separate infected animals from
healthy ones to limit the spread of the disease.
