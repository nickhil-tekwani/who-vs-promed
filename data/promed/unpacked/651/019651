Outbreak of carbunco or anthrax in Tacna
----------------------------------------
With respect to the presentation of an outbreak of cutaneous carbunco
(anthrax) in the locality of Las Yaras, Sama District, Province of Tacna,
which came from the newspaper "El Comercio" on 9 Jan 2005
(<http://www.elcomercioperu.com.pe>) it is necessary to clarify the following:
On 23 Dec [2004] the locality of "Las Yara" reported the death of 3
caprines and between 26 Dec 2004 and 9 Jan 2005 they reported the death of
15 bovines, whose owners reported that they had buried them. On 27 Dec 2004
a bovine died, having been worked on and manipulated by various
people. The exposed people began to develop cutaneous lesions 4 days
later. In total there are 10 people with cutaneous carbunco (anthrax), 7 of
whom were hospitalized and 3 were managed as outpatients. The diagnosis was
confirmed by isolation of _Bacillus anthracis_. All the patients have
progressed favorably with antibiotic treatment and 4 of those admitted to
hospital have already been discharged.
70 per cent of the cases are men, aged from 29 to 82 years, whose principal
occupation is raising or sales of livestock.
Prevention and control measures taken for the outbreak were implemented by
the sanitary authorities of the Tacna Regional Health Department in
coordination with the National Animal Health Service. The principal method
of prevention is vaccination against carbunco (anthrax) of susceptible
livestock in enzootic areas or of livestock that will travel to these areas.
There had been a confusion on the part of the journalist who wrote the news
article, having related "fiebre carbonosa" [anthrax] (also known as
carbunco in animals) with "fiebre aftosa" [foot and mouth disease]. The
southern zone of Peru, where Tacna is, is an "area free of foot and mouth
disease, without vaccination".

[We also had messages from Ainslie Brown (SVO, Canberra), Cesar Carcamo
(Universidad Peruana, Lima), Albino Belotto (PAHO, Washington, DC) and Hugo
Tamayo (PAHO, Lima) reinforcing what Dr More has reported in detail; plus a
commentary from Luis L Rodriguez, Plum Island, on FMDV & VSV. We also
learnt belatedly that ProMED-ESP had apparently got it right first time
around quoting Peruvian newspaper reports. While we regret the initial
confusion it does show the strength of ProMED-mail that we can and do get
the facts for our members from the "horse's mouth". A full report from
SENASA is expected in due course. In 2003 Peru reported anthrax outbreaks
in Cajamarca, Huanuco, Ica, Lima and Tumbes, and reports 21 to 47 human
cases per year, except for 1996 when some 228 cases were reported. In that
SENASA was "rushing" 4000 vaccine doses to the area suggests that their
control policy is more reactive than proactive. Also they buried their
carcasses instead of burning them. It is interesting to note that this
appears to be the first ProMED-mail report of anthrax in Peru, despite its
annual frequency there. - Mod.MHJ]
