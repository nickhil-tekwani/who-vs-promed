A mysterious skin-worm sickness has hit several
villages around Mafikeng in the North West,
health officials said on Tuesday. "We have never
experienced anything like this," said provincial
health spokesperson Tebogo Lekgethwane. "People
come to clinics complaining that their body is
itching. Within 3 days small sores develop. A
yellow spot then develops from each sore as it
gets ripe. Once the sore is expressed a worm
comes out of it." Lekgethwane said one theory had
it that unidentified insects were laying eggs on
clothes and that the eggs then penetrated the skin to mature into a worm.
The North West health department warned villages
around Mafikeng on Tuesday to report to a clinic
if they noticed sores developing on their bodies.
People from villages near Mafikeng have been
treated since December 2005 for the condition.
"During visits to the homes of these people, it
was found that dogs were also affected," said
Lekgethwane. The department of agriculture's
veterinary public health and animal unit had
taken specimens of the worms to identify their origin.
The province's health MEC, Nomonde Rasmeni, said
his department would not rest until the source of
sickness was determined. "We have already sent
our diseases outbreak team to affected villages
to collate information on this recent health
hazard. We are also consulting with experts
nationwide as this is a new phenomenon in North
West," said Rasmeni. She advised people in
affected villages to iron their clothes,
especially underwear, before wearing them.

[The medical sector is not exempt from having
dissenting opinions when it comes to clinical
diagnoses, especially when they are being made
based on lay press reports of "mystery" and
"unknown" illnesses -- and especially when we are
doing so without seeing first-hand what is being
described. Hence, we have chosen to present
below the differing opinions on the possible
etiology of the outbreak described above. - Mod.MPP]
[From the description its is most probably
cutaneous larva migrans, which is common in
Southern Africa. Cutaneous larva migrans is
caused by a dog or pig hookworm, the eggs of
which are passed through the feces of cats and
dogs. The eggs hatch in the ground and the
infection is passed when unprotected skins comes
in contact with contaminated earth. The itching
is intense and secondary infections are possible,
but larva migrans is otherwise not dangerous. - Mod.EP]
[It is difficult to identify the cause of this
outbreak with any certainty, but from the
description of "worms" coming out of sores it
seems that it could be myiasis due to the Tumbu
fly (_Cordylobia anthropophaga_) also called the
Putzi fly. The Tumbu fly is found from Ethiopia
through West, Central and East Africa down to the
former Transvaal and KwaZulu-Natal areas of South Africa.
Female flies lay their eggs on the ground,
especially if is contaminated with urine. They
are also attracted to soiled nappies (diapers)
and often to clothing placed on the floor to dry.
Minute larvae hatching from the eggs get
transferred from clothing to humans and burrow
into the skin, producing boil-like swellings.
After 8-12 days the mature larvae (often termed
maggots) wriggle out and drop to the ground, and
turn into puparia (commonly called pupae), from
which the adult flies emerge 8-15 days later.
Usually there is only one larva per boil-like
(furuncular) swelling, but sometimes 1-3, rarely
more, larvae may be present in a single
swelling. These lesions are found mainly on the
trunk, being especially common on the buttocks
and shoulders. Although these swellings may
exude serous fluids they do not usually contain
pus. A common method of extracting a larva is to
cover the small hole in the swelling with
medicinal paraffin which prevents the larva from
breathing through its posterior spiracles, with
the result that the larva wriggles further out of
the swelling. In so doing it lubricates the
pocket in the skin and if one presses gently
around the swelling, the larva can usually be squeezed out.
Infections can be prevented, or minimized, by
ensuring that clothing, bed linen and towels are
not spread on the ground to dry, and also by ironing.
Dogs and rats are commonly infected with Tumbu fly maggots.
It would be interesting to learn whether this
reported infection is caused by the Tumbu fly. - Mod.MS]
[As an additional note from an epidemiological
perspective, the above newswire presents this as
an apparent outbreak, suggesting that this has
not been seen before in the North West Province
of South Africa. While the Tumbu fly has been
identified in the former Transvaal and in
KwaZulu-Natal Provinces, it is possible that this
is a new introduction of the fly into the North
West Province (which does border on parts of the
former Transvaal
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/south_africa.jpg>
and
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/SF/1/Mafikeng.html>),
so that the population is not aware of either the
disease (myiasis) or preventive measures as
mentioned above in Mod.MS's comment. ProMED-mail
would appreciate more information from
knowledgeable sources in South Africa who might
have the definitive, rather than speculative diagnosis here. - Mod.MPP]
