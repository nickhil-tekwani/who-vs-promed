[With the development of oral vaccines and bait delivery systems, the elimination of rabies and other diseases circulating in wildlife became a realistic possibility. Large-scale oral vaccination programmes have eliminated fox rabies from Western Europe and greatly reduced incidence in Central Europe. The oral vaccination campaign in Slovakia started in 1993. The last fox rabies case reported in Slovakia was in 2006, after which it was regarded as rabies-free until a new case was reported a year ago (ProMED post 20130110.1490773).

This finding is an alert that the virus is circulating in the fox population despite vaccination efforts.
