- 71 suspected cases under investigation.
- 9 new confirmed cases, including 1 in Beni, 1 in Katwa, 1 in Mabalako, and 6 in Komanda.
- 8 new confirmed case deaths, including 1 in Beni, 3 in Butembo, 1 in Mabalako, and 3 in Komanda (3 community deaths).
- 4 new people healed, including 3 outings from Butembo ETC and 1 from Beni ETC.

News of the response
Epidemiological surveillance
----------------------------
- An outbreak of Ebola cases was reported in a village in the health zone of Komanda, located 90 minutes from Beni. This outbreak is linked to a confirmed case who died at the ETC of Beni last week [week of 26 Nov 2018]. A vaccination team was dispatched to Komanda and began vaccinating the family and neighboring households on 3 Dec 2018.

Youth engagement
-----------------
- The minister of health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, kicked off the "Ebola Pas Chez Moi" football tournament on Tue 4 Dec 2018 in Beni. Football is the most popular sport among the youth of Beni and Butembo. For 2 weeks, 21 teams from Butembo and 26 teams from Beni will compete to win the Cup of Hope. In his speech, the minister thanked the young athletes for their involvement in raising public awareness through sport. Through their exemplary commitment, they prove that the community is now at the forefront of the response and that young people want to make a difference.

Vaccination
-----------
- Continuation of vaccination of frontline providers in Lubero as a preventive measure in the context of the preparation of the health zone.
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 39 845 people have been vaccinated, including 18 058 in Beni [North Kivu], 5903 in Katwa [North Kivu], 4544 on Mabalako [North Kivu], 3483 in Butembo [North Kivu], 1997 in Kalunguta [North Kivu], 1663 in Mandima [Ituri], 750 in Masereka [North Kivu], 659 in Vuhovi [North Kivu], 549 in Mutwanga [North Kivu], 521 in Oicha [North Kivu], 434 in Bunia [Ituri], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 260 in Komanda [Ituri], 241 in Kyondo [North Kivu], 234 in Musienene [North Kivu], 160 in Lubero [North Kivu], and 34 in Alimbongo [North Kivu].

#Ebola: +9 cases & +8 deaths today, including 6 cases & 3 community deaths at Komanda, 90 minutes north of Beni. Clearly something going on; responders have been dispatched to investigate. Previously there was a case there in late Sep. New introduction? Missed transmission?

2. Looks like it's going to be a bad day for #Ebola numbers. +9? What's going on in Komanda, anyone know? There was a case there in late Sep & nothing for 2 months & now 6 more? New introduction? Or is it related to the Ndindi (neighborhood of Beni) community?]

[2] Response
- Tue 4 Dec 2018. More Ebola in DRC as WHO says it has outbreak "covered"
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/12/more-ebola-drc-who-says-it-has-outbreak-covered

The Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) grew by 9 cases today [4 Dec 2018], according to a daily update from the country's ministry of health. There are now 453 cases (405 confirmed and 48 probable), including 268 deaths (220 confirmed and 48 probable). Seventy-one people are still under investigation for possible infections.

Yesterday [3 Dec 2018], Doctors without Borders (MSF), one of the key response organizations working on this outbreak, said that several new cases have been in remote areas surrounding Butembo, one of the largest cities in North Kivu.

"We are very concerned by the epidemiological situation in the Butembo area," John Johnson, MSF project coordinator in Butembo, said in a press release. Though the number of cases in recent days in Butembo is low, more cases in isolated districts to the east of the city have been appearing.

"We're expecting this outbreak will last for a while, and we must increase our efforts to get it under control. With the agreement of the authorities, we have made a strategic decision to roll out our activities close to the affected populations and to organize training of key people in the community so that we can reach patients and their relatives," Johnson said.

MSF said the number of beds at the Ebola treatment center (ETC) in Butembo has doubled in recent weeks, from fewer than 30 when the outbreak began in August [2018] to 64. MSF also opened a 48-bed transit center in Beni, the town that's been the epicenter of the outbreak in the past 2 months.

MSF also said at least 2000 vaccine recipients have been frontline health workers. According to the DRC ministry of health, 39 845 people have been vaccinated in the country.

Today [4 Dec 2018], 6 of the new cases were reported in Komanda in Ituri province, one of the towns north of Butembo. And 3 deaths in Komanda were listed as "community deaths," which means they did not occur in an ETC or hospital. Such cases raise the risk of transmission, because virus levels are at their highest at the time of death, and people caring for loved ones in the community lack the type of personal protective equipment found in healthcare settings.

Officials from the DRC said the outbreak was linked to a confirmed case from Beni who died at an ETC last week [week of 26 Nov 2018]. A vaccination team was dispatched to Komanda on [Mon 3 Dec 2018] and has been vaccinating contacts.

The other 3 cases reported today were from Beni, Katwa, and Mabalako. Also, the ministry said 8 more people died from their infections, lifting the fatality count to 268.

According to the Associated Press (AP), World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, told reporters yesterday [Mon 3 Dec 2018] in Geneva that the WHO could "cover" the Ebola outbreak, in response to 2 recent editorials (in the New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA Network Open) by American public health experts who argue the USA needs to send healthcare workers to the DRC to stop the outbreak.

In September [2018], the US State Department under White House orders pulled US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staff and other personnel from the region, citing local violence and security concerns. CDC director Robert Redfield, MD, has gone on record saying he disagrees with the decision. The CDC is currently sharing data and analysis with the WHO.

- Tue 4 Dec 2018. It isn't crazy to conduct an Ebola clinical trial in a war zone: it's necessary
[STAT News, abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2018/12/04/conducting-ebola-clinical-trial-war-zone/
[Byline: Jeremy Farrar]

The term "randomized controlled trial" conjures up images of sterile, high-tech labs with closely monitored patients hooked up to numerous machines. That's a far cry from the reality of a brave and groundbreaking trial that began last week [week of Mon 26 Nov 2018] in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to investigate lifesaving treatments for Ebola.

The DRC is in the midst of one of the worst Ebola outbreaks it has faced. With at least 245 people killed so far, it is the 2nd-worst Ebola epidemic the world has faced.

This Ebola outbreak is spreading in an incredibly challenging region. It is affecting dense, urban areas, close to national borders, making transmission more likely. And many cases have emerged in extremely hostile and dangerous areas that are under attack from rebel groups and served by bad or nonexistent roads and limited electricity.

This situation puts healthcare workers and communities at risk from both disease and violence. Providing care, gathering data, tracing contacts, and making the vaccine -- the legacy of the West African epidemic -- available in this region is almost impossible. Given these formidable conditions, why attempt a clinical trial?

Several experimental treatments have been given to 174 people infected with Ebola in the DRC under compassionate use. But we don't know which one is the safest and most effective. Determining that can only happen during an outbreak or epidemic, when people have Ebola. Most clinical trials exclude pregnant women and children. That's not the case here. Women and children will be included in the trial because of Ebola's high mortality rate. It's essential that they take part, given recent news that more babies and young children are being diagnosed than in previous outbreaks.

To get enough data, the clinical trials may have to span multiple outbreaks. But once we know if an Ebola treatment can save lives, we can make sure the vaccine or drug is licensed, available, and affordable to those who need it, wherever they are.

Making the decision to go ahead with the trial has not been easy. It is a highly complex undertaking. We should all pay tribute to the brave healthcare workers who are providing the best possible care and conducting this trial.

To date, more than 42 000 people have received the vaccine in the DRC, and not a single vaccinated person has been diagnosed with Ebola. But, as effective as the vaccine may be, it alone will not be enough to keep this deadly disease at bay.

It's time to stop reacting to these outbreaks as discrete episodes and instead work together with a coordinated, nationally led, and internationally supported approach that learns from each outbreak so we can better prepare for the next.

Multi-outbreak, multi-country trials are essential if we're to find the best treatments for patients and the best vaccines. This trial, led by the DRC with the support of the National Institutes of Health; Medecins Sans Frontieres; ALIMA, the African Coalition for Epidemic Research, Response, and Training; the World Health Organization; industry; and others, shows it can be done.

We won't ever get rid of Ebola, but we can stop outbreaks of it from turning into major regional and national epidemics. This trial of treatments, and the vaccines we now have available, offer hope that we can turn this terrifying disease into a preventable and treatable one, ensuring the loss of as few lives as possible.

- Tue 4 Dec 2018. Are we on the cusp of a breakthrough in Ebola treatment?
[The Guardian, abridged, edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/04/ebola-drug-trials-could-lead-patients-treated-home
[Byline: Sarah Bosely]

Ebola could be transformed from a terrifying disease into something that can be managed at home if drug trials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are successful, a leading scientist believes.

Four experimental drugs are starting to be used as part of a groundbreaking trial under extremely difficult conditions in an outbreak in conflict-ridden eastern DRC.

But, says Jeremy Farrar, an infectious diseases expert and the director of the Wellcome Trust, any data gleaned from the use of those drugs will be put together with evidence from future outbreaks in a five-year programme that may lead to effective and licensed treatments. That could take Ebola out of the isolation units where patients are cared for by nurses in masks and allow them to be looked after at home.

"You could turn Ebola from something that really is feared and horrific in communities to something that is preventable and treatable," Farrar said, adding that if a drug could be produced in pill or injection form, "you could start thinking about home care."

And if it could be done for Ebola, he said, the model could be used to find treatments for other diseases such as Nipah and Lassa fever that also manifest in sudden lethal outbreaks.

[Dr Farrar makes a compelling case for conducting clinical trials during acute outbreaks, because that is indeed how we can best identify effective therapeutics to help those who might and will be affected in the future. The healthcare workers who are conducting the current Ebola drug trials in the DRC under incredibly difficult and dangerous circumstances are indeed brave and deserving of our admiration. It may be overly optimistic, however, to project that effective Ebola drugs will obviate the need for seriously ill patients to be cared for "in isolation units by nurses in masks" because such patients will (at least initially) still be infectious and require isolation procedures in order to not infect health care workers, other patients, and family and friends. By analogy, we have effective anti-infective drugs for influenza, meningococcal disease, and Clostridium difficile, but when patients are sick enough with these infections to be hospitalized, we utilize contact, respiratory, or droplet precautions as needed even as we initiate specific treatment. - Mod.LXL]

Take a deadly contagious disease that spreads on contact. Drop it into an area surrounded by jungle, where armed groups vie for control over remote corners. Add a population exhausted by decades of conflict, weary of outsiders, and suspicious of Westerners clad in protective suits erecting camps to treat this illness, camps from which their loved ones often don't come out alive.

I don't think you could think of a more complicated, dangerous place to have an Ebola outbreak than northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.

"... take all that information and imagine it from the point of view of the people living here.

Given this context, the work NGOs like Oxfam, MSF, and ALIMA are doing here is unbelievable, both in treatment and outreach. To be effective in an area like this, you have to talk to the communities, to explain to them what Ebola is, what are the symptoms, what are the treatments, precautions. It's an extremely difficult thing to do given the context of the area.
And finally, there is the treatment itself. The treatment centers are built from scratch. You have doctors, logisticians, and builders who fly in from all over for 2 months at a time. And during those 2 months, they just work around the clock to get these centers up and running as quickly as possible.

They're doing a very difficult job in very difficult conditions, among people, many of whom don't believe in what they're doing."
