Deadly, always fatal, and much feared, chronic wasting disease has now been confirmed in deer roaming both the Gallatin and Paradise valleys, and state wildlife officials are also concerned about a major emerging hotspot for disease along the lower Ruby River.

The arrival of CWD in big game animals around southwest Montana, a prominent part of the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, is certain to cause many to wonder how widespread the illness, which strikes members of the deer family (deer, elk, moose, and caribou) might now actually be.

The fact that an infected white-tailed deer was killed by a hunter within sight of the suburbs of Bozeman is certain to elevate public concern to a whole new level.

During the 1st week of December [2020], Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks revealed that 5 new hunt areas had notched CWD positives for the 1st time. Their locations are the Gallatin, Paradise, and northern Madison valleys east of the Tobacco Roots, as well as an area in the lower Missouri Breaks near Wolf Point and a hunt unit in Beaverhead and Madison counties.

The revelation of greatest immediate worry, officials say, is a cluster of CWD involving whitetails along the lower Ruby River near Sheridan. There, Montana's wildlife agency collected 335 tissue samples from dead deer taken in Hunting District 322, and 78 of those, to date, have tested positive. That's a percentage far above the norm.

To try to slow the infection rate, the state is carrying out a supplemental post-season hunt to knock down whitetail numbers and get a larger sampling size to better gauge CWD's presence there. Reducing ungulate numbers and preventing large concentrations of animals on winter ranges is part of the state's strategy for confronting the disease.

CWD was 1st confirmed in free-ranging big game animals in the state in 2017 with a mule deer shot south of Billings, not far from Montana's border with Wyoming. Since then, 343 tests from more than 16 000 samples have come back positive. The breakdown is 222 whitetails, 118 mule deer, one elk, and 2 moose statewide.

However, the disease 1st raised alarm bells earlier when it was detected in captive game farms in Montana in 1999 and again this year [2020]. (Operating new game farms is forbidden in the state and those still in existence were grandfathered following passage of a citizen initiative.)

Montana's wildlife department spokesman Greg Lemon noted that during 2004 and 2005, Montana made a serious attempt, using federal money, to test harvested big game animals across the state, but CWD then was never confirmed. "We looked as hard as we could but didn't find it," he said.

Wildlife vets tested animals around Phillipsburg where game farm animals had escaped from holding pens, but they, too, turned up negative.

The latest CWD-prevalence map in Montana shows the disease has reached the 4 corners of the state. Experts say people should expect that it also exists everywhere in between. While only recently confirmed in 2017, [CWD] seems to have spread quickly. Or has testing only confirmed what's been here for a while?

[This seems to represent quite an extension of territory from where the disease was previously known to be. When earlier the officials had looked hard for the disease, it was not evident, but it has now reared its ugly head.

This is concerning, as it is near the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA), where there are winter feeding grounds that allow the public to see these animals in the wild and somewhat closer than normal. The feeding grounds also help ensure survival of the animals during the harsh winters in the area. We are likely to hear more in the coming months regarding this apparently large increase in the territory for this disease. - Mod.TG
