Emergence of carbapenem-hydrolyzing metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) in
_Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ has been described worldwide (1). Infection with
MBL-producing strains represents a therapeutic problem, due to their
resistance to all beta-lactams except monobactams. Several types of MBL
enzymes have been identified in _P. aeruginosa_, among which the VIM-type
enzymes appear as the most prevalent in Europe, with more than 12 allelic
variants (1).
VIM-producing _P. aeruginosa_ strains have been associated with nosocomial
outbreaks of _P. aeruginosa_ in France, Italy, Greece, and other European
countries (1-3). We report here the recent emergence and epidemic spread of
VIM-2 producing _P. aeruginosa_ associated with infections acquired in
several Belgian hospitals.
Following the initial detection of MBL-production in Belgian _P.
aeruginosa_ isolates and its reporting in 2004 at national meetings,
carbapenem-resistant isolates from collaborating hospital laboratories were
referred for further characterization of resistance mechanisms. Out of 127
carbapenem-resistant _P. aeruginosa_ isolates analyzed, 86 isolates were
confirmed as VIM-type MBL-producing based on MBL E-test (AB BIODISK, Solna,
Sweden) and PCR for blaVIM gene (4). These isolates were recovered from 86
patients admitted to 8 hospitals located in Brussels and the Walloon Region
of southern Belgium over the period May 2004 to August 2006 (Table 1 [for
table, see original URL - Mod.LL]).
VIM-positive isolates were recovered from rectal swabs (29 per cent),
respiratory specimens (26 per cent), urine (14 per cent), blood (7 per
cent) and other/unspecified specimens (24 per cent). Rectal isolates were
exclusively collected from patients at one single hospital where
surveillance cultures were systematically performed to screen for carriage
of multidrug resistant Gram negative bacilli. 72 (84 per cent) of the
patients colonized or infected with VIM-positive isolates were admitted to
intensive care units (ICUs); 3 were outpatients, and data were not
available for the remaining 11 patients.
All VIM-producing _P. aeruginosa_ isolates showed high-level
cross-resistance to imipenem and meropenem (MICs greater than 256 mg/L).
Co-resistance to other antimicrobial agents was frequently found for
ceftazidime (96 per cent), cefepime (79 per cent), aztreonam (67 per cent),
amikacin (85 per cent), tobramycin (92 per cent), and ciprofloxacin (94 per
cent) but was less commonly present for gentamicin (41 per cent) and
piperacillin-tazobactam (26 per cent). All isolates remained susceptible to
colistin.
Macrorestriction analysis (SpeI) using pulsed field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) as previously described (5) showed 10 PFGE types, among which 4
types (X, Q, W and ZI) were recovered in 2 to 4 hospitals. Sequencing of
the VIM gene showed the presence of blaVIM-2 in PFGE types X, Q, W, ZI, and
ZP isolates (4). The antimicrobial resistance profiles by PFGE type and
hospital are shown in Table 1 [see original URL - Mod.LL].
The 2 most prevalent PFGE types X (n=58 isolates) and Q (n=16 isolates)
were recovered from patients admitted to ICUs of 3 hospitals located in the
Brussels region. PFGE type X isolates were associated with nosocomial
outbreaks in ICUs of hospitals A and H, and they were also recovered in
hospital F (Table 1). PFGE type Q isolates were associated with an ICU
outbreak in hospital B and recovered in hospitals A, D and H, all of which
are either located in Brussels or the Walloon Region. Less frequent PFGE
types had a sporadic distribution (Table 1).
The present study documents the recent emergence and inter-hospital
epidemic spread of VIM 2-type MBL-producing _P. aeruginosa_ strains in
Belgium. Carbapenems are widely used in Belgium to treat hospital-acquired
infections caused by multiresistant Gram negative bacilli. MBL-mediated
carbapenem resistance is recognized with increasing frequency among
multiresistant _P. aeruginosa_ clinical isolates around the world. European
data from EARSS in 2005 have shown a high proportion (25 to greater than 50
per cent) of carbapenem resistance among _P. aeruginosa_ recovered from
blood cultures, especially in eastern Europe (6).
Infections with VIM-type MBL producing _P. aeruginosa_ strains have been
associated with high mortality, and these strains have caused many
nosocomial outbreaks (1-3). Moreover, blaVIM genes are generally located in
class 1 integrons, which carry other resistance determinants including
aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. These integrons can be embedded in
transposons that further enhance their horizontal spread on conjugative
plasmids.
Conclusions
Our findings have practical implications for diagnostic laboratories,
hospital infection control, and public health surveillance systems in
Belgian and neighboring countries, in particular in case of referral of
patients between hospitals. Early detection of MBL-producing _P.
aeruginosa_ is important for adapting antimicrobial therapy and guiding
additional infection control precautions and limiting their hospital
transmission, especially in high risk settings such as critical care.
MBL-mediated carbapenem resistance in _P. aeruginosa_ isolates must be
differentiated from other mechanisms such as overexpression of multidrug
efflux systems and/or porin alterations (1). In our experience, laboratory
tests based on disk diffusion or E-test methods combining the use of
carbapenems with EDTA can accurately detect MBLs in _P. aeruginosa_ (4,7).
Moreover, the rapid spread of 2 MBL-producing _P. aeruginosa_ genotypes in
hospitals of 2 regions underlines the need for setting up national
surveillance studies for these multiresistant pathogens in Belgium.

[The term "drug problem" is used often related illicit drug use, although
it may also refer to issues of inability to obtain appropriate medications
such as antiretroviral medications in the developing world.
"Drug problem," however, can also be used to relate to the impressive
upsurge in the number of bacteria displaying anitmicrobial sensitivity
profiles which provide few therapeutic options. These organisms in the lay
press are often dubbed "superbugs." Not only are more bacteria developing
hard-core resistance patterns (including _Staphylococcus aureus_,
_Enterococcus sp._, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and a host of Gram negative
bacilli like _P. aeruginosa_), but also their overall numbers are
increasing, especially in the hospital setting. This contributes to longer
hospital stays, increased hospital costs and increased morbidity and mortality.
The increase of metallo-beta-lactamase production in _P. aeruginosa_ as
described here is another example of our ride down the slippery slope
towards what some have called the "post-antibiotic era." Modern medicine
has not yet frequently trod into the "pre-antibiotic era," when physicians
stood by the bedside, put a cool cloth on the febrile, dying patient's
forehead and told the soon-to-be-grieving family that "we're doing
everything we can." We may not, however, be far from this. Efforts are
being made to slow down the ride into potential oblivion by increasing use
of more common sense and prudence in the utilization of antimicrobials, by
institution of strictly enforced infection control practices in health care
facilities (particularly hand washing before and after each patient
contact) and by the development of new, uniquely active antimicrobial
compounds by the pharmaceutical industry.
As a clinician who deals with issues of antimicrobial use, misuse, and
resistance on a daily basis, I hope for the best. - Mod.LL]
