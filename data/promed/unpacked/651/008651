Tests for spores have not yet been carried out at the Borders home of a
suspected anthrax victim who died in July from an infection believed to
have been caused by the disease.
Health chiefs have been formulating a safe plan to enter the house and
workshops at Stobs, near Hawick, where animal skins might be stored. NHS
Borders has been trying to identify the most appropriate method of
obtaining samples from the sealed site. A spokesman said a controlled
opening and entry of the property would be carried out in the next few weeks.
"This will be carried out by external experts commissioned by NHS Borders
who will take appropriate samples for testing and analysis," he said. "The
incident team is currently preparing an action plan that will deal with all
appropriate issues."
A total of 162 people have now been traced and checked via a special
helpline set up after the incident. About 74 of them have been offered
precautionary antibiotics.

The victim's friends held a wake in his apartment, and this may explain why
so many people are now undergoing precautionary antibiotic treatment. Les
Kumor reminded me that the Canadians had had a similar instance in
Vancouver associated with drum hides. - Mod.MHJ]
