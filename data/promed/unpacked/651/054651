Fatal bat syndrome spreads in Vermont
-------------------------------------
An illness that state biologists believe is killing off the bat
population is spreading north.

Ryan Smith, a biologist with the Vermont Department of Fish and
Wildlife, said Wednesday [3 Feb 2010] that white nose syndrome (WNS)
was first discovered in Vermont 2 years ago, in Dorset. "Although
reports are concentrated around Johnson at this time, we are also
receiving scattered reports from other sections of the state," he
said. "Unfortunately, WNS has continued to spread north, and we
expect to receive more reports of abnormal bat activity from the
northern half of the state. Last winter [2008-09] reports were
concentrated in southern Vermont, but bat populations there have been
devastated over the past 2 winters."

Smith said that the current theory is that the bats are being
infected with a fungus that irritates them into waking up more often
while they are hibernating. He said the bats then burn through their
winter fat reserves faster than they should, and die. He said that a
bat normally wakes up every 2 weeks during the winter, but with WNS,
it's closer to every 4 or 5 days.

The public is still being asked to report sightings of dead bats or
unusual bat behavior, such as flying in the daytime or on warm,
winter days. Such behavior is often a symptom of WNS. "As a result,
people living near some caves or mines are seeing increasing activity
and mortality in these animals. Some are finding dead bats on their
porches or window screens, observing bats flying in the day, or
having bats enter their houses," said Scott Darling, the state
biologist at the head of the WNS study.

Smith said that he spoke with homeowners Wednesday [3 Feb 2010] who
reside in Johnson, who reported roughly 2-dozen dead bats on their
porch over the last week.

He said that while the state continues to monitor the problem,
serious studies have been hampered by a lack of funding. "Funding is
still the major issue with it," he said, adding that biologists still
aren't sure how the fungus relates to bat mortality or if the fungus
is spread from bat to bat or is part of the cave environment. Smith
said that bats from Wisconsin have been imported to a cave where the
bat population was wiped out to see if the bats will contract WNS. He
said that the study is still ongoing and the idea is to see if the
problem comes from the cave or other bats. Smith said that biologists
hope that the fungus is spread from bat to bat, otherwise some method
of cleaning the caves will have to be devised. He said that New York
is currently experimenting with spraying caves with a fungicide in
order to halt the progress of the syndrome. Should that method prove
to work, Vermont may consider it.

The disease was first documented at the Howe Caverns, in central New
York, Smith said. Because the caverns are open to the public, one
theory is that the fungus was brought in from Europe by human foot
traffic. Smith said that European bats infected with the fungus have
not suffered like the ones in the United States, although no one
knows why [see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100108.0091]. "If this goes
unchecked we could very well see bat extinction in the Northeast,"
Smith said, adding that dead bats have not been reported in areas
that were hit hard. "We aren't seeing the mortality this year [2010],
which isn't really a good sign. It indicates that they were wiped out
over the 2 years."

The department is asking people to not attempt to rehabilitate sick
bats. Darling said that bats leaving caves are too emaciated to be
helped by anything short of intensive care by trained professionals
and there is a danger of spreading the illness by moving the bats. He
said that people should continue to report sick or dead bats to the department.
