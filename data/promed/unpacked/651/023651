The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 23 Jan 2020:
- Since the start of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 3416, of which 3297 are confirmed and 119 probable. In total, there were 2240 deaths (2121 confirmed and 119 probable) and 1142 people healed;
- 547 suspected cases under investigation;
- No new confirmed cases;
- 1 new death from confirmed cases, of which no community death was recorded; 1 death from confirmed cases in the Ebola treatment center (ETC) in North Kivu in Mabalako;
- 1 healed person leaving ETC Nord Kivu in Beni;
- No health worker is among the new confirmed cases. The cumulative number of confirmed/probable cases among health workers is 167 (approximately 5% of all confirmed/probable cases), including 41 deaths.

News
The General Coordinator of the response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic, Prof. Steve Ahuka Mundeke, chaired this Fri 24 Jan 2020, in the presence of the provincial Minister of Health of North Kivu and partners, the endorsement workshop of the Strategic Plan for the response to the Ebola virus disease epidemic 4.1 (SRP4.1) in the Provinces of North and South Kivu, as well as of Ituri;
- The SRP4.1 endorsement workshop revolved around 2 recommendations from the SRP4 Mid-Term Review, namely, the finalization of inventories of materials and equipment used in the response and that on financial reporting by the Coleads and NGOs. It should be noted that the recommendations of the SRP4 Mid-Term Review were 66.7% completed;
- Discussions from these meetings resulted from the following 5 recommendations: sharing the Ministry of Health's decree on the scale with all stakeholders and the timetable for the development of operational action plans of the sub-coordination units, the institutional analysis of the Provincial Health Divisions (DPS), the harmonization of the budget for SRP4.1 activities planned by the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) and the inclusion in the budget estimate of the rationalization of human resources and the application of the revised premium bonus scale for service providers;
- This workshop, which took place in the meeting room of the Karibu Hotel, headquarters of the General Coordination of the response, in Goma, capital of the province of North Kivu, was attended by members of the General Coordination, the representative of donors, Coleads, international NGOs, Congolese government experts involved in the response.

Vaccination
- A total of 7611 people were vaccinated, as of 22 Jan 2020, with the 2nd vaccine Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo (Johnson & Johnson) in the 2 health areas from Karisimbi to Goma;
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018 with the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, 273 837 people have been vaccinated.

Surveillance at entry points
- Since the start of the epidemic, the total number of travelers checked (temperature taken) at health checkpoints has been 142 573 962.

[2] Opinion

https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/new-ebola-vaccine-four-priorities-by-ifeanyi-m-nsofor-2020-01
[Byline: Ifeanyi M. Nsofor]

The Ervebo vaccine is a great stride forward in global health. But while it will save lives, it should not be viewed as a magic bullet for preventing and addressing future Ebola outbreaks. Above all, international donors must work closely with African governments and national public health institutes to ensure that the vaccine can be delivered to everyone who needs it.

When the US Food and Drug Administration approved the new Ebola vaccine Ervebo [rVSV-ZEBOV; Merck] last month [December 2019], I was elated. Ervebo can generate a quick immune response after a single dose, with protection occurring within 10 days. If only such a vaccine had existed a few years ago, I thought.

Open societies have not always needed defending in the determined way that they do today. But the tide turned against them after the 2008 global financial crisis, and, more than a decade later, the threat posed by authoritarian nationalism continues to rise.

In 2015, I co-led an African Union (AU)-commissioned evaluation by EpiAFRIC of the AU's efforts to address the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. For 2 weeks, my team and I traveled throughout the 3 countries, interviewing AU volunteers, community members, international partners, senior managers at health ministries, and other stakeholders who worked to stem that outbreak. We also visited a Coyah Ebola treatment center in Guinea.

During our evaluation, we saw the devastation caused by Ebola, and how weak health systems in the 3 worst-affected countries had enabled the infection to spread like wildfire. By the time we had finished our interviews, it was clear to us that a stronger health system could have prevented the outbreak and could even have helped to stop it once it had begun. We wished there was an Ebola vaccine.

Now, there is one.

Without doubt, Ervebo could be a game changer in tackling future Ebola outbreaks. But, in order to help protect health workers and communities, the vaccine must be delivered safely, sustainably, and equitably. That seems unlikely in many countries where Ebola is endemic, owing to security, systemic, and social challenges. Unless these challenges are addressed, Ervebo won't be effective.

First, without security, Ervebo will effectively be unavailable. The recent deaths of health workers in Africa, and the derailment and episodic suspension of the Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), underline why security is imperative in healthcare delivery.

In April 2019, for example, Richard Mouzoko, a World Health Organization epidemiologist, was killed in an attack on the Butembo University Hospital in the DRC. In 2013, 9 female vaccinators engaged in the global polio eradication initiative were killed in 2 separate shootings at health centers in Kano, northwest Nigeria. The Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria's northeast has derailed polio eradication efforts and set back the country's prospects of being declared free of the disease.

Governments must therefore strengthen national security and work closely with health professionals and security agencies to ensure that health workers and community members are not put in harm's way.

Second, governments must invest in detecting, preventing, and responding to infectious disease outbreaks. According to <preventepidemics.org>, a website that ranks countries' epidemic preparedness, no African country currently has the optimal "ready score" of least 80% on a WHO-supported Joint External Evaluation (JEE) to perform these tasks. The 5 countries that have experienced Ebola outbreaks in the last 6 years are the DRC (with a ready score of 35%), Guinea (35%), Sierra Leone (43%), Liberia (46%), and Nigeria (46%). This illustrates the huge challenges that lie ahead: If a country cannot efficiently detect, prevent, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks, how can it know when and where to deploy Ervebo or other vaccines?

Third, it is never too early to explain Ervebo's benefits to communities before the vaccine is needed. Such efforts should be led by national public health institutes, working with subnational ministries of health and local government health departments. This is an area in which donors can invest because it amounts to money well spent. Waiting until another Ebola outbreak occurs may delay delivery of the vaccines. Furthermore, past experience has shown that communities have little trust in Ebola interventions in the midst of an outbreak.

Community engagement should also include risk communication, which involves explaining to communities how Ebola is transmitted and what they can do to help prevent outbreaks. The University of Global Health Equity in Rwanda says that "achieving equity in health care depends on equity in health education." This should be the global health community's mantra. We should never assume that people know enough about Ebola and other deadly diseases.

Finally, we must focus more on the social determinants of health. These factors are usually not considered to be part of the health sector, but they have serious implications for health and health-seeking behaviors. For example, access to clean water and the availability of good sanitation in Ebola-prone communities are vital to preventing and responding to outbreaks and stopping the spread of infection.

Yet, according to the WHO, compared with developed countries, 38% of healthcare facilities in low- and middle-income countries lack access to an improved drinking-water source, 19% do not have adequate sanitation, and 35% lack water and soap for handwashing. When health workers cannot wash their hands in clean running water after seeing a patient, they are at greater risk of being infected and of transmitting infections to other patients.

The Ervebo vaccine is a great stride forward in global health. But while it will save lives, it should not be viewed as a magic bullet for preventing and addressing future Ebola outbreaks. Above all, international donors must work closely with African governments and national public health institutes to ensure that the vaccine can be delivered to everyone who needs it.

[An insightful article raising important points on the situation in the DRC and elsewhere that prevents vaccines from being the end-all solution to pathogen transmission not only in the DRC but also equally in other low- and middle-income countries, especially those where there is social or political unrest. The vaccines, now 2, used in the DRC, as well as the tireless healthcare workers, are thankfully making significant headway in protecting the population from Ebola, but cannot completely prevent disease without other measures being taken to improve security, public health infrastructure, communication to build trust, access to clean water, among others. - Mod.LK
