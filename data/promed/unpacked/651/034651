One mule was euthanized after a presumptive positive for EIA and other animals are under quarantine. The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services notified the Equine Disease Communication Center on [Wed 13 Mar 2019] of one case of equine infectious anemia (EIA) in Transylvania County. The case was in a mule that was euthanized.

The mule displayed clinical signs and at necropsy had histopathological changes consistent with EIA. Additional blood from the animal was not available for testing for EIA, so out of an abundance of caution, the case is considered presumptive positive by animal regulatory health officials.

The remaining equids at the facility were tested and were negative for EIA and will be observed and retested in 60 days.

[Unfortunately, there is no vaccine for this disease. It is a very sad disease, and, in most states, regulated with strict quarantine issued for the life of the horse, or euthanasia. Perhaps we will have a vaccine someday, or dare we dream for no insects capable of transmitting this and other diseases?

"Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a non-contagious, infectious disease of horses and other Equidae. It is caused by an RNA virus classified in the _Lentivirus_ genus, family Retroviridae. EIA can present as an acute, subacute, or chronic infection. On occasion, the virus can be a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. The most frequently encountered form of the disease is the unapparent, chronically infected carrier." This chronic carrier state is the reason for some of the regulations when equids go to a show or event or are shipped for any reason.

"Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of EIA is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily bloodborne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and, to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host-defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal.

"No specific treatment or safe and effective vaccine is available. Because equids infected with EIA virus present the only known source of infection, antibody-positive animals should be kept at a safe distance (around 200 m [219 yd]) from other equids. The only recognized exception to this rule is the progeny of seropositive mares, which may possess maternal antibodies to the virus after ingesting colostrum. In most cases, passive antibody against EIA virus wanes and is no longer detectable in the Coggins test by 6-8 months of age; detectable antibody may persist up to 12 months, however, if ELISA testing is used."
