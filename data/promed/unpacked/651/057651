Authorities have revealed that 288 horses at a Texas property have
tested positive for the disease, equine piroplasmosis.

Testing has also revealed the presence of 2 types of ticks known to be
capable of transmitting the blood-borne protozoa, _Theileria equi_,
which is behind the outbreak.

The announcement this week that 2 horses in New Jersey bought from the
ranch in 2008 have also tested positive for the disease indicates it
may have been present on the property for some months.

The US Department of Agriculture's latest report to the World
Organization for Animal Health [OIE], dated 4 Nov 2009, said a
comprehensive investigation was being carried out by the department's
Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the Texas Animal
Health Commission (TAHC). It said all horses on the property, which is
in Kleberg County, remain under quarantine.

"_Anocentor nitens_ & _Dermacentor variabilis_, vectors known to be
competent for transmitting equine piroplasmosis, were identified among
ticks collected from multiple horses," said Dr John Clifford, a
veterinarian who is deputy administrator for APHIS. Additional
testing of ticks and species identification work was ongoing, he said.
"Testing of all additional horses located on the index ranch, and of
other epidemiologically linked horses, is ongoing."

The 1st confirmed case on the ranch was 19 Oct 2009. Control measures
being used involve control of ticks, quarantine, disinfection, and
dipping and spraying.

Equine piroplasmosis is a notifiable disease in the US, and horses
entering the country are screened for it.

In June 2009, the disease was detected in Missouri, with a related
case found in Kansas. In 2008, the disease was detected in Florida,
which was then the 1st occurrence of the disease in the US in 20 years
[It may have been the 1st appearance in Florida in 20 years, but
certainly not in the US, as Indiana had the disease in 2004. -
Mod.TG]. Those cases have been resolved.

The disease can affect horses, donkeys, mules and zebras. It causes
clinical signs common to many diseases, including poor appetite and
weight loss. Deaths can occur. It is distributed worldwide but
appears to be absent from the Pacific region, where it has not been
reported since 1976 (Australia).

New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Douglas H. Fisher today [10 Nov
2009] asked veterinarians and horse owners to watch their horses,
donkeys and mules for signs of equine piroplasmosis, a disease
transmitted to the animals by ticks and from horse to horse by
contaminated needles.

Once infected, an equine can take 7-22 days to show signs of the
illness. Signs include fever, anemia, jaundiced mucous membranes,
swollen abdomens, and labored breathing. Infected horses also may have
roughened hair coats, constipation and colic.

In milder form, the disease can cause equines to appear weak and show
lack of appetite.

Equine piroplasmosis is a reportable disease; therefore, anyone with
knowledge of the existence or suspected existence of the disease must
report this information to the Department of Agriculture within 48
hours at (609) 292-3965.

At this time, 2 of 4 New Jersey horses purchased from an infected herd
in Texas in 2008 have tested positive for the disease. Additional
testing on the imported horses and contact horses is underway.

Quarantines have been placed on the affected premises and precautions
implemented to prevent the spread of this disease to other horses.

Vets and horse owners in New Jersey have been asked to keep a lookout
for the tick-borne disease equine piroplasmosis after testing revealed
2 horses brought into the state have the infection.

The state's agriculture secretary, Douglas Fisher, said 4 horses
purchased from a Texas herd subsequently found to be infected with the
disease were brought into the state.

"At this time, 2 of 4 New Jersey horses purchased from an infected
herd in Texas in 2008 have tested positive for the disease," Fisher
said.

The fact the horses were bought in 2008 suggests some of the 101
horses so far identified in Kleberg County, Texas with the disease may
have been harboring it for some time. [Report [1] above gives 288
positives.- Mod.JW] "Additional testing on the imported horses and
contact horses is underway," Fisher said.

[Readers are encouraged to see ProMED-mail post 20091021.3617 for
information about the disease.

Ectoparasites are responsible for a number of different diseases and
over the years have become resistant to many pesticides. This disease
and the tick that caries it are one such example. It behooves everyone
with animals to be on the lookout for ticks. Ticks like certain
places, such as ears, tails, heads, genital regions, the mid belly,
and mid back. Those are places an animal has a hard time scratching
but is easy for a tick to get a blood meal. There are other places
where ticks can be found, but those are often good areas to start a
search. Remember, ticks can be tiny, so look carefully. - Mod.TG]
