Potato deforming mosaic disease is caused by an isolate of Tomato yellow
vein streak virus

Pelotas, RS, Brazil; and A.C. de Avila (Inoue-Nagata) Accepted for
publication 8 Sep 2005.
The disease known as potato deforming mosaic was first reported in the
1980's in Southern Brazil (Daniels & Castro, 1985). Symptoms of mosaic with
leaf distortion were seen in infected potato plants and a virus was
suggested as the causal pathogen. In this study, we have characterised the
causal agent of this disease by transmission experiments and molecular
analysis of the viral genome.
The original virus isolate was collected from a potato plant in 1983 in the
State of Rio Grande do Sul and maintained through vegetative propagation in
the greenhouse. The virus was easily transmitted from potato by the
whitefly _Bemisia tabaci_ biotype B causing mottling, chlorotic spots and
leaf distortion on tomato, vein-banding and mosaic on _Nicotiana
benthamiana_ and vein-clearing on _Nicandra physaloides_. These properties
are consistent with the disease agent being a geminivirus.
PCR amplification using primers CP2 (5'cccctgcagaacttccaagtctggacg3') and
PAL1v1978 (Rojas et al., 1993) produced a DNA A derived fragment of 1.8 Kb
encoding the entire coat protein gene, common region and part of the AC1
gene. Sequence comparison showed highest identity (97.3 percent) to Tomato
yellow vein streak virus (ToYVSV-U79998), a virus previously described in
tomatoes in Brazil (Faria et al., 1997). The presence of a B component was
confirmed by PCR with primers B1200F 5'CCCCTGCAGTAYTAYTGYTGGATGTC3') and
B1900R (5'cccctgcagrtgyaacatwgatctcc3'); with amplification of a fragment
of approximately 800nt comprising the 3' end of the BV1 gene, the small
intergenic region and the 5' half of the BC1 gene.
Our results indicate that the potato deforming mosaic and tomato yellow
vein streak diseases are caused by the same geminivirus, belonging to the
genus _Begomovirus_. Potato deforming mosaic disease was described more
than 20 years ago but was of little economical relevance (Daniels & Castro,
1985). Since then this virus, now named Tomato yellow vein streak virus
(ToYVSV), has re-emerged and is currently the major begomovirus affecting
tomatoes and potatoes in the state of Sao Paulo (Souza-Dias et al., 2003).
This is the 1st record of natural infection of ToYVSV in potato.

[It is interesting that it took over 20 years to recognize that ToYVSV and
Potato yellow deforming virus were one and the same virus. In potato, the
apical leaves showed yellow or green mottle which developed into leaf
distortion with yellow blotches (apparently no natural infection have been
found on potato). About 20 percent of young tomato plants showed virus
symptoms. Tomato is an important crop in the EPPO region, and both indoor
and outdoor and the virus vector is present in many parts of the EPPO
region. The disease appears so far, limited in Brazil but data is lacking
about its extent and severity. It is not known whether potato can be
naturally infected
