New tests for anthrax negative
------------------------------
U.S. military officials said last night [15 Mar 2005] that they were
confident that there is no public health threat at mail rooms at the
Pentagon and a Fairfax County office complex, because a series of
tests performed yesterday all came back negative for deadly anthrax
bacteria.
Based on a positive overnight test on material from the Pentagon,
public health and postal officials acted throughout the day on the
assumption that the capital region faced an anthrax threat for the
1st time since 2001. But analysis of more than 70 samples
subsequently taken from filters, surfaces and machines at both mail
rooms showed no trace of anthrax bacteria, living or dead.
A senior military official said investigators are concentrating on
the possibility that the sample from the Pentagon actually was
contaminated at a contractor's laboratory in Richmond. The material,
a swab taken from a filter on a biohazard detector, was then passed
on to Army scientists at Fort Detrick on Monday [14 Mar 2005]. They
confirmed the positive finding early yesterday [15 Mar 2005].
"The probability is low to very low that we're dealing with a true
health threat," said William Winkenwerder Jr., assistant secretary of
defense for health affairs.
Still, federal and local health officials recommended that those
already advised to take antibiotics keep taking them, pending final
test results.
The nation's 1st bioterrorism attack [in 2001] led to wholesale
changes in the handling of government mail near Washington and new
emergency protocols for the Postal Service and public health
officials. Many of those protocols worked this week, authorities
said. But Fairfax and Virginia officials were angry that the Pentagon
had not alerted them to a potential threat. And postal workers
remained wary of the official response.
Government officials expressed alarm that familiar problems of
coordination and information-sharing, originating chiefly at the
Pentagon, added to the confusion and delayed the ability of postal
officials, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and
Virginia and District health officials to respond by as much as a day
or more.
"There is a concern that [the Department of Homeland Security], which
has a key role in these types of incidents under the incident
management system, was not alerted," a Bush administration official
said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the
criticism. "Once alerted, DHS, in coordination with the FBI, [Health
and Human Services Department] and CDC began initiating a response
coordinated with state and local agencies."
U.S. Rep. James P. Moran Jr. (Virginia Democrat), who represents the
areas around both facilities, and Sen. John W. Warner (Virginia
Republican), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, asked the
Pentagon to explain its response. "We need to hear what the
explanation is," Moran said. Bryan Whitman, a top Pentagon spokesman,
said the department followed its playbook and notified local
officials in Arlington. "The department acted very aggressively,"
Whitman said. He said the event would allow Pentagon officials "to
evaluate our procedures and decide whether or not we can improve them
from an incident management standpoint."
But even at the Pentagon, there was concern that some procedures were
not followed properly. Workers did not hold up delivery of an
estimated 8000 pieces of mail that flowed Thursday and Friday [10-11
Mar 2005] throughout the building. Standard procedure requires mail
to be held until daily tests are completed, and military officials
said complacency might have played a role after years of negative
results.
The incident began before 10:30 a.m. Monday [14 Mar 2005], when a
defense contractor responsible for daily biohazard monitoring at the
Pentagon mail room reported a positive alert for anthrax from a
sensor filter sampled Thursday [10 Mar 2005]. The facility, which
also handles food and other deliveries to the Pentagon, was
shuttered; 263 employees submitted swab samples to medical personnel,
and Arlington emergency crews were called.
At about 2:30 p.m., at the Baileys Crossroads complex, which receives
mail from the Pentagon facility 4 miles away, a sensor gave an alert
in an 8th-floor mail room at Skyline Five Place. About 800 workers
were locked down in 3 buildings for almost 6 hours. Dozens were
decontaminated, and workers who had left were told to wash exposed
skin, jewelry and eyeglasses and to seal their clothing in a plastic
bag.
Pentagon officials said they are continuing to investigate but have
found no connection between the alerts at the 2 facilities, calling
the situation an apparent coincidence. Defense officials are working
with Fairfax County and the FBI to determine when the buildings may
reopen, pending additional tests.
The test that produced the confirmed positive finding of anthrax was
performed by the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious
Diseases at Fort Detrick and was completed at about 4 a.m. yesterday
[15 Mar 2005], a top military official said. The polymerase chain
reaction test is accurate to "very, very close" to 100 percent in
confirming the presence of the molecular signature of anthrax
bacteria, he said. But all subsequent lab culture tests used to
determine whether there were any live or viable bacteria were
negative.
Officials said the Pentagon incident did not bear the signature of
the 2001 attacks, when anthrax spores were found in more than 2/3rds
of tests at mail facilities in Brentwood and New Jersey. Authorities
have not recovered any mail believed to have triggered the sensors,
and they said there were no threats to lend credence to a possible
attack. That, coupled with the many negative test results, provided
federal officials with the confidence to say there was no health risk.

Anthrax scare at Pentagon false alarm
-------------------------------------
The anthrax scare at the Pentagon was a false alarm. Initial tests
indicated the deadly spores might be present at 2 Pentagon mail
facilities. The latest test came back negative. Testing continues
Wednesday [16 Mar 2005] morning, but military officials say they are
confident there is no public threat.
Hundreds of postal workers took antibiotics. 3 mail facilities in
Washington shut down. The White House was on alert, all because of an
apparent mix-up at a military lab.
Government officials now say it does not appear that the mail
facility next to the Pentagon or any other mail rooms were
contaminated with anthrax.

AP reported that a sample of anthrax, which was kept for comparison
purposes, may have gotten mixed up with the samples taken from the
mail offices.
"We have no evidence that there was anthrax material in the mail,"
said William Winkenwerder, assistant secretary of defense for health
affairs. "We had some preliminary results that were positive, but
subsequent additional tests have determined that the sample that we
had was in fact negative."

Anthrax worries not over in Virginia
------------------------------------
"We're talking 2 different incidences," said Merni Fitzgerald,
spokeswoman for the National Capitol Region Joint Information Center.
"There are 2 different things: the Pentagon and Skyline." Anthrax
tests at U.S. Defense Department office buildings in Fairfax,
Virginia are not complete, and the buildings will remain closed, a
spokeswoman said today [16 Mar 2005].
Some 70 tests done since Monday [14 Mar 2005] have cleared anthrax
worries at the Pentagon, located in Arlington, Virginia, but results
were not in from tests at the separate Department of Defense-leased
Skyline office buildings to the west in Fairfax County.
"We're talking 2 different incidences," said Merni Fitzgerald,
spokeswoman for the National Capitol Region Joint Information Center.
"There are 2 different things: the Pentagon and Skyline," Fitzgerald
told United Press International. "The protocols are on a different
time line because the Pentagon incident was earlier. At the Pentagon,
the testing is completed and results were negative. The Skyline
protocol is continuing, and there are still tests pending at Skyline."
Fitzgerald said the Skyline buildings would remain closed until
testing and protocols are completed. "At that point, the Fairfax
County health director will make a decision about the status of the
buildings," she said. "Of course, that will be based on the results
of the testing and the protocols. I cannot really predict when the
tests will come back."

[Now the finger-pointing starts, and folk grab facts that support
their assumptions and presumptions. From these reports, I note the
following: "...10:30 a.m. Monday [14 Mar 2005], when a defense
contractor responsible for daily biohazard monitoring at the Pentagon
mail room reported a positive alert for anthrax from a sensor filter
sampled Thursday [10 Mar 2005]; and "...but analysis of more than 70
samples subsequently taken from [Pentagon facility] filters, surfaces
and machines at both mail rooms showed no trace of anthrax bacteria,
living or dead." At some point, a _B. anthracis_ product apparently
entered the testing system. "The test that produced the confirmed
positive finding of anthrax was performed by the U.S. Army Medical
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick and
completed at about 4 a.m. yesterday [15 Mar 2005], a top military
official said. The polymerase chain reaction test is accurate to
"very, very close" to 100 percent in confirming the presence of the
molecular signature of anthrax bacteria, he said. But all subsequent
lab culture tests, used to determine whether there were any live or
viable bacteria, were negative." Note, this does not state that they
did not find dead _B. anthracis_. On the other hand, if this had been
a repeat of the 2001 incidents, there would have been no lack of
positive samples, alive or dead. At this time, there is no public
information on the nature of the various tests run.
And let us take comfort from the fact that liaison screw-ups
apparently continued, which means that no one will be sitting back
complacent that "the system" works. But, in the end, it is the
responsibility of those on the sand in the arena who have to make the
decisions. The rest of us must watch and learn from the event. And, in your
prayers, remember my friend John Ezell and his staff at USAMRIID, who will
be the subject of intense scrutiny. There, but for the grace of God, go many
of us. - Mod.MHJ]
[There must be something wrong with the reported test time line: "...10:30
a.m. Monday [14 Mar 2005], when a defense contractor responsible for daily
biohazard monitoring at the Pentagon mail room reported a positive alert for
anthrax from a sensor filter sampled Thursday [10 Mar 2005]." Is it a fact
that the mail room is not used on Friday through Sunday, and employees do
not report to work until after 10:30 a.m. Monday, so such test results will
give timely warning? - Mod.JW]
