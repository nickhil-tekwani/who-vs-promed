The Bali administration will soon launch an island-wide sterilization
campaign targeting pet and stray dogs both to control the numbers of
the animal, which is known to be the primary carrier of rabies, as
well as to contain the spread of the deadly disease.

Rabies experts agree that the ideal size of dog population on the
resort island should be somewhere between 150 000 and 200 000.
Currently, the dog population has reached more than 300 000.

"We will start the campaign this year [2011]," provincial animal
husbandry agency head Putu Sumantra said, adding that sterilization is
one of several key measures in the island's battle to regain its free
rabies status.

"We are optimistic that Bali will be able to regain that status by the
end of 2012. By that time, the island will aim to record no new rabies
cases, either human or animal," he stressed.

Bringing the dog population down to a manageable size is critical in
the island's future efforts to prevent and contain a rabies epidemic,
he said.

However, the agency has yet to decide upon the specific method of
sterilization that will be employed in the campaign. Presently, the
available methods range from surgical intervention, such as neutering
and spaying, to non-surgical methods, such as implanting a
testosterone-suppressing substance and injecting a contraceptive
drug.

The rabies outbreak started late-2008 in 2 villages in south Bali and
quickly spread to every region on the island. "The epidemic has
claimed at least 132 lives and the government has poured billions of
rupiah into containing it," Sumantra said.

Mitigation efforts have yielded several positive results. A mass
vaccination drive has succeeded in reaching 79 percent of the dog
population and another drive is scheduled next November [2011]. The
number of rabies cases in dogs has also decreased significantly; in
2010, out of 3300 dog brain samples tested, 144 were positive for
rabies.

"This year, out of 2311 samples tested, only 67 were found to be
positive. The sample's size is smaller because the number of dogs
displaying rabies symptoms was also smaller," he added.

At the peak of the epidemic, rabies infected 273 villages across the
island. Presently, of that number, 174 villages have recorded no new
cases during the last 12 months.

[The reported improvement in the rabies situation in Bali is
encouraging. As underlined in the conclusions of the recently held
global conference on rabies control (Seoul, 7-9 Sep 2011), all
successful rabies eradication programmes have included measures
combining stray dog population control and vaccination of all dogs
having owners.
