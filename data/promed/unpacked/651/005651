Unidentified Virus Infection Hits Karas Region in Namibia
---------------------------------------------------------
A total of 90 people, most of them schoolchildren, have been treated
at the Keetmanshoop State Hospital for a yet unidentified virus
infection. The patients complained of headaches, runny noses, sore
throats, fever and coughing, according to Keetmanshoop primary health
supervisor Rauna Namukwambi.

Namukwambi said health officials had taken 6 samples to test whether
it is H1N1 [influenza] virus infection, but only one of the results
has been received and it was negative. "We're still waiting for the
outcome of the remaining samples," she said. Namukwambi said the
affected people, of whom 6 were admitted to the hospital for one-day
close observation, were given medical treatment according to their symptoms.

She urged the public not to panic, adding that the situation is under
control. Namukwambi advised that people should take care of basic
hygiene such as washing hands to avoid any virus infection,

Similar cases were reported at Bethanie, Berseba and Aroab.
Namukwambi said health officials will visit all schools in and around
Keetmanshoop to treat ill children.

[This outbreak of undiagnosed illness among schoolchildren in the
Karas region of Namibia does not correspond to any of the infections
reported during the past year in Namibia (see the ProMED-mail see
also list, below). The illnesses are assumed to be virus infections
and appear to be relatively mild, short-lived and non-specific. Any
of a variety of childhood infections could be responsible. Influenza
virus infection has been suspected, but (the pandemic) H1N1-type
virus has been excluded. Further information is awaited.
