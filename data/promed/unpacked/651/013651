[1] Additional product recall, factory closed

A Kinder chocolate factory in Belgium has been ordered to close after it was linked to dozens of salmonella cases. Belgium's food safety authority has also ordered the recall of all Kinder products made at the factory in Arlon, which is owned by Ferrero. Suspected salmonellosis cases linked to Kinder chocolate have been reported in countries including the UK, Germany, France and Belgium. Ferrero has apologized and acknowledged "internal failures".

Belgium's food safety authority, the AFSCA (Agence Fédérale pour la Sécurité de la Chaîne alimentaire), said the factory was ordered to shut after Ferrero was unable to provide complete information for its investigation. The AFSCA said the investigation was ongoing and the factory would only be allowed to reopen if Ferrero could provide the necessary guarantees that it complied with food safety regulations.

Belgian agriculture minister David Clarinval said: "Such a decision is never taken lightly, but the current circumstances make it necessary. The food security of our citizens can never be neglected." The recall includes all Kinder Surprise, Kinder Surprise Maxi, Kinder Mini Eggs and Kinder Schokobons products. The AFSCA has also asked companies to remove the products from their shelves and advised people not to eat them.

On Thursday [7 Apr 2022], Ferrero recalled some of its Kinder chocolates from shops in the USA over concerns about potential salmonella contamination. Earlier this week, a number [of] Kinder Surprise chocolate egg products were also recalled in the UK. All the sweets affected had been made in the same Belgian factory.

Some Kinder chocolates have also been recalled in parts of Asia, including Hong Kong and Singapore. Ferrero has previously described the recalls as "precautionary" and said none of its Kinder products released for sale had tested positive for salmonella. It came after more than 60 people in the UK, mostly young children, became infected with salmonella in an outbreak linked to Kinder Surprise eggs.

On Wednesday [6 Apr 2022], Europe's health agency said it was also looking into dozens of suspected cases of salmonellosis linked with eating chocolate in at least 9 countries, including the UK, Germany, France and Belgium. It did not mention Ferrero or any other confectioner in a statement, but warned that the reported cases were mostly among children under 10.

Italian confectionary group Ferrero has voluntarily recalled some of its Kinder chocolates from the American shelves for a potential link with salmonella contamination.

Kinder Happy Moments Chocolate Assortment and Kinder Mix Chocolate Treats basket are being recalled because they were manufactured in a facility where salmonella was detected, Ferrero North America said on Thursday [7 Apr 2022]. The voluntary recall comes after Ferrero recalled its Kinder Surprise chocolate eggs from UK stores earlier this week, adding that the affected chocolate was manufactured in Belgium and the recall may be extended to other countries. "While there are no reports of illness in the USA to date, Ferrero is voluntarily recalling the products out of an abundance of caution due to reported cases of salmonellosis in consumers that consumed products in Europe that were manufactured at the same facility," the statement said.

Probable or confirmed cases of salmonellosis linked with eating chocolates has been found in Britain, France, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Sweden and Norway.

[3] Canada recall
Date: Wed 6 Apr 2022

https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2022/04/kinder-chocolate-eggs-other-products-recalled-in-canada-because-of-link-to-multi-country-salmonella-outbreak/


Ferrero Canada Ltd is recalling certain Kinder brand chocolate products because of possible salmonella contamination. The products have been linked to a multi-country outbreak in Europe. The recalled products have been sold nationally in Canada, according to the recall notice posted by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. As of the posting of the recall notice today [6 Apr 2022], no one in Canada has been reported infected in connection with the recalled products.

More than 100 children in the UK and Europe have been infected in the salmonella outbreak. Multiple Kinder brand products are under recall in Europe and the UK. There is concern that consumers in Canada may have the recalled products in their home because their expiration dates reach into November [2022]. The recalled products in Canada can be found at https://bit.ly/3v4puAP.

More products are now being recalled, and the recall has spread to North America and Asia. The organism found here is a monophasic form of _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium. Typhimurium (4,[5],12:i:1,2) is the most frequently isolated serovar in cases of salmonellosis in Europe, and its monophasic variant (4,[5],12:i:-) has been increasingly responsible for salmonellosis outbreaks in humans. Monophasic _S._ Typhimurium has the Typhimurium O somatic antigens but not a complete set of flagellar (H) antigens.

The source of the contamination in this chocolate product is not clear. Chocolate is not a common vehicle for the transmission of salmonellosis but is not unknown -- see, for example, this report by Werber and colleagues: (Werber D, Dreesman J, Feil F, et al: International outbreak of _Salmonella_ Oranienburg due to German chocolate. BMC Infect Dis. 2005; 5: 7; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-5-7).

"Kinder Surprise (Italian: Kinder Sorpresa or Ovetto Kinder), also known as Kinder Egg or Kinder Surprise Egg, is a milk chocolate consisting of a chocolate egg surrounding a yellow plastic capsule with a small toy inside. Manufactured by the Italian company Ferrero since 1974, [...] Kinder Surprise was originally created with children in mind, replicating an Italian Easter family tradition in which adults give children large chocolate eggs with toys inside. However, Kinder Surprise toys have become collectible for adults as well. Since 1974, 30 billion Kinder Surprise eggs have been sold worldwide" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinder_Surprise).

The following is a relatively recent review of the organism concerned:
Sun H, Wan Y, Du P, Bai L. The epidemiology of monophasic _Salmonella_ Typhimurium. Foodborne Pathog Dis. 2020; 17(2): 87-97; https://doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2019.2676
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
"_Salmonella enterica_ remains an important foodborne pathogen in all regions of the world, with Typhimurium as one of the most frequent serotypes causing foodborne disease. However, the past 2 decades have seen a rapid worldwide emergence of a new _Salmonella_ serotype, namely monophasic variant of _S._ Typhimurium, whose antigenic formula is 1,4,[5],12:i:-. It has become one of the 2-5 most common _Salmonella_ serotypes responsible for animal and human infections in different regions. The global epidemic of monophasic _S._ 1,4,[5],12:i:- has mainly been characterized by an increase in multidrug-resistant _S._ 1,4,[5],12:i:- isolated in Europe since 1997. The unexpected link to swine has escalated monophasic _S._ Typhimurium infections to the status of a global public health emergency. The large-scale application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in the last 10 years has revealed the phylogenetic associations of the bacterium and its antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. Local and global transmission reconstructed by WGS have shown that different clones have emerged following multiple independent events worldwide, and have elucidated the role of this zoonotic pathogen in the spread of AMR. This article discusses our current knowledge of the global ecology, epidemiology, transmission, bacterial adaptation, and evolution of this emerging salmonella serotype." - Mod.LL]
