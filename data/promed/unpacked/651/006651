Abstract: Through a weekly all-cause mortality surveillance system, we observed in France a major all-cause excess mortality from March to May 2020, concomitant with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic. The excess mortality was 25 030 deaths, mainly among elderly people. Five metropolitan regions were the most affected, particularly Ile-de-France and the Grand-Est regions. Assessing the excess mortality related to COVID-19 is complex because of the potential protective effect of the lockdown period on other causes of mortality.

Full-text: Since 9 Mar 2020 (week 11), a significant excess mortality has been observed at the national level in France, with a sharp increase in mortality from mid-March [2020], reaching the highest level in week 14 and then decreasing. This dramatic increase in mortality was concomitant with the COVID-19 epidemic.

A reactive all-cause mortality surveillance
-------------------------------------------
Since 2005, the French public health agency (Sante Publique France) has been following up all-cause mortality routinely, based on the administrative data transmitted by the French National Institute for Statistic and Economic Studies (INSEE). The medical causes of death are not recorded.

This sample from 3000 cities represents 77% of the total French mortality, varying from 42% to 98% in the 100 districts (1). We obtained the excess all-cause mortality from the difference between the estimated number of deaths and the expected number of deaths (baseline). The weekly expected number of deaths was provided by a statistical model developed by the European monitoring of excess mortality for public health action network (EuroMOMO, <www.euromomo.eu>) (2).

The excess deaths are expressed in proportion to the baseline (excess mortality x 100, divided by the baseline). The analysis is stratified by age-groups (under 15, 15-44, 45-64, 65-84, and 85 years or older) and sex at national and regional levels.

Estimates of excess all-cause mortality
---------------------------------------
From week 1 to week 10 in 2020, the estimated number of deaths varied around the expected value within 2 z-scores. The study period covered 2 Mar 2020 to 31 May 2020 (calendar weeks 10-22). Mortality increased sharply in week 11 in 2020 (crossing 2 z-scores) until week 14 in 2020. In week 14, the estimated number of deaths was 7100 deaths (+60%) above the expected number of deaths (n = 11 800 deaths) (Figure 1: Overall and cumulative excess all-cause and all-age mortality, France, calendar week 40, 2013 to week 22, 2020). The mortality then decreased until week 18. The estimated number of deaths returned to the expected range from week 18 to week 22 (Figure 1). Overall for the study period, the estimated number of deaths was 16.6% above the baseline for the whole of France (n = 25 030 excess deaths) (Table: Estimated number of all-cause deaths, excess mortality, proportion among the expected number of deaths and z-score, by age group and by region, France, 2 Mar-31 May 2020 (n = 175 801).

The cumulative excess mortality from week 40 in 2019 to week 22 in 2020 (30 Sep 2019-31 May 2020) exceeded cumulative excess mortality of the 5 full previous periods (from week 40 to 39 of the next year) (Figure 1).

Elderly people (65 years or older) were the most affected (Figure 2). From week 10 to week 22 in 2020, 23 400 excess deaths were estimated in this age group (+18.2%), while people aged 15-64 years experienced a moderate excess of deaths (+1510 deaths, +7% compared with baseline) (Table). In this age-group, the most affected were also the oldest (45-64 years) and more specifically men (+12% vs +5% in women compared with the baseline) (Figure 2: Overall and cumulative excess all-cause mortality by age-group, France, calendar week 40 in 2013 to week 22 in 2020 and Figure 3: Proportion of excess all-cause mortality among the expected number of deaths, by age-group and sex, France, 2 Mar-31 May 2020 [n = 175 801]). The estimated number of deaths in people aged 15-44 years was comparable with the expected number, for both men and women. In elderly people, the proportion of all-cause excess deaths for men (19.1%) was greater than for women (16.7%). The estimated number of deaths in children (under 15 years old) was lower than the expected value (-14%, n = -170 deaths), particularly for boys (-20%).

In comparison with the 5 full previous seasons, the cumulative all-cause excess mortality was close to 3 other seasons (2014/15, 2016/17 and 2017/18) for adults older than 85 years and to season 2017/18 for adults aged 45-64 years, but it was much greater for 65-84 year olds (Figure 2).

Major geographical disparities of excess mortality
--------------------------------------------------
Five metropolitan regions were particularly affected, with very high to exceptional excess mortality (z-scores value: 11-46.7) (Table). Ile-de-France (Paris area) was the most impacted region with +12 050 deaths in excess (+63.7% compared with the baseline), followed by the region Grand-Est (+4810 deaths, +36.9%) (Table). Excess mortality in the regions Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes, Bourgogne-Franche-Comte and Hauts-de-France ranged from +15% to +20%. Excess mortality among adults aged 15-64 years was predominantly observed in Ile-de-France.

Discussion: In the absence of medical information in civil status data, it cannot be estimated which part of the all-cause excess mortality is attributable to COVID-19. During this unusual pandemic, 2 complementary surveillance systems were implemented to report COVID-19 deaths in hospitals and long-term care facilities in France (3), but no system was able to report the COVID-19 mortality at home. A total of 29 200 COVID-19 deaths were reported by these 2 systems during the study period (4). This number of COVID-19-related deaths may be overestimated, as virological testing (PCR) was not systematically performed for all deaths reported by long-term care facilities.

The difference between our estimate of the all-cause excess mortality and the reported number of COVID-19 deaths in hospitals and long-term care facilities reflects the complexity to precisely estimate the epidemic impact since COVID-19 induced:

- an increase in deaths directly associated to severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
- an increase in deaths due to other severe health conditions left untreated because of the impact of the epidemic on the health system and the lockdown,
- a decrease in mortality due to the suspension of business, personal and tourism trips and activities during the lockdown period,
- a decrease in mortality following an earlier death of the most frail persons who could have died from COVID-19 several days or weeks before they would have died without the epidemic.

The baseline corresponds to a mortality situation in absence of events that influence mortality. In the epidemic context, the lockdown period may have a protective effect on mortality and the number of deaths during the epidemic may be lower than the calculated baseline. The protective effect may concern external causes of deaths (such as traffic or occupational accidents), deaths related to air pollution or to other communicable diseases. This hypothesis is consistent with the situation observed in 2 regions with a lower mortality than expected that started 3 weeks after the beginning of the lockdown and remained until the end of the lockdown period and even longer in one of the 2 regions. Such results were also reported in Portugal, for persons younger than 55 years (5). Further analysis using medical causes of deaths will allow disentangling the impact of lockdown on severe illnesses.

Different effects causing increases and decreases in mortality occur simultaneously during the same period. Providing an estimate for each effect is a great challenge. All-cause mortality data are insufficient to separate COVID-19-related deaths (directly or indirectly associated with the epidemic) from deaths related to other causes but do provide rapid and valid information on excess mortality impact.

Our results by age-group were consistent with previous studies that have reported a major impact on the elderly (5-8), but they differ for children. For children, our study showed a significantly smaller number of deaths than the baseline, whereas at the European level and in England, the number of deaths during the epidemic remained comparable with the baseline (6,7). The estimate of excess mortality by sex is rarely explored. In Italy, the excess among men was also higher than among women (8).

Overall, excess all-cause mortality is an essential indicator of disease impact, particularly during unusual events such as the current pandemic. All-cause mortality monitoring contributes to guide public health decisions and actions in order to reduce its impact at national and local level. The French surveillance system also contributes to the excess mortality surveillance at the European level through the EuroMOMO network that is particularly of interest in case of international threats (7).

[In an accompanying editorial (Vestergaard LS, Melbak K. Timely monitoring of total mortality associated with COVID-19: informing public health and the public. Euro Surveill. 2020; 25(34): pii=2001591. https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.34.2001591), the authors point out the need for continued monitoring of all-cause mortality with an eye on excess mortality as an indicator of the true mortality impact of the pandemic. It appears as though the NPI (non-pharmaceutical interventions -- masks, social distancing, handwashing) have had a significant impact on lowering the transmission of the virus as well as lowering the excess mortality burden, but the authors caution that a systemic review of impact of NPIs on mortality will await further time and data analyses.

The authors highlight the excess mortality in not just the elderly but also in younger age-groups, and conclude: "Indeed, numerous questions remain to be answered to fully understand the epidemiology and impact of COVID-19. So far, systematic weekly and retrospective all-cause mortality monitoring has told us that the total mortality of COVID-19 is considerably higher than judged from the official COVID-19 mortality statistics, and that younger adults and middle-aged individuals are not spared." - Mod.MPP]

Abstract: The degree of protective immunity conferred by infection with SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown. As such, the possibility of reinfection with this virus is not well understood. Herein, we describe the data from an investigation of 2 instances of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same individual. Through nucleic acid sequence analysis, the viruses associated with each instance of infection were found to possess a degree of genetic discordance that cannot be explained reasonably through short-term in vivo evolution. We conclude that it is possible for humans to become infected multiple times by SARS-CoV-2, but the generalizability of this finding is not known.

Abridged from full text: Evidence from the study of immunity to other coronaviruses has demonstrated that a loss of immunity to such viruses can occur within 1 to 3 years (2-9; see source URL for references and figures/tables). Cases of primary illness due to infection followed by a discrete secondary infection/illness with the same biological agent can best be ascertained as distinct infection events through genetic analysis of the agents associated with each illness event. Herein we describe a case of an individual who has had 2 distinct COVID illnesses from 2 genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This strongly supports that reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 can occur.

Materials and Methods: [Available at source URL.]

Results: In April 2020, a 25-year-old resident of Reno, NV tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 through a community-based testing event held by the Washoe County Health District (collection date: 18 Apr 2020). The patient indicated symptoms consistent with viral infection (sore throat, cough, headache, nausea, diarrhea; onset: 25 Mar 2020). During isolation, the patient indicated resolution of symptoms (27 Apr 2020). The patient was subsequently tested by 2 nucleic acid amplification tests and was found negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for specimens collected on 9 May 2020 (by transcription-mediated amplification [TMA]) and again on 26 May 2020 (by real-time PCR [RT-PCR]). The patient continued to feel well until 28 May 2020. On 31 May 2020, the patient sought care with self-reported fevers, headache, dizziness, cough, nausea, and diarrhea. A chest x-ray was performed, and he was discharged home. Five days later, on 5 Jun 2020, the patient presented to a family care doctor and was found to be hypoxic and was instructed to go to the emergency department after provision of oxygen. The patient was hospitalized that day and was assessed for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR testing. The patient required ongoing oxygen support and reported symptoms that included myalgia, cough and shortness of breath. A chest x-ray was performed on 5 Jun 2020 and compared with that of 31 May 2020 with the development of new patchy bilateral interstitial opacities suggestive of a viral or atypical pneumonia. RT-PCR results were positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. On 6 Jun 2020, the patient was tested for IgG/IgM for SARS-CoV-2 and was positive. A summary of specimens tested with result details is shown in Table 1.

With consideration of 2 episodes of symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and 2 specimens found reactive for SARS-CoV-2 specimens separated by symptomatic recovery, a period of 48 days, and 2 non-reactive (negative) SARS-CoV-2 test results, we performed nucleic acid sequencing of the viruses associated with the positive cases.

Sequence data indicated that the specimen collected in April 2020 (specimen A) was found to be a member of clade 20C by way of genomic sequence analysis identifying all 5 mutation positions and bases that describe the clade. The 2nd reactive (positive) specimen, collected in June 2020 (specimen B) was also found to be a member of clade 20C, presenting the clade-defining mutations C3037T, C14408T, A23403G, C1059T and G25563T. In addition to possessing hallmark mutations of the 20C clade, case A was determined to possess 5 further single nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared with 17 in the reference genome. Sequence data from case B show 6 additional SNVs and a mutation at position 14407, being adjacent to C14408T, recorded as a dinucleotide multi-nucleotide variant (MNV) at positions 14407-14408 of the genome (Figure 1 and Table 2). Six SNVs were shared between case A and case B (Table 2A) -- the 5 which define the 20C clade, and C241T. Case A had 4 SNVs that are absent from the latter case (Table 2B), while case B had 7 SNVs (Table 2C) absent in the former. A visualization of the relationship of the sequence data sets between cases A and B is shown in Figure 1. There were an additional 3 deletions and one insertion in case B sequence relative to the reference sequence (Supplemental Table 1), as called using CLC Genomics Workbench.

The individual associated with these cases possesses no significant conditions of an immunological nature that would imply facilitation of re-infection. They were not utilizing any immunosuppressive medications. The individual was negative for HIV by antibody and RNA testing (data not shown) and had no obvious cell count abnormalities. The secondary positive case (B) occurred simultaneously to a positive case of a co-habitant (parent), also positive by NAAT (TMA) on 5 Jun 2020. Sequencing is being attempted on this case to ascertain its potential role in case B. However, the infected co-habitant's positive specimen was collected and tested in the Hologic Aptima format, which did not align with the procedures established at our sequencing laboratory at the time of submission. The positive case provides a possible source for secondary exposure and (re)infection.

Discussion: The data herein support an instance of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. For case A to experience mutations to become case B, the virus would have had to exhibit a rate of 83.64 substitutions per year, a rate that markedly exceeds that of 23.12, currently observed (30). However, of enormous significance, 4 of the discordant loci seen between case A and case B would be reversions specific to the ancestral genotype. The odds of this occurring are vanishingly remote and virtually ensure that these are 2 distinct viral infection events. Of course, if such a remarkable event of base change did occur in that timeframe, then the remarkable nature of cases A and B would shift from a case of possible reinfection to a case of high-rate evolution within an infected individual.

[This is now the 4th reported incidence of possible reinfection of an individual with a different virus from that of the initial infection. The facts that both viruses sequenced belonged to clade 20C, and that the 2nd clinical presentation occurred about 2 months after the 1st, I can't help but wonder if this case was one of recurrence of symptoms after not fully clearing the original infection. There have been anecdotal reports of prolonged recurrent clinical presentations, which in this case may have been accompanied by mutations of the virus during the prolonged infection. I suspect there will be a plethora of such case reports appearing over the coming days and weeks, each one raising questions that need addressing.

Ryan McGinnis also sent a link to a media report with a table containing 7 reported episodes of 2nd infections (https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/08/covid-19-reinfection-tracker/) -- interesting, and in keeping with expected reports now that the topic has been opened in discussion. The cases with short intervals between infections are highly suspect of being continued infections with the original virus; media reports of the cases said there were "slight differences" in the viruses between episodes. - Mod.MPP]

[3] South Korea: Prolonged pediatric viral shedding
Date: Fri 28 Aug 2020

New research suggests that children can shed SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, even if they never develop symptoms or for long after symptoms have cleared. But many questions remain about the significance of the pediatric population as vectors for this sometimes deadly disease, according to an invited commentary by Children's National Hospital doctors that accompanies this new study published online 18 Aug 2020 in JAMA Pediatrics. The commissioned editorial, written by Roberta L DeBiasi, chief of the Division of Pediatric Diseases, and Meghan Delaney, chief of the Division of Pathology and Lab Medicine, provides important insight on the role children might play in the spread of COVID-19 as communities continue to develop public health strategies to rein in this disease.

The study that sparked this commentary focused on 91 pediatric patients followed at 22 hospitals throughout South Korea. "Unlike in the American health system, those who test positive for COVID-19 in South Korea stay at the hospital until they clear their infections even if they aren't symptomatic," explains Dr DeBiasi. The patients here were identified for testing through contact tracing or developing symptoms. About 22% never developed symptoms, 20% were initially asymptomatic but developed symptoms later, and 58% were symptomatic at their initial test. Over the course of the study, the hospitals where these children stayed continued to test them every 3 days on average, providing a picture of how long viral shedding continues over time.

The study's findings show that the duration of symptoms varied widely, from 3 days to nearly 3 weeks. There was also a significant spread in how long children continued to shed virus and could be potentially infectious. While the virus was detectable for an average of about 2.5 weeks in the entire group, a significant portion of the children -- about one-fifth of the asymptomatic patients and about one-half of the symptomatic ones -- were still shedding virus at the 3-week mark.

DeBiasi and Delaney write in their commentary that the study makes several important points that add to the knowledge base about COVID-19 in children. One of these is the large number of asymptomatic patients -- about one-fifth of the group followed in this study. Another is that children, a group widely thought to develop mostly mild disease that quickly passes, can retain symptoms for weeks. A third and important point, they say, is the duration of viral shedding. Even asymptomatic children continued to shed virus for a long time after initial testing, making them potential key vectors.

However, the commentary authors say, despite these important findings, the study raises several questions. One concerns the link between testing and transmission. A qualitative "positive" or "negative" on testing platforms may not necessarily reflect infectivity, with some positives reflecting bits of genetic material that may not be able to make someone sick or negatives reflecting low levels of virus that may still be infectious.

Testing reliability may be further limited by the testers themselves, with sampling along different portions of the respiratory tract or even by different staff members leading to different laboratory results. It's also unknown whether asymptomatic individuals are shedding different quantities of virus than those with symptoms, a drawback of the qualitative testing performed by most labs. Further, testing only for active virus instead of antibodies ignores the vast number of individuals who may have had and cleared an asymptomatic or mild infection, an important factor for understanding herd immunity.

Lastly, DeBiasi and Delaney point out the study tested only for viral shedding from the respiratory tract even though multiple studies have detected the virus in other bodily fluids, including stool. It's unknown what role these other sources might play in the spread of this disease.

DeBiasi and Delaney note that each of these findings and additional questions could affect public health efforts continually being developed and refined to bring COVID-19 under control in the USA and around the world. Children's National has added their own research to these efforts, with ongoing studies to assess how SARS-CoV-2 infections proceed in children, including how antibodies develop both at the individual and population level.

"Each of these pieces of information that we, our collaborators and other scientists around the world are working to gather," says DeBiasi, "is critical for developing policies that will slow the rate of viral transmission in our community."

Abstract
--------
Importance: There is limited information describing the full spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection in children.

Objective: To analyze the full clinical course and the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectability in children confirmed with COVID-19 in the Republic of Korea, where rigorous public health interventions have been implemented.

Design, setting, and participants: This case series of children with COVID-19 was conducted in 20 hospitals and 2 nonhospital isolation facilities across the country from 18 Feb 2020 to 31 Mar 2020. Children younger than 19 years who had COVID-19 were included.

Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19, detected via SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab or sputum by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

Main outcomes and measures: Clinical manifestations during the observation period, including the time and duration of symptom occurrence. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was also analyzed.

Results: A total of 91 children with COVID-19 were included (median [range] age, 11 [0-18] years; 53 boys [58%]). Twenty children (22%) were asymptomatic during the entire observation period. Among 71 symptomatic cases, 47 children (66%) had unrecognized symptoms before diagnosis, 18 (25%) developed symptoms after diagnosis, and only 6 (9%) were diagnosed at the time of symptom onset. Twenty-two children (24%) had lower respiratory tract infections. The mean (standard deviation; SD) duration of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory samples was 17.6 (6.7) days. Virus RNA was detected for a mean (SD) of 14.1 (7.7) days in asymptomatic individuals. There was no difference in the duration of virus RNA detection between children with upper respiratory tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections (mean [SD], 18.7 [5.8] days vs 19.9 [5.6] days; P = 0.54). Fourteen children (15%) were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir and/or hydroxychloroquine. All recovered, without any fatal cases.

Conclusions and relevance: In this case series study, inapparent infections in children may have been associated with silent COVID-19 transmission in the community. Heightened surveillance using laboratory screening will allow detection in children with unrecognized SARS-CoV-2 infection.

[These countries were selected on account of having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but having responded differently. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. Lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is continuing and reported deaths have been increasing as well. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented, and as of 21 Aug 2020, they are being implemented again. In Italy and Spain, there are major increases in reported cases. The 24-hour positivity rate in the USA is consistent with continued ongoing significant transmission in the community. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, wearing face masks, handwashing, and the avoidance of large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mods.MPP/UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory for 28 Aug 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesAug28_1598647031.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 48.1% of daily case numbers and 64.0% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 12.8 million cases. The USA and Brazil still dominate with Colombia, Argentina, Peru, and Mexico very active as well, as are Bolivia and Guatemala.

- The European region reported 14.6% of daily case numbers and 6.7% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and total cumulative cases reported exceed 4.1 million. Spain dominates followed by France, Russia, Israel, Ukraine, Turkey, Germany, Turkey, Romania, Italy, and the UK. Five western European countries have returned to prominence. Luxembourg removed over 1300 cases from the cumulative case count in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.5% of daily case numbers and 5.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 1.8 million cases. Iraq still dominates followed by Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Lebanon, Palestinian Authority, and Libya.

- The African region reported 1.3% of daily case numbers and 0.93% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and have reported more than 1 million cases. South Africa did not report any newly confirmed cases to WHO in the past 24 hours. With the absence of South Africa's dominating reports, Ethiopia had the highest number of cases in the last 24 hours followed Algeria, Kenya, Nigeria, and Namibia.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.7% of daily case numbers and 2.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.47 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan, South Korea and Australia.

- The South East Asia region reported 29.7% of the daily newly reported cases and 21.1% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.9 million cases. India continues to dominate with reports of over 77 000 cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Nepal.

Impression: The overall picture by region is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries with resurgences associated with lifting of restrictions; most noteworthy are the western European countries.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 28 Aug 2020, is the same epidemic curve included in the previous situation updates and is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the text above. - Mod.MPP]

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (76 665), followed by the USA (49 601), and Brazil (48 112) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (53.7%). There were 5978 deaths reported in the past 24 hours (27-28 Aug 2020).

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by USA, Brazil, Peru, Argentina, Colombia, France, Mexico, Russia, and Iraq. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 4177 to 76 665. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Philippines, Spain, Indonesia, Ukraine, Bolivia, Bangladesh, Iran, Venezuela, Chile and South Africa, and their range of reported new cases is 1846 to 3963. A total of 32 countries have reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is a small change in the average number of daily reported cases (an increase of 2.0%), while daily reported deaths have decreased 3.9%. The key question remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether these figures reflect either reporting artifact seen surrounding weekends or a decrease in reporting.

Impression: Basically unchanged from previous discussions -- the SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; however, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing or case reporting. For example, the USA reported data suggest a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases, but the 24-hour positivity rate is 11.0%, consistent with ongoing community transmission (see section [4E] above). The European region is seeing increasing cases in western European countries that had markedly reduced transmission in late spring. The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily case counts, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). India also drives the next most affected region -- South East Asia -- with persistent high daily case reports. - Mod.MPP]
