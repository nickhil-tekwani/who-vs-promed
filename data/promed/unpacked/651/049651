Thank you for your continuous health surveillance.

In this message I am surprised by the mention of "guinea pig" which is a South-American rodent often hold as pet in some countries.

Is this also the case in this part of Congo DR? If the rodents involved are domesticated or pets kept home this may add to the epidemiological context.

Yes, an inheritance from the Belgians in Eastern DRC between 1930 and 1960. At the time they had a facility called the Plague Laboratory in Blukwa (head was Dr Fain famous parasitologist working with Dr Misonne who worked on rodents) where they developed a plague vaccine and they tested plague strain virulence on imported guinea pigs. They seem to have been acclimatized -- do not forget the highlands of Ituri are at 2000 m [about 6562 ft] and the weather is very different from the lowland. The guinea pigs were adopted by the villagers who keep and breed them in their houses with rabbits. I saw the same in Mbulu and Lushoto plague foci of Tanzania, again in the highlands. And yes, it is true that in the plague focus of Ecuador (I think in 2004) near Riobamba, human outbreaks were preceded by die off of guinea pigs.

[Guinea pigs and cavies are Neotropical rodents included in the Genera _Cavia_, _Galea_, and _Microcavia_. At least 5 species of _Cavia_ are recognised, inhabiting a broad area of South America. Most of them are found in plains and forests, not in dry environments at high altitude. The guinea pig, _C. porcellus_ is one of the few species domesticated by pre-Columbian civilizations (the other 2 are llamas and alpacas). It does not exist in the wild, and the origin is still unclear, although studies suggest they are closely related to _C. tschudi_ (the montane Guinea pig), a species native to the Andes that lives in moist habitats with rocks and coarse vegetation.

In South America, _Yersinia pestis_ persists infecting _Rattus_ spp and several native rodent species, including wild guinea pigs. Raising guinea pigs at households is considered a risk factor for outbreaks, as they become infected and are host of fleas that may bite humans. - Mod.PMB
