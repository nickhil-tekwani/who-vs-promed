[In a recently released report (MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2014; 63(25); 552-3 http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6325a5.htm?s_cid=mm6325a5_w), during 19 Sep 2013-15 Dec 2013, a total of 175 cases of cholera were confirmed in La Huasteca (159 in Hidalgo, 14 in Veracruz, and 2 in San Luis Potosi). These cases and those of 2013 occurred in La Huasteca area (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Huasteca), a geographical and cultural region located in Mexico along the Gulf of Mexico that includes parts of the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Puebla, Hidalgo, San Luis Potosi, Queretaro, and Guanajuato. It is roughly defined as the area in which the Huastec people had influence when their civilization was at its height in the Mesoamerican period. Today, the Huastecs occupy only a fraction of this region, with the Nahua people now the most numerous indigenous group. - Mod.LL]

In the 6 Kabkabiya camps in North Darfur, 14 infants aged between one month to 2 years and a half, died within the past 2 weeks of diarrhea and vomiting, a displaced person informed Radio Dabanga.

"There are at least 100 other similar cases in the camps. The children are weak anyhow because of chronic malnutrition," she said.

[3] Cholera - Ghana, vaccine request
Date: Tue 2 Sep 2014

Government, in a desperate attempt to end the growing number of cholera cases, has initiated discussions with the World Health Organization (WHO) to supply vaccines to help bring the situation under control. Over 10 000 cholera cases have been recorded in 7 regions with over 80 deaths. According to the WHO, Ghana's highest number of recorded cholera cases was 14 160 in 1983. Therefore, the 2014 outbreak with the recorded 10 000 cases could be the 2nd highest.

Speaking to Citi News, Deputy Health Minister Victor Bampoe said the vaccine from the WHO is one of the short-term measures being implemented by government to address the situation. He disclosed that there are 2 potent oral vaccines, and the government is working with the WHO to "see whether Ghana qualifies to use the vaccines in the current epidemic." The minister said they will make a final decision about whether to vaccinate people in the 3 regions of the north or affected areas in the southern part of the country. This is expected to prevent the possible spread of the disease from the south to the northern part of the country.

The vaccines, according to the Deputy Health Minister could also be administered "strategically" to residents in the affected regions to break the transmission of the disease. Dr. Bampoe told Citi News that the WHO has specific guidelines on which category of individuals could be given the oral vaccines. "For one of them, you will give it to children over the age of one, and with the other, you will give it to children over the age of 2," he said.

He pointed out that when the WHO releases the drug, government will decide on how to use it "if indeed we qualify to use [it]." The WHO will send over some officials to undertake some scientific assessments on the cholera situation in Ghana before the vaccines may be released.

http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/635917/over-100-ill-with-suspected-cholera-in-zamboanga-city


A 7-month-old baby died of dehydration, while more than 100 residents of Barangay (village) Limpapa, some 42 km from this city proper, have fallen ill with suspected cholera. Limpapa village chief Antonio Lacaser told the Philippine Daily Inquirer that the number of those who fell sick since Saturday night, 6 Sep 2014, has been rising. "We have more than 50 cases brought to the nearby district hospital, while more than 30 others were rushed to hospitals downtown. There are more than 40 individuals who opted to be attended by our midwife," Lacaser said.

Three of the patients who were brought to a private hospital showed signs that they were "suffering from cholera," Lacaser said.

Dr. Rodelin Agbulos, city health officer, told the Philippine Daily Inquirer by phone that it was too early to say that there was a cholera outbreak. "Right now, we suspect cholera, and we are conducting rectal swabs, and results will be available by tomorrow (Mon 8 Sep 2014)," Agbulos said. He said the patients complained of loose bowel movements.
