If you attended Imagine Cinemas at Thornhill's [Ontario] Promenade Mall on [Sat 9 Jun 2018] to see the new Star Wars movie, you may have been exposed to the measles.

That's the message from investigators from York Region's public health, who say there was a confirmed care of the measles on that date.

As a result, moviegoers might have been exposed to the measles while watching Solo: A Star Wars Story between 7 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. Those who attended the theatre need to be vigilant about the possibilities of these symptoms appearing over 21 days, by [30 Jun 2018].

It's not only those inside the theatre that need to be aware, according to the agency. Exposure could have taken place at concession stands, washrooms, and the theatre lobby.

Anyone who attended the theatre at that time should check immunization records or speak with a healthcare provider to confirm they have been given 2 doses of measles vaccine, named MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] or MMRV, or they have documented measles immunity, which may include a previous laboratory confirmed measles infection.

Venezuela, devastated by economic and political crises, accounted for 85 percent of cases of measles reported across Latin America and the Caribbean over the past year, the Pan-American Health Organization reports.

Of the 11 countries that reported cases, Venezuela had the overwhelming majority of cases, but also 35 deaths since mid-2017, the international organization said.

More specifically, "there were 11 countries that reported 1685 confirmed measles cases across the region," of which 1427 were in Venezuela, a PAHO report released [Sat 9 Jun 2018] found.

The disease is on the rise in the South American nation led by leftist President Nicolas Maduro; the trend has continued this year [2018] where cases have been reported in 17 out of 23 states, and in the capital.

In neighboring countries, where Venezuelans have migrated due to grim economic conditions, many of the reported cases have been among Venezuelan immigrants, the report said.

Venezuela says it does not have 85 percent of the basic medical supplies it needs even including vaccines. Maduro's government blames US sanctions for the woes.

The government on [6 Apr 2018] launched a new vaccine campaign against 14 diseases, including measles and TB.

Parents are being urged to be vigilant after a case of measles at a school near Bristol [Somerset county]. Letters were sent home with pupils at Gordano School in Portishead on [Fri 15 Jun 2018] after an 11-year-old pupil at the school was diagnosed with measles last week [week of 11 Jun 2018].

Public Health England has been informed of the year 7 student's case. It is not thought there have been any other confirmed cases at the school.

School leaders are urging parents whose children have not been vaccinated against measles and show symptoms of the disease to keep their child away from classes.

In a letter to parents, head teacher Tom Inman said: "Public Health England has been informed that one of our students was diagnosed with measles this week.

"In accordance with Public Health England guidelines, we recommend that if your child has not been vaccinated, and is showing signs of a cold/temperature, they should stay off school until after the incubation period of 4 days from the 1st symptoms, at which point the traditional rash would have appeared."

There have been a number of cases of measles reported across the Bristol area in recent weeks.

Earlier this month [June 2018] parents at St Barnabas CofE [Church of England] School in Bristol received letters warning their children may have been exposed to the disease after a suspected case in an individual with links to the school.

Public Health England consultant in public health and screening and immunisation lead Consultant Dr Ardiana Gjini said: "We are currently seeing an outbreak of measles across Avon, Gloucestershire, and Wiltshire, with cases in North Somerset.

"Outbreaks are also being seen in other parts of the UK and across Europe."

Public Health leaders are now urging parents to ensure their children are vaccinated against the disease. The spokesman added: "We are writing to parents/carers recommending that all children who are un-vaccinated receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccine to protect them."

Russia's federal service for the oversight of consumer rights protection, Rospotrebnadzor, has called on the Russians to get vaccination for measles before trips abroad, as the disease is spearing in a number of regions of the world.

"Rospotrebnadzor calls public attention to the reports [on the spread of measles] and notes separately that vaccination offers the only reliable preventive protection against measles," the agency said in a warning at its website. "Therefore we make a recommendation to the people who have not been vaccinated and have not been down with measles previously to get vaccination at least 14 days before the scheduled trip," the report said.

Rospotrebnadzor quoted information from the World Health Organization, which pointed out a notable increase in the incidence of measles in 28 South American countries -- Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela, and also in the US and Canada.

"The Center for Public Health at the Healthcare Ministry of Ukraine points out the level of incidence of measles in Ukraine in 2017 exceeded the figures for 2016 by a factor of 70," the report said. "In all, as many as 20 553 cases of measles have been registered there since the beginning of this year, including 8331 cases among adults and 12 222 cases among children."

"Eleven people have died from complications caused by the disease," the agency said.

As the root-cause of the situation, it pointed out the low levels of vaccination among the rank-and-file people.

The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) has recommended that all those travelling to the 2018 FIFA World Cup ensure that they're up-to-date with all their vaccinations, including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (also known as MMR). The 2018 World Cup will be hosted this year by Russia between 14 Jun and 15 Jul.

The increase in international travel and the mass movement of people during events such as the World Cup increases the risk of transmission of diseases. It also increases the likelihood of travelers returning to their countries with diseases such as measles, which is highly contagious and can have grave consequences on the health of unvaccinated populations.

On 12-19 Jun 2018, 1401 measles cases have been recorded in Ukraine, of which 560 were adults and 841 children, as reported by the Public Health Center at the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, referring to the operational data.

It is also noted that since [the start of 2018], 21 894 people have been infected across the country, including 8857 adults and 13 037 children. According to the report, the greatest number of measles contractions was reported in Lviv (3428 people: 1042 adults and 2386 children); Zakarpattia (2633 people: 475 adults and 2158 children); Ivano-Frankivsk (2422 people: 698 adults and 1724 children); Odessa (1880 people: 924 adults and 956 children); Kyiv [Kiev] (1560 people: 965 adults and 595 children); and Chernivtsi (1202 people: 398 adults and 804 children) regions.

During the said period, 11 people died from measles complications: 7 children and 4 adults. The Ministry reminded they would soon start vaccination of adults from higher-risk groups. "Currently, the procedure for the immunization of adults is being approved, and groups that will be vaccinated free of charge are being determined, of which the Ministry of Health will inform separately," the press service noted. The Ministry of Health says that the measles vaccine is available in all regions of Ukraine.

Weekly bulletin on outbreaks and other emergencies week 24: [11-17 Jun 2018; data as of 15 Jun 2018]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Liberia: 2930 cases, 14 deaths, 0.5 percent CFR

Event description
-----------------
Liberia has been experiencing recurrent measles outbreaks since the beginning of 2018. In week 23 (week ending 10 Jun 2018), a total of 61 new suspected measles cases (with no deaths) were reported from 13 out of the 15 counties in the country, compared to 72 new cases reported in week 22 [week ending 3 Jun 2018]. 23 blood specimens collected from the suspected cases have been shipped to the National Reference Laboratory, while 20 of the case-patients had epidemiological links to confirmed cases. During the reporting week, 14 out of 92 health districts (in 5 counties) attained measles epidemic threshold of 3 laboratory confirmed cases. The 5 counties are Grand Bassa, Margibi, Maryland, Montserrado, and Nimba.

Between week 1 and week 23 of 2018 [1 Jan-10 Jun 2018], a total of 3086 suspected measles cases were reported. Of these, 177 were laboratory confirmed, 1762 had epidemiological links to confirmed cases, 562 were clinically compatible, 156 were discarded (after testing negative), and test results for 429 cases were pending. Of the 2930 confirmed, epidemiologically linked, clinically compatible, and suspected cases, 14 have died, giving a case fatality rate of 0.5 percent in this group; 558 (19 percent) were vaccinated, 334 (11 percent) were not vaccinated and 2 038 (70 percent) had unknown vaccination status. About 39 percent of the affected people are 4 years of age and below, 25 percent are between 5 and 9 years and 36 percent are 10 years and above.

Public health actions
---------------------
The Ministry of Health Expanded Program on Immunization and the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) are coordinating response activities to the measles outbreak, with support from WHO, UNICEF, and other partners. The national epidemic preparedness and response committee (NEPRC), under the leadership of NPHIL and with technical support from WHO, UNICEF, US-CDC and other agencies, have been meeting weekly to review the measles outbreak situation and provide technical support to sub-national level. WHO has deployed the Polio STOP team in the 15 counties to support sub-national level response.

A nation-wide measles immunization campaign has been conducted across the country in 3 phases since 15 Feb 2018, targeting a total of 654 803 children aged 6-59 months. Preliminary data indicates that 97 percent (63 350) of the targeted populations were vaccinated across the country.

Active search for measles cases continues throughout the country and has been reinforced in districts and communities with sustained outbreaks. Epidemic threshold is monitored weekly across the country through routine data collection and analysis.

All measles cases are being provided with symptomatic management along with a high dose of vitamin A.

The National Public Health Reference Laboratory has been testing samples reported across the country, by serology (IgM detection), and routinely releasing test results.

Communities have been provided with education to seek early care for measles cases at the nearest health facility. Communities have also mobilized through town criers, radio messaging, and posters to ensure high coverage of the immunization campaign among targeted age group.

Situation interpretation
------------------------
Liberia has been experiencing recurrent measles outbreaks since the beginning of the year [2018]. The reason for these outbreaks is known: the accumulation of a large number of susceptible populations over the years due to suboptimal immunization coverage. It is concerning that measles incidence cases are occurring in spite of the 3 phases of mass immunization campaigns conducted since February 2018, with seemingly high administrative coverage. The national authorities and partners need to drastically and speedily reduce the number of susceptible individuals in the most affected age-groups, maintain the build-up of vulnerable individuals at very low levels by immunising a large proportion (over 95 percent) of each new birth cohort and implement additional vaccination activities to periodically protect susceptible individuals who have accumulated.

With the well-developed immunization programme, structures, and systems, such measles outbreaks should be predicted and adequate preparedness measures put in place. Additionally, each measles outbreak should be followed by thorough evaluation of the cause of the outbreak, the surveillance system for early outbreak detection, the preparedness measures preceding the outbreak and the management of the outbreak, and an overall review of immunization programme goals and operations.

The Ministry of Health and Sanitation today [15 Jun 2018] declared a measles outbreak in Falaba [Koinadugu] district in the remote northern part of Sierra Leone. There have been a total of 19 [24 in other reports - Mod.LK] confirmed cases this week in the Chiefdoms of Sulima (14 cases) and Mongo (5 cases) [Koinadugu district], close to the border with Guinea.

A measles outbreak is defined as 3 or more laboratory confirmed cases in a community or district in 1 month.

"We are doing everything in our power to bring this outbreak under control, with teams already on the ground leading the response," said Dr. Brima Kargbo, Chief Medical Officer at the Ministry of Health and Sanitation. "Given the location of the affected communities, we are working with our counterparts in Guinea to ensure continued collaboration on measles vaccination efforts, community engagement and surveillance."

"While we are planning an emergency vaccination campaign within Koinadugu, we want to encourage all caregivers everywhere in the country to ensure children aged under 2 years have received their 2 doses of the measles marklate [vaccine], which provides lasting protection against the disease," said Dr Kargbo. "Vaccination is the only reliable way to ensure your child is protected against this life-threatening illness, which can be devastating in its effects."

With support from WHO, MSF, UNICEF, UK Aid, and other partners, the response to the recent cases will include a targeted vaccination campaign for children in affected and most at-risk areas in Koinadugu district, cross-border collaboration and community engagement, contact-tracing and enhanced surveillance for suspected measles cases. Parents and caregivers are also being reminded to ensure their children's routine vaccines are up to date.

"Across the country, vaccination uptake has recovered following the Ebola outbreak," said Dr Kargbo. "However there are still areas where vaccination coverage is sub-optimal, especially in communities that are very remote and where populations are mobile and travelling across borders. This will require concerted efforts not only from our health workers but also caregivers, communities, local authorities and health partners to ensure that every child, everywhere is reached with their necessary vaccines."

The Koinadugu vaccine campaign is expected to start within the next 2 weeks.

This is a press release from the Ministry of Health and Sanitation and WHO.

On 16 May 2018, Japan's National International Health Regulations Focal Point (NFP) notified WHO of an ongoing outbreak of measles in Japan. On 20 Mar 2018, a traveller from overseas was diagnosed with measles in Okinawa prefecture, and thereafter additional cases of measles were reported from across the prefecture and later from other prefectures. In light of the situation, on 11 and 26 Apr 2018, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) circulated 2 alert notices. The national trend in notifications and reports of new measles cases from Okinawa prefecture have both declined in recent weeks (onset date of the most recent case in Okinawa was 10 May 2018). Okinawa prefecture officially declared the outbreak over on 11 Jun 2018, after 4 weeks had passed since this last case. This report provides the latest information on the epidemiologic situation of measles in Japan, including outbreak cases in Okinawa prefecture and the other cases, and indicates the need for continued vigilance.

From 1 Jan through 20 May 2018, 161 cases of measles were diagnosed, including 145 (90 percent) laboratory-confirmed cases (99 cases of measles and 46 cases of modified measles). 89 cases are male and 72 cases are female, and the median age is 29 years-old (range: 0-58 years). Cases were reported from the following prefectures: Okinawa (88 cases); Aichi (25 cases); Fukuoka (17 cases); Tokyo (11 cases); Saitama (six cases); Ibaraki and Kanagawa (3 cases from each prefecture); Yamanashi and Osaka (2 cases from each prefecture); and Chiba, Shizuoka, Hyogo, and Yamaguchi (1 case from each prefecture). The suspected location of infection was Japan for 136 cases, overseas for 12 cases, and unknown for the remaining 13 cases. Among the total cases, to date, information for 30 cases regarding their isolated measles virus genotype have been received through the national surveillance system; excluding 1 case with vaccine strain, 25 were genotype D8 and 4 were genotype B3.

Cases of imported measles continue to occur in Japan. Japan has successfully eliminated endemic measles transmission and sustained this status since March 2015 through both high vaccination coverage and rapid detection of and response to every case of measles. In 2016, routine vaccination coverage was 97 percent for the 1st dose (1 year of age) and 93 percent for the 2nd dose (year before entrance to primary school, usually 5 years of age); serological surveys have confirmed that the proportion of antibody-positive (particle agglutination titer 16 or higher) individuals aged 2 years or more has remained at 95 percent or above nationally.

Public health response
----------------------
Specific actions implemented by the MHLW and local governments for the ongoing situation include:
- active epidemiological investigations, contact tracing, and monitoring of close contacts for all cases;
- risk communication and circulation of alerts to medical professionals, including the importance of considering measles as a possible diagnosis and implementation of appropriate infection control measures in medical settings;
- encouraging appropriate implementation of routine immunization for measles and catch-up immunization for those with low immunity against measles.

WHO risk assessment
---------------------
Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that remains one of the leading causes of mortality among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. Transmission from person-to-person is airborne, as well as by direct or indirect contact of secretions (nasal, throat) of an infected person. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10-12 days after infection, include high fever, runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreads downwards. A patient is infectious 4 days before the start of the rash for up to 4 days after the appearance of the rash. While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, vitamin A is recommended by WHO for all children infected with measles regardless of their country of residence, as it is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality.

In March 2015, Japan was verified as having achieved measles elimination (defined as interruption of endemic measles virus transmission for at least 36 months). Nevertheless, outbreaks caused by imported cases may occur sporadically. The risk of a large measles outbreak in Japan is low due to the control measures put in place and sensitive surveillance to detect cases promptly. However, the possibility of exported cases cannot be fully ruled out because of the high volume of international travellers.

WHO advice
----------
In light of continuous reports of imported measles cases, WHO urges all Member States to:
- Vaccinate to maintain homogeneous coverage of 95 percent with the 1st and 2nd doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine in all municipalities. Conduct risk assessments to identify populations at risk of being missed by vaccination activities and proactively take corrective actions to fill immunity gaps, including development of special communication and immunization strategies as needed.
- In settings with low incidence and high risk of importation of measles virus, vaccinate populations at high risk of exposure to imported measles (without proof of vaccination or immunity against measles and rubella), such as health workers, people working in tourism and transportation (hotel and catering, airports, taxi drivers, etc.).
- Ensure that policies and procedures are in place to reduce risk of hospital-associated transmission of measles, such as appropriate triage and airborne isolation of suspected measles cases; avoiding unnecessary hospitalization of mild measles cases; and ensuring that only measles-immune healthcare workers care for suspected measles cases.
- Promote medical consultation prior to travel in order to vaccinate all non-immune international travellers who missed their recommended measles doses. In addition, this consultation will include information about the most important health risks, determine the need for any other vaccinations and/or medication and identify any other medical items that the traveller may require.
- Strengthen epidemiological surveillance of measles for timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private health care facilities and ensure that: cases are investigated within 48 hours of detection; and that adequate and appropriate laboratory specimens are collected for both serological and molecular tests at the 1st contact with suspected cases. Ensure that operational resources and training are adequate so that case investigations and laboratory sample transportation for case confirmation can be performed at all subnational levels.
- Ensure that resources are in place at all levels so that measles outbreaks can be rapidly investigated and immunization response measures can be rapidly implemented. These contingency resources may include dedicated funds and rapid response teams; identification of flexible resources and public health personnel who may serve as surge capacity if large-scale investigation or immunization response is required; and a stock-pile reserve of measles-rubella (MR) vaccine and supplies. Ensure that national plans and standardized operating procedures for measles outbreak response are developed and updated.
