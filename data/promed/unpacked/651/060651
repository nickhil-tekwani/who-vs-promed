More poultry deaths and infected sites have been reported in Vietnam's Hau
Giang, Ca Mau and Bac Lieu provinces in the last 2 days.

Nguyen Hien Trung, head of Hau Giang's animal health department, said a new
site had been identified in Vi Thuy district yesterday [1 Jan 2007] after a
dead bird had tested positive for the deadly H5N1 virus strain.

A total of 3 communes in 2 districts had bird flu, he said.

Luong Ngoc Lan, head of Bac Lieu's department of agriculture and rural
development, said more poultry deaths had been reported in Hong Dan, Hoa
Binh, Vinh Loi, and Gia Rai districts on Sunday [31 Dec 2006].

The dead birds had tested H5N1 positive in Hong Dan and Hoa Binh while
results were awaited from the other 2 districts, Lan said.

In Ca Mau many poultry reportedly died Monday [1 Jan 2007].

The epidemic has hit at least 13 districts in the 3 provinces, prompting
the slaughter of tens of thousands of fowl. Four people in Bac Lieu and 2
in Soc Trang provinces have been hospitalized with bird flu symptoms.

Last week Vietnam launched a national anti-bird flu campaign to stamp out
the epidemic.

At least 42 people have died of the H5N1 virus in Vietnam since 2003 with
the latest case reported in November 2005.
