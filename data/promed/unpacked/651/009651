Thailand/Viet Nam: 2 More Avian Influenza Deaths
--------------------------------------------------
[The deaths of] an 18-year-old man in Vietnam and a 58-year-old Thai
woman took the total death toll in East Asia to 12. People who have
contracted avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection are thought to
have caught it through contact with sick birds. The World Health
Organization (WHO) has said it cannot rule out one case of
human-to-human transmission in Viet Nam, but there was no firm
evidence of it. The case involves 2 sisters who died after having
contact with their brother. The man died after appearing to contract
avian influenza, although he was cremated before tests were done. The
WHO said it had not been able to conclusively identify the source of
infection for the 2 sisters, and that their brother was therefore one
possible explanation.
However, the WHO has described the case as an anomaly and said there
was no evidence of the virus spreading throughout the general
population.
In other developments:
- WHO warns that the virus is far from being under control, urging
strong collaborative efforts;
- In Hong Kong, poultry workers have begun receiving free influenza
vaccinations as part of the government's efforts to prevent the virus
from spreading to the territory;
- International health and agriculture agencies are due to hold
crisis talks in Rome on Tuesday;
- China on Sun 1 Feb 2004 reported 5 more areas with suspected cases
of bird flu in poultry.
Details of the new deaths are as follows: A teenager from Viet Nam's
Central Highlands province of Lam Dong died early on Mon 2 Feb 2004,
deputy director of Ho Chi Min City's Tropical Disease Hospital Tran
Tin Hein said. "He was admitted to our hospital on Thursday, and on
Saturday he tested positive for avian influenza A (H5N1) virus," Mr
Hein told the Agence France Presse news agency. "According to our
information he had direct contact with chickens in his village in the
Did Linn district," he added. Officials said the victim was from the
Coho ethnic minority group. The WHO has not yet confirmed the death.
2 other people in Viet Nam have also caught the virus, officials say.
A 4-year-old boy had made a full recovery, while an 8-year-old girl
was in stable condition, Mr Hein said.
In Thailand, a woman from the central province of Siphon Bury was
confirmed to have died from the disease on Mon 2 Feb 2004, Thailand's
Public Health Minister Sudarat Keyraphan said. 2 boys 6 years of age
died from the virus last week, and a 3rd child -- a 7-year-old boy --
was being treated at a local hospital, Ms Sudarat said.

Advice for Travelers
--------------------
With all international travel, consult a health-care provider 4-6
weeks beforehand for any necessary vaccines, medications, and
additional advice. Currently, CDC does not recommend restrictions for
travel to any of the countries affected by avian influenza A(H5N1)
virus infection.
Travelers to regions experiencing outbreaks of this disease in
poultry should avoid areas with live poultry, such as live animal
markets and poultry farms. Large amounts of the virus are known to be
excreted in the droppings of infected birds.
Influenza viruses are destroyed by heat; therefore all foods from
poultry, including eggs, should be thoroughly cooked.
As with other infectious illnesses, one of the most important and
appropriate preventive practices is careful and frequent hand
hygiene. Cleaning your hands often using either soap and water or
waterless alcohol-based hand sanitizers removes potentially
infectious materials from your skin [or kills them, respectively,]
and helps prevent disease transmission. This notice will be updated
as information becomes available.

Avian Influenza Fact Sheet
--------------------------
This Fact Sheet alerts Americans to the rapid spread of the avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus outbreak spreading across Asia. A number of
countries have reported incidences of avian influenza, commonly
referred to as bird flu. Thailand and Vietnam have reported several
bird-human transmissions of avian influenza thought to have been
caused by individuals' contact with infected poultry populations.
Although several deaths from avian influenza have been reported,
there has been no known human-human transmission of the virus. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health
Organization (WHO) are concerned about the potential for human-human
transmission of this highly pathogenic flu strain.
At this time, CDC and the WHO have not issued any travel alerts or
advisories for Avian flu-infected areas. CDC advises travelers to
countries in Asia with documented H5N1 outbreaks to avoid poultry
farms, contact with animals in live food markets, and any surfaces
that appear to be contaminated with feces from poultry or other
animals. The WHO does not at present conclude that any processed
poultry products (whole refrigerated or frozen carcasses and products
derived from these) and eggs in or arriving from areas currently
experiencing outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 in poultry pose a risk
to public health.
The WHO continuously emphasizes the importance of good hygiene
practices during handling, including hand washing, prevention of
cross-contamination, and thorough cooking of poultry products.
Americans who are planning travel to a country with an incidence of
the virus or who are concerned about the Avian flu are advised to
monitor the CDC and the WHO web sites for the latest information:
