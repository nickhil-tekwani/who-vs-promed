Herpes gladiatorum outbreak in Jersey City
------------------------------------------
An unusual outbreak of the herpes 1 virus [herpes simplex virus 1,
now renamed human herpesvirus 1] infection in five wrestlers has shut
down St. Peter's Prep in Jersey City this week. Days after a 30 Nov
2006 wrestling scrimmage among St. Peter's, Livingston and Nutley, a
Marauders wrestler had to be hospitalized after showing signs of the
virus, and four others were later diagnosed with the disease.
Human herpesvirus 1 -- not the sexually transmitted human herpesvirus
2 -- usually produces sores around the face, head and neck, and is
transmitted when skin contacts these sores. Abrasions are especially
fertile breeding grounds for the virus.
The infections are not the first instance of skin diseases breaking
out among North Jersey high school wrestlers. Ringworm and impetigo
have also struck wrestlers as a result of close contact with infected
opponents and possibly from contaminated mats.
"I have never heard about [getting] the herpes disorder this way,"
Passaic Valley coach Nick Zarra said. Zarra's team was scheduled to
travel to Nutley for a four-school match Saturday, but was still
awaiting word Tuesday evening on whether that match would go on or be
switched to Passaic Valley in Little Falls.
Lodi is scheduled to face Livingston on 6 Jan 2007, but Rams coach
Nick DiDomenico said he did not know the status of that match. "We
have been very lucky over the years," said DiDomenico, a 30-year
veteran in the sport. "Ringworm and impetigo are each very
contagious. I have never heard of herpes being transmitted this way."
St. Peter's Prep officials closed school Monday, and workers
disinfected areas of the school used by the wrestling team, including
lockers, showers and the practice room. All wrestling practices and
matches were canceled, although officials said they hope practice can
resume Saturday.

[Contrary to the statements in this press report, human herpesvirus 1
infections are not uncommon among wrestlers, rugby players and others
engaged in contact sports, with no single strain responsible for
outbreaks. The literature has been reviewed recently by Turbeville
SD, Cowan LD, and Greenfield RA. (Am J Sports Med. 2006
Nov;34(11):1860-5. Mar 27 2006). In the case of wrestlers the
condition is known as herpes gladiatorum (HG).
Anderson (Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2003 Nov;35(11):1809-14) concluded
from an analysis of the epidemiology and clinical analysis of several
outbreaks of herpes gladiatorum that the National Federation of State
High School Associations (NFHS) guidelines were inadequate to prevent
and control outbreaks of HG. The focus of preventive efforts needed
to change from mat cleanliness to more rapid detection of outbreaks
by requiring culture results and appropriate therapy for all
suspected bacterial and herpes lesions before allowing return to
contact. To minimize and control spread of HG, treatment and
isolation should be
implemented based not only on vesicle formation but also on systemic
signs and symptoms.
Anderson (Jpn J Infect Dis. 2006 Feb;59(1):6-9, Feb 2006) has
described subsequently the prophylactic use of valacyclovir (an
inhibitory nucleoside analogue prodrug) to prevent outbreaks of
primary herpes gladiatorum at a 28-day wrestling camp. The study
evaluated the usage of valacyclovir to prevent acquisition of primary
HG, due to human herpesvirus type 1, in high school wrestlers at a
28-day wrestling camp. At the beginning and end of camp, IgM and IgG
anti-HSV-1 antibodies were collected. Out of 332 male wrestlers, aged
13-20, who entered camp, 94 elected to participate in blood sampling.
Sixty-four were on antiviral medication. Among the 94 wrestlers, 28
(29.8%) had positive IgG anti-herpesvirus 1 titers. Of this group, 66
of 94, were human herpesvirus 1 IgG seronegative. At the end of camp,
55 of these original seronegative individuals elected to participate
in blood sampling and none had detectable IgM anti-human herpesvirus
1 or 2 antibodies.
Compared to previous years without antiviral usage, introducing
prophylactic valacyclovir reduced clinical HG outbreaks by 87% at
this 28-day wrestling camp. Due to the high prevalence of this virus
in high school wrestlers, Anderson recommended that serological
testing should be done at the beginning of each season. HSV-1
seropositive individuals should consider being on antiviral
medication throughout the season to minimize the risk of transmitting
the virus to other wrestlers. - Mod.CP]
