Bakkafrost today disclosed that its suspicions of pathogenic ISA [infectious salmon anemia] virus at one of its farms has now been confirmed.

The big Faroe Islands fish farmer said the problem was centred at the farming site A-73 Hvannasund Norour [Northern Isles], which has been under increased surveillance since July last year [2016], when routine tests resulted in suspicion of fish being infected by ISA virus.

After the original alert, extensive tests were carried out with the purpose of confirming these suspicions, but none of the results from these tests proved the presence of a pathogenic ISA virus.

However, more tests were carried out in January this year [2017], which again raised suspicions. These were at 2 cages, one of which was suspected last summer [2016].

Bakkafrost then decided to take immediate action and harvested all the fish in these 2 cages while at the same time keeping a close watch on the site.

A company statement said: "The accelerated harvest is expected to be finished by the middle of April [2017], and Bakkafrost maintains expected harvest volumes for 2017 to be 53 500 tonnes gutted weight, unchanged from the market announcement on 16 Mar 2017. The confirmation of pathogenic ISA virus at farming site A-73 Hvannasund Norour results in a prolonged fallowing period of 6 months at a minimum for farming site A-73 Hvannasund Norour, after the farming site is emptied for fish."

The discovery is plainly a setback for the company but one it can and has managed effectively. Three weeks ago, it reported substantially increased profits for the 4th quarter of 2016, with a total operating EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) of 349.6 million Danish kroners (DKK) [USD 50.6 million] compared to DKK 257 million [USD 37 million] for the 4th quarter in 2015.
