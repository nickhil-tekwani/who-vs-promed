Abstract
--------
Objective: To explore the causative agents of the atypical pneumonia (also
known as SARS) observed recently in some regions of our country.
Methods: Organ samples of 7 fatal cases of SARS were collected from
Guangdong, ShanXi, Sichuan Provinces and Beijing for electron microscopic
examination. The 293 cell line was inoculated with materials derived from
the lungs to isolate causative agent(s). The agents in the organs and cell
cultures were revealed by immunoassay.
Results: Both chlamydia-like and coronavirus-like particles were found in
electron micrographs. Inclusion bodies containing elementary bodies,
reticulate antibodies, and intermediate bodies of a chlamydia-like agent
were visualized in multiple organs from the 7 dead cases, including lungs
(7 cases), spleen (2 cases), liver (2 cases), kidney (3 cases), and lymph
nodes (1 case), by ultrathin section electron microscopy. In some sections,
coronavirus-like particles were seen concurrently. A coronavirus RNA
polymerase segment (440 bp) was amplified from the lung tissues of 2 cases
of SARS. After inoculation with materials from the lung samples, the 293
cell cultures were also found to have chlamydia-like particles. Since the
chlamydia-like agents visualized in both organs and cell cultures did not
react with genus-specific antibodies against chlamydia or monoclonal
antibodies against _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ and _C. psittaci_, the results
might well be suggestive of a novel chlamydia-like agent.
