There was a dengue outbreak in Dhaka, Bangladesh. At that time there were
lot of conflicting news about the outbreak. As a result, the Zoological
Society of Bangladesh issued a press note. The press note was issued to the
internet also. [I append the same press note again for your information.

[Dr. Chowdhury attached a long and detailed press note issued 6 October
1999. What follows is my summary of that attachment:
Both dengue and cerebral malaria have been clinically diagnosed in Dhaka.
Although from time to time it has been denied, both _Aedes aegypti_ and
_Ae. albopictus_ occur in Dhaka and in other areas of Bangladesh, often in
great numbers. Dengue viruses have not been isolated from these mosquitoes
in Bangladesh. All four dengue serotypes have been isolates in Bangladesh.
The main reason for the increase of _Aedes_ sp. mosquitoes in Dhaka is
thought to be linked to the storage of water for domestic use in low income
and slum areas, mainly caused by the absence of a proper and regular supply
of piped water.
Dengue in Dhaka was reported as early as 1964. At that time it was termed
"Dacca Fever". Dengue was also reported in 1977, 1978, 1982-6, and 1996.
During those years _Aedes_ mosquitoes were also present. In a survey
conducted in
1997 by WHO Entomologist Dr. A. Bruce Knudsen and Mr. Touhiduddin Ahmed,
_Aedes_ mosquitoes were recorded in Dhaka. They recorded a Breateau index
of 30.8 in Dhaka city. The Breateau Index is the number of positive
containers divided by the number of houses inspected. The recorded Breateau
index for Dhaka is well above the risk level for dengue virus transmission
by _Aedes_ mosquitoes.
Based on the situation, the Zoological Society of Bangladesh recommended
various procedures that would help control _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Apparently
there is no formal program to control _Aedes_ mosquitoes in Bangladesh.
There is a program to control _Culex_ sp. mosquitoes, ostenisbly for
Japanese encephalitis prevention and the Society suggested this program be
adjusted to include _Aedes_ control. The Society also called on the
Government to undertake public education programs.
In all, the Society's message was an informed and excellent summary. It
went on in a similarly excellent manner to discuss the biology of cerebral
malaria and made suggestions as to what should be done about this disease
in Bangladesh. Apparently, transmission of _Plasmodium falciparum_ in
Dhaka is at a low level, with most cases being imported from other areas of
Bangladesh and from nearby areas of India, where there is clear water
necessary for the _Anophelese_ sp. vectors to breed. Recommendation were
also made as to control of mosquitoes and of malaria in Dhaka.
I am personally saddened by the contrast between this excellent summary and
recommendations and the apparently appalling situation with regard to
vector-borne diseases in Dhaka in particular and Bangladesh in general. -

David Sack, head of the ICDDR,B informed me last December that Bangladesh
was experiencing dengue outbreaks. You may want to contact him or the
ICDDR,B for further information.

I was recently contacted by an Australian who had returned from Bangladesh
in early December 1999 with reported symptoms and serology indicative of
mild dengue haemorrhagic fever. From the reported history, this was
apparently a secondary infection and the infecting serotype was not clear
from the ELISA and HAI results.

[In sum, we still have no data, only vague reports. Still, dengue and
dengue hemorrhagic fever in a country as densely population as is
Bangladesh is a situation to be taken very seriously. At this time,
control is more important that serotype determination. - Mod.CHC
