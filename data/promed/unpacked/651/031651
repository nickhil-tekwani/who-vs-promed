A ban has been introduced on fishing for scallops in an area off the west
coast of Scotland after a build-up [of naturally occurring poison. The
Scottish Executive has taken the action following test results from the
government's sampling programme
which show that the Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning toxin has reached a level at
which there is a risk to consumers.
The species involved are scallops and queen scallops. No other commercially
marketed shellfish are affected by the move. The affected area covers 8000
square miles between the Outer Hebrides as far south as Islay and Jura.
There are believed to be around 200 shellfish farmers in the area affected
who send the delicacy across Europe.
At its worst the toxins can cause irreversible brain damage. If shellfish
containing the toxins are eaten, victims can experience vomiting, headaches,
limb numbness and memory loss.
The toxins occur naturally but government scientists are trying to discover
why such high levels have been found.

[According to the University of Kentucky Lexington articles on fish and
shellfish poisoning
(http://www.uky.edu/Agriculture/FoodScience/FSC632/fsc632sfish.html)
amnesic shellfish poisoning was first recognised in 1987 in Prince Edward
Island, Canada, where it was the cause of 3 deaths and 105 cases of acute
human poisoning. The amnesic shellfish toxin, domoic acid, is produced by
the diatoms _Nitzschia pungens f. multiseries_ and _Nitzschia
pseudodelicatissima_ which accumulates in shellfish and affects consumers of
such shellfish. - Mod. CYC
