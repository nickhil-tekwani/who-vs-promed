USA: Iowa Officials Concerned About Mumps Cases
-----------------------------------------------
State health officials have stated that they are concerned about a
rare strain of mumps virus behind an outbreak of 60 mumps cases in
Iowa. Mary Gilchrist, director of the State University's Hygienic
Laboratory, said the genotype G strain is infrequently seen in the
United States. With the number jumping from 17 cases just 2 weeks
ago, she predicted there could be more outbreaks this spring [2006].
"If the past predicts the future, it will get worse in April," she
said.
So far, there are 18 cases recorded in Johnson County, 16 in Dubuque,
5 in Black Hawk County and 4 in Scott County. 2 cases were confirmed
in Linn County, while other counties have one to 3 cases, according
to the lab's website.
The patients with confirmed cases of mumps range in age from 11 to
41, but Gilchrist said half have been college students. She said the
virus may have come from Europe, but a similar strain has been
detected in New Jersey. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention is investigating the source.
Symptoms of mumps include fever, headache and swollen salivary glands
at the jaw line, below and in front of the ears. Mumps is generally a
mild illness for healthy people and is spread through coughing or
sneezing. It can cause serious complications, including deafness in
children and spontaneous abortion in pregnant women.
A mumps vaccine was introduced in 1967. People born before 1957 are
believed to have been exposed to mumps during childhood and therefore
should be immune, according to the CDC. The last mumps outbreak in
Iowa was in 1987, when 467 cases were recorded. Since then, less than
60 cases have been reported annually, with only one to 3 cases
reported in the past 5 years.

[Mumps infection occurs worldwide, and humans are the only natural
host for the virus. Various vaccine strains have been developed and
have been effective in reducing the incidence of mumps worldwide. The
virus is essentially monotypic, although there may some mismatch
between individual strains and vaccines. Despite the monotypic nature
of mumps virus, different genetic lineages of mumps virus exist and
co-circulate globally. Genotypes A to J have been defined on the
basis of the nucleotide sequence of the most variable gene, the SH
gene. The different lineages are useful properties for tracking the
spread of mumps virus, but there is no clear association of the
different lineages with different clinical symptoms. - Mod.CP]
