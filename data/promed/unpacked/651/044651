From the beginning of 2014, 6 Belgorod residents have become ill with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [HFRS]. The epidemiological situation for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is unfavorable according to the regional management of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare].

[During the 1st 5 months of] 2014 there were 6 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, including 2 cases in Rakityansky district, and one each in Borisovsky, Ivnyanskom, and Novooskolsky districts and Belgorod. The epidemiological investigation found that HFRS infection in the 6 cases occurred through airborne dust during excavation in private backyards and preparation of hay.

[Belgorod is a city in the south of European Russia, the administrative center of Belgorod Oblast (region). Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a frequently reported disease in ProMED-mail. So, in ProMED in 2013-2014, it was registered in Mari-El, in the Primorsky Territory, Pskov, Khabarovsk, and Samara and Udmurtia. To prevent HFRS outbreaks, authorities recommended barrier rodent control, but often without allocating sufficient funds from local budgets. - Mod.NR

Mod.CP commented, "hemorrhagic fever with renal failure syndrome (HFRS) occurs mainly in Europe and Asia and is characterized by fever and renal failure associated with hemorrhagic manifestations. [HFRS] is caused by airborne contact with secretions from rodent hosts infected with the group of viruses belonging to the genus _Hantavirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_. In Europe, HFRS is caused by hantaviruses: Puumala virus (PUUV), carried by the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_); Dobrava virus (DOBV), carried by the yellow-necked mouse (_Apodemus flavicollis_)."

Although not stated in the report above, the cases could be caused by either of these viruses, as the geographic ranges of the 2 host rodents is overlapping in the Belgorod oblast.
