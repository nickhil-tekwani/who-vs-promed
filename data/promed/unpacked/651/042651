First Report of Beet black scorch virus in the United States.

In October of 2005, sugar beet (_Beta vulgaris_ L.) plants exhibiting
symptoms of rhizomania caused by Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV)
(3) were observed in a production field near Greeley, CO. The roots of 7
plants exhibiting moderate to severe symptoms characteristic of this
disease were tested using double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay with anti-BNYVV antiserum from rabbits. Of these, only
2 roots exhibiting the mildest symptoms tested positive for BNYVV (all
roots tested negative for the presence of the related Beet soilborne mosaic
virus (BSBMV). 'Hairy' lateral roots characteristic of the disease were
combined from the remaining 5 roots, ground in phosphate buffer, and the
supernatant from the suspension was mechanically applied to leaves of
_Chenopodium quinoa_ in an effort to isolate an infectious agent. Five days
postinoculation (dpi), yellow lesions with necrotic centers were visible on
inoculated leaves, well in advance of those typically observed for BNYVV or
BSBMV. Lesions exhibiting a similar rate of development on _C. quinoa_
subsequently were induced from extracts of root vascular tissue prepared
from 4 of 7 additional beet roots tested from this location. Transfer of
the infection from the _C. quinoa_ lesions to 32 healthy _C. quinoa_ and 10
sugar beet plants (hybrid ACH9369; American Crystal Sugar Co., Moorhead MN)
resulted in 100 percent infection. Inoculated leaves of _C. quinoa_
exhibited a high density of necrotic local lesions within 3 dpi, whereas
inoculated leaves of sugar beet exhibited pinpoint, necrotic to diffuse,
chlorotic local lesions evident by 5 dpi. Electron microscopic examination
of fixed, ultra-thin sections of symptomatic _C. quinoa_ leaf tissue
revealed aggregates of virus-like particles of icosahedral symmetry within
the cell cytoplasm. Following a virus minipreparation procedure, nucleic
acid extracted from the partially purified virus was found to be
single-stranded RNA by ribonuclease digestion and alone was infectious when
inoculated to _C. quinoa_ leaves. The apparently monopartite RNA genome was
3.5 kb long and a candidate for the single coat protein (CP) had a mass of
approx. 25 kDa. The sole reference set found in the literature for a virus
naturally occurring on sugar beet with similar characteristics was that for
Beet black scorch virus (BBSV), a virus recently accepted by the ICTV into
the genus Necrovirus within the family Tombusviridae (2). Prior to this
communication, BBSV has only been reported in China where it was first
documented affecting sugar beet in the late 1980s (1). Using the published
sequence of BBSV (Genbank Accession No. AY626780), DNA primers directed to
the 3(prime) half of the BBSV genome were used in reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction to produce an amplicon from the
unknown virus. Sequencing the amplicon revealed 88.8 percent nucleotide
sequence identity to the BBSV CP gene and 97% amino acid sequence identity
to the predicted CP gene product. Combined, the nucleotide sequence and
physical characteristics confirm the presence of BBSV in a U.S. sugarbeet
field for the first time. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of the
occurrence of BBSV outside of China.

[The crop plant sugarbeet, _Beta vulgaris_, develops symptoms of the
disease black scorch when infected by the virus beet black scorch virus
(family: Tombusviridae, genus: Necrovirus, BBSV).
BBSV was first reported in the late 1980s in China. The virus is
responsible for serious damage to the sugar beet crop in the Xinjiang,
Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Heilongjiang provinces of China. BBSV
infects sugar beet plants systemically through the roots after transmission
with _Olpidium brassicae_ zoospores and causes black scorch symptoms on the
leaves. Sugar beets are grown as a commercial source of sucrose
(sugar). BBSV can result in significant loss of root yield and sugar recovery.
This article describes the isolation of BBSV from roots of 5 sugarbeet
plants collected in the field in Greeley, CO. They had tested negative for
beet necrotic yellow vein virus, the cause of rhizomania disease which is a
common virus disease problem in the USA. Other plants from the same
field were infected with rhizomania. BBSV has previously been reported in
China but this is the 1st report in the USA and possibly elsewhere. It
remains to be seen if this becomes a major disease problem. The USDA is
seeking the development of a suitable test for BBSV (see link), which is an
indication that there are concerns.
The only sugarbeet virus posted in ProMED-mail is the unrelated beet
pomovirus Q.
