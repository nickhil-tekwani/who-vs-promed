More medical personnel, including 3 doctors from Kakamega Provincial
Hospital, have been dispatched to Webuye following the fresh outbreak
of swamp fever disease. The Western Provincial Medical Officer, Dr.
Olang'o Onudi, said yesterday, 6 Jul 2004, that 90 patients have been
admitted to the Webuye sub-district hospital in the last 2 days.
Onudi, however, described the situation as stable, and noted that a
team of public health officials were sensitizing the residents
regarding hygiene in an effort to contain the outbreak. The disease
has, so far, claimed 13 lives including 2 students of Chesamis High
School.
Onudi said that, of the 90 patients currently admitted to Webuye
hospital, 22 are students from Chesamis High School and 12 are from
Matulo Primary School. A pupil from the primary school died last week
[last week of Jun 2004]. "Most of those admitted in the wards are
under observation," Onudi said.
However, he said they were still waiting for the results of the blood
samples taken from the patients to establish the real nature of the
disease. He said that the symptoms of the disease include extreme
fever and headache. Onudi said diagnosis indicates that some of those
admitted were suffering from malaria and typhoid.
"We are retaining most of the patients at the wards because some of
them do not complete their doses after they are discharged," Onudi
said.

[If the new cases are shown to be leptospirosis, the source of the
outbreak (probably contaminated water) continues to be active. -
