Malaria turn worse in hilly Tripura Agartala
--------------------------------------------
Malaria has taken a turn for the worse in tribal dominated remote
hamlets under Chawmanu rural administrative block of Dhalai district
in North Tripura with 5 deaths reported. The death toll in diarrhoea,
viral fever and malaria has reached 129 so far this year in the area.


Officials here today said 7 special medical teams from the district
headquarters had been dispatched to the affected hamlets with
necessary medical aids.

Medicine, saline and instant malaria parasite testing kits were sent
from Agartala while 7 more doctors were posted in various primary
health centres in the area in the past one month to contain the
situation, said a top health official. He, however, pointed out that
scanty rainfall and humid weather were the main reasons for spread of
the diseases in hilly locations.

The entire Dhalai district had already been identified as malaria
prone and become drug resistant. Spraying of DDT, use of instant
diagnostic kits in high malaria prone areas besides, distribution of
115 000 medicated nets and fogging machines were on.

Alarmed at the increasing incidences of deaths due to malaria, the
Tripura National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDC) had
conducted a comprehensive study in malaria prone areas on
effectiveness of conventional medicines for malaria treatment.

The Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) categorised the state as
Chloroquine (malaria drug) resistant 3 years back and Salpha
Pyramethamine Combination, 2nd-generation anti-malaria drugs had been
prescribed for the patients.

The Plasmodium falciparum (PF) component present in malaria affected
patients and Chloroquine had become inactive for long-sufferers. New
chemoprophylaxis drugs had been supplied as an immediate measure, said
health officials.
