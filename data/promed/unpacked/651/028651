Prevention and treatment of artemisinin-resistant
falciparum malaria: update for international travellers
-----------------------------------------
_Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria, a
life-threatening disease, occurs in the tropics
and subtropics, in more than 90 countries, and
caused an estimated 863 000 deaths in 2008.1/

_P. falciparum_ is the predominant malaria
parasite in endemic areas of tropical Africa.
During the transmission season in endemic areas,
all non-immune travellers who are exposed to
mosquito bites between dusk and dawn are at risk
of malaria. Travellers' risk of contracting
malaria varies from country to country and among areas in a country. 2/

Prevention and treatment of falciparum malaria
with antimalarial medicines have become more
difficult because the parasite is increasingly
resistant to various antimalarial drugs.
Artemisinin and artemisinin-derivatives are
medicines used to treat falciparum malaria
strains that have become resistant to many
different drugs; they are the core component of
the widely used WHO-recommended artemisinin-based
combination therapies (ACT -- combinations of
artemisinin, or one of its derivatives, with one
or more antimalarials of a different class). WHO
now recommends the use of ACT as standard
first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. 3/

In 2008, the presence of P. falciparum parasites
resistant to the artemisinin derivative
artesunate was confirmed along the border between
Cambodia and Thailand. A 2-country, multi-partner
artemisinin-resistance containment programme is
under way in this area. 4/ Resistance to
artemisinin is suspected to be present in other
border areas of countries along the Mekong River,
5/ and these areas are being investigated.
Preliminary reports of emerging artemisinin
resistance in South America and some African
countries are as yet unconfirmed.

Currently, ACT remains fully effective in
achieving clinical cure and clearing blood stage
parasites, even in the case of infection with artemisinin-resistant parasites.

The emergence of artemisinin resistance on the
Thai. Cambodian border has implications for the
management of malaria in international travellers
to the following parts of south-east Asia:
western Cambodia, the border regions of Thailand
and Cambodia, border regions of Thailand and
Myanmar, eastern Myanmar, and the Binh Phuc Province of Viet Nam.

The diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated P.
falciparum malaria infections acquired by
travellers to these parts of the world should be
managed in accordance with standard
recommendations for malaria in travellers
published by WHO in International Travel and
Health 2010, 6/ including the recommendations for
standby emergency treatment. 7/

If infected travellers return or continue their
journey to an endemic country in another part of
the world, there is a risk of introducing
drug-resistant parasites to that endemic area.
This would take place through transmission of
gametocytes to local Anopheles mosquitoes.

Gametocyte development, and therefore transmission, are enhanced by:
1. an increase in parasite clearance time as
caused by artemisinin-tolerant or resistant infections, and/or

2. hyperparasitaemia which could result from delayed treatment.

To reduce the danger of introducing
drug-resistant parasites to other endemic parts
of the world, all malaria patients who have
travelled in the areas of South-East Asia named
above should be promptly diagnosed and treated
effectively (in accordance with International Travel and Health 2010).

The addition of a single oral dose of primaquine
(0.75 mg base/kg body weight, with 45 mg base
maximum for adults) to treatment will accelerate
the removal of gametocytes. Primaquine may induce
severe haemolysis in patients who are
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient, and
is contraindicated during pregnancy and in young
infants. It is recommended that measures be taken
to reduce the patient's contact with mosquitoes
(and thereby reduce the risk of onward
transmission of parasites); these measures
include using an insecticide treated mosquito net
and insect repellents between dusk and dawn.

self-administration of antimalarials (usually
without prior laboratory diagnosis) by
febrile travellers who are unable to gain access
to proper medical attention within 24 hours of the onset of fever.

[This report is very concerning, although our
previous report of artemisinin resistance at the
Thai-Myanmar border was withdrawn.

The driving force is under-dosing and counterfeit drugs. - Mod.EP]
