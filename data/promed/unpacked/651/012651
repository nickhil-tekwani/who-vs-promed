[For additional information on HPS cases, visit the CDC website at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/noframes/caseinfo.htm>. Among
other things, the website indicates that the case count was started when
the disease was first recognized in May 1993. In total 38 percent of all
reported cases have resulted in death. However, a total of 197 cases have
been reported since 1 Jan 1994, after the well-known 1993 outbreak had
receded. When this group is considered alone, the proportion of deaths
drops to 30 per cent. The temporal distribution of cases since 1992 shows a
major peak that corresponds to the outbreak that occurred in June and July
of 1993 in the Four Corners area (shared by Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico,
and Utah), where the disease was first recognized. The distribution
reflects a spring-summer seasonality for all identified cases, although
cases occur throughout the year. Cases of HPS have also been reported in
Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Panama, Paraguay, and Uruguay, making
this syndrome a pan-American zoonosis. - Mod.CP
