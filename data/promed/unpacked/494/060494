Occurrence of Cauliflower mosaic virus in different cruciferous plants in Iran

Surveys were conducted to determine the occurrence of Cauliflower
mosaic virus (CaMV) in cruciferous crops grown in Fars province of
Iran, during the summer and early autumn of 2003. Leaf samples were
collected from different cruciferous plants _Brassica oleracea_ var.
_acephala_, _B._oleracea_ var. _botrytis_, _B.oleracea_ var.
_capitata_, _B. oleracea_ var. _italica_, and _B. rapa_) showing
mottling, banding mosaic, necrotic spots, malformation and chlorosis
symptoms.
These samples were tested for the presence of CaMV by DAS-ELISA using
specific polyclonal antibodies (kindly provided by Dr S. Winter,
DSMZ, BBA Messeweg 11/12, As No. 0206 Braunschweig, Germany). Sap
from symptomatic leaves was used for mechanical inoculation of a
range of indicator hosts including, _B. rapa_, _B. napus_, _B.
pekinensis_, _Raphanus sativus_ (_Brassicaceae_) and _Datura metel_
(_Solanaceae_). All CaMV isolates tested induced mosaic symptoms on
the cruciferous indicator plants, however, one isolate (Ca-Sh1)
infected _D. metel_ systemically. All CaMV strains infect a wide
range of cruciferous plants but some are also able to infect
solanaceous hosts. The biological and serological data were confirmed
by PCR amplification of a DNA fragment of the expected size
(approximately 750 bp), corresponding to CaMV-gene II, using specific
primers.
CaMV is widely distributed in temperate regions and brassica crops
tend to become infected wherever they are grown. CaMV has previously
been reported from Iran on oilseed rape (_B. napus_).
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of the natural occurrence of
CaMV on _B. oleracea_ var. _acephala_, _B.oleracea_ var. _botrytis_,
_B. oleracea_ var. _capitata_, _B. oleracea_ var. _italica_ and _B.
rapa_ in Iran.

[CaMV is found worldwide, especially in temperate areas of the United
States and Europe. Its natural host range is limited to the
_Cruciferae_ (cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and others).
The main sources of CaMV are infected brassica crops or cruciferous
weeds on which any of several aphid species have overwintered. It is
often found as a mixed infection with Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV),
resulting in more severe synergistic symptoms than when either virus
is present alone. Disease management requires adequate weed control
and sanitation, especially the rapid plowdown of previous crops.
Transplant beds should be isolated from commercial crop fields and
overwintering cruciferous weed hosts. Symptoms of CaMV are often
confused with those of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). Resistance to CaMV
is found in most cabbage cultivars. - Mod.DH
