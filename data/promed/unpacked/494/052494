The number of people who have died from the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Uganda's Mubende district has risen to 12, according to health authorities, the Uganda Radio Network reported.

As of Tue [20 Sep] morning, the death toll stood at 8 people, but officials say that 2 more people died on Wed [21 Sep 2022] morning in the hospital while 2 others died in a village in Madudu Sub County, the same area where the first case was confirmed on Mon [19 Sep 2022]. The first 7 people, including an enrolled nurse, died before the outbreak was confirmed.

Dr. Emmanuel Paul Batibwa, the director of the Mubende Regional Referral hospital, says that 10 other people are currently admitted with severe signs of Ebola. He added that 4 contacts of a victim who died in the Kyaka refugee settlement have also been sent to Mubende hospital for screening and that their samples have been sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute.

Batibwa says that a team of taskforce members has been dispatched to the community to carry out surveillance and investigate the private clinics where the first patients were reportedly treated. He asked the public to be vigilant and take precautionary measures to control the disease.

Karen Besigye, the secretary for health in Mubende district, said that they have recorded 5 new patients from Kyaka II resettlement camp and that 3 people were reported dead in Kirwanyi village. She explains that surveillance teams have been dispatched to establish the cause of death.

Mubende resident district commissioner Rosemary Byabashaija said that plans are underway to limit events and gatherings as one of the measures to reduce the possible spread of the disease.

[Ebola is a serious viral disease that is fatal to humans, leading to fear and panic. It has been reported mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. It causes blood clotting problems. and is mainly transmitted from infected patients. Ebola virus disease has been reported in Uganda before this outbreak. - Mod.MA]

[Contact tracing, safe burials, and proper personal protection are going to be critical to control this outbreak as a vaccine against Sudan strain of Ebola virus is not available for use. - Mod.LK]

On [Tue 20 Sep 2022] the WHO announced an outbreak of Sudan ebolavirus was occurring in Mubende district, central Uganda:

"The Uganda Virus Research Institute confirmed the case after testing a sample taken from a 24-year-old male. This follows an investigation by the National Rapid Response team of 6 suspicious deaths that have occurred in the district this month [September 2022]. There are currently 8 suspected cases [see current case numbers above] who are receiving care in a health facility." https://www.afro.who.int/countries/uganda/news/uganda-declares-ebola-virus-disease-outbreak

Importantly, the only FDA-licensed Ebola vaccine is a one-dose vaccine that is specifically for the "Zaire ebolavirus" (previously referred to as a separate "strain" or "species" of ebolavirus) that has occurred multiple times since 1976, including the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and several recent outbreaks in the DRCongo e.g., 2018-2020.

Will a different Ebola vaccine (referenced below) that requires 2 doses separated by 2 months, be tested for safety, immunogenicity, and potential efficacy against Sudan ebolavirus in this outbreak in Uganda?

As the [Tue 20 Sep 2022] WHO announcement states:

"While ring vaccination of high-risk people with Ervebo (rVSV-ZEBOV) vaccine has been highly effective in controlling the spread of Ebola in recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and elsewhere, this vaccine has only been approved to protect against the Zaire virus. Another vaccine produced by Johnson and Johnson may be effective but has yet to be specifically tested against Ebola Sudan."

In January 2020, a WHO Q & A on Ebola vaccines including the following description of this 2nd vaccine that is notably given as 2 non-identical doses 2 months apart:
"In May 2020, the European Medicines Agency recommended granting marketing authorisation to a 2nd new vaccine delivered in 2 doses called Zabdeno (Ad26.ZEBOV) and Mvabea (MVA-BN-Filo) for individuals 1 year and older. The vaccine is delivered in 2 doses: Zabdeno is administered first and Mvabea is given approximately 8 weeks later as a 2nd dose. This prophylactic 2-dose regimen is therefore not suitable for an outbreak response where immediate protection is necessary." https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/ebola-vaccines.
