[The areas cited cover a fairly large swath of Northern Egypt. We
will await further lab and field results. - Mod.PC]
[The 2 suspected strains (A and SAT2) are indeed exotic to the region, and if
now present in 8 governorates they seem to have been there for a considerable
time, seriously threatening neighbouring countries. - Mod.AS]
