All 3 cases were males; 2 of the 3 were from Riyadh city, Riyadh region, and 1 was from Alasiah Al Qasim region. Two of the 3 were primary community-acquired cases with no history of camel contact, and the 3rd was a household contact of a previously confirmed case. A picture consistent with the endemic transmission of the MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. In addition, there was 1 recovery reported. At present, these 3 newly confirmed cases are the only active cases pending outcome information. - Mod.MPP
