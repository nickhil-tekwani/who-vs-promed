[2] Pakistan antivaccine reversed
Date: Thu 1 Jul 2021
Source: Pakistan Observer [edited]
https://pakobserver.net/bitani-tribe-ends-boycott-of-anti-polio-drive-in-jandola/


The dwellers of subdivision Jandola on Wednesday [30 Jun 2021] announced to end boycott of anti-polio drive and admitted their will to vaccinate their children against the crippling disease after a round of successful Jirgas (dialogues) with the Commander Frontier Corps' Sector Headquarters South (FC SHS) and authorities of the district administration.

The Bitani tribes of Jandola had boycotted the polio-eradication campaign after, they believed, their demands regarding inclusion of remaining areas in the compensation survey and unavailability of other basic life amenities went unheard by the authorities concerned.

Subsequent to polio drive boycott by Bitani tribes, a grand Jirga of the elders of Jandola was organized at FC SHS, which was attended by the sector commander SHS, Deputy Commissioner Kabir Afridi, Assistant Commissioner subdivision Jandola Naimatullah, and officials of police, health, and education department.

Moulana Haftay Khan and other elders of the area apprised the sector commander and authorities of district administration about their worries which, they said, led them to announce boycott of anti-polio campaign in the area.

[This article shows some of the reasons behind antivaccination stances, not related to the vaccine itself, but to other events (or perceived lack thereof) ongoing in areas. Antivaccine stances are not "one size fits all."

"The Bettani are a Pashtun tribe located mostly in Afghanistan and Pakistan. They are named after Shaykh Beá¹­, their legendary ancestor who is said to be the 2nd son of Qais Abdur Rashid. The Bettanis are Sunni Muslims of the Hanafi sect."

In Pakistan, they live in the FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas), specifically in FR (Frontier Region) Tank and FR Lakki Marwat. Jandola is considered to be the capital of the Bettani tribes.
