On 19 Jun 2006, a 15 year old female resident of British Columbia, Canada
was admitted to hospital presenting with respiratory failure. She died the
same day. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) was suspected. Three weeks
prior to onset of symptoms, she returned from Bolivia, where she took part
in activities on farms where rodent droppings were observed. She had no
known contact or exposure to rodents or rodent droppings after her return
to Canada.
Samples were sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory (Winnipeg,
Canada) for testing. Sera was found by ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent
assay) to be reactive against Sin Nombre antigen, and both lung tissue and
blood were PCR (polymerase chain reaction) positive for hantavirus. Given
the recent travel history to Bolivia, PCR assays were used that targeted
Andes and Laguna Negra hantaviruses. Sequence of these original PCR
products identified the virus as an Andes-like strain, and further sequence
data (open reading frames of the S and M segments) placed the virus in the
Andes Nort clade of hantaviruses, but with an as-of-yet unreported/unique
sequence most closely related to Oran virus and Lechiguanas virus.
Unlike the North American Sin Nombre hantavirus, in which person-to-person
transmission has not been documented, there have been limited reports of
person-to-person transmission of Andes hantavirus in Argentina (Wells, et
al. Emerging Infectious Diseases 1997; Martinez, et al. Emerging Infectious
Diseases 2005). Because of this concern, about 40 household and health care
contacts were put under surveillance for the development of fever and/or
other symptoms. After 6 weeks of surveillance, none of the contacts have
developed symptoms compatible with HPS. Two contacts with non-specific
symptoms were tested and found to be IgM, IgG, and PCR negative.
Surveillance of contacts will continue until 8 weeks post last exposure to
the case.
Since 1994, 9 cases of hantavirus infection (5 fatal) have been reported in
British Columbia, including this one and one other locally acquired Sin
Nombre case in 2006. All cases except the one described above have been
locally-acquired Sin Nombre infections. Enzootic foci of Sin Nombre virus
in _Peromyscus maniculatus_ (deer mice) have been found in several
locations in British Columbia (unpublished data, BC Centre for Disease
Control and National Microbiology Laboratory).
