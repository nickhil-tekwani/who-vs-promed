Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) intends to provide, from 4 to 9 Jan 2023, a response plan to the diphtheria epidemic, in support of the Ministry of Public Health, in the localities of Gouré and Tesker (Zinder region) plagued by this disease since mid-August 2022.

According to the MSF report, the health district of Tesker started reporting cases of diphtheria from 20 Sep 2022; [then] it was Gouré's turn. As of 22 Dec [2022], 40 cases have been treated and 14 deaths have been recorded in Tesker; in Gouré, we are talking about 479 people treated and 19 deaths.

Faced with this situation, MSF is planning a response plan to ensure curative quality care and prevention to populations exposed to the disease. The organization also wants to help reduce morbidity and mortality related to the disease in the health districts of Tesker and Gouré.

Taking into account the relatively calm security situation over the past 4 years at the departments of Tesker and Gouré, the teams will organize a mass vaccination from 4-9 Jan 2023 for children aged 11 months to 7 years and over. The target to be vaccinated is, for Gouré, 470 025, and for Tesker, 73 000 people.

To succeed in this campaign, awareness and mobilization messages were made to the population in mosques, churches, and markets. Radio spots were also broadcast via 3 community radio stations in Gouré. The objective of this campaign is to communicate and raise awareness about the seriousness and symptoms of diphtheria and draw attention to forgotten, but dangerous, diseases such as diphtheria.

It also aims to mobilize more actors in supporting the management of diphtheria cases and also in prevention, but also to increase MSF's acceptance in Niger as an independent humanitarian medical actor, intervening alongside national authorities to deal with crises.

[Niger (pop. about 25 million residents) is a landlocked country in West Africa, with over 80% of its land area in the Sahara; the capital Niamey is located in Niger's southwest corner (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger). Niger is divided into 7 regions, which are subdivided into departments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger#Administrative_divisions). Zinder Region, one of the 7, is the most populous region; Goure (pop. 318 861 in 2022) and Tesker are 2 of 10 departments in the Zinder Region (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinder_Region). Goure is also the capital city of Goure Department (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goure). Tesker (pop. 33 544 in 2010) is listed as a village and rural commune (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goure_Department). A map showing the location of the Zinder region can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zinder+Region,+Niger.

ProMED previously posted a report of this outbreak in October 2022 when there were 29 cases registered in Goure, of which 5 children had died (ProMED post Diphtheria - Niger: fatal, children 20221013.8706126). There are now 479 cases with 19 deaths in Goure, and 40 cases with 14 deaths in Tesker.
