Suspected Acute Hemorrhagic Fever Syndrome in Gabon
----------------------------------------------------
On Wed 19 Jun 2002, the Gabonese Ministry of Health (MoH) received
reports of 2 deaths of suspected acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome in
Zadie district, Ogoou-Ivindo Province in the north-eastern part of the
country.

On Thu 20 Jun 2002, a team from MoH and WHO (African sub-
regional epidemic response team) went to the village of Ekata to
investigate. Two suspected cases of acute haemorrhagic fever
syndrome were identified, as well as 31 contacts of these cases. Both
cases became ill while in Oloba, Mbomo district, the Republic of the
Congo and both died in Ekata, Gabon.

It appears that at least one of these persons was infected while caring
for a similar case in Oloba. It was not possible to collect samples to
determine the etiology of this cluster of cases. Health care workers in
Zadie district are following the contacts.

This same area in Gabon was the site of an epidemic of the Ebola
haemorrhagic fever that began in late October 2001.The last case died
on 19 Mar 2002 and Gabonese officials declared that the outbreak had
ended on 6 May 2002, approximately 2 incubation periods after any
possible contact with the last case.

[Cases of suspected acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome have now been
reported from both sides of the Gabon/Congo Republic border in the
same general area where outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever
occurred previously in late 2001/early 2002. The characteristics of these
new outbreaks of acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome are compatible
with a diagnosis of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, but this has yet to be
confirmed by laboratory tests, contrary to an earlier report. It is likely
that a reservoir of Ebola virus infection persists in this region and that
the declaration of an end to the previous outbreaks was premature. The
identity of the reservoir of Ebola virus remains obscure, despite the
isolation of Ebola virus from a non-human primate in this region. Both
human and non-human primates may be exposed to infection from a
common source, as yet unknown. - Mod.CP]
