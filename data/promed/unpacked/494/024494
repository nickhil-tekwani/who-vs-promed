From: Kate Torres <TORRESK1@WESTAT.com>

This story is somewhat dismissive of what would seem to be a rather
unusual if not completely novel occurrence. Would someone be willing
to comment on this situation, incidence of (or other evidence of the
presence of) tularemia in urban areas, and the known or potential
reservoirs in urban areas? Were any findings of investigations into
the similar situation in Houston in Oct 2003 made public?
Finally, I am curious about the statement about tularemia occurring
"naturally in soil." From my textbook understanding of tularemia,
any soil contamination, as from the presence of a contaminated animal
carcass, would be temporary and localized. Soil itself is not a
reservoir -- e.g., tularemia does not persist in soil in spore form
like anthrax or tetanus. Apart from the Houston incident, what
evidence is there of persistent tularemia in soil and how does it
persist?

[Regarding potential non-animate environmental sources of _F. tularensis_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Investigations into the cluster of pneumonic tularemia on Martha's
Vineyard (Feldman KA, Enscore RE, Lathrop SL, et al: An outbreak of
primary pneumonic tularemia on Martha's Vineyard. N Engl J Med 2001;
345:1601-1606), showed that primary pneumonic tularemia had been
reported in persons who disturbed the carcasses of infected rabbits,
in European farmers who worked with contaminated hay, in 2 boys who
mowed over a rabbit, and in a man who used a brush cutter to clear a
lot where many rabbits lived. In addition, they comment that lawn
mowing has been epidemiologically implicated in an outbreak of
psittacosis, in which patients were no more likely than controls to
keep, handle, or feed birds but were more likely to have mowed lawns
and lawn mowing may have aerosolized _Chlamydia psittaci_ shed by
sick birds.
Rodents can excrete viable _F. tularensis_ in both urine and feces, and
Feldman, et al. (ref. above) propose that on Martha's Vineyard, _F.
tularensis_ was shed in animal excreta, persisted in the environment, and
infected people after being mechanically aerosolized and inhaled. The authors
felt that the outbreak indicates that people can acquire primary pneumonic
tularemia from mowing in the absence of any obvious exposure to infected
animal tissue.
Regarding the environmental survival of the tularemia bacillus
--------------------------------------------------------------
Although _F. tularensis_ does not form spores, it can survive in water, soil,
and decaying animal carcasses. Feldman et al. (ref. above) reported that the
organism persists in water and mud for as long as 14 weeks, in oats for 4
months and in straw for 6 months. Although they were unsuccessful in culturing
_F. tularensis_ from environmental samples, the optimal methods for collecting
and isolating the organism from grass and air have not been determined. In
addition, they may have collected samples under environmental conditions that
differed from those existing when the patients were exposed. - Mod.LL]
[Regarding tularemia in the District of Columbia
------------------------------------------------
The disease is uncommon in DC, though it was common in the 1920s and
1930s among market men handling wild rabbits (from Jellison's text
"Tularemia in North America 1930-1974"). Indeed, Jellison stated that
by 1929, the District ranked 4th in North America in total cases of
the disease diagnosed, following Ohio, Montana, and Tennessee. [Given
relative sizes, DC seemed to be the highest in cases per square mile
- Mod.LL]. From 1948-1974, there were only 6 cases of tularemia in
DC. From 2000 to 2004, there were no cases reported in DC (from CDC
"Summary of Notifiable Diseases").
Back in 1978 there was an outbreak in DC of 3 cases:
Martone WJ, Marshall LW, Kaufmann AF, et al: Tularemia pneumonia in
Washington, DC. A report of three cases with possible common-source
exposures. JAMA. 1979; 242:2315-7.
Abstract: In June 1978, 3 cases of tularemia pneumonia occurred in
persons residing in the Washington, DC, area. The patients, all men,
became ill 3 to 4 days after a brief session training their hunting
dogs in an undeveloped wooded area adjacent to a housing complex. One
of the dogs, which later died, had captured a wild rabbit during the
training session. All 3 men had handled the rabbit while
familiarizing their dogs with the rabbit's scent. The men had no
other common exposure that was a likely source of infection.
