[Initially suspected to be anthrax - Mod.JW]
The common characteristic of livestock outbreaks of anthrax, and
specifically in cattle and small ruminants, is of animals being found dead
that had been fit the day before. Obviously this covers a multitude of other
diseases (eg chlostridial infections) and poisonings (eg arsenic), depending
on the management capacity of the owner, but with ruminant anthrax death is
sudden.
In our experience the textbook description of blood extravasation
from the nostrils, anus, etc, with anthrax carcasses is not seen on all
occasions and can be absent in many. Here in Louisiana carcasses rot quickly
and are consumed in a few days by maggots. Recently we have been presented
with a number of suspect anthrax cases that have brought home to us how it
might be mimicked by other diseases. It is extremely important to keep this
in mind when there is the suspicion of BW [biowarfare] or BT
[bioterrorism] events.
Here follows an account of widespread deaths of mature bulls, a
typical victim of anthrax, presently across southern Louisiana.
------------------------------
For the past week or so there have been increasing and significant numbers
of reports of adult cattle, especially bulls, being found dead or moribund
in the Gulf Ranges of this state ... that is within some 100 miles of the
Gulf Coast. Anaplasmosis, plant poisonings, and other diseases have been
ruled out. After discussing these reports with various veterinarians and
Steve Nicholson, LA agricultural extension service, the following
seems to be the pattern.
The deaths are associated with the present extremely high numbers of
mosquitoes, especially _Aedes sollicitans_, at levels not seen since 1962.
The affected animals are from small groups, such as small herds of up
to 6 - 8 animals or bulls (segregated from the cow herd). The recent heavy
rains after weeks of drought have resulted in the very high mosquito
counts. Whereas large herds can mob together and provide some mutual
protection from the mosquitoes, this is not possible with individual
animals or small groups. The animals have been seen walking constantly at
night to get some relief. The recent night-time temperatures have been
close to the daytime temperatures so that has added to the stress,
especially with the bulls, and chronic over-heating; we have been having
heat indices over 40'C. When animals have laid down, from exhaustion, the
mosquito infestations and worrying have increased further.
On examination the affected animals have pale to white mucous membranes; at
necropsy some have shown bloodless/white musculature. When haematocrit
levels reach 25 to 32% recovery is impossible. Shock is involved during the
terminal stages.
Some horses have been noted being similarly affected and with haematocrits
in the 25-28% range.
For those not believing this, refer to B Abbitt & L Abbitt, 1981, "Fatal
exsanguination of cattle attributed to an attack of salt marsh mosquitoes
(_Aedes sollicitans_)", JAmVetMedAssoc 179 (12):1397-1400 [15th
December, 1982]
