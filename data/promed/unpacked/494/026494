People travelling to South Australia's far north are being warned about
Murray Valley encephalitis. A man in the far north [of the state has
contracted the condition, which can affect the brain and leave victims in a
coma. The Human Services Department says it is the first time in more than
25 years that the virus has been detected in South Australia.
The department's Dr Robert Hall says it is transmitted by mosquitoes and
the virus is believed to have come from the Northern Territory or Western
Australia. "The risk is really related to the cases that have occurred in
the southern part of the Northern Territory and in Western Australia, in
just the adjoining areas of South Australia," he said. "So people in those
areas should take steps to prevent mosquito bites and
wear the right kind of clothing, long sleeves, long pants, use insect
repellent."
