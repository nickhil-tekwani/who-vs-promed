Outbreaks of influenza and gastroenteritis amongst pilgrims at World
Youth Day 2008
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Approximately 250 000 pilgrims from Australia and 120 000 pilgrims
from other countries from across the globe attended World Youth Day
2008. Initially, Pilgrims participated in gatherings across Australia
and New Zealand, then converged in Sydney for official World Youth
day events, culminating in approximately 400 000 people attending a
Papal Mass on 20 Jul 2008.

New South Wales Health detected a number of outbreaks of infectious
disease amongst pilgrims, including 30 outbreaks of influenza A and B
in pilgrim groups from Western and Eastern Europe, North America,
Southern Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific region, and 3
outbreaks of gastroenteritis in groups from France and New Zealand.

There is a risk of pilgrims returning to their home countries causing
outbreaks of influenza in those countries and we suggest that disease
control authorities and laboratories keep a high index of suspicion
for influenza, especially those countries in the northern hemisphere
where influenza activity would currently be low. We would be
interested in hearing from these countries if such outbreaks occur.

[ProMED-mail is posting this Request For Information on behalf of Dr.
Paul Armstrong of the Biopreparedness Unit of the New south Wales
Department of Health. Anyone able to respond should contact Dr.
Armstrong directly in the first instance. In view of the low
prevalence of influenza in northern Europe there may be a good
opportunity to assess the extent of transmission of influenza from the
Southern Hemisphere by Pilgrims returning rom the World Youth Day
event in Sydney.

Currently the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS) is
reporting essentially no influenza activity in Europe (see:
<http://www.eiss.org/cgi-files/bulletin_v2.cgi>). In week 26/2008
there was only one detection of influenza virus and in week 27/2008
there were no detections. A total of 12 countries reported an
assessment of the geographical spread of influenza activity in week
27/2008: none of them reported influenza activity. In weeks
26-27/2008, only one influenza virus was detected in Europe: in
Norway from a non-sentinel source. - Mod.CP]
