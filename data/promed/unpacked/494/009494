China: enterovirus 71 confirmed in another toddler in Hong Kong
-----------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection has confirmed enterovirus 71 in a
2-year-old girl, bringing this year's [2004] total number of cases to 33.
She has not traveled outside Hong Kong recently. The girl developed fever,
an oral blister, malaise, and lower limb weakness on 11 Sep 2004. Her
condition is stable, and she has been in Queen Mary Hospital since 18 Sep 2004.

Her cousin, a 21-month-old boy, developed fever, cough, and vomiting on 9
Sep 2004 and was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital on 11 Sep 2004. He
recovered and was discharged on 14 Sep 2004. Further test results are pending.

The Centre for Health Protection called on people to guard against
infection and to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene.

[It was commented previously that there has been a significant increase in
epidemics of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), caused by enterovirus 71
in the Asia-Pacific region, since 1997. Some recent HFMD epidemics in this
region have been associated with a severe form of brainstem encephalitis
associated with pulmonary edema and high case fatality rates. However, the
enterovirus 71 cases confirmed in Hong Kong this year [2004] have been few
in number and sporadic in distribution. For the present, ProMED-mail will
not continue to report these sporadic cases, unless there is evidence of a
developing outbreak. - Mod.CP]
