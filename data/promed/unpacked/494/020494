Measles in the Americas: New epidemiological update
-------------------------
According to the latest epidemiological update from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), emitted on [Fri 20 Jul 2018], a total of 2472 confirmed cases of measles have been reported from 11 countries in the Americas so far this year. The majority of the cases occurred in Venezuela (1613 cases) and Brazil (677), followed by the United States (91), Colombia (40), Canada (19), Ecuador (17), Argentina (5), Mexico (5), Peru (3), Antigua and Barbuda (1) and Guatemala (1).

Data show that since the last epidemiological update released on [Fri 8 Jun 2018], which reported 1685 cases, the number of cases has grown by 787, an increase of more than 45 percent. Over 92 percent of these were reported in Brazil and Venezuela.

In light of continued reports of imported measles cases from other regions and ongoing outbreaks in the Americas, PAHO urges all Member States to:
- Vaccinate to maintain homogenous coverage of 95 percent with the 1st and 2nd doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine in all municipalities;
- Vaccinate at-risk populations without proof of vaccination or immunity against measles and rubella. Examples of these populations include healthcare workers, people working in tourism and transportation (hotels and catering, airports, taxi drivers, and others), and international travelers;

- Maintain a reserve of measles-rubella (MR) vaccines and syringes for control of imported cases in each country of the region;

- Strengthen epidemiological surveillance of measles to achieve timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private healthcare facilities and ensure that samples are received by laboratories within 5 days of being taken;

- Provide a rapid response to imported measles cases through the activation of rapid-response teams to avoid the re-establishment of endemic transmission. Once a rapid-response team has been activated, continued coordination between the national and local levels must be ensured, with permanent and fluid communication channels between all levels; and

- Identify migratory flows from abroad (arrival of foreign persons) and internal flows (movements of population groups) in each country to facilitate access to vaccination services, according to the national scheme.

Additionally, PAHO/WHO recommends advising that all travelers over 6 months of age who cannot show proof of vaccination or immunity receive the measles and rubella vaccine, preferably the triple viral vaccine (MMR), at least 2 weeks before traveling to areas where measles transmission has been documented.

Measles in indigenous communities
------------------------------
Indigenous populations living close to the Venezuelan borders are particularly vulnerable to measles outbreaks. According to the epidemiological update, 126 cases were reported from the Yanomami communities in the municipality of Alto Orinoco, state of Amazonas, Venezuela, where there is currently an outbreak. The cases include 53 deaths probably associated with measles.

The states of Amazonas and Roraima in Brazil also confirmed 77 measles cases in Yanomami (and Ye'kuna) communities, most of them in the Indigenous Health District of Auaris bordering Venezuela.

First case of measles in Tachira, Venezuela
---------------------------

An 11-month-old infant came to the state with his family from the capital [Caracas]. They were Venezuelan people and headed to the border area when [measles] symptoms were detected.

The regional epidemiologist, Noel Calderon, reported that this is the only confirmed case in the region (Tachira state). While the infant was in the Andean entity, the relevant examinations were conducted, and the pathology was verified.

Similarly, in the area of Palo Gordo, Cardenas municipality, an individual's tests were sent to the National Institute of Hygiene to see if it would be a 2nd case of measles. However, after receiving the results, [measles] was ruled out, and it was confirmed to be chicken pox.

"Vaccination is the only way to prevent the disease," said Calderon. "The community is invited to go to the indicated centers as of Sun 29 Jul [2018], which starts the vaccination in the entire ambulatory network of the state."

The drop in the rate of childhood vaccination has put Brazil on alert, facing a major outbreak of measles in the north of the country, struggling to prevent the emergence of other diseases already eliminated, and trying to contain the spread of false news.

The authorities, with the support of the Brazilian Army, are going door-to-door through the humble neighborhoods of Manaus, the capital of the state of Amazonas, to apply vaccines against measles, even in the midst of some threats from drug traffickers.

The same is occurring in other cities of the country, including the state of Roraima, where there is also a migration crisis due to the exodus of Venezuelans who are fleeing the crisis in their own country and who have imported many of the cases.

In Amazonas and Roraima, 660 confirmed cases of measles have already been counted, and 2700 more are under investigation, according to official data. To these we must add the confirmed ones in Rio Grande do Sul (8), Rio de Janeiro (7), Sao Paulo (1) and Rondonia (1). The measles virus has thus found a fertile land, spreading within a local population that has relaxed vaccinating their children. Additionally, [the lack of vaccination] is a problem with some doctors who serve them, according to specialists consulted by Agencia Efe.

Immunization against measles, mumps and rubella, included in the triple vaccine (MMR), has been declining for 3 years in Brazil, with coverage of 85 percent in 2017, down from nearly 100 percent in 2014, according to data from the Ministry of Health. In some states, such as the impoverished Para, also in the north, only a 68.45 percent [vaccination rate] was reached last year.

The question is why fewer are vaccinated in Brazil when the rest of the world, in 2017, recorded a record number of vaccinated children (123 million), according to a study published by UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO). The answer, according to the Ministry of Health, is "the false assumption, in part of the population, that there is no more need to vaccinate part of the population, and even some health professionals."

Carla Domingues, coordinator of the National Immunization Program, stressed to Efe that "the population seems to no longer recognize these diseases as an important public-health problem," and, as a consequence, "there is a relaxation in the lack of vaccination."

It also puts the focus on health professionals, many of whom, for a generational issue, have never treated these diseases in their practices and therefore have not recommended immunization as strongly as in previous decades.

At the beginning of the 20th century, vaccine-preventable diseases, such as polio or smallpox, were endemic in Brazil, causing a high number of cases and deaths throughout the country. The constant vaccination campaigns from the government allowed the eradication of urban yellow fever and smallpox and the elimination of measles, polio, and rubella, among others.

"Today there is no such vibration in relation to the campaigns, which take place every year. Brazil did not stop, but the communication seems to be failing to make people understand that it is still important to get vaccinated," said Isabella Ballalai, pediatrician and president of the Brazilian Immunization Society (SBIm). In this "soup of factors" that explains the fall in the rates of childhood vaccination are also a harmful ingredient called "fake news" (false news), which concern the health authorities. "They circulate very quickly and occupy a space disproportionate to the size of those groups that propagate them," said Ballalai.

To combat misinformation, the association has promoted the portal <familia.sbim.org.br>, the 1st in Portuguese language certified by the "Vaccine Safety Net" of WHO.

The measles outbreak is already a "real risk" in Brazil. Polio, for the time being, "is a theoretical risk, but it exists," Domingues said, warning that in 312 municipalities, less than 50 percent of children were not vaccinated against this disease. Consequently, Brazil will carry out a national vaccination campaign against polio and measles from 6-31Aug [2018].

"Just having a community with low coverage and these diseases can go back there," said Ballalai.

"The vaccine is not an option; it is an obligation," Domingues concluded.

MDHHS [Michigan Department of Health and Human Services] has confirmed 2 additional cases of measles in Michigan for 2018. That brings the total to 4 this year [2018] as of July; Michigan had only 2 reported measles cases all of last year.

Neither of the 2 recent cases, which involved residents of Oakland and Washtenaw counties, were related to the 2 previous cases this year, but all 4 were the result of exposure outside of the country. This highlights the risk of contracting measles during international travel and the need for vaccination.

"Measles is easily spread, and these cases emphasize the importance of being up-to-date on all vaccinations for everyone's protection," said Dr. Eden Wells, MDHHS's chief medical executive. "The bottom line is immunizations are the best way to protect our families and communities from the harmful, sometimes deadly, consequences of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles."

Measles is a vaccine-preventable respiratory infection that can result in hospitalization, pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. The illness begins with a high fever, red eyes, cough, and runny nose and is followed by a red, raised body rash starting on the head and face that then spreads to the rest of the body. Measles patients often experience eye pain and sensitivity to light. Cases can be contagious a few days before the rash appears, which increases the possibility of unknowingly exposing others.

Symptoms can appear 21 days after the possible exposure. If symptoms appear, contact your healthcare provider promptly.

From 2001 to 2012, the average number of measles cases reported nationally per year was about 60, but it has increased in recent years. In 2017, there were 118 cases in the USA, including 2 cases in Michigan. The majority of people who got measles were not vaccinated.

To help parents protect their children from serious vaccine-preventable diseases, MDHHS has partnered with the Franny Strong Foundation in launching the I Vaccinate campaign. I Vaccinate provides vaccination facts for parents to make informed decisions about vaccinations.

Hull parents are being warned to make sure they and their children are protected against measles after more than 70 cases were reported in Yorkshire.

With 757 cases now reported in parts of the UK -- including 73 in Yorkshire and the Humber since January [2018] -- Public Health England is advising people travelling to Europe this summer to ensure their families are vaccinated properly before heading off on their holidays.

Large numbers of cases were recorded in Italy, France, and Greece as well as in Romania, Ukraine, Serbia, Russia, and Albania.

Janet Cairns, head of midwifery at Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, has also warned pregnant women to be extra careful, reminding people that catching measles during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or premature labour. "Now is the right time to check if you and your family are vaccinated against the risk of measles," she said. "GPs can advise and give vaccines to anyone who has not been adequately protected. Two doses of the MMR vaccine can prevent more than 95 percent of cases of measles, mumps, and rubella, which was known as German measles.

"If you are pregnant and have been in contact with someone with measles, which is infectious from a few days before the rash appears, please contact your GP or midwife, who can request a blood test to check whether you are immune."
