_Aedes albopictus_ in Nicaragua - correction
--------------------------------------------
Several readers have commented on the 23 Jan 2003 posting on the finding of
_Aedes albopictus_ in Nicaragua. It was mentioned in the moderators
comment that _A. albopictus_ had been found in Belize. According to our
inquiries, _A. albopictus_ has not been found in Belize.
We also mentioned in the posting that _A. albopictus_ was a more efficient
vector of dengue fever than _A. aegypti_. Several readers have challenged
this, and it should be emphasized that the increased efficacy has been
found only in laboratory studies.
