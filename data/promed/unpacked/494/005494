Prompted by fears of a new outbreak of one the world's deadliest scourges,
a World Health Organization panel in Geneva effectively decided Friday to
postpone eradicating the world's known remaining stocks of the smallpox
virus until at least 2002.
Virtually all member countries said they remained committed to the
elimination of the smallpox stocks as soon as possible. But the
recommendations of the World Health Assembly, the organization's governing
body, reflected widespread agreement that more time is needed to study
smallpox before it is irrevocably destroyed.
The assembly's recommendations are to be officially adopted next week, a
step that officials of the organization said was usually a formality.
In Friday's debate, representatives of 25 nations spoke, many of them
reluctantly affirming the need for a stay of execution for the virus. It
would be the third that the virus has received since the 191-member
organization decided in 1980 to destroy the known stocks.
Friday's resolution also calls for the creation of an international
committee of experts to advise on the need for further research and to
devise an eradication timetable.
The decision reflects a major shift in scientific thinking about smallpox
since 1996, when the assembly decided that the virus should be destroyed at
the end of June 1999. It also highlighted an unusual consensus between the
United States and Russia, the countries with the two remaining declared
repositories of the deadly stocks.
Washington and Moscow have publicly opposed eradication of the virus until
more research has been done.
Though smallpox was officially declared eradicated as a disease in 1980,
most officials now acknowledge that there are probably clandestine stocks
of smallpox virus throughout the world, and that retaining the virus could
speed the development of new drugs to fight a possible outbreak, whether
due to terrorism or other factors.
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, who led the American
delegation at the assembly, said the threat of biological terrorism, which
was "obscure" only a few years ago, had emerged as among "the thorniest
problems of the post-cold-war era."
Ms. Shalala said the growing threat required international health officials
to "change and adapt our response" and to coordinate efforts to "prepare
for an incident that we hope will never happen."
A turning point in official American thinking about the virus's fate came
in March, when an independent scientific committee concluded that research
on the deadly virus could provide important scientific and medical
opportunities that would be lost if it was destroyed. While that committee
was not asked whether the virus should be kept or destroyed, its
conclusions influenced President Clinton's decision to fight for at least
temporary retention.
Western and foreign officials said fear of a possible epidemic in a now
largely unvaccinated world and a recent report from a senior Soviet
defector had helped produce the new consensus against immediate
eradication. The defector said the Soviet Union had secretly filled
warheads of some of its intercontinental ballistic missiles with smallpox
virus, violating a treaty it signed in 1972.
In an interview this week in Washington, Lev S. Sandakhchiev, the director
of Russia's State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, where
smallpox strains are stored, would not comment on former Soviet germ
warfare programs. But he said he was certain that North Korea, among other
countries, was secretly keeping smallpox stocks.
Destroying the virus would complicate efforts to develop new drugs to
counter an outbreak, he said.
Dr. Sandakhchiev said an outbreak of monkey pox, a virus closely related to
smallpox, last year in Congo had prompted Moscow to redouble its efforts to
defer eradication.
The implications of that outbreak of more than 300 cases of a disease that
traditionally does not spread quickly among humans has been debated by
scientists within and outside Russia. The outbreak, he argued, showed that
a new form of smallpox might be evolving.
Donald A. Henderson, a former deputy science adviser to the White House who
led the campaign to destroy the virus, disagreed that the outbreak in Congo
suggested that smallpox was making a comeback in a milder form. Many of the
cases in Congo, he said, turned out to be chickenpox, not monkey pox.
He and other advocates of immediate destruction of the smallpox virus vowed
Friday to "continue fighting." They argue that little research has been
done since the disease was declared eradicated. They discount the notion
that governments will spend precious research dollars on studies of a
disease that no longer exists.
