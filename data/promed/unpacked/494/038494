French baby-milk maker Lactalis and health authorities have ordered a major international product recall because of fears of _Salmonella_ contamination following 26 cases of children falling sick in France.

Company spokesman Michel Nalet told AFP that "nearly 7000 tons" of production might have been contaminated, but the company is unable to say currently how much remains on the market, has been consumed, or is in stock.
