There has been an increase in campylobacter infections across the top of the south, public health officials say. Nelson Marlborough Health said in the last 4 weeks, 24 cases had been notified to the Medical Officer of Health, compared to a range of 6-16 cases in the same period over the previous 5 years. A number of known risk factors for campylobacteriosis had been identified in the people affected. These were: drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk or untreated water and contact with animals and/or nappies.

Nelson Marlborough Medical Officer of Health Dr Stephen Bridgman advised people against drinking raw milk and said it was risky for anyone to consume, but young children and babies, older people, pregnant women, and people with a weakened immune system were especially at risk of severe illness. The public health service was working with the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Ministry of Health, and the Institute of Environmental Science and Research to identify the reasons for the increase.

A single source cause was yet to be found, and investigations were ongoing.

Campylobacteriosis is a common water and food-borne gastro-intestinal disease caused by bacteria passed on in the faeces of infected birds, animals and humans. People who have a compromised immune system, the elderly, or the very young are at higher risk of severe disease, which rarely can be fatal.

[At least some of the cases seem to be associated with unpasteurized milk.

The following is from a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) information sheet regarding unpasteurized milk (http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/consumers/ucm079516.htm):

"Milk and milk products provide a wealth of nutrition benefits. But raw milk can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious health risks to you and your family. According to an analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), between 1993 and 2006 more than 1500 people in the USA became sick from drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk. In addition, CDC reported that unpasteurized milk is 150 times more likely to cause foodborne illness and results in 13 times more hospitalizations than illnesses involving pasteurized dairy products.

"Raw milk is milk from cows, sheep, or goats that has not been pasteurized to kill harmful bacteria. This raw, unpasteurized milk can carry dangerous bacteria such as _Salmonella_, _E. coli_, and _Listeria_, which are responsible for causing numerous foodborne illnesses.

These harmful bacteria can seriously affect the health of anyone who drinks raw milk, or eats foods made from raw milk. However, the bacteria in raw milk can be especially dangerous to people with weakened immune systems, older adults, pregnant women, and children. In fact, the CDC analysis found that foodborne illness from raw milk especially affected children and teenagers.

"Pasteurized milk" explained
----------------------------
"Pasteurization is a process that kills harmful bacteria by heating milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time; 1st developed by Louis Pasteur in 1864, pasteurization kills harmful organisms responsible for such diseases as listeriosis, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, diphtheria, and brucellosis.

"Research shows no meaningful difference in the nutritional values of pasteurized and unpasteurized milk. Pasteurized milk contains low levels of the type of nonpathogenic bacteria that can cause food spoilage, so storing your pasteurized milk in the refrigerator is still important.

"Raw milk and pasteurization: debunking milk myths
-------------------------------
"While pasteurization has helped provide safe, nutrient-rich milk and cheese for over 120 years, some people continue to believe that pasteurization harms milk and that raw milk is a safe, healthier alternative.

"Here are some common myths and proven facts about milk and pasteurization:
- Pasteurizing milk DOES NOT cause lactose intolerance and allergic reactions. Both raw milk and pasteurized milk can cause allergic reactions in people sensitive to milk proteins.
- Raw milk DOES NOT kill dangerous pathogens by itself.
- Pasteurization DOES NOT reduce milk's nutritional value.
- Pasteurization DOES NOT mean that it is safe to leave milk out of the refrigerator for extended time, particularly after it has been opened.
- Pasteurization DOES kill harmful bacteria.
- Pasteurization DOES save lives." - Mod.LL
