A 3 month Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has ended after claiming at least 49 lives, the country's health minister says. Felix Kabange said no new cases had been registered since 4 Oct 2014, though he warned against complacency. The country's outbreak is unrelated to the one in West Africa which has claimed more than 5000 lives.

Ebola was 1st detected in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Saturday's [15 Nov 2014] announcement came 42 days after the last new Ebola case in the country. Ebola outbreaks are usually declared over when 2 full cycles of the virus' 21-day incubation period finish without further infections. The outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which began in August 2014, had a high [case] fatality rate at 74 per cent.

While the epidemic involved a separate strain of Ebola to the one devastating West Africa, Mr Kabange said that his country "remains threatened by the possible import of the Ebola virus disease" from the region. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is the worst on record. The World Health Organization says 5160 people have been killed, and more than 14 000 have been infected.

[This tragic outbreak, with 49 deaths and a case fatality rate of 74 per cent, has behaved like most Ebola virus disease outbreaks since the 1970s. Its occurrence in a remote rural area, early recognition of the disease, and prompt institution of infection control measures contained the outbreak within a few generations, in contrast to the unremitting and explosive West Africa situation. While there are subtle genetic differences between the Ebolavirus Zaire strains causing disease in the DRC and West African outbreaks, there is no evidence that biologic differences in the virus account for the very different epidemiologic situations.

With the passage of 2 incubation periods since the last case, the outbreak can now be safely stated to be concluded. Better understanding of the wildlife reservoirs of the virus and education of communities in safe practices in game hunting and consumption may help avoid future introduction of Ebola into human populations. - Mod.LM
