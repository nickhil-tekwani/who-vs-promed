A mystery disease is killing penguins in Antarctica
-------------------------------------
Australian scientists have found over 100 Adelie penguins dead near their
Mawson base and fear there could be many more. It is not unusual to find 1
or 2 dead penguins in a colony, but such large scale mortality is rare. The
scientists fear that an unknown disease is responsible and are concerned
that it could spread. They have restricted human access to the penguins.
They are also disinfecting boots and clothing after leaving the area.
Blood and tissue samples are being taken from the birds and will be sent by
ship for analysis in Australia in the next few days. There are about 15 000
in the Australian colonies at Mawson and over 2 million worldwide. But
their numbers have been declining here in Antarctica and it is thought that
climate change may be to blame. They are losing some of their natural
habitat, the ice.
Keith Reid, an expert in penguins at the British Antarctic Survey, says
there is no cause for immediate alarm at the disease outbreak. "The
Australians are very concerned about the potential for humans introducing
disease into penguin colonies. But if this was an externally introduced
disease, it would go through a colony extremely rapidly." He said one
possibility was that skuas (Antarctic seabirds), traveling large distances
while scavenging around the oceans, could introduce disease into a penguin
colony.
It has also been a bad year for the thousands of Emperor penguins living
near the British base at Halley. The ice broke up early this year, before
the chicks were old enough to fend for themselves. It is thought most of
them have drowned or died of hypothermia.
Adelie penguins (_Pygoscelis adeliae_) are found on the continent and
islands of Antarctica. They are among the most abundant of all the penguins
in the Antarctic, so the species is under no imminent threat. They are 75cm
long, weigh 3 to 6.5 kg, and have a white ring around the eye. Their diet
is almost exclusively krill.

[A number of diseases affect penguins. There is not enough information from
this article to understand the clinical signs, other than death. Possible
diseases include fowl cholera (_Pasteurella multocida_) and Newcastle
disease, which can be devastating. With only 100 dead, it is unlikely that
a phytotoxin, such as a toxic algae, is involved. - Mod.TG
