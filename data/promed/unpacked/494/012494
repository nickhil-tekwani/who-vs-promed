China reports 2 outbreaks of foot and mouth disease
---------------------------------------------------
China has confirmed 2 outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in a rare
acknowledgement that the problem even exists inside its borders, an
international animal health organization said Sunday.

More than 200 head of cattle were destroyed after the outbreaks were
discovered, both in the eastern part of the country, the World Organization
of Animal Health said.

China's Agriculture Ministry reported the 2 [outbreaks] on Friday,
according to the organization. Both outbreaks happened [during April 2005].
One was in Wuxi city, Jiangsu province, where 15 cases were found and 183
animals destroyed.

The other was in Tai'an city of Shandong province, where 17 cases were
diagnosed and 40 head of cattle were destroyed, it said.

China has previously said instances of foot and mouth disease are
relatively rare, but some critics have argued outbreaks happen at much
greater frequency than admitted by the authorities.

One of the only recent outbreaks to have been recognized by China's animal
health authorities was in Tibet in 1999.

Outside observers suspect the country of being the origin of several
foot-and-mouth epidemics in recent years, including a 1997 outbreak in
Taiwan which was the 1st to strike the island in 68 years.

Foot-and mouth disease is a severe, highly contagious viral disease
affecting cattle, pigs, sheep and other livestock. It is not usually fatal
but causes severe losses in the production of meat and milk.

China's willingness to impose transparency in its health bureaucracy was
severely tested 2 years ago, during the outbreak of Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a lung disease affecting humans. China
initially claimed it did not have a major SARS epidemic on its hands.
Global pressure eventually forced it to face up to the extent of the
problem and admit it was the worst-hit country in the world.

In 2004, suspicions emerged that China was suffering from a similar lack of
transparency in its animal health bureaucracy, following the regional
outbreak of bird flu.

China admitted to having experienced outbreaks of bird flu, but denied any
people had died from it.

China Confirms Foot and Mouth Disease Outbreaks
----------------------------------------------------
China has notified international animal health body OIE of 2 outbreaks of
foot and mouth disease, the organization said in a notice posted on its Web
site.

China confirmed 2 outbreaks in late April in Shandong Province and Jiangsu
Province, the OIE said, citing information received on May 13 from Jia
Youling, director general of the veterinary bureau of the Ministry of
Agriculture.

China had not previously confirmed the presence of the highly contagious
disease, which causes severe weight loss in cloven-hoofed animals such as
cattle and hogs.

However, a Chinese government source said last week there was an outbreak
almost every year and that the government was working on a reporting system.

15 cases of foot and mouth disease were discovered and 183 cattle destroyed
in Huishan district, in the eastern part of the city of Wuxi, in eastern
China's Jiangsu Province, the report said.

Another 40 cattle were destroyed in the Daiyue district in the eastern part
of the city of Tai'an, in eastern China's Shandong Province, after 17 cases
were discovered there, it said.

Domestic soymeal prices have been soft recently, which traders attributed
to foot and mouth outbreaks. Soymeal is used as animal feed.

An official at one soy-crushing plant in Southern China told Reuters last
week that the presence of the disease among swine is "more serious" than in
2004.

The prevalence of small family farms raising only a few hogs or cattle
helps keep outbreaks relatively contained in China, an agricultural expert
told Reuters last week.

China plans to adopt control measures including "stamping out, ring
vaccination, quarantine, movement control inside the country and zoning",
the report on the OIE Web site said.

[The fact that China confirmed the outbreaks in those 2 provinces to the
OIE for the 1st time in many years (the latest were the 1999 outbreaks in
Tibet), there seems to have been a bit of an attitude change. It is
interesting to note that China seems willing to impose transparency in its
human and animal health bureaucracy. The outbreaks of Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) 2 years ago have killed at least 800 people
worldwide. China initially claimed to have no major SARS outbreaks within
its territories. Its admission of being the initial and the worst-hit
country only came belatedly and under enormous global pressure. The
suspected outbreaks in Wanyuan in Sichuan province [Foot & mouth disease -
China :sus 20050512.1297] remain unconfirmed. China was suspected by
outside observers to be the origin of many FMD epidemics, such as the 1997
outbreaks in Taiwan, which were the 1st to strike the island in 68 years.

Soybeans are crushed into round cakes, each weighing from 50 to 100 kg, for
pig feed. An official at one soy-crushing plant in Southern China told
Reuters that swine are more seriously affected this year than in the
past. This implies that the weakness of domestic soymeal prices may
reflect the severity of the FMD epidemics. In other words, there is less
demand for feed owing to the lower number of pigs. - Mod.RY]

[From a source generally known to us as reliable, we received the following
information on 16 May 2005: "Besides the rumors of FMD in Sichuan, a
contact told us about an outbreak of FMD in a village in Yanqing district,
Beijing. This has not been confirmed from other sources".

Confirmation (to include data on affected species) or, hopefully, denial of
this anecdotal piece of information will contribute to transparency. - Mod.AS]
