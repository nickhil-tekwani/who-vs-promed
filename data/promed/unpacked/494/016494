Rabid hamsters caused an epidemic in Voronej (Russia)
-----------------------------------------------------
A rabies outbreak has been registered in Ostrogojskiy rayon of the city of
Voronej. According to the Voronej epidemiological surveillance center, there
are already 19 animals [which species?] with a confirmed diagnosis of
rabies, while 135 people have been admitted to the health facility to get
anti rabies [post-exposure] vaccination.
The last [among the treated people] was a 4-year-old child bitten by a
hamster [see comment]. The child is currently getting anti-rabies vaccine.
The hamster was bought in a zoo. When investigated, several animals
[hamsters?!] were found having rabies.
At the present time, officials are identifying people who bought animals
from the zoo shop.

[It is not clear whether the outbreak described has been detected
exclusively in hamsters, or just in one hamster among other
affected/suspected animals. If the latter scenario is confirmed, the title
might be misleading. Clarification, including details of laboratory
investigations -- if carried out -- in the suspected hamster, and results of
the epidemiological investigations in the zoo shop, will be helpful.
Natural rabies infection in hamsters (and in rodents in general) are highly
exceptional. One incident was described in Slovakia in 1984; see S. Svrcek
et al, 1984. Rabies in the common hamster (_Cricetus cricetus_) in Slovakia;
Vet Med (Praha). 29(11):643-52. There had been an earlier, similar
observation from the same geographical region. - Mod.AS]
[Rodents in general do not develop rabies because they do not survive the
effects of the bite from the rabid dog or cat that gave it to them. - Mod.JW]
