[Since the start of the LPAI H7N9 event in (Eastern) China, a total of 38 "outbreaks" in animals have been reported to the OIE. The vast majority of them (36) took place in live animal markets, where positive samples were derived from 2 sources: either collected from various poultry species , such as, chicken, duck, goose, quail, pigeon, or "environmental" samples, such as, swabs and collected excretions. Only 2 of the 38 "outbreaks" were recorded on farms. These were:

1. A single pigeon at a pigeon farm in Haian County of Jiangsu Province (covered by ProMED-mail in postings 20130422.1664423 and 20130426.1674487; reported by China to the OIE in follow-up report no 4 of 22 Apr 2013, available at http://tinyurl.com/qcoc3sj.

2. A commercial farm in Guangdong (see outbreak 3 in follow-up report no 15, above). This farm was visited and tested because it was identified as the origin of a chicken imported to Macau and found there as H7N9-infected on 12 Mar 2014 (see ProMED-mail 20140323.2351275).

A summary of all 38 outbreaks, with an interactive map, is available at http://tinyurl.com/kdu3zxo. Zooming in will allow the recognition of the 11 provinces reportedly affected (in brackets, number of reported "outbreaks"): Shanghai (3), Jiangsu (5), Anhui (1), Zhejiang (7), Henan (2). Shandong (1), Jiangxi (1), Guangdong (10), Fujian (2), Hunan (5) and Guangxi (1). The list is arranged chronologically according to the order of initial virus detection in the respective province.

Information involving "serological surveillance" and "pathogen monitoring" in all of China's provinces during the months of September 2013 to March 2014, is available at China's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) website. The following periodic reports (in Chinese) have been kindly downloaded and submitted to us by Henry Huang, who is gratefully acknowledged.

The reports above include also information, which is complementary to that supplied in OIE reports. Examples:

1. In the province Qinghai, during each of the months of September, October, and November 2013, 65 out of the total of 441 serum samples tested, were positive (14.23 percent).

2. In September 2013, there were 10 positive "pathogen monitorings" in Hebei (out of 1000 samples, namely 1.0 percent). Hebei was the site of H7N9 discovery in wild birds.

The MOA reports do not differentiate between the various source(s) of the samples (environmental, animal-derived in markets, their species, poultry farms -- commercial, backyard). Such information is essential for the further study of the LPAI H7N9 epidemiology in animals in China. - Mods.CRD/AS
