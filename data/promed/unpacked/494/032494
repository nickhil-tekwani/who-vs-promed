Some 1500 dogs bred for their raccoon-like fur have died after eating
feed tainted with the same chemical that contaminated dairy products
and sickened tens of thousands of babies nationwide, a veterinarian
said Monday [20 Oct 2008].

The raccoon dogs -- a breed native to east Asia whose fur is used to
make trim on coats and other clothing -- were fed a product that
contained the chemical melamine and developed kidney stones, said
Zhang Wenkui, a veterinary professor at Shenyang Agriculture
University. All of the dogs died on farms in just one village.

Zhang determined that the animals died of kidney failure after
performing a necropsy -- an animal autopsy -- on about a dozen dogs.
He declined to say when the deaths occurred, but a report Monday [20
Oct 2008] in the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper said they had
occurred over the past 2 months.

"1st, we found melamine in the dogs' feed, and 2nd, I found that 25
percent of the stones in the dogs' kidneys were made up of melamine,"
Zhang told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.

The Southern Metropolis Daily also blamed the deaths of several
hundred dogs on melamine, but it was not immediately clear how the
chemical would have entered the raccoon dog feed. In the ongoing milk
scandal, melamine was said to be added to watered-down milk to
artificially boost nitrogen levels, making products seem higher in
protein when tested.

The animal deaths raise questions about the extent of the chemical's
presence in the country's food chain.

Melamine has been found in a wide range of Chinese-made dairy
products and foods with milk ingredients over the past few months.
The government is still trying to win back consumer confidence after
those tainted products turned up on store shelves around the world.

Four Chinese babies' deaths have been blamed on infant formula that
was laced with melamine. Some 54 000 other children were sickened.

Last year [2007], melamine-tainted wheat gluten, a pet food
ingredient made in China, was blamed for the deaths of dozens of dogs
and cats in North America.

When ingested by humans, the industrial chemical -- used in plastics
and fertilizers -- can cause kidney stones as the body tries to
eliminate it and, in extreme cases, can lead to kidney failure.
Infants are particularly susceptible.

Zhang said the company that produces the animal feed is in talks with
breeders in Xishan, the village in Liaoning province where the dogs
died, about providing compensation and has pressured them not to talk
to the media.

Zhang did not give the company's name, but the newspaper report said
the feed was produced by Harbin Hualong Feed Co. The company refused
to comment Monday [20 Oct 2008], saying officials were unavailable
because they were in a meeting.

An official surnamed Liu at the Liaoning provincial animal feed and
medicine inspection center said the facility tested one sample of
animal feed from Xishan and found that it contained about 500 parts
per million of melamine. China's Health Ministry recently capped the
amount of melamine permissible in milk, milk powder and food products
that contain more than 15 percent dairy to 2.5 parts per million.

He said that the center was assisting the Ministry of Agriculture in
a nationwide inspection of animal feed for similar contamination but
would not give any other details.

The ministry did not respond to a list of faxed questions. Telephone
calls to the agricultural department of the Ciyutuo county
government, which oversees Xishan, rang unanswered.

China's products have been under intense scrutiny after high levels
of industrial toxins were found last year [2007] in exports ranging
from toothpaste to toys.

The milk scandal has resulted in recalls and the blocking of Chinese
imports in numerous countries.

On Monday [20 Oct 2008], Australia said it had ordered a recall of a
milk drink and cake brand after tests showed they were contaminated
with melamine.

Lydia Buchtmann, a spokeswoman for Food Standards Australia New
Zealand, said Orion brand Tiramisu Italian Cake with Cheese Cream and
Dali Yuan brand First Milk vanilla-flavored drink have been taken off
store shelves.

[Melamine is certainly not the innocent source of non-protein
nitrogen the Chinese producers wanted the pet owners to believe last
year (2007). Now, China has experienced the impact of melamine
adulteration of food products in human infants and in dogs. According
to the above newswires, the death of the dogs had a direct economic
impact as they were bred for an industry as opposed to the combined
emotional and economic impact of the illness and deaths in infants
and pet animals. - Mod.TG]
