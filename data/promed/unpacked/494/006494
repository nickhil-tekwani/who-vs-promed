The Supreme Council of Health and the Ministry of Environment in collaboration with the National Institute of Public Health and Environment (RIVM) of the Ministry of Health and the Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands announced confirmation of the 1st cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 3 camels in a herd in Qatar, in a barn, which are linked to 2 confirmed human cases who have since then recovered.

For transparency purposes, we can confirm that the 3 camels were investigated among a herd of 14 camels, and the samples were collected as part of the epidemiological investigation in coordination between the Public Health Department and the Department of Animal Resources. It is to be noted that none of the 14 camels showed any sign of disease when the samples were collected. As a precautionary measure, the 14 camels were put in quarantine since the initial sampling and after 40 days as of now, none have shown any symptom or sign of the disease.

For information, the presence of the MERS-CoV is newly recognized among animals and currently there is neither a clear scientific case definition nor enough information as to the role animals may play in transmitting and spreading the disease.

All contacts of the 2 recovered MERS-CoV cases, including relatives, friends, and workers in the same barn have been screened, with negative results. The 2 Departments are following up with the reference laboratory and Erasmus Medical Centre to test additional samples from other animal species and from the environment of the barn. The joint team of the Supreme Council of Health and the Department of Animal Resources is continuously monitoring the development of this disease and taking all necessary measures to prevent the spread of the disease.

This discovery came as a result of the collaborative efforts between the 2 ministries, and the RIVM laboratory and Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands, together with the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently the 2 Departments are conducting a national survey to investigate the presence of virus in animals, humans, and the environment, and the potential modes of transmission and exposure to the virus among humans who are in close contact with animals. Until more information is available, it is recommended that, as a precautionary measure, any animals that have been in close contact with newly detected human MERS-CoV cases be separated for investigation of the presence of infection with the virus.

It is also recommended that people with underlying health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, respiratory disease, the immunosuppressed and the elderly, avoid any close animal contacts when visiting farms and markets, and to practice good hygiene, such as washing hands.

Health officials in Qatar have announced they have found MERS or a MERS-like virus in 3 camels. The camels were from a single farm where 2 men also contracted the virus.

The finding provides further evidence that camels can at the very least be infected with MERS or a very similar virus.

But it does not prove camels are driving the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which is a cousin of the virus that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak.

Recently officials from Saudi Arabia also reported a similar finding from a single camel in that country.

The World Health Organization has confirmed 160 infections with the new virus, all in or linked to 6 countries in the Middle East.

"This is our 1st clue which further fills out the whole story," says Bart Haagmans, a Dutch virologist who is involved in the effort to test the camel specimens. "But there's more work to do, especially on routes of transmission."

Haagmans, who is with Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, says the team believes the findings are solid. They used 3 different tests, and found multiple fragments of viral RNA. As well, the camels have developed antibodies to MERS, or a MERS-like virus, he says. Sequencing of that material is ongoing.

It has been reported that other types of animals were also present on the farm. Haagmans says testing of specimens from other animals is still under way.

While the working hypothesis is the virus originated in bats, scientists have been trying to figure out how people are becoming infected with it.

The assumption has been that one or perhaps several species of animals contracted the bat virus and are now spreading it among themselves and occasionally to humans.

A lot of attention has focused on camels. From time to time there have been reports that a person who became infected owned camels or attended camel races. But the WHO says many of the people who have contracted this virus reported no contact with the beasts.

Earlier this year [2013] European researchers reported finding antibodies to MERS or a similar virus in camels from Oman, the Canary Islands, and Egypt.

But antibodies signal prior infection. To confirm that camels play a role in this story, science needs evidence of current infection.

Even with these findings, much of the puzzle remains to be completed. How are people contracting this virus? What puts them at risk? And what portion of cases involve animal-to-human spread at this point?

"For sure there is a part of the outbreak that is caused by human-to-human transmission," says Haagmans. "The question is, what is the fraction of these cases? And how many independent introductions do you have through zoonotic -- from an animal -- transmission?"

The team involved in this work -- from Qatar, the WHO, and the Netherlands -- is working on a scientific paper to lay out their findings.

[As rightly indicated in the official report of the Qatar health authority (item 1 above), "the presence of the MERS-CoV [antibodies?] is newly recognized among animals, and currently there is neither a clear scientific case definition nor enough information as to the role animals may play in transmitting and spreading the disease." This is also the current view of the OIE, namely: "Serology tests for MERS-CoV have not yet been validated in animals and may not be reliable. If these tests, which may not be sufficiently specific, are used in animals, there is a risk that 'false positive' results will occur because it may not be possible to differentiate antibodies to MERS-CoV from antibodies to other coronaviruses, commonly found in animals. That is why tests in animals should focus on isolating and identifying the virus itself" (see ProMED-mail 20131119.2064239).

As apparent from item 2 above, the discovery of the 3 camel "cases" in Qatar is based upon serological tests; more specifically, "3 different tests" applied by the Dutch investigators. Further details of the techniques applied and on their respective validation status will be helpful.

On 12 Nov 2013, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health notified the 1st time that a camel related to a human case had tested positive for MERS-CoV by PCR (see ProMED-mail 20131112.2051424). Reportedly, further testing was ongoing to sequence the patient's and the camel's viruses and compare genetic similarity levels to conclude causality. The results of these tests are not yet available. - Mod.AS\
