[1] CDC update
Date: Thu 19 Aug 2010

<http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/enteritidis/>


CDC is collaborating with public health officials in multiple states,
the FDA, and the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service to
investigate a nationwide increase of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Enteritidis (SE) infections with an indistinguishable pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern JEGXX01.0004. This is the most
common PFGE pattern for SE in the PulseNet database. Investigators
are using DNA analysis of Salmonella bacteria obtained through
diagnostic testing to identify cases of illness that may be part of
this outbreak. Because the outbreak PFGE pattern (outbreak strain)
commonly occurs in the USA, some of the cases identified with this
outbreak strain may not be related to this outbreak.

Investigation of the Outbreak
----------------------------
In May 2010, CDC identified a nationwide increase in the number of
_S._ Enteritidis isolates with PFGE pattern JEGXX01.0004 uploaded to
PulseNet, the national subtyping network made up of state and local
public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories
that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections. This
increase is evident in the epidemic curve, or epi curve.

During 1 May to 31 Jul 2010, a total of 1953 illnesses were reported.
However, some of these cases may not be related to this outbreak.
Based on the previous 5 years of reports to PulseNet, we would expect
approximately 700 illnesses during this same period. Many states have
reported increases of this pattern since May 2010. Because of the
large number of expected cases during this period, standard methods
of molecular subtyping alone are not sufficient to determine which
reported cases might be outbreak-associated. CDC is currently
conducting testing using advanced molecular methodologies to help
distinguish between outbreak-related cases and sporadic (or background) cases.

Illnesses that occurred after 17 Jul 2010 might not yet be reported
due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when
the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 3 weeks for
_Salmonella_.

Epidemiologic investigations conducted by public health officials in
10 states since April 2010 have identified 26 restaurants or events
where more than a single ill person with the outbreak strain has
eaten. Data from these investigations suggest that shell eggs are a
likely source of infections in many of these restaurants or events.
Preliminary information indicates that Wright County Egg, in Galt,
IA, was an egg supplier in 15 of these 26 restaurants or events.

A formal traceback conducted by state partners in California,
Colorado, and Minnesota, in collaboration with FDA and CDC, found
that shell eggs from 5 of these restaurants or events were from a
single firm, Wright County Egg in Galt, IA. FDA is currently
conducting an extensive investigation at the firm. The investigation
includes CDC participation and involves sampling, records review and
looking for potential sources of contamination, such as feed. The
investigation continues, and updates will be made available.

Recall Information
-----------------
On 13 Aug 2010, Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa conducted a
nationwide voluntary recall of shell eggs. On 18 Aug 2010, Wright
County Egg expanded its recall [which is now for over 380 000 000 shell eggs.

[2] Expanded recall
Date: Wed 18 Aug 2010

<http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm223139.htm>


Wright County Egg of Galt, IA is expanding its voluntary recall
(original recall date: 13 Aug 2010) of specific Julian dates of shell
eggs produced by their farms because they have the potential to be
contaminated with _Salmonella_.

Eggs affected by the expanded recall were distributed to food
wholesalers, distribution centers and foodservice companies in
California, Arizona, Missouri, Minnesota, Texas, Georgia, Washington,
Oregon, Colorado, Nevada, Iowa, Illinois, Utah, Nebraska, Arkansas,
Wisconsin and Oklahoma. These companies distribute nationwide.

Eggs are packaged under the following brand names: Albertsons, Farm
Fresh, James Farms, Glenview, Mountain Dairy, Ralphs, Boomsma, Lund,
Kemps and Pacific Coast. Eggs are packed in varying sizes of cartons
(6-egg cartons, dozen egg cartons, 18-egg cartons, and loose eggs for
institutional use and repackaging) with Julian dates ranging from 136
to 229 and plant numbers 1720 and 1942.

Dates and codes can be found stamped on the end of the egg carton or
printed on the case label. The plant number begins with the letter P
and then the number. The Julian date follows the plant number, for
example: P-1720 223.

Eggs under the 13 Aug 2010 recall are packaged under the following
brand names: Lucerne, Albertson, Mountain Dairy, Ralph's, Boomsma's,
Sunshine, Hillandale, Trafficanda, Farm Fresh, Shoreland, Lund, Dutch
Farms and Kemps. Eggs are packed in varying sizes of cartons (6-egg
cartons, dozen egg cartons, 18-egg cartons, and loose eggs for
institutional use and repackaging) with Julian dates ranging from 136
to 225 and plant numbers 1026, 1413 and 1946.

[The scope of this outbreak is increasing. ProMED awaits more
information regarding better diagnostic studies of the outbreak
strain. It cannot be stressed enough, in parallel to _E. coli_
O157:H7 in ground beef, that almost all cases can be avoided with
proper cooking and kitchen hygiene. - Mod.LL]
