Avian, human flu coinfection reported in Indonesian teenager
------------------------------------------------------------
An Indonesian teenager has been brought forward as a case of
simultaneous infection with seasonal and avian strains of influenza
-- a possibility that health planners have long warned could give
rise to a pandemic flu strain. In a paper presented today [Mon 17 Mar
2008] at the International Conference on Emerging Infectious
Diseases, Vivi Setiawaty of Indonesia's Center for Biomedical and
Pharmaceutical Research and Development described the case of a
16-year-old girl who was tested for flu in Jakarta in April 2007
under a flu-surveillance system established in 2005 by the Indonesian
Ministry of Health. The girl, who had been experiencing flu symptoms
for several days, was only mildly ill, with a 100.5 DEGF fever, sore
throat, cough, headache, and body aches, but no difficulty breathing
and no signs of pneumonia. (Case reports of H5N1 patients in
countries such as Thailand have described more dramatic clinical
presentations.)

Throat and nasal-swab samples that were taken on the 6th day of her
symptoms tested positive by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) for both avian influenza H5N1 and the seasonal flu
strain H3N2 at the Indonesian National Institute of Health Research
and Development. Serology test results were less clear. Antibody
titers from serum samples taken the 6th day provided a weak
indication of H5N1 infection (titer of 1:10) but were negative for
H3N2; convalescent sera, on the other hand, gave a strong indication
of H3N2 infection (titer of 1:640) but were negative for H5N1.

The test results were confirmed by the Eijkman Institute for
Molecular Biology in Jakarta, an arm of the Indonesian Ministry of
Research and Technology, according to the paper. The girl's case fell
within the period when the Indonesian government was not sharing flu
isolates with the international laboratory system maintained by the
World Health Organization, and there was no indication whether her
isolates were evaluated outside the country.

"This is the 1st case-report of a human with both influenza A/H5N1
and H3N2 co-infection," the paper states. "Such infections are of
great concern due to the possibility of genetic reassortment leading
to the emergence of a H5N1 strain that is more easily transmitted
human to human, and emphasizes the importance of advanced
laboratory-based surveillance in geographic regions where both human
and avian influenza viruses are co-circulating."

[The reassuring outcome of these observations is that co-infection of
a human patient by seasonal and avian strains of influenza A virus is
not sufficient to yield recombinants or genome reassortants that
might evolve into a pandemic strain of influenza A virus. However the
relevance of these data is doubtful. The RT-PCR assays indicated that
the patient was co-infected by an H3N2 human influenza virus and H5N1
avian influenza virus. However, the patient displayed only mild signs
and symptoms of infection, which together with the negative H5N1
convalescent serum titre suggest that the avian virus did not
multiply extensively (or at all) in the human host. Few people have
developed severe H5N1 virus infections despite the very large number
of people exposed to infection, suggesting a significant genetic
component in susceptibility. Until co-infection occurs in such a
genetically susceptible individual, the level of risk associated with
co-infection will remain undefined. - Mod.CP]

[The risk of unintentional cross-contamination in RT-PCR tests is
high. It would be desirable to have confirmation of these results
from an international reference lab. - Mod.JW]

Viet Nam: Avian influenza situation - WHO Update 5
---------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has confirmed a new case of human
infection of H5N1 avian influenza. The case has been confirmed by the
National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE). The patient is
an 11-year-old male from Thanh Liem district, Ha Nam province. He
developed symptoms on 4 Mar 2008 was hospitalized on 9 Mar 2008 and
died on 14 Mar 2008. The patient had contact with sick and dead
poultry prior to his illness.

Control measures have been implemented and close contacts have been
identified. All remain healthy and will continue to be monitored.

Of the 106 cases confirmed to date in Viet Nam, 52 have been fatal.
