[The detection of a bluetongue virus in Qatar should not surprise.
BTV-4 has been isolated recently, namely in 2009, from the blood of
susceptible animals in another Gulf state, namely Oman. The samples
were collected on 24 May 2009 from fallow deer and gazelles in
northern Oman, at a latitude similar to the currently affected sites
in Qatar where, likely, similar culicoides vectors are present. See
posting 20090620.2268 and the page "Isolates of Bluetongue virus type
4 (BTV-4) in the dsRNA virus collection at IAH Pirbright," available
on Pirbright's website:
<http://www.reoviridae.org/dsrna_virus_proteins//ReoID/btv-4.htm>.
Subscribers are advised to visit and utilise the unique, exhaustive,
updated information provided in the various pages of the said
web-site. Qatar will now become the 57th country from which BTV
isolates are presented in another of the said web-site's tables,
namely "IAH dsRNA Virus Collection Numbers arranged by country of
origin." - Mod.AS]
