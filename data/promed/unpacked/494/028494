Influenza update 244, based on data up to 9 Aug 2015
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------------
Globally, influenza activity continued in the Southern hemisphere, with an increase in Oceania peaking in temperate South America and decreased activity in South Africa.

In the Northern hemisphere countries, respiratory virus activity remained low in general, and influenza activity continued at low, inter-seasonal levels. Influenza type A predominated in sporadic detections. A number of countries have also ceased or reduced surveillance activity during the inter-seasonal period.

In Eastern Africa, influenza activity remained at low levels. In countries with reported influenza activity, type A predominated. In Western Africa, influenza activity decreased overall, with influenza B predominating in Ghana, and influenza A in Cote d'Ivoire. In tropical countries of the Americas, Central America and the Caribbean, influenza activity remained at low levels, with the exception of Cuba, where high levels of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) were reported, associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and RSV detections.

In tropical Asia, countries in Southern Asia and South East Asia reported an overall decrease in influenza activity. Influenza activity was still high but decreasing in southern China with influenza A(H3N2) predominating.

In temperate South America, ILI and SARI activity was peaking or had peaked mainly due to RSV activity. Overall, influenza activity this season was mild with respect to previous seasons. Influenza type A predominated, with type A(H1N1)pdm09 and type A(H3N2) co-circulating.

In South Africa, influenza activity decreased, with influenza type B predominating in recent weeks.

In Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity seemed to be still increasing with predominantly influenza B followed by influenza A(H3N2) detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 69 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 27 July 2015 to 09 August 2015 (data as of 2015-08-20 12:37:37 UTC).The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 31403 specimens during that time period. 2850 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 2439 (85.6 percent) were typed as influenza A and 411 (14.4 percent) as influenza B. Of the subtyped influenza A viruses, 47 (1.9 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 2398 (98.1 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 118 (94.4 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 7 (5.6 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Influenza activity remained at low, inter-seasonal levels in the countries of the northern hemisphere. A lot of countries have reduced or ceased reporting during this inter-seasonal period.

Countries in the tropical zone
---------------------------------------
Tropical countries of Central America, the Caribbean and South America
The Caribbean, Central America and Andean Sub-region reported low or decreasing influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity during the period of this report, with the exception of Cuba, which reported continued high levels of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), due to influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09 activity and RSV.

African tropical region
Eastern African countries reported decreasing levels of influenza activity, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses co-circulating. Western African countries also reported decreasing levels of influenza activity, with influenza B (Yamagata lineage) viruses predominating, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in co-circulation.

Tropical Asia
Southern Asia reported overall low or decreasing levels of influenza activity during this reporting period, with the exception of Southern China.

India and the Islamic Republic of Iran reported predominantly influenza type B (Victoria Lineage) in recent weeks, while A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses co-circulated in Bhutan. Sri Lanka reported a predominance of influenza A viruses. In Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China, influenza activity decreased to baseline levels overall, but a proportional increase of influenza B virus was detected during this reporting period.

Southern China continued to report elevated circulating levels of influenza A(H3N2) with low levels of influenza type B co-circulation.

South East Asia reported overall low or decreasing influenza activity in recent weeks, although Viet Nam reported an increase in influenza positivity rate with, mainly influenza A(H3N2) detected.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Temperate South America
In temperate South America, ILI and SARI activity was peaking or had peaked mainly due to RSV activity. Overall, influenza activity so far this season has been mild with respect to previous seasons.

Influenza type A predominated, with A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) co-circulating.

Argentina reported decreasing number of ILI and SARI cases, and low number of influenza and RSV detections, but with increasing influenza positivity rates.

In Brazil the respiratory virus detections including influenza and RSV decreased further.

In Chile influenza activity continued to increase, while RSV detections seemed to be at the peak. With Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominating. Though SARI and ICU admissions were also on the rise, this was all within expected levels, and mild in comparison to previous seasons.

In Paraguay, influenza levels continued to decrease, although still at a high level, while influenza detection also further decreased. Influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were co-dominant.

Uruguay continued to report low influenza activity, low RSV detections, and decreasing SARI.

Southern Africa
South Africa continued to report decreased influenza activity in recent weeks. Influenza B (Victoria lineage) viruses predominated this reporting period.

Oceania, Melanesia and Polynesia
Australia reported a continuous increase of influenza activity with varying activity across the country during this reporting period. Influenza type B (Yamagata lineage) viruses predominated with cocirculation of mainly influenza A(H3N2).

In New Zealand, influenza activity continued to increase in recent weeks with influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses predominating. ILI activity remained above the average epidemic curve and SARI case reports continued to increase as well.

Both French Polynesia and the Pacific Islands reported decreased ILI activity in recent weeks.

Source of data
--------------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System) FluID (epidemiological data reported by national focal points) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.
