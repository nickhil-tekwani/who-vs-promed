Summary from the University of California Institute for Desert
Agriculture's report, "Likelihood of Karnal Bunt Spread from
Wheat Harvested in the Imperial and Palo Alto Valleys of
California". A complete copy of the report can be obtained free

Karnal bunt (KB) is a minor disease of wheat that until March 8,
1996, was of little concern to the U.S. grain industry. On that
date, KB was detected in wheat seed that had been planted in
several southwestern states. Based on information gathered by
federal and state agencies, and the possibility of KB spreading
to other wheat growing areas, a quarantine was placed on the
entire state of Arizona, four counties in New Mexico, two
counties in Texas, and Imperial County and part of Riverside
County in California. Research conducted by the University of
California Institute for Desert Agriculture was used to address
the KB situation in California; these studies are reported
herein.
The amount of disease occurring in an area is dependent upon the
presence of the pathogen in sufficient abundance, susceptible
hosts, and favorable climatic conditions. While all three
factors were at a minimum in the Imperial Valley, they combined
to cause a Karnal bunt (KB) outbreak in the Palo Verde Valley. In
the Imperial Valley, 14 fields (0.89%) were planted with seed
lots contaminated with KB teliospores. In contrast, while exact
figures are unknown, we estimate at least 23% of the Palo Verde
Valley wheat acreage was planted with seed lots that had KB
teliospores. The abundance of highly susceptible wheat types
also varied between the two valleys. In the Imperial Valley,
0.93% of the acreage was planted with hard red winter wheat,
while 46% of the acreage in the Palo Verde Valley was planted
with this type. Hard red winter wheat is more susceptible to KB
than durum wheat. Finally, the "cool, moist" climatic conditions
associated with KB were rare in the Imperial Valley during the
periods in which wheat would have been susceptible to infection.
In the Palo Verde Valley, temperatures and humidities were rarely
in the range associated with KB outbreaks (a result similar to
the Imperial Valley), but a higher incidence of rainfall probably
contributed to the development of the disease.
These agronomic and climatic differences correlate with the finds
of KB teliospores in harvested grain. In the Imperial Valley,
1220 fields (81% of the total) have been sampled and all have
tested negative. Of the 254 fields that have been tested in the
Palo Verde Valley, 59 (23%) have tested positive. Thus, while
the desert climate rarely is optimal for KB outbreaks, conditions
for sporulation and infection can occur. Our data suggest that
planting clean seed of durum varieties will minimize the
establishment of KB in the desert areas in the future.
The 1996 conditions present in the Imperial and Palo Verde
Valleys were used to develop four site-specific probabilistic
risk assessments for outbreaks caused by contaminated seed grown
in the valleys. These assessments build on the work of Podleckis
and Firko (1996 a,b) and use input probabilities based on data
which are unique to each region. Determining the likelihood of
having a KB outbreak outside the quarantine area, the risk
assessment for the Imperial Valley showed that there is a 1
chance in 5.86 million for this event happening if the millfeed
is treated. If the millfeed is not treated, there is a 1 chance
in 1.05 million. For the Palo Verde Valley, the odds of a KB
outbreak from grain transported out of the valley is 1 chance in
5.08 million if the millfeed is treated, and 1 chance in 915,358
if the millfeed is not treated. These odds relate specifically
to the situations described in the analyses, which are unique to
each of the valleys.
A key assumption of the risk assessments is that grain which
tests positive for KB teliospores is not transported to mills
outside the quarantine area. This assumption pertains regardless
if the positive KB wheat is grown in a field planted with
contaminated seed, is positive in the pre-harvest test, or is
found in a rail car. With this criterion established, the
California Department of Food and Agriculture and USDA sampling
protocols are crucial to solving the current KB crisis in
California. Therefore, as long as the wheat is tested, and the
grain from fields, silos, and rail cars that test negative is not
mixed with KB and grain, there is a very low probability of a KB
outbreak outside the quarantined area.
To complete our understanding of the KB situation in these desert
valleys, we determined the economic impact of the quarantine to
wheat growers in the Imperial and Palo Verde Valleys. Wheat
farmers currently are enjoying the best market conditions in over
20 years. Integrating futures prices, cash prices, average
contract prices, average yield, and growing costs, growers in
these quarantined valley not only fail to realize profits ranging
from $47 - $162 per acre (desert-wide cash value of $77,633,628),
they also experience a loss of $471 per acre (desert-wide revenue
losses of $57,754,962) which already has been spent to grow and
harvest the grain.
In the process of our scientific investigation, data gaps
regarding the movement, establishment, growth and management of
KB became apparent. As a final section of this document, we
identify these data gaps and offer ideas for future research. If
these research topics are explored, we believe they will provide
results that can be used to determine the best course of action
for dealing with KB in the U.S.
