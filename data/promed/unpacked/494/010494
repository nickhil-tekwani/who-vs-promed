Fungal disease threatens Swedish wheat harvest
----------------------------------------------
The wheat harvest in many parts of Sweden is under threat by the
fungus disease _Tilletia contraversa_ (dwarf bunt). The Board of
Agriculture (Jordbruksverket) has found several [cases] of the
disease in Sodermanland and now fears a wider distribution in central
Sweden. "For growers, this is a big setback, because the harvest may
be unmarketable," said Alf Djurberg, Board of Agriculture.

Dwarf bunt is not in itself dangerous, but the spores from the fungus
smell awful and render the wheat useless as food. The last time
central Sweden was hit by dwarf bunt was in 1994 when there was also
an outbreak of common bunt, something that the board cannot preclude
could also exist this year [2010].

It is not yet known how large the outbreak is, but since the spores
spread easily at harvest the board has now advised farmers to do an
extra inspection of their crops.

In addition to disease, this 2009/2010 season's crops have been hit
hard by the long and snowy winter. The drought in July [2010] has
also impacted yields from crops sown in the spring.

[Dwarf bunt (or dwarf smut) of small grain cereals is caused by
_Tilletia contraversa_. It can infect wheat, rye, barley, triticale,
and a range of other grassy hosts. Symptoms may include severe
stunting and excessive tillering of plants, which also take on a
blueish tinge. Kernels are replaced by rounded bunt balls containing
masses of dark spores which tend to spread glumes apart and are
crushed during harvest. Economic losses are due to reduced yields as
well as an offensive odour emitted by spores, which makes harvested
grain unfit for human consumption. Severely infected crops may have
infection levels as high as 50 percent. Dwarf bunt mainly occurs in
regions that have prolonged snow cover and causes damage mostly on
winter wheat. Spores germinate under snow on unfrozen ground, but
conditions are not favourable every winter and the disease tends to
appear intermittently.

Common bunt, which is also mentioned above, is caused by the closely
related _T. caries_ or _T. laevis_. Symptoms are similar, except
plants are much less severely stunted. Spore balls are more elongated
and more similar in appearance to normal grains. Common bunt affects
both winter and spring wheat.

For both dwarf and common bunt, spores can lie dormant in the soil or
on seed for many years until they infect emerging seedlings. Spores
can be spread by wind, mechanical means and with contaminated plant
and other materials. They are highly allergenic to humans but
non-toxic to livestock. Disease management may include phytosanitary
measures to prevent spread, use of certified clean seed, and
fungicide applications as seed treatments and/or preventative foliar
sprays. Commercial wheat cultivars have varying levels of
susceptibility to dwarf and common bunts.

In warmer climates, _T. indica_ causes Karnal bunt of wheat and _T.
barclayana_ black smut of rice.
