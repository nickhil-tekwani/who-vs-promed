Background on Cryptosporidia in Sweden
--------------------------------------
Prior to a recent outbreak in Jamtland,
Cryptosporidium had been the least common
reported cause of diarrhea in Sweden -- see graph:
<http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Cryptosporid-Sweden.jpg>

The following background data are abstracted from
the Gideon e-book series.1,2 (primary references available on request).

Prevalence surveys:
2 percent of adult patients with diarrhea (2000 publication)
24 percent of untreated surface water supplies in 1996; 40 percent in 1997
52 percent of calves, 29 percent of young stock
and 5.6 percent of cows in dairy herds (2005 to 2007)

One waterborne outbreak was reported during 1986 to 1996.

Notable outbreaks:
2002 - An outbreak (800 to 1000 cases) was
reported among visitors to a public swimming pool.
2007 - An outbreak was reported at a daycare center in the Stockholm area.
2007 - An outbreak (25 cases) was reported among
Swedish guests at a hotel in Norway.
2008 - An outbreak (21 cases) was reported among
guests at a wedding reception in a hotel in Stockholm.

[ProMED thanks Steve Berger for this background
information. The moderator's comments on the 1st
posting on the subject could be misunderstood,
and it should be made clear that Cryptosporidia
are very resistant to chlorine and are only removed by filtration. - Mod.EP]
