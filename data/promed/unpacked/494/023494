We would kindly like to submit additional comments to the above post [see commentary].

On 11 Jul 2018, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a scientific opinion on African swine fever (ASF) in wild boar [http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/5344]. However, some aspects of the said scientific opinion have been wrongly interpreted in the following 2 segments of the cited "Pig Progress" report.

(1) "A group of eminent researchers on behalf of EFSA also recently identified that intensive hunting of wild boar might provide a solution. EFSA advised that intensive hunting is advisable only in the preventive stage, i.e., in the free area where the disease has not yet been introduced."

[EFSA's comment]: Preventive measures to reduce and stabilise wild boar density, before ASF introduction, will be beneficial both in reducing the probability of exposure of the population to ASF and the efforts needed for potential emergency actions (i.e., less carcass removal) if an ASF incursion were to occur. Following focal ASF introduction, the wild boar populations should be kept undisturbed for a short period (e.g., hunting ban on all species, leave crops unharvested to provide food and shelter within the affected area), and drastic reduction of the wild boar population may be performed only ahead of the ASF advance front in the free populations. Following the decline in the epidemic, as demonstrated through passive surveillance, active population management should be reconsidered. This will reduce the chances of exposure to susceptible pigs and the efforts of emergency measures (e.g., carcass removal).

(2) "In a scientific opinion published in the EFSA Journal [https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/5344; see commentary for the abstract], EFSA experts stated that when wild boar populations are below a certain threshold, the virus simply cannot spread, as the virus is kept away from uninfected boars."

[EFSA's comment]: This is wrongly interpreted: EFSA stated that based on practical and theoretical considerations, it is currently not possible to establish wild boar density thresholds that do not allow sustaining ASF. There are many drivers determining whether ASF can be sustained, including heterogeneous population structures and human‚Äêmediated spread, and there are still unknowns on the importance of different transmission modes in the epidemiology.

Please note that we also have produced an animation to inform the public about ASF and how it can be prevented: African swine fever -- how to stay one step ahead [https://youtu.be/eyQ4t1wHl2M].

[EFSA's corrigendum above addresses a report by Pig Progress (PP) dated 11 Jul 2018, which was included in posting 20180711.5899939; the said PP report's URL is https://www.pigprogress.net/Health/Articles/2018/7/ASF-update-Outbreaks-in-Romania-EU-steps-up-the-fight-308334E/?cmpid=NLC|pigprogress_focus|2018-07-11|.

ProMED's commentary to the above PP report was composed of the original abstract of EFSA's scientific report, which included reference to the wild boar culling policy.
