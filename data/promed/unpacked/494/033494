RVF detected in Asir region
---------------------------
Asir region governorate has banned the transportation including the
entry and exit of livestock to and from Mahayil Governorate
especially in areas and rural centers where positive samples for
antibodies of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus were detected.

The region's governorate issued directives to Mahayil to prevent the
movement of livestock to and from the governorate and to coordinate
with the concerned authorities. It directed the security authorities
to implement these measures and asked the Ministry of Agriculture
branch to pinpoint the locations of afflicted herds and to cooperate
in vaccinating livestock and spraying animal sheds, to report new RVF
cases immediately and to monitor veterinary pharmacies. Earlier, the
region's governorate set up an operations room to monitor any RVF
cases.

In another development, blood samples taken from the expatriate
Azizul Haq Kalamiyah, 40, suspected of suffering from RVF has tested
negative. The reports came in from the regional laboratory in Jeddah,
said Sa'eed Abdullah Al-Neqair, Director of Health Information and
Public Relations in Asir Region Directorate of Health.

Last month [November 2008] when the reports of the virus 1st came to
light, the authorities took immediate preventive measures.

[Posting 20081203.3798 included media-derived information about a
case of a 40-year-old Bangladeshi worker who has been admitted into
the ICU [intensive care unit] in a private hospital in Asir region
with suspected laboratory characteristics of Rift Valley fever (RVF).
The man was initially diagnosed with an unknown type of fever and
elevated liver enzyme levels, both indicators of the RVF.

If the current newswire addresses the same patient, as it seems, then
it now appears that this was a false alarm.

However, as discussed in posting 20081211.3894, RVF may have become
endemic is certain parts of the Kingdom, mass vaccinations are being
applied in livestock, and alertness deserves to be maintained --
particularly during the rainy season. - Mod.AS]
