Bird flu present in seven Russian districts
-------------------------------------------
Bird flu continues to be present in 7 Russian districts out of a total 80
locations where outbreaks have been recorded this year, the agriculture
ministry said. "Currently ... 73 districts previously contaminated by flu
have been cleaned up and 7 zones are still affected," the ministry said on
its internet site.
All the contaminated districts are in the south of the country, in the
provinces of Volgograd, Krasnodar and Dagestan. {Map at

[Russia's most recent notification to the OIE on HPAI in domestic poultry
was sent on 6 Feb 2006. It related to 2 outbreaks on farms in Dagestan
(Karabudachkentsky region); see
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_30.HTM#Sec2>. An update would be useful.
