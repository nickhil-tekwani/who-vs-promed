A park in Oldham was taped off following a suspected 'avian botulism' outbreak. Emergency services were called to Alexandra Park after a number of birds -- said to be ducks -- were found dead in the lake. They are currently testing water samples from the park to confirm the theory that the animals died as a result of avian botulism - a disease that affects wild and captive birds and is often fatal. Outbreaks are common in England and Wales, but are more frequent during warm summers.

Alexandra Park was closed off for several hours, with officials at the scene telling that it would remain shut until warning signs were put up. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, Public Health England, Oldham Council, the ambulance service and the RSPCA were all involved in the operation. Police were also alerted to the incident.

A spokesman for the RSPCA said that 'where possible' sick birds have been taken to local vets. They added: "This is a very distressing situation and it is suspected the birds are suffering from avian botulism, a disease which sadly is quite common in extremely hot weather. Where possible, we have contained and transported sick birds to local vets. We have been working closely with the park authorities who have responsibility for the site and advising them on how to deal with the situation. We will continue to assist as necessary."

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said that 3 crews attended, along with a Tactical Response Unit and Water Incident Unit.They said: "We were called at 5.33 pm to reports that a number of birds had died in the water at the park. We are assisting authorities as they work to establish the cause of the deaths."

A statement from Public Health England said: "Public Health England is aware of reports of dead birds suspected to be from avian botulism at Alexandra Park, Oldham. Avian botulism outbreaks in wild waterbirds occur relatively frequently in ponds and lakes in England and Wales in periods when there is less oxygen in the water, such as during heat waves, because the bacteria which release the botulinum toxin can occur in these conditions. The type of botulinum toxin most commonly associated with avian botulism has not been reported to be associated with human disease and therefore the risk to human health is considered to be very low."

However, as a precautionary measure for any lake or pond where dead birds have been found, we would advise:

- not drinking from the lake;
- avoid swimming or paddling in the lake;
- avoid any watersports on the lake;
- preventing pets from entering the water;
- not eating any fish from the lake.

Avian botulism does not present a risk to human health; however people should seek further advice if they have been into the water or ingested it.

According to the Animal and Plant Health Agency, birds that contract the disease are unable to use their legs or wings and they can't fly. [Avian botulism] can also paralyse a bird's neck muscles stopping it from holding its head. They say the creatures can remain in this state for a number of days and death is often due to respiratory failure and/or drowning.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. - Mod.PMB
