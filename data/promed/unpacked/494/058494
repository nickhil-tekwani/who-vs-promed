Barely 12 hours after the deaths of 3 members of a family near Perambra in Kozhikode district of Kerala were confirmed as a result of Nipah virus infection, 8 more people died after showing similar symptoms in Kozhikode and Malappuram, sparking panic among locals in the region.

"We got the report from the National Institute of Virology, Pune, on Sunday night [20 May 2018], confirming Nipah virus infection in the blood samples of the 3 persons who had died initially. Now, 4 more persons who were allegedly in contact with the deceased have died at the Medical College," Kozhikode district medical officer Jayashree V confirmed.

One of the persons who died late Sunday [20 May 2018] was identified as a nurse who worked at the taluk hospital, reportedly in close contact with those who were infected. To prevent further spread of the infection, her body was cremated immediately without handing it over to her family.

"Through secretions, the virus could spread from one person to another. It is a serious situation but there's no need to panic. All those persons who were reportedly in contact with the infected are being closely monitored. We have asked the medical personnel to use all safety gear such as gloves and masks while dealing with potentially infected persons. The collector has already ordered the area around the home of the family with the initial deaths to be cordoned off," Jayashree said, stressing that all practices to control the spread of the infection have been put in place.

Neighbours reportedly told medical officials that they saw the 3 members of the family -- brothers and their paternal aunt -- consuming what looked like fruits picked up from a compound in which they are building a home.

While 7 deaths have been reported from Kozhikode, 4 people who showed similar symptoms of viral encephalitis have died in Malappuram, the district's medical officer Sakeena KJ told indianexpress.com. "We cannot confirm at this point that the deaths of 4 persons here are due to Nipah virus. But they showed similar symptoms of viral fever and encephalitis, so it could be suspected. We are taking all precautions," she said. The deaths have been reported from Thennala, Mungiyur, and Chettiparambu panchayats.

Health Minister KK Shylaja will oversee the efforts of the health department in Kozhikode and Malappuram where the spread of the infection has alarmed the locals. The department has asked people not to believe rumours generated on social media platforms like WhatsApp.

A medical camp was conducted in Changaroth panchayat on Sunday [20 May 2018], where the initial deaths occurred, to assist people who may be developing symptoms of viral fever. The camp is likely to continue today [21 May 2018] as well. A control room has also been set up to disseminate information about the virus.

The staff nurse who was taking care of the patients who died of viral fever in Perambra also died due to viral infection. The latest victim is the nurse at Perambra taluk office and native of Peruvannamoozhi in Chembannod ([age](31).

The nurse took care of the brothers from Changarothu who died at the Perambra taluk office following viral fever. The dead body of the nurse, who died at the Kozhikode Medical College on Monday morning [21 May 2018], was cremated in an electric crematorium without being handed over to her relatives top prevent the spread of the viral infection.

With this, the death toll due to viral infection has risen to 9. The death toll due to viral fever including Nipah virus in Malappuram and Kozhikode has risen to 16. About 15 people died in Kozhikode district within the past 2 weeks due to fever. [The victims are:] a woman (50), wife of a man from Kaarimattam in Kozhikode; a man (50) from Naduvannur, a (36-year-old) from Thrurangadi, a youth (14) from Ponmala, and (48-year-old) from Kolathur; these are the people who died at the Medical College Hospital.

[These reports increase the fatality case count and indicate that the etiological agent responsible for these cases is now confirmed as Nipah virus. Nipah virus infections have occurred sporadically in India in the past. They were confirmed as the cause of 5 previously undiagnosed cases of illness in the Nadia district of West Bengal.

The source of the current outbreak and the involvement of bats, pigs, and domestic cats and dogs have still to be established, although fruit contaminated by bats is mentioned above as a possible source of the virus. Giant fruit bats (genus _Pteropus_) are reservoirs of Nipah virus in Bangladesh and Malaysia, and are likely to be in India as well. There is no vaccine available for Nipah virus, so public information about avoidance of contaminated fruit is prudent. - Mod.TY
