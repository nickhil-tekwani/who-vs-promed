[The addition of these 8 new cases and 1 new death raises the total number of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals in Saudi Arabia to 562, including 179 deaths. Of note in yesterday's (24 May 2014) and today's (25 May 2014) updates is the occurrence of 4 additional cases in Gonfodah -- 3 asymptomatic contacts and one individual in "stable condition" with a history of comorbidities. The 1st MERS-CoV report of an infected individual in Gonfodah was reported in the Saudi MOH MERS update on 22 May 2014 -- a 65 year old male who had visited a government hospital on 18 May 2014 for health reasons was reported as having been in contact with a confirmed case and was in home isolation (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (67): Saudi Arabia, UAE, USA, WHO 20140524.2491495). It now appears as though the 45 year old female reported today (25 May 2014), had an earlier date of onset of symptoms on 17 May 2014. Checking on the administrative divisions in Saudi Arabia, looking for information on "Gonfodah", an alternative name for the city is Al Qunfudhah, and it is located on the Red Sea coast. It is the 4th largest city population-wise in Makkah Province, with an estimated 185 000 people. It is located on the southwestern border of Makkah province, south of Al Lith, bordered by the Al Aradhiyah city. It is located 290 km (180 mi) to the south of Mecca, and 340 km (211 mi) from Jeddah (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Qunfidhah). The obvious question remains as to the location of the government hospital visited by the 65 year old male on 18 May 2014, where he presumably had contact with a previously confirmed case, and similarly where was the contact with a previously confirmed case for the 2 asymptomatic cases in Gonfodah/Al Qunfidhah reported in today's (25 May 2014) MOH update? Did the 45 year old female seek medical care on 17 or 18 May 2014 at the same locations as the earlier reported cases?

New case of coronavirus in Jordan
---------------------------------
A 60 year old Jordanian citizen has [been infected by] the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV], raising the cases of the illness in Jordan to 10, the Jordanian Ministry of Health announced today [24 May 2014].

Director of Health Care at the Jordanian Ministry of Health Dr Bashir Al-Qaseer said in press release today [24 May 2014] that laboratory tests confirmed that the citizen was suffering from the coronavirus and was admitted to the Jordanian University Hospital.

The patient was quarantined in the isolation and intensive care section to be proved with the necessary medical care.

Dr Al-Qaseer added that the incubation period of the coronavirus in human body after contracting the virus ranges between 2 to 14 days, stressing that the number of proven cases in Jordan until yesterday [23 May 2014] reached 10 cases, including 5 deaths.

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory illness. It is caused by a coronavirus called MERS-CoV. Most people who have been confirmed to have MERS-CoV infection developed severe acute respiratory illness. They had fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

According to the Jordanian MOH official cited in the media report above, this newly reported case represents the 10th case of MERS-CoV infection reported by Jordan. This tally does not include the 7 individuals related to the 1st documented outbreak of MERS-CoV in Jordan in April 2012 found to have serologic evidence of prior MERS-CoV infection (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (60): Middle East, Netherlands, USA, WHO 20140515.2474996).

Information from the epidemiologic investigation of this current case, including age, gender, geographic location within Jordan, and possible risk exposures (contact with previously confirmed MERS-CoV infected individual, travel history, contact with animals or raw animal products, contact with health sector during the incubation period, would be greatly appreciated.

For a map of Jordan, see < https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2496138,91>.

It is curious that in recent days there have been reports of MERS-CoV infection in countries outside of Saudi Arabia -- both UAE and Jordan are reporting cases. One wonders if there is now more awareness on the part of the health sector to test for MERS-CoV, leading to increased diagnosis, vs increase in actual incidence of the disease elsewhere. - Mod.MPP
