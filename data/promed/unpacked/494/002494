Agriculture and Rural Development Minister Cao Duc Phat urged authorities in bird flu-hit provinces to take steps to curb the disease.

Bird flu outbreaks were detected in the central province of Quang Ngai and the highland province of Kon Tum, said the Department of Animal Health under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development yesterday [12 Jan 2016].

In Quang Ngai Province, the center of Animal Health in Son Tinh District confirmed that a flock of poultry in a farm in Tra Binh village was positive with bird flu virus A(H5N6). In Kon Tum Province, local animal health agency reported 824 water fowls of a farm in Dak Kan commune in Ngoc Hoi District were infected with the disease and 600 of them died later. Test results showed that they are positive with the virus.

Accordingly, Mr. Phat ordered local authorities to check animal breeding and provide breeding animals and animal feed for breeders to encourage them to continue raising animals to prevent a price soar. Local authorities must also implement ways to handle the spread of the disease.
