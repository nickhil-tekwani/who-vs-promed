[The rabies situation in Belarus seems to be stable; mapped details
on the annual (including 2006) number and distribution of cases in
each animal species and in humans are available in the (commended)
web-site of the Rabies Information System of the WHO Collaboration
Centre for Rabies Surveillance and Research (Europe); see:
<http://rbe1.fli.bund.de/Queries/Maps.aspx>.
It would help to note if the application of oral vaccination in fauna
is being considered in Belarus.
