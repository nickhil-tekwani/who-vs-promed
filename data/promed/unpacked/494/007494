Wusheng county of Guangan city [Sichuan province] reported 2 human H7N9 AIV [influenza A(H7N9)] cases (one fatal) on [20 Feb 2017] after the confirmation from Sichuan provincial CDC. The epidemiological investigation revealed both patients had a history of exposure to live poultry, but no epidemiological connection with each other. The environmental surveillance conducted by Guangan city CDC showed a chicken anal swab sample tested positive for H7 AIV, proving H7 AIV existed in the local environment (market). The 92 close contacts of the patients are under medical monitoring, no ILI [influenza-like illness] symptoms has been reported so far.

Sichuan province has reported 8 cases of human H7N9 AIV so far, 5 cases in Suining city (one fatal), one case in Deyang city, and 2 cases in Guangan (one fatal)

[3] Taiwan (Taipei): WHO

On 4 Feb 2017, Taipei Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported one laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. This is the 5th human case with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus reported from Taipei CDC.

Details of the case
-------------------
The patient, a 69-year-old male travelled to Yangjiang City, Guangdong Province, China from [18 Sep 2016 to 25 Jan 2017]. He developed fever and chills on [23 Jan 2017] while in Guangdong. On [25 Jan 2017], the patient returned to Taiwan, China and visited the emergency room. During the medical consultation, neither fever nor pneumonia was detected and a rapid test for influenza on an oropharyngeal sample was negative. PCR testing of additional samples was obtained the next day and tested negative for avian influenza A viruses.

On [1 Feb 2017], he visited the emergency room again due to fever, productive cough and dyspnoea. Bilateral pneumonia was diagnosed and he was then intubated due to respiratory failure. On [2 Feb 2017], additional sputum samples were collected and were positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.

Contact tracing following the detection of this case revealed that 2 of 6 of his colleagues in mainland China had upper respiratory symptoms which resolved after treatment. 2 family members of the case have been asymptomatic at the time of reporting.

No source of exposure to the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus has been identified thus far for this patient. He denied any exposure to live birds or live poultry markets during his stay in Guangdong province. The patient also denied exposure to others with suspicious illnesses. He remained at home or in the hospital after returning to Taiwan, China.

To date, a total of 1223 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.

This total number of cases includes 5 cases reported from Taipei CDC, 20 cases reported from Hong Kong CHP, 1 case reported from Macau SAR, 2 cases reported from Canada, and 1 case reported from Malaysia.

Public health response
----------------------
Response measures have been taken by Taipei CDC such as:
- carrying out epidemiological investigations, close contact tracing, management and medical observations;
- strengthening surveillance of pneumonia with unknown causes, routine influenza sentinel surveillance, as well as flu and avian flu virology surveillance;
- the travel history of the case has been sent to the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China for further investigation.

The agriculture department in Taiwan, China has been conducting wild bird and poultry surveillance for avian influenza routinely since 1997. Avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses were detected in wild birds in 2015, but based on phylogenetic analysis, these viruses differed from the avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses currently infecting poultry in mainland China with spillover infections in humans exposed to these infected birds.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
While similar sudden increases in the number of human avian influenza A(H7N9) cases identified have been reported in previous years the number of cases reported during this season is exceeding previous seasons. The number of human cases with onset from [1 Oct 2016] accounts for nearly 1/3 of all the human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection reported since 2013.

However, human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus remain unusual. Close observation of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent human viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures timely.

Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases may be also expected in previously unaffected provinces as it is likely that this virus circulates in poultry of other areas of China without being detected.

Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.

Although small clusters of human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.

WHO advice
----------
WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.

[4] Genetic mutations

http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2072454/mutation-h7n9-bird-flu-strain-found-guangdong-patients


China has reported the 1st genetic mutation of the H7N9 bird flu virus with specialists predicting the change will result in more dead poultry. The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention informed the World Health Organisation that the mutation was found in samples collected from 2 patients in Guangdong province last month [January 2017].

The mutation suggested the virus had become deadlier to poultry but there was no indication it posed a greater risk to people, or made transmission among humans more likely, the centre said in a statement released on [Sun 19 Feb 2017].

It came to the conclusion after consulting experts with the agricultural ministry. Both patients had been exposed to dead poultry. One had been discharged while the other was still receiving treatment.

The centre said 105 people who were in close contact with the patients were being monitored, but none had developed symptoms of bird flu. Agricultural authorities had also found four poultry samples that might contain the mutation but further study was necessary. The poultry samples were also collected in Guangdong.

Shi Yi, viral infection researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Microbiology, said mutations in bird flu were not uncommon, and the H5N1 virus had undergone a similar change. "There is no laboratory experiment yet, but based on previous studies on H5N1, it's possible for the mutated H7N9 to become more [likely to cause disease]," Shi said.

"But there is no proof to suggest any viral changes in existing infection channels or strength." Chinese cities shut markets selling live poultry as bird flu deaths surge to 100 this season.

Guan Yi, director of the University of Hong Kong's State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases and the Centre of Influenza Research, said a H7N9 mutation would kill poultry more readily. "Before the mutation, the H7N9 virus would only infect poultry intestines and the respiratory tract, but the mutation means the virus can travel to any organ of the chicken," Guan said.

Such a mutation would kill the chicken "in a few days". While there was no indication the mutation would have a greater direct impact on humans, it could lead to more infections in people, given the higher risk of infection among poultry. More than 100 people have died from bird flu this winter and many provinces have suspended the live poultry trade.

[5] Risk of H7N9 spread
Date: Wed 22 Feb 2017 8:01 AM CST

http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2070259/beijing-joins-list-mainland-cities-reporting-bird-flu


Chinese health authorities have issued stern warnings over the H7N9 bird flu outbreak in the last 2 days, admitting the situation had already affected half of the country and could lead to even more fatalities.

Since January [2017], human deaths and infections from H7N9 have been reported in 16 provinces and municipalities, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission.

While the situation was still "preventable and controllable", the commission warned in a statement on [Tue 21 Feb 2017] that if the situation was not tightly controlled the virus could spread further. The virus had killed at least 87 people by [12 Feb 2017], including 79 in January [2017].

It is the highest death toll since the 1st known human infection in 2013, and most of the cases have been in the Pearl and Yangtze River delta areas. In the previous 3 years, January's death toll had ranged between 20 and 31.

The commission's statement came one day after it warned provincial health authorities across the country, including Xinjiang and Tibet, of the risks of the latest H7N9 outbreak.

Local authorities were ordered to make "utmost effort" to contain the disease and minimise deaths.

The World Health Organisation said there were no signs of sustained human-to-human transmission in bird flu cases this year, but it would remain "vigilant" over the puzzling outbreak in which affected poultry did not show any symptoms.

The strength of the outbreak has spurred authorities in central and southern China to close poultry markets. Earlier this month, Zhejiang shut down its live poultry markets. Some cities in Jiangsu have banned live poultry trade as well.

In addition, Guangdong province has suspended the sale of poultry from high-risk areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, and ordered each city to restrict the live poultry trade.

In Guangzhou, where H7N9 was detected at 30 per cent of live poultry markets, sales have been suspended since [16 Feb 2017], with the ban remaining in place until the end of the month [February 2017]. The order appears to have been enforced to an unprecedented extent in the city, where residents have a strong preference for buying live chickens over frozen ones.

"It is really strict this year [2017]. Vendors secretly sold live chickens when there was a similar ban before, but not this time," one vegetable vendor at a wet market in Guangzhou's downtown Yuexiu district said.

A Guangzhou resident said fear of catching the virus stopped her from going to a wet market unless absolutely necessary. "I've caught a cold and I have elderly people at home. I don't want to catch something in the market," she said.

The commission said contact with H7N9-infected poultry or exposure at a market with live poultry were high risk factors and shutting down such markets had proved effective.
