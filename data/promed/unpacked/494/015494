[The summer has brought the usual rash of food poisonings in China. We are
following web-based reports of foodborne illness in China and reported in
Chinese. 3 of these 5 reports are related to spread in the school
environment. This is a seasonal phenomenon that has no particular
implications for spread to visitors or the general populace. - Mod.LL/JW]
