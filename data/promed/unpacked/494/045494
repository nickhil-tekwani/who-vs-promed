Huge Feed Recall Due To Mammalian Protein
---------------------------------------------
The Food and Drug Administration announced 2 recalls, one for 27 million
pounds of feed produced in Michigan and the other an unknown amount of feed
produced in Kentucky. Both were suspected of being adulterated with ruminant
or mammalian protein, including ruminant meat and bone meal in the 2nd
recall.
Vita Plus Corp., Gagetown, Michigan, has recalled 27 694 240 pounds of dairy
feed produced between February of 2005 and 16 Jun 2006, because it is
believed it was contaminated with mammalian protein. The feed was
distributed in Michigan and the recall is complete.
Burkmann Feeds LLC, Glasgow, Kentucky, has recalled an unknown amount of custom
feed because it contains an ingredient called Pro-Lak, which may contain
ruminant-derived meat and bone meal. The Burkmann feed was distributed in
Kentucky.

[A codified rule indicates that no mammalian material is to be
included in feed for ruminants. When it is found that such a
situation has occurred, then a recall is issued. Several years ago, a
similar situation happened in Gonzales, Texas, and the herd was
depopulated. The difference must be that the regulatory authorities
do not know where all the herds are that have consumed the feed. - Mod.TG]
