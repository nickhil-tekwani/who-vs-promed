Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Death Rate in Uganda
--------------------------------------------
[As reported in ProMED-mail's posting Ebola hemorrhagic fever - Uganda (40)
20001201.2094, I am rather intrigued by the fact that "In areas of Sudan
and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Ebola hemorrhagic fever [had
occurred previously, mortality rates ranged between 80-90 percent, while
in Uganda the mortality rates remained around 30 percent." If that is
indeed the case why does the mortality rate for the nursing staff at Lacor
hospital seem so high? We are told in media sources that "Since the onset
of the epidemic on 13 Oct 2000, a total of 10 Lacor nurses have died from
the virulent fever." (<http://allafrica.com/stories/200012020085.html>)
The latest health worker casualty is the Superintendant of Lacor Hospital,
who contracted the disease while tending to a sick nurse. Is it possible to
obtain data for that sub-set of people who were infected? The BBC for
instance reports that "12 nurses at Lacor Hospital in Gulu District --
which has been at the centre of the Ebola outbreak -- have so far
contracted the disease and died."
(<http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_1054000/1054557.stm>).
Can this be interpreted as anything but a 100% mortality rate? I know media
reports are often flimsy, but this one should be followed up by ProMED-mail
through WHO and Ugandan Ministry channels.

[Pierre Bigras has posed interesting questions. There have indeed been
inconsistencies in some media reports. A reader in Wuerzburg has pointed
out that the first report cited by Pierre Bigras also contained the
statement that a "WHO Country Representative for Uganda told the UN
Integrated Regional Information Network that to date the epidemic has
claimed 149 lives out of 357 reported cases," which equates to a
case/fatality ratio of 41.7% and conflicts with the figure of approximately
30% quoted later in the same report. Likewise, Sidney Gilpatrick in Houston
pointed out an inconsistency between 2 statements by a Ugandan official in
the same report that "In Masindi district...the cumulative total (in the
area) is 14 cases with 5 deaths" and that "12 Ebola sufferers remain in
Masindi District Hospital." The reason for some of these discrepancies may
relate to the difference between laboratory-confirmed and unconfirmed
counts. The central authorities in Uganda recently decided to publish only
figures of laboratory-confirmed cases; these inevitably will be lower than
numbers of cases assessed on clinical signs and symptoms which may be used
locally. It is also possible that the news agency reports were compiled
from statements made by officials at different times and that the figures
were accurate at the time and in the context they were given.
The WHO Disease Outbreak Report - Update 32, released on 30 Nov 2000,
reported the figures for confirmed cases and deaths as 354 and 140, giving
a case/fatality ratio of 39.8%, which is higher than the 32-33% reported
throughout most of November. - Mod.CP
