Mystery disease toll in Uttar Pradesh rises to 98
-----------------------------------------------
6 more lives were claimed by the mystery disease stalking western Uttar
Pradesh, taking the death toll to 98 today [30 Oct 2004]. The
worst-affected district of Sahranpur, where the disease is afflicting
children, had 50 deaths, including 6 since last evening [29 Oct 2004]. All
of the 6 deaths took place in Nangal town of the Sahranpur district. 2 of
them died in the hospital, official sources said in Ghaziabad.
District Magistrate Bhagpat Kamini Ratan Chauhan said that the number of
ailing children was on the rise, even though there were no new deaths. The
disease has so far claimed 14 lives in Bhagpat.
According to doctors, all cases appeared to be of viral encephalitis, as
the brains of the children had been affected.

Child deaths: NIV scientists in UP
-----------------------------------
Reports of a mysterious disease stalking children in several districts of
western Uttar Pradesh has activated the city-based National Institute of
Virology (NIV) to dispatch a team of scientists to collect samples and work
towards a proper diagnosis of the virus.
A team of 3 senior scientists are already in Uttar Pradesh, while another
team left on Monday [25 Oct 2004], Dr. G Varghese, NIV's officiating
officer-in-charge, told Pune Newsline.
So far, at least 48 children have succumbed to the mysterious disease
traced to Sahranpur, Noida, Ghaziabad, and Bulandshahr. This was after
about 100 children were admitted to several health government care centers
and hospitals at Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, and Garhmukteshwar districts with
complaints of severe headache, fever, and vomiting. But, the children found
to be infected with the deadly virus displayed symptoms similar to
meningitis and cholera.
NIV scientists are supposed to collect samples and come back to Pune for
investigation. Serology and other tests will be conducted, and the findings
will be confirmed with a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, Dr. Varghese
said.

Mystery disease knocks on Delhi's door
-------------------------------------
Disturbed by the rise in the death toll in neighboring Uttar Pradesh, the
Delhi government has asked 2 hospitals to remain alert for the "mysterious
disease" identified as Japanese Encephalitis. The disease, that has so far
caused 92 deaths, is a mosquito-borne viral infection. Delhi health
minister, Yoganand Shastri, on Tuesday [26 Oct 2004] directed the health
department to take due precautions against the infection.
2 government hospitals, Kalawati Saran and Guru Tegh Bahadur, have been
alerted, even while authorities confirmed that no such cases have been
reported in Delhi so far.
Health department officials will be meeting with officials from the Union
health ministry and the Indian Council for Medical Research on Wednesday
[27 Oct 2004], asking for guidelines on the issue. "We do not have a very
clear idea about the disease. We will ask the ministry to issue guidelines,
and the directorate of health services will implement them accordingly,"
said S.P. Aggarwal, principal secretary (health).
According to news reports, the death toll in UP's Baghpat and Saharanpur
areas has gone up to 92. Saharanpur district was the worst affected,
accounting for 40 deaths so far. A few deaths were also reported from
Moradabad, Noida, and Ghaziabad districts.

[This is now the 5th posting in this thread of these "undiagnosed deaths"
in Uttar Pradesh, India. In earlier newswires, there were descriptions of
"malaria" and "cholera," but also, of encephalitis. With the encephalitis
description, we did speculate that Japanese encephalitis might be the
etiologic agent responsible for this "undiagnosed" outbreak, not unrelated
to the observations that Uttar Pradesh has annual outbreaks of Japanese
encephalitis. In all prior postings, we have requested more information
from official sources, hoping that one of our subscribers in India, or
among the international public health community, might have some
information based on the actual investigations rather than on the newswires
we have been posting. While Japanese encephalitis is the most likely
etiology, one should not forget that henipavirus has been responsible for
unusual encephalitis outbreaks in Bangladesh and North Bengal in India, and
Chandipura virus has been implicated elsewhere in India. A lack of a
definitive diagnosis of Japanese encephalitis now 6 weeks following the 1st
newswire posting might be considered cause for concern. - Mod.MPP]
