Honduras: rabies detected in Progress
-------------------------------------
A vaccination campaign is being advanced to prevent the risk of spreading
rabies. Upon detection of a case of rabies in El Progreso, Yoro,
authorities in the Health Region of the Department of Cortez number 5 have
decided to advance the vaccination of dogs in the municipalities near the
city to avoid the risk of spreading the disease.

Delia Third, an epidemiologist at the institution, announced that they are
working together with other regions to address this danger. Of the 12 towns
of Cortez, 11 are in charge of Health Region 5, which are Choloma, La Lima,
Omoa, Pepper, Potrerillos Puerto Cortes, San Antonio, San Francisco de
Yojoa, San Manuel, Santa Cruz de Yojoa and Villanueva. Only San Pedro Sula
is handled separately in this region.

[Increasing vaccination of dogs (and cats) helps build a barrier between
rabies and humans, while protecting the pets as well.

The article does not tell us the strain of rabies [indeed it does not state
that the case was identified in a dog. - Mod.SH]. So we do not know if this
is a fox strain or a skunk strain or something else. Perhaps other
information will be forthcoming soon. - Mod.TG
