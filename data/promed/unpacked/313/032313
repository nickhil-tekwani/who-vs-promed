Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Russia
-----------------------------------------
Information received on 11 Jun 2015 from Dr Evgeny Nepoklonov, Deputy Head, Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance, Ministry of Agriculture, Moscow, Russia.

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 28 May 2015
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 9 Jun 2015
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 27 Apr 2015
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N1
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic), laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Ubsu-Nur, Ovyursky, Respublika Tyva [Tuva]
Date of start of the outbreak: 28 May 2015
Outbreak status: resolved 10 Jun 2015
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Great crested grebe: _Podiceps cristatus_ (Podicipedidae) / - / 2 / 2 / 0 / 0
Common tern: _Sterna hirundo_ (Laridae) / - / 2 / 2 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments: During the active monitoring of the ornithofauna in the surroundings of Ubsu-Nur Lake, a few wild birds were found dead. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 was detected and isolated in samples from carcasses of 2 great crested grebes and 2 common terns. No HPAI virus H5N1 has been detected in samples from healthy migratory birds of different species: great crested grebes (_Podiceps cristatus_), great cormorant (_Phalacrocorax carbo_), red-crested pochard (_Netta rufina_), gadwall (_Anas strepera_), common tern (_Sterna hirundo_), common coot (_Fulica atra_), black-headed gull (_Larus ridibundus_). Sequence analysis of the isolates showed that they belonged to the Asian HPAI virus H5N1 lineage, clade 2.3.2.1, and had close similarity with previous Russian H5N1 virus isolates of years 2014-2015.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs, screening, no vaccination, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: All-Russian Research Institute for Animal Health (FGBI-ARRIAH) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Common tern / real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 9 Jun 2015 / Positive
Common tern / virus isolation / 9 Jun 2015 / Positive
Great crested grebe / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR)/ 9 Jun 2015/ Positive
Great crested grebe / virus isolation / 9 Jun 2015 / Positive

[The Ubsunur (Uvs Nuur) is a large (70 km by 80 km), shallow (up to 15 m) saline lake located between Russia's Tyva (Tuva) Republic and Mongolia in the western part of the vast internal drainage intermontane basin.

The fauna list of the Ubsunur Hollow Reserve counts about 80 mammals and over 350 bird species. Ubsunur lake with the adjacent bogged meadows and solonchaks (salt marshes) attracts a lot of geese, swans, Charadriiformes, herons, cormorants, gulls, terns and other waterfowl and nearwater bird species (http://www.nhpfund.org/nominations/uvs-nuur.html).

The great crested grebe is a widespread Old World grebe breeding in Eurasia, Africa and Australasia. In Eurasia, it breeds across most of the continent from Iberia and the British Isles eastwards ranging north to central parts of Sweden and Finland and south to the Mediterranean coast and Turkey. Its range extends eastwards across Asia to China and locally in Japan but absent from most of Arabia, India and Southeast Asia (http://www.birdforum.net/opus/Great_Crested_Grebe).

The common tern has a circumpolar distribution, breeding in temperate and sub-arctic regions of Europe, Asia and east and central North America. It is strongly migratory, wintering in the subtropical and tropical oceans. It is sometimes known as the sea swallow (http://www.birdforum.net/opus/Common_Tern). - Mod.CRD
