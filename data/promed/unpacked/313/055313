China: More Cases of of Japanese Encephalitis in Guangdong Province
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Another 77 residents have been hospitalized in China's Guangdong Province
with the potentially fatal encephalitis B [Japanese encephalitis] disease
in the past 5 days. The sudden surge in patients has been met with a
renewed pledge from provincial health chiefs to step up efforts to fight
the disease that has killed 24 people in Guangdong.
The new encephalitis B [Japanese encephalitis] cases reported this week
brought Guangdong's total number of patients with the disease to 297 by
noon on Fri 27 Jun 2003, stated an official from the Guangdong Provincial
Bureau of Public Health. The disease appeared in the province in the middle
of last month.
One of the new cases is a 21-year-old man, officials said. He is believed
to have contracted the disease in Shenzhen. [This] patient from outside the
city is now in Shenzhen's Donghu Hospital receiving treatment in isolation.
Shenzhen's Donghu Hospital has now been designated as a special hospital to
treat encephalitis B [Japanese encephalitis] patients. It was the first
case to have been reported in the special economic zone. "The Shenzhen case
has also indicated that adults can also be infected with the encephalitis B
[Japanese encephalitis] virus," the official said. About 90 percent of
Guangdong's current encephalitis B [Japanese encephalitis] patients are
children aged under 11 years old.
Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, has detected a total of 4
patients with dengue fever since April [2003]. All the dengue fever
patients are local residents living in the city's Tianhe District. Two are
still in hospital receiving treatment. They are in stable condition.
Guangzhou has detected a total of 10 encephalitis B [Japanese encephalitis]
patients so far. A special task force has been established to treat
patients and prevent the 2 diseases from spreading in the province which
borders the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions. The task
force mainly comprises senior government officials and senior doctors.
Encephalitis B [Japanese encephalitis] has been detected in many cities in
the province, the official said. Encephalitis B [Jaapanese encephalitis]
usually hits its infectious peak in Guangdong between May and July. The
Guangdong Provincial Bureau of Public Health [indicated that] more than 100
000 children in the whole province [had been] vaccinated against
encephalitis B [Japanese encephalitis] since the beginning of the outbreak.
In addition to Guangzhou and Shenzhen, encephalitis B has been diagnosed in
Zhanjiang, Maoming, Meizhou, Shanwei, Yunfu, Heyuan, Jieyang, Dongguan,
Zhongshan and Qingyuan. The official has urged local residents not to panic
as both encephalitis B [Japanese encephalitis] and dengue fever can be
treated and are preventable. And a campaign to wipe out mosquitoes has been
launched in Guangzhou this week, the official said.

[The Chinese media remain attached to an earlier name (epidemic
encephalitis B) for the disease associated with Japanese encephalitis virus
infection. I am grateful to Geoff Chubb and Martin Haditsch for correcting
my erroneous attribution of the derivation of this name in the previous
post. The term epidemic encephalitis B was introduced in the 1930's to
distinguish this type of viral encephalitis from encephalitis lethargica or
encephalitis A (a meningo-encephalomyelitis also known as Von Economo's
disease). - Mod.CP]
