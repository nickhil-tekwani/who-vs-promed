Alert: Washington County, GA, becomes 15th GA county with rust
--------------------------------------------------------------
Soybean leaf samples collected from sentinel plots in Washington County,
Georgia were confirmed at low incidence as Asian soybean rust [ASR] on Fri
2 Sep 2004. Washington becomes the 15th Georgia county with rust.
Bob Kemerait, assistant professor and extension specialist at the
University of Georgia, said in this afternoon's [2 Sep 2005] state
commentary that Layla Sconyers pulled the leaves from the MG II-III
soybeans in the plot, netting only 3 leaves out of 100 with visible
pustules, and they were sparse. He added in today's report that ASR was not
found on recent samples submitted by county agents from commercial fields
in Madison and Schley counties, nor on kudzu from Meriwether or Troup counties.
According to Kermerait, soybean rust has been identified in numerous
sentinel plots and in fungicide trials in the Coastal Plain. "Although
almost certainly present in commercial fields, ASR rust has only been
confirmed in one commercial field. Very likely, the severity in commercial
fields is so low that it is not being observed by growers."
Washington County is a large county just south and east of the central
point of the state. It is a county away from Putnam to the north and
Laurens to its southwest, both counties infected with rust in 2005.

[ASR is still spreading, but it is likely not to be a factor too much
longer. Plants in many fields and plots are already mature, but spore
deposition will continue.
