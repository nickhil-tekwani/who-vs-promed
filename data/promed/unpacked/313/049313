We would like to give information on anthrax incidence in West Java.

This disease affected dairy cattle in Pasuruan (East Java) in December 2002.

And in West Java in 2006, there were 3 cattle deaths and a human
case, who died, in the Depok Regency.

[Adji is a research scientist in the anthrax laboratory at the Bogor
Institute in West Java and personally collected these data in
Pasuruan (East Java) and Depok Regency (West Java). We are doubly
appreciative as the Indonesian reports to OIE (World Organisation for
Animal Health), Paris, are laconic at best. Thank you. - Mod.MHJ]
