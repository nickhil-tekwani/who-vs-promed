Highlights
----------
- Marburg virus (MARV) persists in the testes of macaque survivors after treatment
- MARV infiltrates macaque testes late in infection
- MARV persists in testicular Sertoli cells, thereby disrupting tissue barrier integrity
- Local immunosuppressive T-reg cell infiltration may sustain persistent infection

Summary
-------
Sexual transmission of filoviruses was 1st reported in 1968 after an outbreak of Marburg virus (MARV) disease and recently caused flare-ups of Ebola virus disease in the 2013-2016 outbreak. How filoviruses establish testicular persistence and are shed in semen remains unknown. We discovered that persistent MARV infection of seminiferous tubules, an immune-privileged site that harbors sperm production, is a relatively common event in crab-eating macaques that survived infection after antiviral treatment. Persistence triggers severe testicular damage, including spermatogenic cell depletion and inflammatory cell invasion. MARV mainly persists in Sertoli cells, leading to breakdown of the blood-testis barrier formed by inter-Sertoli cell tight junctions. This disruption is accompanied by local infiltration of immunosuppressive CD4- positive Foxp3-positive regulatory T cells. Our study elucidates cellular events associated with testicular persistence that may promote sexual transmission of filoviruses and suggests that targeting immunosuppression may be warranted to clear filovirus persistence in damaged immune-privileged sites.

[There have been sporadic cases of Marburg in the past and are likely to occur in the future, so persistence of virus in semen with the risk of sexual transmission is epidemiologically important. Sexual transmission of filoviruses such as Marburg and, especially the Ebola viruses, following recovery from the acute infection adds a complication for surveillance and control following outbreaks. The above report describes the factors responsible for virus persistence in testicular tissue. Persistence of Ebola virus in semen is well documented. A New England Journal of Medicine (NEMJ) article titled Molecular Evidence of Sexual Transmission of Ebola Virus (ref.1), reports on the examination of semen and vaginal-secretion samples collected from survivors in Liberia in March and April 2015. The case report describes one case of human-to-human EBOV transmission through sexual contact. A pilot study, also published in the NEMJ, Ebola RNA Persistence in Semen of Ebola Virus Disease Survivors (ref.2) showed Ebola is able to live longer in the testes than previously known. Among the samples, Ebola virus RNA was detected in the semen of 11 of 43 (26 percent) men 7 to 9 months after the onset of disease. The risk of sexual transmission of filoviruses needs to be further investigated in order to issue guidelines for measures needed to avoid transmission.
