Health officials said Friday [22 Aug 2008] that 5 deaths have now
been linked to a food-borne bacterial outbreak, including the 1st
confirmed death outside of Ontario. In the latest death linked to the
outbreak of listeriosis, a BC [British Columbia] man died after
eating tainted meat he was served in hospital. The case raised the
frightening spectre that tainted meat may have been consumed in
hospitals and care homes across the country.

The man, a 64-year-old Vancouver Island resident, died at Cowichan
District Hospital from the illness, which has been linked to the
consumption of tainted luncheon meat that was the subject of a
nationwide recall.

"We just got confirmation today [22 Aug 2008] from the Public Health
Agency of Canada that it's the outbreak strain," said Dr Lorna Medd,
medical health officer with the Vancouver Island Health Authority.

The man died on 29 Jul 2008 at the hospital in Duncan, about 60
kilometres (37 mi) north of Victoria, but it took time to confirm the
cause of death, the health authority said. "This incident occurred
prior to the Canada-wide recall of certain Maple Leaf products," the
BC Centre for Disease Control said in a statement late Friday [22 Aug
2008].

The tainted meat was possibly served on Vancouver Island at Cowichan
District Hospital as well as Victoria General Hospital, Royal Jubilee
Hospital, Saanich Peninsula Hospital, Queen Alexandra Hospital,
Aberdeen, Glengarry, Mount Tolmie, the Priory, Gorge Road Hospital,
Cairnsmore Place, and Cowichan Lodge in Duncan and Tofino Hospital.
The product has now been removed from these sites and all other local
health authority sites.

To date, 4 other deaths have been linked to listeriosis by health
authorities in Ontario and they are investigating whether 3 more
deaths were related to the disease. Dr Richard Schabas, medical
officer of health for Hastings and Prince Edward counties, said the
most recently confirmed death was an elderly man. "We had a death
from Hastings-Prince Edward counties, someone who we've now
identified as part of the _Listeria monocytogenes_ outbreak. The
death occurred in the middle of July [2008]," Schabas said. He said
the number of deaths linked to listeriosis is likely to climb.

Earlier Friday [22 Aug 2008], a Niagara public health official said
tests confirmed the death of an elderly woman who lived in St
Catharines, ON [Ontario], was related to the listeriosis outbreak.
The health authority in Waterloo, ON, confirmed a 2nd death, while
the Hamilton health authority announced the 1st related death
Thursday [21 Aug 2008].

Niagara Public Health spokeswoman Carrie Beatty said a 2nd death of a
resident from Niagara Falls, ON, was also under investigation, but
results are expected to be available until next week. "We are saying
it's probably because of contributing factors, like the time frame
and the fact the person resided in a retirement home," said Beatty of
the 2nd Niagara case.

There are at least 30 probable cases of the outbreak in Ontario and
more are expected, according to Dr David Williams, Ontario's acting
chief medical officer of health.

While the investigation continues, Maple Leaf Foods, Canada's biggest
food processor, has temporarily closed its north Toronto meat
processing plant and has initiated special sanitation procedures
there. Maple Leaf said none of the suspect meat had crossed the
border into the USA.

The tainted deli-meat crisis at Maple Leaf Foods will cost the
company at least [CAD] 20 million [USD 19.12 million], it said Sunday
[24 Aug 2008], 10 times more than originally expected as it pulls
more than 220 products off shelves across the country.

Its Toronto processing facility was confirmed over the weekend [23-24
Aug 2008] as the source of a listeria outbreak tied to 4 deaths and
dozens of illnesses. Maple Leaf has recalled more than 570 000
kilograms (1.26 million lb) of meat produced at the plant, although
production continues at its other 22 facilities across the country.

Chief executive officer Michael McCain updated the company's costs at
a Sunday [24 Aug 2008] press conference, saying the money would be
spent reimbursing customers for returned products and sanitizing its
factory. He warned the figure was liable to change, if the company
increases its advertising budget amid lower sales.

Most recently, the Public Health Agency of Canada has confirmed that
there are 21 cases of the listeriosis outbreak confirmed in 4
provinces. The agency said 16 of the cases were found in Ontario, 3
in British Columbia, and one each in Saskatchewan and in Quebec.

The public health agency also said it suspects 30 more cases may be
linked to the listeria outbreak. Of those, 14 are in Ontario, 8 are
in Quebec, 4 are in Alberta, and 2 each are in British Columbia and
Saskatchewan.

The Maple Leaf recall, which began with a couple of brands a week
ago, now extends to everything from the company's Bartor Road plant
in Toronto, more than 200 products.

Brands include Artisan Collection, Best Value, Bittners,
Bittners/Schneiders, Boston Pizza, Burns, Campfire, Compliments,
Coorsh, Country Morning, Equality, Fleetwood, Foodservice, Generic,
Harmonie, Hickory Farms, Hygrade, Kirkland Signature, Main Street
Deli, Maple Leaf, Mayfair/Marque, McDonalds, Mitchell's, Mr. Sub, No
Name, Northern Best Value, Olympic, Our Compliments, Overlander,
Parma, Safeway, Schneiders, and Shopsys.

A full list of recalled products is available at
<http://files.newswire.ca/464/RecallList.pdf>.

McCain said consumers could return any Maple Leaf product with 97B on
the label, code for the Bartor Road plant, to their retailer for a
refund.

[ProMED thanks Kate Kelley for sending in a similar report.
This ongoing outbreak illustrates that almost all cases of
listeriosis are foodborne and appropriate genetic testing of isolates
on a large-scale basis will show relatedness of geographically
separated infections. Additionally, since listeriosis primarily
occurs in the elderly and in cellularly immunoincompetent people as
well as in pregnant women, the serving of high risk foods in
hospitals and homes for the elderly should be eliminated. As an
example, there is no reason to feed deli cold cuts as a lunch to a
hospitalized patient under treatment for lymphoma. - Mod.LL]
