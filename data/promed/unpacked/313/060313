This was a case of bubonic plague. The patient had flea bites on the left
ankle and a left inguinal bubo. Rock squirrels collected in the vicinity of
the patient's home were heavily infested with fleas, and fleas were
collected from burrows in the area. Rodent blood and tissue and fleas are
en route to CDC-Division of Vector Borne Infectious Diseases in Fort
Collins, CO for testing.
