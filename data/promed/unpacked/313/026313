The health services of the Misdalah district east of Bouira have appealed to the heads and residents of its municipalities to avoid the acquisition and consumption of milk and all its derivatives of unknown source and offered for sale on the roads and some shops, in order to avoid infection with brucellosis, from which several confirmed cases of infection were recorded in the population.

The announcement published by the neighborhood's health services in Hanif stated that, according to the detection of a confirmed case of human brucellosis for a person living in the village of Texiridan. In the village, from the municipality of Al-Shorfa, epidemiological investigations conducted by the services confirmed that the cause of infection is the acquisition and consumption of fresh milk from several shops in the region.

Therefore, according to the same services, mayors of municipalities must intensify supervision to prevent the spread of the disease, and the residents of the region should avoid getting or consuming milk and all its derivatives of animal origin of unknown origin, especially those offered for sale on the roads or in public places without supervision, as well as some shops. This should be done in order to protect their private and public health due to the health symptoms that the disease causes, which may lead to death, in addition to the fear of the infection spreading more among them, whether by consuming these materials, especially unboiled milk, or by direct contact with the blood of infected animals such as sheep, sheep and goats.

Of note, the agricultural and veterinary services of the wilaya (State) of Bouira, after discovering more than 10 cases of human brucellosis, had launched, months ago, a wide campaign to sensitize farmers to vaccinate their livestock against brucellosis and foot-and-mouth disease, harnessing its agents and private veterinarians. However, many breeders and farmers refuse every time to vaccinate their livestock, which makes them vulnerable to those diseases whose infection is transmitted to human This, in addition to the phenomenon of selling milk and its derivatives (products) on public roads and in some stores without knowing their source and the extent of infection --especially with their consumption without boiling --, increases the possibility of infection.

This infection, a bacterial zoonosis, is classified among the category B biowarfare agents. Natural transmission to humans occurs after occupational exposure or through ingestion of contaminated food products. Although brucellosis has become a rare entity in the USA and many industrialized nations because of animal vaccination programs, this condition remains a significant health problem in many developing countries.

Each species of _Brucella_ has a specific animal reservoir in which chronic disease is present. The bacilli tend to localize in the reproductive organs of the animals, causing sterility and abortions and are shed in large numbers in the animal's urine, milk, and placental fluid. This localization allows for efficient spread to farmers, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, and consumers.

Among the 4 species known to cause disease in humans, _B. melitensis_ (from goats, sheep, or camels) may be the most virulent, producing the most severe and acute cases of brucellosis, with disabling complications. A prolonged course of illness, which may be associated with suppurative destructive lesions, is associated with _B. suis_ (from feral or commercially raised pigs) infection. _B. abortus_ (from cattle, buffalo, and camels) is associated with mild-to-moderate sporadic disease that is rarely associated with complications. - Mod.LL
