9 May 1997
Cholera
Somalia. A total of 4437 cholera cases with 146 deaths
have been reported since the end of November 1996 to 7 May
1997 although the real number of cases is believed to be
higher because of the difficulty of data collection. Weekly
reports have been made by NGOs working in the country as
well as by the local authorities where available.
A total of over 2 000 cases with 74 deaths has been recorded
in the epidemic in Mogadishu but it appears that it has
now passed its peak, although high levels are still being
reported. Intensified efforts are still necessary to
guarantee sufficient supplies to all NGOs involved and
continued vigilance is needed, especially in those areas not
yet affected by this epidemic.
WHO is supporting the NGO's and local authorities by
providing technical support and supplies.
