The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) and the Eau Claire County Health Department announced [Wed 2 Sep 2020] that laboratory testing has confirmed the 1st human case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus infection this year [2020].

DHS and Eau Claire County Health Department are reminding everyone to protect themselves from mosquito bites by using mosquito repellent any time they are outside.

According to a release, the news of a human case of EEE comes after the state announced last week that horses in 3 northwestern Wisconsin counties were infected with the virus.

Officials say EEE is a rare but potentially fatal disease, that can affect people of all ages. It can be spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes acquire EEE virus by feeding on infected birds. The virus is not spread person to person or between humans and animals.

The last human case of EEE in Wisconsin was reported in 2017.

[Cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus infections occur sporadically in horses and much less frequently in humans in Wisconsin. As mentioned above, there have been recent equine EEE cases in northwestern Wisconsin again this year (2020). There have been equine EEE cases in the state every year for the past 5 years and less frequently prior to that. Other species have been affected in Wisconsin as well: alpacas in 2019 and 2011 and an emu in 2016.

There has been concern about the risk of EEE virus infections for the endangered whooping cranes that are present as breeding birds at the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wisconsin, and free-ranging whooping cranes that summer in Wisconsin wetlands. These birds are susceptible to infection by this virus and may suffer mortality.

Equine animals in Wisconsin should be vaccinated annually. There is no commercially available vaccine for humans, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the only available preventive measure available. - Mod.TY
