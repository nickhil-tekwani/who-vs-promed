An investigation has been launched after 12 people died following an outbreak of a bacterial infection in Braintree [Essex].

The Mid Essex CCG [Clinical Commissioning Groups, which are responsible for delivery of NHS services in England https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_commissioning_group] has revealed there have been 32 cases of the group A streptococcal [_Streptococcus pyogenes_] infection recorded since February this year [2019].

The majority of cases are said to have occurred in the Braintree area but some people in Maldon and Chelmsford have also been affected.

Most of the patients affected are elderly and had been receiving care for chronic wounds in the community either in their own homes and or in care homes.

Details of the outbreak were first revealed in Mid Essex CCG board papers, which will be further discussed in a meeting on [Thu 27 Jun 2019]. The report states: "Group A streptococcus (GAS) can be found in the throat and on the skin and people may carry group A streptococci in the throat or on the skin and have no symptoms of illness. It can live in throats and on hands for long enough to allow easy spread between people through sneezing, kissing and skin contact. Sometimes life-threatening GAS disease may occur when bacteria get into parts of the body where bacteria usually are not found, such as the blood, muscle, or the lungs."

The board papers go on to state an incident management team has been set up to control the outbreak and closely monitor the situation.

A cause of the spread of the infection has not yet been identified and a full investigation is being carried out to understand how it may have spread and any additional control measures required.

The report has also revealed there has been a single case of the iGAS [invasive GAS] infection reported in Basildon in 2018 and another in Southend in February 2019. However, it states there appears to be no direct link between these cases and the cases in mid Essex.

Rachel Hearn, Director of Nursing and Quality, Mid Essex Clinical Commissioning Group said: "Our thoughts are with the families of those patients who have died. The NHS in Essex is working closely with Public Health England and other partners to manage this local incident, and extra infection control measures have been put in place to prevent the infection spreading in the area. The risk of contracting iGAS is very low for the vast majority of people and treatment with antibiotics is very effective if started early. We will continue to work with our partners in Public Health England to investigate how this outbreak occurred and take every possible step to ensure our local community is protected."

Anyone who is worried can call a Freephone helpline on 03000 032124. The helpline is open Monday to Friday between 9am to 5pm. The CCG says it will continue to keep patients updated on the outbreak via its website.

[This outbreak of invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) infection (32 cases with 12 deaths, case fatality rate=37.5%, since Feb 2019) is reported to be occurring mainly in Essex, a county in the southeast of England, northeast of London (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex). Cases are occurring mainly in the Essex districts of Braintree (population 147 084 residents), with smaller numbers in Maldon (population 64 000 residents) and Chelmsford (population 176 200 residents). Single cases of iGAS infection were reported in districts of Basildon (population 184 500 residents) in 2018 and Southend (population 181 800 residents) in February 2019. A map showing the location of these districts can be found at https://www.mapsofworld.com/england/counties/essex-map.html. Essex has a total population of about 1.8 million residents in 2017 (incidence rate for iGAS infection 1.8 per 100 000). A map of England showing the location of Essex can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/iKJzCisS6o8GAPKJ8. The CDC estimates approximately 11 000 to 13 000 cases of iGAS disease occur each year in the United States and each year between 1100 and 1600 people die due to iGAS (https://www.cdc.gov/groupastrep/surveillance.html).

GAS, also called _Streptococcus pyogenes_, are Gram-positive cocci that grow in chains. Most often, GAS cause localized infections, such as pharyngitis ("strep throat") or impetigo. Sometimes, GAS invade the lungs (pneumonia), blood (bacteremia), meningitis, toxic shock syndrome, or spread along the layers of tissue that surround muscle (fasciitis ). These infections are called invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) disease and are very serious, even life-threatening. However, we are not told what types of iGAS infection are involved in this outbreak in Essex.

Predisposing factors for iGAS infection include influenza for pneumonia, and skin lesions, poor personal hygiene, crowding in shelters for the homeless, and injection drug use for necrotizing fasciitis. Most of the patients in the Essex outbreak reportedly are elderly and had been receiving care for chronic wounds in the community either in their own homes and or in care homes. We are not told if any of the cases are clustered in particular nursing homes or have anything else that may link them.

M protein is the major virulence factor of GAS, which are divided into serotypes based on the antigenic differences in the M protein molecule. More recently, GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the _emm_ gene that encodes M serospecificity (http://medbox.iiab.me/modules/en-cdc/www.cdc.gov/streplab/m-proteingene-typing.html). The news report does not specify the M protein types are involved in the current Essex outbreak. Molecular typing of isolates may aid in documenting whether the Essex outbreak is caused by a common strain or if multiple different strains are involved.

More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
