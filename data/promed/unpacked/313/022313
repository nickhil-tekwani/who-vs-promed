Tick-borne encephalitis - Russia (Chelyabinsk oblast)
-----------------------------------------------------
This year about 16 000 people in the Chelyabinsk oblast reported
being bitten by ticks in its forests and 74 of them were diagnosed
with tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). Although the numbers are 8.6
percent lower than during the previous year [2009], the risk of TBE
virus infection is considerable.

Scientists have reported that ticks of the genus _Dermacentor_ genus
have become more active recently. They advise that the autumn is the
optimal time for immunization against TBE virus infection, since the
high risk season is from Spring to Summer and protective immunity
takes some time to develop. It is planned this autumn to immunize
more than 30 000 1st-grade pupils in the Chelyabinsk oblast.

[Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a viral infectious disease that
attacks the central nervous system and can result in long-term
neurological symptoms, and even death. Tick-borne encephalitis is
caused by a virus (genus _Flavivirus_, family _Flaviviridae_) which
includes . subtypes. TBE has become a growing public health challenge
in Europe and other parts of the world. The number of human cases of
TBE in all endemic regions of Europe has increased by almost 400
percent in the last 30 years; the risk areas have spread and new foci
have been discovered (See:
<http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/spotlight/spotlight_tickborne/Pages/home.aspx>).

The Chelyabinsk Oblast (Region) is located at the boundary between
Europe and Asia in the southern Ural mountains. It is situated in the
watershed of the Volga, Ural and Tobol rivers. Chelyabinsk Region has
nearly 3170 lakes and a variety of therapeutic springs and mud baths.
In fact the Chelyabinsk Oblast is highly industrialised and ranks 5th
in Russia in terms of industrial output.
