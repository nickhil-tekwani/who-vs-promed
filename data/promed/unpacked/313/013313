Scotland: European Bat Lyssavirus-infected Patient Dies in Dundee Hospital
---------------------------------------------------
A wildlife artist who contracted rabies from a bat died last night. The
56-year-old patient, who was being treated in Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, is
the first victim of the disease in Britain for 100 years. NHS Tayside, the
health board, confirmed that the patient died last night at the hospital,
where he had been in an isolation unit. The board had said earlier that
tests had confirmed that the patient was suffering from infection with [a]
European bat lyssavirus, a [species] of rabies [virus] known to exist in
several north European countries. The patient, from Guthrie, Angus, had
worked with bats for 15 years and had been bitten on at least one occasion,
although it may never be known where and when he was bitten by an infected
bat.
The patient had a licence to handle bats issued by the wildlife agency
Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), for which he had carried out research. He
had travelled the world pursuing his hobby and many of his artistic studies
were of otters and bats around his home and remote parts of Scotland. A
spokesman for SNH said last night that the patient's death was a "bleak day
for everyone involved in conservation in Scotland". The wildlife agency took
the step of suspending all but a few bat handling licences after the
patient's condition became known.
Drew Walker, NHS Tayside director of public health, stressed that the only
members of the general public who might be at risk from the infection are
those who handle bats or who have been bitten or scratched by them. Clinical
staff involved in the treatment of the patient would continue to be offered
advice and vaccination where appropriate, the health board said. In Europe,
where European bat lyssaviruses [there are 2 types] are common, there have
only been 3 cases of humans [developing] rabies since 1977. This is the
first case of indigenous rabies in Britain since 1902. Residents of Guthrie
were stunned when it emerged the patient was in a critical condition last
week. Less than 2 weeks ago he complained to a neighbour he was feeling ill
and had a pain in his arm.

[It has been reported on BBC Radio that several other bat handlers in the
same area (who wished to remain anonymous) had been bitten by bats during
the same period. All are believed to have received post-exposure treatment
with the exception of the deceased patient, who had declined treatment. It
has also been reported that the patient had been bitten by a Daubenton's
bat, a species from which EBLV 2 had been isolated in northwestern England
some months previously, although the statement from NHS Tayside does not
identify the species of the virus or the vector. It remains to be
established whether the deceased patent was infected with EBLV 1 or EBLV 2,
closely related but distinct viruses. It can be assumed for the moment that
EBLV 2 was responsible for the patient's death, since no case of rabies has
developed among those bitten by bats following post-exposure treatment with
standard rabies vaccine.
As commented in an earlier post [Rabies (EBLV 2), human - UK (Scotland):
susp (03)], there is some doubt as to the cross-protective efficacy of
rabies vaccine against European bat lyssavirus 1, which has not been
recorded in the UK. Daubenton's bat (_Myotis daubentonii_) is a medium-sized
species that occurs throughout Europe up to about 63 degrees N, across to
Korea and Japan. It is though to be increasing in numbers in parts of
Europe. In Britain it is fairly widespread up to northern Scotland, in
Ireland, and the Isle of Man. Despite severe loss of and damage to wetlands
and waterways, Daubenton's bat seems to be increasing in parts of its range.
This may, in part, be associated with increasing numbers of artificial water
bodies, including gravel pits, reservoirs, and flooded quarries and a more
consistent supply of chironomid midges. A consequence of this may be the
emergence of bat-transmitted rabies as a human disease in the UK.
The PHLS website states that: "It is very rare for European bat lyssaviruses
to cross the "species barrier"; this means that even if bats are known to be
carrying the virus within a country or region, it is rare for other animals
to be infected. Nonetheless, it can happen. On 2 occasions, sheep infected
with the virus have been found, and on one occasion the virus was found in a
stone marten [a ferret-like animal. - Mod.JW].

Only 3 human cases have been reported in Europe since 1977, one in Finland
and 2 in the former USSR, despite over 600 cases in bats. All 3 have been in
people who had been in close contact with bats and had not received
treatment after their exposure. - Mod.CP]
