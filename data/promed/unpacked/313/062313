I wish that Dr Ruck had mentioned, in addition to the precautions
recommended to adults who purchase lamp oil, a much more effective
way of preventing poisoning from toxic substances that look like food
and come in containers that look like food containers.

Unfortunately, many purchasers will forget on at least one occasion
to handle and store this toxic liquid safely. It takes only one such
slip in safety practices by the purchaser to cause a tragedy.

All purchasers and their families and guests would be protected from
nightmares such as the one in the post if manufacturers of lamp oil
are requested (or compelled by law if requests fail) to change the
appearance of their containers and add a coloring agent (dark green,
gray, or blue would be good choices) that does not make the lamp oil
appear appetizing or mimic a common beverage.

One hallmark of successful public health interventions is that they
require the smallest number of actions and the smallest number of
people to carry them out.
