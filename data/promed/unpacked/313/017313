The Ugandan Ministry of Health declared a yellow fever outbreak earlier this month [May 2019] after laboratory confirmed cases were reported from Koboko [Northern region] and Masaka [Central region] districts (in the region of 600km [375 miles] apart). The patients are an 80 year old woman and a 10 year old girl. Neither had a history of yellow fever vaccination, nor exhibited symptoms of jaundice, however the older woman had hemorrhagic signs.

A district rapid response team was sent to the affected localities to conduct further investigation. The team sampled several households and found a substantial population of unvaccinated individuals due to immigration and missing the yellow fever reactive vaccination campaign, which was conducted in 2016. There were 7 suspected cases who met the case definition for yellow fever from whom additional samples were collected.

Yellow fever is a viral disease that is transmitted by mosquitoes belonging to the _Aedes_ species. Yellow fever can lead to serious illness and even death. Yellow fever vaccine is the best protection against yellow fever disease, which can be fatal.

[The prompt recognition of cases and timely mounting of the vaccination campaign in 2016 were key to successfully ending the outbreak before it got out-of-hand. That outbreak was due to spill-over of endemic sylvan (forest) transmission from monkeys via mosquitoes to people and this sylvan (forest) transmission may have been responsible for the 2 confirmed and 7 suspected cases mentioned above. The virus doubtless has been circulating in the forests of Uganda, so the risk of new spill-over cases is real. One hopes that the rapid response team sent to the locality where the cases occurred can prevent further cases from occurring or the initiation of an urban transmission cycle. - Mod.TY
