Although _Bacillus cereus_ is known mainly as an agent of food poisoning,
other infections caused by this organism have been documented in
immunocompromised patients, including sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, and
wound infections (1, 2). Certain populations are at increased risk for _B.
cereus_ infection, including cancer patients, neonates, intravenous drug
users, and patients with a history of trauma, surgery, or catheterization
(3-6). Primary cutaneous disease attributed to _B. cereus_ in
immunocompetent persons or in non-health-care settings rarely has been
reported (7). This report is the 1st to document such an outbreak.
On 24 Aug 2004, a local health department in Georgia received a call from a
university health center describing 90 cadets with nonpruritic,
impetigo-like lesions on their scalps; _B. cereus_ was the common organism
among the 3 patients whose lesions were cultured. The cases occurred during
the freshman military orientation week that preceded the start of the fall
term. The Georgia Division of Public Health (GDPH) conducted an
investigation to determine the source of the infections, identify
associated risk factors, and implement control measures. This report
summarizes the results of the outbreak investigation, which identified
receiving a short haircut at the start of orientation week, sharing
sunscreen during the week, and membership in Company B as strongly
associated with having scalp lesions. Recommendations to the university
included changing the type of haircut required, increasing time allowed for
showering, and issuing individual sunscreen. The results of this
investigation underscore the need for military programs to incorporate good
hygiene and infection-control measures into school orientation events.
GDPH reviewed the events of orientation week, investigated cases of scalp
dermatitis, collected environmental samples, and conducted a cohort study
of participants in the military program during 4 site visits to the
university. University personnel provided a schedule of orientation
activities and a tour of each event location. Medical records from patients
were reviewed and clinical findings discussed with university health-care
staff. Patients were interviewed, and available clinical isolates were sent
to the Georgia Public Health Laboratory for confirmation. Samples,
including talc, Barbicide(r) disinfectant, and swabs of electric clippers,
were collected from 2 barbershops providing haircuts to cadets. Soil and
water samples were collected from event sites, and swabs were taken of
shared helmets and sunscreen. 5 patients donated their hats for the
environmental and laboratory investigation. CDC analyzed the environmental
samples and characterized bacterial isolates by biochemical analysis, 16S
rRNA gene sequencing (8), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) (9).
After the initial investigation, GDPH conducted a cohort study of all
cadets in the military program at the university. GDPH distributed
questionnaires to all 660 cadets, including upperclassmen, 3 weeks after
orientation week. The cadets were asked about demographic information,
company and dormitory assignment, clinical symptoms, orientation event
participation, exposure to soil and water, and hygiene practices, including
laundry, bathing, and shared products. A case was defined as an occurrence
of scalp lesions in a cadet treated with oral cephalexin from the school
health center during 10-30 Aug 2004. Measures of association were estimated
using multivariate logistic regression to control for confounding.
The 4-year military program at the university had 660 students (292
freshman and 368 upperclassmen) organized into 7 discrete companies. Cadets
lived in 5 separate dormitories, 2 per room, organized by company, sex, and
class year. Each floor shared a bathroom and a common living room.
Orientation directly involved 292 freshmen; 115 upperclassmen supervised
the events. Orientation started with a short haircut for all 255 freshman
males at 1 of 2 civilian barbershops.
Haircuts were performed by 1 of 8 barbers in random order using electric
clippers without a scalp guard. The 3rd day of orientation week, the cadets
completed an obstacle course involving immersion in mud and river water. On
the final day, participants were required to rappel from rock walls and
participate in survival training exercises. Helmets were worn and sunscreen
was shared among cadets during these activities.
94 (14 percent) of 660 cadets had scalp lesions, and 1 cadet was infected
twice during the period from the start of orientation to when the
questionnaire was administered. 33 patients sought care at the student
health center on the 4th day of orientation week, and 57 sought care on the
5th day. 5 more cases, including the recurrent case, occurred 1 week after
the start of school [for figure see original URL - Mod. LL]. All patients
participated in orientation week; all were male and ranged in age from 16
to 24 years. The majority of patients were freshmen (84/94; 89 percent) and
received a haircut on the 1st day of orientation (89/94; 95 percent).
Approximately 1/3 of the patients (33/94; 35 percent) were in Company B.
The index patient noted onset of symptoms on the 3rd day of orientation.
Yellow sticky discharge followed by honey-colored crusts on the crown of
his head were noted. Lesions were nonpruritic. Other patients had similar
lesions with the same distribution. Infections resolved within 48 hours
with the use of antibacterial soap and oral cephalexin (5-day
prescription). Health care providers obtained samples for culture from
lesions of 3 cadets [for table see original URL - Mod. LL]. _B.
cereus_ was the only common organism isolated from all 3 patients and was
identified by using biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. When
analyzed by MLST, all 3 clinical B. cereus isolates were indistinguishable.
_B. cereus_ also was cultured from 2 separate barbershop clippers (2
isolates), soil from the school grounds and orientation events (5
isolates), and helmets (2 isolates) worn during rappelling exercises. 5
environmental isolates (3 soil samples and 2 clippers) matched the clinical
isolates by 16S rRNA. MLST was performed on these isolates, resulting in 4
unique sequence types (3 from the soil samples and 1 from the 2 clippers),
with no matches to the clinical _B. cereus_ sequence type.
The response rate for the cohort study was 73 percent (483/660); the
response rate for freshmen was 84 percent (248/292). Of the respondents,
423 (88 percent) were male, and 248 (51 percent) were freshmen, which was
representative of the entire cohort. The median age was 19 years, and 405
(84 percent) cadets were white. After adjusting for sex, freshman class
status, and participation in orientation week, the multivariate logistic
regression model indicated a statistically significant association between
having scalp lesions and receiving a haircut (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] =
10.6; 95 percent confidence internal [CI] = 2.3-49.3, p less than 0.01),
membership in Company B (AOR = 9.7; CI = 3.4-27.8, p less than 0.01), and
sharing sunscreen (AOR = 2.7; CI = 1.3-5.4, p less than 0.01). Other risk
factors examined included demographic information, exposure to soil and
water, and hygiene practices (e.g., laundry, bathing, and use of shared
products).

Editorial Note
--------------
_Bacillus cereus_ is a recognized bacterial pathogen in humans.
Non-gastrointestinal infections are usually the result of a breakdown in
natural protective barriers such as the skin or immune system (1, 2, 5).
The findings in this report indicate that immunocompetent persons can be
vulnerable to cutaneous _B. cereus_ infections when skin is compromised.
Isolation of 3 indistinguishable _B. cereus_ isolates from 3 patients on 2
separate days suggested that this was a common-source outbreak and not a
laboratory contaminant, even though the environmental source of _B. cereus_
was not identified during the investigation. All but 5 cases were diagnosed
on 2 concurrent days, making person-to-person transmission unlikely.
Transmission most likely occurred from an exposure at the beginning of the
orientation week. The short haircut likely caused microabrasions,
compromising the protective effect of scalp epidermis. Exposure to mud,
sun, and sunscreen further provided an environment suitable for bacterial
growth.
The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. First,
only 3 clinical samples were available for culture. Because of the number
of cases and the positive response to therapy, the health-center staff
treated cases empirically before GDPH involvement. Second, other risk
factors and potential confounders might not have been identified during the
site visits. Finally, cadets were asked about their orientation exposures
nearly 3 weeks after the events occurred; recall bias might have influenced
the findings.
As a result of this investigation, GDPH made recommendations to the
university military program for future orientations to minimize the risk
for another outbreak. These included 1) changing the type of haircut
required for male cadets that would allow for more hair and less injury to
the scalp, 2) allowing adequate time for personal hygiene, and
3) distributing individual packets of sunscreen and discouraging sharing
of sunscreen. These recommendations were implemented during the 2005
orientation activities; no skin infections were reported. University
military programs should establish infection-control practices including
good hygiene as part of their organized orientation events.

[ProMED thanks Ivan Oransky from The Scientist for his contribution of this
quite unusual cluster. Since many laboratories may not identify _B.
cereus_ from a skin culture and refer to it as _Bacillus_ species -- which
may well be thought of as a contaminant from a typical
staphylococcal-streptococcal impetigo -- sporadic cases may indeed occur.
Reference 7 above describes a 29-year-old with a chronic (2-month) leg
ulceration that initially developed during a 3-month stay in French
Polynesia and developed into a superficial ulceration with dark, adherent
eschar and surrounding erythematous halo. The culture was obtained from a
biopsy instead of a swab and revealed a pure culture of _B. cereus_. - Mod.LL]
