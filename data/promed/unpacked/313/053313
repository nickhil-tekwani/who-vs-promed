Re the moderator-comments on the latest 2 postings on botulism. They
are very useful and competent, but are missing out 3 important
points; all lessons I learned from the case we had in 2003 in my
food-inspection area (see ProMED posti 20030131.0267).
1. Garlic (and chili) in oil dressing is a known source of _C. botulinum_.
2. Atypical presentation of symptoms occurs with unilateral paresis
and rapid recovery.
3. Botulism may pass undiagnosed in patients with a mild course of
the disease or in patients with atypical symptoms.
All 3 points may be specifically related to _C. botulinum_ type B as
other case stories support. See related articles (summaries) below.
I am a food microbiologist, not a medical doctor, but I was taught at
university that botulism never goes undiagnosed, because it is so
severe in its symptoms and often fatal. This may not always be true.
I learned that it takes a very skilled doctor to diagnose a case of
botulism type B.

from chopped garlic: delayed recognition of a major outbreak. Ann
Intern Med 1988 Mar;108(3):363-8 Enteric Diseases Branch, Centers for
Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia.
Abstract:
Diagnosis of botulism in 2 teenaged sisters in Montreal led to the
identification of 36 previously unrecognized cases of type B botulism
in persons who had eaten at a restaurant in Vancouver, British
Columbia, during the preceding 6 weeks. A case-control study
implicated a new vehicle for botulism, commercial chopped garlic in
soybean oil (P less than 10(-4)). Relatively mild and slowly
progressive illness, dispersion of patients over at least 8 provinces
and states in 3 countries, and a previously unsuspected vehicle had
contributed to prolonged misdiagnoses, including myasthenia gravis (6
patients), psychiatric disorders (4), stroke (3), and others. Ethnic
background influenced severity of illness: 60 percent of Chinese
patients but only 4 percent of others needed mechanical ventilation
(P less than 10(-3]. Trypsinization of serum was needed to show
toxemia in one patient. Electromyography results with high-frequency
repetitive stimulation corroborated the diagnosis of botulism up to 2
months after onset. Although botulism is a life-threatening disease,
misdiagnosis may be common and large outbreaks can escape recognition
completely.

Garlic-in-oil associated botulism: episode leads to product
modification.Am J Public Health 1990 Nov;80(11):1372-3. Bureau of
Communicable Disease Control, New York State Department of Health and
State University, Albany.
Abstract:
In February 1989, 3 cases of botulism occurred in persons who
consumed garlic bread made from a garlic-in-oil product. Testing of
leftover garlic-in-oil showed it to have a pH of 5.7 and to contain
high concentrations of _Clostridium botulinum_ organisms and toxin.
This was the 2nd episode of botulism associated with a low acid
garlic-in-oil product which needs constant refrigeration. In
response, the Food and Drug Administration has taken steps to prevent
a recurrence by requiring that microbial inhibitors or acidifying
agents be added to such products.

I have been in touch with the Chair of our botulism lab
here. Apparently the information from the FDA website needs to be
updated. We have been discussing possible cases of adult colonization
botulism, which fits into that undetermined category. The
undetermined category no longer exists. It should be referred to as
adult colonization botulism. In some cases, both infant and adult
colonization botulism have been grouped together as colonization botulism.
