Ebola virus disease update -- West Africa
-----------------------------------------
Between 10-11 Aug 2014, a total of 128 new cases of Ebola virus disease (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) as well as 56 deaths were reported from Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.

Contact tracing in Guinea, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone has resulted in a range between 94 percent and 98 percent of contacts of EVD cases being identified and followed-up. In Liberia, efforts are underway to strengthen contact tracing, but help is needed in this area. The Liberian Army has also recently placed a 3rd province under quarantine as part of the ongoing effort to stop transmission of EVD.

On 11 Aug 2014, WHO convened a panel of medical ethicists, scientific experts, and lay people from the affected countries to consider and assess the ethical implications for clinical decision-making of the potential use of unregistered interventions. [A report of the meeting was posted on ProMED-mail archive no 20140812.2682604. - Mod.JW]

On the operational side, WHO is finalizing its strategic operations response plan and expects to share this with countries and partners in the coming days. Mapping is also underway to develop an operational picture in order to coordinate and move people and materials to areas of greatest need.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD. (Contacts do not include properly-protected health-care workers and laboratory staff.) Temporary recommendations from the Emergency Committee with regard to actions to be taken by countries can be found at http://who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2014/ebola-20140808/en.

[A table showing confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, as of 11 Aug 2014, shows totals of 1975 cases and 1069 deaths.]

The total number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and availability of laboratory results. Data reported in the Disease Outbreak News are based on official information reported by Ministries of Health.

Ebola virus disease, Sierra Leone
---------------------------------
As of today, 13 Aug 2014, we have a total of 191 patients who have survived Ebola virus disease and subsequently been discharged. The total number of new confirmed cases is 11: Kenema 9 and Port Loko 2.

The total number of cumulative number of deaths is 264 and cumulative number of confirmed cases is 717 with Kailahun 378, Kenema 259; Kono 1; Kambia 1; Bombali 7; Tonkolili 2; Port Loko 24; Pujehun 3; Bo 22; Moyamba 5; Bonthe 1; Western Area Urban [Freetown] 13; Western Area Rural 1. As of today, Koinadugu district is the only district that has not registered confirmed cases of EVD in Sierra Leone.

The cumulative number of probable cases is 37 and probable deaths 34 while the total cumulative number of suspected cases is 46 and suspected deaths is 5.

The Presidential Task Force chaired by His Excellency the President, Dr Ernest Bai Koroma has been expanded to include Development Partners, Political Parties; the Sierra Leone Bar Association; House of Parliament; and Civil Societies. The Presidential Task Force met today [13 Aug 2014] at the State House where the President reminded the partners about the funding gap in the National Strategic Response plans and urged all partners to meet their commitments made to speed up the implementation of the Response plan.

The Emergency Operation Center (EOC) has rolled out a strategy to strengthen the EOCs at national and district level. To this end, the composition of the EOC at national level has been reconstituted and downsized for effective national coordination, decision making, and leadership. Accordingly, the EOCs at district levels have also been strengthened with the deployment of senior officials from the Ministry of Health and Sanitation head office to be based in specific districts to coordinate and provide support to the district EOCs.

The EOC also decided that the Deputy Minister of Health and Sanitation 1 Dr Abu Bakar Fofanah be deployed to Kenema to help strengthen the coordination of EOC operations. In addition, 2 senior Directors have also been deployed to Port Loko and Bo districts to exercise similar functions.

Ref: Baize S, Pannetier D, Oestereich L, et al: Emergence of Zaire Ebola Virus Disease in Guinea -- Preliminary Report. N Engl J Med. 2014. [Epub ahead of print]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
In March 2014, the World Health Organization was notified of an outbreak of a communicable disease characterized by fever, severe diarrhea, vomiting, and a high fatality rate in Guinea. Virologic investigation identified Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) as the causative agent. Full-length genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that EBOV from Guinea forms a separate clade in relationship to the known EBOV strains from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Gabon. Epidemiologic investigation linked the laboratory-confirmed cases with the presumed 1st fatality of the outbreak in December 2013. This study demonstrates the emergence of a new EBOV strain in Guinea.

[The full article is available at the source URL above.

[9 Aug 2014: scientists investigating the source of the outbreak believe that the latest outbreak can be traced back to a 2-year-old boy in a village in Gueckedou, in southeastern Guinea, who died on 6 Dec 2013 a few days after he fell ill with a fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. From there, the disease reportedly spread to kill the child's mother, 3-year-old sister, and grandmother, before transferring to a health care worker from Gueckedou. The team of epidemiologists traced the disease by "reviewing hospital documentations and interviews with affected families, patients with suspected disease, and inhabitants of villages in which cases occurred."

Ebola outbreak: Kenya at high risk, warns WHO
---------------------------------------------
WHO has classified Kenya as a "high-risk" country for the spread of the deadly ebolavirus. Kenya is vulnerable because it is a major transport hub, with many flights from West Africa, a WHO official said. This is the most serious warning to date by the WHO that EVD could spread to East Africa.

The WHO's country director for Kenya, Custodia Mandlhate, said the East African state was "classified in group 2; at high risk of transmission." Health checks at the main airport in the capital, Nairobi, have been stepped up in recent weeks. The Kenyan government said it would not ban flights from the 4 countries hit by EVD... Kenya receives more than 70 flights a week from West Africa.

Why Patrick Sawyer travelled to Nigeria -- wife
-----------------------------------------------
The widow of the late Patrick Sawyer, the Liberian who brought Ebola virus disease into Nigeria, has defended her husband's decision to travel to Africa's most populous country, saying he did so in desperate search for a country with better healthcare system than his own [Liberia]... Mr Sawyer had no trust in the healthcare system in Liberia and had possibly headed to Nigeria with the hope of receiving better treatment for his ailment. Mrs Sawyer shared her thoughts on her Facebook profile ... [more]

Nigeria
-------
The West African regional body, ECOWAS, said one of its officials, JAA, had died of EVD in Nigeria. The 36-year-old had been in contact with Patrick Sawyer, the Liberian government employee who was the 1st to be killed by the virus in Nigeria on 25 Jul 2014, ECOWAS said in a statement. Mr Sawyer had flown in from Liberia, when he was diagnosed with EVD after collapsing at the airport in Lagos, the biggest city in sub-Saharan Africa. http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28769678

The nurse who died after contracting Ebola virus disease from index case -- Liberian Patrick Sawyer -- refused to heed a warning against travel and has caused the quarantine of 21 persons in Enugu. Labaran Maku, Nigeria's Information Minister, stated that 10 out of the 198 persons identified as primary and secondary contacts with the late Liberian carrier, Patrick Sawyer, have tested positive to the virus. Of the 198 persons under surveillance, 177 of them are in Lagos while 21 are in Enugu... The family of the late nurse and others who had direct contact with her are being quarantined in other stations across the state. "All those who had primary contact have been quarantined. Secondary contacts have also been traced. So far the number of people that have been traced is 198. Out of this number, 177 are in Lagos. Some are in quarantine, some are being monitored by health specialists. All those with whom the nurse was in contact, including her husband, are under quarantine. The medical team has been able to trace all those who made contact with her," Mr Maku said... [more]

Shipping line precautions
-----------------------
Maersk Line suspends shore-leave in Ebola-hit countries. Maersk Line will not stop calling at West African ports stricken by the Ebola virus disease [EVD], but the company will suspend shore-leave -- which is the leave that professional sailors get to spend on dry land -- as well as make some changes to crews in Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, Lloyd's Loading List reports. The decision coincides with the World Health Organisation (WHO) declaring the outbreak a "Public Health Emergency of International Concern" (PHEIC), affecting trade and travel. The global shipping organisations voiced their concern as well over the outbreak of EVD and its affect on shipping industry. They also issued guidelines on the risks posed to ships' crews calling in countries affected by EVD.

Korea
-----
Kwon Joon-wook of the Ministry of Health and Welfare said during an EVD forum hosted by the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul, "If any Koreans living in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, or Nigeria test positive for EVD and wish to be treated in Korea, there may be resistance from the public, but the government will make utmost efforts to have them treated here." The government has already prepared quarantine facilities in 17 hospitals around the country to treat EVD patients, but no preparations have been made for transporting them back to Korea.
