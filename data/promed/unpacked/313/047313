The sailors who suffered on the ship "Roksolana" are going to sue the
owner of the ship. Their interests will be represented by the Kerch
Union of trade and fishing sailors.

According to the representative of the Union, the situation on
"Roksolana" is a repetition of the story on "Odysk". Moreover, the
ship has the same structure as the "Odysk", and in both ships the
illuminators [windows] of the crewmembers open to the corridor and
not to the outside.

The preliminary information is that the gas came from the cargo section.

The sailors asked the Union to represent them as they consider that
the contract they signed does not provide fair compensation.

Let's remember that after the previous incident with the ship "Odysk",
the sailors received USD 10 000 each and the families of the deceased
received USD 50 000, twice the amount stated in the contracts.

According to "Noviy Region" the ship "Roksolana" sailed under the
flag of Belize with 11 crewmembers on board and carrying 1641 tons of
grain. On the morning of 16 Mar 2008, the captain of the ship asked
for help after he found a dead sailor and 4 others poisoned. After
the evacuation of the crew, the members of the group for radiation
and chemical protection took samples of the air from the ship's
interior. The concentration of poisonous agents in the air was 200
times higher than the safety limit. The specialists stated that it
was poisoning with phosphine. The ship had been treated with
[fumigating agents] against insects and rats. It is the 3rd case of
the same kind on the Crimean coast.

[The reported case is the 3rd after a planned treatment of the ships
with fumigating agents. This kind of work needs careful safety
procedures and proper instruction. The ship owners have to provide
special protective outerwear and respiratory equipment for
anti-rodent treatment. - Corr.VM

Phosphine gas is frequently used in the grain industry for fumigating
grain, especially grains that are held for any period of time. The
fumigation decreases weevils and rodents preying on the grain.

Phosphine gas is a colorless, inflammable gas with carbide or
fish-like odor and some describe it as a garlic-like odor. It is most
frequently toxic by inhalation. The amount that is toxic is relative
to the species inhaling it. The amount per cubic meter and the length
of time of exposure govern the toxicity. The higher the amount means
the lower the time necessary to cause toxicity and conversely, the
lower the amount per cubic meter the longer the time of exposure
required to produce intoxication. The levels are not cumulative.

Phosphine is most often sold in the form of aluminium phosphide,
calcium phosphide, or zinc phosphide pellets. Phosphine is released
when it encounters moisture, such as atmospheric moisture or gastric
acid in the stomach of rodents.

If the crew believed there were fish on board then they may not have
thought a fishy odor to be odd. However, with the grain off-gassing
in the ship's hold and no outside ventilation for the crew, this was
a set up for a deadly situation.

Phosphine is a very toxic gas, and is also generated as a by-product
during the manufacturing of methamphetamine. - Mod.TG]
