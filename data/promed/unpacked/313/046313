Methanol poisoning - Estonia 20010912.2199

Referring to the posted methanol poisoning in Estonia.
------------------------------------------------
In my opinion it would be appropriate to stress the following:
When alcohol (ethanol) products contain methanol at a level that can cause
poisoning, it is always the result of deliberate fraud - i.e., methanol has
been added to the alcohol. Although the fermentation of raw materials
containing pectine (highest levels in prunes or berries) will result in
formation of methanol, the levels are low and should cause no concern; as
in alcohol products, the cure (ethanol) is ingested with the poison
(methanol).
Enzymatic degradation of vegetable products to be used as juices is an
entirely different matter. In this case control of methanol levels is needed.
