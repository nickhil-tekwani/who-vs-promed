Avian influenza situation in Indonesia -- WHO update
----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has notified WHO of a new case of a human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus. The case is an 8 year old girl from the province of West Java. She developed fever on 18 June 2012 and then travelled on vacation the following day to Singapore, where she saw a private physician who diagnosed pharyngitis on 20 June. The case returned to Jakarta on 24 June and was still feeling unwell with coughing, decreased appetite, and vomiting. Her family took her for treatment to the local hospital. Her condition deteriorated and she was transferred to intensive care, but died on 3 July. Infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus was confirmed by the National Institute of Health Research and Development (NIHRD), Ministry of Health.

Epidemiological investigation has been conducted in the case's neighborhood and nearby market, which revealed that the case had contact with poultry when she went to a market with her father to buy live chickens. She was present when the chicken was culled in the designated part of the market.

The Ministry of Health in Singapore has been informed about the case under the International Health Regulations.

To date, the total number of human influenza A(H5N1) cases in Indonesia is now 190 with 158 fatalities.

Indonesian girl who travelled to Singapore dies of avian flu
------------------------------------------------------------
SINGAPORE: The Health Ministry says it has been informed of a case of avian influenza A (H5N1) [virus infection] in an 8 year old girl from Indonesia who had travelled to Singapore. In a statement, the ministry said the girl developed fever in Singapore on 18 Jun 2012 and returned to Indonesia on 24 Jun 2012. She died on 3 Jul 2012.

The ministry said human cases of avian influenza A have been reported in a number of countries, including Indonesia, from time to time since 2004. To date, the efficient spread of H5N1 from person to person has not been reported. And the Health Ministry has not been notified of any local cases of H5N1. Singapore's Health Ministry is in close contact with the Indonesian health authorities and WHO.

The Indonesian health authorities have reported that the girl had exposure to poultry while in Indonesia, a few days before her travel to Singapore. They are monitoring her close contacts, including family members. All contacts have remained well. As a precautionary measure, Singapore's Health Ministry has alerted hospitals to the case and commenced contact tracing in Singapore. The girl stayed at a hotel in Singapore with her mother and other relatives from 19 to 24 Jun 2012 on a vacation. She was brought to see a general practitioner for high fever on 22 Jun 2012 and was given treatment. Her relative who lives here and the general practitioner who treated the case are both well.

[This case becomes the 190th in Indonesia since the onset of the outbreak in 2005 and the 158th fatality. Like the majority of previous cases of avian A/(H5N1) virus infection in Indonesia and elsewhere, only a solitary individual has become infected in each incident, and none of the affected individual's relatives or contacts. Consequently the expectation is that there will be no onward transmission of avian influenza A/H5N1 virus infection to any of the deceased girl's contacts during her stay in in Singapore.
