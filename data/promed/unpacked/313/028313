[The patient] from Tel Aviv, who is in the 27th week of her 2nd pregnancy, already knows what is allowed and what is not allowed for pregnant women and what food should be avoided so as not to harm the fetus. Three weeks ago, she decided to order a delivery for her and her family, including several dishes from the Fu Sushi restaurant in central Tel Aviv.

[The patient] took care to find out in advance that the dishes for pregnant women are prepared in a special strip [?] in a restaurant that is completely and sterile separated from the other stripes [?], thus the restaurant takes care of special dishes for its pregnant customers as various restaurants in the city take care to do.

Pregnant women usually avoid eating nice [raw?] fish because they may contain the _Listeria_ bacterium that is dangerous to the fetus, so they prefer to eat cooked fish and, in places where there is a separation between the nice [raw?] foods and the cooked ones, to make sure bacteria do not get into the food. Foods that may contain _Listeria_ bacteria include sausages and raw meat, chicken, unpasteurized milk, ice cream, vegetables or live fruits, raw or smoked fish.

[The patient] claimed that on the restaurant's delivery website, it was explicitly stated that there is a separate strip [?] for pregnant women in the restaurant and that it can only be ordered by phone. And so she did. [The patient] called twice and made sure the sushi dishes she ordered, which are suitable for pregnant women, would be prepared in a separate pregnancy strip [?] as promised at the restaurant.

But to her surprise, a few hours after they finished eating, [the patient] and her family began to feel unwell and realized they were suffering from a stomach upset. The only one who felt okay was [the patient]'s husband, who did not eat from the dishes they ordered. Stomach upset lasted for several days until [the patient] had to go to the hospital for tests. Since she did not have a fever, she was released to the HMO for further tests. At that time, she applied to the Ministry of Health for an inspection at the restaurant. The Ministry of Health reported that "an on-site inspection was carried out, samples were taken, and a warning call was even made to the restaurant owners. In deciphering [?] one of the samples, _Listeria_ bacteria were discovered, and therefore a procedure was used to treat _Listeria_."

[The patient] said that a representative of the restaurant called and claimed that it had never been written that there was a "pregnancy stripe [?] in the restaurant," but they would now also emphasize this on their website. "The representative's claim is completely untrue," [the patient] replied in a conversation with N12. "Beyond that, no one should eat food with bacteria and _Listeria_, not just pregnancies that it endangers their fetus more."

Yesterday [2 Feb 2022], after receiving the test results from the Ministry of Health, [the patient] began recommending [?] antibiotics to her doctors. "I feel good now, but the doctors cannot rule out _Listeria_ one hundred percent," she wrote in a Facebook post; "As long as I do not develop more 'suspicious' symptoms, I will not be treated for _Listeria_, so I will have to wait until the birth with some apprehension." [The patient] also mentioned in her post the case of a friend of hers who ate at a restaurant at another time, and she, too, had to receive antibiotic treatment after a suspicion of a _Listeria_ infection. "When a prestigious and reputed restaurant boasts a 'sterile stripe [?] for pregnancies,' I would not point an accusing finger at anyone who chooses to believe. Pregnant [?]."

_Listeria_ is a name of a bacterium that is found mainly in foods such as uncooked fish, explained Prof. Tal Biron-Chantal, director of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Meir Medical Center of Clalit Group. "When the infection [occurs] in pregnant women, there is a risk to the fetus. Epidemiological studies indicate an increased risk of intrauterine mortality of fetuses to mothers who have had a _Listeria_ [infection] in pregnancy. This is why we are afraid of this infection in pregnancy and recommend avoiding foods that contain uncooked fish. Also, if there is a clinical suspicion of infection, we give antibiotic treatment to reduce the risk of related complications."

From Fu Sushi Restaurant: "Fu Sushi's kitchen works according to all the strictest procedures of the Ministry of Health and is accompanied [?] by a private food safety company. _Listeria_ is a bacterium that can incubate 7 days before it develops. [The incubation period, which is the time between consumption of contaminated food and the onset of symptoms, can be up to 70 days. - Mod.ML] We work with fresh fish on a daily basis and therefore believe the bacterium is not in our kitchen. We have transferred the supplier's details to the Ministry of Health for further investigation and treatment and we are doing everything possible to serve food at the highest level of cleanliness and safety."

The Ministry of Health responded: "The said case occurred more than a week ago when a complaint of food poisoning was received. One pregnant woman went to the emergency room, was treated and released in good condition. Also, an HMO infectionologist [infectious diseases physician] provided general instructions for her. There is no concern for the patient or fetus."

_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely distributed in nature. The organism is a Gram-positive bacillus that can be found in soil, water, silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw (unpasteurized) milk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises used to process contaminated meat or fish and vegetables, and in the intestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, humans, crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects. Most human infections are foodborne, although vertical transmission can occur from mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery through an infected birth canal, and localized skin infections can occur in veterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected animals.

Contamination of food can occur in nature (e.g., raw vegetables contaminated by soil and manure, and raw milk and cheese made from raw milk by infected cows), or contamination can occur after cooking or other processing.

Even if the initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can become significant for refrigerated foods because _L. monocytogenes_ can multiply at refrigerator temperatures to a sufficient number to cause disease when the food is ingested. Thus, it is not surprising that listeriosis is usually associated with ingestion of contaminated raw milk and cheese made from raw milk, as well as ready-to-eat (RTE) meat or vegetable products that have been held at refrigeration temperatures. _Listeria_ can also survive in frozen food. Consumption of raw milk, raw-milk soft cheeses (e.g., brie, camembert, and Mexican soft cheeses), coleslaw, raw vegetables in salads, pate, deli cold cut meats, hotdogs, and raw or undercooked seafood, e.g., smoked or cured salmon, oysters, or sushi (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/10/201007123057.htm) have been sources of human listeriosis.

The sources of human infection can be pinpointed by molecular techniques, i.e., matching genotypes of _Listeria_ isolated from patients with genotypes of _Listeria_ isolated from a possible source.

People aged 65 years or older and those with an impaired immune system are at increased risk for listeriosis. Due to pregnancy-related immunosuppression, pregnant women are 10 or more times more likely to get listeriosis than the general population (https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2014/12/management-of-pregnant-women-with-presumptive-exposure-to-listeria-monocytogenes). However, many pregnant women may have no symptoms or only mild illness, with fever, myalgia, backache, and headache, often accompanied by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. Nevertheless, fetal and neonatal infection can be severe and potentially fatal. The pregnancy may terminate in miscarriage, stillbirth, or preterm labor, and the infection in the neonate can result in sepsis or meningitis.

People at increased risk for disseminated listeriosis, which include pregnant women, should avoid eating food potentially contaminated with _Listeria_. Proper food handling, in particular separating uncooked meats or fish from other items during preparation and washing hands, utensils, and cutting boards after handling uncooked foods, is critical. Adequate treatment of an exposed pregnant woman with fever and signs and symptoms consistent with listeriosis for whom no other cause of illness is known should be tested and treated for presumptive listeriosis; no testing, including blood and stool cultures, or treatment is indicated for an asymptomatic pregnant woman who reports consumption of a product that was recalled or implicated during an outbreak of _Listeria_ contamination, according to guidance from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2014/12/management-of-pregnant-women-with-presumptive-exposure-to-listeria-monocytogenes). The article goes on to say: "A pregnant woman who ate a product that was recalled because of _Listeria_ contamination and who is afebrile but has signs and symptoms consistent with a minor gastrointestinal or flu-like illness can be managed expectantly."

Ampicillin, alone or in combination with gentamicin, is the 1st line of treatment; trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is an alternative but should be avoided in the 1st trimester of pregnancy because of its antifolate effect, associated with neural tube defects (https://www.cdc.gov/pregnancy/meds/treatingfortwo/features/kf-uti-antibiotic-treatments-pregnant-women.html). - Mod.ML
