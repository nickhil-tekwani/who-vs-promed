[The 52 new confirmed and 1801 suspected cases (up from 52 confirmed and 1374 suspected cases in the previous report) indicate that Lassa fever virus transmission is continuing, as Nigeria is now well within the period of the year when more cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 3. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 - 11 over the past 3 years and probably will be the case again this year (2019). There are 114 confirmed deaths, up from 93 in the previous reporting period. Unfortunately, one new healthcare worker was infected during this reporting period, and the total infected healthcare workers is 16. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, with confirmed cases occurring in 21 states, and the number of affected LGAs has increased from 66 2 previous reporting periods ago to 73 at week 11.

Transmission of Lassa virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. - Mod.TY
