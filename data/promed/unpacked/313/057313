At least 40 demoiselle cranes were found dead near Victor Dam near Rajula in Amreli district, rattling wildlife activists and forest officials.

Preliminary investigation suggested that the migratory birds died due to breathing problem, but experts are not ruling out the possibility of the cranes dying due to bird flu. Officials said that post-mortem revealed that birds had died of breathing disorder.

[Clinical signs of highly pathogenic avian influenza vary from sudden death to highly variable clinical presentations, based on species, age, type of bird, viral strain, concurrent infections, and environment. Respiratory signs may occur; ocular and nasal discharges, coughing, snicking, dyspnoea, swelling of the sinuses and/or head. Among the respiratory lesions that may be found are excessive mucous exudate in the lumen of the trachea, or severe haemorrhagic tracheitis.
