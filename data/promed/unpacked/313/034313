-----------------------------------------------------
Highlights
- Seroconverters to yellow fever (YF) vaccine in reduced doses remained seropositive 8 years later.
- This applies equally well to doses from 27 476 IU down to 31 IU.
- This study supports the minimum dose required by WHO, 1000 IU.
- This information is crucial when use of fractional YF vaccine is considered.

Abstract
In 2009, Bio-Manguinhos conducted a dose-response study with the yellow fever vaccine, administering the vaccine in the usual mean dose of 27 476 IU (full dose, reference) and in tapered doses (10 447 IU, 3013 IU, 587 IU, 158 IU, and 31 IU) by the usual subcutaneous route and usual volume (0.5 mL). Tapered doses were obtained by dilution in the manufacturer's laboratory, and the test batches presented industrial quality. Doses down to 587 IU showed similar immunogenicity to the full dose (2 476, reference), while the 158 IU and 31 IU doses displayed lower immunogenicity. Seropositivity was maintained at 10 months, except in the group that received the 31 IU dose. The current study aims to determine whether yellow fever seropositivity was maintained 8 years after YF vaccination in non-revaccinated individuals. According to the current study's results, seropositivity was maintained in 85 percent of 318 participants and was similar across groups. The findings support the use of the yellow fever vaccine in fractional doses during outbreaks, but each fractional dose should have at least 587 IU. This study also supports the minimum dose required by WHO, 1000 IU.

Background
The objective of this study was to evaluate the duration of immunity 8 years after administration of reduced doses of the 17DD YF vaccine in the 2009 dose-response study by measuring neutralizing antibody levels, with a view towards supporting the use of fractionated doses.

Conclusions
- At least 80 percent of the subjects who had seroconverted after yellow fever vaccination with doses from 27 476 IU down to 31 IU showed seropositivity comparable to that of the full dose after 8 years. Consistently, antibody titers in the reduced-dose groups were also comparable to those of the full-dose group. However, the lowest doses (158 IU and 31 IU) had more primary seroconversion failures, so they should still be considered inferior to the full-dose vaccine.
- Groups of decreasing doses from the dose-response study in 2009 showed YF seropositivity rates ranging from 80-95.7 percent 8 years later. All the rates were acceptable and comparable to other studies on duration of immunity in adults receiving the full dose.
- Geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers [GMT] to yellow fever were similar across groups, except for the 31 IU group, in which the GMT was higher. All groups had the lower limit of the 95 percent confidence interval [CI] above the cut-off for seropositivity.
- To the extent that protection can be inferred from these immunological parameters, the current study supports the use of yellow fever vaccine in fractionated doses and the minimum dose recommended by WHO, 1000 IU.

[The question has been this: Would a reduced (fractionated) dose of the yellow fever vaccine elicit long-term immunity? In the face of major yellow fever outbreaks in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Brazil, the supply of vaccine was not adequate to provide coverage for the populations at risk. To meet the vaccine needs in Angola and then in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization reviewed existing evidence that demonstrates that using 1/5th of a standard vaccine dose would still provide protection against the disease for at least 12 months and possibly longer. This approach, known as fractional dosing, was under consideration as a short-term measure, in the context of a potential vaccine shortage in emergencies. In the case of the Brazil outbreak, the Ministry of Health initiated a major vaccination campaign to prevent additional human cases. In order to have sufficient vaccine to provide the coverage of the population at risk, in the period from [Thu 25 Jan-Sun 15 Apr 2018], individuals in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo received the fractionated dose of the yellow fever vaccine. The above study indicates that reduced doses can provide immunity. The virus is live and attenuated. If the vaccine virus replicates sufficiently, one would expect an immune response with residual memory providing long-term protection. Although challenge experiments over time are not possible (or ethical), the antibody responses indicated that immunity does persist for at least 8 years. This information will be extremely valuable for decision-making in the face of another yellow fever outbreak. The virus is not going to disappear in Africa nor in South America. - Mod.TY
