Acute hepatitis E - Burkina Faso
--------------------------------
Between 8 Sep 2020 and 24 Nov 2020, the North-Central region of Burkina Faso reported a cumulative total of 442 cases of febrile jaundice. The vast majority of cases (87.5%) were reported from Barsalogho health district with 387 cases and 16 deaths, representing a case-fatality rate of 4.1% (see Figures 1 and 2 [for figures, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]). A total of 15 out of 16 deaths were reported in pregnant or postpartum women.

A total of 10 cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as hepatitis E. Currently 38 patients are being followed up at the Barsalogho medical center, 10 of which are in hospital. Case descriptions according to individual characteristics show that 67% of cases were less than 30 years old (mean age is 25 +/- 12 years); 54% of febrile jaundice cases were female; and nearly 5% of cases were less than 5 years old.

As early as 11 Sep 2020, WHO advised the Ministry of Health that the cause could be hepatitis E given the following contexts:

- 14 samples were collected and sent to the National Reference Laboratory for Viral Hemorrhagic Fever [NRL-VHF]; one sample came back positive for yellow fever positive by IgM (collected during the survey) (1st batch). The sample was then sent to Dakar for additional yellow fever and differential testing.

- 9 samples (out of the 14 collected during the survey) were sent to Lapeyronie Hospital, Montpellier, France for hepatitis E testing: 8 of the 9 samples were IgM positive for hepatitis E (results shared on 25 Sep 2020). Genotyping of 8 samples for viral hepatitis E showed that the virus was genotype 2; therefore, no zoonotic infection was detected.

- A 2nd batch of 43 samples was sent for testing to the [NRL-VHF] (Muraz Center, Bobo Dioulasso) resulting in 2 IgM positive cases for yellow fever by IgM and one undetermined.

- The 2 probable and one indeterminate sample from the 2nd batch along with the one probable sample from the 1st batch (total 4 samples) were sent on 30 Sep 2020 to the Pasteur Institute of Dakar (IP Dakar) for additional yellow fever and differential tests. Two of the 4 samples tested positive for hepatitis E by PCR; none tested positive for yellow fever by PCR (results shared on 20 Oct 2020). These same 4 samples were then tested and came back positive for yellow fever by serum neutralization, but with low titers (results shared on 26 Oct 2020) and are therefore not interpreted as acute yellow fever infection in this context.

- To date, a total of 349 samples (out of 387 suspect cases) have been collected, of which 163 have been analyzed at the [NRL-VHF] for yellow fever.

There are many internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the region, most of them with host families and some living in camps. In addition, the North-Central region is affected by the closure of health facilities due to insecurity resulting from regular attacks by Unidentified Armed Men (HANI). In the Health District of Barsalogho, 3 out of 4 communes are heavily affected by these attacks resulting in displacement of the population. A total of 40% of the country's IDPs are registered in the North-Central region, but only 6 out of 15 health facilities are in operation. Burkina Faso is affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, and as of 23 Nov 2020, 2757 cases and 68 deaths have been reported. The context of the COVID-19 pandemic further complicates the response.

WHO advice
----------
Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). Hepatitis E is found worldwide and is common in countries with limited access to essential water, sanitation, hygiene, and health services, or in areas of humanitarian emergencies.

The hepatitis E virus is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, mainly through contaminated water. The risk factors for hepatitis E are related to poor sanitation conditions, allowing the viruses excreted in the feces of infected subjects to reach water intended for human consumption. In general, the infection heals spontaneously in 2-6 weeks with a lethality of 0.5-4%. Fulminant hepatitis is more common when hepatitis E occurs during pregnancy. Pregnant women, especially in their 2nd and 3rd trimester, are at increased risk of acute liver failure, fetal loss, and mortality. The case-fatality rate can be as high as 20-25% in women in the last trimester of pregnancy.

Prevention is the most effective approach against this disease. At the population level, the most important interventions to reduce the transmission of HEV and the number of hepatitis E cases are provision of safe drinking water, quality standards for public water supplies, and the provision of adequate sanitation. At the individual level, infectious risks can be reduced by maintaining hygienic practices such as washing hands with clean water and soap -- especially before handling food, avoiding consumption of water and/or ice of unknown purity, and following WHO hygiene practices for food safety.

To prevent the spread of acute hepatitis E, WHO recommends improving access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. The quality of drinking water should be regularly monitored in neighborhoods affected by this epidemic. Coverage of latrines and drinking water sources should be increased to prevent open defecation and to ensure hand hygiene. Health promotion and prevention activities, as well as ensuring early, appropriate, and equitable healthcare services to combat hepatitis E epidemics, can help improve public health outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings. Since the incubation period for hepatitis E ranges from 2 to 10 weeks, cases may continue to occur up to the 10th week (maximum incubation period) even after measures to ensure safe water, sanitation and hygiene promotion have been adopted.

The intervention must continue to target vulnerable populations by establishing or strengthening antenatal diagnosis for pregnant women with symptoms, improving the population's hygiene conditions, strengthening national capacities for diagnosis and clinical case management, and cross-border collaboration with neighboring countries.

To date, a hepatitis E vaccine has been developed for commercialization and licensed in China and Pakistan. While WHO does not recommend the introduction of the vaccine as part of national routine population immunization programs, WHO recommends that national authorities may decide to use the vaccine in outbreak settings, including in populations at high risk, such as pregnant women. Vaccine use should therefore be considered to mitigate or prevent an outbreak of hepatitis E, as well as to reduce the effects of an outbreak in high-risk individuals, such as pregnant women.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology, including genotypes that are zoonotic. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, whereas zoonotic genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Acute epidemic hepatitis E is attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. - Mod.LL
