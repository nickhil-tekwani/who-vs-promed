Ecuador: Dengue/DHF outbreak risk increased by prolonged rain and flooding
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUITO: Heavy rains have driven more than 3000 Ecuadorians from their homes
as rivers overflow their banks, taking with them bridges, retaining walls
and destroying thousands of hectares of crops, authorities said on Thu 14
Mar 2002. The national emergency system has been activated to help manage
the fleeing farmers, the country's interior minister said, though entire
communities remain shut off from centralized services. No new deaths have
been reported, and health minister Patricio Jamriska stopped short of
declaring a health emergency for the moment despite the likelihood of
outbreaks of dengue fever and malaria.
Already, 68 cases of dengue fever have been reported as well as 2 cases of
the more dangerous hemorrhagic variety. Ecuador canceled delivery of 70 000
tons of rice to neighboring Colombia after 3400 hectares (1373 acres) were
destroyed in the downpour, jeopardizing domestic stocks.
The heavy rains began in February and have swept across seven of Ecuador's
22 provinces.

Malaysia: dengue/DHF cases increase by 54 per cent in Selangor
--------------------------------------------------------------
SHAH ALAM (Selangor): An alarming increase in dengue fever and dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases has been recorded this year with a total of
823 cases up to Sat 9 Mar 2002, which is 54 per cent higher than the number
reported over the same period last year. Two deaths have been reported and
all local authorities in the state have been ordered to set up operation
centers to monitor the outbreak.
The Shah Alam City Council tops the list with 199 cases, followed by
Selayang (130), Subang Jaya (129), Petaling Jaya (112), Klang (69), Kajang
(52) and Ampang Jaya (29). State Health Committee chairman Datuk Tang See
Hang said that the 2 fatal cases were a 40 year old woman from Taman Sri
Serdang and a 19 month old boy from Section 27, Shah Alam. He added that
103 cases were reported last week, the highest so far this year. "This is a
worrying trend, especially with the dry weather coupled with the water
shortage in the Klang Valley, and we urge the public to take precautions,"
he told a press conference yesterday.
Tang called on local authorities to organise "gotong-royong" sessions,
noting that the Shah Alam City Council would be holding one at Section 27
on Sun 24 Mar 2002, to be attended by Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Khir
Toyo. Tang said the state and municipal health departments would carry out
more frequent inspections of premises for _Aedes_ larvae and issue
on-the-spot compounds of up to RM500.

Hawai (Maui): dengue fever waning but risk remains
--------------------------------------------------
A total of 6 cases of dengue fever have been reported on Maui this month,
and visitors to the Hawaiian island are being reminded to be cautious when
visiting the damp east Maui area. Of a statewide total of 117 confirmed
cases of dengue since last June, 88 were from Maui (mostly from Hana, in
the east); 25 were from Oahu (primarily on the windward side); and 4 were
from Kauai.
Health officials said last week that dengue was on the wane and that all
but one of the latest cases involved belated reports of past illnesses.
Nevertheless, they still recommended that those entering east Maui and
windward Oahu wear long sleeves and pants in light colors, and spray
mosquito repellent with DEET on clothes and uncovered skin.
Heavy rains throughout Hawaii in January had health officials worried about
mosquitoes breeding in standing water, but February turned out to be dry.
The disease is transmitted by a mosquito [_Aedes aegypti_ after it has
bitten an infected person. There is no vaccination for dengue. The flu-like
symptoms, which last about a week, include fever, headache, muscle, eye and
joint pain, and rash. Rest, fluids and over-the-counter pain medication are
recommended.

Dengue outbreak more severe than during 2001
--------------------------------------------
In the first 3 months of this year in El Salvador, dengue fever has already
affected twice the number of people affected during the same period of time
in 2001. In the period from the 15 Jan to 15 Mar 2001 a total of 191 cases
of dengue fever were diagnosed in the country. This year the total number
is 421 people affected.
Three cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) were confirmed for the same
period of 2001. This year the number of cases of confirmed DHF has reached 39.

Schools on Rarotonga reopen
---------------------------
There are plans in the Cook Islands to establish a department responsible
for monitoring dengue fever in the country. Cabinet Minister Norman George,
head of operations (Ngamu), says that a department will be set up for the
ongoing spraying and maintenance of the areas known to harbor mosquitoes
carrying dengue virus.
Last month over 30 people needed hospital treatment, and there were 250
suspected cases. The dengue outbreak also forced schools on Rarotonga to
close for 2 weeks. Mr George says the three week spraying campaign has
allowed schools to reopen, and halved the number of dengue cases. He says
the proposed department will operate [in accordance with traditional
custom in the Cooks.

Australia: imported case of dengue fever in Townsville (Queensland)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Townsville has recorded its first case of dengue fever for the season,
although the case is said to have been contracted overseas. Townsville City
Council Environmental Services Committee Chairwoman Ann Bunnell said that
the case was an Aitkenvale resident, who had contracted dengue fever
overseas. She stated that there had not been any transmission locally.
Queensland Health and the Council's Environmental Health officers were
carrying out intensive inspections of properties in the immediate vicinity
of the patient's home. The Council's dengue control program was continuing,
with house-to-house inspections in selected suburbs every week and
education kits being distributed in suburbs and schools.
