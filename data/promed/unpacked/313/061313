Experts link nodding to black flies
-----------------------------------
President Museveni [Uganda] pledged helicopters for aerial spraying of black flies believed to be a cause of the disease.

Experts have said they are getting clues that the black fly associated with river blindness could be the cause of nodding disease. Prof James Tumwine, a pediatrics and child health expert at Mulago Hospital, said 80 per cent of children studied in southern Sudan had onchocerciasis parasites in their bodies, which cause an abnormal electric flow in the brain.

He said CT scans also revealed structural damage to the brain of the victims, which in turn increases brain activity in form of epileptic seizures.

"As a child nods, you can see that the child electric brain activity is very high, consequently causing seizures and convulsions in the rest of the body parts, and we have absolutely no doubt that river blindness is connected to this condition," Prof Tumwine said during president Museveni's visit to the 24 nodding victims at Mulago Hospital yesterday [6 Mar 2012].

However, the ministry of health officials accompanying the president said the new revelation is not conclusive and that there could be other factors, or combination of factors which they will continue investigating until they get to the root of the problem.

The president, who commended Kitgum Woman MP Beatrice Anywar's support to the affected children, directed the health ministry to carry out mass treatment for onchocerca parasites in the victims and spraying of black flies in affected districts.

The disease is said to have taken toll in the villages along River Pader, through Agago, crossing over to Kitgum, South Sudan, and areas around River Aswa.

The president also suggested killing the fly that is specifically found along very fast flowing rivers, but health minister Christine Ondoa said the exercise could be difficult, due to the nature of the fly and its movement.

Mr Museveni said helicopters could be availed for aerial spraying of the flies. The children are currently being treated using sodium valproate -- an anticonvulsant used in the treatment of epilepsy, anorexia nervosa, panic attack, posttraumatic stress disorder, as well as other psychiatric conditions.

Meanwhile, the attendants of the children at Mulago are said to have refused posho [east African dish of maize flour] and beans saying since the government considered their plea, they should have a diet change. When asked whether the children were improving, in unison, the attendants said that the condition of the children was still the same.

At least 3000 children are affected by nodding and 200 have since died of it.

[ProMED-mail reviewed the literature on nodding disease (ND) in our posting from 15 Dec 2011 (archive no 20111215.3605). It was first described in 1962 and the link to onchocerciasis (transmitted by black flies) suggested in 1994. The electrical brain activity referred to here is probably an EEG (electroencephalography), which is pathological in most diseases of the central nervous system. Nodding disease is perceived as a variant of epilepsy and it is not surprising that the EEG is abnormal, but it provides little clue to the cause of the disease. MRI scans are usually better to pick up changes in the brain than CT scans and a study that performed MRI on 7 patients with ND found that 4 had normal scans (Winkler AS, et al. The head nodding syndrome -- clinical classification and possible causes. Epilepsia. 2008; 49(12): 2008-15; available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2008.01671.x/full). Thus the cause of ND remains elusive. - Mod.EP
