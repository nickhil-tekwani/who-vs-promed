SPORADIC CASES OF HEMORRHAGIC ESCHERICHIOSIS
Mar. 17/98
Oregon Health Division CD Summary
ESCHERICHIA COLI O157:H7 (O157) is an important cause of bloody and
non-bloody diarrhea, as well as the major cause of pediatric and perhaps
adult hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This issue reviews O157 infections
in Oregon and the U.S. and new data about sporadic infections. O157
infections became reportable in Oregon in mid-1990, and the number of cases
reported annually since 1991 has ranged from 90-244 (median, 105; see
graph). O157 reporting in Oregon is relatively mature compared to many of
the United States, reflecting the longer history of reporting, generally
better physician awareness, and relatively sensitive laboratory practices.
Thus, the Oregon case rate (~3.3/100,000/year) is probably closer to reality
than rates derived from national tallies. (2,741 cases were reported to CDC
in 1996 [Equivalent to ~ 0.9/100,000/year. -- RAL.) Even in Oregon,
though, reported case totals underestimate the true burden of illness. Many
persons suffer without seeking medical care; many physicians do not obtain
cultures; many laboratories do not look for the pathogen; etc. (A 1996
survey of Oregon laboratories that do stool cultures showed that 74%
routinely culture for O157; an additional 22% routinely culture all bloody
diarrhea for O157.)
The true national incidence has been [estimated at 10,000-20,000 cases
per year (and lets not ignore asymptomatic infections, which are common).
Since 1982, many outbreaks of O157 infection have been described in the
literature. While under cooked hamburger has been repeatedly implicated,1,2
raw milk, apple cider, venison, salad bar fixings, lettuce, and alfalfa
sprouts have also been identified as vehicles in food-borne outbreaks.3-7
Outbreaks have also been linked to person-to-person transmission: in
day-care centers, from swimming in contaminated lake water, and by
consumption of sewage-contaminated drinking water.8-10 The vast majority of
O157 infections are sporadic, however, with no identified link to any other
case; only 224 (25%) of the 891 cases reported in Oregon from 1991-97 were
outbreak-associated. Almost by definition, the specific exposures
responsible for sporadic infections are rarely confirmable.
SURVEY METHODS
To identify risky foods and practices associated with sporadic O157
infection, the FoodNet project, which is part of the Emerging Infections
Program, recently completed a case-control study in Food-Net surveillance
areas.* A case was defined as a person with culture-confirmed O157 infection
with specimen collection date occurring between March 27, 1996, and March
26, 1997, inclusive. Cases were excluded if they: lived outside of Oregon;
were not reachable by phone; did not speak English; were unable to answer
questions; had no history of diarrhea or were unable to provide a diarrhea
onset date; had onset of diarrhea more than 10 days before the specimen
collection date; had onset of diarrhea within 28 days of another
culture-confirmed case of O157 infection within the same house-hold (i.e.,
were secondary cases); or were part of an outbreak where the source was
clearly identified.
Cases and controls were interrogated over the telephone by trained personnel
using a standardized questionnaire. Cases were interviewed within 21 days of
the date of the fateful specimen collection. Two age- and phone
prefix-matched controls were found for each case. Controls were excluded if
they: resided outside of Oregon; did not speak English; were unable to
answer questions; had diarrhea within 28 days of the matched cases onset; or
had a household member with culture-confirmed O157 infection within 28 days
of the matched cases onset. We asked about food consumption in the 5 days
prior to illness, food handling practices, medication use, contact with
animals, and travel outside the country. An exposure was considered to be a
risk factor if the matched odds ratio (OR) was significantly greater than one.
Similarly, an exposure was considered to be protective if the OR was
significantly less than one.
RESULTS
Seventy-four cases of culture-confirmed O157 infection were reported in
Oregon during the one-year period. Twenty-three (31%) of the cases were
hospitalized, and one died. Sixteen cases did not meet the inclusion
criteria and were excluded from the study. Fifty-eight cases were enrolled
in the study, each with two age-matched controls. Cases and controls did
not differ significantly with regard to age, sex, race, education or
income. Only two potential exposures from a long list were associated with
an in-creased risk: visiting or living on a farm (OR=2.8; 95% CI, 1.2-7.0)
and, more specifically, visiting or living on a farm where there are cows
(OR=3.5; 95% CI, 1.1-13.0). Only a minority of cases had these risks,
however, making the population attributable risk low.

Neither eating hamburger, eating in restaurants or fast-food outlets, nor
spending time in day-care facilities was associated with sporadic
infections. Consumption of several foods (lettuce at home, raw carrots,
celery, cantaloupe, and honeydew melon) was found to be protective i.e.,
associated with a reduced risk of infection.
DISCUSSION
Data from many studies suggest that cattle feces in one guise or another are
the most common source of human infections, although it is now clear that
they are not the only source. The relative importance of domesticated and
wild animals in the maintenance and distribution of O157 is much less clear,
however, as is the potential role of environmental reservoirs such as water,
soil, or animal feeds. Our finding that farm exposure (particularly when
cows are present) is associated with risk of infection is certainly
consistent with the importance of animal contact, but obviously leaves many
questions unanswered.
In this study, hamburger consumption per se was not associated with sporadic
illness. Why not? One possibility is that times have changed. We would like
to believe that the steady drumbeat of publicity about the hazards of rare
or raw ground beef particularly since the Jack-in- the-Box outbreak in 1993
has translated into more people cooking their burgers well done, and there
is some evidence to support this. In addition, changes in meat processing
may well have translated into a reduced likelihood of meat being
contaminated in the first place. Still, a recent telephone survey found that
20% of Oregonians prefer their burgers pink, although we don't know how
often this blood lust is satisfied. The small numbers of cases in this study
may have precluded our finding a significant association. No association
with hamburger consumption was seen when Oregon data were aggregated with
other FoodNet sites, but in that analysis consumption of pink hamburgers or
pink ground beef (OR=3.5; 95% CI, 1.7-7.3) was a risk factor, 11 consistent
with several older studies.
Despite growing concern about the risk of foodborne illness arising from
contaminated produce, we identified no such risks in this study. The
statistical power of this kind of study to detect genuine but low risk
exposures is limited, of course, or it could be that sporadic infections are
rarely attributable to contaminated vegetables. While not terribly
profound, it
is also plausible that persons who eat lots of produce are less likely to
eat lots of meat. So if consumption of flesh is associated with increased
risk, vegetable eaters would tend to be at reduced risk. Persons who dine
out were not at a greater risk for sporadic O157 infection than those who
eat at home. Although many of us have the tendency to impute our
gastrointestinal woes to the last meal that was prepared by somebody else,
it appears that home cooking may not be appreciably safer than commercial
stuff. Certainly it is easier to detect restaurant-associated outbreaks,
which can affect dozens or thousands of persons, than two or three cases in
a household caused by similar mishandling.
CONCLUSION
The O157 story is more complicated than just rare burgers, and the source
of most sporadic infections remains obscure. In the meantime, we ask you to
encourage your patients to wash their hands, cook their meat well, and
enjoy (but don't cross-contaminate) their fruits and vegetables.
