An ongoing multi-state outbreak of measles linked
to non-immune anthroposophic communities in
Austria, Germany, and Norway, March- April 2008
-----------------------------------------------
From the 2nd week of March 2008, public health
authorities in the province of Salzburg observed
an increased number of measles cases compared to
previous years. 20 cases of measles were notified
Austria-wide in 2007, 24 in 2006, 10 in 2005, and
14 in 2004.

The current outbreak has affected, as of 14 Apr
2008, 202 people in Austria, 53 in Germany, and 4
in Norway, bringing the total number of cases
related to this outbreak to 259. The initial case
series investigation revealed that the common
link was attendance at an anthroposophic school
and day care centre in Salzburg city. The
majority of the pupils were not vaccinated
against measles.

An outbreak case was defined as a person who: a)
became ill with measles after 1 Mar 2008,
fulfilling the clinical criteria of measles
regardless of laboratory confirmation, and b) was
epidemiologically linked to Salzburg city in the
period 7 to 18 days prior to clinical onset.

Outbreak investigation
------------------------
As of 14 Apr 2008, 183 cases of measles
restricted to 4 public health districts in the
province Salzburg, 16 cases from the neighboring
province Upper Austria, and one case each in the
Austrian provinces Tyrol, Vorarlberg and Vienna
fulfilled the preliminary outbreak case
definition. In addition, 50 outbreak cases, most
of them with residence in Bavaria, 3 cases of
measles in the state Baden-Wurttemberg in
Germany, and 4 outbreak cases resident in Norway
were identified.

The epidemic curve by onset of rash of 256
notified cases for whom data on clinical onset
were available is illustrated diagrammatically in
the text of the original article. [The curves are
more or less coincident for the different
provinces and countries]. In 78.5 percent (201)
of these cases, a link to the particular school
and day care centre in Salzburg city has been
identified so far. Questioning of the cases is
still ongoing. A 2nd figure in the original text
summarizes the age and sex distribution of 259
cases. [Again the distributions are almost
coincident. - Mod.CP]

Since the 3rd week of March 2008, the Austrian
health authority has put in place a range of
outbreak control measures raising awareness in
the overall population and encouraging measles,
mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine uptake,
supported by proactive media releases;
dissemination of information to schools and
nurseries; closure of the particular school and
day care centre for one week; post-exposure
prophylaxis for contact persons if appropriate;
control of vaccination documents in all persons
of the affected institution; access restriction
to school for all persons with unclear immune
status; after re-opening of the anthroposophic
school, access restriction for pupils other than
those vaccinated at least once and those with
serologically documented previous infection;
offering MMR vaccination free of charge to the
population younger than 15 years; and alerting
health professionals.

Preliminary results of the outbreak investigation
indicate the possible source case: a student from
an anthroposophic school in Switzerland who
visited the anthroposophic school in Salzburg
city with colleagues. That student became ill
with measles during their stay in Salzburg on 7
Mar 2008, a week prior to the primary outbreak
case in the anthroposophic school in Salzburg (13
Mar 2008). Since November 2006, Switzerland is
experiencing the largest measles outbreak
registered in the country since notification for
this disease in 1999 [1].

Conclusions
-------------
Recently, ultra-orthodox Jewish communities and
traveling communities have been implicated in
outbreaks of measles [2,3]. The outbreak
described here indicates that the anthroposophic
community also is an at-risk group of measles
spread, because many parents in this group choose
not to vaccinate their children with the MMR
vaccine [4]. Anthroposophy, based on the writings
of the mystic and social philosopher Rudolf
Steiner (1861-1925), combines human development
with an investigation of the divine spark found
in all of nature. The movement has marked
education (Waldorf/Steiner schools) and medicine.
Anthroposophical doctors emphasize nature-based
therapies that support the body's innate healing
wisdom. Antibiotics, fever-reducing agents, and
vaccinations are used at one's own discretion
only [5].

Although measles has been eliminated or is under
control in several EU countries, it is still a
public health priority [6]. Organizers of
large-scale events attended by international
travelers, especially youths, should consider
documentation of adequate participant vaccination
[7]. In view of the current measles outbreak,
Austrian and Swiss authorities advise measles
vaccination before traveling to the EURO 2008
soccer games, starting on 7 Jun 2008 in Austria
and Switzerland.

The current multi-state outbreak of measles once
again highlights the need to improve the
vaccination coverage in Austria, along with
disease surveillance and outbreak-control
capabilities [8]. Diligent case investigation of
every single measles case is a prerequisite to
achieving the goal of measles eradication by
2010, planned by the World Health Organization
European Office [9].

[This multi-state outbreak of measles once again
highlights the need to elevate the level of
acceptance of MMR vaccination throughout Europe.
In this instance, the common link between
outbreaks in Austria (202 cases), Germany (53
cases) and Norway (4 cases) appears to have been
attendance at an anthroposophic (Waldorf/Steiner)
school and day care centre in Salzburg, Austria.
The index case was a visitor from Switzerland,
and the majority of the children affected had not
been vaccinated against measles. - Mod.CP]
