Ministry of Health figures show 3342 people were admitted to hospital with pneumonia during Jan - Apr 2015, which is 168 more than the same period of 2014, and almost 1000 more than in 2005. Year-on-year figures show the number of people hospitalised with pneumonia has consistently increased each year since 2005, from 10 540 cases to 14 393 in 2014. The elderly were most susceptible.

Pneumonia killed 3225 New Zealanders between 2005-2011, the ministry revealed, but data for the number of deaths over the past 3.5 years [were] not available.

Starship Children's Hospital paediatrician Dr Cameron Grant, an associate professor at Auckland University and expert on the illness, said he'd observed a spike in pneumonia sufferers this year. "We don't usually get the big pneumonia season until July, August, September, so everyone's feeling a little bit nervous about this winter," he said. Grant said factors like damp housing and people not getting vaccinated were partly to blame.

"We're a malnourished population in that we've got high rates of obesity and high rates of micronutrient deficiency, and both of those things are probably bad news from an infection point of view," he said. "Smoking in the household remains a significant issue -- it's among the few places now where you're allowed to smoke and therefore children get it, and that can cause all sorts of problems." Keeping homes heated in the winter cold was also key he said.

[The news report above says there has been a progressively higher incidence of pneumonia each year since 2005 in New Zealand, and that this increase has apparently occurred during New Zealand's summer months (January-April), as well as the rest of the year. Causes of pneumonia during the summer months include Legionnaires' disease, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, and enteroviruses; most other bacterial (_Streptococcus pneumoniae_, _Chlamydophila pneumoniae_, _Hemophilus influenzae_, and _Staphylococcus aureus_) and respiratory viruses (influenza virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus) are responsible for pneumonia during the rest of the year.

Adults 65 years of age or older and children less than 5 years of age are particularly at risk, and some respiratory pathogens are more likely to cause pneumonia in certain age groups; but we are not told the age distribution of cases. Community-acquired pneumonia in young children is most commonly due to viral pathogens; Respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus are more common in children under 5 years of age (http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/15750086) and _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ and _Chlamydophila pneumoniae_ in school-aged children and their families (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/5/681.full.pdf).

We are not told the distribution of cases among ethnic or socioeconomic groups. Pneumonia in New Zealand has been found to be more common in certain ethnic groups and in poor minority groups, where exposure to tobacco smoke, poor housing quality, overcrowded conditions, and reduced access to primary healthcare (e.g., vaccinations) are likely more common (http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/health-and-society/page-2).

Pneumococcal and _Hemophilus influenzae_ vaccines can prevent bacterial pneumonia due to these organisms, and the incidence of vaccine-preventable pneumococcal pneumonia in Maori and Pacific peoples is approximately 3 times higher than in non-Maori (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16718289), suggesting that access to these vaccines may be lower in Maori and Pacific peoples. Hospitalization rates for pneumonia, as a marker for severity of disease, were highest for Pacific Islanders, intermediate for Maori, and lowest for Europeans (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9727178); in addition, Maori are 6 times more likely to die from pneumonia than non-Maori (http://www.bpac.org.nz/BPJ/2012/August/pneumonia.aspx).

The causes of pneumonia are diverse, but the news report fails to provide sufficient information to identify the cause(s) of the increasing pneumonia incidence in New Zealand since 2005. More information from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML]

[Does the much higher death rate among Maori reflect a difference in hospital care or a reluctance to go to hospital until it is too late? - Mod.JW]
