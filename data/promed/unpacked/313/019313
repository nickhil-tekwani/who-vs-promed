Spread of leaf blight disease, locally known as patapocha rog, has
put potato farmers of Nilphamari district in a difficult situation.
Department of Agricultural Extension [DAE] sources said that many
farmers cultivated potato this year [2009] instead of wheat and
tobacco with a hope of good harvest and windfall profit.

But the widespread attack of the disease has created tension among
the farmers, as well as huge losses, as spraying to save potato crops
from the disease is adding to their production cost. This has been
caused by cold and foggy weather and fluctuation in temperatures that
helped the disease to spread on potato plants early, DAE said.

About 35 000 hectares of land were brought under potato cultivation
in the current season, DAE sources said.

[There are 2 major leaf blights of potato, both due to fungus-like
organisms. Early blight (_Alternaria solani_) causes symptoms of
spotting and early senescence of leaflets, as well as lesions on
tubers. Infected plants remain symptomless until they approach
maturity, and yield is reduced. Late blight (_Phytophthora
infestans_) affects both leaves and tubers. This pathogen may cause
100 percent crop losses in potato and tomato, and solanaceous weeds
can serve as pathogen reservoirs. Considerable variation in
aggressiveness between different _P. infestans_ strains has been
observed.

Early blight occurs over a wider range of climatic conditions than
late blight. The pathogens are spread with infected plant material
(including tubers), by mechanical means, wind, and rain. Management
strategies for both diseases include fungicide treatments of seed
tubers and crops, as well as use of cultivars with reduced
susceptibility. For more disease information, see links and previous
ProMED-mail posts listed below.

Both leaf blights were reported in Bangladesh in 2008, and several
outbreaks of late blight have occurred in the region, including
Bangaldesh, in 2009. It is possible that either pathogen or a
combination of both is the cause of the problems reported above. The
emergence of new pathogen strains with increased fungicide
resistances can also not be excluded.
