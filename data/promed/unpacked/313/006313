--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
------------
Between [1 Jan 2020] and [28 Aug 2020], the total number of COVID-19 cases reported in the Americas exceeded the number of cases reported in all the remaining 5 WHO Regions during the same period by 1.4 million cases. As of [28 Aug 2020], a total of 13 005 995 cases of COVID-19, including 458 444 deaths, have been reported in the 54 countries/areas/territories in the Region of the Americas.

During the previous 4 weeks, a 26% relative increase in cases and 20% relative increase in deaths has been observed. A median of 132 322 new cases and 3697 new deaths were reported every 24 hours over the past 2 weeks. Furthermore, during the previous 4 weeks, the highest relative increases in cases and deaths were observed in the subregions of the Caribbean Atlantic ocean islands (33% in cases and 35% in deaths), Central America (33% in cases and 28% in deaths), and South America (33% in cases and 27% in deaths).

Given the epidemiological situation in the Region, which has overwhelmed the current capacity of the healthcare systems and has the potential to continue, strengthening healthcare services is a priority. Healthcare workers are crucial to maintaining healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the greatest risks to the healthcare system is the potentially high rate of infections due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), among healthcare workers. This could subsequently lead to a lack of availability of trained personnel to guarantee an adequate local and/or regional response to the pandemic. This risk has been augmented by a need to rapidly increase the capacity of intensive care units (ICUs), the redeployment of clinical staff to front-line positions (for example, ICU or COVID-19 patient care rooms), and the recruitment of less experienced personnel (such as recent graduates or healthcare workers from unrelated specialties) into the workforce to respond to the pandemic.

In addition, transmission in the healthcare setting has also been reported. Transmission of COVID-19 includes direct contact and via droplets. Additionally, aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) also play an important role in the transmission of COVID-19 within the context of healthcare services.

Healthcare workers can be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 through unprotected contact with infected patients or through contact with other infected healthcare workers. Exposure in the healthcare services context could be due to non-compliance with infection prevention and control (IPC) standards, inappropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), lack of or inadequate PPE, insufficient training, stress, work pressure, working overtime, and limited availability of healthcare workers, amongst other reasons.

As of [19 Aug 2020], according to available information from 19 /1 countries in the Region of the Americas, a total of 569 304 cases of COVID-19, including 2506 deaths, have been reported among healthcare workers. Of these, 72% are female, and the age groups with the highest proportions of confirmed cases are 30-39 years and 40-49 years.

COVID-19 among healthcare workers in selected countries
-------------------------------------------------------
In Argentina, between epidemiological week (EW) 11 and EW 31 of 2020 [8 Mar 1 Aug 2020], a total of 16 194 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported among healthcare workers (Figure 1). The highest proportion of cases was observed among persons aged 29-39 years (39%), followed by 40-50 years (28%), 51-61 years (16%), 18-28 years (14%), and 62 years and older (3%).

In Brazil, between [26 Feb 2020] and [22 Aug 2020], a total of 1 212 430 cases of influenza-like illness with suspected COVID-19 were reported among healthcare workers. Of these, 268 954 (22%) were confirmed for COVID-19. The highest proportion of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was among nursing technicians and assistants (34%, 92 324 cases), followed by nurses (14%; 39 058 cases), doctors (11%, 28 596 cases), community health workers (5%, 13 189 cases), and health unit administrative personnel (4%, 11 611 cases) (Figure 2).

Between EW 1 and EW 34 of 2020 [1 Jan-22 Aug 2020], 1738 hospitalized cases of severe acute respiratory infection /2 (SARI) were reported among healthcare workers /3. Of these 1093 (63%) were confirmed for COVID-19 and 395 (23%) remain under investigation. Of the total hospitalized SARI cases among healthcare workers, 62% were female. The highest proportions of hospitalized SARI cases among healthcare workers were observed among nursing technicians and assistants (33%), doctors (20%), and nurses (20%) (Table 1)

Of the 1738 hospitalized SARI cases among healthcare workers as of EW 34 of 2020, there were 289 (17%) deaths, the majority of which were due to COVID-19 (83%). Of the total number of SARI deaths among healthcare workers, 50% were female, and the highest numbers were among nursing technicians and assistants (94 deaths), doctors (52 deaths), and nurses (41 deaths) (Table 1).

In Colombia, between [1 Mar 2020] and [20 Aug 2020], a total of 7692 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported among healthcare workers, including 52 deaths, 7362 recovered, and 278 in isolation. Of the total confirmed cases, 600 (8%) were asymptomatic. Of the total confirmed cases among healthcare workers, 67% (5142 cases) developed infection following exposure associated with the provision of healthcare services, 15% (1150 cases) developed infection following exposure in the community, 1% (43 cases) were imported, and 18% (1357 cases) for which exposure was undetermined (Figure 3). The highest proportions of cases were observed among nursing assistants (34%), doctors (16%), nurses (13%), administrative personnel (11%), and cleaning and food personnel (4%).

In the Dominican Republic, between [1 Jan 2020] and [23 Aug 2020], a total of 272 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported among healthcare workers, of which 64% were female. The Dominican Republic Ministry of Public Health General Directorate of Epidemiology updates this information regularly and is available at https://bit.ly/3h9tbNj.

In Mexico, between [28 Feb 2020] (when the 1st case of COVID-19 was detected) and [23 Aug 2020], a total of 97 632 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported among healthcare workers, of which 60% were female. Of the total confirmed cases, 42% were among nurses, 28% among other health professions, 27% among doctors, 2% among laboratory specialists, and 1% among dentists. During the same period, 1320 deaths have been reported, representing 1.4% of the confirmed cases; of the total deaths, 70% were male.

In Paraguay, between [13 Mar 2020] and [21 Aug 2020], there have been 6869 healthcare workers with reported exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 620 were laboratory-confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including one death, which accounts for 5% of the total number of confirmed cases reported nationally (Figure 4). The health regions with the highest proportions of healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 are the Capital (39%), Central (28%), and Alto Parana (10%). Of the 620 confirmed cases among healthcare workers as of [21 Aug 2020], 70% were female and the highest proportion has been observed among persons aged 29-39 years (46%), followed by 40-50 years (21%), 18-28 years (15%), and 51-61 years (11%). Overall, 86% developed signs or symptoms of COVID-19. Among the confirmed cases, 33% were among nurse personnel, 28% among medical personnel, 4% among laboratory personnel, and 29% other health professions/services. Of the total confirmed cases, 40% (250 cases) developed infection following exposure in a healthcare setting, and of these, 60% had exposure through contact with an infected healthcare worker, 34% through patient care, 4% through assistance in shelters, 2% through care in prisons.

In the United States of America, between [1 Jan 2020] and [24 Aug 2020], there were 143 100 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 660 deaths, reported among healthcare workers. Of the total confirmed cases among healthcare workers, 79% are female and the highest proportion of cases was reported among 29 to 39-year-olds (27%), followed by 40 to 50-year-olds (23%), 18 to 28-year-olds (23%), 51 to 61-year-olds (20%), and persons aged 62 years and older (8%).

[The number of affected healthcare workers (HCWs) in the Region of the Americas is sobering, to say the least, surpassing half a million known cases.

According to the WHO Situation update for 19 Aug 2020, the total number of reported cases in the Americas region was 11 758 006 cases, of which 569 304 (4.8%) were reported in HCWs (COVID-19 update (368): testing, countries, WHO, global 20200820.7698002). If one followed media reports of the situation in the countries in the Americas Region during the initial peak overwhelming of the healthcare systems, lack of PPE (personal protective equipment -- masks, gloves, gowns, eye shields) was a common complaint/occurrence in the countries. There were reports from the USA, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Mexico that made the USA media. Looking at the figures (graphs) provided, one disturbing observation is that in those locations where epidemic curves were provided, there continue to be weekly increases in cases reported, indicative of continued infections occurring in HCWs. Also noteworthy is that nurses seem to consistently be the most affected professionals in the highlighted countries, followed by doctors and then other personnel, including laboratory, pharmacy, and administrative personnel. The continued rise in HCW cases is disconcerting and one wonders what is behind it. - Mod.MPP]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
Little is known about the prevalence and features of SARS-CoV-2 infection among frontline US health care personnel.

What is added by this report?
Among 3248 personnel observed, 6% had antibody evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection; 29% of personnel with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were asymptomatic in the preceding months, and 69% had not previously received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was lower among personnel who reported always wearing a face covering while caring for patients (6%), compared with those who did not (9%).

What are the implications for public health practice?
A high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections among health care personnel appear to go undetected. Universal use of face coverings and lowering clinical thresholds for testing could be important strategies for reducing hospital transmission.

During [3 Apr 2020-19 Jun 2020], serum specimens were collected from a convenience sample of frontline HCP who worked with COVID-19 patients at 13 geographically diverse academic medical centers in the United States, and specimens were tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Participants were asked about potential symptoms of COVID-19 experienced since [1 Feb 2020], previous testing for acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the past week. Among 3248 participants, 194 (6.0%) had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seroprevalence by hospital ranged from 0.8% to 31.2% (median = 3.6%). Among the 194 seropositive participants, 56 (29%) reported no symptoms since [1 Feb 2020], 86 (44%) did not believe that they previously had COVID-19, and 133 (69%) did not report a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. Seroprevalence was lower among personnel who reported always wearing a face covering (defined in this study as a surgical mask, N95 respirator, or powered air purifying respirator [PAPR]) while caring for patients (5.6%), compared with that among those who did not (9.0%) (p = 0.012). Consistent with persons in the general population with SARS-CoV-2 infection, many frontline HCP with SARS-CoV-2 infection might be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic during infection, and infection might be unrecognized. Enhanced screening, including frequent testing of frontline HCP, and universal use of face coverings in hospitals are 2 strategies that could reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Discussion
----------
This study resulted in the identification of t2wo factors potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCP: PPE shortages and interacting with patients without wearing a face covering. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining PPE supplies at hospitals caring for COVID-19 patients and, assuming adequate supply, adhering to policies that encourage the use of masks for all interactions between HCP and patients. Universal masking has been associated with a significantly lower rate of infection among HCP.

The risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from HCP to others within hospitals might be mitigated by adherence to recommended practices such as universal use of face coverings and suggestions to have dedicated cohorts of HCP caring for patients with COVID-19. In addition to maintaining PPE supplies and instituting universal face covering policies for HCP at work, enhanced screening, including frequent testing of frontline HCP, and universal use of face coverings in hospitals are strategies that could reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

[The complete article including references is available at the source URL above. The findings of this study are not surprising. The use of facemasks and other PPEs has clearly made a difference in disease transmission, both inside the healthcare system and outside of the healthcare system.

I still remember during the SARS-CoV-1 outbreaks one New York Times Op-Ed piece from an internist in New York City in which he said one didn't need to wear face masks when seeing patients unless there was a high level of suspicion for SARS-CoV-1 in a patient. At the time I wondered whether we (the medical profession) were looking at this wrong and should start routinely using face masks, not being able to second-guess who might be infected with a high risk respiratory virus. And I can't help but wonder if the world will go back to no masks and second-guessing who might have a high risk respiratory virus after this pandemic is behind us. It took a long time for the healthcare professions to accept universal precautions as a response to HIV, but hepatitis B virus had been around for years and was a greater risk for the healthcare professionals. Time will tell vis a vis universal respiratory precautions. - Mod.MPP]

[3] China: Wastewater role in transmission, susp.

ref: Gormley M. SARS-CoV-2: The growing case for potential transmission in a building via wastewater plumbing systems. [published online ahead of print, 2020 Sep 1]. Ann Intern Med. 2020; 10.7326/M20-6134. doi:10.7326/M20-6134
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is a stark reminder of the role people and buildings play in the transmission of viruses. The pandemic has led us to review all building systems, particularly those involving airflow, and all procedures and system phenomena that produce aerosols. There is a growing body of evidence that built environment systems contribute to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In their current report, Kang and colleagues (1) add wastewater plumbing systems to the catalogue of potential transmission pathways in buildings (1).

Viral transmission dynamics fall into 2 main groups: direct contact between an infected and a susceptible person and indirect contact by a susceptible person with virus shed in droplets or aerosols from an infected person. Indirect transmission occurs when a susceptible person touches a surface contaminated by droplets or aerosols containing infectious virus and then touches their mouth or nose, or by inhaling infective droplets or aerosols from environmental systems.

Kang and colleagues report a case in which transmission probably occurred by indirect contact in an apartment building: Viral particles seem to have been carried on air streams within the pipe network and entered the interior of the building from the wastewater system. Aerosols, typically less than 5 microm in diameter, are light enough to be carried in air, whereas larger droplets tend to fall out of the air before traveling long distances. Kang and colleagues describe a situation in which infectious aerosols may have been formed as the result of turbulent flows within a wastewater plumbing system containing virus-laden feces.

Work by my team identified the mechanisms involved in transmission dynamics between 2 different interconnected yet separate spaces within a building (4,5). The work was in response to the World Health Organization (WHO) report in 2003 (6) of a SARS outbreak in Amoy Gardens, a housing complex in Hong Kong, which led to the infection of 321 persons and resulted in 42 deaths (7,8). The WHO hypothesized that empty U-traps in the plumbing system created a pathway for virus-laden droplets and aerosols to enter bathrooms and spread the infection as residents touched contaminated surfaces. The transmission pathway was aided by mechanical bathroom extract fans and favorable outdoor air conditions, which allowed an additional transmission pathway on the outside of the building.

However, the authors cast appropriate caution about their findings and have not overstated the evidence. Although evidence is building, it is not yet strong enough to warrant wide-scale intervention -- but does warrant some precautions. The authors and others working in this field highlight the possibility that a virus, such as SARS-CoV-2, may be transmitted in the manner described by Kang and colleagues (1). However, building wastewater systems are a potential reservoir for many other viruses and bacteria; even in the absence of SARS-CoV-2, this is a cause for concern.

In conclusion, Kang and colleagues add to the growing body of evidence that wastewater plumbing systems, particularly those in high-rise buildings, deserve closer investigation, both immediately in the context of SARS-CoV-2 and in the long term, because they may be a reservoir for other harmful pathogens.

ref: Kang M, Wei J, Yuan J, et al. Probable evidence of fecal aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a high-rise building [published online ahead of print, 2020 Sep 1]. Ann Intern Med. 2020; 10.7326/M20-0928. doi:10.7326/M20-0928
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
---------
"Background. The role of fecal aerosols in the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been suspected.
"Objective. To investigate the temporal and spatial distributions of 3 infected families in a high-rise apartment building and examine the associated environment variables to verify the role of fecal aerosols.
"Design: Epidemiologic survey and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses on throat swabs from the participants; 237 surface and air samples from 11 of the 83 flats in the building, public areas, and building drainage systems; and tracer gas released into bathrooms as a surrogate for virus-laden aerosols in the drainage system.
"Setting: A high-rise apartment building in Guangzhou, China.
"Participants: 9 infected patients, 193 other residents of the building, and 24 members of the building's management staff.
"Measurements: Locations of infected flats and positive environmental samples, and spread of virus-laden aerosols.
"Results: 9 infected patients in 3 families were identified. The 1st family had a history of travel to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epicenter Wuhan, whereas the other 2 families had no travel history and a later onset of symptoms. No evidence was found for transmission via the elevator or elsewhere. The families lived in 3 vertically aligned flats connected by drainage pipes in the master bathrooms. Both the observed infections and the locations of positive environmental samples are consistent with the vertical spread of virus-laden aerosols via these stacks and vents.
"Limitation: Inability to determine whether the water seals were dried out in the flats of the infected families.
"Conclusion: On the basis of circumstantial evidence, fecal aerosol transmission may have caused the community outbreak of COVID-19 in this high-rise building."

As I read this article (before reading the editorial), I thought of the Amoy Gardens outbreak of SARS-CoV-1 in Hong Kong in 2003. In the 2nd week of May 2020, there was a cluster of 6 locally transmitted cases in Wuhan where they resided in the same apartment complex. (COVID-19-update (176): China, S. Korea, countries w/ high local transmission 20200512.7325551, COVID-19-update (173): China, S. Korea, countries w/ high local transmission 20200511.7321974) which also recalled the experience in Hong Kong. Yet another avenue for research to address this possible/probable mechanism of spread of the virus. - Mod.MPP]

[A repetitive comment (for those who have read this before): These countries were selected on account of having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but having responded differently. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. Lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is continuing, and reported deaths have been increasing as well. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented, and as of 21 Aug 2020, they are being implemented again. In Italy and Spain, there are major increases in reported cases. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, wearing face masks, handwashing, and the avoidance of large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mods.MPP/UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory for 1 Sep 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesSept1_1598997523.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 42.1% of daily case numbers and 49.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 13.3 million cases. The USA and Brazil are dominant followed by Colombia, Peru, Argentina, and Mexico.

- The European region reported 11.0% of daily case numbers and 12.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 4.2 million. While Spain has been a dominant country in Europe, due to weekend artifact there were no reports submitted to WHO for this summary. In Spain's absence, Russia is the dominant country followed by France, Ukraine, Turkey, the UK, Germany, and Israel.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5,8% of daily case numbers and 7.9% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 1.9 million cases. Iraq remains the dominant country, followed by Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the Palestinian Authority.

- The African region reported 2.5% of daily case numbers and 4.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and have reported more than one million cases. While South Africa remains the dominant country, the numbers have been lower than in previous days and weeks, followed by Ethiopia, Algeria, and Cameroon.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.1% of daily case numbers and 2.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.49 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 36.5% of the daily newly reported cases and 23.6% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.2 million cases. India continues to dominate followed by Indonesia and Bangladesh.

Noteworthy is that the regional cumulative case count for South East Asia is closely approaching that of Europe, with daily newly confirmed cases almost 3 times that of Europe.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 1 Sep 2020, is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic. - Mod.MPP]

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (78 169), followed by the USA (45 775) and Brazil (41 889) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.0%). 6412 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (31 Aug 2020-1 Sep 2020).

Noteworthy in today's data is that Russia has crossed the 1 million mark of confirmed cases. Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Argentina (10 504), Colombia (8901), Spain (8115), Mexico (6476), and Peru (5092), and 27 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 6.1%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 2.2%.

Impression: Unchanged from recent days. The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality. The global 7-day averages seem to reflect a small increase in reporting confirmed cases, although deaths are decreasing. The European region is seeing increasing cases in western European countries that had markedly reduced transmission in late spring. The most severely affected region remains the Americas. - Mod.MPP]
