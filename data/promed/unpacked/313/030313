Preecha Ruengchan, governor of northern Thailand's province of
Phichit, called an urgent meeting with livestock officials on
Thursday [27 Sep 2007] after birds there were found to have died
without cause. Preecha is considering whether to declare Phichit the
bird flu zone, local newspaper Bangkok Post reported.
Thawatpong Paekwamdee, chief of Taphan Hin district of the province,
said that test results of carcasses of chickens raised by a villager
were found to have the H5N1 virus. The local authorities have killed
90 chickens within a 1-km (0.6 mi) radius from the location.
Transportation of birds is prohibited in the area unless receiving
authorization from authorities, who are keeping a close watch on the
spread of the virus within 5-km (3 mi) radius.

[Phichit is in the north, just south of the previously infected
province of Phitsanulok. The location of this Northern province
(number 11 on the map) can be seen at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Thailand>.
Other provinces that have been infected since January 2007 include
Phisanulok in the North, Nong Khai in the North East, and Ang Thong,
in the Central region. These backyard flocks get affected
intermittently at low, almost sporadic levels but they have persisted
over this last year. - Mod.PC]
