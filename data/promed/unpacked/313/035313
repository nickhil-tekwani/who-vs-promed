The ProMED-mail report (20081126.3730) reproduced a less
than absolutely accurate press report, which sought to sensationalise
one aspect of 2 hours worth of evidence given to a Fatal Accident
Inquiry (that is, comments on the sources of advice consulted). I
felt that the comment appended by the moderator after the entry was
potentially a little mischievous, and might be interpreted by some as
suggesting that there had been a lack of confidence by the Incident
Management Group in the expertise and experience available within the
UK from the HPA. Nothing could be further from the reality.

For the record I am more than happy to make it very clear that HPA
(Health Protection Agency) played a critical role throughout the
entire investigation and provided advice and support throughout the
incident, which was very much appreciated by all those involved in
its management. It was recognised at an early stage by all, including
colleagues within HPA, that given the unusual nature of the
situation, there was a lack of direct experience in dealing with
aspects of the incident. As a consequence it was recognised that
there would be merit on drawing from international experience outside
the UK within Europe and the USA. Hence, advice was taken from many
sources, much of this initiated by colleagues in HPA themselves.

As a result of the lessons learned from the Scottish incident by
everyone, hopefully we will all be better placed to manage any future
incidents.
