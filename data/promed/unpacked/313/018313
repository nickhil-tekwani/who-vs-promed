In the Abay region of Shymkent, 4 people contracted anthrax while cutting carcasses, As it turned out, the owner sold the meat of the sick animal at a cheap price.

Experts remind that you need to buy meat only in proven places, if the seller has a medical examination and a veterinary certificate.

Anthrax is an acute infectious disease that is one of the most dangerous. A person can get infected from a sick animal. It is not transmitted from person to person. One of the main measures for the prevention of anthrax is vaccination. It applies to livestock workers, persons involved in the processing, transportation and storage of animal skins. If sick animals are found, the veterinary service should be notified for timely action.

There are several types of anthrax manifestations - cutaneous, pulmonary, intestinal and septic form. All of them are manifested by an increase in body temperature, with damage to the lymphatic system. Mortality in the pulmonary-intestinal form is 80-100%. When the first signs of the disease appear, you must immediately contact the clinic at the place of attachment.

This year [2021], 6 cases of this dangerous infection were registered in Shymkent.

On [11 Nov 2021], it was reported that quarantine was introduced in one of the villages of the Kostanay region due to an outbreak of anthrax.

[Shymkent, is a city in Kazakhstan. It is near the border with Uzbekistan (120 km). It is one of 3 Kazakh cities which have a status equal to that of a region (the city of republican significance). It is the 3rd-most populous city in Kazakhstan, behind Almaty and Nur-Sultan. Until 2018, Shymkent was the administrative center of South Kazakhstan Region. On 19 Jun 2018, it was taken out of South Kazakhstan Region and subordinated directly to the government of Kazakhstan. As a result, the administrative center of the region is moved to Turkistan, and the region was renamed as Turkistan Region (for a map and further information go to Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shymkent).

Kazakhstan has been working hard over the past few decades to control anthrax and has largely succeeded. The present situation is but a fraction of what it was. To see their progress, read the following article, which has very useful maps, "Spatio-temporal analysis and visualisation of the anthrax epidemic situation in livestock in Kazakhstan over the period 1933-2016" at https://bit.ly/3HgDnBm. Until recently South Kazakhstan was rife with outbreaks but other than these outbreaks in 2021 [see also Anthrax - Kazakhstan (05): (SK) cattle, OIE 20210922.8695108] it was essentially absent since 2001.

Absence of disease outbreaks can result in a loss of caution. While the owner claims that his horse broke a leg. It was probably found moribund and was slaughtered, and then butchered. Horses are most often infected as a result of being bitten by a contaminated haemophagic tabanid fly. They are not vigorous grazers like cattle and do not browse like goats. I think we can presume that there have been a number of unreported unexpected deaths in the area, which had died from anthrax. Absence of reports is not the same as absence of disease.

Thanks again to Mahmoud for his forwarding of the incident. - Mod.MHJ
