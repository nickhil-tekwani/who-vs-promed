Detection of Sorghum yellow banding virus infecting grain sorghum in Venezuela
-------------------------------------------------
MJ Garrido and GE Trujillo, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Facultad de
Agronomia, Apartado 4579, Maracay 2101; and R Cuello, IVIC, Laboratorio de
Biotecnología y Virología Vegetal, Apartado 21827, Caracas 1020-A,
Venezuela. Plant Dis 2001; 85: 230, published online as D-2000-1214-01N,
2000. Accepted for publication 27 November 2000.
Naturally infected grain sorghum plants (_Sorghum bicolor_) in Maracay,
Aragua State, showed yellow speckles, streaks and bands with chlorosis,
stunting, and necrosis. A virus was mechanically transmitted to 3 to 10 per
cent of inoculated sorghum cvs. Atlas and Himeca-303 plants in the
greenhouse. The [inoculated plants] developed symptoms similar to those in
the field within 20 days after inoculation.
The virus infected a narrow range of gramineous species. It was not
transmitted by _Rhopalosiphum maidis_, _Schizaphis graminum_, _Peregrinus
maidis_, _Dalbulus maidis_, nor _Hortensia similis_ , nor by sorghum seed.
The virus was purified three times from fresh infected tissue giving yields
as high as 14.7 mg/100g. The A260 /A280 was 1.55. The virions were
isometric, 25 nm in diameter, and contained a single capsid protein with a
molecular weight of [about] 29 kDa. The virus was highly stable in sap. The
virus was not serologically related to eight small isometric viruses that
infect [species in the] Gramineae but did react in agar double-diffusion
tests with antiserum (supplied by RW Toler [Texas A&M Univ.]) to Sorghum
yellow banding virus (SYBV), a virus that affects sorghum and sorghum x
sudangrass hybrids in Texas and California (1).
Based on the above characteristics, the virus is considered to be SYBV.
This disease has not been found in other states in Venezuela. This is the
first report of SYBV infecting grain sorghum in Venezuela.

[SYBV has not been assigned a taxonomic position. It is to be hoped that
work leading to a fuller characterization of the virus is in progress. -
