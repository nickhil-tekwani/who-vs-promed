A teenager was rushed to Kratie [Kracheh] provincial hospital
yesterday [19 Oct 2011] after the application of a skin-whitening
cream left her unconscious, officials said, an incident that nearly
became the 2nd reported death in the Kingdom this year [2011] from
such a beauty product.

Sambor commune chief Touch Samboeum said that 19 year old victim began
vomiting and convulsing immediately after applying the cream, which
she had bought from a local market. "She is lucky, because her family
sent her immediately to the hospital for help. She is staying there
now for additional monitoring," he said.

The commune chief was unable to confirm whether the cream used by the
victim was the Vietnamese brand Kim Lot Lanh Thom Cao Cap, which was
banned from the Kingdom last year [2010] after its connection to the
death of a 23 year old in Banteay Meanchey province. "It is very
important for people to learn and be careful before using
skin-whitening creams in order to avoid adverse effects to their
health," he said.

Bun Chhoeun said that the current victim would be released from the
hospital after a few more days.

[Many ingredients are used in whitening cream, from mild
concentrations of bleach to mercury. However, this must have been
fairly potent or the victim must have applied a lot of it to have such
a strong reaction in what appears to have been a very short time. Such
a swift reaction would require rapid skin penetration, so it is likely
that the substance is quite lipid soluble.

It would be interesting to see what comes of this investigation and if
the cream applied was the one that was banned. - Mod.TG

The possibility also remains that the symptoms occurred for a reason
unrelated to the application of the cream. - Mod.SH
