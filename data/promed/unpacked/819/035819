Red tide returns to Florida region
-----------------------------------
Scientists at Mote Marine Laboratory announced the reemergence of red
tide in the area on Thursday [26 May 2005], just before the Memorial
Day holiday weekend.

According to Richard Pierce, director of Mote's Center for Ecotoxicology,
the effects of red tide are being felt along [the coasts of] Manatee and
Sarasota counties. Concentrations of the organism increased this week [4th
week May 2005] to high levels in New Pass and to moderate levels in other
areas of Sarasota Bay.

Wilma Katz of the Coastal Wildlife Club said she noticed a slight
[respiratory] irritation near Manasota Key earlier in the week, but not on
Thursday. "I felt that tickle," Katz said. Sporadic accounts of respiratory
irritation and dead fish were reported throughout the area, a Mote report
stated. "The weather forecast for the weekend calls for more westerly winds
that could intensify adverse effects of the bloom on shore," Pierce said.

Scientists discovered the season's biggest outbreak on 20 Dec 2004.
It stretched from Cedar Key to Clearwater. By 2 Feb 2005, it ranged
from Tarpon Springs to Englewood and about 50 miles into the Gulf. By
23 Feb 2005, it had expanded from northern Sarasota County to Fort
Myers, killing thousands of fish off Manasota Key. Mote reported the
bloom was gone by 30 Mar 2005.

At one point, the recent red tide contained more than 90 million red
tide cells per liter. According to Mote, the more cells per liter,
the more devastating the bloom's effects. The guidelines are:

* Fewer than 1000 cells per liter -- no effects;
* 5000 cells per liter -- shellfish harvesting closed;
* 10 000 cells per liter -- respiratory irritation;
* 50 000 cells per liter -- respiratory irritation and possible fish kills;
* More than 1 million cells per liter -- respiratory irritation, fish
kills and water discoloration.

The longest reported outbreak in Florida was in the Gulf of Mexico in
1994 and 1995. The highest concentration in that red tide was
measured at 300 million cells per liter.

Southwest Florida Gulf of Mexico
--------------------------------
The effects of a coastal red tide are once again being felt along the
Florida Gulf coast in Manatee and Sarasota Counties. Elevated levels
of red tide remained in Palma Sola Bay through April and May [2005].
A resurgence of red tide effects has been observed along the coast
from Anna Maria south to Englewood, with sporadic reports of
respiratory irritation and dead fish. Concentrations of the red tide
organism increased this week [4th week May 2005] to high levels in
New Pass and to moderate levels in other areas of the Bay.

Scientists from Mote and the Florida Wildlife Research Institute are
continuing to monitor the situation and have implemented research
into factors affecting dynamics of the bloom, adverse effects from
the toxins and ways to mitigate these effects. The weather forecast
for the weekend calls for more westerly winds that could intensify
adverse effects of the bloom on shore. It is important to note that,
as atmospheric and oceanic conditions change, algal bloom conditions
change as well, making forecasting very difficult.

Red Tide Current Status Report (27 May 2005)
Present Status: The current red tide bloom continues between lower
Tampa Bay and Sarasota Bay. Low concentrations of _Karenia brevis_,
the Florida red tide organism, were also found as far south as
Venice, indicating a slight southward trend in bloom movement. Fish
kills and respiratory irritation were reported from Longboat Key,
Siesta Key, Casey Key, and Englewood. Red tide effects are possible
along coastal beaches with onshore winds and in bay areas as long as
above-normal concentrations of _K. brevis_ remain.

Bloom Boundary North (alongshore): Manatee County
Bloom Boundary South (alongshore): Sarasota County
