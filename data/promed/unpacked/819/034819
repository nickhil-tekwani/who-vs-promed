In the article as posted, detection of the virus was successful in 6
of approximately 56 samples. While interesting, it simply isn't
statistically significant ... it would be nice to know how many
samples were actually tested.

Compared to the prevalence of herpes-type viruses in the general
population, it is possible that this is only a background finding,
unless the statistical tests prove a stronger link.

I do agree -- a treatment for this nasty disease would be invaluable,
and I hope this is a key to finding one!

[In the original article the authors report the isolation of a
previously uncharacterised simian herpesvirus from some animals in a
colony of Japanese macaques afflicted by a neurological condition
involving demyelinisation of neurons similar to that observed in human
multiple sclerosis. The evidence reported so far falls short of
confirming that this simian herpesvirus is the cause of the
demyelinisation in the affected animals, and in the past there have
been many false trails in attempts to associate virus infection (and
herpesvirus infection in particular) with human multiple sclerosis.
However, if the Oregon scientists can confirm such an association, at
the very least they will have discovered an experimental model which
would assist research into treatment of multiple sclerosis in humans.

[This interesting report raises some key questions. The researchers
are correct -- they have to go back to Koch's postulates, isolate the
virus, inoculate susceptibles and reproduce the disease so show that
the presence of the virus is not just a coincidence. The mention that
a herpesvirus -- herpesvirus encephalitis (similar to herpes B
infections in people?) -- has been detected is interesting. Nor is
there mention of in increase in antibodies in recently infected
individuals. The demyelinization might be an autoimmune response
induced by the virus infection. The possible relationship of the virus
with MS is premature, but worth following up. - Mod.TY]
