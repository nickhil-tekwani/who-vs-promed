In response to the moderator's commentary, we have begun to issue advice to
Canadian travellers going to plague endemic areas in the US whenever local
public health authorities issue plague alerts for the following reasons:
1. Many Canadian travellers go hiking, backpacking and camping in the US
and may increase their exposure to plague.
2. Canadians do not expect to encounter serious infectious disease,
especially plague, in the US while on vacation.

[Here is a good example of why suspect plague cases need to be reported as
soon as possible. It is not only visitors from Canada who go into US
wilderness areas without a thought that they might catch the plague. It is
not a satisfactory situation when countries have to rely on chance to pick
up news from "local public health authorities" - Mod.JW
