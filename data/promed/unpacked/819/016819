Three new cases of Haff disease were confirmed in Bahia, according to information from the State Health Department (Sesab). According to the agency, 21 cases were reported, 3 discarded, and 2 others are under investigation. No details were given about the municipalities where the new cases arose.

Historic
On 10 Sep [2021], Sesab had already confirmed 13 cases of the disease. Altogether, 16 cases were registered in 2021 in the state.

Haff's disease has the following symptoms:
- extreme muscle pain and stiffness,
- chest pain, in addition to shortness of breath,
- numbness and loss of strength throughout the body,
- which can cause kidney failure.

People with the disease have coffee-colored urine, caused by the elevation of the CPK enzyme, associated with the ingestion of fish.

[Haff's disease has a variety of symptoms. The variety can make diagnosis more complicated. History is clearly helpful. It is a challenging condition, as it has occurred with a variety of fish species, and in a variety of locations worldwide.

Some of the reported symptoms include
- muscle pain and stiffness
- light- to dark-brown urine
- nausea
- chest pain
- vomiting
- shortness of breath
- profuse sweating
- pain to light touch

Dry mouth, numbness of thighs or whole body, back pain, and stomach cramps are also reported, but less frequently.

Editorial note
---------------
"During the 1920s, the name 'Haff disease' was given to an illness characterized by severe muscle pain and stiffness that affected approximately 1000 persons living along the Koenigsberg Haff, a brackish inlet of the Baltic Sea (1). Subsequent similar outbreaks were identified in Sweden and the former Soviet Union (2-4). Although the etiology was not determined, epidemiologic investigations linked illness to ingestion of fish, especially burbot.

"The 1st reported case of Haff disease in the United States occurred in Texas in 1984 (M. Tormey, Los Angeles Department of Health Services, personal communication, 1997); 5 additional cases were reported in California during 1984-1986. All US cases have been associated with eating buffalo fish.

"Haff disease typically presents as a paroxysm of rhabdomyolysis, with accompanying muscle tenderness, rigidity, and dark-brown urine. However, . . . milder presentations also occur. Although the median incubation period for the patients . . . was 8 hours (range 6-21 hours), symptoms generally appear approximately 18 hours after eating fish.

"Laboratory features of Haff disease include a markedly elevated CK [creatine kinase] level with an MB fraction of less than 5%. Levels of other muscle enzymes (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase, glutamate oxalate transaminase, and glutamate pyruvate transaminase) also are elevated. Myoglobinuria is often mistaken for gross hematuria (5). Diagnosis is based on a compatible clinical history.

"Treatment is supportive and consists of administering large volumes of fluid early in the course of illness to prevent myoglobin toxicity to the renal tubules (5). Possible complications include electrolyte disturbances, renal failure, and disseminated intra-vascular coagulation. Symptoms usually resolve within 2-3 days. Historically, the case-fatality rate is approximately 1% (1).

"Clinicians and public health practitioners are encountering an increasing variety of foodborne illnesses, in part because of a diversification of food preparation and eating habits. International travelers, members of ethnic groups with unique cuisines, and consumers of both imported and domestic specialty food items may be at risk for foodborne illnesses that are rare or have not been reported previously in the United States. Clinicians should be aware of food exposures that pose a risk to their patients and routinely obtain food histories, even from those patients whose illness may not appear to be food related.

"Physicians who identify or suspect cases of Haff disease, based on the clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, and food history, should report them to public health authorities for initiation of traceback and recall of implicated food items. In the United States, State health departments are requested to report to the Foodborne and Diarrheal Diseases Branch, Division of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC.
