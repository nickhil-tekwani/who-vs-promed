For the 1st time, antibodies against Schmallenberg virus [SBV) have been found in Swedish cows. The discovery was made in 3 cows in Blekinge. The virus itself was not found in the cows, which did not show any clinical signs.

The virus has hit European countries and can lead to malformed or dead offspring in cows, sheep, and goats.

Serological testing of 650 dairy herds in southern Sweden has detected 3 animals with positive serological response (antibodies) against the virus.

The 3 animals are from the same herd, located in Blekinge. In a serological examination of sera from 600 sheep a positive serological reagent was found.

The results suggest that a small number of infected midges were introduced into Sweden in 2011 and infected some animals.

No distribution within the country or within herds has been seen and it is not likely that the infection could hibernate. The positive serological results are related to herds without clinical symptoms.

A map showing the distribution of the farms under SBV surveillance [the affected region is coloured light-brown] is available at http://www.sva.se/upload/Redesign2011/Bilder/Djurhalsa/F%C3%A5r%20och%20get/Schm-b_farserum-tryck.jpg.
