Tajikistan: Hepatitis A and B Reported in Kulob Area of Khatlon Province
---------------------------------------------------
Physicians in the area are seriously concerned over an increase in the
number of cases of hepatitis B in Kulob. 5 of 7 cases of hepatitis B have
been reported in the Farkhor District, one case has been reported in Kulob,
and one in the Muminobod District.
Since the beginning of 2003, 145 cases of hepatitis A have been recorded in
the Kulob area of Khatlon province, 91 cases fewer than for the same period
of 2002.
The Asia-Plus correspondent in Kulob was told at the Center for Sanitary
Control for the Kulob area that a major outbreak of hepatitis occurred in
Kulob in 2001, when 343 [received hospital treatment for the disease]. "The
actual number of people who contracted hepatitis was greater, but many of
those affected did not seek medical attention and relied on
self-treatment", a source at the Center told the Asia-Plus correspondent.
In 2002, according to the source, 335 cases of hepatitis were reported in
the region. The source also stated that, although the hepatitis [A]
situation in Baljuvon, Shurobod, Khovaling, and Sovet Districts has been
normalized, the worst-hit areas areas of the city are Kulob and the
Districts of Danghara, Vose, and Muminobod.

[The outbreaks of hepatitis A and B are unlikely to be related, since
hepatitis A virus is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and is usually
associated with contaminated food or water supplies, whereas hepatitis B
virus is readily spread by sexual intercourse, by intravenous drug use, and
by perinatal transmission from an infected mother.
Hepatitis A outbreaks are not uncommon in countries with poor infrastructure
and public health facilities. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted only in blood
and body fluids. Hepatitis A is an acute self-limiting infection, whereas
hepatitis B virus infection progresses to a persistent infection and
ultimately may result in serious liver damage and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Both diseases are vaccine-preventable where advanced health-care facilities
are available. - Mod.CP]
