Summer is when most people take advantage of the warm or hot weather and spend their days outdoors. It's also when ticks are at their most active and the number of tick borne diseases are at their highest.

Reports from just the last few years show around 3000 people come down with Rocky Mountain spotted fever every year. Doctors say the disease is treatable; but if caught too late, it can cause serious complications for patients.

These days, physical therapy sessions are all about improving balance and sometimes blowing off steam. "It's a fun workout to be able to take out a little frustration," a Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) patient said. His frustrations began 7 weeks ago after he came home from a hunting trip and came down with a fever.

"I kind of had a headache and just didn't feel very good," he said. He said he went to several doctors and was told he had the flu and pneumonia by 2 different physicians, but his fever only got worse. He says he never thought to bring up his recent hunting trip because he never actually found a tick on him and didn't feel the bite.

One morning he woke up confused and incoherent. "I was able to manage to get him in the car but it was really scary. I had never seen anybody that sick before that they couldn't talk right," his wife said.

The patient then spent the next month in the hospital. He says he doesn't remember the 1st 3 weeks. "He would have periods where he was awake but his eyes were glassy staring off into space," his wife added.

When he finally came to, the wife said she told him what doctor's believed he had. She says they suspected it as soon as he was admitted because he had developed a rash and had recently been in the woods. She said it took weeks for the test results to come back and confirm the diagnosis.

"When I told him in the hospital for the 1st time that he had Rocky Mountain spotted fever from a tick bite he could not believe it, he just could not believe it," the wife said.

Doctors say the disease is not contagious and can only be caught if you're bitten by an infected tick.

"If you look at how many people will be bitten by ticks -- lots of people will be bitten by ticks -- especially if you're outdoors person in tall grass, wooded areas things like that, but the number of people who get bitten by ticks and go on to have the disease is pretty rare," Dr. Gretchen Dickson, Assistant Professor at KU School of Medicine-Wichita, said.

The McHenry County Department of Health is asking people to protect themselves from tick bites after a Woodstock woman was hospitalized with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Officials don't know where the 53-year-old woman got the tick bite, and her serious condition prevents her from speaking, health department spokeswoman Debra Quackenbush said. She would not elaborate on the woman's condition, citing privacy laws.

The last reported case of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in McHenry County was in 2008.

"We are letting people know that ticks are everywhere," Quackenbush said. "They can be in a field or in an empty lot. They hang around on tall grass, waiting for someone to come by so they can hitch a ride. They don't jump at you, you have to brush by where they're at. When you brush by, they will latch on.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the 1st symptoms typically begin 2 to 14 days after the bite of an infected tick. Typical symptoms include: fever, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, and muscle pain. A rash may also develop, but is often absent in the 1st few days, and in some patients, never develops.

People should wear light-colored clothing to make ticks easier to find. Long pants are recommended. People should do full-body tick checks, including in their ears, behind the knees and in their hair. They should also check their pets and any gear taken on outings. The CDC also recommends bathing or showering as soon as possible after coming indoors.

"I never saw a tick on her," says the woman said. So when her 4-year-old daughter came down with this rash, her mom didn't think anything of it. "I told her to give her some Benadryl, put some cream on it -- it won't be a big deal," she said.

But when the rash didn't disappear, they called the doctor who didn't have an answer. "Me and my husband were freaking out because not knowing is worse than knowing," the mother added.

The rash was Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The girl was the victim of a tick. But she's not alone. This summer the rare disease has popped up several times in Madison County.

"It's not very common, but when it happens it can be pretty serious," says Dr. Tammy Tucker, a family practice physician.

The Arkansas Department of Health says the mild winter and extra hot summer could be to blame for the increase in ticks, and the number of Rocky Mountain spotted fever cases.

[It cannot be stressed enough that early recognition of this disease is quite important in minimizing morbidity and mortality. This is especially true in areas of the USA where the infection is not as classically known such as those outside the northwestern "Rocky Mountain" states as well as the Middle Atlantic states.

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, fever, muscle pains, headache (the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric involving the palms and soles as well as spreading proximally to the trunk. Purpura usually is not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.

In a recent article (Dahlgren FS, Holman RC, Paddock CD, Callinan LS, McQuiston JH: Fatal Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the United States, 1999-2007. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2012;86: 713-719) it was reported that despite increasing reporting of RMSF, no significant changes occurred in the estimated number of fatalities. Risk factors for mortality included children 5-9 years of age, being Native American, adults greater than 70 years old and immunosuppression. In part, all of these factors may be related to delayed consideration of this diagnosis.

The female _Dermacentor variabilis_ (the American dog tick), a common vector for this infection, can be seen at http://bugguide.net/images/cache/3K9RLQWRIQTQU0L0P0K020H0P0Z020CQFKCRMQL0XQH0IQZ0U0R0W0Z0U0Q0IQTRIQOR7QYRP0JRXQS0G0OQX0VR.jpg.
