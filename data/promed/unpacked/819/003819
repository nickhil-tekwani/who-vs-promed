The head of the pediatrics department at Ibn Al-Jazzar Hospital in Kairouan, Hussein Al-Majoul, stated that 29 cases of infection with the "bronchiolitis virus" [respiratory syncytial virus were recorded in children and infants, and they are currently in the children's department at Ibn Al-Jazzar Hospital in Kairouan.

He added, in a statement to the Tunis Afrique News Agency, yesterday [6 Jan 2023], that among these cases, there are 2 infants under 6 months of age who are undergoing artificial respiration, and 12 cases in the resuscitation department to receive "intensive oxygen." He described the condition of the rest of the cases as "stable" and they are currently receiving the necessary treatment.

He confirmed that the region witnessed 2 weeks ago a wave of infections with the "bronchiolitis" virus, pointing out that the number of infections is seeing a gradual increase during this period, as between 160 and 200 imported cases suffering from respiratory diseases, including bronchitis and bronchiolitis, were recorded in the emergency department of Ibn Al-Jazzar Hospital."

Al-Majoul considered that this wave was expected, but "it was not as severe as it is now, as serious cases have been recorded, especially among infants whose age does not exceed 6 months."

And he noted that the [COVID-19] pandemic period and respect for prevention measures by using masks for children and sterile materials contributed to the decline of many bacterial diseases, but returning to normal and reducing preventive measures contributed to the spread of cases of infection with the bronchiolitis virus.

And he stressed the need to follow preventive measures by constantly cleaning the child's nose with saline solution "physiol", using masks, not kissing infants, especially by an infected person, ventilating the rooms, and not smoking inside the house, and also stressed the need not to acquire anti-inflammatory or antibiotics from pharmacies for the child or infant without consulting a pediatrician because it may contribute to the seriousness of his condition.

Abstract
--------
"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main cause of severe respiratory infections in young children. The need for global epidemiologic data regarding RSV has been increasingly recognized. RSV A infections are reported more frequently than RSV B. Nonetheless, the temporal distribution of infections caused by both RSV groups has not been investigated globally. A systematic review was carried out regarding published studies on RSV A and B epidemiology, as well as RSV G gene ectodomain sequence data available at GenBank. A total of 76 668 [45 990 (60%) RSV A and 30 678 (40%) RSV B] positive samples from 83 countries were identified and included in the analysis. Genotype assignment was obtained in 5340 RSV A and 2518 RSV B sequences. 2 patterns of RSV circulation were observed: continuous seasons with RSV A predominance and alternate predominance of RSV A and B. These patterns were observed in all regions, but the predominant RSV group seldom coincided in all continents during a given year or season. The most frequently identified RSV A genotype was NA1 (including ON1 viruses) (76.30%), and the most frequently identified RSV B genotype was BA (70.65%). Multiple genotypes circulated simultaneously throughout the evolutionary history of RSV, but genotype diversity decreased after the year 2000. The classification of RSV group and genotype is important for the development of vaccines, as well as to understand viral dynamics. This study displays the global and continental RSV circulation patterns from the first report of human RSV infection until the end of 2020."
