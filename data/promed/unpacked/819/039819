The above posting [California encephalitis, equine - USA (Louisiana)
20001028.1883 seems nonsensical to me. There are more holes in it than in
a Swiss cheese.
1. The title of the piece "First Cases of California encephalitis in
Equines in Louisiana" is not borne out by the report. There is no evidence
presented that either horse died of encephalitis, only that one died (of
something) and the other is "presumed dead". Indeed, Martin Hugh-Jones
rightly indicated that "As this is serology on single blood samples, it can
only be regarded as presumptive, however persuasive". Agreed, presumptive
at best, and not very persuasive to me.
2. The term "California encephalitis" means encephalitis caused by a
California serogroup virus (family Bunyaviridae, genus _Bunyavirus_). The
etiologic agent of such an illness can be any of the many viruses in this
serogroup, including the group prototype California encephalitis virus (not
known to occur in Louisiana), snowshoe hare virus (not known to occur in
Louisiana), and others, including La Crosse virus, which has been isolated
from mosquitoes in Louisiana and which causes rare human illnesses there.
No evidence is presented that either horse died with encephalitis or that
they died of a California serogroup virus infection. "CE" (should be "CEV")
is the abbreviation for "California encephalitis virus" and there is no
evidence that this is the etiologic agent.
3. Whatever confirmation CDC did, it was not confirming of the
encephalitis, only of the serologic results (and I have my doubts about
them as well; vide infra).
4. According to the table, horse 1 had IgM and IgG antibodies to eastern
equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis (does not occur in
Louisiana; its equivalent, Highlands J virus does occur there), "CE" (no
laboratories are currently using California encephalitis virus for routine
serologic screening, so this must mean La Crosse virus (and should have
said so), and St. Louis encephalitis viruses. Does anyone believe that this
horse was infected with all these viruses? Why choose "CE" as the likely
etiologic agent? Because the titer was highest? These results appear to be
nonspecific, in part at the very least. Why are IgG titers of 128 (who
makes such dilutions for IgG assays?) to be ignored? Why are IgM titers of
256 and 512 (who makes such dilutions for IgM assays?) to be ignored?
Likely because they are just as nonspecific as the titers to "CE" virus.
Horse 2 was negative for IgM antibody; IgG titers of 64 were ignored? Why?
Likely because they were justifiably considered nonspecific. I understand
that CDC tested these samples by neutralization and that indeed they did
neutralize La Crosse virus at higher titer than to other California
serogroup viruses. Harvey Artsob and his coworkers have shown a correlation
between antibody to snowshoe hare virus and encephalitis in horses in
Canada and the Finns have shown a correlation between antibody to Inkoo
virus (also a member of the California serogroup) and disease in large
mammals. No doubt this can occur (lots of serologic evidence of infection
but not of illness of large mammals with California serogroup viruses).
However, one seropositive, even if truly seropositive, does not a diagnosis
make, any more than one sample with antibody makes a "case".
If one is sufficiently naive and ignorant as to believe that a single
seropositive must indicate a seroconversion because that animal must have
been seronegative at some point before that, there is no hope for obtaining
accurate, reasonable, measured, and reliable serodiagnoses. We seem to be
approaching that point.
ProMED-mail might have better trashed this posting and done a greater
service to its readers.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Calisher for setting the record straight on this
issue. Clearly there has been more than a bit of confusion in the
interpretation of the serologic testing to which Dr. Calisher refers. It
may well be that by posting this thread, the net effect will be that there
will be an improvement in the understanding of these issues, by both those
who perform serologic testing and those who receive these results. As with
many of Dr. Calisher's comments for ProMED-mail in the past, it is
scientific accuracy which he uncompromisingly demands. We depend upon the
critical comments of our readership to ensure that the information provided
by ProMED-mail is of the highest quality. We receive reports that vary
greatly in scientific content, and we attempt to provide informed comments.
When we do not do so, we look to the expertise of our readers to assist us.
