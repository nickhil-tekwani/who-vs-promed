New South Wales (NSW) Health is warning residents of the Hunter Valley to take extra precautions to prevent the spread of a mosquito-borne disease.

Dr David Durrheim, a public health physician with Hunter New England (HNE) Health said the Kunjin virus has been detected in horses across NSW, including the Hunter Valley.

Dr Durrheim said the detections indicate Kunjin may be circulating in mosquitoes and the virus has potential to cause human infection.

"It is important to be vigilant about protecting yourself from mosquito bites as mosquitoes can spread Kunjin and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses," Dr Durrheim said.

NSW Health said Kunjin and Murray Valley encephalitis virus infections are 2 "rare but serious infections of the brain which can cause symptoms such as severe headache, neck stiffness, sensitivity to bright lights, drowsiness, confusion, and possible seizures."

"There is no vaccine and no specific treatment for these viruses," Dr Durrheim said.

"The best way to avoid infection is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes." To avoid mosquito bites, NSW Health advised covering up as much as possible when outside and wearing light-coloured, loose-fitting clothing, and covered footwear.

NSW Health recommended the use of an effective mosquito repellent and reapply repellent within a few hours, as protection wears off with perspiration. "The best mosquito repellents contain diethyltoluamide (DEET), picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus," NSW Health said.

NSW Health also said covering windows and doors with insect screens, removing uncovered water-holding containers from outside where mosquitoes can breed, and using insecticide spray and mosquito coils can assist in avoiding bites.

According to NSW Health, Kunjin virus disease is a viral infection caused by a flavivirus (Kunjin virus) found in mainland Australia and Papua New Guinea and is closely related to West Nile virus which is found in Africa, Europe, and the USA.

[Kunjin virus is endemic in Australia and human and equine infections occur there sporadically. With Kunjin virus infections in equine animals across New South Wales currently, there is a health risk for humans and equine animals.

"Clinical signs may include depression and mild colic. These may also include the onset of neurological signs including increased responsiveness to touch and sound, facial paralysis, difficulty masticating, hypermetria in forelimbs and weakness in hindquarters, general ataxia, and/or recumbency. Most of the horses involved appear to be recovering slowly, however there have also been reports of a few deaths," said Dr Smith (see Kunjin/Barmah Forest/Ross River viruses - Australia (02): background 20100416.1228)

Kunjin virus (KUN), a subtype of West Nile virus, was first isolated in Australia in 1960 from mosquitoes (_Culex annulirostris_). The virus is named for an Aboriginal clan living on the Mitchell River in Kowanyama, northern Queensland. Most cases of human infection are reported in Australia, with sporadic reports from Nepal. In Australia, Kunjin virus infection is more widely distributed than another flavivirus disease, Murray Valley encephalitis. The yearly incidence varies from 0-to-9 cases per year.

Kunjin (KUN) is reported in most of tropical Australia, eastern Queensland, and occasionally southeastern Australia. The disease appears to have been responsible for some reports of "Murray Valley encephalitis" in 1974 and was implicated in an additional sporadic case in northern Victoria in 1984. A presumptive case of KUN was reported in Pilbara, Western Australia in 1997. In 2000, the disease reappeared in Central Australia, where it had last been documented in 1974. During 1992 to 2010, 13 cases were reported in Northern Territory, and an outbreak of Kunjin virus encephalitis was reported among horses in New South Wales in 2011 and a suspected human case in the Northern Territory in 2021. The principal mosquito vectors for Kunjin virus are _Culex annulirostris_, _Cu. pseudovishnui_, and _Cu. squamosis_. _Aedes albopictus_ has been identified as a potential vector for Kunjin virus in Australia (see Kunjin virus - Australia (02): (NT) background 20190403.6403071). - Mod.TY
