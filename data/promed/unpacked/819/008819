The Brazos County (Texas) Health Department is investigating 8 cases of possible _E. coli_ infections in the area. With the help of the Texas Department of State Health, the department has confirmed that 5 of those cases are due to _E. coli_ O157:H7, a strain of the bacterium that produces a Shiga toxin, which can cause bloody diarrhea and lead to kidney failure and hemolytic uremic syndrome, which has a fatality rate of between 5 and 10 percent.

Two related children, under the age of 5, have been hospitalized for about a week at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. The other 6 patients, who were college-aged or older, did not need hospitalization, according to department Health Authority Eric Wilke.

Investigators have yet to find a common source of the bacteria among the recent patients, as the patients did not eat at the same restaurant, Wilke said.
