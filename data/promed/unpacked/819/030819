[Since the start of the current rabies outbreak in Northern Greece, after the reported absence of the disease for 25 years, 5 rabid animals have been reported -- 2 in Western Macedonia (a red fox on 15 Oct 2012 and a dog on 10 Nov 2012, and 3 cases in Central Macedonia (red foxes on 29 Nov 2012 and 6 Dec 2012, and a sheepdog on 14 Dec 2012). The 2 affected provinces border Albania on the west and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the north, both regarded as rabies-endemic territories. A map showing the locations of the 5 cases, (2 in Western Macedonia and 3 in Central Macedonia) is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000012756_20121221_122728.pdf.

Greece's rabies surveillance plan, established after discussions and consultation with the European Commission and under implementation since early 2012, was presented during the 5-6 Nov 2012 meeting of the EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH). The presentation is available at http://tinyurl.com/cur4jqd; it covers also the 1st detected case, which involved a red fox in Greece's Western Macedonia on 15 Oct 2012. Since then, 4 additional cases have been confirmed by laboratory. - Mod.AS
