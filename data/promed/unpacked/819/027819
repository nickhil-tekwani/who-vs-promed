More than 200 tested for West Nile virus in New York
--------------------------------------------
State health officials said more than 200 ailing New Yorkers have been
tested this year for the potentially deadly West Nile virus, without a
single positive result. But results are pending on many more cases,
including a 71-year-old South Carolina man who died Wednesday on Staten
Island. Mosquito-fighting efforts have been intensified, with Rockland
County deciding to join Suffolk, Westchester and New York City in spraying
insecticide.
The man who died had been in New York only two days before getting ill on
July 4, and city officials said that made West Nile unlikely because it
usually takes five days for symptoms to appear. But his symptoms put
doctors on alert.
The virus, which killed seven people in the New York area last year, has
been discovered this year in more than two dozen birds and in mosquitoes.
Hospitals have been asked to send blood specimens from any patient with
symptoms similar to West Nile's: muscle aches, stiff neck and flu-like
symptoms. To date, of 208 people tested, all have turned up negative.
The West Nile virus, transmitted by mosquitoes, is commonly found in
Africa, Eastern Europe, West Asia and the Middle East. Its appearance in
the New York area was its first in the Western Hemisphere, and it prompted
a massive campaign of aerial and ground spraying to kill mosquitoes.
At a conference in Atlanta on Wednesday, scientists warned that West Nile
could be the first of a new generation of deadly outbreaks caused by
increased world travel.They said only intense cooperation among public
health officials, hospitals, veterinarians and the media kept West Nile
from being exponentially worse [?. And they said they feared other
American cities would be ill-equipped to handle such an epidemic.
