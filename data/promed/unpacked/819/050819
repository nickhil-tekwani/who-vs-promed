Seven positive measles cases reported in Tarlac
-----------------------------------------------
The Department of Health (DOH) field [in Tarlac City] has reported 7
positive cases of measles in the province. DOH-Tarlac head Luz Lopez said 5
cases came from Barangay [barrio, the smallest administrative division in
the Philippines] Matatalaib in this city and one each from the towns of
Concepcion and Bamban. Lopez said a total of 16 cases were reported to
their office but only 7 were positive after testing of serum.

She said one of the patients in Barangay Matatalaib was brought to the
Tarlac provincial hospital due to fever and cold, but the patient was later
on confirmed as a measles case. Through this patient, she said, the DOH and
the Tarlac provincial health office have learned that there were other
cases of measles in the said barangay. "We immediately sent a surveillance
team to the area and the report was confirmed," she said.

These measles cases ranged from 7 to 16 years old. The DOH field office
[determined] that the victims have been vaccinated previously with
anti-measles immunization. However, Ma. Noel B Lim, a DOH representative
said that [prior anti-measles vaccination] was not a 100 per cent guarantee
that you will not become [re-infected]. Lim also said that school children
and students were very vulnerable to measles.

She urged teachers to look out for children who showed symptoms of fever,
cold, cough, and conjunctivitis . It is advisable to isolate such children
and [recommend] parents to have their children checked-up right away, she
said. Lim also said that prisons and jails were also very vulnerable due to
the hot weather and congestion. She said that there was a big possibility
also that more cases of measles would be reported to their office because
of the strict monitoring [now in place].

[Subsequent to the successful Ligtas Tigdas 2004 campaign (a door-to-door
campaign, whereby vaccination teams led by doctors, nurses, and midwives
visited homes and schools to vaccinate children against measles during the
month of February 2004), when 100 per cent of children in the Philippines
in the age group 9 months to 7 years were thought to have been vaccinated,
no measles cases were reported from June 2004 to December 2006 [see
previous post]. The detection of measles cases in Tarlac, reported to have
been vaccinated previously, suggests there had been imperfections in
previous vaccination campaigns. Subsequent relaxation of controls has been
accompanied by a recent reemergence of measles in the Philippines. This
report now extends the number of provinces affected by measles to at least
5: Cavite, Manila, Lanao del Sur, Quezon, and Tarlac).
