A 5-month-old baby died of leishmaniasis on Monday (24 Oct 2016) in the Municipal Hospital Governador Valadares. The child was hospitalized last weekend [22-23 Oct 2016?] and was undergoing treatment. This is the 1st death due to leishmaniasis in the city [Governador Valadares, Minas Gerais state] in 2016. In the same hospital, a 2-year-old was also hospitalized, diagnosed with visceral leishmaniasis.

According to the Municipality Office of Communication, this year [2016] there were 15 cases of leishmaniasis reported in humans. In 2015, there were 17 cases and 2 deaths reported due to leishmaniasis.

[A recent study from Minais Gerais by Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte (1) found that the main vectors were _Lutzomyia longipalpis_ (35.3 percent), _Lutzomyia cortelezzii_ (33.5 percent) and _Lutzomyia whitmani_ (18.3 percent). The seroprevalence in dogs was 5.8 percent and the main Leishmania subspecies were _Leishmania infantum_ and _Leishmania braziliensis_.

Reports of visceral leishmaniasis in children are rare. We suppose the 2 children reported here were HIV-negative. A large study from Brazil included 166 pregnant women, of which 25 were Leishmania seropositive. None of the children born to seropositive mothers developed Leishmania during the 18 months post partum follow up period. Two children born to seronegative women developed visceral leishmaniasis at 9 and 12 months of age respectively.

Thus, it is most likely that the 2 children reported here acquired the Leishmania infection after birth.
