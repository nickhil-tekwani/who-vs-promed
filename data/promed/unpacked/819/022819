Ebola Reston in pigs and humans in the Philippines
--------------------------------------------------
On 23 Jan 2009, the Government of the Philippines announced that a
person thought to have come in contact with sick pigs had tested
positive for Ebola Reston Virus (ERV) antibodies (IgG). On 30 Jan
2009 the Government announced that a further 4 individuals had been
found positive for ERV antibodies: 2 farm workers in Bulacan and one
farm worker in Pangasinan -- the 2 farms currently under quarantine
in northern Luzon because of ERV infection was found in pigs -- and
one butcher from a slaughterhouse in Pangasinan. The person announced
on 23 Jan 2009 to have tested positive for ERV antibodies is reported
to be a backyard pig farmer from Valenzuela City, a neighbourhood
within Metro Manila.

The Philippine Department of Health has said that the people who
tested positive appear to be in good health and have not suffered
from any significant illnesses in the past 12 months. The
investigation team reported that it was possible that all 5
individuals had been exposed to the virus as a result of direct
contact with sick pigs. The use of personal protective equipment
(PPE) is not common practice among these animal handlers.

From these observations and previous studies of ERV, the virus has
shown it can be transmitted to humans, without resulting in illness.
However, the evidence available relates only to healthy adults and it
would be premature to conclude the health effects of the virus on all
population groups. The threat to human health is likely to be low for
healthy adults but is unknown for all other population groups, such
as immuno-compromised persons, persons with underlying medical
conditions, pregnant women and children.

The Philippine Government is conducting contact tracing in relation
to the 5 individuals who tested positive for antibodies. In addition,
testing is ongoing for other persons who could have come into contact
with sick pigs on the 2 quarantined farms in the provinces of Bulacan
and Pangasinan where pigs co-infected with the Porcine Respiratory
and Reproductive Syndrome (PRRS) and ERV were reported in 2008. The 2
farms remain under quarantine and the Philippine Government is
maintaining its voluntary hold of exports of live pigs and fresh and
frozen pork meat.

The Philippine Government has announced a combined Department of
Health and Department of Agriculture strategy to limit the animal and
human health risks of the Ebola Reston Virus and emphasized that
local governments, the pig farming industry and the public will play
a critical role in the strategy.

Along with its international partners, the WHO will continue to
support the Philippine Government in its efforts to gain a better
understanding of the Ebola Reston virus, its effects on humans, and
the measures that need to be taken to reduce any risks to human health.
