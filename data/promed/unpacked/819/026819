CDC reports 1st case of measles in 2011, 467 at risk
----------------------------------------------------
Although the measles, mumps and rubella [MMR] vaccine has been widely
administered [in Taiwan] since 1978, there are still parts of the
population that are not vaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) on Wed 9 Feb 2011 reported the 1st case of measles this year
[2011] and has so far put 467 people on a watch list for further
follow-ups to prevent widespread infection.

The measles patient is a 28 year old Swiss man who is currently a
student at a college in the north of the country. He is suspected of
having contracted measles overseas. He admitted himself for emergency
treatment at a hospital on Thursday last week [3 Feb 2011], CDC deputy
director-general Lin Ting said. Because the emergency ward at the time
was filled with hundreds of patients and their family members, as well
as nurses, doctors and other emergency medical staff, the number of
people that the measles patient potentially came in contact with and
could have infected was as many as 467 people, the CDC said.

Among the people who are in danger of contracting measles from the
student are 8 infants who were at the hospital at the time and are at
higher risk of developing a serious illness. All 467 people have been
put on a watch list for health officials to follow up for treatment,
if necessary, to stop the case developing into a widespread
infection.

Although the MMR vaccine has been widely administered to infants and
young children since 1978, there are still parts of the population
that have not been vaccinated and therefore do not have immunity
against the disease, the CDC said. Measles is a highly infectious,
airborne disease that can even be contracted [for example] by entering
an elevator in which a measles patient was recently present and one
measles patient often infects as many as 12 to 18 people, Lin said.

Symptoms of the disease include coughing, high fever, runny nose, red
eyes and a red rash for between a week and 10 days. Those who have
recently traveled to India, China and other high-risk countries are at
a higher risk of contracting the disease [if unprotected by MMR
vaccination]. The CDC said that those who have developed such symptoms
should put on a face mask, avoid using public transport and visit a
hospital immediately.

[Normally people who suspect they have contracted measles virus
infection are instructed not to visit medical facilities unannounced
to avoid contact with potentially susceptible members of the general
public. In the situation described above the patient was inadvertently
admitted to a public emergency ward before measles virus infection had
been diagnosed. It is unclear in this incident why the emergency ward
at the time was filled with hundreds of patients and their family
members, as well as emergency medical staff. Hopefully there will be
few unprotected by MMR vaccination.
