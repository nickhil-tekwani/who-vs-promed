Cases of cholera imported to Germany from Kenya
Four tourists who had visited Kenya with their families returned to Germany
with cholera and were reported to the Robert Koch-Institut in January 1998.
The cases were men aged 47 to 58 years, who lived in three different
laender - Baden-Wuerttemberg, Hamburg, and North Rhine-Westphalia (in two
different districts). They all returned to Germany between 27 December 1997
and 1 January 1998 after spending one to four weeks in Kenya where they had
stayed in three different hotels in the coastal region around Mombasa and
had also made trips inland. Three of the cases became ill in Kenya, with
violent diarrheae, dehydration and hypovolaemic shock. The fourth man
developed symptoms after return. All four were admitted to hospital. The
clinical diagnosis of cholera was verified by the identification of _Vibrio
cholerae_ O 1. The cases' home environments and families have been
investigated but transmission of infection to contacts has not been
observed.
The strains were typed at the national reference centre for salmonellas and
other enteric bacterial pathogens at the Hygiene Institut Hamburg (Prof Dr
J Bockemuehl). Three of the strains were of biotype el tor, serotype ogawa
(the fourth strain was not available for typing). The three strains were
resistant to the vibriostatic agent O 129, and against ampicillin,
cephazolin, cotrimoxazole, chloramphenicol, and sulphonamides. They were
sensitive to tetracycline and ofloxacin.
