Foot and mouth disease in Bolivia: Follow-up report No. 2
---------------------------------------------------------
Translation of information received on 7 Aug 2003 from Dr Marcelo Lara
Godoy, National Head of Animal Health, Servicio Nacional de Sanidad
Agropecuaria (SENASAG), Trinidad:
End of previous report period: 23 Jul 2003
End of this report period: 7 Aug 2003.
New outbreaks:
Location / No. of outbreaks
17 deg 12 min S - 67 deg 48 min W (La Paz Department) / 1
16 deg 14 min S - 68 deg 13 min W (La Paz Department) / 1
Description of affected population in the new outbreaks: the outbreaks
occurred in periurban areas where the animal population consists mainly of
bovine and ovine species with a family-run rearing system.
Total number of animals in the new outbreaks:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
bov / 19 / 16 / 0 / 0 / 0
ovi / 40 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
sui / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Veterinary Research and Diagnostic
Laboratory (LIDIVET: Laboratorio de Investigacion y Diagnostico Veterinario).
B. Diagnostic tests used: ELISA 3 ABC and virus typing.
C. Causal agent: foot and mouth disease virus serotype O.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent/origin of infection: movement of animals from the
departments of Chuquisaca and Potosi, where the disease occurred 4 weeks ago.
B. Other epidemiological details: the outbreaks occurred in periurban
areas, where rearing is very limited. The plots where the animals are kept
do not exceed 240 sq m, and the animals are therefore very easy to control.
Control measures during reporting period:
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- screening;
- vaccination;
- zoning.

[Typically, 16 of the 19 bovines (84 percent) presented clinical disease,
compared with none of the 40 ovines in contact with these bovines. This
might mean that cattle have served as sentinels, while sheep could have
undergone subclinical infection. Such a scenario could be ruled out -- or
confirmed -- by serological or virological investigations. - Mod.AS]
