A further 68 000 birds are being slaughtered on a 6th poultry farm in
Suffolk in a bid to control the outbreak of bird flu in the region. DEFRA
officials say the latest cull -- more than double the other 5 combined --
is precautionary and falls within the existing surveillance zone. The move
comes amid fears that workers at the farm have travelled to other farms
that are deemed a flu risk.

More than 28 600 turkeys, ducks and geese have already been slaughtered.
Acting chief veterinary officer Fred Landeg said the move is based on new
information about exposure risk and stressed that all poultry keepers must
immediately report any signs of the disease.

A spokeswoman at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(DEFRA) said the latest farm is owned by the same company that operates
Redgrave Park Farm near Diss, on the Norfolk-Suffolk border, where the
virus was 1st detected earlier this month [November 2007].

The spokeswoman said employee routes between the farms are being monitored
for signs of the disease spreading. A 3 km protection zone and 10 km
surveillance zone were immediately set up, and remain in place. The 6th
cull will include 56 000 ducks, 9000 turkeys and 3000 geese. Bird flu has
been confirmed at both the original site of the outbreak and one other
nearby site owned by the same company. The latest premises to be added to
the cull list supplied poultry to the farm at the centre of the outbreak,
but this latest move is more linked to employee movement, the spokeswoman said.

On Tuesday [20 Nov 2007], it was confirmed that turkeys culled at 2 other
farms over fears they had been exposed to the disease tested negative.
These were Stone House, in West Harling, and Bridge Farm, in Pulham, both
in Norfolk.

On Monday [19 Nov 2007], tests showed birds at Hill Meadow Farm in
Knettishall on the Norfolk/Suffolk border had been infected with H5N1, a
strain of the virus at the centre of fears that it may mutate and cause an
epidemic among humans.

Another of the farms, Grove Farm, Botesdale, Suffolk was upgraded to a
slaughter site on suspicion of having the disease last week, after dozens
of birds were found dead by officials. But initial tests on 5500 turkeys
slaughtered found the premises were free of disease.

A Yemeni official said on Wed 21 Nov 2007 that authorities were testing
farm chickens after reports about the death of poultry in several parts of
the country. "We received several reports from farmers during the past few
days about the death of birds," Ghalib al-Eryani of the Agriculture
Ministry told the official Saba news agency.

He said concerns were high that the birds were infected by the deadly H5N1
strain of bird flu virus. "Procedures have been taken to combat the strain,
and imports from infected countries were banned," the official said.

Al-Eryani said teams were sent to poultry farms to make necessary tests.
Neighboring Saudi Arabia has culled more than 200 000 birds since
mid-November 2007 after the outbreak of the deadly H5N1 virus in a central
region of the kingdom.

Preliminary testing of a little egret found in Tuen Mun has indicated a
suspected H5 avian flu case, the Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation
Department says. This is the 1st wild bird suspected to be infected by the
virus at the onset of this winter season [2007-2008].

The bird was collected in Tuen Mun Park 18 Nov 2007 and died the next day.
There are no chicken farms within 3 km of where the bird was found. Poultry
farmers have been reminded to take precautionary and biosecurity measures
against bird flu. Farmers, pet bird shop owners, pet poultry license
holders, and racing pigeon owners have been informed to take proper
precautions.

The department will inspect poultry farms and the wholesale market to
ensure proper precautions against bird flu have been implemented. Close
surveillance of wild birds will continue. While vigilance over imported
poultry and live poultry stalls will continue, illegal poultry and bird
imports will be deterred and health education bolstered.

As the threat of avian flu remains, people should take precautions against
the disease. For more details, see
