On Wed, 3 Jan 2006, information was received about suspected clinical cases
of FMD in 2- to 4-month-old calves in Kibbutz Mevo-Hamma. Samples have been
taken, tested by the national FMD laboratory in the Kimron Veterinary
Institute and found today [Thu, 4 Jan 2007] positive for FMD virus serotype
O1. The feedlot of Kibbutz Mevo-Hamma and an area of 10 km radius around it
have been declared infected zones and put under severe animal movements
restrictions.

[Kibutz Mevo-Hamma is situated on the southeastern side of the Sea of
Galilee (Lake Kinneret), 5 km from the Jordanian border (Yarmuk River) and
12 km from the Syrian border; see square 3 in the interactive map at
<http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html>. The distance from
Netu'a and Zarit, where FMD cases have been reported earlier this week in
goats, is approximately 60 km.
Calves at the above age may have lost their maternal immunity while
awaiting their own vaccination.
Further clinical and epidemiological information is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
