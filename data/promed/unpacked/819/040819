The [UK] Health Protection Agency (HPA) is providing expert support
and advice to the National Public Health Service (NPHS) for Wales
after an H7N2 avian influenza infection was found in birds on a small
farm in north Wales.
The Agency has carried out tests on specimens from 9 people
associated with the incident; 7 were from Wales and 2 were from
northwest England. Of the test results, 4 were positive -- 2 from
Wales and 2 from northwest England. The remaining 5 test results came
back negative. However, because these 5 cases were associated with
the birds and had a compatible illness, they are being treated as a precaution.
H7N2 is a low pathogenic strain of avian flu. It is different to the
highly pathogenic H5N1 strain currently circulating in Southeast
Asia, and in Europe last year [2006]. In almost all human cases to
date, H7N2 infection has generally been associated with a mild
disease. The risk to the general public is considered to be very low.
Pat Troop, Chief Executive of the Health Protection Agency said, "As
a routine precaution, we have tested those who were associated with
the infected or dead birds and reported flu-like symptoms. We tested
samples from 9 people in our laboratories and confirmed infection in
4. These test results confirm that human infection with the avian flu
virus has occurred. The cases so far have been associated with the
infected birds. It is important to remember that H7N2 avian flu
remains largely a disease of birds." The virus does not transmit
easily to humans. Worldwide, almost all human H7N2 infections
documented so far, including those associated with this most recent
incident, have been associated with infected poultry.
Three of the 9 individuals were initially hospitalised, but now they
all have been discharged.
The National Public Health Service for Wales and HPA North West is
tracing and following up all close contacts of the individuals who
have been ill, as a precautionary measure.
Notes to editors

Situation updates are also available from the Welsh Assembly
Government website at:

A map detailing the Avian Influenza Restricted Zone declared in
accordance with Article 55 of the Avian Influenza and Influenza of
Avian Origin in Mammals (Wales) (No.2) Order 2006 is also given on
the Welsh Assembly website at:

Assembly Government Avian Influenza Restricted Zone>.
As part of the tracing exercise, and epidemiological investigation,
Defra (Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs) would
like to hear from anyone, who has not already been contacted by
Animal Health officials, who has:
-purchased from or supplied to Chelford Market in Cheshire on Monday
7 May 2007 or
-any poultry keeper who visited Chelford Market on this date whose
birds have subsequently become ill.
These people should contact their local Animal Health Office (details
to be found at ) or from the Defra
helpline 08459 33 55 77 (open between 9am and 5pm, 7 days a week).
According to Defra, all bird keepers throughout the UK should
continue their efforts to maintain high levels of biosecurity and
maintain vigilance by continuing to monitor their birds for signs of
disease. If you are concerned about the health of your birds, you
should seek the advice of your veterinary surgeon; if you suspect
that your birds have avian influenza you should report it to your
Local Animal Health Office.
There is absolutely no reason for anyone to abandon their birds (or
any other pet) because of any fears or worries of infection from
avian influenza. This is an offence under the abandonment of Animals
Act. The welfare of birds is seriously compromised when they are
abandoned and they are at risk from starvation or accident and are
more vulnerable to disease.

Chief veterinary officer for Wales, Dr Christianne Glossop, has
confirmed a case of avian influenza (bird flu) on a farm in North
Wales. The strain identified is H7N2 low pathogenic avian influenza
[LPAI]. The strain is different to the highly pathogenic [HPAI] H5N1
strain currently circulating in Southeast Asia, and in Europe last year [2006].
Great Britain and Wales contingency plans have been activated and the
UK's chief vet, Debby Reynolds, has formally confirmed the presence
of the virus in the UK. The farm has been placed under restriction
and a 1 km (0.62 mi) restriction zone has been placed around it. The
30 remaining birds on the farm are being slaughtered today [24 May
2007]. The source of infection is being investigated.
Poultry keepers are being reminded to report any suspicious signs of
a notifiable avian disease to their local Animal Health Divisional
Office. Members of the National Poultry Register will receive updates by text.
Avian influenza is a disease of birds. It is very rare for humans to
become infected and even then, it is normally associated with close
contact with infected birds. The risk to the health of the general
public is very low. [See commentary].
Routine tests are being carried out on people who work on the farm
and anybody else who has been in close contact.

[According to the UK immediate notification to the OIE (World Animal
Health Organization) on the current H7N2 outbreak, the affected farm
included 15 Rhode Island Reds (chicken breed; picture at
<http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/birds/images/ri_red.jpg>) at
point of lay (22 weeks), 28 hybrid chickens and 2 geese. The full
report, including a map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5481>.
The (probably) 1st recorded case of LPAI H7N2 infection in humans was
recorded in New York in the fall of 2003; see ProMED-mail posting
"Avian influenza A (H7N2) virus, human - USA (New York) 20040420.1104).
It will be interesting to note if this outbreak originated from
contact with wild birds or from traded pet-and-hobby birds. - Mod.AS]
