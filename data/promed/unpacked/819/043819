The Government has said there is "no evidence" to support a leading
scientist's claim of the BSE epidemic lasting longer than previously
thought because of a "real risk" the disease was spread by cow pats [dung
from infected cattle.
BSE expert Dr Alan Dickenson said his research suggested cattle continued
to catch BSE long after the date the Government believed was possible. The
Government has insisted the last cattle were infected in August 1996,
either through contaminated feed or, in a small number of cases, from
mother to calf.
But Dr Dickenson, the founding director of the Neuropathogenisis Unit in
Edinburgh which researches BSE, warned animals born after August 1996 may
have caught the disease a "third way", through infected soil. His research
shows cow pats excreted on to grazing land by cattle at the height of the
epidemic posed a "real risk" of infection. If cattle born after August 1996
caught BSE through infected soil, the epidemic would last longer than the
Government predicted.
The disease's 5-year incubation period means it will not be possible to
tell whether Dr Dickenson is right until 2001. But last night a spokesman
for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, said: "Currently there
is no evidence a third way of BSE transmission exists. Measures introduced
in 1996 should ensure no cases born after August 1996 were infected from
contaminated feed. Maternal transmission of BSE means there will still
continue to be a limited number of cases born after August 1996."
He added, "However because of the offspring cull, these numbers are likely
to be very small."
