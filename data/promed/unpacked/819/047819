[Following the officially notified new BTV-8 cases in Germany and
Belgium and the yet-to-be-confirmed and notified case in the
Netherlands, this case in bordering northeast France is not surprising.
The report mentions, among the control measures, vaccination and
vector control. These statements are in need of explanation:
1. Is vaccination carried out, and, in case affirmative, which
vaccine is applied and in which species?
2. What measures are applied to control the _Culicoides_ vector?
