[The Indonesia Health Ministry reported today (12 Mar 2007) that 85
bird flu cases have been recorded in the country after confirmation
of infection of a 20-year-old woman by the avian influenza virus.]
The woman, from East Java province, had a history of contact with
chicken, an anti-bird flu official of the Ministry, Joko Sugiyono,
said. "She was positive for bird flu," he told Xinhua. "The woman
cleaned a spot where her neighbors threw some dead chickens," said
Sugiyono. The [patient] was hospitalized in the Mojokerto Regency
Hospital of the province on 28 Feb 2007, and on 8 Mar 2007, she was
transferred to a hospital in Surabaya, the capital city of the
province.
Indonesia has recorded 64 fatalities among the 85 people who have
contracted the disease, Sugiyono said.
The number of bird flu cases in the country has increased recently
after months of absence of new cases. The Indonesian health
authorities have imposed a firm policy separating fowls from humans
and surveillance on the viruses, the official said, adding that the
authorities forbid raising fowls in residential areas. Over 32
million families in Indonesia's vast archipelago have been raising
chickens in their back yards, Indonesian Agriculture Minister, Anton
Apriantono, has said.

[There is now a discrepancy between the number of cases confirmed as
H5N1 virus positive by the Indonesia Ministry and the number
recognized by the World Health Organisation (WHO). As of Mon 12 Mar
2007, the WHO list gives the number of confirmed cases as 81 and the
number of deaths as 63. - Mod.CP]
