[Re: ProMED-mail Mayaro virus disease - Venezuela 20100606.1889]
----------------------------------------------------------------
This report of Mayaro virus disease in Venezuela is particularly
interesting because it emphasises the nature of the clinical symptoms,
-- quote -- "it can appear with arthritis, causing strong inflammation
and arthralgias." These symptoms typify Old Word alphaviruses, which
characteristically are associated with arthritic/polyarthritic
clinical disease (the New World viruses typically produce encephalitic
disease in humans).

Thus, the symptoms induced by Mayaro virus in the New World are
atypical in the New World. The description of the outbreak in
Venezuela therefore significantly strengthens the argument that Mayaro
virus is an Old World virus which was introduced to the New World,
possibly via the slave trade as implied recently (see Gould EA et al.
2009. "Understanding the alphaviruses: Recent research on important
emerging pathogens and progress towards their control". Antiviral Res.
(2009), doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.07.007; [abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19616028>]).

Similar arguments have been advanced in previous reviews, to explain
the introduction of yellow fever virus and other flaviviruses into the
New World -- again probably largely due to the slave trade (for
example, Gould EA et al. 2003. "Origins, Evolution, and Vector/Host
Coadaptations Within the genus Flavivirus", Adv Virus Res. 2003; 59:
277-314; [abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14696332>]).
