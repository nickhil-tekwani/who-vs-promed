If the etiologic agent for the recent outbreak in Uruguay were _Haemophilus
influenzae_ biogroup aegyptius, HIB (_Haemophilus influenzae B) vaccine
should be ineffective. HIB vaccine is a conjugate vaccine covalently
linking one of several protein carriers to the polyribosyl-ribitol (PRP)
capsular polysaccharide of _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b. Since Brazilian
purpuric fever (BPF) is caused by unencapsulated strains of _H. influenzae_
biogroup aegyptius, antibody to capsular polysaccharide would not be
protective.
If the outbreak were BPF, it will be interesting to see if the strains are
closely associated with the strains recovered from the original Brazilian
outbreak and subsequent cases. Two additional cases of a BPF-like illness
have been reported in Australia:
1. McIntyre P, Wheaton G, Erlich J, Hansman D. Brasilian purpuric fever in
central Australia [letter. Lancet. 1987;ii:112.
2. Wild BE, Pearman JW, Campbell PB, Swan PK, Garry DL. Brazilian purpuric
fever in Western Australia [letter. Med J Aust. 1989;150:344, 346.
and a recent report from the United States described the isolation of _H.
influenzae_ biogroup aegyptius from a child in Connecticut with purpura and
overwhelming Epstein- Barr [virus infection.
1. Virata M, Rosenstein NE, Hadler JL, et al. Suspected Brazilian purpuric
fever in a toddler with overwhelming Epstein-Barr virus infection. Clin
Infect Dis. 1998;27:1238-40.
