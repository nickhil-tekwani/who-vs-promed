El Salvador: rabies kills boy in the Municipality of Intipuca
-------------------------------------------------------------
Sources from the Salvadoran Ministry of Health reported on Tue 6 Apr 2004
that a 6 year old boy died of rabies after having been bitten by his small
dog. This is the 2nd death so far in 2004. Julio Castro, chief of
epidemiology of the Ministry said that the boy was hospitalized in the
intensive care unit of the Benjamin Bloom pediatric hospital, in the
capital of the country, and died on Sun 4 Apr 2004. The victim, who lived
in the municipality of Intipuca, 112 miles south east of San Salvador,
contracted the infection when his pet dog, a boxer puppy less than 2 months
old, bit him.
The symptoms of the disease -- restlessness, fear of water, difficulty
walking -- appeared on Thu 1 Apr 2004 and caused his parents to consult a
physician who subsequently referred the patient to the Bloom hospital.
Castro commented that, as a preventive measure, about 200 dogs and 50 cats
in the immediate vicinity of the boy's home "were vaccinated".
The other fatal victim so far in 2004 was a 45 year old man who died in
January. In 2003, 5 people died in El Salvador as a consequence of rabies.
