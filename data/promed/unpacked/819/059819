Defra lifts last FMD infected area
----------------------------------
The last remaining foot and mouth infected area in England will be lifted
at midnight tonight.
The landmark move follows extensive blood testing of sheep and clinical
examination of cattle in the Brough and Kirkby Stephen area of Cumbria. It
marks the end of a massive programme of blood testing within 3km Protection
Zones. The successful completion of serological testing in the last
remaining 3km Protection Zones over the past few weeks has seen the release
of over 17 000 farms from Infected Areas. However, animal movements are
still subject to licences from local authorities.
The announcement, which affects almost 1500 farms in Cumbria, North
Yorkshire and County Durham, gives farmers greater flexibility on
restocking and other day to day farming activities. However, those farms
that were culled out as infected premises or as dangerous contacts will
remain under restrictions until they have completed the cleansing and
disinfection process and restocked successfully - or until a period of 12
months has elapsed. These counties will not be eligible to become
classified as "FMD-Free" until at least 90 days after the last case there,
which for Cumbria means the end of the year at the earliest.
Welcoming the news, DEFRA Minister Lord Whitty said today: "The lifting of
the last remaining Infected Area in the country is a momentous achievement
and reflects a great deal of hard work by teams on the ground. I thank the
farmers of Cumbria, and the wider community there, for the patience and
cooperation they have demonstrated while the blood testing programme has
been ongoing. We are not out of the woods yet. A number of counties in
northern England have yet to be classified as "FMD-Free," pending further
testing of sheep flocks in the surveillance zones. I would urge everyone to
remember that strict biosecurity is as essential now as it has ever been.
With the continued cooperation of everyone, we can ensure that this disease
is finally eradicated."
Ray Anderson, the regional operations director in Cumbria, said today:
"This is the moment Cumbria has been waiting for all year. The lifting of
infected area restrictions is the first step for the farming industry in
Cumbria to get back to business as usual."

[2030 farms have been confirmed as infected in the UK since the beginning
of the epizootic in February, 2001. The last case was recorded on 30 Sep
2001 in Appleby, Cumbria. The European policy regarding the prevention and
control of FMD is to be discussed during an international conference in
Brussels, 12-13 Dec 2001. <http://www.cmlag.fgov.be/eng/conference.html>
