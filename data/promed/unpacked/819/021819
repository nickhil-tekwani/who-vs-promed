An outbreak of the deadly Marburg virus disease in Uganda has spread to the capital Kampala after an infected woman travelled to the city and the death toll from the disease has now climbed to 5, a health official said on Mon 22 Oct 2012.

This latest outbreak of haemorrhagic fever, first confirmed on Fri 19 Oct 2012 in Kabale district, 430 km (270 miles) southwest of Kampala, has rattled a country that only 2 weeks ago declared itself free of Ebola virus disease after it claimed at least 16 lives. There is no vaccine or specific treatment for the Marburg virus [disease], also known as Marburg haemorrhagic fever, which is transmitted through body fluids such as saliva and blood, or by handling infected wild animals such as monkeys.

"We have one case confirmed in Mulago Hospital while the number of the dead is now 5," Rukia Nakamatte, spokesperson for the ministry of health told Reuters on Monday [22 Oct 2012]. "34 contacts are being monitored and an isolation facility is being set up." A health official told Reuters on Monday that the woman at Mulago, the country's largest referral hospital, had travelled to Kampala about 5 days ago and is a member of a family in Kabale which lost 3 people.

Health investigators have yet to determine the origin of the latest Marburg infection but Uganda's Director General of Health Services, Dr Ruth Aceng, said on Friday [19 Oct 2012] that outbreaks of haemorrhagic fevers in Uganda tend to occur between June and September. This is the period when villagers who go into the wild to collect fruit are likely to come into contact with wild animals such as fruit bats, a [presumptive] natural vector for the Marburg virus.

Elly Matte, a police spokesperson in Kabale, said people were alarmed about the viral outbreak. "We... might impose a quarantine if the situation worsens," he said. Ugandan Health officials, as preventative measures, have urged people to avoid public gatherings and bodily contact. The World Health Organisation has deployed a team to the district to support the outbreak investigation and response.

The last outbreak of Marburg in Uganda was in 2007 and killed 2 miners in the west while the deadliest occurrence of haemorrhagic fever was in 2000 when 425 people contracted Ebola virus infection and more than half of them died.

Marburg virus disease starts with a severe headache followed by haemorrhaging and, in previous outbreaks in Africa, results in death in 80 percent or more of cases, usually within 8 to 9 days. Although both Marburg virus and Ebola virus are highly contagious and have high case-fatalities, Marburg has a shorter incubation period of 14 days, compared to Ebola's 21.

[Significant new information is that all the suspected and confirmed cases are members of the same family, and the observation that: "Outbreaks of haemorrhagic fevers in Uganda tend to occur between June and September -- the period when villagers go into the wild to collect fruit are likely to come into contact with wild animals such as fruit bats."

Kabale district is bordered by Rukungiri district to the north, Ntungamo district to the northeast, the Republic of Rwanda to the east and south, Kisoro district to the west, and Kanungu district to the northwest. The town of Kabale, where the district headquarters are located, lies approximately 420 km (260 miles) by road southwest of Kampala, the capital city of Uganda.
