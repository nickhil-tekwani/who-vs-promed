Ciguatera from Fish Served at 2 Restaurants Sickens 10 in St. Louis
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A food poisoning outbreak in St. Louis, MO, has officials there
scratching their heads. At least 10 patrons of 2 area restaurants
have fallen ill with an unusual fish-borne illness called ciguatera.
The Food & Drug Administration (FDA) is investigating the outbreak,
which is unusually large, as only about 30 cases of ciguatera are
reported in the US each year.

All of the people involved in the St. Louis ciguatera outbreak ate
amberjack, a tropical fish, at either the Blue Water Grill in
Kirkwood or Frazer's Restaurant and Lounge in St. Louis.

Ciguatera is a food poisoning caused by toxins within fish that eat
other fish that have ingested toxic algae, sometimes called red tide.
Ciguatera toxin may be found in large reef fish, most commonly
barracuda, grouper, red snapper, eel, amberjack, sea bass, and
Spanish mackerel. The toxin that causes ciguatera cannot be cooked
out of fish, and there is no way to detect its presence.

While rare in the US, ciguatera is the most common type of fishborne
food poisoning in the world, and most cases occur in the Caribbean.
Ciguatera symptoms occur within 6 hours of consumption and range from
nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, to neurological symptoms including
headache, sensory disorientation, vertigo and muscular weakness. The
disease is rarely fatal, but in severe cases symptoms can linger for
months or years. There is no way to cure ciguatera, but the symptoms
can be treated while the disease runs its course. It is important
that ciguatera victims avoid dehydration, and sometimes intravenous
fluids are required.

Both St. Louis-area restaurants purchased the amberjack at Bob's
Seafood in University City, MO. Bob's Seafood in turn, had procured
the amberjack from a federally inspected facility in Louisiana. The
FDA is now trying to determine the source of the ciguatera contamination.

The St. Louis Department of Health, which is expected to issue a
health alert today [12 Dec 2007], believes that there may be other
ciguatera victims in the area, and they are working with officials in
St. Louis County to get the word out to health providers so they can
spot ciguatera symptoms, which can sometimes mimic more serious
diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.

There have been no recorded cases of ciguatera in the St. Louis area
before now. The health department is asking anyone who ate amberjack
recently and is suffering from symptoms similar to ciguatera to call
the St. Louis Department of Health at 314-612-5289.

[Although the toxin is formed within the fish, one wonders about the origin
of the fish as well as the person who processed the fish prior to
shipping. Hopefully the investigation will determine this.

Background information on ciguatera poisoning can be found at the FDA
Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition website:
<http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap36.html>

"Ciguatera is a form of human poisoning caused by the consumption of
subtropical and tropical marine finfish which have accumulated
naturally occurring toxins through their diet. The toxins are known
to originate from several dinoflagellate (algae) species that are
common to ciguatera endemic regions in the lower latitudes.

"Manifestations of ciguatera in humans usually involves a combination
of gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiovascular disorders.
Symptoms defined within these general categories vary with the
geographic origin of toxic fish.

"Clinical testing procedures are not presently available for the
diagnosis of ciguatera in humans. Diagnosis is based entirely on
symptomatology and recent dietary history. An enzyme immunoassay
(EIA) designed to detect toxic fish in field situations is under
evaluation by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC)
and may provide some measure of protection to the public in the future.

"Marine finfish most commonly implicated in ciguatera fish poisoning
include the groupers, barracudas, snappers, jacks, mackerel, and
triggerfish. Many other species of warm-water fishes harbor ciguatera
toxins. The occurrence of toxic fish is sporadic, and not all fish of
a given species or from a given locality will be toxic." - Mod.TG]
