The outbreak of typhoid fever in Tajikistan is very worrying, with the
potential for many thousands of patients. Previous outbreaks have been
characterised by multidrug resistance. Confirmation of the infection and
detailed information on the spectrum of resistance would be invaluable to
dealing with the epidemic. We would be happy to assist if that was
appropriate in technical assistance for culture, sensitivity testing, and
advice about possible treatment options. Please get in contact if that
would be of help and interest.
