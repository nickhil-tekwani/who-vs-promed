A comment on the transmission of _T. solium_
--------------------------------------------
In contrast to what was stated in your 6 May 2005 report
(Neurocysticercosis in children in Eastern Cape Province, South
Africa), this disease is usually not acquired by "by eating infected
pork," but by ingesting food (e.g. vegetables) contaminated by _T.
solium_ eggs. This fact can also explain how people who never ever
eat pork, such as orthodox Jews, are still at risk of acquiring this
disease. See: Neurocysticercosis in an Orthodox Jewish community in
New York City. Schantz P. M., Moore A. C., Munoz J. L., Hartman B.
J., Schaefer J. A., Aron A. M., Persaud D., Sarti E., Wilson M.,

The moderator may wish to clarify that human cysticercosis is caused by
ingesting Taenia eggs from the feces of humans infected with _Taenia
solium_, the pork tapeworm. If a human eats undercooked pork infected with
the pig larval cysticerci, the parasite will grow to an adult tapeworm in
the small intestine of the human. This adult tapeworm them produces eggs
which can infect other humans or pigs [causing] cysticercosis.

[Many thanks to Drs. Halperin & Kightlinger for pointing out that _T.
solium_ can be transmitted by food items contaminated by _T. solium_ eggs.
The life cycle is complicated, and the intestinal form of _T. solium_
infection is acquired by eating pork containing cysticerci in the
muscles. Thus, infection -- through, for instance, vegetables as mentioned
here -- requires that these items be contaminated by human feces, as
infected pigs do not shed eggs. - Mod.EP]
