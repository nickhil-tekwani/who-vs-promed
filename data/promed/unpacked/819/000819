Chad began providing relief this week to 3200 families who fled their
homes when River Chari burst its banks, raising fears a cholera
outbreak would spread as floodwaters inundate neighborhoods in the
capital. Experts fear the river, which burst its banks earlier this
month [October 2010], could breach its banks again and flood bigger
areas of the capital N'Djamena, home to about 800 000 inhabitants.

The UN Children's Agency (UNICEF) has warned that a cholera outbreak
that has infected about 4000 people and killed at least 135 across
Chad, may deepen as floodwaters sweep contaminated water from
latrines into wells.

Contrary to a widely published United Nations (UN) report that put
the cholera cases and death tolls in Nigeria at 38 173 and above 1500
respectively, the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) has said that the
country had 37 289 cholera cases and 1434 deaths between 1 Jan 2010
and 25 Oct 2010.

Chief epidemiologist FMOH, Dr Henry Akpan, told The Guardian: "We
base our figures from reports we get from the states and our partners
who are working in the states. We do not base our figures on
newspaper reports."

[4] Cholera - Nigeria (Bauchi)
Date: Tue 26 Oct 2010

The Bauchi State government says 100 persons died as a result of a
cholera epidemic in the state in the last 3 months. The commissioner
for health Alhaji Muhammad Yahaya Jalam told newsmen in Bauchi on 25
Oct 2010 only a few patients were still in hospital unlike in the
past when between 50 and 100 patients were admitted in one day,
saying over 11 220 cases were recorded all over the state out of
which 100 died.

Yahaya Jalam said the situation reduced due to measures put in place
by the state government in collaboration with the Doctors Without
Borders (Medecins san Frontieres) adding that part of the measures
was the chlorination of over 6000 wells in all parts of the state
while the health team works 24 hours to control the spread.

A cholera epidemic in Cameroon since April 2010 has led to the death
of 559 people, the country's health minister has said. The disease
has affected a total of 8528 people, health minister Andre Mama Fouda
said on Mon 25 Oct 2010. The North Rim area suffered the most, with
8227 cases and 542 deaths, followed by the Northern region with 261
cases and 10 deaths, Littoral region with 173 cases and 5 deaths and
the Centre with 27 cases and 2 deaths, Prensa Latina reported.

Dirty water consumption was the main cause of the epidemic, according
to a research conducted by the Shepherd Center in collaboration with
the health ministry.

[6] Cholera - Benin

Benin is at risk of a major cholera outbreak, an international aid
agency warned yesterday [25 Oct 2010], as the West African nation
reeled from its worst flooding since 1963. 55 000 homes have been
destroyed or damaged, and 250 000 people left homeless by the
flooding, leaving many susceptible to the water borne disease, said
Care International.

"The latrines are flooded, so people are bathing, cooking, and
drinking with water that has human waste in it," Helen Hawkins, a
water and sanitation specialist with Care in Benin told The Irish Times.

"Some people have obviously stayed in their homes to protect their
belongings but that means they are living in flooded homes surrounded
by water. So there is quite a risk of a possible outbreak." So far,
846 cases of cholera and 7 deaths from the disease have been recorded.

A total of 16 people have died in a cholera outbreak in a tea-growing
area of northeastern India, prompting the local state government to
sound a health alert, officials said Wed 27 Oct 2010.

Some 150 others tested positive since the disease was reported last
week [week of 18 Oct 2010] in 6 tea gardens in Sonitpur district,
about 230 km (140 mi) north of Guwahati, the main city in the state of Assam.

"Most of the casualties were reported from tea garden areas and it
appears the victims were down with cholera due to poor hygiene,"
senior local health official Anup Bhattacharyya told AFP in Guwahati.

The deaths occurred since Tuesday [26 Oct 2010], he added, with local
doctors blaming delays in bringing the ill to hospitals for the toll.

"A general health alert has been sounded and all steps are being
taken to deal with the outbreak," Assam health minister Himanta Biswa
Sarma told AFP.

The disease, which is primarily transmitted through contaminated food
and water, causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, and can fatally
dehydrate a victim in a matter of hours.

Healthcare facilities in most of India's 7 insurgency-riven
northeastern states including Assam are primitive. Tea pickers often
live in dirty, cramped conditions without electricity or access to
clean drinking water.

[8] Cholera - Pakistan: WHO

On 12 Oct 2010, the Ministry of Health in Pakistan reported
laboratory confirmation of 99 cases of _Vibrio cholerae_ 01 in the
country. These cases were laboratory-confirmed by the National
Institute of Health since the beginning of the flood until 30 Sep
2010. These cases have been reported sporadically from a wide
geographical area in the flood-affected provinces of Sindh, Punjab,
and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The Ministry of Health in Pakistan supported by the WHO and other
local and international partners are collaborating closely to prevent
outbreaks of any disease, including cholera, and treat people
affected by such illnesses. More than 60 diarrheal treatment centres
are either operating or are soon to start functioning in the 46 most
affected districts of the country. Diarrheal diseases including
cholera are among the most reported health conditions in many
locations affected by the recent floods disaster in the country.
