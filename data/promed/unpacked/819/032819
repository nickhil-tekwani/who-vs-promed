Influenza at the human-animal interface (HAI)
Summary and assessment, 28 Sep to 30 Oct 2017
---------------------------------------------
New infections: since the previous update, new human infections with influenza A(H1N2)v and A(H3N2)v variant 2 viruses were reported.

Risk assessment: The overall public health risk from currently known influenza viruses at the human-animal interface has not changed, and the likelihood of sustained human-to-human transmission of these viruses remains low. Further human infections with viruses of animal origin are expected.

IHR compliance: All human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are required to be reported under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). This includes any animal and non-circulating seasonal influenza viruses. Information from these notifications is critical to inform risk assessments for influenza at the human-animal interface.

Swine influenza viruses
-----------------------
Current situation
- Influenza A(H1N2)v viruses
One new laboratory-confirmed human infection with influenza A(H1N2)v viruses was detected in the state of Ohio in the [USA]. The case occurred in a child who reported contact with swine at an agricultural event prior to illness. The case was not hospitalized and has fully recovered. No human-to-human transmission was identified. Characterization of the virus from the case indicates it is similar to A(H1N2)v viruses previously detected and similar to the existing candidate vaccine virus.

Since 2005, 12 cases of A(H1N2)v influenza virus infection have been reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most cases are associated with mild illness and two have been hospitalized.

- Influenza A(H3N2)v viruses
Since 27 Sep 2017, 41 human infections with influenza A(H3N2)v viruses were detected in the USA in several states. All cases reported exposure to swine at an agricultural fair before illness onset. 2 cases were hospitalized and all were recovering or have recovered at the time of reporting. No human-to-human transmission was identified. Characterization of the viruses from these cases indicates they are similar to A(H3N2)v viruses previously detected and similar to the existing candidate vaccine virus. Since reporting of novel influenza A viruses became nationally notifiable in 2005, 462 human infections with influenza A(H3N2)v viruses have been reported to the US CDC and 59 of these occurred in 2017.

Risk assessment
---------------
1. What is the likelihood that additional human cases of infection with swine influenza viruses will occur?
Swine influenza viruses circulate in swine populations in many regions of the world. Depending on geographic location, the genetic characteristics of these viruses differ. Most human cases are exposed to swine influenza viruses through contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness. Since these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations, further human cases can be expected.

2. What is the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of swine influenza viruses?
No case clusters have been reported. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood is low.

3. What is the risk of international spread of swine influenza viruses by travelers?
Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as these viruses have not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.

Overall risk management recommendations
---------------------------------------
- WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface. For recommendations on safe trade in animals from countries affected by these influenza viruses, refer to OIE guidance.
- WHO advises that travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.
- Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health, especially over the coming winter months. Continued vigilance is needed within affected and neighbouring areas to detect infections in animals and humans and collaboration between the animal and human health sectors is essential. As the extent of virus circulation in animals is not clear, epidemiological and virological surveillance and the follow-up of suspected human cases should remain high.
- All human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005). State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.
- It is critical that influenza viruses from animals and people are fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories and reported according to international standards. Under WHO's Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, Member States are expected to share their influenza viruses with pandemic potential on a regular and timely basis with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a WHO-coordinated network of public health laboratories. The viruses are used by the public health laboratories to assess the risk of pandemic influenza and to develop candidate vaccine viruses.
