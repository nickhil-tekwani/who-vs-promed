Chinese Ducks Felled by New Virus
---------------------------------

Peking duck, salted duck eggs, duck soup: China is famous for its
duck delicacies, and duck farms dot the country's agricultural belt.
So last spring [2010], when Chinese farmers noticed their prized birds
were producing fewer eggs than usual, they began to worry. Egg
production plummeted by as much as 90 percent in some flocks. Ducks
were waddling about awkwardly, their coordination off kilter, and
eating less than usual. Some died within days.

By the end of the year, an estimated 4.4 million ducks in Fujian,
Shandong, and Zhejiang provinces, the swath of eastern China where
duck farming is common, had caught the mysterious illness. And the
outbreak reached at least 6 other provinces, along with rural areas
outlying Beijing.

Enter microbiologist George Gao and colleagues at the Chinese Academy
of Sciences in Beijing. By analyzing the affected animals, the
scientists isolated an aggressive new flavivirus, a class of viruses
that includes yellow and dengue fevers —- the 1st flavivirus ever
identified in ducks.

The discovery of what the scientists have dubbed the BYD virus [see
commentary] raises some critical concerns. In addition to potentially
devastating Chinese duck farming and the economy that depends on it,
the flavivirus could put humans at risk. "Most flaviviruses are
zoonotic," meaning they can be transmitted from animals to people, Gao
says, "so infection of human beings cannot be ruled out."

When reports of the duck disease 1st reached the researchers last
April, the symptoms farmers described —- particularly a severe drop
in egg production —- alarmed them. Arriving at the farms, the
microbiologists collected tissue and serum samples from animals in
affected flocks for testing. As detailed in a paper published this
month in PLoS ONE [see commentary], Gao and his colleagues worked
methodically to find the culprit.

First, they ruled out avian flu by testing serum samples from the
animals for flu antibodies. Then, working with brain and ovary tissue
from ducks that had died within 6 hours of infection, they isolated
the BYD virus.

To make sure they had nailed the right culprit, they injected healthy
ducks with BYD, comparing them with a control group. The BYD ducks
soon fell ill.

Gao and colleagues say the BYD virus is closely related to the
Tembusu virus, a flavivirus found in Southeast Asia [isolated from
mosquitoes collected in Malaysia. - Mod.AS]. Like that other virus,
they suggest, BYD could be spread by mosquitoes.

Transmission by mosquitoes should not be a foregone conclusion, says
Ernest Gould, a virologist and visiting scholar at the Universite de
la Mediterranee in Aix-Marseille, France, noting that temperature
changes over the period of the virus's spread are not consistent with
those of other mosquito-borne flaviviruses. (Ducks started falling ill
in the cool weather of early spring, when mosquito populations were
presumably low, and the outbreak continued well through autumn.) "Much
more detailed epidemiological studies are required," Gould wrote in an
e-mail.

But, he adds, the paper "raises an important alarm with potential
implications way beyond the boundaries of China." He says a rapidly
spreading Chinese flavivirus could mean a global problem.

Because of the pervasiveness of duck farming in China, Gao and
colleagues stress that the disease should be closely monitored, in
part because it could spread to people. The next step, they say, is
the development of a BYD vaccine.

electronic, free journal PLoS ONE; citation: Su J, Li S, Hu X, Yu X,

New Tembusu-Related Flavivirus. PLoS ONE 6(3): e18106.
doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0018106. According to the paper, the isolated
virus was named as Baiyangdian (BYD) virus (BYDV) after the region
name where the virus was 1st isolated. The paper's abstract follows:

"Abstract
Since April 2010, a severe outbreak of duck viral infection, with egg
drop, feed uptake decline and ovary-oviduct disease, has spread around
the major duck-producing regions in China. A new virus, named BYD
virus, was isolated in different areas, and a similar disease was
reproduced in healthy egg-producing ducks, infecting with the isolated
virus. The virus was re-isolated from the affected ducks and
replicated well in primary duck embryo fibroblasts and Vero cells,
causing the cytopathic effect. The virus was identified as an
enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus with a size of approximately 55
nm in diameter. Genomic sequencing of the isolated virus revealed that
it is closely related to Tembusu virus (a mosquito-borne Ntaya group
flavivirus), with 87­91 percent nucleotide identity of the partial E
(envelope) proteins to that of Tembusu virus and 72 percent of the
entire genome coding sequence with Bagaza virus, the most closely
related flavivirus with an entirely sequenced genome. Collectively our
systematic studies fulfill Koch's postulates, and therefore, the
causative agent of the duck egg drop syndrome occurring in China is a
new flavivirus. Flavivirus is an emerging and re-emerging zoonotic
pathogen and BYD virus that causes severe egg-drop, could be
disastrous for the duck industry. More importantly its public health
concerns should also be evaluated, and its epidemiology should be
closely watched due to the zoonotic nature of flaviviruses."

The Ntaya serogroup of the genus _Flavivirus_ includes also the
Israel turkey meningoencephalitis (ITM) virus (a non-zoonotic,
mosquito-borne virus). A vaccine against ITMV has been in use for more
than 30 years in turkeys in Israel; and was applied, in the past, also
to protect geese against another _flavivirus_, namely West Nile virus
(see 20010607.1117). - Mod.AS]

[In follow-up studies, it would be of interest to collect mosquitoes
from the areas with infected ducks and test them for presence of the
BYD flavivirus. In addition, cloacal swabs should be taken and tested
for BYD virus shedding, as there is evidence that another flavivirus
-- West Nile virus -- is shed and can be transmitted among crows
without mosquito vectors under laboratory conditions. - Mod.TY]
