A one-year-old girl died on [Tue 18 Dec 2018], 3 days after she was administered the measles and rubella (MR) vaccination at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) at Nagpur in Maharashtra following a diagnosis of gastroenteritis, the Indian Express reported.

According to district health officer Prashant Uikey, the minor, [AG], was vaccinated at Tumsar tehsil's Garra village on [Sat 15 Dec 2018], along with her 4-year-old brother [SG]. After receiving the vaccination, they went home, but on the same day, [AG] suffered diarrhea, and her parents took her to the local hospital, the Indian Express reported.

As her condition deteriorated, she was rushed to General Hospital at Bhandara, which further directed her to GMCH in Nagpur on [Sun 16 Dec 2018], where she succumbed. Meanwhile, her brother, who was also admitted to the hospital, was discharged on [Wed 19 Dec 2018].

On [Fri 7 Dec 2018], an 11-year-old girl, [AW], from Bhandara's Lakhni tehsil, died following complications developed after the MR vaccination.

Earlier on [Fri 7 Dec 2018], more than 30 children were hospitalised after they were given the MR vaccine in Saraswati Shishu Mandir school in Shahjahanpur district of Uttar Pradesh. After receiving the vaccination, students started falling ill and complained of giddiness and headache. All the students were rushed to the local hospital following the illness. Although all the students were out of danger, an inquiry was ordered into the matter.

["[Measles] can cause complications such as blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, and severe respiratory infections, including pneumonia.

"Rubella on its own is not a high-risk infection, but rubella infection during early pregnancy can pose serious risks to the foetus, as in 90% of the cases, the virus is transmitted to the foetus. This can result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in infants. CRS can cause deafness, disabilities, heart impairment, autism, and other birth defects. Around 40 000 children are born with birth defects due to CRS every year in India, according to WHO.

"According to WHO, 'one-third of all measles-related deaths worldwide occur in India.' The number of measles-related deaths in the country in 2015, 2016, and 2017 was 44, 33, and 28, respectively.

"It was reported that 4 children died after the vaccination in Gujarat in July 2018. Later, a team of immunisation experts from the centre ruled out the linkage between the deaths and the vaccine.

"'The MR vaccination programme is safe, and the deaths of 4 children after they were administered the vaccine was due to reasons that are not related to the vaccination. The children died within 5 days after they were given the vaccination. They showed acute abdominal symptoms, acute gastritis, viral encephalitis, and drug reaction, which are not related to vaccination,' said Pradeep Haldar, deputy commissioner for immunisation, Health Ministry.

"The operational guidelines of the MR vaccine by the Health Ministry say that 5% of the recipients may experience fever and 2% may face transient rashes. In rare cases -- one in one million -- children may face anaphylaxis within 5-30 minutes after the injection. Symptoms of anaphylaxis are rashes, swollen eyes, breathing obstruction, low blood pressure, abdominal cramps, and loss of consciousness."

The comments above are excerpted from https://www.thequint.com/news/webqoof/all-about-measles-rubella-vaccination.

The unfortunate deaths of these children will never be completely clear, but the deaths are unlikely to have been caused by the MR vaccine. It is safer to be immunized with the vaccine than to risk severe disease following infection in the absence of the vaccine. Any information on these fatalities would be appreciated. - Mod.LK
