Iowa: Suri Alpaca Tests West Nile Virus-positive
------------------------------------------------
The Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU VDL)
announced today [Tue 17 Sep 2002] that samples from a Suri Alpaca
have tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV). Samples from this
animal were positive by the Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR) test for WNV conducted at the ISU VDL. PCR results
were confirmed at National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) and
virus isolation is pending at NVSL.
Clinical signs consisted of torticolis, ataxia, recumbency, and
"crying like in pain." The animal exhibited clinical signs for 3.5
days prior to death. A mild to moderate, diffuse, non-suppurative
meningoencephalitis was identified.

[This observation extends the range of domestic stock at risk from
West Nile virus infection. In 2000, 2 llamas were reported West Nile
virus-positive in Connecticut, and one in Massachusetts in 2001;
clinical status unknown. The equine vaccine has been tested in llamas
and found to be immunogenic at the equine dose. Llama owners and
breeders are using the vaccine in some states. It is likely that the
same vaccine could be employed to protect alpaca. - Mod.CP]
