(Date of last previously reported outbreak: 1997).
Translation of a fax received on 23 Jan 2001 from Dr. Emerio F. Serrano
Ramirez, Director General of the Institute of Veterinary Medicine, Ministry
of Agriculture, Havana:
Report date: 15 Jan 2001.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, epidemiological and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 28 Dec 2000.
Estimated date of first infection: 21 Dec 2000.
Outbreaks:
Location / No. of outbreaks
La Lisa municipality, Havana City province / 1
San Jose municipality, Havana province / 2
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
lep / 306 / 43 / 43 / ... / 263
Diagnosis:
When a sudden high mortality rate occurred in a production unit for private
consumption, rabbit hemorrhagic disease was immediately suspected because
of the clinical signs present, and when the first cases of adult rabbits
(alive or dead) were received with a known clinical history the following
procedures were followed:
- clinical observations were carried out;
- blood samples were taken for hematological investigation;
- all of the animals were subjected to a rigorous anatomopathological
examination and postmortem examinations were carried out in accordance with
the technique required for this species;
- fragments of various organs were selected for histopathological
examination and bacteriological investigation, in order to rule out other
diseases;
- liver and spleen samples were taken under aseptic conditions from the
various animals in order to carry out a hemagglutination test with type O
human erythrocytes;
- other samples were collected in order to carry out observations by
electron microscopy.
The evaluation of case histories and epidemiological data, together with
the anatomopathological and histopathological observations and the results
of the hemagglutination test, led to a strong suspicion of the disease,
which was corroborated by the results of electron microscopy.
Control and surveillance measures adopted to date: when rabbit hemorrhagic
disease was suspected, immediate action was taken.
- A disease emergency was declared in the provinces of Havana and Havana
City, and a disease alert was issued in the provinces of Pinar del Rio and
Matanzas.
- Epidemiological surveillance and information campaigns were stepped up
nation-wide.
- A ban was declared on the movement of rabbits in and around the outbreaks.
- Radical measures were applied in and around the outbreaks and the
necessary sanitary measures were adopted, both to prevent the disease from
spreading and to protect major centers in the country.
