[3] Iran: gastrointestinal clinical presentation
Date: Mon 18 May 2020
Source: Radio Farda [edited]
https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-experts-say-coronavirus-symptoms-changing-from-respiratory-to-gastrointestinal-/30620493.html


Iranian epidemiologists say the symptoms associated with COVID-19 in Iran have changed from respiratory to gastrointestinal. They also believe the shift to gastrointestinal symptoms which are often accompanied with no fever or only low fever cause a delay in diagnosis and result in the further spread of the virus by those who are infected but have no obvious respiratory symptoms to be tested.

"COVID-19 had symptoms such as coughs, shortness of breath, and high fever before. These symptoms were observed in the 1st 2 months after the outbreak. But now the most important symptoms of COVID-19 are gastrointestinal," Dr Mohammad-Reza Mahboubfar, a viral epidemiologist and member of the Coronavirus Taskforce, said on Monday [18 May 2020].

According to Dr Mahboubfar symptoms such as acute diarrhea, abdominal spasms, stomachache, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, low fever, and loss of taste and smell are more prevalent now in COVID-19 patients from various age groups including the elderly and children. On [16 May 2020], Dr Seyed Hassan Abedi, a gastroenterologist at Babol Medical Sciences University, warned about the change in the symptoms of COVID-19 and said fewer patients with respiratory symptoms were being hospitalized but there was an increase in those suffering from gastrointestinal complications.

Dr Abedi maintains that a quarter of all COVID-19 patients only show gastrointestinal symptoms and for the same reason seek medical care later than those whose respiratory symptoms are more pronounced. He warns that delayed diagnosis of coronavirus in patients with milder gastrointestinal symptoms may cause the virus to spread at a higher rate.

According to Dr Abedi who serves at one of the hospitals for coronavirus patients in the northern city of Babol, one of the earliest hotspots of the epidemic, gastrointestinal symptoms are not accompanied by high temperature in about 1/3 of patients but diarrhea in these patients is acute, may occur at least 5 times a day and last up to 2 weeks.

Some Iranian health specialists have pointed out that coronavirus can also cause liver and pancreas damage in COVID-19 patients. Dr Seyed Reza Fatemi, a gastroenterologist from Shahid Beheshti University of Tehran, says that up to 50 percent of COVID-19 patients show gastrointestinal symptoms and that the virus causes liver damage and inflammation of the pancreas in 20 to 30 percent of all patients, especially those with other acute symptoms.

Cases of brain stroke due to coronavirus have also been reported in Iran. Dr Mahmoud-Reza Ashrafi, a professor of medicine at Tehran University of Medical Sciences says in March [2020] there were even several cases of brain stroke in children which may have been due to coronavirus. "Oxygen deprivation and inflammation resulting from COVID-19 can result in thrombosis in arteries and brain strokes," he says.

Some experts, however, say mutation of the virus which may be the cause of new symptoms should not cause too much concern. "Coronavirus is not like the common flu virus that mutates constantly. It may change over time and cause atypical symptoms such as gastrointestinal symptoms, but we shouldn't worry that it will mutate quickly to the point of infecting those who have become immune again," Dr Hossein Keivani, professor of virology at Tehran University told Radio Farda. Dr Mahboubfar who is also a crisis management expert says the change of the symptoms may be affecting the Health Ministry's official statistics on COVID-19. The Ministry's figures do not include patients with the newly emerged gastrointestinal symptoms who are not tested and are therefore lower than the real figures, he says.

Chinese researchers have also noted that the characteristics of gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 are more insidious than the respiratory symptoms, making them easy to overlook. Their findings show that patients might have only gastrointestinal symptoms during the whole course of this disease, and some continue to shed the virus in faeces, despite respiratory samples testing negative.

Dr Mahboubfar predicts that the official number of cases and deaths is going to rise in the coming days because the disease is spreading again in places where it was on decline. "The 2nd wave of coronavirus epidemic has happened as we had predicted," he notes. Dr Mahboubfar attributes the relaxation of the lockdown in the country to the government's concerns about the economic and social consequences of the lockdown rather than the spread of the virus having come under control.

According to official figures which many believe are too low due to being based solely on cases confirmed by testing, 125 000 cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed and more than 7000 have lost their lives since mid-February [2020].

[In the original Chinese publications, gastrointestinal symptoms were noted to occur in about 5% of the cases. But reading the media report above, one can't help but wonder if the case definition used at that time around the world mandated respiratory symptoms and it was a case of "don't look and it isn't there" (the corollary to "seek and ye shall find"). I'm working under the presumption that these cases have been tested and virus PCR was identified in stool specimens. It would be interesting to hear from other countries to know if this same phenomenon is occurring -- an increase in gastrointestinal disease (without respiratory symptoms. - Mod.MPP

[4] USA (California): skilled nursing facility
Date: Mon 18 May 2020 5:35 PM PDT

https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Eleven-residents-dead-in-Vallejo-nursing-home-15279262.php


[Solano] County officials said 11 residents have died in a COVID-19 outbreak at a Vallejo skilled nursing facility where more than 130 people have been infected with the coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2]. In total, 99 residents and 32 staff members at Windsor Vallejo Care Center have been infected with the coronavirus as of Monday morning [18 May 2020], said Dr Bela Matyas, county health officer.

Matyas said 9 of the residents who died were on "comfort care" before they tested positive for COVID-19, meaning they were receiving end-of-life treatment and died at the facility. The other 2 people who died were between the ages of 40 and 65. Both were at the facility for rehabilitation and had underlying health issues. 4 other residents were hospitalized for COVID-19 and survived.

The outbreak has infected more than 80% of the facility's population of 120 residents, Matyas said. The majority are asymptomatic and up to 70 of the cases remain active. "We are obviously not out of the woods until everybody has been able to come out of that COVID unit within the nursing home," Matyas said.

Solano County has 16 deaths in total, meaning the facility's deaths mark 68% of the county's fatalities. The cases account for 31% of the county's total 424 cases as of Monday [18 May 2020]. "That's a very big share," Matyas said. "It's an indication of the profound impact (these outbreaks) can have on the overall picture for a county."

County and public health officials are working with facility staff on outbreak management and infection control, Matyas said. Positive patients are in a separate wing of the facility and monitored for temperature and symptoms 3 times a day. Officials have traced contacts of positive staff members, testing their families and coworkers at other facilities, but have discovered no other infections, Matyas said.

In recent weeks, staffing levels at the Vallejo facility dropped to concerning lows because so many staff had tested positive and had to stay home, Matyas said. The company, which runs 44 facilities in California and Arizona, sent staff from other facilities. "There were times in the course of the last several weeks when their staffing was getting to the point where we were mutually concerned," Matyas said.

Officials began testing at the facility more than 2 weeks ago after receiving reports of possible infections and confirmed 18 cases on [1 May 2020]. The number quickly grew to 99 cases -- 76 residents and 23 staff -- 3 days later.

Solano County plans to offer testing for residents and staff at the county's other skilled nursing facilities within the next few weeks as a prevention measure, Matyas said. So far, single infections but no larger outbreaks have been detected in congregate settings. The Vallejo facility marks the latest congregate care setting to be ravaged by the deadly virus.

In the Bay Area, at least 17 deaths are linked to an outbreak at Gateway Care and Rehabilitation in Hayward, according to recent data from the state. In a separate outbreak, 17 residents have died at Turlock Nursing and Rehabilitation Center (Stanislaus County), the company reported on Saturday [16 May 2020].

[Unfortunately, this is becoming a common occurrence in the USA and in other countries around the world where skilled nursing facilities exist. In a 9 May 2020 article in the NY Times, a tally of "at least 28 100 residents and workers have died from the coronavirus at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities for older adults in the United States, according to a New York Times database. The virus so far has infected more than 153 000 at some 7700 facilities." The article goes on to mention that while the cases in these facilities account for 11% of USA reported cases, the deaths account for 1/3 of reported deaths in the USA. (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/09/us/coronavirus-cases-nursing-homes-us.html).

[5] Indigenous Amazon tribes: Venezuela
Date: Wed 20 May 2020 12:03 AM
Source: Gulf Times, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]
https://www.gulf-times.com/story/663612/Indigenous-Venezuela-refugees-dangerously-exposed-


Venezuela's displaced indigenous communities are "dangerously exposed" to the coronavirus [COVID-19] pandemic, the United Nations warned yesterday [19 May 2020].

Indigenous people displaced across the border in neighbouring Brazil and Colombia are "at risk" as the novel coronavirus sweeps through South America, said the UN refugee agency [UNHCR].

The UNHCR said the number of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases was increasing, while the 1st deaths had been reported among indigenous communities. The agency said there were almost 5000 indigenous Venezuelans displaced in Brazil, mainly from the Warao ethnic group, but also from the Enapa, Karina, Pemon, and Ye'kwana communities.

"With COVID-19 hitting this Amazon region hard and Brazil emerging as an epicentre of the pandemic, UNHCR is worried that many may struggle without adequate health and sanitation conditions," said spokeswoman Shabia Mantoo.

Meanwhile, a number of indigenous groups live around the Venezuelan border with Colombia. "While their ancestral homes straddle both countries, many have not been able to regularise their stay in Colombia and are undocumented. Some now also face threats from irregular armed groups who control the areas where they live," said Mantoo. She said many were in isolated areas, lacking access to health services and clean water, while others were in cramped dwellings.

"Most of the border indigenous groups are threatened by physical and cultural extinction because of insufficient food and severe malnutrition that can increase the risk of contagion," said Mantoo. Meanwhile, national lockdowns have stopped many of their livelihood activities and faced with increasing poverty, some were having to peddle goods on the streets. "Not only does that expose them to the risk of infection but also stigmatisation and discrimination for perceived inability to comply with lockdown and physical distancing measures," Mantoo said.

The UNHCR said increased resources were urgently required to continue the "life-saving" work being done by host countries and humanitarian organisations and urged countries attending an upcoming donor conference to pledge their financial support. "Alarmingly, the regional response plan for refugees and migrants from Venezuela is currently just 4-percent funded," said Mantoo. The European Union and Spain are to host the online donor conference on [26 May 2020] to support millions of migrants fleeing Venezuela. The event aims to mobilise funds and raise awareness of the plight of more than 5 million people who have escaped the political and economic chaos engulfing Venezuela.

[Another area and indigenous population threatened by COVID. While this doesn't mention the Amazon region specifically, these groups tend to live in the Amazon region in Colombia and Brazil. These groups are outside of the normal lives in these countries and have limited access to healthcare. And the countries in Latin America are undergoing the pandemic with limited surge capacity. - Mod.MPP

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 19 May 2020.

Highlights
----------
- In his opening remarks at the World Health Assembly, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros declared: 'We have come together as the nations of the world to confront the defining health crisis of our time.' In concluding he asserted that the COVID-19 pandemic reminds us that we need a healthier, safer, and fairer world with a stronger WHO to support this goal (https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-world-health-assembly).

- Countries around the world have put in place a range of public health and social measures to suppress or stop community spread of COVID-19. WHO has published a document to provide an overview of public health and social measures, and to propose strategies to limit any possible harm resulting from these interventions (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/overview-of-public-health-and-social-measures-in-the-context-of-covid-19).

- A new WHO report on the health behaviours of 11-15-year-olds in Europe reveals more adolescents have been reporting mental health concerns. The results were based on data between 2014 and 2018 and provide a baseline against which future studies can measure the impact of COVID-19 on young people's lives (http://www.euro.who.int/en/media-centre/sections/press-releases/2020/who-report-on-health-behaviours-of-1115-year-olds-in-europe-reveals-more-adolescents-are-reporting-mental-health-concerns).

- The WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific has released a timeline outlining some of the key moments and actions to respond to COVID-19 in the Region (https://www.who.int/westernpacific/news/detail/18-05-2020-covid-19-timeline-in-the-western-pacific).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South-East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 49 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 65 134 new cases (57.8% of the global newly reported cases), and 3059 deaths (70.8%) for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 69.5% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil 12.2%, and Peru 5.7%. Removing the USA from the denominator as it overshadows other countries in the region, Brazil then accounts for 39.9% of the newly confirmed cases, Peru 18.8%, Chile 11.5%, Mexico 10.4%, and Canada 5.5%. The Americas region is maintaining its status as having the highest cumulative case count of the 6 WHO regions, with the European region as the 2nd-highest region.

The European region reported 19 125 new cases (17.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 825 deaths (19.1%). Russia reported 48.4% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 14.2%, Turkey 6.1%, Belarus 4.8%, Germany at 2.7%, and France and Italy at 2.4% each.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 18 189 new cases (16.1% of the global newly reported cases) and 170 deaths (3.9%). Saudi Arabia reported 28.0% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Qatar 16.5%, Iran at 12.6%, Kuwait 10.5%, Pakistan 10.1%, and the United Arab Emirates at 9.3%.

The African region reported 2358 new cases (2.1% of the global newly reported cases) and 48 deaths (1.1%). South Africa reported 38.9% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Cameroon at 20.4%, Nigeria 9.2%, Algeria at 7.7%, Gabon at 4.7% and Equatorial Guinea at 4.5%. Benin reduced its cumulative case count by 210 cases, and Sao Tome and Principe reduced their cumulative case count by 4 cases.

The Western Pacific region reported 663 new cases (0.6% of the global newly reported cases) and 22 deaths (0.5%). Singapore reported 46.0% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines 30.9%, Japan at 9.0%, and Malaysia 7.1%.

The South-East Asia region reported 7168 new cases (6.4% of the global newly reported cases) and 198 deaths (4.6%). India reported 69.3% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh 22.3% and Indonesia 6.9%. These 3 countries make up 98.6% of all reported cases in the region. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 72.9% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia 22.6%, and Nepal 3.2%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 19 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas is increasing, as is South-East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkins' CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Johns Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
