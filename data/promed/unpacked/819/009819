The Valdivia Health Service has confirmed a new suspected case of [a]
hantavirus [infection] in another resident of the Corral community.
Meanwhile, the hospital staff were negative for the disease [evidence
of infection]. The [new] patient is a 34 year old man who is being
treated in the intensive care unit of the regional hospital. The man
is the spouse of a woman who has a confirmed [hantavirus infection]
and is in serious condition. The tests for this most recent case were
done in the main regional assistance facility of the region and sent
to the Public Health Institute in Santiago, to confirm or exclude the
diagnosis of the disease.

For his part, Juan Andres Varas, intendant [head of the region]
confirmed that the staff of the Corral Hospital were negative for
[evidence] of [a] hantavirus [infection], after having undergone
preventive tests, discarding [the concern] that the hospital where
they work is a focus of the disease [virus transmission].

[As is usual for these types of reports from Chile, the specific
hantavirus involved with these cases of hantavirus infection is not
indicated. The virus most likely to be responsible for this case is
Andes virus, with the long-tailed pygmy rice rat as its rodent host.
Andes virus is the only hantavirus known to be transmitted directly
from person to person. However, these direct transmission cases are
relatively rare, and occur under circumstances of very close contact,
such as between spouses, as may be the case in the above report.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can
be seen at http://www.bios.niu.edu/frayjorge/rod6.jpg.
