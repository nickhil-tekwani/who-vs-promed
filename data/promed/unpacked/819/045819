Marburg disease in Democratic Republic of Congo - Update 2
---------------------------------------------------------------
Marburg virus has been confirmed as the cause of the viral haemorrhagic
fever in the Watsa zone, in the northeastern part of the country. Latest
figures are an estimated 76 cases with 52 deaths.
Laboratory and epidemiological experts from WHO Headquarters are
joining the WHO/Medecins sans frontieres (Belgium and the Netherlands)
team already in the area.
Main tasks will be to determine the current size of the outbreak and the
source of the virus. Technical assistance will also be given to further
implement control measures.
Marburg disease is not very well known; it has caused one past outbreak and
several sporadic cases. It is transmitted to people following contact with
infected animals and animal tissues, and from person-to-person from close
contact with infected patients and body fluids. Both Marburg and the
closely related Ebola virus are often characterized by the sudden onset of
fever, malaise, muscle pain, headache and conjunctivitis. This is followed
by sore throat, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, and both internal and external
bleeding. Liver function may be abnormal and platelet function may be
impaired.
No specific treatment or vaccine exists for Marburg disease. Severe cases
require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently dehydrated
and in need of intravenous fluids. Experimental studies involving the use
of hyperimmune sera on animals demonstrated no long-term protection
against the disease after interruption of therapy.
Suspected cases should be isolated from other patients and strict barrier
nursing techniques practised. All hospital personnel should be briefed on
the nature of the disease and its routes of transmission. Particular
emphasis should be placed on ensuring that high-risk procedures such as the
placing of intravenous lines and the handling of blood, secretions,
catheters and suction devices are done under barrier nursing conditions.
Hospital staff should have individual gowns, gloves and masks. Gloves and
masks must not be reused unless disinfected. Patients who die from the
disease should be promptly buried or cremated.
The natural reservoir of the Marburg virus is unknown. Ebola and Marburg
are viruses from the filovirus family.

The virus responsible for dozens of deaths in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo is not Ebola but a related haemorrhagic fever probably
transmitted by bats or rats, Congolese and World Health Organisation
(WHO) officials said on Thursday.
Blood samples taken from the victims -- mainly gold diggers -- and
tested by the National Institute of Virology in South Africa showed it
was the fatal Marburg virus, WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said in
Geneva.
"It is a virus very closely related to Ebola, but not Ebola,'' he said.
"The clinical symptoms are very similar -- the sudden onset of fever,
haemorrhaging, muscle pain, headaches, etc.''
Congolese state television said on Wednesday the death toll from the
fever, which first hit a remote region in rebel-held territory in January,
had risen to 72.
The WHO said in a statement that "latest figures are an estimated 76
cases with 52 deaths.''
Hartl said that based on the blood samples analysed by its collaborating
institute in Johannesburg, some of the gold miners had died of other
causes. "Some deaths have now been excluded as having been caused
by Marburg. They may have been malaria or something else,'' he said.
The United Nations agency said its experts would try to track down the
natural reservoir of the virus, which can be transmitted by infected
animals and by person-to-person contact.
The virus first broke out in 1967 in Marburg, then West Germany,
where it was contracted by 25 people following contact with infected
monkeys, the WHO said. As with Ebola, there is no specific treatment
or vaccine for the Marburg virus.
[A further group of 6 people fell ill in Yugoslavia after being in contact
with the same batch of monkeys from Uganda. Both groups were
veterinarians & lab technicians preparing polio vaccine. Out of the total
of 31 people ill, 7 died - Mod.JW
Congolese Health Minister Mashaka Mamba said it was possible the
epidemic was tailing off, as there were only five registered active cases
of the disease in the health centres in Durba and Wtasa, the two most
affected towns in northeast Congo.
"Contrary to earlier information, people are frequenting the hospitals at
a normal rate,'' Mamba said.
The minister also appealed to the international community to set up
permanent research and laboratory facilities in the area.
Congo's leading virologist, Jean-Jacques Muyembe, said although the
symptoms of the Marburg and the Ebola viruses were similar, Ebola
was far more deadly. The Marburg virus has a mortality rate of 10-28
percent, while Ebola's is 88 percent, he said.
[The Ebola-Zaire strain had a case fatality rate (CFR) of 80-90 percent,
the Ebola-Sudan strain about 50 percent. In the current outbreak, 76
cases with 52 deaths gives a case fatality rate of 70 percent. Perhaps
many more survivors of this outbreak will be found as the
investigation continues, or we may be seeing a more virulent strain -
Mod.JW
There have also been proven cases in which the Marburg virus has been
passed on through sexual contact. There are no known cases of sexual
transmission of Ebola, Muyembe said.
[He's referring to the case of a Yugoslav veterinarian who recovered,
then infected his wife. He was found to have infectious semen -
Mod.JW
Since 1967 there have been other outbreaks of suspected Marburg
fever, the last in 1994 and 1997 in Durba.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Thursday a virus
responsible for 63 deaths in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was
not Ebola, but a related haemorrhagic fever probably transmitted by
bats or rats.
The WHO has recorded 63 deaths from 68 cases of the disease, while
Congolese state television has reported 72 have died out of 76 registered
cases.
"In all likelihood the reservoir (for the virus) was either rats or
bats,'' Hartl said. "We are sending animal specialists to find the rats
and bats in the old abandoned gold mines and trap and test them.''
