Less than 4% of the pigs in 600 farms located in low-risk areas in the
country have tested positive for the Nipah virus. Veterinary Services
Department director-general Datuk Dr Mohd Nordin Mohd Noor said the result
was encouraging and was better than the department had anticipated. He
said the department was now conducting its second round of testing which
was scheduled to be completed by July 20. "About 230 farms have undergone
the second round of testing but the results are not known yet. "We do not
expect the results to show a higher percentage than the first test," he
told reporters after presenting awards to winners of a livestock breeding
competition at the Infoternak farm here yesterday.
On the Government's contribution of RM50 per pig culled to affected pig
farmers, Dr Nordin said only 71 of the 86 pig farmers in Perak had applied
for and received the assistance. In Selangor and Negri Sembilan, he said
the pig farmers had not applied for the contribution as they were still
negotiating for RM200 a pig.
