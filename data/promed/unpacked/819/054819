Tuberculosis identified on 2nd Indiana cervid farm
--------------------------------------------------
An animal on a 2nd Indiana cervid farm has tested positive for bovine
tuberculosis (commonly called "TB," or more formally known as
_Mycobacterium bovis_). The mature female elk [also known as cow elk -
Mod.TG] was identified through testing by the Indiana State Board of
Animal Health (BOAH) after it was traced from the cervid operation
that tested positive for the disease in May. "Cervid" is a category of
animals that includes elk and various species of deer.

The latest herd, a multi-species operation in Wayne County , is
currently under quarantine until further testing can be completed.

The Board of Animal Health (BOAH) veterinarians continue to notify
owners of animals traced to or from the 1st (index) cervid herd
located in northern Franklin County. Today's [26 Jun 2009]
announcement marks the 1st animal to test positive on another site.
Several other herds are currently under quarantine with test results
pending.

"The slow-growing nature of tuberculosis makes confirmatory testing a
slow process," explains Indiana State Veterinarian Bret D Marsh. "As
we identify more trace herds, almost daily, we recognize that this is
going to be a drawn-out process that will take time. We appreciate the
cooperation we've received so far from the herd owners."

Meanwhile, BOAH is collaborating with the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and the US Department of Agriculture-Wildlife
Services to test wildlife in the immediate area around the index farm.
BOAH staff is teaming with USDA-Veterinary Services to develop plans
to do radius testing of cattle in the region.

Dr Marsh explains the focus on Franklin County: "Since December
[2008], when a TB-positive cow [bovine] was traced to a local farm,
BOAH has been working to identify the source of the disease. While
that beef farm is in close proximity to our index cervid herd, no
physical link has been established. So, we are going to take a close
look at the wildlife in the area."

"After testing of all the livestock operations adjacent to the beef
farm, with no positives, we need to extend that circle to ensure that
TB has not spread any farther in the livestock in the community," Dr
Marsh adds. [Certainly, that circle would include the trace-ins and
trace-outs of the bovine herd. - Mod.TG]

Indiana's TB-free status for cattle has not changed with this latest
discovery; nor has BOAH been notified of any interstate movement
restrictions being placed on Indiana cattle. The state has held a
bovine tuberculosis-free status since 1984 with the USDA. Under
federal guidelines, a TB-positive cervid does not affect the status
for cattle producers. Before the December 2008 case, the last time a
Hoosier herd tested positive for the disease was in the 1970s.
[However, another bovine animal being found TB positive in Indiana
would likely cost the state its coveted free-state status. - Mod.TG]

"Closing out this case is not going to be a fast process," says Dr
Marsh. "I want Hoosier producers to know that BOAH is committed to
protecting animal health in this state, based on the best science we
have. We have work happening on several fronts -- from wildlife
surveillance to ongoing traces of animal movements to follow up
testing. As we move into the next few weeks, our staff will begin
contacting local cattle owners whose herds need to be tested."

Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease that affects
primarily cattle, but can be transmitted to any warm-blooded animal.
TB is difficult to diagnose through clinical signs alone. In the early
stages of the disease, clinical signs are not visible. Later, signs
may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade
fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node
enlargement may also be present. Cattle owners who notice these signs
in their livestock should contact their private veterinarian.

Doug Metcalf, Chief of Staff <dmetcalf@boah.IN.gov>

More information about the disease and the investigation, as it
develops, will be available on the BOAH website at
