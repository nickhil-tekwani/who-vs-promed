Maricopa County health officials investigating a bloody diarrhea outbreak in the West Valley say the incidents are linked to Federico's Mexican Restaurant in Litchfield Park. According to the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, 11 of the 15 people affected have reported eating at the restaurant. A few of the patients are experiencing renal failure, said Dr. Bob England, director of the Maricopa County Departments of Public Health. The Maricopa County Environmental Service Department responded to these reports by inspecting the facility immediately and taking food samples.

"The restaurant has been extremely cooperative with our investigation. In fact, out of an abundance of caution and concern for their customers, the restaurant is voluntarily closing," said Steven Goode, deputy director for MCESD.

Laboratory results indicate the bacteria causing the illness is _E. coli_ O157. This bacteria produces a toxin that can cause severe illness and, especially in children, can lead to kidney failure and even death. In these cases, the most prominent sign of the illness is bloody stool. Anyone who has eaten at this particular Federico's Mexican Food Restaurant on or after 23 Jul 2013 and is experiencing bloody diarrhea should seek medical attention.

This location (13132 W. Camelback Rd.) is the only Federico's location where many of the patients have reported eating, England said. The investigation remains ongoing to determine the specific source.

[In the setting of a restaurant such as this one, it may be difficult to ascertain the specific vehicle of transmission, since if undercooked beef or a salad ingredient such as tomato or lettuce is involved, they are often served in the same food, such as in a beef taco. With only one location involved, it is important to know whether the food is obtained separately from other chain locations. If that is not the case, there is something significant at that specific location, such as an infected food worker. - Mod.LL
