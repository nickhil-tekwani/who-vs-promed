Meat kills one, 4 admitted to hospital
--------------------------------------
One person died and 4 others were admitted in critical condition at the
Thika General District Hospital yesterday from what is suspected to be an
anthrax infection. And over 250 people from Naaro village, Kandara
division, of Murang'a District clamoured at the casualty waiting to be
tested after eating meat from a cow suspected to be infected with the disease.
[The fatal case, a male from the Naaro Primary School, died at midnight
after he ate meat from a dying cow slaughtered by a local farmer on
Thursday. Apparently the farmer sold the meat after a retired veterinary
officer said it was fit for consumption. He, too [the retired veterinary
officer is a victim. The meat was sold at a throw-away price to the
villagers.
Another 100 villagers were on Sunday morning taken to the same hospital
where they were being screened and treated for diarrhoea and stomach ache.
Many more villagers who ate the meat were still being ferried from the
affected village to the Thika hospital.
The medical staff made up of nurses, an intern, and clinical officers
present could not diagnose the cause of sporadic vomiting and diarrhoea
that the patients complained of. The Medical Officer of Health, Mrs
Josephine Kibaru, who arrived at 4:30 pm, said the hospital had the
situation under control. She said there was a high likelihood that the
victims suffered food poisoning, because anthrax has a longer period of
incubation. Kibaru said they were conducting tests to establish whether the
infection was caused by anthrax.
Police deputy spokesman, Mr Dola Indidis, confirmed the death and said
investigations were underway.

[While this article does not give the proposed incubation period, given the
slaughter of the animal in question on Thursday with the onset of illness
most likely to be Sunday, at the most the incubation period is 3 days. The
statement that it is unlikely to be due to anthrax due to a short
incubation period is not correct, as the mean incubation period is 1 to 6
days. In the report of gastrointestinal anthrax cases in the USA due to
consumption of an anthrax infected cow, the incubation period of the 2
cases was 24 to 48 hours after consumption of the infected meat.

According to the CDC foodborne diseases webpage there are over 250
foodborne diseases that have been described. The incubation period
postulated in this current outbreak does not rule out many of the 250
diseases.

More information on this outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP
[If this should be anthrax it underlines the importance of a new animal
health programme that the Kenyan government has just launched against
anthrax and rabies, targeting 4 districts in the country's Central
Province. - Mod.MHJ
