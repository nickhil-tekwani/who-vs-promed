An outbreak of shigellosis has already been seen in Brooklyn, and now, the outbreak has spread to the suburbs. CBS2 was the first to break the story earlier this week of shigellosis in Williamsburg and Borough Park sections of Brooklyn. As CBS2's Weijia Jiang reported exclusively, a new outbreak has stricken residents miles away in Rockland County.

"We began to see it spreading in other counties, not only Rockland, as well," said Dr. Oscar Alleyne, director of public health planning for the Rockland County Health Department.

Alleyne has been tracking shigella infections - or shigellosis - a highly contagious disease that can cause severe intestinal distress. So far in January 2015, there have been 17 confirmed cases in Rockland County, and from November through December 2014, there were 49.
Alleyne believes patients may have contracted the shigellosis cases from Brooklyn, where 80 cases have been reported since November 2014.

"A lot of the times, there's a direct pipeline with families," Alleyne said. "To be honest, our boundaries are never really boundaries. People travel back and forth all the time." And just like in Borough Park and Williamsburg, most of the shigella patients in Monsey and Spring Valley are young children.

Shigella spreads through person-to-person contact, and direct contact with feces, or contaminated food or water. Symptoms include severe diarrhea, stomach cramps and fever, and the most severe cases involve convulsions and kidney failure. Children between the ages of 2 and 4 are at the highest risk.

In Brooklyn, Dr. Olitsa Roth told CBS2's Ilana Gold she has treated several cases in recent weeks. She said most cases are very mild and might just involve a bellyache, but some may be more severe. "The message is for parents -- if the child isn't feeling good, be on high alert and check their bowel movement," Roth said.

Alleyne said it is nearly impossible to identify the original source of an outbreak, but he said once shigella is in a community, it spreads quickly.

Doctors said the best tip for prevention is washing hands often.

Children in parts of Williamsburg and Borough Park have experienced a spike in cases of shigellosis, a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea, fever and nausea, the Health Department said. 87 cases were reported between 14 Nov 2014 and 13 Jan 2015, city health officials said. About 74 percent of the cases have occurred in children ages 5 and younger.

The infection, which most commonly impacts young children, is contracted by eating or drinking contaminated food or water, or by direct contact with someone with the infection, according to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

The city has monitored cyclical outbreaks of shigellosis in the traditional Jewish community since the last outbreak between September 2011 and February 2012, where 206 cases were reported, the Health Department said. The Health Department previously warned officials of a potential outbreak, first reported by CBS2, and expected to see an increase in the number of reported cases as doctors became aware of the issue.

Gary Schlesinger, CEO of ParCare Community Health Network in Bed-Stuy, said his office has been "swamped with calls" about shigellosis over the last 2 weeks, though he declined to provide a specific number. The cases at his office, whose patients are 60 to 70 percent Hasidic [a sect of Orthodox Judaism - Mod. LL] have mostly involved children ages 2 to 5, he said. Some parents are confusing the symptoms for the flu, and Schlesinger has been meeting with local schools to help combat the problem, he explained.

"Definitely there is an awareness going on about it," Schlesinger said. Locals should be careful to wash their hands after using the restroom or changing a diaper, keep sick children at home from daycare, and avoid any sexual acts that could lead to hand or mouth exposure to feces, the Health Department warned.

No doubt inadequate hygiene related to children is a good part of transmission in this outbreak as it was in 2011-2012, an outbreak from which I personally treated patients with shigellosis.
