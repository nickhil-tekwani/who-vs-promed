[Sheep pox has been regarded endemic in Israel for many years. Rahat, the location of the outbreak described above, is a Bedouin township in south Israel's Negev region, 12 km (7.5 mi) north to the city of Beer-Sheva and 18 km (11 mi) north west to Israel's previous sheep pox outbreak, in Hura, reported in July 2015 (see 20150707.3492821).

Similar animal husbandry methods are maintained in Rahat and Hura and flocks in both are assumed to maintain direct and/or indirect contacts and make use of common animal markets. Sheep recovered from the disease may carry residual virus on their fleece for periods up to and beyond 6 months after infection.

Sheep pox and goat pox are viral diseases of sheep and goats characterised by fever, generalised papules or nodules, vesicles (rarely), internal lesions (particularly in the lungs), and death. Both diseases are caused by strains of capripoxvirus. Most of the strains cause clinical disease in either sheep or goats; some strains will cause a clinical disease in both species (such as in Kenya). In Israel, only sheep are known to be clinically infected. In mixed sheep and goats flocks, only sheep are clinically affected. Mortality in adult animals is generally low (less than 5 per cent) but may reach high levels in offspring.

In 2006, a new, imported vaccine was introduced, and vaccination of sheep became compulsory in Israel, leading to a sharp decrease in the number of outbreaks. Israel's vaccination data since 2010, as currently available on OIE's WAHID interface, are the following:
(go to http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Vaccination; select disease, country, year).

Year / vaccinations in sheep / national sheep population
2010 / 524 032 / 435 000
2011 / 584 721 / 525 000
2012 / 651 087 / 525 000
2013 / 612 / 525 000
2014 / 0 / 435 000
2015 / 0 / 435 000

Details on the vaccination policy since 2013 would be helpful. - Mod.AS]
