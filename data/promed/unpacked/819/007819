We bring to your notice that the post is false. The post on the Nipah 3rd outbreak in Kerala (mentioned in the subject line) is a serious lapse on part of the public health team where the information given seems to be totally jumbled up with reporting of a new case on 4 Dec 2019, which is followed by news from 4 Jun 2019. This has been viewed seriously by the MoH, GoI, as it could have resulted in serious implications for the country, especially related to travel and trade and also under IHR(2005).

It is, therefore, requested to immediately withdraw the post and issue a corrigendum.

This has approval of the secretary (HFW), GoI.

There is no such outbreak now in Kerala, India. This a false report. I think that the 2nd outbreak was reported again, and it got confused as the 3rd outbreak.

I am from Kerala, and I have checked the data with the directorate of Health Services, Govt. of Kerala.

[ProMED thanks Drs Dhuria and Joseph for their prompt correction of the erroneous news report that was posted on ProMED on 5 Dec 2019, which, if true, would have indicated a 3rd case of Nipah virus infection in Kerala this year [2019]. As pointed out by the correspondents, the news article (https://stockdailydish.com/1-more-tested-positive-for-nipah-in-kerala-6-negative/) dated 4 Dec 2019 in fact extracted a previous news report about the 2nd case that was published in June 2019. ProMED did not post that news article at the time, but we have now identified the original source of the previous report as https://www.aninews.in/news/national/general-news/1-patient-tests-positive-6-negative-for-nipah-virus-kerala-health-minister20190606151244/. ProMED apologizes for posting the misleading news report. - Mods.TY/LXL]
