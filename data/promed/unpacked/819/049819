A USDA Fact Sheet on BSE, with general background information,
was included in "Spongiform encephalopathy... (6)", posted
earlier today - Mod.]
......................................

In light of the events taking place in the UK regarding BSE and CJD, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture has issued the following statement:
Subject: FSIS/APHIS Statement on BSE findings in the U.K.
This is APHIS' official public response to the March 20, 1996, statement
by the United Kingdom's spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee:
USDA Statement on BSE Announcement in UK
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection
Service and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service are
currently working with their state and public health counterparts,
the scientific community and industry representatives to review
current policies and regulations concerning BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy).
The United States has not imported processed beef or cattle from
the United Kingdom since 1989, and enforces similar stringent
restrictions on importations from other countries where BSE exists.
USDA's BSE surveillance program has examined over 2,660 specimens
from 43 states and no BSE has ever been detected in cattle in the
United States.
Live animals imported into the United States prior to the ban in
1989 for breeding purposes have been identified and are being
monitored every six months by USDA's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service. APHIS will continue to conduct surveillance
and enforce import restrictions to ensure against the possibility
of the introduction of BSE.
USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service is increasing its role in
BSE surveillance. The agency is expanding its current antemortem
inspection. Inspectors are being instructed to look for any
animals that show symptoms associated with BSE and follow specific
procedures to prohibit meat from those animals from entering the
meat or feed supply.
USDA shares the concern of the British government that more
scientific information is needed and supports their call for further BSE
research.
