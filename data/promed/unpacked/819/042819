Rabbit hemorrhagic disease, Australia
-------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 31 Jan 2014 from Dr Mark Schipp, chief veterinary officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Canberra, Australia

Summary:
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 8 Jan 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 29 Jan 2014
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Calicivirus
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Sydney, New South Wales
Date of start of the outbreak: 8 Jan 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Rabbits / 80 / 35 / 30 / - / -

Affected population: sudden deaths occurred in 30 out of 80 show rabbits, of various ages and both sexes. There were very few clinical signs prior to death. The rabbits had previously been in good health and were vaccinated against the endemic strain of rabbit calicivirus.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Rabbits / 44 / 38 / 86 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: Rabbit calicivirus has been used in Australia as a biological control agent to reduce rabbit numbers since 1995. Pet rabbits are usually vaccinated against the endemic strain of rabbit calicivirus to protect them. The rabbits in this outbreak were vaccinated. Testing on the strain of calicivirus involved in the outbreak identified a new strain not previously seen in Australia. Tracing and surveillance is under way to determine how many rabbits have been exposed and how widespread the virus is.

Control measures
Measures applied: no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
From the Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute (local laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Rabbits / real-time PCR / 14 Jan 2014 / Positive
Rabbits / virus sequencing / 29 Jan 2014 / Positive

Future reporting:
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.

[Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious and acute fatal disease of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) caused by a calicivirus (genus _Lagovirus_). A similar disease, termed European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), has been described in the hare (_Lepus europaeus_). Its aetiological agent is a different species of lagovirus, antigenically related to the RHD virus (RHDV).

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90 per cent) and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival, or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. The incubation period varies from 1-3 days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever. The clinical manifestations have been described mainly in the acute infection and are nervous and respiratory signs, apathy, and anorexia. Clear and specific lesions, both gross and microscopic, are present. There is primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea, and lungs.

Petechiae [small red or purple spots caused by minor hemorrhage] are evident in almost all organs and are accompanied by poor blood coagulation. In rabbits younger than 4-5 weeks, the RHDV infection course is subclinical.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.6.2 "Rabbit haemorrhagic disease," available at, http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.06.02_RHD.pdf (adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2010).

The following information was obtained from a publication titled Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) and rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV): a review:

"RHD causes important economic losses in the rabbit meat and fur industry and has a significant negative ecological impact among wild rabbit populations and indirectly on its dependant predators. In Australia and New Zealand, where the rabbit is considered an important agricultural pest, as well as a major threat to the endemic wildlife flora and fauna, rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) was soon considered as an agent for rabbit control.

"In 1991, a scientific research program was initiated in laboratory under quarantine measures to assess the host specificity and efficacy of the RHDV Czech reference strain (Czech V351) as a biocontrol agent. After approval of the Australian authorities, RHDV was released in the Wardang Island in Spencer Gulf, South Australia. Despite the rigorous quarantine measures, in 1995 RHDV escaped from the island, possibly transported by insects or air currents and reached the mainland. In less than 2 years, it became established across southern Australia. The initial spread was estimated to be 50 km per week. In some areas, a reduction of more than 95 per cent of the wild rabbit populations was observed, particularly in the more arid regions.

"In New Zealand, after a careful investigation on the benefits and risks of introducing RHDV, the government decided not to introduce the virus. The virus was later illegally introduced by landholders. Posterior characterisation of the New Zealand virus showed it to be similar to the Czech V351 strain introduced in Australia, suggesting that it was imported from there.

Nowadays, RHDV outbreaks still occur on almost all continents and cause significant mortality rates, being endemic in most parts of Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. As a general trend, it seems that in areas where the European rabbit is historically present as wild populations, RHDV is also present and endemic. In contrast, in regions where the European rabbit is mainly present as a domestic or industrial animal, the occurrence of RHDV (epidemics or rare outbreaks) seems to be correlated with rabbit colony number and density."
