Lithuania said Monday [27 Jan 2014] it plans a mass cull of its wild boars due to an outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] after neighbours banned pork imports from the Baltic EU state.

"The goal is to leave up to 10 percent of the current 60 000-strong (wild boar) population to prevent the virus from spreading," said Jurgita Savickaite, spokeswoman for the Food and Veterinary Service.

Non-EU neighbours Russia and Belarus banned pork products from Lithuania that are not processed thermally after the virus was detected in the country last week, she told news sources.

Lithuania's government is expected on Wednesday [29 Jan 2014] to officially declare a state of emergency in regions bordering Belarus, which it claims was the source of the virus.

All wild boars hunted in these regions, all close to EU neighbour Poland, will be incinerated if tests show they carry the virus, which is harmless to humans but lethal to pigs and has no known cure.

Lithuania also imposed a temporary ban on the shipping of live pigs out of the affected areas, fearing the virus could spread to local farms.

Interior Minister Dailis Alfonsas Barakauskas said the government will also turn to the EU Commission asking to finance a fence along Belarus' border to prevent the movement of boars.

[The introduction of ASF into Lithuania, with the potential of continuing its spread, was, in fact, written on the wall, since ASF spread throughout the western parts of the Russian Federation. ASF introduction into an EU Member State necessitates intra-community measures to prevent its further spread. The updated measures to be applied in such a scenario have been included in the recently (14 Jan 2014) published EC working document SANCO/7138/2013, titled: "Guidelines on surveillance and control of African swine fever in feral pigs and preventive measures for pig holdings;" see at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/docs/sanco_7138_2013_asf_wb_en.pdf. - Mod.AS
