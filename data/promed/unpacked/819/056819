At least 8 people are reportedly receiving treatment after consuming meat infected with anthrax in Zvimba. Sources privy to the development alleged that the disease has affected several cattle in the area, which is home to the former president Robert Mugabe. The affected people are from Kasanze and Chirau villages under Chief Chirau.

Last year [2018], following reports of the suspected anthrax cases, the government availed USD 30 000 towards the purchase of drugs and management of the disease.

Zvimba district senior veterinary animal health inspector Mr Chemhere Nyamangara also confirmed the suspected cases at a stakeholders' meeting. He said: "It is worrying that despite efforts to educate people on the dangers of eating meat of an animal that has fallen ill or died due to unknown reasons, people still eat it, exposing themselves to danger. People should immediately notify the Department of Veterinary Services whenever they suspect anthrax symptoms both in human beings and in livestock. We are hearing that some people died in Chirau and that cows are being affected by anthrax in Kasanze village.

We encourage people to avoid opening carcasses of cattle that die of natural causes to reduce contamination of pastures by anthrax."

[Zvimba District is located in Mashonaland West Province, in central northern Zimbabwe. It is primarily a farming and ranching district. Crops raised include tobacco, maize and cotton. Cattle are raised for dairy products and beef. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvimba_District.

Effective surveillance and control of anthrax primarily depend on the livestock owners' trust and respect for the veterinary service, whether public or private, such that they listen and respond. This has a strong impact on the efficiency of vaccination programmes. But if this respect is missing, the disease only gets reported when it generates human cases and deaths. This is a bad place to start, because if veterinary control and surveillance had been in place, you do not have human cases, and investigations are not badly retrospective. The lateness means that other livestock cases and outbreaks are already causing expensive losses economically and socially. Also, a single shot herd-vaccination in affected villages has limited impact. If you don't repeat vaccinations, there will be subsequent outbreaks in the area. Those herds must be vaccinated for a minimum of 5 years. And by having your feet on the ground, you learn what is really going on.

I don't mean this lightly. When we were doing anthrax research in west Texas, more people knew me than I knew. Traditionally laconic Texans, as we drove out to their ranch to look at and sample a dead cow, gossiped like fishwives. The owner/manager of a central feed store organised a group meeting for us with the owners of ranches with deer anthrax and neighburing ranches, which resulted in a very successful increase in knowledge of the true distribution of cases. Remember, us veterinarians have the advantage of tri-dimensional observation. We can see as the animals, as the pathogen, and as experienced humans. Medics see bi-dimensionally, missing animal vision. And to do this, one needs mud on your boots. - Mod.MHJ
