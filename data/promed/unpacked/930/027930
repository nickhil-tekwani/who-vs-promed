The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 19 Mar 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 980, of which 915 are confirmed and 65 are probable. In total, there were 610 deaths (545 confirmed and 65 probable) and 317 people cured.
- 236 suspected cases under investigation;
- 12 new confirmed cases, including 4 in Masereka, 3 in Mandima, 2 in Katwa, 1 in Kayina, 1 in Butembo, and 1 in Bunia; the new confirmed case in Bunia is a 6-month-old infant whose parents are in apparent good health. In-depth investigations are underway and will include, among other things, the analysis of breast milk to identify the source of contamination.
- 4 new confirmed case deaths, including 2 community deaths: 1 in Katwa and 1 in Bunia; 2 deaths at Butembo CTE;
- 2 new patients recovered from CTE Butembo.

News of the response

Evolution of the epidemiological situation
----------------------------

- In the last 21 days, 97 new cases have been reported. The 3 main households for this period are Katwa (33 cases, or 34%), Masereka (18 cases, or 18.6%), and Mandima (15 cases, or 15.5%).
- This increase in cases was expected, given the paralysis of the response in the town of Butembo after the armed attacks against the 2 CTEs. In addition, the community dialogue is starting to bear fruit. We are seeing an increase in alerts reported by the community, which makes it possible to detect patients more quickly.

International delegation
------------
- An international delegation visited the response teams with the Minister of Health on Tue 19 Mar and Wed 20 Mar 2019. The delegation was composed of Henrietta Ford, executive director of UNICEF; Mark Lowcock, under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs of the UN, and Elhadj As Sy, secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross Societies (IFRC).
- Upon arrival in Goma, they visited Heal Africa Hospital. The Minister of Health and the executive director of UNICEF continued their journey to Bunia, where they were to see an IDP camp located within the premises of the Higher Pedagogical Institute (PSI) of Bunia. They visited the clinic built in the camp to provide 1st aid to the many displaced families from Djugu in Ituri province. Finally, in Beni and Butembo, they visited the Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) and the ETC centers supported by UNICEF. Being immune to the virus, Ebola survivors are recruited from these to care for children whose parents are hospitalized in the ETC.

Vaccination
-----------
Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 89 855 people have been vaccinated. [See URL for total numbers in each location.]

- March [2019] has gone from a month with one of the lowest #Ebola counts since early in the North Kivu outbreak to one of the worst. Only December [2018] had more cases by the 20th of the month than March [2019] has. The cost of violence is more Ebola. @MinSanteRDC says things are improving.
- @MinSanteRDC did indeed report 12 new #Ebola cases today [20 Mar 2019], in 6 different locations. Oddly, one is a 6-month-old child whose parents have not been symptomatic. An investigation is underway. Doesn't say, but I assume nosocomial transmission has been ruled out.

One can only conjecture how the infant became infected, whether from asymptomatic family or while being held by others in the community, or in the hospital during birth. We look forward to further details. - Mod.LK]

- As I noted yesterday [18 Mar 2019], there's always a surge in #Ebola cases after violent events hamper the outbreak response. We're seeing that now. There have been 32 cases reported in the past 4 days. That's more than all full weeks since the week straddling Jan-Feb [2019]. Progress lost.
- Today [19 Mar 2019] there are 8 [more] cases and 3 deaths, 2 of which were community deaths (ergo more cases will come). The #Ebola totals are now 968 cases and 606 deaths. I feel so badly for the people in the response, who must be exhausted 7.5 months into this outbreak.]

[Reuters, abridged, edited]
https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-ebola-congo/congo-ebola-outbreak-spreads-to-city-of-bunia-idukkcn1r12vr
[Byline: Aaron Ross]

Health authorities in Democratic Republic of Congo have confirmed a case of Ebola in another city of close to 1 million people, the health ministry said on Wednesday [20 Mar 2019].

Bunia is the 2nd-largest city in eastern Congo to confirm a case of the haemorrhagic fever during the current outbreak, which was declared last August [2018] and is believed to have killed 610 people and infected 370 more to date.

The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said last week [week of Mon 11 Mar 2019] that the outbreak was concentrated in 2 areas and could be stopped by September [2019], but poor security in Congo's militia-ravaged east and community resistance to health workers continue to hamper the response.

The confirmed case in Bunia is a 6-month-old infant, whose parents appear to be well, Congo's health ministry said in a daily bulletin. Investigations are underway to identify how the child was infected, it added.

The cities of Butembo, which has a slightly larger population than Bunia, and Beni, which is slightly smaller, have also experienced Ebola cases.

[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/03/spike-ebola-cases-continues-drc
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

According to the World Health Organization's Ebola dashboard, officials today [Wed 20 Mar 2019] recorded 12 new Ebola cases in the ongoing outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The cases bring the outbreak's total to 980 cases, including 606 deaths.

The new cases have brought to an end the downward trend mentioned last week [week of Mon 11 Mar 2019] in a press conference held by World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD. In mid-March [2019], DRC officials were seeing 25 cases per week, half the number of cases seen in mid-January. But in the past 5 days, the DRC has recorded 44 cases and several community deaths, which increase the probability of the virus spreading among family members and close contacts.

On Twitter, WHO director of the health emergencies program Mike Ryan, MD, said the increase is likely due, in part, to the security challenges. After violence on [Thu 14 Mar 2019] in Biena, outbreak response and disease surveillance activities were once again halted.

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/03/eight-more-sickened-drcs-ebola-outbreak
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

An uptick in the rate of newly confirmed Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo's outbreak continued today [Tue 19 Mar 2019], with the country's health ministry reporting 8 illnesses in 4 locations.

In other outbreak developments, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office in a weekly report today noted 2 more infections in health workers, and though Katwa is still the hot spot, 7 health zones that have reported recent cases are points of concern.

Of the 8 new cases the DRC health ministry reported today [Tue 19 Mar 2019], 4 are in Masereka -- the site of a recent family cluster -- and 2 are in Katwa. Also, Kayina and Mandima each have one new case.

In its weekly diseases and health emergencies update, the WHO's African regional office said though Katwa health zone is still the main epicenter, responsible for 44% of cases over the past 3 weeks, 7 health zones have reported new confirmed cases over the past 3 days and remain a concern. Besides Katwa they include Masereka, Vuhovi, Butembo, Kyondo, Mandima, and Kayina.

According to the report, 2 more infections have been reported in healthcare workers, bringing the total to 77, of which 26 were fatal.

In other recent developments, outbreak responders have established a unit to coordinate monitoring and analysis of lost contacts in Bunia in Ituri province.

Also, the report had more details about recent violence in Biena in North Kivu province, where health workers trying to obtain blood samples from a deceased man with suspected Ebola were attacked, prompting a police response. The WHO report says a transit center in Mambowa, where suspected patients await test results, was attacked.

In summarizing the latest trends, the WHO said the outbreak continues with moderate intensity, and though the absolute numbers appear to be declining, reappearance of the virus in areas where transmission seemed to have stopped is a serious concern. It added that frequent disruptions from community resistance and loss of contacts to follow-up are driving transmission, but the result of proven and innovative health measures in many areas is promising.

"Response efforts need to continue, and funding gaps need to be filled by the global donor community," the WHO said.

- Mon 18 Mar 2019. 24 Ebola cases confirmed in past 72 hours
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/03/drc-24-ebola-cases-confirmed-past-72-hours
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) grew by 24 cases today and over the weekend [16-18 Mar 2019], including several case contacts who refused or delayed vaccination after family members fell ill.

Since [Sat 16 Mar 2019], 8 new cases were reported in Katwa, 6 in Vuhovi, and 5 in Masereka. Butembo, Kyondo, and Kalunguta also reported cases. Twelve new deaths were reported, including 8 community deaths.

The new cases bring the outbreak total to 960 cases, including 603 deaths. A total of 172 suspected cases are still under investigation.

On [Sat 16 Mar 2019], health officials in the DRC said the cases in Vuhovi likely came from a single family who refused follow-up care and vaccination after a family member contracted the virus.

"Following the last community death in this family, several neighbors and other villagers moved and asked to be vaccinated," health officials said, also noting that eventually the family members were treated at an Ebola treatment center.

The cases from Masereka are also family members of a confirmed patient who died on 4 Mar 2019.

Also, late last week brought the 4th violent attack on response workers in the last month, this time in Biena.

According to media reports, the attack took place after health workers tried to take a blood sample from a deceased man whom they suspected had Ebola. A group of young people attacked the workers, and police had to shoot at a crowd, killing one person.

Last week [week of Mon 11 Mar 2019] in a press conference concerning the outbreak -- now in its 8th month -- WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said local violence is the most detrimental factor to response efforts.

Situation update; data as reported by Tue 19 Mar 2019
--------------------------------
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces has recently shown an increase in the number of cases reported by week, after many weeks of overall decline. This rise is not unexpected and likely due, in part, to the recently increased security challenges, including direct attacks on treatment centres, and pockets of community mistrust, which slowed some response activities in affected areas for a few days. While Katwa and Butembo remain major hotspots, clusters of cases with onward transmission have been reported in other health zones such as Mandima, Masereka, and Vuhovi, which is concerning. Response teams are working actively in these areas to limit local transmission.

During the last 21 days (25 Feb-17 Mar 2019), no new cases have been detected in 9 of the 20 health zones that have been affected during the outbreak. Moreover, the outbreak is currently limited to 34 health areas within 11 health zones, 19% of the 128 health areas affected to date. During this period, a total of 86 confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (35), Butembo (13), Mandima (12), Masereka (8), Vuhovi (6), Kalunguta (5), Kyondo (2), Lubero (2), Kyaina (1), Mabalako (1), and Biena (1).

As of 17 Mar 2019, a total of 960 EVD cases, including 895 confirmed and 65 probable cases, were reported. A total of 603 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 63%), including 538 deaths among confirmed cases. Of confirmed and probable cases with reported age and sex, 57% (542/959) were female, and 30% (287/960) were children aged less than 18 years. Three additional healthcare worker infections were confirmed this week; cumulatively, 77 healthcare worker infections have been reported, including 26 deaths.

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO, and partners continue to monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the DRC, and in neighbouring countries. To date, all reported alerts outside the outbreak affected areas have been investigated or laboratory tested to rule out EVD.

- Mon 18 Mar 2019. Ebola simulation in 3 counties gives Liberia's health system a failing grade
[Bushchicken, abridged, edited]
https://www.bushchicken.com/ebola-simulation-in-three-counties-gives-liberias-health-system-a-failing-grade/
[Byline: Moses Bailey]

The chief medical officer of Liberia, Dr. Francis Kateh, said Liberia scored an "F" in a recent simulation of the country's resilience and preparedness to handle another Ebola epidemic.

The simulation was simultaneously done by the National Public Health Institute of Liberia in 3 counties: Bong, Lofa, and Nimba, with cases of the Ebola virus disease reported at separate health facilities.

"Couple of days ago, we had a simulation exercise portraying EVD entering the country. And what we were doing was basically testing our system to see how strong the system is if we were to have anything like Ebola or another virus hemorrhagic fever," Kateh said.

He clarified that there is no case of Ebola in Liberia; rather, the National Public Health Institute of Liberia and partners were testing the country's resilience and preparedness to fight Ebola in case of a reemergence of the disease.

Kateh said he graded the overall result of the simulation with a failing grade because there were a lot of lapses on the part of health workers who handled the Ebola cases during the simulation.

Considering the overall result of the exercise, Kateh said the Ministry of Health and partners will conduct refresher training on how to respond to Ebola and other diseases for health workers across the country.

The 3 counties, in their different presentations at the gathering, shared that the lack of essential drugs and personal protective equipment and the limited or lack of ambulance services, among others, were some of the challenges that reduced their ability to respond effectively.

Health authorities in the 3 counties asked that the government provide the needed materials to enhance their ability to deliver health services in a more timely and effective manner.

The county health officer of Bong, Dr. Adolphus Yeiah, underscored infection prevention and control as an important practice for health workers.

[NPR, abridged, edited]
https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/03/19/704765877/what-needs-to-be-done-to-end-congos-ebola-crisis
[Byline: Nurith Aizenman]

Recent weeks have seen an upsurge in direct, and often deadly, attacks against the health workers trying to respond to the ongoing Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo. But the pileup of incidents can obscure a crucial feature of the trend: the attacks actually fall into 2 very different categories.

In the 1st bucket are coordinated assaults by organized groups such as criminal gangs or the dozens of rebel militia that have long clashed with the government.

The 2nd category of attacks are spontaneous eruptions of rage by members of the community who mistrust responders when, as in a recent instance, they show up to take suspected Ebola patients in for testing and treatment.

Now there's growing concern that the very steps the government and the World Health Organization are taking to curb the rising violence from organized groups -- for instance, bringing in military, police, and UN peacekeepers to provide protection -- could sow further mistrust and fuel additional resistance from ordinary people.

If the current situation has taught the world anything, says Marcoux, it's that "we must put much more emphasis on community engagement, especially in areas that are not yet affected, so when and if they become affected, we don't face the same challenges."

- Tue 19 Mar 2019. Doubling down on Ebola
[WHO via Reliefweb, abridged, edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/doubling-down-ebola

Since the start of the outbreak, WHO has deployed nearly 700 staff to DRC. These frontline heroes include medics, vaccinators, epidemiologists, logisticians, lab technicians, hygienists, communicators, and others, all of whom are playing a crucial role in a complex and coordinated response.

Many of the responders have been deployed from other African countries, including Guinea, who sent experienced vaccinators to help train local health workers on using this investigational vaccine.

Ebola treatment centres provide over 350 beds for Ebola patients. WHO has deployed medics and more than 300 metric tonnes of medical supplies to support patient care.

Working with local groups, communities across DRC have been reached with information on Ebola. Teams on the ground are engaging communities daily. Outreach teams, made up of local staff and volunteers, have met with thousands of families in outbreak-affected areas to raise awareness on Ebola prevention, symptoms, and how to get help if a case occurs.

This has also built support for the response efforts, even in communities where security concerns run high. The vast majority of people who are eligible have chosen to receive the vaccine. Families are also working with authorities to perform safe and dignified burials, where loved ones have tragically lost their lives to the virus.

Over 400 people have been treated with new investigational Ebola drugs. In the context of the current outbreak, patients are being offered new investigational therapeutics under a clinical trial being coordinated by WHO. This trial -- a 1st ever -- is an important step towards finding an effective treatment for Ebola. The patients who choose to join the study are providing information that will help us know the impact of these therapeutics on recovery.

Over 43 000 screenings have been done at national and international airports. Alongside the response in DRC itself, hundreds of health workers, border officers, and other responders in neighbouring countries have been trained and prepared to respond to a potential case, should it occur.

In Uganda, over 4000 health workers have been vaccinated as a precautionary measure, as well as over 900 health workers in South Sudan.

Despite progress achieved there remain challenges. Funding for the response is still insufficient to meet the magnitude of the needs and the complexity of the situation. Katwa and Butembo -- where the majority of cases are now occurring -- remain major areas of concern. Recent attacks on treatment centres by armed groups put health workers and patients at risk. Such attacks are deplorable for their immediate impact on lives and for the risk of further spreading the disease.

WHO has requested and received further support from UN and local police forces to protect the treatment centres and patients. We are also working to engage communities to strengthen ownership of the response and will continue delivering critical work -- across surveillance, disease control, communication, and the many other areas -- to end the outbreak. WHO is committed to improving the health of the people of DRC now and in years to come.
