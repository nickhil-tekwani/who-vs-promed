According to the regional health director, Victor Echeandia, a total
of 83 Peruvian army soldiers in Lambayeque are suffering from food
poisoning.
"After examining the soldiers we can definitely rule out a dengue
infection. Instead doctors have diagnosed an acute form of food
poisoning and we are currently investigating the cause", Echeandia
informed.
"We have taken food samples in the barracks to find out if they carry
salmonellae or other bacteria". He said that 3 hours after they had
lunch on Monday [12 Feb 2007], soldiers started to complain of
[severe] abdominal pain, high fever, and diarrhea.
Eleven patients were immediately taken to a hospital and received
intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration. Two soldiers remain under
observation while the others continue receiving ambulatory treatment.
Echeandia said that on Tue 13 Feb 2007, [they will receive the final
laboratory results from the Direction of Epidemiology and will be
able to confirm what type of bacterium contaminated the soldiers'
food.]

[The etiology of this foodborne illness cluster is unclear. If the
lunch food was the vehicle, it suggests the classical short
incubation illness of staphylococcal enterotoxin illness. This,
however, does not generally cause a high fever and is generally
associated with vomiting rather than diarrhea. It is possible that
the exposure was prior to lunch.
Besides bacterial pathogens, norovirus is a consideration.
Lambayeque is a region in northwestern Peru, known for its rich Chimu
and Moche historical past. The region's name originates from the
ancient pre-Inca civilization of the lambayeques. Its location can be
