Paul Brown on CJD and blood
WHO & risks from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
Once again, the scientific evidence on Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is
shrouded in speculation. Last week, experts convened at the World Health
Organization to review recent research on transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSEs) and to assess the safety of medicinal products of
animal and human origin, particularly blood components (March 24=AD26). But=
UK
newspapers announced that "blood donors may pass CJD" before the conference
had even started. And the new WHO recommendations have already generated
controversy elsewhere.
At the meeting, scientists heard evidence from experimental transmission
studies and epidemiological data. Paul Brown, National Institute for
Neurological Disease and Stroke (Bethesda, MD, USA), presented data
suggesting that infectivity from CJD is present in whole and fractionated
blood. At present, blood and blood products are considered to be safe,
concluded WHO, since "there has been no proven or even probable instance of
CJD transmission from human to human by blood transfusion or blood=
products".
Brown has shown that plasma fractions, taken from mice adapted to infection
with human CJD, can transmit the disease when injected into the brains of
healthy mice. These data, which have yet to be published, confirm the
previously reported transmission of human CJD from buffy coat and whole
blood (see Lancet 1985: ii; 896 and 1074). However, "no-one has hitherto
examined all blood components including plasma fractions", says Brown. He
warns against extrapolating these results to clinical settings because there
is currently no experimental evidence to suggest that infectivity can be
transmitted intravenously. But "these data suggest that plasma, and in
particular cryoprecipitate, could pose more of a threat than we thought", he
cautioned.
