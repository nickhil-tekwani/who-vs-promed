Test confirms bat disease in west Maryland cave
-----------------------------------------------
State wildlife managers say they are restricting access to known bat
locations in western Maryland after a test confirmed the presence of a
disease fatal to the winged mammals in a cave near Cumberland.

The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) said Thursday [18 Mar 2010]
that 4 bats were infected with the fungus linked to White-Nose
Syndrome. The fungus causes lesions on the muzzles of bats. It appears
to wake them from hibernation before there are enough insects to keep
them from starving.

DNR Veterinarian Cindy Driscoll says the agency will implement a
regimen of restricted access and decontamination procedures for all
known bat locations. She says the disease is believed to be limited to
the mountains of western Maryland.
