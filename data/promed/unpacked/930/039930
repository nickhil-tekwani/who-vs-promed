Avian influenza virus in mammals spreads beyond the site of infection
to other organ systems
---------------------------------------------------
Researchers at the Erasmus Medical Center have demonstrated systemic
spread of avian influenza virus in cats infected by respiratory,
digestive, and cat-to-cat contact. The paper by Rimmelzwaan et al.,
"Influenza A virus (H5N1) infection in cats causes systemic disease
with potential novel routes of virus spread within and between
hosts," appears in the January issue of The American Journal of
Pathology and is accompanied by a commentary.
Avian influenza (H5N1) is of great concern because of the current
outbreaks in Asia and the potential for pandemic spread. This virus
is highly contagious in birds and spreads easily due to the
agricultural and migratory nature of the bird species infected,
including poultry, waterfowl, and other migratory species (See
commentary by Brown for more information). While spread of avian
influenza from bird to man is known to occur, as first reported
during the 1997 Hong Kong outbreak, human-to-human spread is
extremely rare. Thus, the disease events that take place during
mammal-to-mammal spread are not well characterized.
To assess the spread of H5N1 influenza virus in mammalian hosts,
Rimmelzwaan et al. examined cats infected via the respiratory tract,
via the digestive tract (by feeding on infected chicks), or by close
contact with respiratory-infected cats. The researchers, led by Dr.
Thijs Kuiken, then examined mucous membranes (throat, nasal, and
rectal swabs) and organ systems (respiratory, digestive, nervous,
cardiovascular, urinary, lymphoid, and endocrine) for the presence of
virus and viral protein.
As expected, all cats were infected with H5N1 virus and exhibited
clinical signs of disease (fever, lethargy, labored breathing, etc.),
and virus was detected in throat, nasal, and rectal swabs, regardless
of the original site of infection. Most interesting, virus spread
throughout the organ systems with virus being found in respiratory
and digestive tracts, liver, kidney, heart, brain, and lymph nodes.
Furthermore, examination of infected tissues revealed cellular damage
at sites containing viral proteins, providing an explanation for the
increased severity of disease in humans.
These data underscore the potential for influenza virus to spread not
only from the respiratory tract but also from the digestive and
urinary tracts, greatly increasing the possible routes of mammalian
transmission. Systemic disease has long been known to occur in birds,
with the fecal-oral route of transmission being most important.
However, this is the 1st demonstration of systemic replication in
cats, providing a cautionary tale for humans regarding how influenza
is spread and how the disease presents itself.
Rimmelzwaan and colleagues caution that because of the systemic
nature of avian influenza, "H5N1 virus infection needs to be included
in the differential diagnosis of a broader range of clinical
presentations than is currently done." In addition better
understanding of the mechanisms of spread, including possible
fecal-oral route in humans, "may limit the risk of H5N1 virus
developing into a pandemic influenza virus."

[The susceptibility of carnivores to avian influenza A virus was
first recorded in a paper published in the China Journal of
Veterinary Science in 2003, demonstrating that tigers had died of
influenza A virus infection in China in 2002.
Subsequently in 2004 during the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in
Thailand considerable mortality occurred among zoo tigers and
leopards probably as a result of ingestion of diseased poultry. More
recently, deaths of chickens and dogs were reported in a rural
village (Bozkurt) in Turkey, although the cause was not determined.
Now Rimmelzwaan et al. have used domestic cats as a model to
investigate factors affecting the spread of avian influenza A viruses
from mammal to mammal. Their data clearly demonstrate systemic spread
of virus in cats and multiplication of virus in several organ
systems. The wider importance of their findings resides in their
final conclusion: "....better understanding of the mechanisms of
spread, including possible fecal-oral route in humans, "may limit the
risk of H5N1 virus developing into a pandemic influenza virus." - Mod.CP]
