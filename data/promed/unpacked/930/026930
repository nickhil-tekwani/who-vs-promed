North Dakota's state veterinarian says the state's 1st reported case of anthrax this year [2015] should prompt livestock producers to take action to protect their animals from the disease, especially in areas with a past history of the disease.

The case was confirmed on Friday [19 Jun 2015] afternoon at the North Dakota State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. "Anthrax has been confirmed in a Grand Forks County beef cow," said Dr. Susan Keller. "Producers should consult with their veterinarians to make sure the vaccination schedule for their animals is up to date."

Effective anthrax vaccines are readily available, but it takes about a week for immunity to be established, and it must be administered annually. Keller also said producers should monitor their herds for unexplained deaths and report them to their veterinarians.

Anthrax has been most frequently reported in northeast, southeast and south central North Dakota, but it has been found in almost every part of the state." "With the precipitation we have had, conditions are right for the disease to occur," Keller said.

A few anthrax cases are reported in North Dakota almost every year. In 2005, however, more than 500 confirmed deaths from anthrax were reported with total losses estimated at more than 1000 head. The dead animals included cattle, bison, horses, sheep, llamas and farmed deer and elk. An anthrax factsheet is available on the North Dakota Department of Agriculture website at http://www.nd.gov/ndda/disease/anthrax.

Anthrax is caused by the bacteria _Bacillus anthracis_. The bacterial spores can lie dormant in the ground for decades and become active under ideal conditions, such as heavy rainfall, flooding and drought. Animals are exposed to the disease when they graze or consume forage or water contaminated with the spores.

[This is the 2nd livestock outbreak this year [2015] in the US. The 1st was in South Dakota in March 2015; see 20150327.3260622, which was a mite early. We can now presume that the US and Canadian anthrax season has opened.

My contacts in Fargo tell me that a 3-year-old crossbred Gelbveih cow was found dead by a creek. The cow was from northwestern Grand Forks County (ND). At this time, there is no count of total animals lost, but secondhand comments are that the producer had lost a few more after the initial diagnosed case. From previous reports of livestock anthrax in North Dakota, in spite of a very vigorous veterinary advising by NDDA, these outbreaks occur in herds that had not been vaccinated; sounds like Argentina! A benefit of these annoying sporadic outbreaks is that they remind the rest to not procrastinate and do as they were advised by Charlie Stoltenow and his extension colleagues.

Grand Forks county can be found in the northeast corner of the state on the North Dakota/Minnesota border and on the west bank of the Red River: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/northdakota_90.jpg. Livestock anthrax is more common in this part of the state and in adjoining Minnesota. - Mod.MHJ
