Please find enclosed a clarification on the respective case.
A press release has also been published (available at
http://bvet.kaywa.ch/de/tierkrankheiten/vom-seuchenverdacht-zur-entwarnung.html,
German and French only).

Clarification
-------------
The Swiss Federal Veterinary Office would like to provide the
following clarification regarding the case suspected as glanders,
which was today [29 Jul 2011] confirmed to be negative.

The affected horse was imported from Lebanon into Germany in January
2011 and later -- in May 2011 -- into Switzerland. After an outbreak
of glanders in Lebanon, dating back to January 2011, was reported to
the OIE in July 2011, samples were taken from the horse and the
initial CFT [complement fixation test] results were positive.
Consequently, the case was handled as suspected for glanders and the
necessary restriction measures were established, including
cancellation of a horse competition, leading to media engagement.
Samples from the affected horse and from 4 contact horses were sent to
the OIE reference laboratory in Jena (Germany), where they all tested
negative in all tests (confirmatory CFT and western blot). Therefore,
the event will be closed and all restriction measures will be lifted.

Glanders: suspicion cleared
---------------------------
Last week [week of 18 Jul 2011], horse sport activities were put on
hold in Switzerland due to the suspicion that a horse was infected by
the glanders pathogen, a bacterium not present here for more than 70
years. The affected horse was brought to Europe from Lebanon in
January 2011 and arrived in the canton of Solothurn, Switzerland,
through France and Germany, in May 2011. Following the information, in
July 2011, about cases of glanders discovered in Lebanon since
February 2011, investigation was immediately undertaken by the Swiss
authorities addressing the imported horse. The laboratory
investigation at the Institute for Veterinary Biologics at the
Vetsuisse Faculty, Zurich, showed a suspicion of glanders.

Glanders, an eradicated, notifiable animal disease and zoonosis, is
subject to the provisions of the animal health legislation. Any
suspicion must be immediately followed by measures to prevent spread
of the suspected disease. The suspect horse as well as contact horses
had to undergo tests, and the farm was put under quarantine. An
equestrian event, planned for the weekend [23-24 Jul 2011], had to be
cancelled. It was also found that additional horses had been
introduced to the EU from Lebanon. One of them was residing in western
Switzerland, and was also tested. All in all, various measures were
undertaken, causing concern by the horse owners.

Today [29 Jul 2011], a week later, the all-clear could be announced.
All tests at the International OIE Reference Laboratory, Germany, were
found negative.

For the background for the need for confirmation in a reference
laboratory, and the time involved, we obtained the following
explanatory commentary from Prof. Dr. Max M Wittenbrink, director of
the National Reference Laboratory for glanders in the Institute of
Veterinary Bacteriology, University of Zurich.

Glanders is a bacterial disease of equines. The acute disease is a
febrile systemic infection, the pathogens affects the mucosa of the
upper respiratory tract, the skin, several internal organs,
characterised by nodule formation and subsequent ulceration.

Animals with acute glanders die 1-2 weeks after the onset of the
disease. The acute form in horses is rare, most glanders cases are
rather chronic or even clinically unrecognized; there are horses which
appear perfectly healthy outwardly, while carrying the pathogen which
can be excreted. This phenomenon is the main reason for the lengthy
investigations and various tests required.

And what happens when a horse is found suspected?
MM Wittenbrink: Upon importation of horses from countries where the
disease is not satisfactorily excluded, such horses are sampled by the
cantonal veterinarian; a blood sample from the suspect animal is
submitted to the national reference laboratory. This is tested by
means of one of the OIE (International Office of Epizootics/World
Organization for Animal Health) recognized serological diagnostic
methods, to detect glanders antibodies. Such antibodies may be found
about 12-14 days after infection. If found, immediate measures to
prevent further spread are applied. However, confirmation from a
reference laboratory is prescribed. The international OIE Reference
Laboratory in Jena (Germany) applies verification by another test that
was developed as a confirmatory method for testing questionable
results. This process may take several days. Only if the review and
the reference test are negative, the all-clear can be given.

[ProMED-mail is grateful to the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office for
the firsthand update above (item 1); the transparency of this Office
is exemplary. The precautionary measures undertaken are fully
justified.

Detailed description of the test(s) applied in the National Swiss
laboratory and in the OIE reference laboratory will be helpful. In
case (commercial?) kits were used, the identity of the kit which led
to erroneous (positive) results deserves to be recognised, to prevent
similar false-positive results elsewhere.

It would also help to know where the Lebanese samples were tested; in
case more than one test/kit was used, have the results been identical?
