A patient was diagnosed in a Chelan County hospital with wound botulism, a paralyzing toxic reaction believed to derive from injecting tainted heroin.

Chelan-Douglas Health District spokeswoman Mary Small said her agency was alerted on Wed 30 Oct 2013 to the botulin poisoning, which poses no wider risk to the general public. The health district gave notice of the health case on the following day to local health providers and police in case more such poisonings emerge, Small said. "We just wanted to put out an awareness to people who provide service and work with people who are using drugs," she said.

Botulism is a potentially fatal bacterium-related poisoning that can occur from eating tainted food or, in the case of wound botulism, introducing botulin-producing bacteria through the skin. It is not communicable from person to person.

There are about 145 cases of botulism reported each year according to the CDC. About 20 percent of all cases stem from wound infections, and most wound botulism cases are associated with the injection of black tar heroin.

The toxic bacterium is believed to live within diluting agents -- "dextrose, burned cornstarch, instant coffee, and sometimes even dirt," according to a 2004 medical study -- introduced while processing the heroin. This means disinfected needles and clean injection points can't prevent infection.

Ten Americans have died of wound botulism since 2001. Cases have been reported over the last decade among IV drug users in the Yakima (WA) area, including 2 in 2010, one in 2007, and 4 others in 2003, but Small said this appears to be the 1st such instance in the Wenatchee Valley.

[The usual form of heroin associated with wound botulism is black tar heroin (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tar_heroin), which can contain a variable percentage of heroin; but, despite the name, what makes black tar heroin specific as a type is not actually its heroin (diacetylmorphine) content, but rather the greater mixture of lesser acetylated morphine derivatives, predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine) and 3-MAM (3-monoacetylmorphine). This is caused by the use of the antiquated Wright-Beckett process (c. 1874), which produces a relatively crude and unrefined opiate product but does not require the complex lab equipment, high-purity acetylating chemicals, or lengthy reflux steps necessary to produce pure heroin, making it attractive to clandestine drug producers.

Black tar heroin is produced in Latin America, and is most commonly found in the western and southern parts of the USA, while also being occasionally found in western Canada and Europe. It has a varying consistency depending on manufacturing methods, cutting agents, and moisture levels, ranging in quality from a black-brown, tarry goo in unrefined form to a uniform, light-brown powder when further processed and cut with lactose.

Users who intravenously inject black tar heroin are at higher risk of venous sclerosis (a condition where the veins narrow and harden, making injection there nearly impossible) than users of powder heroin, forcing users to inject subcutaneously. Injecting the drug below the skin can produce a local anaerobic, necrotic environment allowing germination of spores of _Clostridium_ species producing necrotizing infections due to _C. perfringens_ or toxin-induced diseases such as tetanus or botulism. - Mod.LL
