Higly pathogenic avian influenza in Senegal: Invalidation
----------------------------------------------------------
In a message received on 10 Jul 2002, Dr Abdoulaye Bouna Niang, Director of
Animal Production, Ministry of Agriculture, Dakar, informed that an error
was made in the monthly animal health status report for Senegal for April
2002 (see Disease Information, 15 [25], 104, dated 21 Jun 2002), and that
the disease in question was in fact Newcastle disease and not highly
pathogenic avian influenza
