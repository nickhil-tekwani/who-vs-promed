Alamosa County woman dies of hantavirus
------------------------------------------
A 28-year-old Alamosa County woman has died from hantavirus, the 1st
case of the disease in the state this year [2007], health officials
said. The source of the infection had not been determined by Tuesday
[08 May 2007], said John Pape, an epidemiologist with the state
Department of Public Health and Environment.
The woman, whose name and hometown were not released, died Friday [4
May 2007]. Pape said a preliminary investigation indicated she
contracted the virus in her home, which he said is not unusual.
Hantavirus is commonly spread through exposure to infected deer mice.
Humans can be infected by inhaling the virus during direct contact
with the mice or if dust or feces from mice nests is disturbed.
{Although deerr mice are wild, not domestic, rodents, they seek
shelter in rural homes during the winter - freezing in Colorado - and
leave their droppings behind when they go. Mod.JW]
Colorado typically has 4 to 6 hantavirus cases a year. Last year
[2006], the state had 6 cases, including one death; in 2005, there
were 11 cases including one death, Pape said.

[This report does not indicate which of the hantaviruses was the
etiological agent in this fatality. Presumably it was Sin Nombre
virus, and ProMED requests confirmation.
