A Dubai laboratory yesterday [Fri 2 Jun 2010] stood by a report that
states a Bahrain camel tested positive for the deadly infection
glanders, which has already led to more than 40 horses and donkeys
being put down.

Bahraini vets remain adamant that the highly infectious disease has
not spread to camels and even claimed the wrong test might have been
carried out.

However, an official at the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory --
a World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)-certified facility --
said it had followed all proper procedures.

"The tests we did are the same tests that are done on all other
animals and even humans if they are suspected to be suffering from
glanders," the official told the GDN on condition of anonymity.

The GDN reported yesterday [Fri 2 Jun 2010] that camel owners were now
demanding answers as a result of the UAE lab report.

Bahrain's chief vet, Dr Salman Abdul Nabi, remains adamant that
glanders had not spread to camels, but claimed authorities had never
received a copy of the UAE lab report. "I need to see the report from
the Dubai laboratory, if it exists," he said yesterday [Fri 2 Jun
2010]. "The test has to be done in a different way with camels than
with horses and donkeys. I feel a wrong technique may have been
employed."

However, Committee of Horse Owners and Breeders board member Hussein
Al Alawi -- believes 2 of his camels were suffering from glanders
before they were put down. Mr Al Alawi, who owns a camel farm in
Shakhura, approached the UAE laboratory when vets put down 2 of his
camels showing symptoms of glanders last month [May 2010]. He sent a
blood test from the 2nd camel directly to the lab because Bahrain's
vets never showed him the results of a test they did on the 1st camel.
Mr Al Alawi, who has already lost 6 horses to glanders, said he had
never been told what Bahrain's vets believed was actually wrong with
his camels. He also claimed around 35 camels were imported from Saudi
Arabia months ago, but many died after showing similar symptoms. The
committee is now demanding a full and transparent investigation into
the matter.

Glanders primarily affects horses, donkeys and mules, but can be
passed to humans and other animals such as goats, dogs and cats. It
was 1st reported in Bahrain in April 2010.

[The major hosts for _Burkholderia mallei_, the causative agent of
glanders, are horses, mules and donkeys, but other species of mammals
can also be infected. Glanders has been reported in dogs, cats, goats,
sheep and camels. Members of the cat family seem to be particularly
susceptible to this disease. Cattle, pigs and birds are highly
resistant to this disease. (Ref 1).

An official follow-up report, submitted by Bahrain on 20 Jun 2010 to
the OIE, included the following epidemiological commentary:

"The population of horses in Bahrain is about 4046 heads and 120 heads
of donkeys. All the animals have been sampled and tested for glanders.
Samples were sent to the OIE Reference Laboratory (CVRL). The total
number of cases includes 45 horses positive to CFT with clinical signs
that were euthanized and 4 positive donkeys which were also
euthanized. Most of these cases were found in Saar and Shakhoura,
located in Northern governorate. 251 samples were also retested and
gave negative results."
