New citrus pest found in Eastern Cape
-------------------------------------
A new citrus pest has arrived in the Eastern Cape's western region
and if it infiltrates commercial orchards it will place a huge cost
burden on hard-pressed citrus farmers. The public could play a key
role in restricting the new pest's movements while ways were being
found to control and eradicate it, Citrus Research International
(CRI) programme manager Sean Moore said.

CRI is spearheading research on the pest called "woolly white fly."
It is thought to have originated in Jamaica in the late 1800s and
from there it migrated, despite efforts to eradicate it, into the US.
Since then it has appeared in Europe, Asia and Africa.

It was 1st identified in South Africa on the Western Cape coast by
Stellenbosch entomologist Jan Giliomee [in 2009, see link below]. In
April 2010, its presence in the country was officially placed on the
lists of the International Plant Protection Convention [IPPC] which
seeks to protect crops and indigenous plants from invasive pests.

Moore said it was not clear how it had got into the country. South
Africa imports very little citrus and official routes are carefully
policed. The pest does attach to other plants, however, and it is
possible it came in on an ornamental pot plant, for instance.

[South Africa is the 2nd largest global exporter of citrus and this
pest could cause huge damage. The woolly white fly (WWF;
_Aleurothrixus floccosus_) is so called because, as the pest ages,
the insects cover themselves and their pupae with "woolly" white waxy
filaments. They are found on all types of citrus and several other hosts.

WWF rest on the undersides of fully expanded leaves and populations
can rise to 800 insects per leaf. Females may lay as many as 200 eggs
which may require 4 - 12 days to hatch or may overwinter. In warm
weather, the pests' life cycle is completed in about 21 days.

WWF sucks phloem sap causing the leaves to wilt and drop when
populations are quite large. Honeydew droplets, secreted by the
insects, collect dust and support the growth of sooty mould which can
blacken entire trees and also contaminate the fruit. Although the
black mould can be washed off, workers are reluctant to pick
contaminated fruit for which a lower price may be paid.

Establishing biological control has proved the most effective means
of managing the pest. Various predaceous mites such as _Eretmocerus_,
and the yuma spider mite (_Eotetranychus yumensis_) are said to be
effective. Insect growth regulators can also be used.
