HUMAN ENDOCARDITIS DUE TO LISTERIA GRAYI
========================================
We are currently treating a 40 yo female patient with VSD [ventricular
septal defect] and endocarditis due to Listeria grayi. She rides
horses. Any comments about the organism as an human pathogen?
Any experience with L. grayi and horses?
Thanks.
