An outbreak of cholera in northeastern Ghana has claimed at least eight
lives and landed scores of people in hospital, press reports said Monday.
The state-owned Ghanaian Times said the disease was thought to be spread in
the region by travellers from neighbouring Togo and Burkina Faso where the
disease is more prevalent. Of 124 people admitted to Bawku hospital, 17 are
Togolese and 10 Burkinabes, the report said. Bawku is situated on the
northern border with Burkina Faso and near the northern tip of Togo, which
borders Ghana to the east.
The report quoted the Bawku East District Director of Health Services
Alexis Nanbayefubah as saying that contacts were being stepped up with
political and health authorities in Togo and Burkina Faso to address the
problem. He said cholera camps had been set up in six communities in the
districts of Bawku and Bolgatanga, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the
west, to treat cases in outlying villages.
