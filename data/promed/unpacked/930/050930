I believe that [the figures were] wrong with regard to Sri Lanka's
current influenza outbreak [see: Influenza (23): USA, Egypt, Sri
Lanka 20101223.4519]. There is no evidence for a peak in early
December [2010]. The CIDRAP roundup quoted was based on a WHO
assessment from 17 Dec 2010, based presumably on information received
prior to that from Sri Lanka and already out of date by the time
ProMED passed along the information.

The current situation in Sri Lanka appears to be more serious. See
data from Epidemiology Unit, Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition,
Sri Lanka:
<http://www.epid.gov.lk/pdf/Swine%20Flu/Situation%20Update/Situation%20Update%2023%20Dec%202010.pdf>.

There have been significant increases in the numbers of cases in the
past 2 weeks and 20 confirmed fatalities in the past 3 weeks. When
one considers that the UK, a country 3 times larger, has confirmed
only 24 H1N1 fatalities this season.

The following report from the Daily Mirror suggests that the outbreak
is beginning to stress the Sri Lankan health system:

A pregnant mother who had been under treatment for A1H1N1 (swine flu)
at the Angoda hospital died yesterday [23 Dec 2010]. The patient from
Bowatta in Chilaw had obtained treatment at the Chilaw hospital for
several days before she was transferred in critical condition to the
Angoda Fever Hospital. Meanwhile, another elderly woman died of fever
at the Chilaw hospital. Doctors suspect that she might have died of
swine flu, but it was yet to be established.

A senior official of the Chilaw hospital said they were short of
medical equipment for treatment of A1H1N1 patients.
