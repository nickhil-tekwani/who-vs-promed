The 1st confirmed anthrax death was reported in Parbhani [district, Maharashtra state] towards March-end [2016]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anthrax has made a comeback in Maharashtra after 5 years, with officials saying that at least 10 sheep and goats in Parbhani district have died because of the disease. Locals, however, claim the toll could be as high as 150.

Anthrax is caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. Most forms of the disease are lethal, and it affects most animals. Humans can become infected through contact with an infected animal, by inhaling spores or consuming infected meat.

The 1st confirmed anthrax death was reported in Parbhani towards March-end [2016]. A sample for testing was sent to the College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Parbhani, on 28 Mar [2016]. On 30 Mar [2016], results confirmed the presence of the anthrax bacterium.

Dr Sunil Lahane, assistant commissioner (disease control) at the Animal Husbandry Commissionerate, said the current outbreak was confirmed in Bharaswada taluka. "Until Wednesday [6 Apr 2016], 10 confirmed cases of death due to the infection were reported from the area," he said. Local people claimed the toll was much higher, with some putting the figure at 150.

Most of the deaths have been reported from [flocks] kept by sheep breeders. Dr Lahane said as soon as the tests confirmed anthrax, the district animal husbandry department started vaccinating animals. "Till date, 585 animals -- 416 sheep and 169 goats -- have been vaccinated," he said. Carcasses of infected animals have been disposed of as per procedure, he said. Ample vaccine stock is available and vaccinations would be carried out in a 5-km [about 3-mile] radius of the village to minimise spread of the infection, he said.

As anthrax spreads among animals through spores that remain in the soil, district authorities have carried out incineration in the area as well. Parbhani has 159 538 small animals, including 25 902 sheep and 133 636 goats.

In 2010-11, Osmanabad [district of Maharashtra] had reported an outbreak of the disease, which led to the death of 8 animals. In 2011-12, 119 animals died in an outbreak in Pune, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar and Beed [districts in Maharashtra]. But since 2011, no anthrax case has been reported in Maharashtra. Parbhani has witnessed an anthrax outbreak for the 1st time.

Maharashtra suffered a mixed series of outbreaks in 2008 involving 205 cattle and 5 sheep and goats in 3 outbreaks; a bovine outbreak in 2010 involved 12 cattle, and a small ruminant outbreak with 8 animals; in 2011, 5 small ruminant outbreaks and 150 animals; and apparently none since. That 150 head may have died in this outbreak is not unlikely as such outbreaks only get reported after deaths have begun mounting up. The "10" could have been just in the flock from which the diagnostic samples were taken. Across the world sheep and goat losses are under appreciated, which is very expensive as rural families depend directly on such animals for their daily milk and weekly meat. The local veterinary authorities are to be commended for moving relatively fast in getting local stock vaccinated. - Mod.MHJ
