Two severe familial cases of botulism were reported to the health
authorities in Brittany, northwest France, on 11 Aug 2008. An
investigation was undertaken to identify additional cases, the
vehicle of transmission, and to put in place adapted control measures.

Methods
-------
Following notification of the cases, health authorities issued a
communication to French hospitals, antipoison and toxin centers, and
general practitioners to alert health professionals. No specific case
definition was used for the investigation; the health professionals
were requested to immediately report all clinical suspicions of
botulism to the local health authorities using the routine mandatory
notification system for the disease.

Serum samples from the cases and samples recovered from the food
investigation were analysed by the national reference laboratory
(NRL) for anaerobic bacteria and botulism at the Pasteur Institute,
Paris. The presence of botulinum toxin was confirmed by
intraperitoneal administration of patient serum to mice, and the
toxin type was ascertained by the specific neutralization technique.
The food history of the cases in the 3 to 4 days before onset of
symptoms was documented.

Results
-------
The cases, a mother (in her 60s) and daughter (in her 20s), presented
with gastrointestinal symptoms accompanied by dysphagia, blurred
vision, and facial paralysis on 9 Aug 2008. Both patients were
hospitalized the day of symptom onset with a rapid evolution towards
generalized and complete paralysis. The women required intubation and
mechanical ventilation. They remain in this condition in intensive
care as of 3 Sep 2008, with minor early signs of improvement. A
trivalent antitoxin (toxin types A, B, E) was administered to the
patients on 13 Aug 2008. This antitoxin was imported from a
commercial laboratory in Germany as botulism antitoxins are not
commercially available in France. An authorization for temporary
usage of the product was issued by the French Health Products Safety
Agency (Afssapsf).

The diagnosis of botulism (toxin type A) was confirmed for both cases
by the NRL, by detection of botulinum toxin in blood samples of the
patients. No other botulism cases associated with this episode were
identified.

The investigation of the food history for both women revealed that
they had consumed an industrially produced pre-cooked Mexican-style
"Tex-Mex" dish, chicken enchiladas, the day before onset of symptoms.
These chicken enchiladas are sold as a pre-prepared kit consisting of
several sachets containing a cheddar cheese sauce, a pre-cooked
chicken and vegetable mix, and wheat tortillas. The product is
consumed after reheating in a microwave oven. Microbiologic testing
of the remaining chicken and vegetable mix revealed the presence of
_Clostridium botulinum_ and a high level botulinum toxin type A
contamination (2.8x105 mouse lethal doses/g). The remaining cheese
sauce was negative for botulinum toxin.

The epidemiological investigation of the cases suggested that the
contaminated enchiladas had been mistakenly stored at room
temperature for 2 weeks between purchase and consumption, contrary to
the producer's recommendation of refrigerated storage. They were
consumed a day after the use-by date. However, the recommended
storage conditions on the packaging are not easily visible to the
consumer.

Risk analysis
-------------
The chicken enchiladas had been produced in France. The incriminated
batch of enchiladas had a "use-by" date of 7 Aug 2008. This batch was
distributed only in France. Other batches of the enchiladas as well
as pre-cooked chicken fajitas are also distributed in Belgium,
Switzerland, and Spain.

Stored production samples from the contaminated batch of enchiladas
as well as other batches of enchiladas and fajitas and other products
produced by the company around the same time were analysed and tested
negative for botulinum toxin and _C. botulinum_.

A risk-analysis carried out on 14 Aug 2008 at the production plant
concluded that the plant conforms to hygiene and safety regulations.
An investigation of the fabrication protocols showed that the
fabrication process includes a pasteurization step of heating the
product to 85 deg C (185 deg F) for 2 hours.

Public health measures
----------------------
The company issued a recall of the implicated batch of enchiladas on
12 Aug 2008. As a precautionary measure, this recall was then widened
to include all enchiladas and fajitas produced by the firm. The
population was informed of this outbreak through national
inter-ministerial press releases and posters placed in supermarket
chains. European countries were informed via the "Early Warning and
Response System" and an alert in the "Rapid Alert System for Food and
Feed".

In light of the potential role of incorrect product conservation in
facilitating the multiplication of _C. botulinum_ and toxin
production in the contaminated enchiladas, a generalized reminder
about respecting the storage conditions of such products was
communicated by the French authorities. The producer of the
enchiladas agreed to change the packaging of this and similar
products to make the recommended storage conditions more visible for
the consumer.

Discussion and conclusion
-------------------------
The 2 cases represent the clinically most severe cases of botulism
reported in France in recent years. Botulism has been mandatorily
notifiable in France since 1986, and 96 cases were reported between
2003 and 2006 (1). Only 2 cases of botulism due to toxin type A,
associated with the more severe form of the disease, were notified
during this period, compared to 51 cases of toxin type B (53 percent)
and 4 of toxin type E (4 percent) (1,2). A third of the cases
notified during this period were not confirmed (1).

The epidemiological and environmental investigations support the
hypothesis that the 2 cases ingested the toxin following incorrect
storage of the chicken enchiladas, which contained a strain of _C.
botulinum_ after production. Prolonged storage at room temperature
could explain the unusually high level of toxin in the chicken and
vegetable mix.

Intoxications with _C. botulinum_ producing toxin type A are often
associated with vegetable-based products that at some point contained
soil with _C. botulinum_ spores (2,3).

The thermo-resistance of _C. botulinum_ spores varies by strain and
according to factors such as the lipid and protein content of the
food matrix (2). Exposure to a temperature of 110-120 deg C (230-248
deg F) for between 0.4 to 6 minutes is necessary to inactivate 90
percent of a population of _C. botulinum_ A spores (2). It is thus
probable that the pasteurization step during the enchiladas'
fabrication process does not prevent the survival of spores present
in primary ingredients or potentially introduced during the
fabrication process. Thus, correct refrigerated storage of such
processed food products is essential to avoid germination of the
spores and toxin production.

Certain ingredients used in the production of "Tex-Mex" food
products, including industrially produced cheddar-cheese sauce and
home-canned jalapeno peppers, have previously been implicated in
outbreaks of botulism in the USA (4,5).

This family cluster highlights the potential public health threat of
_C. botulinum_ spores in incorrectly stored processed food products
and underlines the importance of clear labelling of storage
conditions for products purchased in the refrigerated sections of
supermarkets. In addition, the episode, widely reported in the
national media, has served to remind the general population in France
that compliance with food storage recommendations is a prerequisite
for food safety.
