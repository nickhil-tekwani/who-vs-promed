According to data published on its website, the Epidemiology unit of the Ministry of Health explained that in August [2017], 19 983 infections were recorded, in contrast to the 40 781 detected in July [2017]. In this capital alone, 29 421 cases of dengue have been reported since January [2017].

- Sarlahi district.14 Sep 2017.As of 1st Sep, 2017, as many as 40 people have been diagnosed with dengue virus at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH). These patients are from Lalbandi Municipality of Sarlahi district. According to the patients, several dozens of other people suffering from fever having dengue like symptoms are being treated in other cities including Dharan, suggesting that an outbreak of dengue is ongoing in that area. Sarlahi district is one of the areas worst affected by flooding this year [2017]. It has come to light that so far, the government-concerned body has not taken sufficient actions to address this dengue outbreak in Lalbandi, Sarlahi district. Last year [2016], nearly 2 dozens of dengue patients from another municipality Hariyon of Sarlahi district, had been treated at STIDH [ProMED-mail archive http://wmmb.promedmail.org/post/20161204.4658430]. Dengue usually shows a marked increase between September and November in Nepal [1].

- Kolkata. 9 Sep 2017. Deep Ghosh, who died on [Thu 7 Sep 2017], was not a case of the traditional dengue infection. The 13-year-old boy succumbed to dengue encephalitis, a rare condition in which the dengue virus infiltrates the brain causing encephalitis. City doctors said it is a rare phenomenon and at least 4 such cases have been reported in city hospitals in a span of 12 days. "Dengue is like any other viral infection with typical symptoms like fever that lasts 5-6 days, headache, drop in platelet count etc. But in dengue encephalitis, the patient's central nervous system is affected," said Agnisekhar Saha, paediatric intensivist at Medical Superspeciality Hospital and Institute of Child Health (ICH).Out of the 4 dengue encephalitis cases reported in less than 2 weeks, 2 were admitted to ICH and the rest to a private hospital off EM Bypass. Barring one, doctors could treat the rest and send them back home. The age group of the affected 4 is 12-16. "It is a rare condition. Children could be more vulnerable due to immature immunity and specially in the phase when the brain is still developing," said Dr Apurba Ghosh, ICH director. Unlike the traditional disease, here the virus infiltrates the brain, causing fits, convulsions and also altered sensorium. In most cases, the patient might go into coma requiring ventilation support. "The dengue virus seems to be changing its character. The virus rarely affects the brain. Encephalitis is caused by neurotropic viruses. Dengue is not a typical neurotropic virus. But this year [2017], we are seeing more cases of the virus attacking the brain," said Prabhas Pasun Giri, PICU in-charge at ICH. When dengue affects the brain, it induces encephalitis. While some doctors said mortality could be higher among patients with dengue encephalitis, others do not agree. "I came across one dengue encephalitis case last year [2016]. But this year [2017] I have seen 3 cases in a very short span. Since it is an emerging phenomenon, we need more studies to conclude on its mortality," said Abhijit Das, neurologist, AMRI. "Neuropathy caused by encephalitis is most cases is not reversible. In case of dengue encephalitis, the damage is reversible with treatment," said Dr Shyamalendu Chatterjee, former ICMR virologist.

- Guam. 1 Sep 2017. On Guam, mosquitos are a natural pest but never in Guam history has an illness been reported as a result of the pesky critter until now as the Department of Public Health and Social services announced the 1st confirmed report of dengue fever on Guam.
Public Health announced on [Fri 1 Sep 2017] that they have confirmed a suspected case of imported dengue fever on Guam, which means the disease was not contracted on island. Dengue fever is a disease transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito, primarily the yellow fever mosquito which is not found on Guam. However, the Asian tiger mosquito, which can also carry the virus, does exist on Guam. As a result, Public health cautions the public to be vigilant in preventing the transmission of the disease and eliminating mosquito breeding sites.

Source: Nikkei Asian Review [edited]
https://asia.nikkei.com/Tech-Science/Science/Portable-device-speeds-up-dengue-virus-identification


A team led by a professor from the University of Tokyo has devised a fast and cost-effective method of determining dengue fever virus types using a portable DNA sequencer.

Use of the palm-sized device will hopefully be able to speed up diagnosis at hospitals in developing countries and also help trace the path of infection.

There are 4 types of the virus that causes dengue fever, a mosquito-borne tropical disease. A patient with a history of infection from one type can develop severe symptoms if infected with another. The team led by Yutaka Suzuki, a professor at the University of Tokyo, as well as Hokkaido University in northern Japan, has taken MinION, a next-generation nanopore DNA sequencer developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies in the U.K., and applied it to the identification of the virus types.

The process starts with serum being separated from a blood sample taken from an infected patient. Ribonucleic acid in the serum carrying the genetic information of the virus is then detected and converted to DNA fragments which are amplified for sequencing.
The DNA sequencer can now read the DNA information and a computer linked to the device converts it into nucleotide sequence data. This can now be cross-referenced with a database of genetic information to determine which type of virus the patient is infected with. In partnership with local hospitals, the project studied viruses from infected patients and discovered that the DENV-1 type of the virus was
dominant in Indonesia, while the DENV-3 type was more common in Vietnam. The prevalence of virus types in different regions could help identify infection routes.
The handheld MinION nanopore DNA sequencer comes at a fraction of the price of existing solutions. Until now, identification has relied on conventional methods of amplifying DNA using a polymerase chain reaction or large, advanced genetic sequencers, which typically fall well outside health care budgets in the developing world.
