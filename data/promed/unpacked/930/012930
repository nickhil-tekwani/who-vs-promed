Two rare cases of botulism have been reported in as many months at Orange County Global Medical Center in Santa Ana, county health officials confirmed on Thursday [14 Jul 2022]. A hospital representative said one patient suffering from botulism was brought to the emergency room (ER) about 2 months ago and another came to the ER 2 days ago. Both were admitted, isolated and treated.

Botulism is so rare in the United States that an average of only 110 cases are reported each year. About one-fourth are foodborne, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. California, Washington, Colorado, Oregon and Alaska account for more than half of all reported foodborne outbreaks since 1950, said CDC.

Botulism can be caused by _Clostridium botulinum_ spores ingested or introduced into wounds. There is no person-to-person transmission, according to CDC. Since 1980, wound botulism mostly affects persons who use illicit drugs through the use of needles, says CDC. Virtually all the wound cases occur in the western United States, primarily California, due to the increased use of black tar heroin, said the federal agency.

When contacted Thursday morning [14 Jul 2022], a spokesman for the hospital said officials had not heard anything about botulism cases at the facility. But the Orange County Health Care Agency confirmed the cases that afternoon. County officials would not release any other information, citing patient confidentiality.

A Global Medical Center representative contacted the Orange County Register later in the day with more information, but was similarly constrained by confidentiality laws.

[It is not clear if the 2 cases are related and if they were connected to ingestion of toxin-contaminated foods or from being injection drug related. Most drug-related cases of wound botulism are related to black tar heroin, which is injected subcutaneously instead of intravenously.

What seems like a clarification on the following day by the hospital, a news report stated that the case was one person admitted and again 2 months later (https://www.ocregister.com/2022/07/15/oc-hospital-clarifies-report-of-two-rare-cases-of-botulism/). No details were again supplied.

Black tar heroin is heroin acetate. "Other forms of heroin require additional steps of purification post acetylation. With black tar, the product's processing stops immediately after acetylation. Its unique consistency, however, is due to acetylation without a reflux apparatus. As in homebake heroin in Australia and New Zealand, the crude acetylation results in a gooey mass. Black tar as a type holds a variable admixture of morphine derivatives -- predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine), which is another result of crude acetylation. The lack of proper reflux during acetylation fails to remove much of the moisture retained in the acetylating agent, glacial acetic acid.

"Black tar heroin is often produced in Latin America and is most commonly found in the western and southern parts of the United States, while also being occasionally found in western Canada and Europe. It has a varying consistency depending on manufacturing methods, cutting agents, and moisture levels, ranging in quality from a black-brown tarry goo in unrefined form to a uniform, light-brown powder when further processed and cut with lactose."

"People who intravenously inject black tar heroin are at higher risk of venous sclerosis than those who inject powder heroin. In this condition, the veins narrow and harden, which makes repeated injection there nearly impossible." [Researchers at University of California at San Francisco have found that the rapidity with which black tar heroin destroys veins, along with its gummier consistency, may put people who inject it at a lower risk of HIV infection because they may be forced to inject subcutaneously (rather than into veins), and needles must be thoroughly rinsed free of black tar between injections if new sterilized ones are not available. The study has also drawn attention to lower rates of HIV infection among drug injectors in which black tar heroin is the major form of street-available heroin, suggesting that this may be due to the need to heat black tar heroin to dissolve it (which also inactivates any HIV present in the solution) (https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2004/01/97479/black-tar-heroin-use-explains-lower-hiv-levels-among-injection-drug-users).]

"The presence of 6-monoacetylcodeine found in tar heroin has not been tested in humans but has been shown to be toxic alone and more toxic when mixed with mono- or di-acetyl morphine, potentially making tar more toxic than refined diamorphine.

"Black tar heroin injectors can be at increased risk of life-threatening bacterial infections, in particular necrotizing soft tissue infection. The practice of 'skin-popping,' or subcutaneous injection, predisposes to necrotizing fasciitis or necrotizing cellulitis from _Clostridium perfringens_, while deep intramuscular injection predisposes to necrotizing myositis. Tar heroin injection can also be associated with _C. botulinum_ infection" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tar_heroin). - Mod.LL
