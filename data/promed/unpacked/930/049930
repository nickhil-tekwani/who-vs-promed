[UK] Sheep face 'invading' tropical virus
--------------------------------------------------
Hard on the heels of the foot and mouth epidemic, a deadly new menace could
be putting Britain's 40 million sheep at risk. Bluetongue virus, spread by
a tropical midge, has already crossed the Mediterranean and is being passed
"like a baton in a relay race" from one set of midge hosts to another,
experts claim.
"It appears to have expanded its range northward and westward into areas
where it has never been found before," Philip Mellor, of the Institute for
Animal Health, told the British Association festival of science in Salford
yesterday. "If you hadn't been hearing about foot and mouth virus in the UK
in 2000 and 2001, you would have been hearing about bluetongue virus."
The virus carrier is a north African and Middle Eastern midge known as
_Culicoides imicola_, a relative of the garden midge found in Britain. The
virus replicates in the cells lining the smaller blood vessels of animals.
"It makes those blood vessels leaky and fragile, particularly in areas like
the mouth, eyes and feet." The consequence is edema. "You also get
hemorrhage," Dr Mellor said. "There will be an escape of blood into the
mouth [and] conjunctivitis, so secondary infections in and around the eyes.
There will be damage to its hooves. Sheep that cannot walk very well, see
very well or eat very well, die very well."
He said the virus could also paralyse smooth muscle, which could cause the
sheep to suffer inhalation pneumonia.
The virus has been identified more than 500 miles north of its traditional
range, and observers say a temperature rise of 2-C could bring the
infection to Britain.

The UK sheep flock could soon be at risk from a deadly virus called
Bluetongue, which has killed half a million animals in southern Europe over
the last 2 years. Normally, the UK is protected from the disease by its
cool climate. But as our temperatures warm up, the midge that carries the
virus is surviving further north. Sheep breeds such as Dorsets and
Merino-crosses are particularly susceptible.
Dr Philip Mellor of the Institute for Animal Health will present his new
findings at the Festival of Science in Manchester later today. He's been
monitoring the presence of the Bluetongue-carrying midge, and has found
it's now living in Italy and Greece, where previously it couldn't survive.
Dr Mellor told Farming Today that vaccination would be a likely control
method should British sheep ever contract Bluetongue, although there are
some problems with the vaccine. He said that the [UK] government is already
preparing a disease control plan for Bluetongue.

There are 24 serotypes of Bluetongue (BT) virus and a multitude of strains.
The strains in the USA are not very pathogenic. The disease is really one
of sheep, while cattle become infected by the virus, less than 1 percent
will show any clinical signs. However, in certain breeds of sheep, e.g.,
Merino, with certain strains of BT virus, mortality can be very high. The
current strains in southern Europe (different from USA strains) are causing
high mortality in local breeds of sheep. [It has been] used by the
Europeans as a "trade disease" with USA.

[Mellor's paper has been in the UK press for a number of days in
anticipation of his presentation at the British Association annual meeting.
Being vector-borne, Bluetongue (BT) has the potential to be a major problem
as it moves north, and especially since the vector hosts may change as the
infection rises up in latitude to take over previously non-BT areas. The
vaccines are not so efficacious, and BT is complicated by pathogenic and
apathogenic strains (i.e., serum titres without overt disease). This will
continue to affect trade agreements; USA-animal exports were banned because
of non-pathogenic BT. Clearly there is a need for better coordinated
surveillance throughout Europe and especially in those countries presently
without BT.
J. Anderson at the the Animal Health Institute at Pirbright developed a
good diagnostic test based on monoclonal antibodies, reliable for detecting
specific antibodies against all serotypes. Vaccines are presently not very
reliable, and there is a problem in that they must contain a cocktail of
the specific serotypes that may be present or predicted to come along. -
