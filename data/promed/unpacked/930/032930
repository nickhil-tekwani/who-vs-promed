I would like to inform you on the progress made by the European
Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS). The Report on
Feasibility Phase EARSS? was just released providing the first results. The
report [may be downloaded from the web site: <http://www.earss.rivm.nl>
[The new data may be found in Chapter 3 of the "Report on the Feasibility
Phase of EARSS"
About EARSS: Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging problem. To obtain
more comparable and reliable resistance data, the European Commission has
funded EARSS. This system, in which all EU Member States participate, is
coordinated by the RIVM (National Institute of Public Health and the
Environment, the Netherlands). EARSS is an international network of
national surveillance systems, which aims to aggregate comparable and
reliable antimicrobial resistance data for public health action. Taking
into account laboratory methods as well as epidemiological principles,
EARSS provides incidence figures and trends in antimicrobial resistance,
describes regional differences and gives electronic feedback, providing
basic data to stimulate specific studies to assess risk factors. For the
feasibility study of 18 months (April , 1998-September, 1999),
microbiologists and epidemiologists decided to collect resistance data on
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_; more pathogens will
be added later.
So far Over 400 labs participate in EARSS and send data via national
coordinators to the central EARSS database at RIVM. In the Report on
Feasibility Phase EARSS, preliminary results of the survey on
susceptibility testing methods and the first susceptibility test results
are described. The catchment populati on of the laboratories that
participate in EARSS is about 60 000 000, which is almost one third of the
total number of inhabitants in the countries concerned. The labs serve 450
hospitals, mainly general hospitals (76%) but also academic tertiary
hospitals (20%) and nursing homes (4%). Data on about 14 000 isolates of
_S. aureus_ from blood and on about 6000 invasive isolates of _S.
pneumoniae_ are expected yearly. At the end of the feasibility phase, labs
from 12 countries (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland,
Italy, Luxembourg , Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, United Kingdom) are
sending data. In the table below the period (3rd Quarter) in which the test
results for _S. aureus_ were collected as well as the number of labs that
sent data and the total number of isolates is given. The proportion of MRSA
was calculated for the different countries. All _S. aureus_ isolates that
were resistant or intermediate resistant to methicillin or oxacillin were
considered as MRSA.
In the report the findings of the feasibility phase are discussed. Main
conclusions are that EARSS is needed and feasible, and that it is essential
that it is a continuous system with on-going funding. Expanding the number
of pathogens under surveillance is desirable as soon as the data processing
has become easier. EARSS is already acting as a catalyst for national
surveillance systems, for example in Ireland. See also article in
Eurosurveillance Weekly, issue 45, 4 November: Development of a strategy
to combat antimicrobial resistance in Ireland
<http://www.eurosurv.org/1999/991104.html#2>. The report is being
distributed to all participating laboratories and [may also be downloaded
from the EARSS website.
