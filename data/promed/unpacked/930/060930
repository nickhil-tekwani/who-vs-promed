Seoul confirms 7th MERS case
-------------------------
South Korea confirmed its 6th and 7th MERS cases Thursday [28 May 2015], surpassing Iran as the country with the 5th-highest number of MERS cases in the world.

The 2 newly confirmed cases are in a health care worker and a patient. Both had been at the same medical facility where the 1st confirmed patient was being treated prior to his diagnosis from [15-17 May 2015].

The newly diagnosed patient was not even on the authorities' monitoring list, as the 71-year-old did not share a hospital room with the 1st patient. Their rooms were at least 10 meters apart, according to Yang Byung-guk, the director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The CDC defines "close contact" with a MERS patient that may lead to an infection as being within approximately 2 meters or within the room or care area for a prolonged period of time.

The man's diagnosis contradicts the previous explanation made by the Health Ministry, which claimed that MERS was less contagious than many other infectious diseases. Six of the 7 confirmed patients are believed to have been infected by the 1st patient, who was diagnosed with the disease after his trip to the Middle East earlier this month [May 2015].

The Health Ministry also announced that a potential MERS patient, who was showing a fever as of [19 May 2015], left the country on Tuesday for China via Hong Kong as the authorities failed to prevent him from going overseas. The man, who is currently quarantined in a facility in China upon Seoul's request, is the son of the 3rd confirmed patient, and the younger brother of the 4th.

In its defense, the CDC said neither the 3rd or 4th patient informed the authorities that the man visited them in the hospital room, where they stayed with the 1st patient, on [16 May 2015]. The potential patient also did not mention that his family members were infected by MERS when he saw a doctor for his symptoms on [22 May 2015].

The man eventually told his doctor about his family members' diagnosis on Monday [25 May 2015], and was advised not to leave the country as he may also have been infected. He left for China anyway on Tuesday [26 May 2015]. His doctor, who should have informed the authorities immediately on Monday, filed a report on Wednesday [27 May 2015] - a day after the man had already left Korea.

"We should have asked more questions to (the 3rd and 4th patients) and verified things more thoroughly. We regret this has taken place," said Yang Byung-guk of the CDC.

A total of 166 people, including the potential patient, were on board on the domestic flight that traveled from Korea to China on Tuesday [26 May 2015]. Among them, 28 passengers who sat close to the man were put on a special monitoring list. The Korean government plans to share the list with their Chinese counterpart.

Also, 3 flight attendants are currently quarantined and being monitored in Seoul since their return from China, the Health Ministry said.

The Health Ministry has been under fire for its poor handling of the potential MERS patients this week, especially after the diagnosis of the 4th patient whose earlier request to be quarantined had been rejected by the authorities.

In response to the public criticism, the Health Ministry announced on Thursday [28 May 2015] that all passengers arriving in Korea from the Middle East would be monitored for at least 14 days, the incubation period of the MERS virus. The Ministry is also organizing a new study on 74 individuals who may have been in contact with the already confirmed MERS patients earlier this month. Last week, the authorities only included 64 people in their watch list after completing their initial research.

MERS is known to be caused by coronaviruses, a large family of viruses that cause a range of illnesses in humans from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. There is no known cure or vaccine for MERS, which has a fatality rate of 40.7 percent.

More than 95 percent of the confirmed cases worldwide were in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The 2 countries have the highest number of MERS patients - 996 and 74, respectively - followed by Jordan, Qatar and Korea.

[2] China ex South Korea, suspected - media report

S China reports 1st suspected case of imported MERS
-----------------------------
South China's Guangdong Province reported its 1st suspected case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the National Health and Family Planning Commission announced on Thursday [28 May 2015].

A South Korean believed infected with the deadly virus came to China for a business trip on Tuesday [26 May 2015]. He has family members who are infected and had close contact with them back in Korea.

The 44-year-old man expressed discomfort as early as [21 May 2015] and reported fever of 38.7 degree celsius on Monday [25 May 2015]. He landed in Hong Kong on Tuesday [26 May 2015] and went on to Huizhou city in Guangdong Province via Shenzhen.

Health authorities put the man under observation in isolation and notified the World Health Organization on Wednesday [27 May 2015].

Of 35 known close contacts with man, no anomalies have been found so far.

MERS is a respiratory illness caused by a new type of coronavirus. The 1st case was identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. There is no vaccine or treatment for the disease, with its fatality rate reaching 40.7 percent.

[Another media report mentioned "Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said that authorities in Guangdong province found the Korean man on Thursday [28 May 2015] and isolated him in a hospital for treatment. They also isolated 35 people who had come in close contact with him, though none has yet to show symptoms." (http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/mers-suspect-case-in-south-korea-travelled-to-china-1.3091050).

From the unfolding picture, it appears as though there may have been significant spread of the MERS-CoV in South Korea related to the importation from the Middle East. At present it appears as though there are now 7 confirmed cases and another suspected case. One of the newly diagnosed cases today in the 1st report above is disturbing as the individual was not noted to have had close contact with either the index case or the index cases roommate. We await further information of results of epidemiologic studies. There have been discussions in the scientific community since the identification of the MERS-CoV of concern for the appearance of superspreaders... while there may have been superspreaders involved in some of the earlier KSA related nosocomial outbreaks, this current situation in South Korea may involve a superspreader, or better stated, superspreading event(s). That being said, one will not be surprised if there are more cases confirmed in the coming days.

[With the newly confirmed case in a healthcare worker in Hufoof (Hafuf, Hufof), it appears as the outbreak in Hufoof is continuing with apparent transmission in both in the healthcare environment and the community (perhaps in the extended household contacts of the earlier cases. There have now been 12 cases reported from Hufof since 20 Apr 2015, with today's case being the 1st reported case in a healthcare worker in this current outbreak.

The reported case fatality rate is now approaching 44 percent.

Qatar reports 1st coronavirus fatality this year [2015]
--------------------------
Qatar on Thursday [28 May 2015] reported the death of a 73-year-old man who previously contracted coronavirus - the Gulf state's 1st fatality from the virus in 2015.

Qatar's Supreme Health Council said in a statement that the new victim suffered a number of chronic diseases, but that he died from coronavirus complications.

Qatar has reported 4 coronavirus cases this year, including the man who died on Thursday [2015].

The latest virus fatality was reported in Qatar in 2013.

Also called MERS, the Corona disease has been reported in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Tunisia, Jordan, Egypt and Oman.

The virus, for which no cure currently exists, is known for destroying the lungs and kidneys.

It is presumed that long-term physical contact with persons carrying the virus can lead to infection.
