At least 10 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) have been confirmed at Homestead High School in Mequon in the past 2 weeks.

An email was sent to parents on Fri [21 Oct 2016] alerting them to the viral infection, which can be spread through sharing things like straws and cups.

Symptoms usually begin with a fever, poor appetite and a sore throat. A few days later, painful sores may develop in the mouth. That's followed by a skin rash on different parts of the body, according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.

HFMD is most common in children under 5 years old, but teens and adults can get it too.

Dr. Laura Marusinec with Children's Hospital urgent care said that while the age of the people infected is surprising, it can be easily treated. "It's a viral infection and very common this time of year," Marusinec said, "...basically, just symptomatic care and treating the pain. We use ibuprofen and Tylenol."

At Homestead, the staff will be comprehensively cleaning the locker room, weight room and shower areas in an effort to prevent the virus from spreading.

If anyone believes their child may have HFMD, they are encouraged to contact a physician.
