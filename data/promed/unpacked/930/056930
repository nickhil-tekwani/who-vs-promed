Labour's foot and mouth mistakes
--------------------------------
The official scientific inquiry into the foot and mouth crisis will
recommend a three-pronged attack to tackle future outbreaks -- vaccination
in the first instance; safeguards to ensure that disease control tactics
are not influenced by party political considerations; and better livestock
disease surveillance.
The Telegraph has learned that the report from the Government-appointed
inquiry, headed by Sir Brian Follett for the Royal Society, will say that
the slaughter policy that cost 8 billion BP and led to the deaths of more
than 10 million animals would be "untenable" in future as animal exports
are worth only about 100 million BP a year.
Potentially the most damning tacit criticism of the handling of last year's
epidemic contained in the 136-page report, which is due to be published on
Tuesday, is that the contingency plan for dealing with an outbreak should
be debated before Parliament to ensure ministers do not avoid implementing
measures for political reasons.
The recommendation is believed to have been drawn up in response to
suggestions that the Government delayed calling in the military in the
run-up to the election last year because it would have signalled that the
outbreak had become a crisis. One of the key recommendations of the
Northumberland Report into the 1967-68 foot and mouth outbreak was to
involve the military at the outset, but this recommendation was ignored
when the contingency plan, designed to deal with just 10 outbreaks, was
implemented last year. Although the military was consulted from the outset,
it was not brought in until day 25 of the epidemic.
To ensure that accusations of political meddling cannot be made in the
future, the Royal Society report says that "planning of a high order" and
"an executive empowered by wide acceptance of the strategies being adopted"
are needed to handle outbreaks of infectious diseases.
The report says its authors have become "convinced" during the course of
the 11-month inquiry that "no longer is it sufficient for plans to be
issued by the executive alone, largely because some policies are viewed as
controversial by one stakeholder or another and this weakens the ability to
combat the disease invasion".
A source close to the inquiry said yesterday: "A key finding is that to
beat the disease one must act fast and decisively. "The recommendation to
debate contingency plans in front of Parliament is to stop any obstruction
- whether for politically sensitive or any other reasons -- from impeding
the tactics needed to stop disease spreading."
Evidence seen by the Royal Society inquiry also showed that vaccination
would be expected to stop the disease in its tracks within 30 days. Last
year, it took seven months to bring foot and mouth under control using
slaughter in Britain. Vaccination brought the disease under control within
eight days in Holland.
The report outlines a principle of vaccination using marker vaccines and
tests to combat future outbreaks and also concerns about the difficulty of
distinguishing between animals carrying antibodies because of infection and
those carrying antibodies because of vaccination.
The report will also point out that, following a change in rules by the
Paris-based international animal health bureau, the Office International
Epizooties [OIE], vaccination would not delay the resumption of exports
much longer than a slaughter control policy.
The Royal Society report is expected to recommend a policy of vaccination
within a 10km radius around any future outbreak, using marker tests after
vaccination to weed out infected animals. As a double precaution, if any
animal within a herd or flock tests positive for infection, then the report
is expected to advocate culling of that entire herd.
The report will say that further research is needed to ensure Britain is
protected against future outbreaks of foot and mouth, and other exotic
animal diseases. It will recommend that a Centre of Exotic Animal Diseases,
independent of the Government's Institute of Animal Disease at Pirbright in
Surrey, is set up. The estimated cost of this centre is understood to be
220 to 250 million pounds.
But Defra is not entirely supportive. It has told Sir Brian that it favours
an animal health overbody, which it estimates would cost around 100 million
pounds to oversee the various Government agencies responsible for animal
health.

[Although the Telegraph's early report on expected recommendations of the
Royal Society's Inquiry seem to be reliable, we prefer to wait with
comments until the official publication of the full document.
The Royal Society, founded in 1660, has 3 roles, as the UK academy of
science, as a learned Society, and as a funding agency. By virtue of its
independent status and its body of some 1300 Fellows and Foreign Members
covering all scientific disciplines, the Society is uniquely placed to
represent the interests of top quality science and technology in its
interactions with government, the public and the media. One of its
activities throughout its existence has been "the production of
authoritative statements and reports which provide incisive advice to
government and the public on key issues in science and technology".
The Royal Society launched the "Inquiry into Infectious Diseases in
Livestock" (IDL) on 9 Aug 2001, to focus on scientific issues relating to
the transmission, prevention and control of infectious diseases in
livestock. The Inquiry published 3 progress reports - on 8 Oct 2001, 21 Nov
2001 and 24 Jan 2002.
The Inquiry was chaired by Professor Sir Brian Follett FRS, University of
Oxford and former Vice Chancellor of the University of Warwick. Sir Brian's
academic career was in research, with a particular interest in reproductive
physiology and endocrinology.
The other members of the Inquiry are:
-Mr Peter Allen, farmer and chairman of the National Farmers' Union Less
Favoured Areas Committee;
-Professor Patrick Bateson FRS, Provost of King's College, University of
Cambridge, biological secretary of the Royal Society;
-Mr David Black, practicing Veterinarian;
-Professor Fred Brown FRS, US Department of Agriculture, Plum Island Animal
Disease Center;
-Mr Roger Eddy, senior vice president of the Royal College of Veterinary
Surgeons, and practicing veterinarian;
-Ms Suzi Leather, deputy chair, Food Standards Agency;
-Professor Simon Levin, Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,
Princeton University;
-Professor Karl Linklater, Principal, Scottish Agricultural College;
-Ms Jeanette Longfield, Coordinator of Sustain (The Alliance for Better
Food and Farming);
-Professor Ian McConnell, Dept of Clinical Veterinary Medicine, University
of Cambridge;
-Dr Angela Maclean, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford;
-Professor Andrew McMichael FRS, Weatherall Institute of Molecular
Medicine, University of Oxford;
-Dr Jenny Mumford, Animal Health Trust, Newmarket;
-Professor Robin Weiss FRS, Windeyer Institute of Medical Science,
University College London.
The final report and evidence will be published on Tuesday 16 July 2002 and
will be available to download from 11am from the web-site
<http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/inquiry/index.html>. The publication of the last
official inquiry -- "Lessons learned report" -- is expected during July as
well. Further details on the 3 main UK inquiries related to the FMD
outbreak of 2001 can be seen in ProMED-mail posting 20020630.4642 - Mod. AS]
