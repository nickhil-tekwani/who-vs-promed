The death of a man, a 35 year old chiropractor from Montauk, who
succumbed to a short illness on Friday [17 Jun 2011], has sparked a
town-wide scare that the [a] rodentborne hantavirus has returned to
the South Fork.

The panic was set off after the East End Foundation, which is
fundraising for the man's wife and their 3 young children, sent flyers
over the weekend that said the man had been cleaning out his basement
when he contracted a deadly virus. But the alert might have been
premature. Shira Barzilay, a spokeswoman for the wife, said the cause
the death has not yet been confirmed.

Grace McGovern of the Suffolk County Department of Health said
whether the [a] hantavirus is being looked at as a cause of death
could not be confirmed yet. "I would imagine many things are being
investigated," she said, adding that the medical examiner's office
would have to make a determination 1st.

Hantavirus[es] is [are] transmitted by airborne particles originating
from rodent feces or urine. If people breath in the particles, they
can become infected. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention [CDC], infection with hantavirus[es] can progress to
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), which has a mortality rate of 38
per cent.

Barzilay said a pest control company had inspected the victim's house
and had found no evidence of mouse droppings.

There are a small number of hantavirus infection cases. A total of
560 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome were reported in the United
States through 15 Dec 2010.

CDC said early symptoms include fatigue, fever and muscle aches,
especially in the large muscle groups -- thighs, hips, back, and
sometimes shoulders. Headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal
problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are
experienced in about half the patients.

All cases of infection have to be reported to the center's Viral
Special Pathogens Branch.

The victim, who was otherwise healthy, had been sick for about 8
days, Barzilay said. The family thought he had Lyme disease or some
sort of mild virus. On Friday morning [17 Jun 2011], his family called
for an ambulance. He was taken to the hospital at about 3 a.m. and
died around 7:45 a.m., she said.

The [a] hantavirus [infection] has been linked to at least 2 other
deaths on the East End, though it's been more than 16 years since the
last one.

In January 1994, a 22 year old Brown University student who lived on
Shelter Island, died from [a] hantavirus [infection]. According to The
Daily News, investigators later isolated the hantavirus in a mouse
trapped near the student's house.

In 1995, a 25 year old landscaper from Bridgehampton, died after he
was working around some mouse droppings.

Hantavirus kills Long Island man, say officials
-----------------------------------------------
A 35 year old chiropractor from Montauk died at Southampton Hospital
on June 17, after being brought in by ambulance earlier in the day
with a high fever and difficulty breathing. He had been intermittently
ill for several days prior, according to East Hampton Press.

State and local health officials have confirmed Hartstein died from
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a rodentborne viral disease.

Officials suspect that he had contracted hantavirus from mouse
droppings in the basement of his home, which he had been cleaning
recently. The State Department of Health, Suffolk County Health
Department and federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are
investigating the incident, but at this time, it appears to be an
isolated case.

HPS is an infection of the lungs caused by several different
hantaviruses, a microbe that may be present in the urine, droppings or
saliva of infected rodents. Humans can become infected if they inhale
microscopic particles from the droppings or urine of infected rodents.
There are no known cases of human-to-human transmission of hantavirus,
and pets and insects are not believed to have a role in transmission.

Cases of hantavirus have been rare and sporadic since the first human
hantavirus infections were diagnosed in the south west United States
in 1993, but they can cause serious illness and could potentially be
fatal. To date, CDC has confirmed six cases nationwide in 2011. There
were 20 confirmed cases nationwide in 2010 and 20 in 2009,
predominantly in the western US.

Since 1995, there have been two cases of HPS in New York State,
including the patient most recently identified in Suffolk County. Both
patients died from the disease. In the mid-1990s, two other cases of
HPS were found in residents of other states who had potential exposure
in New York.

Symptoms of HPS include high fever, muscle aches, coughing, and
headache, which may appear between one and five weeks after exposure
to the virus. Respiratory problems can worsen after several days, and
the lungs may fill up with fluids, potentially causing respiratory
failure or shock.

Suffolk County residents who have questions about rodent infestation
should call the Suffolk County Department of Health Services at
631-852-5900 (Mon to Fri, 8:30 a.m.- 4:30 p.m.). Additional
information about infestation is also available from CDC at
http://www.cdc.gov/rodents/index.html and
http://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/index.html.

[As is often the case with reports of hantavirus infections, this
report does not indicate which hantavirus was involved in this case.
There are 3 hantaviruses likely to occur in New York: Sin Nombre
virus, Monongahela virus and New York virus. All 3 can cause HPS. The
rodent host of Sin Nombre and Monongahela viruses is _Peromyscus
maniculatus_, and _P. leucopus_ is the host of New York virus.
