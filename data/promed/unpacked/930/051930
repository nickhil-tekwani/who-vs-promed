Regarding canine leptospirosis in Australia, I am not sure their current
quarantine requirements are sufficient to prevent the introduction of
infected dogs. Unless there has been some recent change in importation
requirements, dogs are only required to be serologically tested for
serovars _canicola_ and _icterohemorrhagiae_ but not the more common
serovars (_grippotyphosa_ and _pomona_) that are causing problems in the USA.
