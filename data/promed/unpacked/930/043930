Another case of bovine tuberculosis turns up in a Beltrami County
-----------------------------------------------
The Minnesota Board of Animal Health announced Tuesday [1 Nov 2006]
that investigators have found bovine tuberculosis in a 7th herd in Minnesota.
The case was found in one cow in Beltrami County, which is, with
Roseau County, one of only 2 counties in northwestern Minnesota in
which the disease has been discovered.
According to the Board of Animal Health, the herd is small and has
had minimal movement, boding well for the containment of this case.
Minnesota will not be able to apply for TB-free accreditation until 2
years after the elimination of its last infected herd.
Although each new herd discovery pushes that period back, Minnesota
state veterinarian Dr. Bill Hartmann says the Board of Animal Health
will remain diligent in its tests and efforts to eradicate the
disease. "Finding another positive herd will reset our timeline for
regaining status, but for the sake of Minnesota's cattle industry, we
cannot leave a single infected herd undiscovered," he says.
The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources will contribute to the
board's efforts by collecting a planned 5000 samples from white-tail
deer killed by hunters this fall [2006]. Two deer have tested
positive for bovine TB within a mile of the infected cattle herd this
past year [2006].

[Minnesota has a testing plan to rout out this disease, as evidenced
by the finding of this animal. However, to also have deer infected is
certainly reminiscent of Michigan and their TB situation.
Tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium bovis_.
Although this bacterium primarily affects bovines, it can affect a
wide range of mammals, including humans, swine, and deer. - Mod.TG]
