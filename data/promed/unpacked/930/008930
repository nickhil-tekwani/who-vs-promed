Encephalitis, a fatal disease, which causes the inflammation of the
brain, has taken 88 lives in Gorakhpur.

In the past few months, almost 372 patients have been admitted in
Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Hospital out of which 88 have lost their lives
because of this dreadful disease.

Most of the patients fall in the age group of 6 months to 12 years.
The patients admitted in the hospital are mostly virus infected.
"Presently, the cases that are coming in Gorakhpur are mostly virus
infected cases. The most common viruses are enterovirus and
coxsackievirus. The symptoms are almost same, but the disease is
fatal which leaves the person paralysed even if cured. Near 10
percent of kids infected by this disease are mentally or physically
crippled," said Sunil Kumar Arya, a doctor of the BRD Hospital.

The symptoms are very common and the residents fail to recognise the
fact that a mild fever can prove fatal. "My child had fever
initially, then he started vomiting, then there was swelling. Now,
the condition is better, but the fever is coming frequently," said a
patient's mother.

According to patients, almost 4-5 children lose their lives due to
this deadly disease. "Daily 8-10 kids are infected with brain fever
are coming here and daily 4-5 kids are losing their lives," said a
patient's father.

This disease is almost endemic to the region and immediate measures
are required to restrain the spread of the infection any further.

Encephalitis is commonly known as brain fever. Japanese encephalitis
virus causes the disease and the virus is transmitted to humans by
culicine mosquitoes.

[It is not clear if all the reported cases are due to Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV) infection, or if the other viruses mentioned
(enterovirus and coxsackievirus) are also involved, nor if Japanese
encephalitis virus cases have been laboratory confirmed. It would be
of interest to know if any of these patients have been vaccinated
against JEV, or if local health authorities are planning a
vaccination campaign.
