U.N.: Culling wild birds ineffective in stopping flu
-----------------------------------------------
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says controlling avian
influenza in poultry is the most effective public health measure.
Juan Lubroth, an FAO officer in charge of infectious animal diseases, said
culling wild birds is likely to be ineffective. Viet Nam has reportedly
begun attempting to cull birds in Ho Chi Minh City.
"Wild bird species found in and around cities are different from the
wetland waterfowl that have been identified as carriers of the avian
influenza virus," Lubroth said.
The FAO recommends improved veterinary services, emergency response and the
culling of domesticated fowl exposed to the disease as the most effective
means of controlling bird flu. More than 60 people have died of avian
influenza, mostly in Southeast Asia. So far, all humans infected appear to
have gotten the disease from domestic poultry.

Re: Avian Influenza - Eurasia (85): Wild Birds, Romania
-----------------------------------------------
You have asked about the precise zoological identity of the wild birds
infected with HPAI H5, about which Romania notified the OIE (in follow-up
reports No 5, 6 and 10).
Infection has so far been detected in wild birds of 4 species. They are:
1. Lesser White-fronted Goose, _Anser erythropus_;
2. Great blue heron, _Ardea herodias_;
3. Mute swan, _Cygnus olor_;
4. Common moorhen, _Gallinula chloropus_.

[The information expediently provided by NSVFSA (National Sanitary
Veterinary and Food Safety Authority, Bucharest) upon our request is
gratefully acknowledged. Only one of the described species, namely the Mute
Swan, _Cygnus olor_, has been included in previous lists of infected wild
birds. Have these birds been sedentary or migratory?! This question remains
unanswered. - Mod.AS]
