[The report includes a useful map showing all the affected counties in central and southern Texas. Many Texas counties are still suffering a severe rain deficit, especially west of San Antonio, which will limit the distribution of this vectorborne infection. This may explain why there have been no further cases in Kinney County, which just enjoyed a brief 1-inch rainfall. - Mod.MHJ
