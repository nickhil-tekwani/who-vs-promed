[This release provides some background to what has been posted already. I
will contact Mike Donoghue to see that we get regular updates. - Mod.MHJ
The following scientific update was written by Department of Conservation
marine mammal expert Mike Donoghue and posted [2.2.98 on the MARMAM
bulletin board on marine mammals on the Internet. The MARMAM bulletin board
orginates from the University of Victoria in British Colombia and is
available to a large network of marine mammal experts from around the world.
NEW ZEALAND SEA LION MASS MORTALITIES
A serious mass mortality event is currently sweeping through the two main
breeding colonies of the New Zealand (Hooker's) sea lion (Phocarctos
hookeri), with 30-40% of this year's pups already dead, and indications of
increasing mortalities amongst adult females.
The New Zealand sea lion is found only in New Zealand waters and is one of
the world's rarest seal species. In 1997, based on pup production
estimates, the population was estimated at between 11,000 and 15,000
animals. Once distributed throughout New Zealand, from the tip of the
North Island to Campbell Island, deep in the subantarctic, the species was
taken to the brink of extinction by commercial sealers of the early
nineteenth century. The major concern in recent times has been the impact
of accidental catches in the trawl fishery for squid around the Auckland
Islands, which is one of New Zealand's most important deepwater fisheries.
For each of the past four years Ministers of Conservation and Fisheries
have set a catch limit for sea lions. The squid fishery was closed early
last year, because the sea lion catch limit was exceeded.
Over the past ten years, the Department of Conservation (DOC) has been
monitoring the main breeding colonies of Dundas and Enderby Island, part of
the Auckland Islands group located some 420km south of New Zealand's South
Island. These two colonies (which collectively occupy an area roughly the
size of six football pitches) account for some 95% of the sea lion breeding
population. Annual pup production in recent years has been approximately
2,500 animals. Dundas Island is responsible for 80% of all pup production,
but is surrounded by rocky reefs and is much harder to access than Enderby,
where DOC has a research station.
DOC scientists arrived at Enderby Island in mid-January, and everything
seemed to be normal. However, when weather conditions permitted a visit to
Dundas on 26 January, the team discovered some 700 recently-dead pups.
Symptoms included puffy eyes, ulcerated anuses and vaginas and lesions on
the head. Dying pups often showed spasms and paralysis. Fewer adults than
usual were on the beach, but at that time there were no signs that the
older animals had been affected. Returning to Enderby, the team soon found
that pups were beginning to die there also. In addition, adult females
started showing signs of paralysis. Afflicted animals also had small raised
lesions on the belly and neck. Post-mortems have shown pus-filled swellings
around the salivary gland in the neck. The most recent estimate on the day
of this posting is that 137 pups have died on Enderby, and a further 40 are
unaccounted for. This brings the overall pup mortality to 41 percent. 20%
of the adult females on the breeding beach are dead or afflicted with
lesions or paralysis. The numbers of adult females on the beach are
considerably lower than normal. An unknown number of females (and males)
may have died at sea, and some pups are consequently starving to death.
Samples from autopsied pups and females and six pup carcasses were flown
back to the mainland by helicopter on 29 January. Pathologists from Massey
University Cetacean Investigation Centre in Palmerston North will begin
detailed examinations of the samples on Monday 1 February.
Any helpful advice or assistance will be warmly welcomed.
