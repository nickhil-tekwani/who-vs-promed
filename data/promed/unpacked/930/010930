On 4 Jul 2020, 3 suspected cases (including one death) of bubonic plague were reported to the Ituri Provincial Health Division by the Kumudhu Health Centre head nurse (Aru Health District), Ituri Province, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). These cases are reported from a region geographically disjunct from the ongoing epidemic in the health zone of Rethy (Plague - Congo DR (05): (IT) bubonic, septicemic, fatal 20200626.7513771).

On 5 Jul 2020, a team composed of the chief doctor and the head nurse supervisor of the Aru health zone, the chief physician and the laboratory technician from Aru General Hospital and the head nurses of Kumudu and Odranyi health centres investigated the site of the outbreak. They noted the presence of 2 suspected, active cases of bubonic plague originating from the Odranyi health area.

The reported patient (F, 60 years old) was admitted to the Kumudhu health centre but comes from Trangala village located in the Odranyi health area (N2° 47' 04.8" E30° 37' 05.0"), and presented with fever (39C/102.2F), intense headache, diarrhoea, and an inguinal bubo. A rapid diagnostic test performed on this patient's bubo aspirate was positive for plague. A 2nd case (M, 2 years old) was admitted to the Odranyi health centre on 5 Jul 2020 with fever and vomiting. He also was coming from the village of Trangala in a household that had experienced the death of a 1st patient (index case) who died of suspected bubonic plague on 3 Jul 2020. Upon arrival, the investigation team was notified of the death of a 1st 10-year-old child with high fever, repeated vomiting, and an inguinal lymph node in that household. The child had been treated with an indigenous treatment before succumbing to the disease. In addition, an epizootic of rats called "edro" in the local language (Lugbara) was reported in the immediate vicinity of this household around 1 Jul 2020.

A total of 18 contacts -- including those who attended the funeral wake of the deceased 10 year old boy -- were traced, doxycycline (100mg) was administered as a preventive measure, and 6 households were disinfected with deltamethrin.

News from a WeChat notice from China's embassy in Congo on 6 Jul 2020. On 3 Jul 2020, the Ituri Provincial Government announced that bubonic plague has occurred in the province's Djugu region. 36 cases have been confirmed with 8 deaths. According to a report from the World Health Organization, Ituri Province is the world's most active region for plague with about 1000 cases per year. Bubonic plague can be spread by infected fleas. Clinical manifestations are swelling of lymph nodes, fever, chills, headache, exhaustion, muscle aches, etc. The main treatment method is by antibiotics.

China's embassy to the DRC cautions Chinese citizens not to visit the outbreak region and take thorough personal precautions to avoid contact with rodents. If symptoms such as fever, chills, hemoptysis, or swelling of lymph nodes occur, seek medical attention right away.

[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. A quarantine would be required with contact tracing and even prophylactic antimicrobials if the index case or cases actually had plague pneumonia. - Mod.LL
