In a follow-up on the meningococcal disease outbreak in Florida in early 2022, Florida state health officials reported an additional case in Polk County this week -- the 2nd in the county and the 22nd confirmed case reported this year to date [15 Apr 2022] statewide.

The 22 cases from 1 Jan to 14 Apr 2022 is up dramatically from the 5 confirmed cases reported during the same period in 2021; 27 confirmed cases were reported in all of 2021.

The cases by county year to date are as follows: Brevard (2), Hardee (1), Hillsborough (1), Lake (3), Leon (3), Miami-Dade (2), Orange (6), Osceola (1), Polk (2), and Seminole (1).

Last week, the Florida Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on the outbreak of meningococcal disease primarily among gay, bisexual, and men who have sex with men, including those living with HIV. CDC is encouraging gay, bisexual, and men who have sex with men to
- get a MenACWY vaccine if they live in Florida, and
- talk with their healthcare provider about getting a MenACWY vaccine if they are traveling to Florida.

In addition, CDC is highlighting the following existing meningococcal vaccine recommendations:
- MenACWY vaccination is routinely recommended for all people with HIV in the United States
- Young adults in the United States, including college students, may choose to get a MenB vaccine

The Florida Department of Health (FDOH) is responding to an outbreak of meningococcal disease in Florida. However, it can be prevented and treated. Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect against meningococcal disease.

Thus far, the number of cases identified in 2022 surpasses the 5-year average of meningococcal disease cases in Florida. FDOH epidemiologists are investigating each case as well as contacting people with potential or direct exposure to known cases to provide them with information and treatment options.

The following groups should consider vaccination with a meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) vaccine during this outbreak:
- college and university students;
- immunocompromised individuals;
- people living with HIV;
- men who have sex with men;
- people in any groups listed above who received their MenACWY vaccine more than 5 years ago.

The Florida Department of Health in Leon County (DOH Leon) is investigating 3 confirmed cases of meningococcal disease in individuals in Tallahassee aged 18 to 22. This is a serious disease caused by a bacteria called _Neisseria meningitidis_. However, it is preventable and treatable. Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect against meningococcal disease.

"We are working to investigate these cases and to ensure that people who have come into close contact with the patients receive antibiotics as a precautionary measure against infection," said Sandon S. Speedling, MHS, CPM, CPH, interim health officer, DOH Leon.

[Outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by a _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C strain with a certain genotype (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/rapid-risk-assessment-invasive-meningococcal-disease-among-MSM.pdf) have occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Germany, Belgium, and France. Similar outbreaks among MSM caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C have occurred in Canada and the US (see prior ProMED posts in see alsos below).

Molecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of IMD are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/). However, less virulent strains have been reported to cause IMD in immunocompromised HIV-infected patients (http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-86702011000200017). Severely immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection and a low CD4 cell count of less than or equal to 200/mm3 are likely to be at greater risk of developing bacterial meningitis (http://www.researchgate.net/publication/26279285).

Mass vaccination campaigns have been used to control outbreaks of IMD in MSM (see alsos below). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has released recommendations for the use of meningococcal vaccines to control outbreaks of serogroup C meningococcal disease (CDC. Control and prevention of serogroup C meningococcal disease: evaluation and management of suspected outbreaks: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR Recomm Rep. 1997; 46(RR-5): 13-21; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm). We are not told the meningococcal serogroup(s) involved in the current Florida outbreak among MSM in the reports above. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

ProMED posted 2 reports recently (see alsos below) of 3 cases of confirmed cases of meningococcal disease in individuals, 18 to 22 years old, in Tallahassee, Florida; at least one of the 3 cases in this cluster is a university student, but we were not told if they were infected by the same meningococcal serogroup, how the other 2 cases are linked to the one university student, or the timeline over which the cases occurred. For example, were they friends, attended the same social events, shared accommodations, etc.? Tallahassee is home to 2 of Florida's major public universities, Florida State University and Florida A&M University, as well as Tallahassee Community College, with a combined enrolment of more than 70 000 students annually. According to the US CDC, "there is no evidence at this time to suggest that the cases among college students are related to a larger outbreak" in Florida among men who have sex with men (MSM) (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/outbreaks/FL2022.html). More information on the Tallahassee outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
