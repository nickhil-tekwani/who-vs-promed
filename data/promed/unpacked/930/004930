In the posting regarding salmonellosis related to meat rolls in New
South Wales and Tasmania [see 1st ProMED ref. below], the 2 outbreaks
are [posted] together. While the outbreaks appear similar they are
not linked, as they have occurred in different states and the
ingredients have come from different places.
The outbreak in northwest Tasmania is due to _Salmonella_ serotype
Typhimurium phage type 135 and is associated with bread rolls
containing chicken, salad, and egg that were prepared at a bakery.
There are also some community cases without links to the bakery that
are being investigated. There are approximately 16 cases in total.
The outbreak in Sydney is associated with "Vietnamese style" pork and
chicken rolls that were prepared in a Vietnamese bakery. This
outbreak is due to _Salmonella_ serotype Typhimurium and the phage
type is pending. There are approximately 200 cases associated with
this outbreak.
The "Vietnamese style" rolls are a high-risk food vehicle, as they
contain ingredients, such as mayonnaise containing raw eggs, chicken
liver pate, and pork or chicken. Australia has previously experienced
several very large outbreaks of salmonellosis associated with these
"Vietnamese style" pork and chicken rolls (see:
<http://www.health.gov.au/internet/wcms/Publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi2903m.htm>)
This current outbreak in New South Wales is the largest point source
outbreak of foodborne salmonellosis in this State for at least 5
years. Food safety regulators in Australia have worked with the
Vietnamese community to improve the safety of these products, but
this outbreak highlights the need for vigilance in this area.
"Vietnamese style" rolls are prepared in bakeries, but they are very
different than the more European style bakery associated with the
outbreak in Tasmania. Outbreaks in bakeries are also very common in
Australia, which have often been suspected to be due to contamination
from eggs. It is important to note that Australia does not have
_Salmonella_ serotype Enteritidis endemic in egg laying flocks.
Egg-associated outbreaks in Australia are usually due to the use of
cracked or dirty eggs, and are predominantly caused by _Salmonella_
Typhimurium, which has a significantly lower potential for
intraovarian infection of chickens than _Salmonella_ serotype Enteritidis.

[ProMED-mail thanks the authors for this pertinent information about
these outbreaks. As stated in the initial moderator comments, it was
not at all clear that the outbreaks were linked. Both appear to be
related to serotype Typhimurium. The phage type of the cluster in NSW
is not yet known. - Mod.LL]

An outbreak of food poisoning linked to a bread shop in Sydney's west
has now affected 247 people, health authorities say. Sydney South
West Area Health Service (SSWAHS) says 60 people have been
hospitalized so far and 26 of them have gastroenteritis caused by
salmonellosis.
The SSWAHS is investigating the French Golden hot bread shop at
Homebush West, where all of the affected people ate either pork or
chicken rolls last weekend.
The New South Wales Food Authority has sent inspectors to the bread
shop to examine food safety practices and to sample foods for laboratory tests.
The shop stopped selling the rolls on Tue 27 Mar 2007, and is
prohibited from producing or selling the implicated foods. It remains
closed until further notice. Authorities warn anyone who may have
eaten the rolls from the bread shop between Fri 23 Mar and Tue 27 Mar
2007, to be vigilant for the symptoms of salmonella infection and
seek medical care.

A growing salmonella outbreak in northwest Tasmania is likely to have
been caused by eggs, health officials say. Tasmania's Director of
Public Health, Dr Roscoe Taylor, said at least 16 people have
reported food poisoning in the past 2 weeks.
Somerset bakery VJ's closed voluntarily on Mon 26 Mar 2007 after
being linked to 11 of the cases. But Dr Taylor said a very limited
number of small egg producers have introduced cracked and dirty eggs
into the market, which have a higher risk of carrying salmonellosis.
He said the eggs were mixed and sold under a variety of different
brand names at retail outlets throughout the northwest.
Dr Taylor said the egg producers implicated have been required to
immediately withdraw the eggs from sale. "Consumers across Tasmania
who have purchased eggs are urged to check their quality and where
there is any evidence that they are cracked, dirty, bloody, or come
in re-used cartons, to either dispose of or return the eggs
immediately to the point of sale," he said.
He said it was impossible to identify the source and link the
supplier because several small producers combined eggs from different
farms. Health [authorities] are working with the Department of
Primary Industry and Water to see what longer-term measures can be
put in place to help consumers steer clear of eggs that are cracked
or dirty. Dr Taylor says the major supermarket chains do not sell the
affected eggs.
