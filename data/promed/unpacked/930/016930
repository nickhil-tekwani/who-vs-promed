Hepatitis C cases soar in East Lancashire
-----------------------------------------
The number of people living with hepatitis C has soared in East
Lancashire. New figures show that 1023 people in Blackburn and Darwen
were estimated to have the blood-borne virus last year [2010], up from
693 in 2009. Overall cases in the rest of Lancashire are thought to
have risen from 3265 to 5711.

Hepatitis C is [a virus] infection of the liver, which can cause liver
problems, cancer and even death if untreated. Treating people infected
with the disease is costing Blackburn with Darwen GBP 831 000 [USD 1
312 089] and Lancashire GBP 4 638 000 [USD 7 322 996] per year,
according to the Health Protection Agency (HPA) North West. It said at
least 22 500 people in the region were living with chronic hepatitis C
disease and the annual cost of treating them was GBP 32 million [USD
50 525 201].

But the HPA's annual hepatitis C report for 2011 said that this figure
was likely to be an underestimation of the true burden of disease as
the "pre-valence of hepatitis C in the North West was high compared to
other regions."

Dr Evdokia Dardamissis, consultant in health protection, said:
"Hepatitis C remains a major public health problem. "We are working
closely with our partners to improve surveillance and research and to
increase public awareness, particularly amongst injecting drug users
because they are at greatest risk in this region. If we can raise
public awareness, the people who are most at risk can take measures to
prevent themselves from becoming infected and those who are already
infected can be brought into highly effective treatment programmes."
The majority of cases were caused by injecting drug users -- the most
common risk factor."

Valley and Rossendale. A map of the county of Lancashire in the north

East Lancashire is an industrial area of the county with a degree of
social deprivation and unemployment with its attendant health problems
such drug abuse. The dramatic rise in case numbers over the past 2
years in East Lancashire, and Lancashire in general, is certainly
alarming. Although some forms of hepatitis C virus infection are
becoming treatable, the cost may not be sustainable without more
effective educational and social initiatives. - Mod.CP]
