Anthrax kills 2 in Upper East Region
------------------------------------
The refusal of some owners of livestock, at Tindongo in the
Talensi-Nabdam District of the Upper East Region, to vaccinate their
animals against anthrax, has led to the death of 2 persons, 11
animals, and left 7 other persons sick.

Disclosing this to The Chronicle in Bolgatanga yesterday [24 Jun
2009], after his return from Tindongo, the regional veterinary
officer, Dr Thomas Anyorikeya, lamented that no deaths would have
been recorded in the area, if owners of the affected animals had
vaccinated them when his office carried out a vaccination exercise in
that area in March this year [2009]. He explained that anthrax was
caused by anthrax bacteria [_Bacillus anthracis_]. It was soil-borne,
and when animals grazed, especially during the dry season, or when
the grasses were too low, they picked up some of the spores from the
soil. The germs then multiply in the animal leading to its death. Dr
Anyorikeya continued that when people consume the meat of the dead
animals, they also contract the disease. The victims are then hit
with boils on various parts of the body. [From handling the
contaminated carcass and meat. Gastro-enteric cases follow from
consuming said meat. - Mod.MHJ]

According to him, between [4-20 Mar 2009], staff of his office
embarked on a vaccination exercise in the Tindongo and Shaiga areas,
which have records of the disease. However, some of the owners of
livestock did not vaccinate their animals -- mainly goats and sheep.

The officer said on [22 Jun 2009], the news about the death of the 2
persons reached community health volunteers in the area, who alerted
his office. He immediately deployed his staff to the affected
community, and all the remaining smoked meat were seized and buried,
while animal pens and the sites, where the dead animals were
prepared, were also disinfected.

Dr Anyorikeya said the incident took place in a large household,
where 9 people fell sick after consuming the dead animals, leading to
the death of the 2 persons, 10 goats, and one sheep.

He disclosed that his officers could vaccinate 1200 animals,
including goats, sheep, pigs, donkeys, and cattle. He said if people
desisted from opening up dead animals, and presented their animals
for vaccination, the veterinary team would be able to control the disease.

At the time of filing this report, Dr Anyorikeya had returned from
the affected community, where a number of animals were vaccinated. He
insisted that people should present their animals for vaccination
against anthrax, since it was only Gp20 [approximately USD 13 cents]

The regional secretary of the Ghana Red Cross Society, Mr Joseph
Abarike, said the society would use its volunteers and women's groups
to carry out intensive education on the dangers associated with anthrax.

[Ghana has one of the best veterinary services in Africa, much less
West Africa. Dr Anyorikeya has been struggling for some time to get
his farmers to present their livestock for vaccination. We wish him
well. Otherwise the incidence of this disease has been falling
significantly in Ghana for some years. Anthrax is most common in the
Northern Region, Upper East, and Eastern regions and is seen in parts
of the Volta and Central Regions.

Anthrax is a livestock problem in neighbouring Burkina Faso and Togo.
But in the former country it occurs in the northern and central
provinces away from the Ghanian NE borders. In Togo it is in Kara and
Savannes provinces, which do abut Ghana. Frankly this is a major
problem throughout Western Africa and Ghana is to be congratulated
for their ability to control it as well as they do and their ongoing
enthusiasm.
