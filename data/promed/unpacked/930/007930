Nepal
- National. 11 Nov 2017. Massive Dengue Outbreak (Sarlahi, Mahottari, Dhading, Jhapa, Rupandehi, Kathmandu districts). As of Sep. 2017, nearly 500 hundred patients infected with dengue virus have visited Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH). The majority of these patients were from different parts of the country particularly Sarlahi, Mahottari, Dhading, and Rupandehi districts. Very recently, at least 5 residents of Kathmandu were found to have contracted dengue virus, and they had no recent history of travel outside Kathmandu valley. However, so far, no information is available on the serotype/s of the dengue virus/es that is/are currently circulating in Nepal. This is the largest ever-recorded number of dengue-infected patients at STIDH. It shows that the government of Nepal is not well prepared for dengue outbreaks, though such dengue outbreaks have been observed, since 2006 [1,2]. Public health education (in local language) and local community involvement is critical to reduce dengue transmission, especially where mosquito density is highest or being spread elsewhere in Nepal.

- National . 21 Nov 2017. Dengue is spreading fast in Nepal, in what could be the worst and most explosive epidemic since 2010. A few days ago, a patient diagnosed with dengue virus was airlifted to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) for treatment. Another patient was brought to Kathmandu after she was confirmed to have contracted dengue virus. These 2 representative cases reflect panic among patients who are currently experiencing dengue-like symptoms, especially in the worst dengue-affected areas.

India
- Multiple States. 2 Nov 2017 India's southern states have this year [2017] witnessed dramatic 2- to 7-fold surges in the number of documented dengue patients over last year [2016] that medical experts say are the likely result of sharp increases in mosquito populations. The Union health ministry's unit that tracks mosquito-borne diseases has recorded the largest increases in dengue patients and associated deaths this year [2017] in Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. The numbers have fallen from last year [2016] in several parts of eastern India, including Bengal and Bihar, amid allegations of suppression of data in some states. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme documented over 16 000 dengue patients in Tamil Nadu till October 29 [2017], a 6.3-fold rise over 2016. Fifty-two patients have died of dengue - a viral infection spread by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito - in the state this year [2017] compared to 5 last year [2016]. The 2017 dengue burden has increased 2.4 to 7.6 times in 3 other southern states.

Of the total cases reported, 4428 (66 percent) were probable, with a positive result for dengue by rapid diagnostic test (RDT), of 241 samples referred for PCR testing at the Viral Haemorrhagic fever (VHF) reference lab of the Centre Muraz, Bobo-Dioulasso, 141 (59 percent) were confirmed cases by positive result. Further characterization of 72 samples has identified 3 dengue virus serotypes: DENV-2 (N=58), DENV-3 (N=12) and DENV-1 (N=2). Cases are currently reported in 12 of the country's 13 health regions, with 64 percent of cases reported in the central region, particularly in the city of Ouagadougou. http://www.who.int/csr/don/6-november-2017-dengue-burkina-faso/en/
- National-21 Nov 2017. Global health officials say the dengue fever outbreak in the African nation of Burkina Faso continues to spread particularly in the central region of the country, which contains the capital city of Ouagadougou. Since our last report, the number of cases have essentially doubled in the country (6699 suspected, probable or confirmed cases and 13 deaths on Oct. 27 versus 12087 cases and 24 deaths through Nov. 11).Despite the high numbers, officials say the number of cases in the Central region and a dozen other regions is decreasing slightly.
Characterization of samples has identified 3 dengue virus serotypes: DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-1, with DEN-2 predominating (74 percent). http://outbreaknewstoday.com/africa-dengue-declining-slightly-burkina-faso-94104/
- National .30 Nov 2017. WHO update on Dengue outbreak in Bukina Faso as of Nov 03 there have been 9029 suspected, probable, confirmed cases and 18 deaths http://www.who.int/csr/don/6-november-2017-dengue-burkina-faso/en/

Austria Ex Egypt. 21 Nov 2017. We report a case of confirmed dengue fever in Austria acquired in Hurghada/Egypt. A 54-year-old Austrian returned from a 16-day-vacation in Hurghada to Vienna on October 29, 2017. On the 4th day after his return he complained about general weakness, abdominal pain and slight diarrhea. On November 9th he visited a surgical outpatient department, where a complete medical check-up yielded laboratory signs of a viral infection (thrombopenia 60G/l, leukopenia 3.6 G/l, elevated liver enzymes). He denied having a fever; however, we discovered an erythema on his back. Although diagnosis of dengue fever in tourists returning from Egypt is very unusual, we performed virological tests: NS1-antigen test and dengue hemagglutination inhibition test (HHT) have been carried out, both proved (highly) positive. (Dr. Eva-Maria Geringer, Department of Virology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria) On following visits all his complaints had disappeared and laboratory parameters returned to normal range. Our patient spent his holiday in a beach resort in Hurghada, he denies having been on any tours or trips outside of his resort. His flight route was without any stopover. From our point of view this has a potential impact on travel medicine advice: repellents should be recommended for travels to Hurghada and all febrile illnesses returning from Egypt should be evaluated for dengue fever.

[3] Vaccine Trials
Date: Sat 25 Nov 2017 01 14 AM IST

http://www.livemint.com/Science/UZbdemKon8fpa3q4sRtHPO/Dengue-vaccine-likely-by-2019end-says-Panacea-Biotec.html


India could have a vaccine for the dreaded dengue as early as end 2019, according to drug maker Panacea Biotec, which has secured permission to conduct clinical trials for the vaccine in India. Panacea Biotec will start clinical trials on humans by early 2018, a spokesperson said, adding that it has received permission to conduct phase I/II trials from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI).

The vaccine for the mosquito-borne disease, which has killed at least 216 people in India so far this year [2017], is critical to drive down the number of deaths caused by the disease and lower out-of-pocket costs of patients. Panacea Biotec, in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), US, has developed the advanced dengue vaccine with proven safety in pre-clinical studies. Currently, some of the vaccines under development require 2-3 doses to achieve the desired immune response, while the published clinical data of the only licensed vaccine outside India has shown poor immune response against the Type-2 strain of dengue, besides being a 3-dose vaccine which is effective only in the age group of 9-45 years. Panacea Biotec's vaccine is a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine.

According to the health ministry, a total of 140 910 cases and 216 deaths due to dengue have been reported in India this year [2017], according to data available till [Sun 19 Nov 2017]. The maximum number of cases was reported from Tamil Nadu (20 141), followed by Kerala (19 543), Karnataka (15 570), Punjab (14 049), West Bengal (10 697) and Delhi (8,549). In 2016, the total number of dengue cases across India was 129 166 and in 2015 the recorded number was 99 913. A total of 245 people died of dengue in 2016 and 220 the previous year [2015].

Currently, there are no specific therapeutic options available and the treatment of dengue is primarily supportive. Prevention is currently limited to vector control measures only.
