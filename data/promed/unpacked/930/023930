Regarding the question of "subclinical" rabies in exposed individuals,
there is a reference (which I do not have access to) I have seen cited as
possible evidence of human such a case. The citation is Follmann EG,
Ritter DG and M. Beller, "Survey of Fox Trappers in Northern Alaska for
Rabies Antibody", Epidemiol. Infect. 113(1):137-141, published in 1994.
The authors found a single male trapper with no history of rabies
immunization with an anti rabies titer of 2.3 IU/mL. I would be interested
to know the methodology used to measure the titer, whether they had a
second lab reproduce the result, and also wonder how certain they are that
the trapper had never received any prophylaxis.

[While the thread had been cut on this, Stephen has reminded us of a useful
paper out of Alaska. In this paper 26 trappers in northern Alaska were bled
and tested for rabies antibodies using the rapid fluorescent focus
inhibition test at Kansas State University; all results were rerun at a
second laboratory in Georgia. Three demonstrated raised titres but 2/3 had
been vaccinated at one time. The unvaccinated individual had a titre of
2.30 I.U./ml; this person was 68 yo who had been trapping for 47 years, had
skinned over 3,000 foxes, never wore gloves while skinning, and had no
memory of ever being bitten by a fox. His medical records in (USPHS Native
hospital and health clinic) Barrow and (Alaska Native Medical Center)
Anchorage showed no records of any rabies vaccination. The two others with
titres of 1.80 and 2.30 I.U./ml had received post-exposure vaccinations,
with duck embryo and human diploid cell vaccines respectively. The paper
indicates
that, according to the literature, rabies is now rare in Arctic trappers.
Therefore by rank, gross, speculative extrapolation, at best, some 4% of
professional bat handlers might display rabies antibodies. The reality will
be different. This thread is cut. - Mod.MHJ
