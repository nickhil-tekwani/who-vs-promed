Health authorities from New Hampshire have reported the 1st case of the seasonal Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) [this year (2020)]. The rare viral infection is the 10th case in the state since 2013, amounting to about 50 cases in the Midwest and Northeast in the past 10 years.

The patient was an adult individual from Loudon, who is currently recovering at home after hospitalization for neurological symptoms. Local health authorities have declared the arboviral risk level to be high during this season. "When people are out of their homes, they should continue to take steps to not only protect themselves and others from COVID-19, but also to protect themselves from mosquito and tick bites," said Dr. Benjamin Chan, the State Epidemiologist.

The mosquito virus was 1st identified from mosquitos in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado, in 1961. It is closely related to the La Crosse encephalitis virus. Similar to other diseases [pathogens] from mosquitoes, symptoms are flu-like with fever, fatigue, dizziness, and muscle aches. [Jamestown Canyon virus infections may progress to encephalitis as occurred in the above case. CDC reports that some people also have respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, or runny nose. Encephalitis or meningitis include stiff neck, confusion, loss of coordination, difficulty speaking, or seizures. About half of patients reported with Jamestown Canyon virus disease are hospitalized (https://www.cdc.gov/jamestown-canyon/symptoms/index.html). - Mod.TY]

Nearby in Connecticut, the state began trapping and testing mosquitos for various viruses in June [2020], coordinated by the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES). CAES scientists Philip Armstrong said, "We detect Jamestown Canyon virus every year in mosquitoes, and there is no indication that it is becoming more prevalent based on the mosquito surveillance data."

Dr. Chan said, "In addition to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there are other infectious disease threats to New Hampshire residents, including from mosquito and tick bites. Jamestown Canyon virus is one of the infections that are able to be transmitted by mosquito bites in New Hampshire."

[Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) cases are not new in New Hampshire. They were diagnosed in New Hampshire last year (2019) and in 2013, 2015, and 2017. JCV infections are extremely rare and, if laboratory confirmed, the 2018 case was the 1st documented death due to the virus (see Jamestown Canyon virus - USA: (NH) fatal, susp 20180629.5882078).

As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, JCV was first isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado, in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in the eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal [northern] _Aedes_ and _Ochlerotatus_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit it. White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_, are the principal amplification hosts.

As Drs Charles Calisher and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED-mail archive no. 20040807.2171, JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an etiological agent of human disease. The previous report provided related references. - Mod.TY
