There are several aspects of _Culex pipiens_ biology that should be
considered at
this juncture in time and in the future.
1. Based upon previous studies on this mosquito [Eldridge 1968. Am. J.
Trop. Med. Hyg. 17: 133; Spielman & Wong 1973 J. Med Entomol. 10: 319;
Spielman & Wong 1973, Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am. 66: 905, most newly emerging
females should be or will soon be entering reproductive diapause at this
time based on photoperiod conditions. This should bring the epidemic to a
natural end, at least for this winter. I would expect, however, a
considerable time lag until all the cases are recognized.
2. During warm "Indian summer" conditions, females destined for diapause
reportedly exhibit gonotrophic dissociation; i.e., take small blood meals,
but do not develop eggs. These females can become infected with SLE and
potentially serve as an overwintering mechanism for this virus [see
reference below.
3. If there is a large population present, I would expect successful
overwintering in both above and below ground structures that remain cold. I
think that a mosquito/SLE surveillance program should be established this
winter and careful monitoring of infection in components of the enzootic
cycle next summer [should be done. This could prevent the need for
emergency adult control that seems to be currently on-going.

[In a previous comment I indicated that it was Joel Dalrymple et al. who
has isolated SLE virus from overwintering adult mosquitoes in Maryland.
Doug Watts let us know that it was Charlie Bailey who was the senior author
on that seminal paper; Doug Watts was a co-author. Here is the reference:
Bailey CL, Eldridge BF, Hayes DE, Watts DM, Tammariello RF, and Dalrymple
JM. (1978) Isolation of St. Louis encephalitis virus from overwintering
_Culex pipiens_ mosquitoes. Science. 199:1346-1349. Doug also was involved
in the original research showing that La Crosse bunyavirus was
transovarially transmitted, so he ought to know. I am grateful for the
correction. Led me to reread some neat stuff. - Mod.CHC

In response to the comments by Lucas Terracina, the epidemic of SLE in
Corpus Christi, Texas in the summer of 1966 traced the distribution of
cases to the combined effects of an unusual distribution of vector mosquito
breeding sites in storm sewers in the upper socioeconomic districts and a
higher degree of residual immunity in the residents of the lower
socioeconomic areas. This is important to recognize since treatment of
open sources is relatively easy, but leaves these other possible sites as
potential sources of infected mosquitoes. In that outbreak, the infection
rate in mosquitoes was 1:151 before aerial spraying. After spraying, the
mosquito counts in the established resting sites were reduced to 5-10% of
their previous levels for about 5 days. No additional isolations of SLE
virus were made from more than 4600 _Culex quinquefasciatus_ collected over
the next 2 months. In addition, once it was established that large numbers
of mosquitoes were present deep within the drains, an insecticidal fog
machine was used to force a fog of 5% malathion and diesel fuel for great
distances within the drains, traveling as much as 0.8 km in one occasion.
Methodology is described in the paper [referenced below. Human cases are
the last in the chain of events and the peak number of confirmed cases may
not occur for 4-6 weeks.

[I believe Bill and Blaine are indicating the epidemic peak in NY City may
not occur for some weeks yet. I agree and others with whom I have spoken
agree that this is the likely scenario. - Mod.CHC

Earlier today I spoke with Dr. William C. Reeves, now retired from the
University of California at Berkeley, but, as far as I and many others are
concerned, still the expert in SLE virus epidemiology. In response to my
question as to when the last outbreak of SLE occurred in New York, he
didn't recall there having been any. That probably means there haven't
been any. In response to my question regarding whether the recent weather
conditions in New York were usual or unusual for SLE epidemics, he pointed
out that 1933, the year SLE virus was recognized from an epidemic in St.
Louis , Missouri, had been the driest on record in that city.
Conversations with others, not exactly off the record but not attributable
to them, led me to believe that (a) Based on inapparent:apparent ratios
documented in previous outbreaks and epidemics, there may very well have
been many more cases of SLE virus infection (not necessarily St. Louis
encephalitis, although some of these may also have been unrecognized),
including mild cases and asymptomatic infections, in NY City. (b) The zero
based budgeting used by NY City might discourage investing in studies of or
surveillance for a disease that has not occurred in the area, (c) Bob
Novak's and Paul Grimstad's comments about catch basins and sewers as a
source of adult mosquitoes could be right on with respect to NY City. As
best I can tell, the infrastructure below the streets of New York is
antiquated and basically uncharted. The Department of Health would have to
consult with various other city departments, various utilities (gas,
electric, telephone), the subway folks), etc.; a nightmare. (d) Nearby
Nassau County cut its vector control budget and, as had NY City, been
involved mainly with pest control. Some folks might not know a pest
mosquito from a potential vector. (e) The current thinking is that
extensive aerial and ground applications of malathion will do the job for
now. Obviously, it is too late to consider source reduction or larviciding
on a large scale, so the short-term goal is to reduce the adult mosquito
population. It is these mosquitoes that are carrying the virus and by
reducing these populations around NY City (as, we trust, is being done
elsewhere in the area) at least interrupt the mosquito-bird virus
amplification cycle and thereby prevent further human infections/illnesses.
Good weather will be needed to conduct successful spraying operations.
Finally, I have a question for our readers: What is the likelihood that a
single bird or a few birds, infected with SLE virus (from where?) decided
to nest only in Queens County and that this is not a problem of the entire
NY City area, which to me includes Connecticut, Westchester County (NY),
and New Jersey? If the cases occurring this year are the only ones that
occur, then the entire metropolitan NY area has dodged a bullet. As Bill
Reisen has said, indications are that additional studies will be required
next year -- but this one is not yet over.
