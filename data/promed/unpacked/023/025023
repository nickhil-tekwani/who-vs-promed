LEAF RUST, BARLEY - ARGENTINA: (BUENOS AIRES) NEW STRAIN

Near Necochea (Buenos Aires province), barley has become a major crop.
A single variety is grown largely for export which facilitates the
emergence and spread of fungal strains overcoming host resistance.
During routine monitoring programmes, an explosive increase in barley
leaf rust was noted in 2010 in the southeast of the province.
Fungicides are being used to combat the outbreak.

[Barley leaf rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia hordei_. Serious
yield losses may be caused by cereal rusts. Rust spores are mainly
spread by wind and with infected straw, and some grasses or volunteer
cereals may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum for the next
cropping season. Disease management may include cultural practices to
reduce inoculum (such as control of volunteer cereals), timely
fungicide applications, use of clean seed, and host resistance if
available. Crop monitoring for early discovery of infection at any
stage of the crop cycle is important so action can be taken to limit
the spread of the pathogens as well as build-up of inoculum.

New even more virulent strains of cereal rusts are emerging worldwide,
including strains with new fungicide resistances or, like the
situation reported above for Argentina, strains that have overcome
host resistance genes present in local cereal varieties. Ongoing
breeding programmes attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution and
adaptation by continuously developing new cereal varieties.
