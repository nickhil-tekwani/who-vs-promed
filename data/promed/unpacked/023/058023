According to an Ecuadorian newspaper, the health department in Chimborazo
Province (located in the Andean mountains) advised local medical personnel
that patients admitted from the town of Guamote presenting fever, cough,
enlargement of the lymph nodes, weakness and malaise, should be considered
as suspected cases of bubonic plague. This decision was taken after
confirming 3 fatal cases due to the disease in the last 2 months.

The death of several guinea pigs (cuyes) has been reported in the
community of San Pedro de Yaucupamba, where 2 human fatalities have already
occurred. Unfortunately, the information was suppressed, said Dr. Adela
Vimos, Director of Epidemiology, Chimborazo Province. It also mentioned
that personnel from the Malaria Control Program are currently spraying in
the community of San Pedro de Yaucupamba, the urban area of Guamote and
other vicinity communities including Santa Teresita, Cochaloma and
Jatumpamba. Teachers from local schools started an educational campaign to
prevent the occurrence of new cases.

According to Vimos, the disease is endemic in the region, reason why the
new re-emergence of human cases is a dangerous threat to the community
health. The health authorities of the Province of Chimborazo have also
prohibited the consumption of guinea pigs and rabbits in the region until
the transmission of the disease is controlled. The manipulation of flesh,
consumption of poorly cooked guinea pigs, or the direct contact with the
host or the infected fleas could potentially lead to human infection -- all
reasons that the health authorities urge the elimination of guinea pigs,
rabbits, and rats, especially in the areas from where the cases were
reported.

The health authorities of Chimborazo confirmed that over the past 2 months,
in the canton of Guamote, a mother and her daughter died with symptoms
compatible with bubonic plague. A 3rd person presenting similar symptoms is
hospitalized in the isolation unit of a teaching hospital in the city of
Riobamba.

The health authorities issued a ban on the consumption of cavies or guinea
pigs (_Cavia porcellus_), and rabbits due to a reappearance of bubonic plague.

Adela Vimos, head of Epidemiology of the Health Department of Chimborazo,
reported that in the canton of Guamote, and particularly in the community
of San Pedro de Yacupamba, the disease has been present for several years,
and that over the past few months a dangerous resurgence of the disease has
been observed.

The epidemiology department is carrying out control measures that include
the fumigation of high-risk areas. Vimos placed special emphasis on the
need to abstain from the commerce and consumption of cavies and rabbits.

A 55 year old woman and her 22 year old daughter died of bubonic plague in
the locality of Guamote in the province of Chimborazo. The mother and
daughter raised guinea pigs for sale. These animals are a common food in
the Andean region. 500 persons were treated to prevent spread of the
disease. The epidemiological focus was identified and according to
authorities an epidemiological containment circle has been
established. High risk areas will be fumigated to eradicate the fleas.

Authorities indicated that plague is endemic in that area (grasslands over
2000 mts. above sea level). When it rains rats that live in those
grasslands seek refuge in inhabited areas. In this case a rat bit a guinea
pig that was then consumed by the deceased. On April 29th an alert was
issued for the provinces of Cotopaxi, Tungurahua, Bol√≠var, Azuay and
Chimborazo. No new cases have been detected.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Leon and Dr. Ottolenghi for information regarding this
cluster of plague cases in the Andean area of Ecuador where plague has
occurred in the past. - Mod.LL]

[The outbreak of pneumonic plague reported by ProMED-mail in 1998
(Pneumonic plague - Ecuador 19980501.0852) also occurred in Guamote
county/canton but in a different locality. Plague has been reported in
this general region since first reports of cases in Chimborazo in 1977.
There was a major outbreak in 1998 (approximately 160 cases) and 14 cases
reported in 1999 (<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no3_supp/ruiz.htm>) -
