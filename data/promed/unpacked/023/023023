The New York State Department of Health is again advising parents and health care providers to be aware of the signs and symptoms of enterovirus EV-D68 [infection], a serious respiratory illness, which has now been confirmed in more than a dozen children in New York State. EV-D68 is causing cases of severe respiratory illness among children and other individuals, sometimes resulting in hospitalization, especially among children with asthma. Cases have been confirmed in the Capital Region and Central New York. Specimens have been received from other regions for testing.

Enteroviruses are transmitted through close contact with an infected person, or by touching objects or surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. There is no specific treatment for EV-D68 infections other than management of symptoms and no specific anti-viral medications currently available for this purpose, which is why it is important to take steps to protect yourself and others from respiratory infections such as enterovirus.

In addition to the confirmed cases, more samples from around the state are on their way to the New York State Department of Health's (DOH) Wadsworth Laboratory for testing. Wadsworth Laboratory is the only laboratory in the state that can confirm EV-D68. While there are more than 100 types of enteroviruses that commonly cause respiratory illness, EV-D68 is a less common type.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working with health departments in several states to investigate suspected clusters of respiratory illness. DOH is sharing its testing results with CDC to assist it in monitoring the circulation of the virus nationally. DOH is working with the CDC and partnering with local health departments and health care providers to monitor the spread of severe respiratory illnesses in New York and asking health care providers to report clusters or outbreaks of severe respiratory illnesses to their local health department or to DOH.

Enteroviruses are very common viruses; there are more than 100 types. It is estimated that 10 to 15 million enterovirus infections occur in the United States each year. Enteroviruses can cause respiratory illness, febrile rash, and neurologic illnesses, such as aseptic meningitis (swelling of the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord) and encephalitis (swelling of the brain). Most infected people have no symptoms or only mild symptoms, but some infections can be serious. Infants, children, and teenagers are most likely to get infected with enteroviruses and become sick.

Most enterovirus infections in the United States occur seasonally during the summer and fall. Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) infections are thought to occur less commonly than infections with other enteroviruses.

EV-D68 was 1st identified in California in 1962. Compared with other enteroviruses, EV-D68 has been rarely reported in the United States.

[This year (2014), enterovirus EV-D68 has been associated with outbreaks of serious respiratory illness throughout the USA. Enterovirus D68 has now been confirmed in more than a dozen children in New York State. Cases have been confirmed in the Capital Region and Central New York. Specimens have been received from other regions for testing. It is likely that enterovirus D68 infection is responsible for severe respiratory disease among infants and children throughout the USA. So far, there have been no reports of enterovirus D68 virus infection elsewhere in the Americas or beyond.

From mid-August to 12 Sep 2014, a total of 97 people in Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky and Missouri have been confirmed to have respiratory illness caused by EV-D68. Among the EV-D68 cases in Missouri and Illinois, children with asthma seemed to have a higher risk for severe respiratory illness (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/EV-D68.html). - Mod.CP
