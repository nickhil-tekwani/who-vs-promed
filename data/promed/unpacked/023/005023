Bush Orders Military Smallpox Shots
---------------------------
President Bush said Friday he will take the smallpox vaccine along
with U.S. military forces, but he is not recommending the risky
inoculation for most Americans.
Vaccinations for a few dozen military personnel began Friday, and by
late January states are expected to begin inoculating health care
response teams and others who would respond to a smallpox attack. The
government will make the vaccine available to the general public
beginning in late spring or early summer, though Bush emphasized that
it is not recommended for most people. He said his family and staff
-- including Vice President Dick Cheney and the Cabinet -- would not
be vaccinated.
With war in Iraq a growing possibility, Bush said the vaccine will be
mandated for about a half-million U.S. troops in ``high-risk parts of
the world.'' Bush noted that the disease was eradicated in 1980, but
said, ``In the aftermath of September the 11th, we are evaluating old
threats in a new light.''
The shot that carries rare but serious side effects. One or 2 out of
every 1 million vaccinated will be killed by the vaccine, and 15 will
face life-threatening complications.
"As commander in chief, I do not believe I can ask others to accept
this risk unless I am willing to do the same," Bush said. "Therefore,
I will receive the vaccine along with our military."
It was unclear how troops would respond to this directive. Some in
the military balked at mandatory anthrax vaccinations, which are
considerably safer than smallpox vaccinations. About 20 000 people
working in U.S. embassies in the Middle East will also be offered the
vaccine, the State Department said.
Civilian vaccinations will begin with about 450 000 people most
likely to encounter a highly contagious smallpox patient. That
includes people who work in hospital emergency rooms and those on
special smallpox response teams. States have already identified these
people and are preparing to set up clinics. Once these programs
begin, it's expected to take about 30 days to vaccinate this group.
Next up will be emergency responders, such as police officers,
firefighters, and other health care workers. The government is
recommending the vaccine for an estimated 10 million in this group,
and health officials predicted Friday that about half would say yes.
It was unclear when these shots would begin or how long it would take
to vaccinate this group.
For months, the administration has been debating vaccinations for the
general public. Top health advisers preferred to wait until the
vaccine, just recently manufactured, is licensed by the Food and Drug
Administration before offering it to people who face no particular
threat. That's not likely until early 2004. But Bush decided that the
administration could not offer a vaccine to some without making it
available to all.
"Some individuals feel so strongly they want to be vaccinated right
now that we wanted to make it available," Health and Human Services
Secretary Tommy Thompson said. Those who want the vaccine can sign up
for clinical trials now under way. HHS will create a special program
for people who want to sign up -- expected in late spring or early
summer 2003, health officials said. Civilians could wait until 2004,
after the vaccine is licensed, although it will still not be
recommended.
Bush and his top health aides emphasized that there is enough vaccine
for all 280 million people in this country, and that plans are in
place for mass vaccinations should an attack with the virus occur.
Once among the most feared diseases on Earth, smallpox killed
hundreds of millions of people in past centuries, but it hasn't been
seen in this country since 1949. Its eradication was one of public
health's greatest victories. But because no one has been vaccinated
in decades, the population is highly vulnerable. While all stocks of
the virus beyond 2 official labs were supposed to have been
destroyed, experts fear that hostile nations or terrorist groups may
have smallpox and could use it in an attack.
An education campaign will explain the vaccine's risks in detail.
The most serious complications include encephalitis, which can cause
paralysis or permanent neurological damage, and progressive vaccinia,
where the vaccination site does not heal and the virus spreads,
eating away at flesh, bone and gut.
The vaccine poses significant risks for certain people, including
cancer patients, organ transplant recipients, people with HIV,
pregnant women, and people with a history of eczema. People who live
with others who have these conditions should not be vaccinated,
because the live virus used in the vaccine can sometimes escape the
inoculation site and infect others. Health workers delivering the
shots will have to ask questions that will screen these people out.
Federal officials are recommending that states make pregnancy and HIV
tests available to people considering the vaccination.
Health officials said they have enough vaccinia immune globulin, or
VIG, which is used to treat side effects of the vaccine, to care for
those being offered the vaccine in the coming months.

PROTECTING AMERICANS: SMALLPOX VACCINATION PROGRAM
---------------------------------
Today, the President announced a plan to better protect the American
people against the threat of smallpox attack by hostile groups or
governments:
Smallpox Response Teams
Under the plan, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
will work with state and local governments to form volunteer Smallpox
Response Teams who can provide critical services to their fellow
Americans in the event of a smallpox attack.
To ensure that Smallpox Response Teams can mobilize immediately in an
emergency, health care workers and other critical personnel will be
asked to volunteer to receive the smallpox vaccine.
The federal government is not recommending vaccination for the
general public at this time. There may be some members of the
general public who insist on being vaccinated now. Our public health
agencies will work to accommodate them, but that is not our
recommendation at this time.
Department of Defense and State Department Personnel
The President also announced that the Department of Defense (DOD)
will vaccinate certain military and civilian personnel who are or may
be deployed in high threat areas. Some United States personnel
assigned to certain overseas embassies will also be offered
vaccination.
STRENGTHENING HOMELAND SECURITY
Although there is no reason to believe that smallpox presents an
imminent threat, the attacks of September and October, 2001 have
heightened concern that terrorists may have access to the virus and
attempt to use it against the American public. Immediately after
these attacks, HHS began working, in cooperation with state and local
governments, to strengthen our preparedness for bioterror attacks by
expanding the national stockpile of smallpox vaccine. The United
States currently has sufficient quantities of the vaccine to
vaccinate every single person in the country in an emergency.
The smallpox vaccine, which was routinely administered to Americans
until 1972, is a highly effective protection against the disease when
given before or shortly after exposure to the virus. Pre-attack
vaccination of Smallpox Response Teams will allow them, in the event
of a smallpox attack, to immediately administer the vaccine to others
and care for victims.
HHS is working with states to identify health care workers and first
responders to serve on Smallpox Response Teams. Pre-attack
vaccination of these Smallpox Response Teams will allow them to
better protect the American public against smallpox attack.
The federal government is not recommending that members of the
general public be vaccinated at this point. Our government has no
information that a biological attack is imminent, and there are
significant side effects and risks associated with the vaccine. HHS
is in the process of establishing an orderly process to make
unlicensed vaccine available to those adult members of the general
public without medical contraindications who insist on being
vaccinated either in 2003, with an unlicensed vaccine, or in
2004, with a licensed vaccine. (A member of the general public may
also be eligible to volunteer for an on-going clinical trial
for next generation vaccines).
PREPARING MILITARY AND OVERSEAS PERSONNEL
The President also announced that DOD will take steps immediately to
reinstitute vaccination of certain military and civilian personnel.
Those personnel who are deployed or who may deploy to certain high
threat areas will be vaccinated. The State Department will also
offer vaccination to certain overseas personnel.
Although the vaccine is effective if administered shortly after
exposure, it may not be feasible during an emergency to vaccinate
overseas troops and civilian personnel. Pre-attack vaccination is
therefore warranted. Vaccination of military personnel was conducted
during WWI and WWII and routinely from the 1940s until 1984.
Between 1984 and 1990, vaccinations were provided to many recruits
entering basic training.

[ProMED-mail has covered the development of the current smallpox
vaccination strategies in the USA and elsewhere fairly extensively.
Since our last posting on the development of the USA smallpox
vaccination strategy on 12 Nov 2002, there has been no new technical
information available to suggest that there has been a change in the
risks of significant adverse events following receipt of the vaccine.
Rates of adverse events following receipt of smallpox vaccination
were developed based on experiences in the 50s and 60s and are cited
as rates per 1 000 000 persons vaccinated. In addition, most of the
rates cited referred to primary vaccinees (those receiving the
vaccine for the first time).
The USA is about to embark upon vaccination of approximately 1 000
000 individuals, who will consist of a mix of primary vaccinees as
well as revaccinees, many of whom received their prior immunizations
30 or more years ago. One might conjecture at this point that the
USA is about to implement a prospective study on the safety of
smallpox vaccine in 2002/2003. Hence, more recent data on the
adverse reaction rate will be available at the end of this study. -
