The recent post on whirling disease in Maryland raised question in a
moderator's mind regarding how the parasite apparently got from the
Rocky Mountain west to an eastern state. Actually, the original
detection of this agent occurred in that part of the country in the
1950s, as well as in California. The West was hit several decades
later and credit for that spread is generally given to improved
technology for movement of live trout often stocked on vacation
ranches into new ponds that drain into streams entirely managed by
natural reproduction.
In the East, Whirling Disease has mostly been a hatchery problem, but
there is chronic infection -- frequently at a level low enough to
allow wild trout reproduction -- in several famous streams in the
region. Although _Myxobolus_ spores are very tough little "hockey
pucks" that survive digestive juices of animals including birds that
eat fish, it seems unlikely that Maryland's current episode was an
importation from the West.

[Mr. Johnson clearly knows more history on Whirling disease than I. I
appreciate him sending us the historical update, which may explain
some of the apparent migration of the disease.
The site referenced by Mr. Barrett does indeed provide some great
images of this disease.
My thanks to both of you. - Mod.TG]
