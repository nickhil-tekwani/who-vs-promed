CJD-BSE CONNECTION? (11)

Compare this to beef stews, hotpots & casseroles, for which the kitchen
recipes call for chunks of meat from 3-5cm across to be cooked in an oven at
150-190 C for 2-3 hours, according to recipe. Thus time at max. temperature
would be well over the 35 mins. at 145 C in the Stord Bartz method he quotes
(the other 3 continuous methods having even lower temperatures & shorter
times at max. temperature).
Conclusion: cooking could quite possibly fix the prion - but why has no-one
reported any temperature-inactivation studies? Or have they?
