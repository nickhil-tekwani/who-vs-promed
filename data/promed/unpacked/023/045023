National Anti Malaria Programme blames Assam for malaria deaths
---------------------------------------------------
As Assam reels under a virtual malaria epidemic,
with 77 deaths already reported, the Centre has
accused the state government of a lackadaisical
approach and failure to utilize a consignment of
mosquito nets it had dispatched in 2001. A senior
official in the national anti-malaria programme
told the Statesman that 5.2 lakh mosquito nets
dispatched to Assam in 2001 were not used.
Another 4.86 lakh nets which were dispatched
earlier this month by the NAMP � after the recent
malaria outbreak in the state � too remain unused in Guwahati.
A central team reached Guwahati recently and
sealed all the godowns where the nets, supplied
in 2001 and meant for distribution, were kept. No
arrangements were made for their preservation
resulting in wasteful expenditure of Rs 43 lakh,
the report of the controller and Auditor General
of India has said. The CAG report has also pulled
up other malaria sensitive states like UP, Bihar,
Karnataka, Orissa, Rajasthan, MP and Pondicherry,
which too have ignored NAMP initiatives over the
years. � The situation would not have been so bad
in Assam had the state government acted in
advance. They failed to use mosquito nets
supplied by the Centre under the NAMP, while
people continue to die of malaria,� said the NAMP official.
However, this does not absolve the NAMP of its
responsibilities. It has been pulled up for its
failure to get rid of stocks of conventional
medicines like chloroquine which are proving
woefully inadequate for treating malaria. Even
President A P J Abdul Kalam has urged the medical
fraternity to give up use of chloroquine which
has become resistant to the _falciparum_ parasite
which causes cerebral malaria. This, he said, has
led to an increase in the number of malaria
deaths though the number of cases has come down over the years.

[The lack of appropriate control measures such as
the distribution of bed nets can explain the
present outbreak in an area with endemic,
unstable malaria transmission. It is yet unclear
if chloroquine resistance is contributing to the
increased number of fatalities. � Mod. EP]
