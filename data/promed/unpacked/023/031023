Foot (or stem) rot of sweet potato was first detected in Japan in 2018. It has now been confirmed in 27 prefectures, with as much as 75% of fields infected in some areas. The crop harvest has decreased by about 30%, and there are no signs of the infection easing. The disease has caused a chronic shortage of sweet potatoes. Its spread has been attributed to infected seed tubers and seedlings. The situation is a massive blow to sweet potato producers.

The government is urging stakeholders to install steam treatment systems to disinfect seed tubers [see comment below]; equipment costs are being subsidised. Pathogen-free seedlings are highly recommended. A national research organisation has developed a new sweet potato variety which shows high disease resistance with a flavour similar to current varieties. However, it will take at least 3 years for these measures to show any effect.

[The foot (or stem) rot disease of sweet potato (_Ipomoea batatas_) in Japan referred to above is caused by the fungus _Diaporthe destruens_ (previously _Plenodomus destruens_; see link below). Symptoms on the crop may include yellowing of seedlings, blackening of vines, stem rot, disintegration of the root system, tuber rot, wilting of shoots, and death of plants. Fungal survival in the field has been reported to be poor, so spread may mainly occurs with infected cuttings or other planting materials (as mentioned above). More research is needed on the biology of the fungus and the potential role of environmental factors in disease development. In Japan, the related fungus _D. batatas_, which causes dry rot of sweet potato, is native and widespread in fields.

_Diaporthe_ species and strains are known to be associated with stem canker diseases in a range of crops, for example soybean, sunflower, and blueberry. They can cause high yield losses and may also affect international trade due to associated biosecurity risks. The diseases are favoured by warm, humid conditions. The fungi overwinter on plant debris left in the field and can be spread with plant material, by mechanical means (wounds) and human activities, and via frost injuries. Disease management needs an integrated approach and may include phytosanitation to remove inoculum (such as deep plowing of crop residues); cultural methods (crop rotation, wide row spacing); as well as fungicide treatments of crops and/or seeds. Resistant crop cultivars are available for only some of the pathogens.

Treatment with hot steam is sometimes used to reduce fungal load within contaminated soils. However, if applied to tuber surfaces as recommended above, it will not eliminate any fungal structures within tissues. While it may reduce the amount of inoculum for stored produce, it seems unsuitable for complete elimination of the fungus, as would be needed for any kind of planting material. It is unclear why this is being suggested by official sources above.
