Foot-and-mouth disease: Paraguay and Argentina
------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease has been reported by the Paraguayan
authorities in an area (Pozo Hondo) 3 km from the border with Argentina.
Paraguay is not authorised for export of fresh meat into the EU. The
surveillance area of the outbreak affects part of the territory of
Argentina. The Argentinean authorities reacted immediately to avoid the
possible spread into Argentinean territory, in particular with vaccination
and a ban of the movement of animals along the border area.

The Commission has been informed immediately, and the Standing Committee on
the Food Chain and Animal Health voted in favour of a Commission proposal
to suspend the importation into the EU of de-boned and maturated bovine
meat from the Argentinean departments of Ramon Lista in the province of
Formosa and of Rivadavia in the Province of Salta until 15 Sep 2003.
