Second human case of West Nile virus infection in New York City
---------------------------------------------------------------
NEW YORK: New York City health commissioner, Neal L Cohen MD, announced
today that a 75 year old man in Bayside, Queens has tested positive for
West Nile virus. The patient developed symptoms on 14 Aug 2001, was
admitted to hospital on 16 Aug 2001 with fever, muscle weakness, and
confusion, and is currently recovering at the hospital. This is the second
human case of West Nile virus in New York City this year, and the first in
Queens.
Targeted, ground-based spraying will take place between 2200 Fri 24 and
0500 Sat 25 Aug 2001, weather permitting, in a 1 mile radius of the man's home.
Dr Cohen said, "The identification of another human case of West Nile virus
highlights the importance of taking personal precautions against
mosquitoes. As we are now entering the peak of the mosquito season, and as
West Nile virus has been detected in all 5 boroughs, all New Yorkers,
particularly those over 50 who may be at greater risk for severe illness,
are reminded to consider the use of a mosquito repellent containing DEET;
wear long-sleeved shirts, pants, and socks when outside during times of
high mosquito activity; and eliminate areas of standing water where
mosquitoes may breed."
Dr Cohen also announced that 5 mosquito pools found in Central Park tested
positive for West Nile virus. These findings have triggered focused,
ground-based spraying of all of Central Park that will begin early Friday
morning, 24 Aug 2001, weather permitting.
