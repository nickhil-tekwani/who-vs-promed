Two cases of highly contagious measles have been confirmed in the suburbs west of Boston, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health said Monday [24 Feb 2014], and Framingham health officials later issued a public health alert warning residents that they may have been exposed to the disease if they shopped at the Trader Joe's on Route 9 in Framingham on 15 or 16 Feb 2014.

Most people in the United States have been vaccinated against measles or were exposed as children, making them immune. But health officials are advising those who think they may have been exposed and who are experiencing symptoms of measles to avoid health care facilities because of the risk that they may potentially expose others; they are urged to call their doctor instead.

When the Framingham Board of Health became aware that there was a measles exposure at Trader Joe's last week, the head nurse jumped on it very quickly, board chairman Micheal Hugo said in a phone interview Monday [24 Feb 2014] night.

Two clinics were held at the store where free measles vaccinations were available to employees, and anyone who believed they may have been exposed, he said. "Measles is a highly contagious disease. We want to make sure we can get the immunization into people who were exposed as soon as possible," Hugo said. The chairman explained that there is a very short window when those who have been exposed can be vaccinated before the disease takes over the body. "The vaccine is extremely effective," he said.

The measles is spread more easily than almost any other disease, according to the Department of Public Health, mainly through airborne transmission such as breathing, coughing, and sneezing. The last confirmed cases of the measles in Massachusetts occurred in August 2013. The Boston Globe reported that hundreds of residents may have been exposed when an infected individual walked into a clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital seeking treatment. A few days later, another individual sought treatment for measles at MetroWest Medical Center in Framingham.

The measles were officially eliminated in the United States in 2000 because of widespread vaccination, but the disease continues to spread worldwide. An average of about 60 people in the United States contract measles every year, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mostly from people exposed in other countries who then travel here. But in 2013, 159 people contracted the measles between January and August, the CDC reported. 17 of those cases required hospitalization, but none died.

According to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, people who may be in danger of contracting the measles if exposed are:

- Infants and young children who have not received their 1st dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine at 12 to 15 months of age.

- School-age children who have not received their 2nd dose of the MMR vaccine.

- Adults who have not received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine.

Health officials recommend that even adults born before 1957, who are considered to be immune because the measles was then a widespread childhood disease in the United States, may benefit from an MMR vaccine.

International travelers, health care workers, and college students are considered a high-risk population of people who may require an additional MMR vaccination.

Remember all the frustration you expressed over the possibly non-vaccinating family of BART/UC Berkeley's Measles Patient Zero? Well, it looks like you might have been proven right, as Contra Costa County health officials are saying that 2 of the student's family members have also contracted the potentially fatal disease.

On the plus side: unlike the student, who did things like ride BART, go to classes, and hang out in Berkeley, both of the afflicted relatives chose to quarantine themselves in their homes after the student was diagnosed. As a result, it doesn't appear that anyone else was exposed to the disease by these new measles victims, described as Contra Costa County men in their 20s and 30s.

According to Contra Costa Health Services' Communicable Disease programs chief Erika Jenssen, neither the student nor (as many of you predicted) the 2 ill family members were vaccinated against the measles. Anyone who is not immunized is "very likely to get measles if they are exposed to the virus," Jenssen said. "This really underscores the importance of everyone getting vaccinated."

It's believed that the UC Berkeley student contracted measles while on a recent trip to the Philippines. On Valentine's Day, BART users were alerted to their possible exposure to the disease. Though the infected student only rode BART between El Cerrito del Norte and Downtown Berkeley stations, the airborne virus can linger on for as long as 2 hours, putting many more passengers at risk.

The illness is spread by droplets released when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Symptoms include a rash like one in the photo above, fever, cough, a runny nose, red, watery eyes, or feeling run down and achy. If you suspect that you have measles, see a doctor immediately.

The California Department of Public Health says that reported cases of measles in the Bay Area have been on the rise. For more information on the measles, check out the virus' page on the Center for Disease Control website.

There is another cruise liner outbreak being reported, and it's not norovirus. According to the Italian news source, Il Messaggero (computer translated), the Costa Pacifica cruise ship has experienced an outbreak of the viral infection measles.

The report states that 59 crew members were sent ashore for medical treatment when the cruise ship docked in the port of Civitavecchia in Italy.

Concerning passengers onboard the cruise ship [loosely translated]: "Dozens of passengers probably infected with the virus that causes measles were disembarked. Many were unwell with fever and the 1st symptoms. There are at least 9 people already hospitalized in Spallanzani in Rome, but others from the port were transferred to hospitals in the capital and Orbetello."

The cruise line says no passengers have been confirmed as positive for the virus. "The outbreak of measles that was recorded on the cruise ship Costa Pacifica hit only the members of the crew, who were landed and isolated in accordance with procedures and health requirements. No suspected case of passengers who were on board and no passenger has been landed or hospitalized," stated the company. "All passengers have been adequately informed of the situation by the Captain of the ship."

The cruise line said appropriate health protocols and measures have been applied, and they are working closely with authorities. There is no official statement on the company's website as of this report.

There can be complications from measles, such as ear infections, pneumonia and encephalitis. For about one or 2 out of 1000 people that contract it, it turns out to be fatal.

[The outbreak appears quite widespread among the crew, but so far, no passengers have been reported to be affected. It seems very likely that there will be secondary cases among the passengers.

Otago schools, early childcare centres, and tertiary institutions are being warned by the Ministry of Health to be on the lookout for measles. This follows an outbreak of the highly infectious disease in the North Island.

At least 61 measles cases have been recorded in New Zealand in the past 3 months. Of those, 43 were in Auckland, 15 in the Bay of Plenty/Lakes district, and 3 in Wellington.

Public health officials are bracing for more after it was found 20 cases were pupils at Westlake Boys' High School in Auckland. The outbreak is believed to have originated in the Philippines, arriving in New Zealand via a hip-hop dance competition in Sydney, which was attended by a South Auckland 18-year-old.

Other outbreaks have occurred in recent months in Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom, Africa, Asia, India and North America.

Associate Health Minister Jo Goodhew said frontline health services, including travel clinics and emergency departments, were encouraged early last month [February 2014] to help counter the spread of measles. It is a highly infectious virus that spreads easily from person to person through the air, via breathing, coughing and sneezing. It is 4 times more infectious than influenza.

The ministry has sent information to education facilities across Otago, warning them to keep an eye out for children with symptoms. Parents were advised to make sure their children's measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccinations were up to date. The ministry said the best protection was the MMR vaccine, which was free for all children and adults born after 1 Jan 1969 who had not received 2 doses of a measles vaccine.

Affected people must stay away from school and follow the advice of their GPs. "Anyone who has not been fully immunised or those with no immunity to measles and who have been in close contact with a measles case during the infectious stages must stay away from school for 14 days from their last contact," the ministry said.

Kaikorai Valley College principal Rick Geerlof said teachers were being extra-vigilant. If a child became unwell with possible measles, the pupil would be separated from other children and sent to the office until being picked up. "This helps minimise the risk of measles spreading," Mr Geerlof said.

Mrs Goodhew said anyone who suspected they might have measles should call their GP or Healthline on 0800 611-116, as soon as possible.
