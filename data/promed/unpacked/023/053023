Trichinellosis, smoked warthog ham from Senegal
-----------------------------------------------
A small outbreak of at least 3 proven cases of trichinellosis was
identified in early May 2009 in France. The 3 patients, living in
different regions, were infected after consumption of smoked warthog
ham. There were no remains of the warthog ham that could be examined.

All patients were accommodated around mid February [2009] in the same
hotel of St Louis du Senegal. The usual clinical and biological signs
and symptoms (fever, facial and limb oedema, myalgia, and high
eosinophilia) appeared around mid March [2009].

All cases had a positive serology (ELISA and western blot) and in one
case seroconversion was observed. No cardiac or neurological
complications occurred. Only one patient was hospitalized and all
patients were treated with albendazole.

No other outbreaks related to warthog have been reported so far. The
hotel in which the French patients were infected, welcomes guests
from different European countries. If you are informed of related
cases, please contact the French National Reference Center on trichinellosis.

[Trichinellosis] has already been reported in Senegal when an
outbreak involving 9 persons occurred in the 60s. Subsequent
veterinary studies (Gretillat & Chevalier, 1970) reported a 4 percent
prevalence of trichinellosis in 450 Senegalese warthogs. Pozio et al
identified isolates from the neighbouring Guinea as belonging to the
species _Trichinella britovi_, but could not find _Trichinella_ in
any of the 10 examined warthogs.

[_Trichinella_ infections in humans and animals were reported from

identified _T. britovi_ from guinea (Pozio E et al. _Trichinella

The smoked warthog ham was probably imported to France without an
investigation for trichinellosis. - Mod.EP]
