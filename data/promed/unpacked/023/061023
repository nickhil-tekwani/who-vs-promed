The arrival of the rain is not always good news, as rats [and their fleas], the plague vectors, take refuge in habitats, wreaking havoc.

It is the beginning of the plague season on the Big Island and it is time to start worrying. 6 patients have died of the disease in a month. The Bongolava region has paid the highest price. "Of the 43 cases identified, 2 people died of bubonic plague on [2 Oct 2012], 2 others died on 5 Nov 2012, and another person died on 9 Nov 2012 person," the statistical management of health monitoring and epidemiological surveillance (DVSSE) within the Ministry of Public Health reported yesterday [14 Nov 2012].

However, this epidemic does not affect this region alone. Another victim of the plague was also registered in the District of Mandoto in Vakinankaratra, on 9 Oct 2012. The same day, 3 other non-fatal cases were found in the district of Ambalavao in the Haute-Matsiatra region.

The cause of this deadly epidemic seems always the same. "The plague victims sometimes live in remote areas and they self-medicate before going to a health center when the disease worsens. However, all health centers are equipped with rapid diagnostic test and medications to treat this disease immediately," said Alain Marcel Rahetilahy, head of epidemic and neglected diseases within the Ministry of Health. In contrast, the Regional Director of Public Health for Tsiroanomandidy refused to disclose the circumstances of this deadly epidemic in its domain, without the written permission of the Secretary General of the Ministry of Health.

However, Alain Marcel Rahetilahy does not want to dramatize the situation. "These cases have yet to be confirmed by the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar. And every year, only 30-40 percent of reported cases are confirmed, even if the initial result is positive by a rapid diagnosis test. So the situation is it not very disturbing," he reassured.

Yet other doctors remain cautious. "The heat, the rain, and the bushfires that devastated several regions in recent months, forced the rats, propagation vectors of the plague, to flee to the villages. This is why people must remain vigilant," warned a doctor who does not wish to reveal his name. And according to the Secretary General of the Ministry of Health, Philemon Tafangy, the number of suspected cases of plague is between 300 and 500 annually.

[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages. [The following paragraph of this posting is from 1998 (Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998; 4(1): 101-4: "Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had "virtually disappeared" on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health-management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form especially in the port of Mahajanga each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa."

Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy producing the purpura seen in the "Black Plague" and also spread to the lung causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.

Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med 1997; 337(10): 677-80). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear if this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread. - Mod.LL
