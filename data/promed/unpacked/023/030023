FSA statement on finding traces of MPA - an illegal hormone - in Dutch pig feed
---------
The Food Standards Agency is aware of reports from the Netherlands that
residues of the hormone, Medroxy Progesterone Acetate (MPA) have been found
in pig feed and that residues have also been found in Dutch pigs. While the
levels detected to date are not a cause for health concern, they are
illegal in the EU.
MPA is a synthetic hormone. In the EU it is banned for growth promotion
uses, but is authorized for limited veterinary use in ewes. In humans it
can be used in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for women going through
menopause and as a contraceptive in birth control pills. However, the
levels found in pigs would not affect people eating meat derived from them.
MPA is thought to have been present in glucose syrup, a raw material used
to make up the pig feed. The syrup was supplied to farmers by a specific
pig feed producer in Belgium, which is no longer in operation. There is no
indication that any affected feed or meat has been imported into the UK.
The Agency welcomes the swift actions of the Dutch authorities to test all
slaughtered animals and destroy any pig meat/pork products that test
positive for illegal MPA residues, and will be keeping in regular contact
with them.
The Agency has asked UK industry to ensure all imports of Dutch pig
meat/pork products are free from MPA residues. There is no indication that
either affected pig feed or glucose syrup for use in animal feed has been
imported from the Netherlands.
The EC Commission is urgently investigating the situation and an emergency
meeting, to be attended by the Food Standards Agency, is to be held in
Brussels this afternoon (10 Jul 2002).

EU takes action over food scare
-------------------------------
The European Union agreed on Wed 10 Jul 2002 to step up efforts to deal
with the latest food scare to rock the continent.
The EU's leading food safety committee heard reports from the Dutch,
Belgian, and Irish authorities on moves to trace the source of
contamination by medroxyprogesterone-acetate (MPA), a hormone used in the
human contraceptive pill, which is believed to have affected meat, animal
feed and possibly soft drinks.
The Standing Committee for the Food Chain and Animal Health met in special
session after the Belgian food safety agency announced this week it had
found traces of the banned hormone in materials supplied to two soft drink
producers by Bioland, a now-bankrupt Belgian company suspected of being
behind the scandal.
The Netherlands has agreed to block farms and feed producers potentially
affected by the contamination and to report on the results of test being
carried out. All other member states undertook to trace potentially
affected food or feed and to discover if companies on their territory were
customers of Bioland. They also agreed to verify whether pharmaceutical
waste, the likely cause of the contamination, was being correctly disposed of.
A scandal over the contamination of animal feed with dioxin - a highly
toxic chemical - was a significant factor in the downfall of the last
Belgian government and led to the tightening of EU feed regulations.

Brinkhorst, European penalty is a fable
----------------------------------------
Brussels/The Hague: Minister Brinkhorst of Agriculture has placed 2 new
farms under supervision because they have received suspect feed. The member
of the government contradicted on Wednesday remarks from Belgium to the
effect that 65 Dutch cattle farms and 300 pig and poultry farms would be
blockaded upon the direction of European veterinary experts.
"We have explained in Brussels what we have done the previous week. That we
have received the penalty from Europe is a fairy tale," said Brinkhorst
Wednesday night. The minister expects that the now in total 55 farms placed
under supervision can resume their activities in about a week.
The directorate of Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain
(FAVV) has caused a tumult by announcing the blockade of the Dutch farms.
European veterinary experts supposedly did this to prevent the prohibited
hormone MPA from ending up in the human food chain.
According to the FAVV Director, P. Vanthemsche, the contamination in
Holland seems to be more extensive than initially estimated. Brinkhorst
contradicts this. Vanthemsche said that Holland should provide its review
of the situation on all the blockaded farms the latest by Thursday morning,
so that the other EU member states can adopt their own preventive measures.
The member states have been guided to carry out extensive investigations in
their own countries as to whether similar cases have taken place.
According to FAVV, the source of the contamination is the IRISH company
Cara Environmental, that -- without informing the authorities-- has been
exporting, since 1995, medical waste contaminated with the pregnancy
hormone MPA. Cara has exported the product to, amongst others, Bioland in
the Belgian area of Arendonk, which manufactures glucose syrup. Bioland,
owned by 2 Dutch brothers, mixed the contaminated glucose syrup into animal
feed and exported that subsequently to Holland.
The soft drink industry is also burdened by the affair. Bioland delivered
glucose syrup also to soft drink producers. According to Vanthempsche, the
contaminated glucose syrup has supposedly been found, in the interim, at 4
soft drink factories, 2 in Belgium, 1 in Germany and 1 in Holland. In
Belgium, it is presumed that only the small west Flemish lemonade producer
Puck has received it. The name of the Dutch producer has not been revealed
yet. According to the Dutch authorities, MPA is not harmful to public health.

Banned hormone in soft drink and fed to pigs on 355 Dutch farms
---------------------------------------------------------------
International criminal investigations have been launched after traces of a
banned growth hormone were found at two soft drinks factories. The hormone,
MPA, could have been in glucose syrup sold by the bankrupt sugar waste
processor Bioland, based in Belgium.
MPA is a suspected cause of infertility and was found at two soft drinks
factories which sell to Germany and the Netherlands, according to European
food safety standards authorities. The hormone has also been found in pig
feed used by 355 Dutch farms, and in feed shipped back to Belgium and to
Germany, they said. The glucose syrup was also supplied to Dutch and German
food companies and may have been supplied to European breweries as well.
The European Commission has urged other member states to check whether
Bioland supplied firms in their countries. Eight EU countries are testing
foodstuffs and pig herds for the presence of the hormone.
One of the two Dutch brothers who own Bioland has been arrested in Belgium
and charged with breaches of hormone laws. Police are continuing a search
for the other man.
The Belgian authorities want to find out whether the hormone, which is
believed to have been part of a shipment of medical waste from Ireland, was
deliberately mixed into the glucose syrup.
The Dutch investigators want to find out whether the farmers and feed
producers added the hormone to the pig feed on purpose since MPA is
believed to boost a pig's weight.
The Irish authorities have also launched an investigation and other
European Union (EU) member states have followed suit since pigs fed with
the contaminated feed have been exported to Belgium, Germany, Italy, France
and Spain. There is also a slight risk of contamination in Britain and
Luxembourg.
Meanwhile, Belgian authorities have criticised the Irish for their failure
to inform them of the medical waste shipments.
Bioland had been cleared to process sugar waste but not to process medical
waste and not to supply the animal fodder industry. Bioland's glucose syrup
was up to 30 percent cheaper than that of its competitors because the
[other] company used wheat as a raw material while Bioland used waste
residue from sugar products. Bioland shipped the contaminated syrup
between a year and nine months ago.
The Dutch have been told by the European Union to seal off farms and feed
producers which appear to have been contaminated. "The Netherlands has to
make sure that they block all farms and feed producers potentially involved
in the incident," EU food safety experts said following an emergency meeting.
A leading Dutch farmers union has said it will sue Bioland for damages on
behalf of pig farmers affected by the quarantine.
The hormone MPA, or Medroxyprogesterone-acetate, is banned in the EU where
an order has gone out to destroy all products that contain it. In
Australia, New Zealand and the US it is used in birth control pills and in
hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women.

Food Chain Committee discussion on MPA-hormones in feed and food products
--------
Brussels: The Standing Committee for the Food Chain and Animal Health,
consisting of representatives of Member States, heard detailed reports by
the Dutch, Belgian and Irish authorities on the state of play of their
investigations. The European Commission concluded the discussions as
follows, to which all Member States agreed:
1. The Netherlands has to make sure that they block all farms and feed
producers potentially involved in the incident and has to circulate
immediately a full list of all these farms and feed producers. The
Netherlands shall also immediately communicate all test results obtained to
the Commission and the Member States on
an ongoing basis;
2. All Member States will continue to trace potentially affected feed and
food, block establishments concerned and test possibly affected products;
3. All Member States will verify whether domestic companies were clients of
the Belgian company Bioland;
4. All Member States will continue to send any new information through the
European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed to ensure that all members of
the network have immediate access to all available information;
5. Ireland and Belgium will continue their investigation;
6. All Member States should verify that pharmaceutical waste on their
territory is disposed of correctly.
The Food Chain Committee will discuss again the situation next Tues 16 Jul
2002 in the afternoon, during its regular meeting.

[MPA seems to join MBM (Meat and bone meals) and frying oil within an
infamous list of food-safety affairs that were strongly related to
recycling - a term which has lost some of its attractiveness following the
BSE and dioxin scandals. Previous experience shows that such an issue
becomes international within days, if not hours. It remains to be seen if
this new one will enjoy an improved crisis management.
ProMED-mail is very grateful to Edu Wijdeveld (Baarn) for bringing the
subject initially to our attention- Mod. AS]
[Medroxyprogesterone acetate is a drug which is used in the treatment of
some cancers. It is a man-made drug which is similar to the female hormone
progesterone. Hormones are substances which are produced naturally in the
body, where they act as chemical messengers and help control the activity
of cells and organs. It is mainly used in the treatment of breast cancer,
but may also be used to treat cancer of the uterus (womb) and occasionally
prostate cancer. It may also be used to treat cancer of the kidney
(hypernephroma) but it is not known how it works in this situation. - Mod.TG]
