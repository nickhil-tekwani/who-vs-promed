Mysterious disease killing livestock
------------------------------------
Dozens of the livestock were killed here [Miram Shah, Federally
Administered Tribal Areas] on daily basis owing to a mysterious
disease of cattle, residents of the North Waziristan Tuesday [3 Mar
2009] said. The elders of the Muski tribesmen including Malik Rasul
Khan, Muqarab Khan, and Aurangzeb told "The News" that so far 60
cattle head had been killed due to the unknown disease. They demanded
of the relevant authorities to send teams of veterinary experts to
the area, as livestock was the backbone of the rural economy in the
area for the impoverished people.

[In the absence of information on the clinical signs, age, and
husbandry of the affected animals and PM (post-mortem) changes, there
is no room for hypotheses on the background to this event, which can
have infectious etiology or otherwise. Zoonotic disease agents should
be taken into consideration as well. Such information, and --
hopefully -- laboratory involvement, are anticipated.
