An official at a Jakarta hospital said on Friday [12 Jan 2007] that a
woman had died of bird flu and 4 other people were being treated for
symptoms of H5N1 virus infection, which many scientists fear could
mutate and trigger the next global flu pandemic in people. The dead
woman's husband and son were among those in hospital as suspected
cases of infection but there was no evidence of human-to-human
transmission of the virus, a senior health official said.
In Indonesia, 2 women in their 20s are also being treated for bird
flu symptoms. Tests have confirmed one of the patients, aged 22, is
infected with the virus. Muchtar Ichsan, head of the bird flu ward at
Jakarta's Persahabatan hospital, said the women -- one from Tangerang
west of Jakarta and the other from a South Jakarta suburb -- were in
critical condition and had been placed on a respirator. The
22-year-old woman had a history of contact with chickens but it was
not clear if the other woman, who was 4 years older, had had contact
with sick birds, Ichsan said.
Bayu Krisnamurthi, head of the national commission on avian
influenza, said there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission
of the virus in the latest suspected and confirmed cases. He also
believed Indonesia was making progress fighting the virus, but added:
"The danger is still there and the nature of this virus is random,"
he told a news conference. Since late 2003, when the H5N1 virus
re-emerged in Asia, bird flu has killed 158 people worldwide.
Indonesia, with 59 deaths, has the highest human toll of any nation.

[The identify of the deceased 22-year-old woman described in this
report is problematic. Here she is identified as the 59th fatality,
in which case shes may be the unnamed woman described in part [1] of
the previous post (Avian influenza, human (09): Indonesia
20070111.0133) whose husband and son were admitted to hospital at the
same time. Clarification is awaited. - Mod.CP]
