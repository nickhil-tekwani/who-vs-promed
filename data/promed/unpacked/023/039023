Some 750 pelicans found dead in a UNESCO World Heritage site in northern Senegal last week [18 - 24 Jan 2021] have tested positive for H5N1 bird flu, the head of the parks authority told Reuters on [Fri 29 Jan 2021]. Rangers found the pelicans on [23 Jan 2021] in the Djoudj bird sanctuary, a remote pocket of wetland near the border with Mauritania and a resting place for birds that cross the Sahara Desert into West Africa each year. The birds were incinerated and the park is closed, said Bocar Thiam, Senegal's parks director.

The sanctuary is a transit place for about 350 species of birds but only pelicans were found dead.

This month [January 2021], Senegal reported an outbreak of H5N1 on a poultry farm in the Thies region about 120 mi [about 193 km] south, resulting in the culling of about 100 000 chickens. It is not clear if the 2 outbreaks are linked.

[HPAI viruses emerged in western Africa in 2006 and reemerged in 2015. No outbreaks of HPAI had been reported in Senegal until very recently (end of 2020; ProMED archive number 20210108.8085504), when an outbreak in a poultry farm due to H5N1 was documented 200 km (about 124 mi) south of Djoudj bird sanctuary. The temporal and spatial correlation between these 2 outbreaks strongly suggests they might be linked. - Mod.PMB
