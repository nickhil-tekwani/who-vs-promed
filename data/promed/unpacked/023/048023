Public health officials are urging the public to take extra precautions with their pets and surroundings following the death this week of an unidentified local resident who had contracted Rocky Mountain spotted fever [RMSF], which is a tick-borne disease, officials said. The individual visited a local hospital in May 2014 after feeling ill with fever, nausea, and vomiting but was unable to recover, said Imperial County Health Officer Dr Stephen Munday, in a press release.

It is unknown where the individual contracted the disease, Munday stated. Public health officials continue to investigate the death and are monitoring and testing ticks around the individual's home and property. The death is the 1st case due to RMSF reported in Imperial County.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever is caused by the bacterium _Rickettsia rickettsii_ and is potentially fatal when contracted by humans, the press release stated. The brown dog tick has been identified as a reservoir of _R. rickettsii_. Almost all of the reported cases of RMSF in the Southwest have occurred within communities with a large number of free-roaming dogs, the press reported.

[It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to minimize morbidity and mortality.

When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed.

After attaching, it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, fever, muscle pains, headache (but the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric involving the palms and soles as well as spreading proximally to the truck. Purpura usually are not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.

The female _Dermacentor variabilis_ (the American dog tick), a common vector for this infection, can be seen at http://bit.ly/1lkwxId.
