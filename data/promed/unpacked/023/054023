Bluetongue virus (BTV-8) in France
----------------------------
1. Disease report
France has now reported a total of 285 [287, as of 10 Jun 2016] outbreaks of BTV-8. The restriction zones have not changed in coverage, but all of the seasonally free zones have been revoked. All the recent outbreaks are in cattle holdings, detected by surveillance activities, although the likely date of infection is not clear. No increase in spread towards the north coast of France has been reported, but cases have been detected through surveillance towards the northerly area of the restriction zone.

2. Situation assessment
The French authorities have reported on their recent surveillance activities (Bournier et al, 2016 at http://www.plateforme-esa.fr/article/point-de-situation-fco-%E2%80%93-13-mai-2016).

Between September 2015 and April 2016, a very high number of animals (nearly 80 000 animals, of which 99.7 per cent were cattle) have been tested under the programme for testing animals to be moved out of the zone. Suspect clinical cases were reported in 570 farms during this same period, but only 13 farms had animals testing positive.

In addition, they have provided useful information on the small number of clinical cases on 11 of the farms which have been reported, and this list is a translation [from the mentioned report by Bournier et al, published 13 May 2016]:

"For cattle (7 singleton animals from 7 individual farms), 5 of these animals had clinical features of BTV (discharge, irritation of the muzzle, stiffness of the limbs); one case was detected following an abortion (PCR positive result on the runt); one animal presented only general signs (hyperthermia, depression). One animal with clinical suspicion of BTV gave a positive PCR result, but there was no information on clinical signs, and the animal died a few days after visiting the vet.

- hyperthermia (5/7) and inappetance (4/7)
- erosions on (5/7) or congestion of (4/7) the muzzle
- conjunctivitis/lacrimation (4/7) nasal discharge (3/7), excess salivation (2/7)
- facial oedema (2/7) and cyanotic tongue (1/7)
- difficulty in breathing (tachypnea, dyspnea, wheezing) (2/7)
- Problems with the limbs: stiffness (1/7), edema/congestion of the coronary band with limb edema (1/7). No lameness observed or inability to stand
- weight loss/muscle wasting (1/7)
- congestion teat/udder (1/7)
- abortion (1/7) [the offspring also tested positive].

"For sheep (4 animals from 4 farms), 3 of the animals showed clinical signs characteristic of BTV (discharge, irritation of the muzzle, face edema, salivation). One animal was detected following a series of abortions in the herd (6 abortions) with nervous signs/torticollis in newborn lambs (which does not correspond to conventionally observed signs) and positive PCR results in the mother and the lambs; test results were negative for Schmallenberg virus.

- hyperthermia (3/4) and inappetance (1/4)
- erosions on (0/4) or congestion of (1/4) the muzzle
- conjunctivitis/lacrimation (1/4) nasal discharge (1/4), excess salivation (1/4)
- facial oedema (1/4) and cyanotic tongue (1/4)
- difficulty in breathing (tachypnea, dyspnea, wheezing) (1/4)
- problems with the limbs: stiffness (0/4), edema/congestion of the coronary band with limb edema (0/4); lameness observed (1/4),
- weight loss/muscle wasting (0/4)
- abortion (1/7) (the offspring also tested positive).

"These types of clinical signs being seen are not pathognomic for BTV; they could be suggestive of a number of different diseases and causes. Overall, the number of detections of BTV following clinical suspicion is very low across all the mainland (3 per cent) although higher within the centrally affected regions (Allier, Creuse, Loire and Puy-de-Dome).

"Although in 2007-8 the majority of outbreaks were reported as a result of clinical suspicion, only a small proportion of animals in each outbreak were actually clinically affected." [end translation].

Another item of interest in the report is about test results for the PCR positive tests. The Ct value for a PCR represents the number of PCR cycles required for the test to produce a positive result (above a threshold of detection), so the higher the figure, the lower the level of viral RNA present in the sample. Ct values varied between September and December 2015 at between 20 and 38. Values increased after January 2016 to between 30 and 35, and since April 2016, most samples have a higher than 35 Ct value. This is particularly significant, as the likely infectivity of an infected animal decreases with a higher Ct value, so although cases are still being detected, they may not represent a significantly high risk of transmission of BTV at present. Current opinion is that an animal with a Ct value below 32 is viraemic and may be infectious.

A batch of the bluetongue vaccines, Zulvac 8 Bovis and Zulvac 8 Ovis, is expected to become available to veterinary practices in mid-July 2016:

http://mrcvs.co.uk/en/news/14571/Bluetongue-vaccine-to-become-available.

MSD Animal Health has signed an agreement with the Spanish-based biopharmaceutical specialist CZ Veterinaria SA (CZV) to distribute its bluetongue vaccine (BLUEVAC BTV8) throughout Great Britain. For information, see the announcement by the NFU at http://www.nfuonline.com/bluetongue.

3. Conclusion
Our risk level remains the same, however the weather is starting to improve, and as daily average temperatures increase in mainland France and the UK, our risk level will start to increase. It is worth noting the variability of clinical signs when considering BTV as a possible differential diagnosis. BTV-8 is an unusual virus in the way it is transmitted transplacentally; therefore, young animals born to positive dams/ewes may be viraemic and represent a source of new disease outbreaks, even if the adult animals have very high Ct values. We will continue to monitor the current situation in France and report any further updates from the French authorities.

Vaccine has been made available for the GB market from July 2016 onwards, but the decision to vaccinate should be with the farmer, in consultation with their private veterinary surgeon.

[The above DEFRA update's information, including the cited comprehensive paper by Bournier and colleagues (recommended reading), is in line with previous ProMED-mail postings indicating that BTV-8 circulation in France was minimal if not absent during the winter months. This may change during the commencing vector season unless prevented by vaccination.

A previous DEFRA assessment of BTV-8 in France, No. 4, published 30 Mar 2016, was summarised in 20160409.4149402; the total number of accumulated reported outbreaks in France at that time was 237. Since then, 47 reported outbreaks have been added. The current, updated total number of reported BTV-8 outbreaks since the start of the event on 21 Aug 2015, as presented in OIE's archive, has risen to 284. This includes the information of the recent follow-up report No. 35 of 6 Jun 2016:

Outbreak summary: Total outbreaks = 284 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 50 990 / 399 / 2 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 2907 / 16 / 0 / 1 / 0
Sheep & goats / 161 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Goats / - / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

The archived report includes all 36 submissions since the start of the event and a map showing all reported outbreaks, and is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000020279_20160608_183924.pdf. - Mod.AS
