[1] Liberia: Ebola returns
Date: 26 Apr 2016

Ebola has returned to Liberia, one of 3 countries hit hardest by the worst Ebola outbreak in history. There have been more than 10 600 cases and over 4800 deaths, according to the World Health Organisation.

Three members of a family in Liberia have contracted Ebola 2 months after the country was declared free of the virus, health officials said on Fri [23 Apr 2016].

The 1st documented case in the family was a 10-year-old boy who started showing symptoms last week, said a Liberian health official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

After attending school on Mon [19 Apr 2016] and Tue [20 Apr 2016], the boy was admitted to a hospital and was transported to an Ebola treatment unit on Wed [21 Apr 2016], the official said.

The boy's test came back positive on Thu [22 Apr 2016], as did subsequent tests for his father and a sibling, the official said, adding that at least 7 health care workers may have treated him without the protective equipment essential for Ebola cases.

The World Health Organization declared Liberia free of Ebola on 9 May [2015], but a resurgence of the disease the next month sickened 4 people, 2 of whom died. The country was declared Ebola-free again on 3 Sep [2015].

In Geneva, Dr. Bruce Aylward, the World Health Organization's special representative for the Ebola response and deputy director general for outbreaks and health emergencies, told officials that the new case had not dimmed hopes that West African countries might still be moving toward eliminating the original outbreak.

The boy's case appears to point to the persistence of the virus among survivors, which can result in occasional resurgence of the disease, Dr. Aylward said, adding that flare-ups are expected to be less common and to end in 2016.

In October [2015], Pauline Cafferkey, a British nurse who contracted Ebola while doing aid work in Sierra Leone and was thought to have recovered in January [2016], fell ill again due to a complication from the virus. She was recently released from the hospital and is believed to be in good health again. Ian Crozier, an American doctor also thought to have been cured of Ebola, revealed that he had had significant vision problems due to the virus in his eye.

Since the spring of 2014, Liberia has suffered more than 10 600 cases and seen 4808 deaths. It was the 1st of 3 countries impacted most severely by the virus to be declared free of the virus in May [2015] and again in September [2015]. Sierra Leone passed that milestone on 7 Nov [2015]. Guinea recently began the 42-day countdown from when the last patient tested negative for a 2nd time.

Dr. Aylward said the boy had no known contacts with a survivor or a history of travel that might have put him at risk. "The investigation is ongoing," Dr. Aylward said. "The country has moved extremely quickly."

He said the latest developments were the 7th time the W.H.O. suspected that a flare-up was related to the persistence of the virus in the population of survivors. For example, scientists have shown that the virus remains present for months in the semen of some men who recover from the disease, and could, in rare cases, be transmitted through unprotected sex.

In all cases, however, transmission has been stopped quickly, with a low number of subsequent cases. New tools include an experimental vaccine that can be given to those who come into contact with patients.

The new case highlighted the importance of maintaining strong surveillance programs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said in a statement that it was working closely with the Liberian government and with international organizations. It noted that sporadic cases had been expected in Liberia, even though it had been declared free of Ebola.

"Even though it has been nearly 4 months since the last Ebola patient was discharged from a Liberian Ebola treatment unit, Liberia has maintained a heightened state of vigilance," the C.D.C. said in the statement. "Responders have proven to be effective in rapidly identifying, isolating and treating new cases. As the situation continues to evolve, C.D.C. and partners are working hard to rapidly control this case."

On Sun [24 Apr 2016], a committee appointed by the W.H.O.'s director general called for overhauls at the agency in the wake of the epidemic, including integrating emergency response and outbreak control functions, with oversight by an independent body. Three other panels, including one convened by Harvard and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and another by the National Academy of Medicine, are expected to release recommendations on preventing and controlling future pandemics in the coming weeks.

Liberia was 1st declared Ebola-free on 9 May [2015], but new cases emerged in June 2015 resulting in 2 deaths. The WHO declared the country Ebola-free again on 3 Sep [2015].

The new case is a 10-year-old boy who lives in the eastern Paynesville district of Monrovia, said Francis Kateh, chief medical officer and acting head of Liberia's Ebola Case Management System.

Dr Kateh said the boy was being taken to a treatment centre outside Monrovia.

"Yes, yes, you can say confirmed," he said when asked if the case had been confirmed to be Ebola. He added that officials were trying to find out how the boy contracted the disease. On Thu night [22 Apr 2016], before the new case was reported, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf delivered a speech praising "the resilience" of Liberians in overcoming Ebola.

"Without the individual and collective support and co-operation of all our citizens and residents, it would have been difficult to defeat this scourge," Ms Sirleaf said.

The new case in Liberia was announced days after Guinea, the country where the epidemic started, said it had no more Ebola cases and was beginning a 42-day countdown towards being declared free of Ebola transmission.

Because of the persistence of virus in humans as well as wildlife, it may not be possible to completely eliminate Ebola from the environment in West Africa, at least in the near term. If it is kept under control, eventually it may be eliminated locally. If clinics follow appropriate biosafety protocols to prevent spread of the virus, with use of personal protective equipment if available, Ebola should be able to be kept to a minimum of cases. Vaccination also will help control spread. - Mod.LK]

20 Apr 2016 Guinea: Last known Ebola patient discharged in Guinea
http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-04-ebola-patient-discharged-guinea.html
[Guinea's health authorities and the medical charity treating the last known [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] patient in the country said Wed [20 Apr 2016] he had been discharged after successfully recovering from the disease.

The elderly man was shown smiling broadly in images released by the ALIMA medical charity, which treated him at their dedicated unit in the southern city of Nzerekore.

According to Fode Tass Sylla, spokesperson for Guinea's EVD response unit, "The last current confirmed case of Ebola hospitalized in Nzerekore left last night [Tue 19 April 2016] fully recovered, and has gone home."

"There are no more current confirmed cases in hospital and no suspected ones admitted to the center for the moment," the Alliance For International Medical Action (ALIMA) said in a statement.]

26 Apr 2016 Guinea: Ebola virus; Guinea authorities start count down to end Ebola in Guinea
http://www.albanydailystar.com/health/after-2-years-finally-end-of-ebola-in-guinea-bellevue-tech-time-10627.html
[Authorities have started the countdown to the end of Ebola in Guinea, the last country still reporting cases after nearly 2 years. The patient's recovery and the lack of new cases raise hopes that Guinea -- and the world -- could end Ebola transmission before the end of the year [2016]. Guinea must still go 42 days without any new cases and after that must maintain a period of heightened surveillance.

Health officials performed a 2nd test Mon [27 Apr 2016] on a baby whose mother had died in October [2015] from Ebola. "The baby is negative, and so Guinea today [26 Apr 2016] is without a single Ebola patient," said Fode Tass Sylla, spokesman for Guinea's national Ebola response taskforce. "We are crossing our fingers and praying that nothing will happen over the next 42 days so that we can celebrate Guinea without Ebola."

The World Health Organization declares that Ebola disease transmission has ended when the country goes through 2 incubation periods -- 21 days each -- without a new case emerging. The other 2 countries hardest hit by the virus -- Sierra Leone and Liberia -- already have reached that benchmark. But authorities in Guinea said they continued to face resistance in fearful communities, where people initially blamed international health workers for bringing the virus to their region. Many preferred to bring their sick to traditional healers instead of Ebola clinics and often buried the dead without conforming to the health rules that were designed to prevent mourners from being infected by corpses.

A baby girl in Guinea, who was the last known Ebola patient in a 2-year regional epidemic, has recovered from the disease but remained under surveillance at a medical facility in the capital Conakry on Tuesday [26 Apr 2016], health officials said. The baby's recovery means that Guinea, the last country still battling the virus, can begin its 42-day countdown to declaring an end to outbreak.

In a major breakthrough, neighboring Sierra Leone was declared Ebola-free on 7 Nov [2015]. "We did 2 tests that turned up negative. She is completely cured of Ebola," said Fodé Tass Sylla, spokesman for Guinea's Ebola coordination unit. The baby was born on 27 Oct [2015] in the Nongo Ebola treatment center to an infected mother who did not survive. Nubia received treatment from medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).

"We are pleased that she has been tested negative, but as she is the 1st infected baby to have recovered, she will continue to receive specialized medical support before going back home," said Laurence Sailly, MSF's emergency coordinator in Guinea.

68 people who had been in contact with the country's last cluster of patients and were deemed at risk of developing the hemorrhagic fever were released from quarantine on Sat [24 Apr 2016].

The epidemic, the worst known Ebola outbreak in history, began in Guinea's forest region nearly 2 years ago and has since killed around 11 300 people, nearly all of them in West African neighbors Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. ...more]

27 Apr 2016 USA: Center for Strategic and International Studies releases U.S. Ebola response documentary
https://homelandprepnews.com/countermeasures/18695-center-strategic-international-studies-releases-u-s-ebola-response-documentary/
[The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) released a feature-length documentary on Fri [22 Apr 2016] entitled "Ebola in America: Epidemic of Fear," based on the timeline of the [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] crisis and how the United States responded to it.

The documentary contains interviews from those most intimately involved in the crisis, including missionary Dr. Kent Brantly, the 1st American to return to the U.S. for treatment of EVD. The documentary also focuses on the efforts the U.S. took to respond EVD, with additional insight from interviews with White House Ebola Czar Ron Klain, CDC Director Tom Frieden and other prominent 1st responders who became involved in countering the outbreak.

According to Dr. J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president and director of CSIS's Global Health Policy Center and leader of the project, "When Ebola arrived in America in 2014, it ignited the best and the worst in us, including fear, panic, stigma, confrontation, and confusion, and courage and leadership. We've tried to unpack this turbulence through the eyes of different key individuals on the front lines. Their story resonates today as we face Zika and the threat of infants born with brain damage."]

27 Apr 2016 USA: Senator introduces legislation to fight diseases such as Zika and Ebola: Al Franken of Minnesota aims to establish a coordinated One Health response to animal disease outbreaks.
http://veterinarynews.dvm360.com/senator-introduces-legislation-fight-diseases-such-zika-and-ebola
[US Senator Al Franken (Dem-MN) endeavors to establish a coordinated One Health response to zoonotic disease outbreaks. The One Health Act of 2016 would task the nation's regulatory agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control, Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to work together to understand, prevent and respond to zoonotic disease outbreaks. If passed, the One Health Act of 2016 would also create competitive grant programs to carry out the programs outlined in the framework and stimulate collaboration between health programs at the state and local level. The legislation also urges international health organizations to increase investments in One Health approaches to global health security.]

23 Apr 2016: Neurologic problems common in Ebola survivors
http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/AAN/57503
[According to Lauren Bowen, MD, a National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke clinical fellow, speaking at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting, nearly all Liberian [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] survivors examined in a study conducted by National Institutes of Health researchers reported neurological symptoms, persisting in many cases for more than a year.

About 75 percent of the 164 survivors studied as of February 2016 reported experiencing headaches during or after stays in Ebola treatment units, and 50 percent reported difficulty walking and overall muscle weakness, Moreover, headache, depression, and memory loss continued in 50 percent or more when interviewed a year or more after treatment unit discharge.

Dr Bowen said one of the most surprising findings was the frequency of hallucinations, some of which were very concerning. Bowen mentioned 10-year-olds having hallucinations severe enough to require psychiatric hospitalization.

Almost 25 percent of the sample reported having hallucinations during or after their treatment unit stays. These tended not to be persistent, with only 4 percent reporting such symptoms at follow-up. However, Dr. Bowen said this is still far above the level expected in the general Liberian population.

Sexual dysfunction was noted in 29 percent of subjects, with most of the sexual problems of the under-functioning type, but hypersexuality was reported by some participants.

Less common symptoms included tremor, abnormal thoughts and behaviors, and incontinence.]
