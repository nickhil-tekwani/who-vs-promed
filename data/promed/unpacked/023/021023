Update: vaccine-derived polioviruses-worldwide, January 2008 to June 2009
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In 1988, the World Health Assembly resolved to eradicate
poliomyelitis worldwide (1). Subsequently, the Global Polio
Eradication Initiative of the World Health Organization (WHO) reduced
the global incidence of polio associated with wild polioviruses
(WPVs) from an estimated 350 000 cases in 125 countries in 1988 to
1651 reported cases in 2008 and reduced the number of countries that
have never interrupted WPV transmission to four (Afghanistan, India,
Nigeria, and Pakistan) (1). Under current WHO plans, when the goal of
eradicating all WPV transmission is attained, oral poliovirus vaccine
(OPV) use worldwide eventually will be discontinued. However, because
vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) can produce polio outbreaks in
areas with low rates of Sabin OPV coverage and can replicate for
years in immunodeficient persons, enhanced strategies are needed to
limit emergence of VDPVs (2).

This report updates previous summaries (3,4) and describes VDPVs
detected worldwide during January 2008 to June 2009. During this
period,
- 2 new outbreaks of circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs) (accounting for 4-20
cases) were identified in the Democratic Republic of Congo and
Ethiopia;
- a previously identified outbreak in Nigeria ultimately resulted in
a cumulative total of 292 cases;
- 2 newly identified paralyzed immunodeficient persons in Argentina
and the United States were found to excrete VDPVs; and
- isolated VDPVs were found among persons and environmental samples
in 11 countries.
All countries need to maintain
- high rates of poliovirus vaccination coverage to prevent VDPV spread and
- sensitive poliovirus surveillance to detect VDPVs.

Properties of VDPVs
-------------------
VDPVs can cause paralytic polio in humans and have the potential for
sustained circulation. VDPVs resemble WPVs biologically (2) and
differ from most Sabin vaccine-related poliovirus (VRPV) isolates by
having genetic properties consistent with prolonged replication or
transmission. Because poliovirus genomes evolve at a rate of
approximately 1 percent per year, Sabin VRPV isolates that differ
from the corresponding OPV strain by more than 1 percent of
nucleotide positions (usually determined by sequencing the genomic
region encoding the major viral surface protein, VP1) are estimated
to have replicated for at least 1 year in one or more persons after
administration of an OPV dose. This is substantially longer than the
normal period of vaccine virus replication of 4-6 weeks in an OPV
recipient.

Poliovirus isolates are divided into 3 serotypes: type 1, type 2, and
type 3. Isolates are divided further into 3 categories, based on the
extent of VP1 nucleotide sequence divergence from the corresponding
Sabin OPV strain:
1. Sabin VRPVs (less than or equal to 1 percent divergent);
2. VDPVs (VRPVs that are more than 1 percent divergent from the
corresponding Sabin strain), and
3. WPVs (no genetic evidence of derivation from any vaccine strain) (3).

VDPVs are further categorized as
- circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs), when evidence of person-to-person
transmission in the community exists;
- immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs), which are isolated
from persons with primary immunodeficiencies who have prolonged VDPV
infections; and
- ambiguous VDPVs (aVDPVs), which are either clinical isolates from
persons with no known immunodeficiency or sewage isolates whose
ultimate source is unknown (2).

Virologic testing for VDPVs
---------------------------
Soon after the recognition of a cVDPV outbreak in Hispaniola in 2001
laboratories of the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN)
implemented a protocol to screen for VDPVs, using a combination of
molecular and antigenic methods. VRPV isolates identified by
molecular methods that had "non-vaccine-like" antigenic properties
were candidate VDPVs and were sequenced (2). However, since 2007,
some VDPVs, especially less divergent type 2 VDPV (VDPV2) isolates,
have undergone limited antigenic evolution and were missed by this
screening protocol. A new method based on real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), which targets
nucleotide substitutions that occur early in VDPV emergence, has been
evaluated and shown to detect VDPVs with much higher sensitivity and
is being implemented as a routine screening method by GPLN as of 2009
(5).

cVDPV
-----
Democratic Republic of Congo
----------------------------
Retrospective and ongoing characterization of Sabin 2-related
isolates by rRT-PCR found 20 acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases
associated with cVDPV2 (1.1 percent-2.0 percent divergent) during
2005-2009 [Illustrated graphically in the original text]. Most (n =
15) cases occurred in Katanga Province during 2008-2009, but others
occurred in Bandundu (n = 2) in 2005, Sud-Kivu (n = 1) in 2007,
Orientale (n = 1) in 2007, and Kasai-Occidental (n = 1) in 2008. The
Katanga and Kasai-Occidental isolates had diverged into 2 main
clusters of related lineages, whereas the remaining isolates were
unlinked genetically. An additional 13 Sabin 2-related isolates with
0.6 percent-1.0 percent VP1 divergence were found in Katanga and
elsewhere, some of which clustered geographically and genetically
with outbreak viruses.

Ethiopia
--------
4 closely-related cVDPV2 isolates (1.1 percent-1.2 percent divergent)
were isolated during October 2008 and February 2009 from AFP patients
in East Harerghe.

Guinea
-----
A girl aged 6 years, who had received 1 dose of OPV in 2003 and was
living in a camp for refugees from Cote d'Ivoire, had AFP onset in
May 2009. A VDPV2 (3.5 percent divergent) was isolated and was found
to be closely related to several 2008-2009 cVDPV2 isolates from
northern Nigeria.

Nigeria
-------
Since 2005, 292 AFP cases associated with an outbreak of cVDPV2 have
been reported in 11 northern and 3 central states of Nigeria. The
outbreak is ongoing, with one case in 2005, 20 in 2006, 68 in 2007,
63 in 2008, and 140 during January-June 2009. 28 percent (81 of 292)
of all cVDPV isolates were from Kano state, which has been a major
reservoir for WPV type 1 (WPV1) and WPV3 circulation within Nigeria
(1,3). However, the proportion of cVDPV cases occurring outside of
Kano increased to 81 percent during January 2008-June 2009. Genetic
analysis of outbreak viruses indicated that the detected cases
actually represent several concurrent outbreaks arising from multiple
independent cVDPV2 emergences during 2004-2006.

VDPV circulation was largely limited to the northern Nigerian states,
where WPV1 and WPV3 circulation has continued (1). 2 independent
introductions of cVDPV2 into the Republic of Niger from Nigeria were
detected in 2006 (3), and an introduction into Guinea was found in
2009. By comparison, WPV1 and WPV3 from Nigeria have spread widely in
neighboring countries of Africa (6).

Of the 26 targeted supplementary immunization activities (SIAs)
conducted in Nigeria since 2006, 16 have used monovalent OPV type 1
(mOPV1), 5 have used mOPV3, and 6 have used trivalent OPV (tOPV)
(most recently during 30 May-2 Jun 2009 [as of 30 Jun 2009]). Routine
immunization uses tOPV, but its use is estimated to be only 61
percent nationwide and much lower in the northern states.

iVDPVs
------
Since the introduction of OPV in 1961, approximately 40 persons with
B-cell immunodeficiencies have been found to be excreting iVDPVs,
which are indicative of prolonged infections. Currently, no effective
therapies to clear iVDPV infections are available.

Argentina
---------
A boy aged 15 months with x-linked agammaglobulinemia, who had
received three OPV doses in his 1st months of life, developed AFP in
April 2009. iVDPV1 (3.6 percent-3.8 percent divergent) was isolated
from 2 serial stool specimens. No other VDPVs were detected among 87
contacts tested.

United States
-------------
OPV use in the United States ceased after 1999. In December 2008, a
woman aged 44 years with a more than 20 year history of
common-variable immunodeficiency developed ascending paralysis in all
limbs and respiratory insufficiency. She died in March 2009 from
various complications of her chronic illness, including neurologic
sequelae. Highly divergent (12.3 percent) iVDPV2 was isolated from a
pre-mortem stool specimen. A household member had received 3 OPV
doses 13 years before onset of AFP in the decedent, and the estimated
age of the iVDPV2 suggests that one of those doses could have been
the source of exposure. This infection is independent of the VDPV1
that circulated in an undervaccinated rural Minnesota community in
2005 (7).

aVDPVs
------
aVDPVs have been isolated in 11 countries during January 2008-June
2009 [data tabulated in the original text]). Descriptions of the most
divergent aVDPVs, all from sewage samples, follow.

Estonia
-------
Highly divergent (approximately 15 percent) aVDPV2 and aVDPV3 were
isolated from separate sewage samples taken in September and December
2008. The isolates had sequence properties that suggested that they
originated from a common infection, and the aVDPV3 is related to
another Estonian aVDPV3 isolated from sewage described previously
(2,8).

Finland
--------
Highly divergent (approximately 15 percent) aVDPV1, aVDPV2, and
aVDPV3 were isolated from sewage samples collected in Tampere in
December 2008 and June 2009. The isolates had sequence properties
that suggested that they originated from a common infection. The
Finnish aVDPVs are distinct from the Estonian aVDPVs.

Israel
------
Environmental monitoring for polioviruses was implemented by Israel
after its 1987-1988 WPV1 outbreak. Monitoring sewage samples from the
Tel Aviv area (sampling populations of approximately 350 000 and 10
000) yielded 2 groups of type 2 aVDPVs (9). The 1st group was
detected initially in 1998, and 19 more highly divergent
representatives (approximately 15 percent divergent) were detected
during 2008-2009. The 2nd group, detected since 2006, is less
divergent (approximately 7 percent) and is defined by 10 isolates.
Despite follow-up investigations, no source for these VDPVs has been
identified. An aVDPV1 (8.2 percent divergent) was isolated from an
environmental sample collected from a site sampling a different
population in Haifa on 22 Feb 2009.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
The recent VDPV emergences reinforce some key lessons for the Global
Polio Eradication Initiative. The cVDPV2 outbreak in Nigeria, whose
4-year duration is surpassed only by the decade-long cVDPV2 outbreak
in Egypt during 1983-1993 (10), further demonstrates that cVDPVs,
like WPV, can circulate indefinitely in settings with low rates of
poliovirus vaccination coverage. The emergence of multiple
independent cVDPV2 lineages in Nigeria and the unrelated cVDPV2
outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia highlight
the particular risks for emergence of cVDPV2 in settings of low tOPV
coverage (10). Improvements in laboratory methods for the
identification of VDPV2 facilitated early detection of the outbreaks
in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia, but maintenance of
sensitive AFP surveillance was crucial; any temporal and geographic
clustering of vaccine-related isolates of the same serotype should
prompt further investigation.

The appearance of an iVDPV case in the United States 13 years after
the likely exposure and 9 years after cessation of OPV use
illustrates the continued risk among immunodeficient persons from
past OPV use. Chronic iVDPV excretors (that is, excretion for more
than 5 years) have been described in several countries that have
shifted to inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) (2), and the highly
divergent aVDPVs found in sewage in Israel, Estonia, and Finland have
similar genetic properties to iVDPVs from chronic excretors. The
appearance of an iVDPV case in Argentina further underscores the
risks of prolonged iVDPV excretion in middle-income countries (2,3).

Several of the aVDPVs described in this report show only limited
divergence (1.1 percent-1.5 percent) and were detected after
implementation of the new rRT-PCR screening methods. In some settings
such isolates are observed sporadically, and no genetically linked
VDPVs are found subsequently. However, in settings of potential low
local tOPV coverage, the sporadic detection of aVDPVs should prompt
further clinical investigation (when the patient is identified),
review of surveillance and polio vaccination coverage data, and
implementation of vaccination campaigns (mop-ups and SIAs, usually
with tOPV) to prevent virus spread.

Experience has underscored the importance of routine immunization
either with IPV or tOPV to prevent VDPV spread (10). In countries
with low rates of routine vaccination, closing the immunity gaps to
all three poliovirus serotypes by periodic but regular use of
trivalent OPV in SIAs is important. However, high rates of tOPV
coverage will not prevent or clear VDPV infections in immunodeficient
hosts. WHO, in collaboration with other partners, is exploring
antiviral compounds for their potential to clear iVDPV infections (3).

[This review provides a clear statement of the extent and types of
poliovirus variation still extant in the world at this juncture in
the global eradication campaign. It is apparent that cVDPs
(circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses) can persist indefinitely
in settings with low rates of poliovirus vaccination coverage.
Furthermore in countries with low rates of routine vaccination,
closing the immunity gaps to all three poliovirus serotypes by
periodic but regular use of trivalent OPV is important.

Improvements in laboratory methods are facilitating the early
detection of outbreaks and are further extending the analysis of
polioviruses excreted from immunodeficient individuals and the
increasing number of highly divergent aVDPVs (ambiguous
vaccine-derived polioviruses) found in the environment whose
importance has yet to be assessed. - Mod.CP]

[The persistence of cVDPV in areas with low vaccination coverages
raises the ever present discussion/controversy as to when is the
appropriate time for countries to consider switching to the use of a
killed virus vaccine (IPV). That being said, as long as there is
continued circulation of the wild poliovirus (WPV) in many countries,
a switch to IPV carries cost and logistic implications that mitigate
against making such a change. - Mod.MPP]
