According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 5 European countries have reported 147 people infected with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Agona, which could be linked to ready-to-eat food. In the UK, 129 people have been infected, while Finland counts 15 cases, Denmark 1, Germany 1 and Ireland 1.

Experts from EFSA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) believe that ready-to-eat products containing cucumbers and prepared in the UK may be the source of infection. As yet, they have been unable to identify the specific point in the production chain where contamination occurred. They have warned that new cases may occur until the source of infection and specific point of contamination are identified.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most people with salmonellosis develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12-72 hours after infection. Although most people recover without treatment, severe infections may occur, with infants, elderly people and those with impaired immune systems more at risk of developing severe illness.

[ProMED's 1st post in June 2018 on this outbreak reported that the strain had been circulating since 2014 but with most of the cases occurring since 2016. At that point, there were 115 cases in the UK with 53 occurring in 2018, now 14 more have occurred in the UK. ECDC is now reporting cucumbers as a vehicle, although if the outbreak has existed since 2014, repeated contaminations must have occurred. - Mod.LL
