Birds located near a wastewater treatment plant have lost their
ability to stay waterproof.
Hundreds of ducks have mysteriously died at Colorado's largest
wastewater treatment plant over the past month [January-February
2007].
A manager at a Longmont wildlife rehabilitation center, caring for
some surviving birds from the plant, believes a contaminant caused
the ducks' deaths and illnesses. The Colorado Division of Wildlife
and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, however, are still
investigating the cause.
"This is a really interesting case for all of us," said Gary Mowad, a
special agent in charge of the Mountain Prairie Region for the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service. "With this many labs looking at it, it is
unusual that we have not figured out why, and we are still getting
dead birds."
In mid-January [2007], employees at Metro Wastewater Reclamation
District began reporting an unusual amount of dead Northern Shovelers
and Gadwall ducks at the plant, said Steve Frank, spokesman for the
district.
Birds living in water tanks at the plant apparently lost their
ability to keep dry and froze to death, but nobody knows why, he
said. To date [15 Feb 2007], 478 ducks have died, Frank said.
Some dead ducks also were found at a Denver pond on the South Platte
River near the plant and at a wastewater treatment plant in
Northglenn. "We know that this is happening in other places that have
nothing to do with wastewater treatment," Frank said.
Plant employees also gathered 71 sick ducks and sent them to the
Greenwood Wildlife Rehabilitation Sanctuary in Colorado. Only 44
ducks lived, said Libby Osnes-Erie, an animal-care manager at the
rehab sanctuary.
Osnes-Erie wanted to send the ducks to California to be
rehabilitated. However, California wildlife officials won't allow the
ducks to be released there. Sending the birds back to Colorado would
be too expensive, so the animals will stay here [at the Greenwood
Sanctuary], Osnes-Erie said.
She postponed treating the ducks for several weeks, hoping tests from
state and federal wildlife officials would help her decide how to
help the animals.
Last week [week of 4 Feb 2007], she decided to stop waiting and began
washing the ducks. "Basically, they are not waterproof, and we think
they are getting a contaminant on their feathers," Osnes-Erie said.
She believes the contaminant in the wastewater is a surfactant, such
as soap or detergent. "It comes off fairly easily, but the ducks
cannot get it off themselves," Osnes-Erie said.
Frank disagreed. The ducks may have a contaminant on them, but it is
not soap from the plant, he said. "For her to call it surfactant, I
think, is more than she is able to say on the basis of any hard
science," Frank said. The water at the treatment plant contained
normal levels of soap byproducts, he said.
Colorado Division of Wildlife spokeswoman, Jennifer Churchill, also
said there is no scientific evidence to back up Osnes-Erie's claim,
though tests are still pending.
Wildlife scientists have ruled out avian flu and West Nile virus in
the case, but it is still unknown what caused the ducks to lose their
ability to waterproof, she said.
Meanwhile, Osnes-Erie may release some of the washed ducks this
weekend [17-18Feb 2007], after she receives clearance from the Fish
and Wildlife Service. Officials with the wildlife service say they
are confident the birds do not have communicable diseases.
But Osnes-Erie doesn't want to release them near the Metro Wastewater
plant, which she would be required to do. Instead, she is asking the
Division of Wildlife permission to release the birds at Valmont
Reservoir.
