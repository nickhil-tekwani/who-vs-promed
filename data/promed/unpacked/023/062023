Meningococcal disease in Sudan - update
----------------------------------------
As of 25 Mar 2005, 71 suspected cases including 5 deaths (case fatality
rate, 7.04 percent) have been reported from Sarf Omra, North Darfur state.
_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup W135 has been identified by either latex
test or culture in 11 out of 20 specimens collected.
A mass vaccination campaign using trivalent vaccine provided by the
International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic
Meningitis Control and targeting a population of 45 000 started on 2 Apr
2005 in the Sarf Omra administrative unit and surrounding villages.
Medecins sans Frontieres-Belgium and WHO have supported the Federal
Ministry of Health in implementing the campaign.

Meningococcal Disease, Africa
-------------------------------
According to the WHO, recent epidemics of meningococcal disease have been
reported in southwest Chad and North Darfur State, Sudan. In Chad,
laboratory testing has confirmed _Neisseria meningitidis_ A as the
predominate serogroup. In Sudan, approximately half the reported cases have
been laboratory-confirmed as _N. meningitidis_ W-135 serogroup.
Both countries are in an area of Africa where epidemics of meningococcal
meningitis are frequently reported (the meningitis belt). Peaks of
serogroup A meningococcal disease occur regularly in the region during the
dry season (Dec-Jun), with large-scale epidemics every 8-12 years. In 2002,
a major epidemic due to serogroup W-135 _N. meningitidis_ occurred in
Burkina Faso.
In response to the outbreak, WHO and other international agencies are
working with the Ministry of Health of both countries on mass immunization
campaigns. The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision
for Epidemic Meningitis Control will provide vaccine for the campaigns.
The CDC recommends that anyone traveling to the affected areas receive
meningococcal quadrivalent vaccine (A, C, Y, W-135), especially if
prolonged contact with the local population is likely. Vaccination is also
indicated during the dry season for travelers to other countries in the
meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa recognized as having epidemic
meningococcal disease caused by a vaccine-preventable serogroup (i.e., A,
C, Y, and W-135).
A quadrivalent polysaccharide vaccine has been available in the USA for
many years. The newly licensed quadrivalent conjugate vaccine is preferred,
although the unconjugated product is acceptable.
[The newly licensed quadrivalent polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine
should be a significant improvement over the older biologic since, as
T-cell-dependent antigens, the immunogens will be effective in children
less than 2 years old and can prime the immune system for boosters, neither
of which is the case with the older vaccine. Outer membrane protein
vesicle vaccines for type B are being studied. - Mod.LL]

Disease strikes visiting scientist
----------------------------------
A British scientist is critically ill and likely to lose limbs after
contracting meningococcal disease while studying the deadly illness in Porirua.
The woman, who was working in a laboratory run by crown research institute
ESR, is in a critical condition in Wellington Hospital, with blood
infection caused by the disease. It is understood that her legs and an arm
will be amputated but her condition is too unstable to allow surgery.
The woman -- who has been under intensive care for 2 weeks -- is one of 5
unrelated meningococcal disease cases reported in the Wellington region in
the past 2 weeks. A meningococcal B immunization campaign is due to begin
in the region next month.
ESR chief executive John Hay confirmed the patient was a visiting overseas
scientist working in a lab that handled meningococcal samples. The source
of infection was unknown but ESR was investigating.
Overseas expert Andrew Lawrence reviewed the lab's practices and reported
yesterday that there were no recorded accidents. He had no reason to assume
the disease was acquired in the lab.
Mr Hay said the woman scientist was experienced and had worked with many
strains of meningococcal disease before coming to work at the Kenepuru
Science Centre, where she was given full training. ESR has been researching
a New Zealand strain of meningococcal bacterium for about 15 years, and its
work formed the basis for producing the new vaccine.
Medical officer of Health Annette Nesdale said that, before the 5 latest
cases, there were just 2 in the first 3 months of the year. The latest
cases showed the meningococcal disease epidemic was far from over and
demonstrated the importance of immunization, she said.
All 5 patients had been admitted to hospital; 3 had already been discharged
and only the scientist remained in intensive care.
Wellington Hospital infectious diseases specialist Tim Blackmore said the
number of patients admitted with meningococcal disease in the past few
weeks was unusual, but the disease was generally more common in winter.
Health boards in the Wellington region are preparing to immunise more than
100 000 babies, children and teenagers starting May 2005. The first of 70
000 consent forms were sent this week to parents of children at Porirua
schools.

significantly endemic in the country); nor is it stated whether the
