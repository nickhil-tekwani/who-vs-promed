Noticeable numbers of fish are dying off at Buffalo Pound Lake [Saskatchewan]. But while the cause of the die-off is yet to be determined, Canadian Co-operative Wildlife Health Centre (CCWHC) regional director Trent Bollinger told the Times-Herald humans and their pets should not be in danger due to the ongoing situation.

"It's not a threat to people," he said on Tuesday [19 Jun 2012]. "This is a fish issue.

Most heavily impacted seems to be yellow perch, which Bollinger said are washing up along the shoreline of the local lake. This is the 2nd year in a row the local lake has experienced a fish die-off event, and researchers are taking samples, testing, and trying to diagnose the cause.

"It looks like there's a couple of different things," Bollinger said, adding the likely culprit is a bacterial organism causing columnaris disease. "This is a bacterial disease that impacts a range of fish species."

Sampled fish at the lake have lesions, and cultured samples suggest columnaris is the likely cause of death.

Columnaris disease is caused by _Flavobacterium columnare_, a Gram negative bacterium. It affects freshwater fish worldwide. Stress and pollutants in water can affect the severity of _F. columnare_ infections in fish, so it is pertinent to look at an underlying cause.
