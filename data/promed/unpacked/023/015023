Albania planned to cull and bury nearly 2000
chickens in the southern Sarande area on Thursday
[9 Mar 2006] after a chicken was found to have
died from the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu,
officials said.
Albania's first case of the virus was confirmed
on Wednesday [8 Mar 2006]. It was found 20 km (12
miles) north of the border with Greece, close to
the Butrint lagoon, a known resting ground for
migratory birds.
Veterinary teams clad in white protective suits
swooped in on the area, wringing the necks of
fluttering chickens, then putting them in black
garbage bags. One vet said they shoved live
chickens in the bags to suffocate them.
"The villagers themselves are bringing their
chickens in plastic bags," Agriculture Ministry
spokesman Rexhep Shahu told Reuters. "We are
culling them as a preventive measure and we will
be monitoring the situation for 30 days."
Some villagers asked to keep their backyard
poultry. "Let me eat it, I don't care if I do
die," said one elderly lady.
"The Minister has been saying it's safe to eat,
so we have eaten them," added a man. "We didn't
eat the last 4 we had left because we're
observing Lent (for Orthodox Easter)".
Villagers were to get 700 leks (6.80 USD) for a
grown chicken and 400 leks (3.90 USD) for a
chick. Medical teams took blood samples to see if
any villagers were infected.
The bird flu virus has spread rapidly since the
beginning of February 2006, and is now present in
most European countries. It has infected 176
people worldwide, killing 96 since 2003.
Scientists fear it is only a matter of time
before it mutates into a form that passes easily
among people, triggering a pandemic.

[2] Germany, stone marten: WHO update
Date: Fri, 10 Mar 2006
From: Marianne Hopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com>

<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_03_09a/en/index.html>

Officials in Germany have today confirmed H5N1
infection in a 2nd mammalian species, the stone
marten. This finding marks the first documented
infection of this species with an avian influenza
virus. Previously, H5N1 infection was confirmed
in Germany in 3 domestic cats.
The marten was found alive, but showing signs of
severe illness, on the Baltic island of Ruegen on
2 Mar 2006. The animal was euthanized. Tests
conducted at Germany's
Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut for Animal Health
confirmed infection with the H5N1 avian influenza
virus.
The ill animal was found in the same heavily
affected area of the island, near Schaprode, as 3
dead domestic cats. Tests conducted at the
Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut subsequently
confirmed that all 3 cats were infected with the
highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. The stone marten is
a predatory nocturnal mammal with feeding habits
similar to those of domestic cats. As with the
cats found on Ruegen island, the marten is
presumed to have acquired its infection after
feeding on an infected bird.
Since 16 Feb 2006, German authorities have
confirmed H5N1 infection in 125 wild swans,
ducks, geese, and birds of prey on Ruegen Island,
pointing to considerable opportunities for
exposures in small mammals that feed on birds.
As is the case with humans, infections in animal
species other than birds are rare. To date, only
domestic poultry are known to have played a role
in the transmission cycle of the virus from
animals to humans.
In July 2005, tests on 3 rare Owston's palm
civets that died in captivity in Viet Nam
detected H5N1 infection, marking the first known
infection in this mammalian species [see
20051029.3160]. Large cats, including tigers and
leopards, kept in [captivity] and fed on infected
poultry carcasses, have also been infected and
developed severe disease. Ferrets are another
mammalian species known to be susceptible to
infection.
Further investigation is needed to determine
whether evidence of H5N1 infection in new
mammalian species has any significance for the
risk of human infection or the potential of this
virus to adapt to mammals, including humans.

[The above WHO update adds some
clinico-epidemiological information to the
initial posting on the infected stone marten. In
a separate Reuters' newswire, it was indicated
that the animal was caught alive and later put
down. In Germany, as elsewhere, those engaged in
wildlife protection and conservation are
instructed to apply the required precautionary
measures when handling the captured/treated
animals, to avoid risk of infection. Defra's
Protocol for the collection and submission of
samples, including public health advice, might
serve as a useful guideline:

[3] H5N1, Stone marten: environmental impact
Date: Fri, 10 Mar 2006
From: Mark Pokras <mark.pokras@tufts.edu>

Mustelids and influenza
-----------------------
Domestic ferrets are well-known to be extremely
sensitive to human influenza viruses both as pets
and in laboratory settings.
I wonder what effects this may have on
populations of small mammalian predators and the
potential for subsequent population explosions of
rodents (and their pathogens) in the next year or
two?

[4] China, subclinical infection: chickens, ducks and geese
Date: Fri, 10 Mar 2006

Up to one percent of apparently healthy chickens,
ducks and geese in wet markets in southern China
are infected with the deadly H5N1 avian flu
virus, researchers in Hong Kong and China have
found.
The finding shows people may be far more exposed
to the virus than previously thought, and the
fight against the virus, which experts fear will
unleash a pandemic, may be more difficult, as it
will be harder to detect without obvious signs of
disease.
Although waterfowl are natural hosts of the H5N1,
this is the first time researchers have found and
documented on such a large scale infected
chickens which do not show signs of the disease.
Chickens usually die within 24 hours of being
infected.
Led by microbiologist Guan Yi from the University
of Hong Kong, researchers collected 51 121 faecal
and other samples from healthy-looking birds in
live-poultry markets across 7 provinces in
southern China from January 2004 to June 2005.
The H5N1 virus was found in 1.8 percent of ducks,
1.9 percent of geese, 0.46 percent of minor
poultry like pheasants and quail, and 0.26
percent of chickens.
"This means out of every 100 birds in wet
markets, one is positive and infected with the
virus. They look healthy but they can infect
others and they can kill people," Guan told
Reuters on Friday [10 Mar 2006].
The study was published in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences in late February
2006.
It was Guan's first extensive interview with the
media after he was heavily criticised by Chinese
newspapers in December 2005 for remarks he made
regarding the bird flu problem in China.
"Ducks, geese and chickens can breed the virus in
poultry markets, they shed the virus in their
faeces into the environment and people get
exposed to the virus," Guan said.
Home to the world's biggest population of
chickens, China pledged in 2005 to vaccinate all
of them. While considered a valiant bid to get
rid of the virus, experts say that is impossible
because millions of China's backyard chickens
roam free.
It began vaccinating its farmed poultry a few
years ago, but the [spread of the avian
influenza] virus has not abated since it was
first isolated in a goose in China's southern
Guangdong province in 1996.
The virus has spread to at least 14 Chinese
provinces and regions in the past year. Strains
of the virus now found in other parts of Asia,
Europe and the Middle East can all be traced back
to China -- raising doubts about the quality of
the China-made vaccines.
"The vaccines in China can only keep birds alive,
save their lives, but cannot stop the virus from
replicating or infecting other birds," said a
source familiar with the situation in China.

[In posting 20051029.3160, we presented a
chronological list summarising the main
animal-health related events since the beginning
of the H5N1 panzootic and the relevant research
covering the period from 1996 ("Highly pathogenic
H5N1 virus is isolated from a farmed goose in
Guangdong Province, China") to 26 Oct 2005
("Croatia confirms H5N1 in wild birds"). The list
was copied, with some editorial modifications,
from the WHO influenza home page. It included 47
updates. We hereby copy the continuation of the
said time-line list, covering the subsequent 21
updates up to the last available one, dated 3 Mar
2006, and one research paper of significance,
published during the covered period. - Mod.AS]

Research:
Chen H et al. Establishment of multiple
sublineages of H5N1 influenza virus in Asia:
implications for pandemic control. Proc Natl Acad
Sci USA 2006; 103: 2845�2850.
Studies of H5N1 viruses show that multiple
genetically and antigenically distinct
sublineages of the virus are now established in
poultry in parts of Asia. Poultry-to-poultry
transmission is thought to sustain endemicity of
the virus in this region. H5N1 virus is isolated
from apparently healthy migratory birds in
southern China, suggesting that migratory birds
can carry the virus over long distances.
