Additional cases of hepatitis C
-------------------------------
Another 4 patients tested positive for the same strain of hepatitis C [virus] that has been connected to Exeter Hospital's cardiac catheterization lab and recovery area. The state Department of Health and Human Services announced the 4 additional cases on Thu 12 Jul 2012 bringing the total number of people infected to 31, which includes one hospital employee.

The state estimates that there are still about 50 patients that received treatment at the hospital's cardiac catheterization lab and recovery area since October 2010 that still need to be tested. "The testing is continuing and will until we feel sure that we have not missed any possible exposures of patients related to this outbreak," said Dr. Jose Montero, director of public health at the DHHS, in a released statement Thursday. He added that based on the latest results, the state sees no reason to change the timeline -- 01 Oct 2010 to 25 May 2012 -- for testing that they've been using. The earliest date of infection to date is June 2011 and the latest is May 2012.

In addition to the 31 cases related to the hospital's outbreak, 12 other people have tested positive for a strain of hepatitis C that doesn't appear related to the hospital's strain, according to Montero. However, those samples have been sent to the Centers for Disease Control with the other positive results for additional testing.

Montero previously said that the state's investigation into the outbreak wouldn't be complete until the testing for the virus is complete and he's sure that he has interviewed everyone who has been infected with the virus. State health officials have said the likely cause of the outbreak is an infected hospital employee abusing drugs by self-injecting with syringes -- possibly in the middle of patient procedures -- then returning the syringes to be used on patients.

The state attorney general and U.S. attorney's office have launched a criminal probe into the outbreak. The federal probe also involves the FBI. Officials at the U.S. attorney's office said the case is still under investigation but didn't provide any further comment. To date, about 2 dozen lawsuits have been filed against the hospital by those infected with hepatitis C or were subjected to hepatitis C, including a potential class action lawsuit that was filed at Rockingham Superior Court that includes almost 80 people.

Those still in need of testing can schedule an appointment through Exeter Hospital's information and referral center. If patients prefer, additional testing sites have been set up in Hampton and Portsmouth.

[The precise circumstances whereby the patients attending the Exeter Hospital's cardiac catheterization lab and recovery area were exposed to infection remains unexplained, other than that recycled syringes were involved. A single employee has been implicated, but it seems likely that there may have been a breach of disease security procedures -- how did the contaminated syringes come to be re-used?

It is likely that more cases of hepatitis C virus infection will be identified. Diagnosis of acute infection is often missed because the infected person has no symptoms. Common methods of antibody detection cannot differentiate between acute and chronic infection. The presence of antibodies against HCV (anti-HCV) indicates that a person is or has been infected. HCV recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) and HCV RNA testing are used to confirm the diagnosis of HCV infection.

Following initial infection, about 80 per cent of people exhibit no symptoms. Those people who are acutely symptomatic may exhibit fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-coloured faeces, joint pain, and jaundice (yellowing of skin and the whites of the eyes). When a chronically infected person develops symptoms, it may indicate advanced liver disease. Statistically, 60-70 per cent of those with chronic infection develop chronic liver disease, 5-20 per cent develop cirrhosis, and 1-5 per cent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer.
