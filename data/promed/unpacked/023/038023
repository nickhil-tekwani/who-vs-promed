Silent Poliovirus Carrier Highlights Previously Unrecognized Risk
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Health experts have uncovered a case of a European man who is
carrying poliovirus but has not developed the disease, even though
his immune system is weak. Doctors cannot explain why the man is not
seriously ill and wonder if the polio virus could be changing. They
say the case proves that there is no room for complacency over the
continuing need for vaccination programmes, even though the disease
has officially been eradicated in Europe. Doctors stress the man they
now call "Polio Man" is not a serious health hazard. However, he is
key to understanding how to deal with what virologists term "the end
game" of polio vaccination programmes: when polio vaccination
programmes can be ended safely.
Polio Man is immunodeficient, but doctors are extremely surprised
that he has not developed paralysis or any form of the disease.
Paralysis usually occurs in just one in 100 cases of polio infection,
but it nearly always occurs when the person has a weakened immune
system. Although people with mild cases of polio can also spread the
disease, Polio Man shows that the polio virus may be changing and is
no longer following the usual path of infection. Dr Philip Minor,
Head of Virology at the National Institute for Biological Standards
and Control, said: "Although there is no official record that anyone
has caught polio from him, it is a possibility. We find this a very
interesting case. Unvaccinated children could be at risk of
contracting polio if their mothers have not passed on antibodies to
their children. The man is not likely to be in contact with small
children. But this is why vaccination programmes are important.
People who are vaccinated are not at risk."
The World Health Organisation (WHO) officially stated on 21 Jun 2002
that polio has been eradicated in Europe, following its eradication
earlier in the Americas and Western Pacific. The disease is said to
be eradicated when no cases are recorded for 3 years. However, health
experts are debating how polio can remain eradicated worldwide and
when vaccination programmes can stop altogether.
Polio Man is in his late 20s, has never suffered from poliomyelitis
and was vaccinated against the disease. He is suffering from chronic
immunodeficiency and chronic gut problems such as diarrhoea, which is
common in such patients. Doctors were alerted to his case in 1995
when conducting a study into gastric problems associated with
immunodeficiency. One test during the study involved analysis of the
man's faeces and this revealed the presence of poliovirus. In 99
percent of polio cases, the disease remains dormant and the person
does not become ill. However, in the immunodepressed, polio diseases
can be activated. In 99 percent of people, the polio virus can be
carried, but it does not enter the bloodstream to cause disease. It
is only when their immune system is compromised, as in AIDS, that the
polio virus enters the bloodstream and causes disease. Dr Minor and
his colleagues at NIBSC are currently writing a scientific paper on
the patient, to be sent for publication in a medical journal later
this year.

[The existence of this case, as well as several similar ones in other
regions, has been confirmed by an independent source. This is an
alarming observation, especially with regard to the poliomyelitis
eradication status of Europe. Such cases, although rare, show that
polio immunizations must be continued for the foreseeable future.
The report leaves unresolved the question of the relative roles of
genetic change in the (presumably attenuated) poliovirus genome and
the partial immunodeficiency of the patient in determining carrier
status. - Mods.CP & LM]
