Of Malaysia's 13 states, 3 recorded a sharp increase in the number of
cases and deaths caused by the mosquito-borne dengue fever [virus]
this year [2009], news reports said Sunday [25 Jan 2009]. Central
Selangor state, with the highest number of cases, combined with the
northern states of Penang and Kedah to make up 71 percent of the
total 4221 cases, and 12 fatalities have been recorded nationwide
since 1 Jan [2009], the Star daily reported.

The figures were almost triple the 1514 cases and 4 deaths recorded
in the same period last year [2008].

"I hope everyone will cooperate with us to get the situation under
control," said Health Minister Liow Tiong Lai.

On Monday [19 Jan 2009], Malaysia's health ministry raised a health
alert following the increase in dengue cases, calling local councils
and the public to work together.

The symptoms of dengue, [the virus of] which is carried by the
_Aedes_ mosquito, include high fever, rashes, headaches, and muscle
and joint pain. If not detected and treated early, the disease can be
fatal.

The government has been holding campaigns to educate the public as
well as conduct checks for mosquito-breeding sites on residential and
construction sites to try to stem dengue cases.

Despite the efforts, the number of cases and deaths continues to rise
each year.

Dengue fever cases in north Queensland climbed above 200 yesterday
[22 Jan 2009] amid fears the disease carrying mosquitoes may be
resistant to pesticides.

Cairns-based insect expert Scott Ritchie said Queensland Health was
looking at alternative pesticides to address what has been described
as the state's worst dengue outbreak since before World War II.

"We are concerned that a minority of residents do not perceive the
public health risk associated with neglecting mozzie [mosquito]
breeding on their property," Dr Ritchie said.

"Dengue mosquitoes [_Aedes aegypti_] are extremely adept at finding
water in a wide variety of containers. They are secretive, indoor,
daytime biters. Even one or 2 mosquitoes in a house is enough to
maintain the transmission cycle."

In Cairns, where 13 suburbs have been affected, 190 dengue fever
cases have been confirmed, while in Townsville, 20 people have been
infected.

Despite scientists expressing concern the dengue mosquito could
easily reestablish itself in the state's southeast, Lord Mayor
Campbell Newman said studies had revealed no sign of the blood
suckers in Brisbane.

The Red Cross has issued an urgent call for blood donors because the
dengue fever outbreak in north Queensland has robbed them of 14
percent of their regular supply.

The Australian Red Cross Blood Service (ARCBS) Queensland medical
services manager Dr Matt Lee-Archer said the service asked donors who
had recently recovered from dengue or who had traveled to
dengue-affected areas to wait another 4 weeks before donating whole
blood.

At the moment, this includes Cairns and Townsville, which between
them contribute one in 7 Queensland donors.

ARCBS expects the safety measure will cause a shortage of donors for
at least the next 4 months.

Three north Queensland blood donor centres are now affected by the
dengue fever outbreaks, ARCBS Queensland Operations Manager Anthony
Bourke said last week.

"Without the support of other Queensland regions, this has the
potential to be devastating to our future stock levels, and support
from the remainder of the state is required for the next 4 months,"
he said.

Dr Lee-Archer encouraged those affected by restrictions to continue
to give platelets, which are involved in the clotting of blood, and
resume whole bloods after 4 weeks.

"People in the affected areas can still give platelets, and it's
really important that they do," he said.

The donated platelets are used to restore platelet levels in those
undergoing chemotherapy and only have a shelf-life of 5 days.

The restrictions were put in place when a dengue outbreak occurred
Cairns on 1 Dec of last year [2008] and Townsville in early January
this year [2009].

Dr Lee-Archer said dengue fever could be transmitted via blood
transfusions, and the current restrictions were introduced because no
large scale screening test for the virus is licensed for Australia.

"That's why its important that more people know about the (blood
supply) shortage and donate," he said.

An ARCBS spokeswoman said the restrictions would be lifted 4 months
after the last recorded case in the dengue outbreak but noted that
more cases were expected in the current outbreak.

Close to 43 dengue cases have been reported in the Northern Division
following the recent flash floods, the new interim Health Minister,
Dr Neil Sharma, confirmed.

Dr Sharma told Fijilive that the majority of the cases have been
reported in the Macuata and Cakaudrove provinces.

"We are advising people nationwide to boil all sources of drinking
water and to get rid of containers that have stored water, as it is a
mosquito breeding zone," he said.

Dr Sharma said people should also protect themselves from mosquito bites.

"There has been no major outbreak reported in the Western Division;
however, we are concerned about water contamination," he said.

Bolivian health authorities have detected a dengue outbreak in an
area near the border with Argentina and today [20 Jan 2009] revealed
the death of a 3rd DHF victim this week [week of 18 Jan 2009].

The classical dengue outbreak was detected in the area of Yacuiba on
the border with Argentina in the southern department [state or
province equivalent - Mod.TY] of Tarija, and it is suspected that it
could affect around 200 people, according to the television chain ATB.

Bolivia has found itself in a "health emergency" due to the dengue
epidemic, the disease [virus] being transmitted by the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito, which is abundant in tropical areas and is
especially reproductively active during the rainy season.

DHF today [20 Jan 2009] took the life of its 3rd victim of the week
in Bolivia with the death of a child of 11 years, reported Alfredo
Rodriguez, chief of intensive therapy of the Hospital del Nino
[Children's Hospital] in La Paz.

"Unfortunately, we could not save him. He arrived in a comatose state
with a hemorrhagic syndrome, bleeding from his skin, intestines and
stomach," the physician said.

Just in the Sant Cruz region, there are now 1350 suspected cases
according to the Director of Epidemiology of the department, Roberto
Torrez.

The other main [dengue] outbreaks are in the areas of central
Cochabamba, the tropical zones of La Paz [department], and in the
city of Riberalta, in the Beni region (northeast Bolivia).

Juiz de Fora is on alert to combat the dengue [virus vector]
mosquito. The city government announced Wednesday [21 Jan 2009] the
results of a study done 5-12 [Jan 2009] that showed that 2.75 percent
of the buildings surveyed had larvae of the mosquito [_Aedes
aegypti_]. In October 2008 the figure was 0.63 percent.

According to the Municipal Health Secretariat, in 2008, only 417
[dengue] cases were registered in the city [including one death from
DHF].

For the World Health Organization (WHO), any rate [of _Ae. aegypti_
household infestation] that is above one percent is considered
alarming. Among the 191 districts of the city, 83 have [dengue]
outbreaks. The situation is worse in the north and east. In some of
these locations, the [household index] exceeded 7 percent. The WHO
considers that there is epidemic risk where the household index is
over 4 percent.

The mayor, Custodio Mattos, reported that the necessary actions are
being taken jointly involving all spheres of public authority to
resolve the [mosquito vector] problem. "The rate of infestation is
extremely high in some places and very high in the city as a whole.
The risk of an epidemic is very great, and we have to unite to combat
dengue," he said.

Custodio said that an effort will be made between all the municipal
secretariats so that in a month, 80 000 buildings in the city will be
surveyed. As the Department of Health does not have sufficient staff
to go to all the sites, survey staff from other agencies will help to
accomplish the work. Besides them, the fire department is pledged to
help with visits. It is proposed to raise a contingent of 500 people.

The mayor called for the involvement of the population. "We are
facing a difficult enemy to fight. If people do not help by reporting
and participating, our work could have 1000 people and yet not go
ahead," he said.

The Municipal Health Secretariat confirmed on Wednesday [14 Jan 2009]
that there were 2 cases of dengue in the capital of Sao Paulo. The
patients are residents of Sacoma in the eastern zone and Campo Limpo
in the southern zone and contracted the disease [virus infection] in
December 2008. Previously, the last case of dengue had been registered
on 12 June of the past year [2008]. In 2007, there were 2624 [dengue
cases].

According to the Secretariat of Health, the actions to combat the
vector mosquito have been intensified in these 2 regions of the city.
