Re-emerging malaria transmission in Siberia?
---------------------------------------
The city of Krasnoyarsk is threatened by a malaria epidemic (in the first 6
months of 2000, 16 cases of malaria including 2 of tropical [sic malaria).
Main spots where mosquitos breed include 6 bodies of water: Peschanka, the
Yenisey river basin in the area of Prospekt Ulyanovskogo, the area of
Ulitsa Reydovoy, and near the kindergartens of the BSMP, and the Abakan
protoka.

[Malaria, primarily _P. vivax_, was endemic in the USSR until 1960. The
incidence was 43 cases per 10 000 population in 1950, and Krasnoyarsk is
within the previous area of endemicity. The cases need to be thoroughly
investigated to determine whether the outbreak is due to migration of
people from an endemic area or whether this is a genuine emergence of
autochthonous malaria. If a true emergence of local transmission is being
established the local authorities need to quickly establish a control
programme integrating treatment of cases and tracing of gametocyte carriers
with measures against the mosquito vector. A comment from the local
authorities is much needed. - Mod.EP
