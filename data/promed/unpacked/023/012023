The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) and Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) Saturday [29 Aug 2020] confirmed this year's [2020] 1st positive detection of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a mammal.

DEM's Division of Law Enforcement (DLE) responded to a report of a white-tailed deer -- disoriented and walking in circles -- in North Kingstown on 21 Aug 2020. DLE euthanized the animal, and its tissues were subsequently tested for EEE by RIDOH's Rhode Island State Health Laboratories. The state lab confirmed the deer tested positive for EEE. The animal also will be tested for chronic wasting disease. This finding of EEE in a mammal indicates there is now an elevated risk of disease transmission from mosquito bites to humans in Rhode Island.

DEM and RIDOH announced 147 mosquito samples from 44 traps set 17 Aug 2020 tested negative for both EEE and West Nile virus (WNV). Along with today's confirmed mammalian case, there has been one EEE finding in a mosquito sample from Westerly, announced 21 Aug 2020, and no findings of WNV in mosquito samples.

To date [30 Aug 2020], Massachusetts has confirmed 3 human cases of EEE, 65 findings of EEE, and 70 findings of WNV. There have been no human cases of EEE or WNV in Connecticut in 2020, but the state has confirmed 2 EEE findings and 82 WNV findings.

Personal protection is the 1st line of defense against mosquitoes carrying WNV, EEE, or other diseases -- and the most effective way to avoid infection. With EEE established in Rhode Island and WNV nearby, DEM and RIDOH remind the public to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds around their homes and yards and prevent being bitten, whenever possible. While outdoor spaces reduce the likelihood of exposure to COVID-19, they pose a greater risk of exposure to mosquito-borne diseases. For this reason, DEM and RIDOH emphasize if Rhode Islanders are going to be outside during the peak "biting hours" -- at dawn and dusk -- to wear your face masks, long sleeves and pants, and use insect repellent. The following precautions are advised.

Protect yourself:
- Put screens on windows and doors. Fix screens having holes or loose screens.
- At sunrise and sundown (when mosquitoes carrying EEE are most active), consider rescheduling outdoor activities occurring during evening or early morning. If you must be outside, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants and use bug spray.
- Use EPA-approved bug spray with one of the following active ingredients: DEET (20%-30% strength); picaridin, IR3535; and oil of lemon eucalyptus or paramenthane. Always read the label and follow all directions and precautions.
- Do not use bug spray with DEET on infants under 2 months of age. Children should be careful not to rub their eyes after bug spray has been applied on their skin. Wash children's hands with soap and water to remove any bug spray when they return indoors.
- Put mosquito netting over playpens and baby carriages.
- Get rid of mosquito breeding grounds.
- Get rid of anything around your house and yard collecting water. Just one cup of water can produce hundreds of mosquitoes; an unused tire containing water can produce thousands of mosquitoes.
- Clean your gutters and downspouts so they can drain properly.
- Remove any water from unused swimming pools, wading pools, boats, planters, trash and recycling bins, tires, and anything else collecting water, and cover them.
- Remove or treat any shallow water accumulating on top of a pool cover. Larvicide treatments, such as Mosquito Dunks, can be applied to kill immature mosquitoes. This environmentally friendly product is available at many hardware and garden stores and online.
- Change the water in birdbaths at least 2 times a week and rinse out birdbaths once a week.

Best practices for horse owners:
Horses are particularly susceptible to WNV and EEE. Horse owners are advised to vaccinate their animals early in the season and practice the following:
- Remove or cover areas where standing water can collect.
- Avoid putting animals outside at dawn, dusk, or during the night when mosquitoes are most active.
- Insect-proof facilities where possible and use approved [for the species] repellents frequently.
- Monitor animals for signs of fever and/or neurological signs (such as stumbling, moodiness, loss of appetite), and report all suspicious cases to a veterinarian immediately. If you are unsure if your horse is properly vaccinated, you should consult with your veterinarian.

The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) confirmed Tuesday [1 Sep 2020] Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) was found in 2 horses in Newaygo County.

According to the state's weekly summary of arbovirus activity (https://www.michigan.gov/documents/emergingdiseases/Weekly_Arbovirus_Summary_698895_7.pdf), EEE has been reported in 10 horses across 4 counties: 3 in Clare County, 1 in Kent County, 4 in Montcalm County, and the 2 horses in Newaygo County.

In 2019, Michigan experienced its largest ever outbreak of EEE. Ten Michigan residents were infected: 1 in Barry County, 2 in Berrien County, 1 in Calhoun County, 2 in Cass County, 3 in Kalamazoo County, and 1 in Van Buren County. There were 6 deaths. The state said 50 EEE-positive animals were also reported.

EEE is a viral disease, transmitted by mosquitoes to both animals and people. EEE is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the USA, and the virus is typically seen in late summer to early fall each year in Michigan. While horses are highly affected by the disease, people can also be infected with EEE from the bite of a mosquito carrying the virus.

In humans, signs of EEE include the sudden onset of fever, chills, and body and joint aches. EEE infection can develop into severe encephalitis, resulting in headache, disorientation, tremors, seizures and paralysis. Permanent brain damage, coma and death may also occur in some cases.

To protect your horses and other domestic animals (such as dogs, sheep and goats), the department recommends:
- Talking to a veterinarian about vaccinating horses against EEE.
- Placing livestock in a barn under fans (as mosquitoes are not strong flyers) during peak mosquito activity from dusk to dawn.
- Using an insect repellent approved for the species on the animals.
- Eliminating standing water on the property -- i.e., fill in puddles, repair eaves, and change the water in buckets and bowls at least once a day. [And old tires hold water for mosquito breeding. - Mod.TG]
- Contacting a veterinarian if an animal shows signs of the illness: fever and stumbling, which can progress to being down and struggling to stand.

To protect yourself and your family, here's what the health department provided:
- Apply insect repellents containing the active ingredient DEET, or other US Environmental Protection Agency-approved products, to exposed skin or clothing and always follow the manufacturer's directions for use.
- Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to clothing to help prevent bites.
- Maintain window and door screening to help keep mosquitoes outside.
- Empty water from mosquito breeding sites around the home, such as buckets, unused children's pools, old tires, or similar sites where mosquitoes may lay eggs.
- Use nets and/or fans over outdoor eating areas. Overall, mosquito-borne illnesses, like EEE, will continue to pose a risk to both animals and humans until late fall when nighttime temperatures consistently fall below freezing.
- A sanitarian for DHD no. 10 is currently performing mosquito trapping in Newaygo and Oceana counties to determine if there are mosquitos found with EEE.

Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) officials received notification of a confirmed Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) case on 26 Aug 2020. The affected equine, an unvaccinated pony in the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville, Ontario, showed neurologic signs and was subsequently euthanized.

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the Eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the USA.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include:
- Avoid mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn.
- Look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol).
- Apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite.
- Mosquito-proof homes: Fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.
- Protect your horses: Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the USA. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year [2020] to vaccinate your horses.
- Use approved insect repellents to protect horses.
- If possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
- Eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly.
- Stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance), or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis_ [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

[The 1st article is interesting because it involves a deer. The article does not tell us if the deer was wild or captive raised, nor is there any indication why the officials elected to test it for EEE. I would expect them to test the deer for chronic wasting disease (CWD) and perhaps for one or more of the hemorrhagic diseases. This article also includes a paragraph about Massachusetts, indicating perhaps Rhode Island tends to follow the Massachusetts trends in mosquito diseases.

Eastern equine encephalitis is preventable. The vaccine for EEE is usually combined with some other mosquito-borne diseases, such as West Nile virus (WNV) and Western equine encephalitis (WEE). These vaccines usually have tetanus included, hence a lot of protection for the dollars spent. The vaccine is a series of 2-3 vaccines given 3-4 weeks apart.

EEE protection wanes the fastest, and in areas where the prevalence of the disease is high, horse owners are encouraged to revaccinate approximately every 3-4 months for best protection. If you have not already vaccinated your horse, please take immediate steps to get the animal(s) vaccinated. It may well save their life. - Mod.TG
