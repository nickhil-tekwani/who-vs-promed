Virus confirmed from Rawalpindi
-------------------------------
A 2nd case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) from Rawalpindi was confirmed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) on Wednesday [3 Feb 2012]. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned against the increase in CCHF cases this year if precautionary measures are not taken before Eidul Azha.

This year, 38 confirmed cases of CCHF have been reported from across the country and more are expected after Eidul Azha, according to the WHO. Out of these 38 cases, 14 deaths have been reported so far. This is the 1st time in 8 years that there has been such an increase in the number of CCHF cases in the country. According to the NIH, the case is from Choa Saidan Shah in Chakwal district from where a previous CCHF case was reported which resulted in the patient's death.

The 45-year-old victim was brought to the Holy Family Hospital (HFH) Rawalpindi on 27 Sep 2012 with high-grade fever. His test samples were sent to the NIH where it was confirmed that he was infected with the deadly disease.

Talking to The Express Tribune, HFH Deputy Medical Superintendent (DMS) Dr Javed Hayat said the latest patient is a butcher and is also associated with the leather business. He said his condition was stable and he would soon be discharged. A 65-year-old doctor, who had been brought earlier to the HFH, failed to survive because of massive blood loss. He was also associated with the leather business.

Talking to The Express Tribune, WHO Focal Person for Vector Control, Dr Qutbuddin Kakar said there were chances of an increase in CCHF cases in the country, particularly in high-risk areas, if precautionary measures were not taken to deal with the influx of sacrificial animals in urban areas. Animals from endemic areas like Balochistan should be properly de-ticked before they are moved to from one place to other.

"Considering the recent situation of CCHF cases in Pakistan, we are expecting more cases after Eid ul Azha," he said. Currently, lack of awareness is a major hurdle in combating the disease, Dr Kakar added. People should take precautionary measures while slaughtering sacrificial animals like wearing gloves, properly covering their face, especially eyes and mouth. Those who come into contact with newly-skinned animal hides should also take safety measures.

Patients infected with the virus should be quarantined to prevent its spread through their secretions.

[The virus which causes CCHF belongs to the genus _Nairovirus_, one of the 5 genera comprising the family _Bunyaviridae_. All of the 32 members of the genus _Nairovirus_ are transmitted by argasid or ixodid ticks. Humans who become infected with CCHF acquire the virus from direct contact with blood or other infected tissues from livestock during this time, or they may become infected from a tick bite. The majority of cases have occurred in those involved with the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians, or in this particular case participants in the leatherwork industry. It is understandable that the health authorities are concerned that there may may be an increase the incidence of human cases CCHFF during the festival of Eid ul Azha (Fri 26 Oct 2012 in Pakistan) when large numbers of domestic animals are sacrificed by the shedding of blood.
