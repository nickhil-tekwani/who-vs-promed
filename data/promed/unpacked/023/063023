Edmonton: 29 separate outbreaks of Norwalk virus in 2 months
------------------------------------------------------------
There's no end in sight to the biggest outbreak of a [Norwalk]-like virus
[infection] the city has ever seen, said medical officer of health Dr Gerry
Predy. He said more than 750 people have been affected in the past 2 months
in 29 separate outbreaks of the highly contagious Norwalk virus. But
because cases are only recorded when 2 or more people in an isolated area
get the virus, he said the figures represent the tip of the iceberg. "It's
a very contagious illness and once it gets into a closed population it's
very hard to control," said Predy. "I don't think we have ever documented
this many outbreaks. It's a concern."
Predy said there were only 10 outbreaks in Edmonton during the whole of
winter 2001-2002. But since the beginning of November 2002 there have been
29 separate outbreaks in daycare [facilities], schools, and seniors
residences. In the past week alone, 5 outbreaks at a school, 2 at
continuing care centers, and 2 at seniors' lodges have made 110 people ill.
Symptoms usually only last 24 to 48 hours and require no special treatment.
But for people with pre-existing health problems, the virus can be
extremely debilitating and require hospital treatment.
Because it is highly infectious, health officials are anxious to keep it
out of hospitals. An emergency ward at Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital was
shut down by an outbreak last week, but Predy said there have been no
reported outbreaks in Edmonton hospitals. "This has been ongoing since last
winter, but it's just got worse," said Predy. "When it's affecting so many
people it's hard to stop the spread of the virus."

[Perhaps the most significant aspect of these outbreaks in Edmonton is
that, unlike urban areas elsewhere in Canada (and in Europe, but apparently
not in the USA), hospitals appear to have remained free of infection. - Mod.CP]
