Anthrax, a highly infectious disease, has killed 5 people in a
tribal-dominated district of Orissa, while 5 more cases have been
reported from Andhra Pradesh, health officials said here.

"Five people died of anthrax in the Koraput district of Orissa. We
have also received information that 5 anthrax cases have been
reported from Nellore area in Andhra Pradesh," Shiv Lal, director of
National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), told reporters
Wednesday [6 Feb 2008]. He, however, said the outbreak of the
disease, which is caused by the spore-forming bacterium _Bacillus
anthracis_ that is commonly seen among cattle, sheep, goats and
antelopes, was not connected with bird-flu, which has created havoc
in West Bengal. Anthrax occurs in humans when they are exposed to
infected animals or tissue from infected animals.

Lal said an NICD team would be leaving for Orissa Thursday [7 Feb
2008] to assess the situation. "Both these areas are endemic areas,
and earlier, also, anthrax cases have been reported from there," he added.

Lal said the people in Orissa were infected with the bacterial
infection because they ate contaminated meat, while in Andhra
Pradesh, people handled infected animals.

[This report has originated at some distance from the areas affected,
and, therefore, comments as to actual lesions and causes of death
should be treated with caution. We await news of the results of the
NCID investigation due to start at the end of this week in Orissa. So
far, it would seem that the Orissa cases died from the gastro-enteric
form of the disease -- the earlier report had them eating "rotten"
meat or stale beef -- while the Andhra Pradesh cases are cutaneous. - Mod.MHJ]
