Youth dies mysterious disease
-------------------------
A 26-year-old young man who had recently come from South Africa died of a
mysterious disease here at the ICU of a local hospital on Sunday.
Sources suspect that the patient, who had been admitted at a private
hospital some 7 days ago, died of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS), the newly-emerged epidemic which has so far claimed several lives
in the southeast Asian countries.
The sources said the patient had been quarantined by the administration of
the hospital for treatment. They said he had been provided treatment by
the doctors while wearing special suits and gloves.
They said the hospital medical authorities had instructed the heirs of the
deceased that he should be buried in the same packing-suit in which he was
wrapped at the time his body was handed over to the family.
They also said neither his family nor the concerned authorities of the
provincial government were informed about the exact nature of the aliment.
Meanwhile, when The News contacted an officer of the Public Affairs
Department of the hospital, she expressed her ignorance about any
SARS-related death in the hospital. She also conceded that she had no
knowledge whether any SARS-infected patient was being treated at the hospital.
She said any such death at the hospital would be confirmed by Monday
morning, when the administration offices of the hospital would be opened
after the weekend.
Separately, some sources confided to The News that the young might have
died of the Congo virus, whose symptoms were similar to those of SARS.

[To date there has been only one case of probable SARS reported from South
Africa (see ProMED-mail posting SARS - worldwide (37):cases 20030409.0866)
in a traveller returning from known areas of SARS transmission.
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) cases are reported from South Africa
annually as well as from Pakistan (most recently in February 2003, see
Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan: suspected 20030228.0498 ) so the
mention of CCHF as a possible diagnosis seems more plausible, albeit in the
absence of a description of the symptoms, it is very hard to make any
speculations here. To state that the symptoms of CCHF are the same as SARS
is a bit far fetched. The classical presentation of CCHF includes: Sudden
onset of symptoms, with fever, myalgia (aching muscles), dizziness, neck
pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia
(sensitivity to light). There may be nausea, vomiting and sore throat early
on, which may be accompanied by diarrhoea and generalised abdominal pain.
Over the next few days, the patient may experience sharp mood swings, and
may become confused and aggressive. After 2 to 4 days, the agitation may be
replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain
may localize to the right upper quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly
(liver enlargement). Other clinical signs which emerge include tachycardia
(fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial
rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin), both on internal mucosal
surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin. The petechiae
may give way to ecchymoses (like a petechial rash, but covering larger
areas) and other haemorrhagic phenomena such as melaena (bleeding from the
upper bowel, passed as altered blood in the faeces), haematuria (blood in
the urine), epistaxis (nosebleeds) and bleeding from the gums. There is
usually evidence of hepatitis. The severely ill may develop hepatorenal
(i.e., liver and kidney) and pulmonary failure after the fifth day of
illness. (<http://www.who.int/inf-fs/en/fact208.html>).
In contrast, the case definition for a suspected case of SARS is high fever
(greater than 38 F), dry cough and breathing difficulties and a history of
contact with known SARS cases or travel to areas with known SARS
transmission; the case definition for a probable case of SARS is a
suspected case with radiographic evidence of pneumonia or adult respiratory
distress or autopsy findings consistent with ARDS without an identifiable
cause (<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/casedefinition/en/>).
More information on this reported case would be appreciated, including
clinical presentation with date of onset of illness, travel history
including dates of travel and laboratory studies conducted. - Mod.MPP]
