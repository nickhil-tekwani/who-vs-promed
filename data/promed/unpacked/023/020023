Scientists have discovered a strain of bacteria in possum faeces with the potential to cause flesh-eating ulcers in humans.

Infectious disease researchers at Victoria's Barwon Health [Australia] have found that the furry critters carry the buruli bacteria [_Mycobacterium ulcerans_] -- a disease-carrying germ with the potential to cause 'permanent disfigurement and disability' in humans if they come in to contact with it.

In most cases the bacteria leaves people with major skin ulcers, most prominently on the arms and legs. However depending on the level of human exposure it can potentially render people permanently disabled.

The most recent cases of exposure to the buruli bacteria have been in the Gippsland, Bellarine, and Mornington regions in Victoria.

Barwon Health Associate Professor Daniel O'Brien said possum faeces are rich in the bacteria. He told 774 ABC Melbourne there needs to be more research into whether contact with possum faeces is what causes buruli ulcers, also known as Bairnsdale ulcers, in humans. [Bairnsdale is a small city in East Gippsland, Victoria, Australia.]

'What we know in areas where we're getting infections and possums are infected is that their possum poo does carry a large amount of the organism,' he said. 'What we do think is a good public health measure is to remove the possum faeces from the area as much as possible and wash your hands as much as you can after that to minimise potential exposures.'

The organism that causes the ulcer is in the same family as that which causes tuberculosis and leprosy, according to the World Health Organisation. 'Patients who are not treated early suffer long-term functional disability,' The WHO states. The infection usually begins as a painless, itchy pimple which then breaks down to form an ulcer. If treated early the ulcer is curable but if left to spread the condition can be serious, according to Professor O'Brien. 'The treatment is really quite difficult. It often involves a long period of antibiotics, which can be difficult to take and often involves surgery.'

No infected possums have been detected in metropolitan Melbourne.

Professor O'Brien said a better understanding of how the bacteria is transmitted between the faeces and humans is needed. 'The most important thing for me is that we can prevent this infection, because at the moment we can treat it but we don't really know how to prevent it,' he said. 'When you see young kids coming into the clinic with really nasty ulcers on their arm ... what we really need to do is stop them getting it in the first place.'

[The following has been extracted from World Health Organization Buruli ulcer fact sheet no 199 (updated July 2014), available at http://www.who.int/entity/mediacentre/factsheets/fs199/en/index.html:

Buruli ulcer is a chronic debilitating skin and soft tissue infection with large ulcers usually on the legs or arms that can lead to bone infection and permanent disfigurement and disability. It initially presents as a nodule or large painless area of induration or a diffuse painless swelling of the legs, arms or face.

It is caused by _Mycobacterium ulcerans_, which needs a temperature between 29-33 deg C [84.2-91.4] and a low (2.5 percent) oxygen concentration to grow in vitro. The organism produces a unique toxin -- mycolactone, which causes tissue damage and inhibits the immune response. Local immunosuppressive properties of the mycolactone toxin enable the disease to progress with no pain and fever. The exact mode of transmission of _M. ulcerans_ is still unknown. The diagnosis can be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct microscopy, histopathology, and culture.

Buruli ulcer has been reported in over 30 countries usually with subtropical and temperate climates in Africa, South America, Asia, and Western Pacific regions. Countries in West and Central Africa -- Benin, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ghana -- report the majority of cases. In Africa, about 48 percent of those affected are children under 15 years, whereas in Australia, 10 percent are children under 15 years; and in Japan, 19 percent are children under 15 years. 80 percent of cases detected early can be cured with a combination of antibiotics; however, late diagnosis can result in long and costly hospitalizations with significant morbidity and disability.

Different combination of antibiotics given for 8 weeks are used to treat the Buruli ulcer irrespective of the stage. Medical treatment is rifampin, 10 mg/kg orally once daily combined with either streptomycin, 15 mg/kg intramuscularly once daily or clarithromycin, 7.5 mg/kg orally twice daily for 8 weeks, in addition to surgical wound management. Rifampin combined with moxifloxacin (400 mg orally once daily) has also been used.

In addition to Greater Melbourne, the Australian state of Victoria is divided into regions, one of which is Gippsland. The Mornington Peninsula is located southeast of Melbourne and the Bellarine Peninsula is located southwest of Melbourne.
