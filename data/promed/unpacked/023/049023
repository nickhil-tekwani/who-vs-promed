We are, unfortunately, having an outbreak of measles in Japan,
particularly in the Kanto area, including Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama,
and Chiba Prefectures. The scale is much smaller than an outbreak in
2001, although the number of young patients is high. Many of them are
not immunized and [did not suffer from measles].
I would like to send the epidemiological data on the present
situation (19W 2007) of measles in Japan summarized by the Infectious
Disease Surveillance Center/NIID for your information. These data are
available weekly on our website
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/disease/measles/index.html> as the "Infectious
Disease Weekly Report," but it is written in Japanese. The following
is the text officially carried on our website:
-----
Measles in Japan; week 19 [7-13 May 2007]
Infectious Disease Surveillance Center, National Institute of
Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan
The National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID) collects data
related to measles from approximately 3000 pediatric sentinels around
the country through the National Epidemiological Surveillance of
Infectious Diseases (NESID) -- based upon the Infectious Disease
Control Law -- and updates them in the Infectious Disease Weekly
Report (IDWR) each week.
According to the NESID, 214 cases (0.071 cases per sentinel) from 26
different prefectures were reported in week 19 (7-13 May 2007). This
is a huge increase compared to the previous week (88 cases, 0.030
cases per sentinel). Reported cases are apparently increasing in
South Kanto region (Tokyo, Saitama, Kanagawa, and Chiba prefecture)
and the case-reported area is expanding nationwide. The number of
cumulative cases reported from the pediatric sentinels between week 1
through 19 (2007) is 691 and already exceeded the total yearly
reported cases in 2005 and 2006 (537, 519 respectively). A closer
look at the data shows that the weekly reported number of cases
became highest in week 19 in all 5 of the highest case-reported
prefectures in 2007. There is an increase in the proportion of
reported cases among 10- to 14-year-olds (33.9 percent) compared to
the previous years, while it is decreasing among 0- to 4-year-olds
(39.7 percent).
In terms of measles among adolescents and adults (15 years old and
older), data is collected from approximately 450 hospital sentinels
across the country. The number of cases reported during week 19 was
53 (0.117 cases per sentinel) and was way higher than the previous
week (25 cases, 0.055 cases per sentinel). Tokyo has the highest
reported number of cases per week (19 cases), which has been
increasing since week 15 [9-15 Apr 2007]. The number of cumulative
cases reported from the hospital sentinels between week 1 through 19
2007 is 208 cases, and more than 60 percent (132 cases) are reported
from South Kanto region, including Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, and
Chiba Prefecture. However, reports from other regions are increasing
as well. More than 80 percent of cases were under 29 years of age.
The number of reported case of measles both from pediatric sentinels
and hospital sentinels has increased dramatically. The center of the
epidemic is in South Kanto, and cases are continuously increasing,
but the trend is being observed nationwide. Based on previous data
from NESID, measles cases reported in Japan peaked around week 19 in
pediatrics and week 20 in adolescents and adults. Thus, in a sense,
we may be observing the peak of the measles epidemic. However, the
cumulative number of reported cases is higher than in previous years,
and epidemic areas are expanding so that we need to pay close
attention to this transition.
Measles has been eradicated from several countries in the world, and
the World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific
(WPRO) aims to eradicate measles by 2012. Japan must work hard not to
be left behind by other countries and should avoid another large
measles outbreak like the one in 2001. To meet this goal, it is
important to pay attention to the trend in the NESID as well as to
conduct rapid and effective intervention to prevent further
outbreaks. Once a case of measles is diagnosed in schools or
institutional settings, it is desirable to practice accurate
intervention immediately. Amid the current outbreak, those who have
never been vaccinated or who do not have any history of the disease
should receive measles vaccine immediately. As infants and young
children are most susceptible to measles virus, it is highly
recommended that they receive the measles vaccination, which 1st dose
is given at the age of one year old and the 2nd dose by the entrance
to elementary school.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Nobuhiko Okabe for the rapid
response in sending in this authoritative report on the measles
outbreak in Japan. From the report above, it does appear as though
the epicenter of the outbreak is still in the Kanto area, although
there are indications that the outbreak may be spreading
geographically. - Mod.MPP]
