Social mobilization
-------------------
Kampala:

- TV spots on Ebola and Marburg continue to run on 4 TV stations (WBS, UBC, NTV, NBS)
- IEC materials distribution is ongoing in Kampala with support from UNICEF
Mpigi, Kasese:
- Radio spots and talks shows are ongoing on local FM radios.

Psychosocial support
--------------------
Kampala:
- The team plans to work with case management teams and have cases/suspects counseled in addition to following up other contacts identified by contact tracing teams to be in need of psychosocial support
Mpigi:
- The psychosocial team from the national level has been requested to provide services to the relatives of the deceased Marburg victim in Mpigi district

Logistics
---------
- In Mpigi the laboratory personnel who burnt up all his belongings wants to be compensated if possible; partners have been called upon to support the cause
- Budgets for district response activities are not yet supported

Challenges/gaps
---------------
- The NTF and DTFs cannot execute the planned national and district wide activities due to lack of funding and this has negatively impacted the Marburg control planned activities. These include sensitization of VHTs [village health team workers], training of HWs [health workers], contact tracing, and responding to alert cases among others
Planned activities:
- Take a repeat blood sample from a patient admitted at Mulago isolation facility
- Mobilization of resources for District Response Plans
- Train health workers in the various health facilities in Kampala and neighboring districts on VHF [viral hemorrhagic fevers]
- Strengthen surveillance nationwide, especially in Kampala, Kasese, Mpigi, Wakiso, Ibanda, and Kamwenge
- Continue investigations for the source of exposure for the index case
