Two new suspected cases of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) have been found
among cattle in northern Japan, the Agriculture Ministry said on Thursday
[11 May 2000.
The news came shortly after it appeared Japan had come a step closer to
declaring itself free of the deadly disease. The ministry said 2 cattle
suspected of having the disease had been found on a farm in Japan's
northern island of Hokkaido. The cattle have been slaughtered, the ministry
said. The ministry said it had prohibited the movement of animals within a
10 km radius of the farm where the suspected cases were found.
News of the new cases in Hokkaido came a day after two local governments in
Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures, Japan's main cattle-raising region,
said they had found no new traces of the deadly livestock disease.
The first outbreak of the disease in Japan since 1908 was discovered on 25
Mar 2000 among cattle on a farm in Miyazaki, prompting many countries to
ban imports of Japanese meat and livestock products.
