CALICIVIRUS, HEMORRHAGIC, FELINE - USA (CALIFORNIA) (02)

The previous report on hemorrhagic calicivirus in cats contained some
errors which this moderator regrets and seeks to correct. The virus
responsible for this outbreak is a feline calicivirus with no relation to
the calicivirus responsible for the rabbit hemorrhagic disease outbreak
seen in Australia.
The rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) (responsible for the outbreak
in Australia) does not grow in cell culture. Information provided in Dr.
Foley's report on the feline calicivirus outbreak clearly stated the feline
calicivirus diagnosis was based on culture from a number of different tissues.
Likewise, Dr. Foley's discussion clearly stated that this particular strain
of calicivirus does not affect other species. Information on this outbreak
was cross-posted to several rabbit listserve groups, which led to confusion
and resulted in incorrect information being presented in this moderator's
commentary.
Furthermore, the rabbit calicivirus (RCV) is not related to the
RHDV. European brown hare syndrome (EBHS) is a disease very similar to
RHD, but its agent is EBHSV, a virus able to infect hares but not rabbits.
I apologize for the confusion. - Mod.TG
