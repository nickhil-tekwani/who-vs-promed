Veterinary Services personnel would like to provide brief additional information on the posting above, including information responsive to the moderator's question on depopulation at the end of the posting: "However, the article does not tell us if all the herds found with brucellosis were depopulated, or what the status is of the herds mentioned in this article. We know one herd was tested and all but 2 animals were depopulated, but what about the other herds mentioned?"

The federal response assistance was provided by Veterinary Services of USDA' Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

All reactor herds in NY were depopulated through a combination of controlled marketing to slaughter and euthanasia.

A more complete report of the events is being written for submission to a peer-reviewed journal soon.

[We appreciate Dr Levings and APHIS answering the question that all affected herds were depopulate. We look forward to the journal article regarding more details of this sad but interesting situation. - Mod.TG]
