A total of 148 healthcare institutions including general hospitals, outpatient departments, neighborhood health stations, clinics, and school health offices attended the meeting.

The meeting deployed infectious hemorrhagic fever prevention and control work in Yanta District, raising the level of diagnosis and treatment of infectious hemorrhagic fever among healthcare personnel.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Dan Silver

[This meeting likely is in response to the reported recent cases of hemorrhagic fever in Shaanxi province. The previous report did not specify the numbers of cases, dates on which they occurred, or their etiology (see ProMED-mail archive no 20151207.3844900). The agenda of the meeting implies that the etiology is known.

There are several possible etiologies of the reported hemorrhagic disease cases that could be caused by a variety of viruses such as hantaviruses, including Hantaan virus and Seoul virus, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, for example. Bacteria could be involved as well. ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving information about the pathogens responsible for these cases of hemorrhagic disease.
