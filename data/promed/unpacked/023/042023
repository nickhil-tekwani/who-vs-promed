Antibodies to Schmallenberg virus (SBV) were detected in the serum of 21 goats in western Poland along the border with Germany. Blood was collected between 24 and 30 Jul 2012 from 230 adult (over one-year-old) goats kept on farms where no new goat had been introduced since the beginning of 2011. ELISA testing (ID Screen Schmallenberg virus indirect, IDvet Innovative Diagnostics) was used as a diagnostic method.

This is the 1st notification of the presence of antibodies to SBV in Central and Eastern Europe.

[ProMED-mail is very grateful to Dr Kaba and his colleagues at the Warsaw Veterinary Faculty for the above firsthand information.

The timely detection of SBV antibodies in ruminants in western Poland, similar to the recent detection of the virus in Austria, have been in line with expectations, in view of SBV circulation in neighbouring Germany, including its eastern territories. See the updated SBV map of Germany at http://tinyurl.com/cemgo58.

Results of SBV monitoring in the other eastern neighbour of Germany, namely the Czech Republic, is anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
