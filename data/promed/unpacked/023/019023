EU blames Asian wild boar for Britain's swine fever
The outbreak of classical swine fever (CSF) in Britain has its origins in
Asia and the virus was brought into Europe 2 years ago by an illegally
imported wild boar, the European Commission (EC) said.
Researchers at the European Union's (EU) swine fever laboratory in Hanover,
Germany have identified the strain which has hit 5 farms in the east of
England and may have spread elsewhere. They have matched it to one already
on their files, sourcing it to a wild boar imported into continental Europe
in 1998, EU spokeswoman Andrea Dahmen told journalists.
This is the first time the strain has appeared since and it was likely the
boar infected a pig on the continent subsequently exported into Britain,
she added. She could not say exactly where in Asia the boar had come from
or in which EU country it was found. But because it was illegally imported,
it had no vaccination certificates. "All I can say is the virus strain
comes from a wild boar from Asia. It has been isolated and stored in our
laboratory in Hanover," she said.
Britain"s Agriculture Minister Nick Brown met with pig industry leaders on
Friday over the crisis, the latest to hit farmers in the country just as
they are recovering from the mad cow disease outbreak and subsequent ban on
beef exports.
The EU"s powerful Standing Veterinary Committee is due next Tuesday to
examine an export ban imposed by the Commission on English pigs earlier
this week. The committee could either endorse the ban, which provisionally
lasts until August 31, or reduce its scope to the area affected.
The identification of the strain has calmed some fears in Europe because it
had been suspected the virus was the same one that hit the Netherlands in
1997 and subsequently spread to Belgium and Germany. Some 14 million pigs
were slaughtered in total in the 1997 outbreak and close to a billion euros
paid out in compensation. "We had thought there was possibly a reservoir of
that virus left in Europe. That seems not the case now," Dahmen said.

Seven pig farms outside the East Anglia region are now being tested for
classical swine fever (CSF), a spokeswoman for the U.K. Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) said. Farms in Cheshire, Derbyshire,
Lincolnshire, Lancashire, Sussex, Dorset and the Isle of Wight are
undergoing tests, she said. The farms are being tested either because they
have a connection with British Quality Pigs (BQP), the company owning the
nursery unit in which the disease was first found, or because farmers
suspect the disease and have asked MAFF veterinarians to test their animals.
If any of the farms are confirmed to have been infected with CSF, it would
mean the disease has spread across the U.K., jeopardizing chances the
European Union-wide ban on English live pig exports and semen will be
lifted soon.
CSF is harmless to humans, but it is highly contagious in pig herds. In the
last EU outbreak 2 years ago, in the Netherlands, the disease led to the
slaughtering of 1 million pigs.
