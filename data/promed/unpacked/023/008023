Equine infectious anaemia detected in horses
--------------------------------------------
Equine infectious anaemia (EIA) has been detected in 2 horses in Wiltshire
following importation from Romania via Belgium, DEFRA confirmed today [19
Jan 2010].

The premises is currently under restriction and the 2 infected horses will
be humanely destroyed in line with existing regulations. The other horses
on the premises will be subject to epidemiological investigation in the
coming weeks. A further 2 horses have also been under investigation and
test results have proved negative.

The animals arrived in a group of 10 horses, 9 of which originated from
Romania and one from Belgium. The 9 Romanian horses were tested for EIA as
part of routine post-import testing. 7 horses all tested negative. The
horse that originated in Belgium is due to be tested shortly.

Chief veterinary officer, Nigel Gibbens, said: "This is the 1st case of
equine infectious anaemia infected animals being imported into Great
Britain since 1976 and shows the success of our post import testing regime.
These were apparently healthy horses carrying a notifiable disease that we
are keen to keep out of Great Britain. After considering the risk I have
decided to take appropriate action and humanely destroy these 2 horses that
tested positive."

Notes to editors
----------------
- equine infectious anaemia (EIA) is a virus disease of horses causing
intermittent fever, anaemia, emaciation, and death. It can be transmitted
by the exchange of blood by biting insects and occurs typically in
low-lying swampy areas
- a notifiable disease is a disease named in section 88 of the Animal
Health Act 1981 or an Order made under that Act and must be reported
- this disease occurs in horses, mules, and donkeys. Animals may be
acutely, chronically or sub clinically affected. The incubation period is
variable, from a matter of days to a few months but generally 1 to 3 weeks.
Antibodies usually develop 7 to 14 days after infection and last for life
- for an animal testing positively for EIA, the only course of action is to
humanely put it down. This may be for the welfare of the affected horse,
but also to protect other horses from infection. Once infected, horses are
infected for life and can pose a risk to other horses in close proximity.
We have agreed with equine industry veterinary surgeons that destruction is
the right response in this particular case. This response is in accordance
with both the Infectious Disease of Horses Order 1987 and the Specified
Disease (Notification and Slaughter) Order 2006
- EIA is not a zoonotic disease and has no human health implications.

[The following additional information is partly based upon DEFRA's fact
sheet on equine infectious anaemia:

Infectious equine anaemia (EIA) or "swamp fever" is a virus disease of
horses causing intermittent fever, anaemia, emaciation, and death. It can
be transmitted by mechanical transfer of blood by biting insects and occurs
typically in low-lying swampy areas. The disease was first described in
France in 1843. The term "swamp fever" was first used by Torrance in 1903
in Canada, where this disease had been known before 1882. Although the
infectious nature of this disease had long been suspected, a viral case was
not definitely established until 1904. The virus was classified as a
retrovirus in 1976 and later grouped with the lentiviruses (that is,
non-tumour forming exogenous retroviruses) of which the human AIDS virus is
also a member. As in other lentivirus infections, animals remain infected
for life. EIA has a worldwide distribution. Early in the 20th century
serious outbreaks occurred in France, Japan, and America. During the decade
1980 to 1989 the disease was reported in many parts of America, Asia
(India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand), Europe (Austria, France,
Greece, Italy, Romania, USSR, and Yugoslavia), and Australia.

The chief veterinary officer of the UK submitted on Wed 20 Jan 2009, an
"immediate notification" to the OIE on the event. The notification,
including a map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=8868>.

The following abridged comments are derived from the said notification:

Affected population: the farm owner regularly sources his animals from
continental Europe. There are 50 horses and ponies with a range of ages on
the premises. There are indications that during the risk period, most of
the horses have been housed due to the adverse cold weather conditions in
Great Britain. The horses were all clinically normal on inspection, but one
of the positive mares showed a mild increased temperature.

Epidemiological comments: The consignment was randomly checked as part of
routine measures to confirm compliance with trade rules. Restrictions have
been placed on the infected premises and one in-contact premises.

Following humane slaughter and destruction of the 2 positive horses on 20
Jan 2010, all horses on the infected premises will be blood sampled and
tested (Coggin's test) and subsequent Coggin's tests will be carried out at
30 day intervals up to 90 days.

According to expert entomological opinion, mechanical transmissions by
vectors (tabanids) seem not applicable as vectors are only present in Great
Britain as a larvae stage at this time of year. Active adults are only
present in Great Britain from May to August.

A detailed epidemiological investigation is currently being carried out.-
