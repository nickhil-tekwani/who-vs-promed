Cyclosporiasis: Ontario
Ten outbreaks of cyclosporiasis have recently been identified in the
greater Toronto area. These are related to separate events at which foods
were consumed. Eight of the events occurred in Toronto, 1 in York Region,
and 1 in Peterborough health unit areas. All events appear to have
occurred in the period of May 7-15th. The number of attendees at each
event ranged from 4 to 240. At least one case from each event has been
laboratory confirmed. Several additional sporadic cases have also been
confirmed by the private and public health laboratories. The outbreaks are
being investigated by local health departments, in conjunction with the
Public Health Branch and Laboratory Services Branch of the Ontario Ministry
of Health, with participation from Health Canada (LCDC and Foods
Directorate), the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and the Centres for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta. No specific food or beverage has
been implicated as yet, however, berries were consumed at all of the
events, with more than one type of berry consumed at each. Detailed
investigations of several of the outbreaks are ongoing in order to identify
the source. Cyclosporiasis is acquired by ingestion of contaminated food
or water. The diagnosis of cyclosporiasis requires specific laboratory
tests which may not be routinely performed on stools submitted for analysis
of diarrheal illness.
Outbreaks of cyclosporiasis occurred in Ontario in the late spring of 1996
and 1997. Cyclosporiasis outbreaks have not been reported from other
Canadian jurisdictions this season.
