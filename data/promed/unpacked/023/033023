Levels of influenza activity indicate a west-to-east progression across Europe
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
--------
Consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI) are increasing in most countries in the WHO European Region. In line with observations in previous seasons, influenza activity appears to be migrating from west to east, with countries in the west possibly having reached peak activity while those in the east show slow increases. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 remains predominant with co-circulation of influenza A(H3N2) and type B viruses. The proportion of samples from sentinel and non-sentinel sources testing positive for influenza reached its highest level (49 percent) so far this season The proportion of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases testing positive for influenza continued to increase, mainly owing to influenza A.

Virological Surveillance
-------------------
In week 04/2013, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses continued to dominate: of 2160 influenza A viruses subtyped, 1739 (81 percent) were A(H1N1)pdm09 while only 421 (19 percent) were A(H3N2). This presents a very different picture from the 2011/2012 influenza season, when A(H1N1)pdm09 detections were rare, but is similar to the 2010/2011 season.

In the 32 countries testing 20 or more sentinel specimens, influenza positivity ranged from 0 percent to 95.4 percent, with a median of 46 percent (mean: 45 percent).

Since the beginning of the season (week 40/2012), 22 029 influenza viruses from sentinel and non-sentinel sources have been typed: 15 307 (69 percent) were influenza A and 6 722 (31 percent) influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 9163 were subtyped: 6458 (70 percent) as A(H1N1)pdm09 and 2705 (30 percent) as A(H3N2). In addition, the lineage for 999 influenza B viruses has been determined since week 40/2012: 897 (90 percent) belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage and 102 (10 percent) to B/Victoria.

Circulation of influenza viruses in week 04/2013 remained diverse and similar to the previous week across the Region. Influenza A (mainly A(H1N1)pdm09) was reported as the dominant virus in an increasing number of countries in northern, eastern and central Europe, and Turkey, while influenza B was reported as the dominant virus in some countries in the southern and western parts of the Region. Between these areas, co-circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and influenza B was reported.

Virus strain characterisations
------------------------
For the 2012/2013 northern hemisphere influenza season, the WHO recommends inclusion of A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like, A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like and B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like (from the B/Yamagata lineage) viruses in vaccines.

Since week 40/2012, 1149 influenza viruses characterized antigenically by 12 countries (Denmark, the United Kingdom (England), Germany, Greece, Latvia, Portugal, Romania, the Russian Federation, Scotland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland) corresponded with the viruses recommended by the WHO for inclusion in the current northern hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine). 12 countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland) have characterized 318 influenza viruses genetically.

Both A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses have evolved to fall into a number of different genetic groups, which are all antigenically similar to their vaccine viruses, A/California/7/2009 and A/Victoria/361/2011, respectively. Influenza B viruses of the B/Victoria/2/87 and the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineages are co-circulating with the clear dominance of the B/Yamagata lineage viruses this season. Influenza B viruses of the B/Victoria lineage all fall within the B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade and are antigenically indistinguishable. B/Yamagata lineage viruses in circulation clearly fall into two distinct genetic clades, represented by B/Estonia/55669/2011 (Clade 2) and B/Wisconsin/1/2010 (Clade 3) respectively. Viruses in these clades can be distinguished antigenically from each other, but the antigenic differentiation of these clades is not clear-cut as post-infection ferret antisera raised against clade 2 viruses are more clade-specific than are antisera raised against clade 3 viruses. Nevertheless, viruses within these clades remain antigenically similar to the current vaccine virus.

Monitoring of susceptibility to antiviral drugs
--------------------------------------
Since week 40/2012, 7 countries (Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have screened 262 viruses for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. The 95 influenza A(H3N2) and 67 influenza B viruses showed susceptibility to both drugs. Of the 100 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested, 99 showed susceptibility to both drugs and one virus carrying the neuraminidase H275Y amino acid substitution, causing resistance to oseltamivir, was detected in the Netherlands in a hospitalized immunocompromised patient exposed to oseltamivir through treatment.

The 14 influenza A(H3N2) and 10 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses screened for susceptibility to adamantanes were found to be resistant.

Outpatient surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ILI and ARI consultation rates continue to increase in the eastern part of the Region, but mainly with reported low intensity levels (Map 2). In Norway, Poland and the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland), consultation rates for ILI and ARI are decreasing, along with the numbers of specimens testing positive for influenza. Most of the countries across the Region reported regional or widespread circulation of influenza for week 04/2013. Of the 20 countries that have established epidemic thresholds, 4 (Kazakhstan, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine) reported ILI/ARI consultation rates below their national threshold levels.

Hospital surveillance for SARI
------------------------
The proportion of respiratory specimens from patients with SARI testing positive for influenza has continued to rise since week 01/2013, in line with increasing influenza activity in countries reporting on SARI hospitalizations. Overall, the majority of countries reported cases mainly in the group aged 0-4 years.

[By contrast in North America the predominant virus in the current season has been influenza A(H3N2) (characterized as A/Victoria/361/2011-like), followed by influenza B (Yamagata and Victoria lineages) and to a lesser extent influenza A(H1N1)pdm09) (A/California/7/2009-like). 3 of these 4 strains are included in the 2012-2013 influenza vaccine for the northern hemisphere. With regards to antiviral resistance, of the subset of influenza cases analyzed this season, the majority (99.9 percent) are susceptible to oseltamivir and all are susceptible to zanamivir.

The majority of characterized viruses from the WHO European Region have been similar to the current Northern hemisphere vaccine viruses.

The current winter influenza epidemic in the United States appears to have progressed from South to North. Whereas in the European Region the corresponding winter influenza is clearly progressing from west to east. It is not immediately obvious why this should be.
