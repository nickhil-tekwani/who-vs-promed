[Ref: E Martinez-de la Parte et al: First report of white mould of beans caused by _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_ in Cuba. New Disease Reports (2013) 27, 5; DOI:10.5197/j.2044-0588.2013.027.005]

Common bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_) constitutes the most important legume food crop in Cuba. In January 2012, it was noticed that plants in bean fields began to wilt and die in the Matanzas, Mayabeque and Artemisa provinces. Disease incidence varied amongst fields, ranging from 21 to 85 percent. Initial symptoms included wilting of leaves, watery spots on the pods and stems, followed by the development of a fluffy white mycelium in the rotted areas.

In all fields, sclerotia were present along with white mycelia. [The fungus was] identified as _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_ based on morphological characteristics. Pathogenicity tests were carried out for 2 isolates [and] _S. sclerotiorum_ was successfully recovered from infected plant tissue, fulfilling Koch's postulates.

White mould occurs in most of the common bean producing regions of the world, causing significant crop damage. For example, in Florida _S. sclerotiorum_ caused an estimated 5-10 percent annual loss, while reductions of 40-70 percent in dry bean yields grown under irrigation are commonly observed in Brazil.

In Cuba, where similar climatic conditions exist, similar yield losses can be expected. Despite beans being a traditional crop in Cuba planted twice a year and extensively studied for phytopathogenic fungi, white mould of beans has not been previously reported. Therefore, this is the 1st report of the presence of white mould caused by _S. sclerotiorum_ in Cuba.

[_Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_, also called white mould, is one of the most nonspecific and successful of plant pathogens, with around 400 known hosts worldwide, including many crop species. It causes white fungal growth on aerial plant parts which leads to rotting, wilting and death of plants. For bean crops, yield losses may be extensive, and a small percentage of diseased pods may lead to downgrading of the quality of an entire harvest of field beans.

The fungus is primarily soilborne and has a complex disease cycle. It can survive in soil as sclerotia and is also spread by infected plant material, mechanical means and wind-borne spores. Risk of crop infection depends on the previous disease history of an area as well as weather conditions. Disease management includes cultural practices (such as long term crop rotation with non-hosts and deep ploughing to minimise inoculum) and fungicide applications. However, fungicides may not be very effective against soilborne fungal pathogens.

Pathogen diagnosis above appears to rest entirely on traditional morphological methods. However, molecular and immunological methods are now also available for reliable diagnosis of _S. sclerotiorum_ (see links below).
