On 27 Dec 2019, Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) officials confirmed a Whatcom County horse was infected with equine influenza (EI) and an additional 10 animals were exposed. The horse testing positive, an unvaccinated yearling stallion, experienced clinical signs including coughing and nasal discharge beginning on 24 Dec 2019. He is reported as recovering, and a voluntary quarantine is in effect.

Equine influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease infecting horses, ponies, and other equids, such as donkeys, mules, and zebras. The virus causing it is spread via saliva and respiratory secretions from infected horses. Horses are commonly exposed via horse-to-horse contact; aerosol transmission from coughing and sneezing; and contact with human's contaminated hands, shoes, or clothes or contaminated tack, buckets, or other equipment.

Clinical signs of equine influenza infection can include a high fever (up to 106 F / 41 C); a dry, hacking cough; depression; weakness; anorexia; serous (watery) nasal discharge; and slightly enlarged lymph nodes. Consider monitoring your horse's health at shows by taking temperature daily, which can help you pick up on signs of infection early and take appropriate measures to reduce disease spread.

Vaccination is an important and inexpensive way to protect your horse. US Equestrian requires proof that horses have had an equine influenza vaccination within the 6 months prior to attending organization-sanctioned competitions or events. Your veterinarian can help you determine what other vaccines your horse might benefit from.

In addition to vaccinating, following strict biosecurity protocols can help reduce your horse's chance of infection and developing disease. Such measures include quarantining new equine arrivals at barns, disinfecting buckets and equipment, and preventing nose-to-nose contact between horses.

[The article tells us the equine was unvaccinated.

Equine influenza is contagious among equids, and vaccination is strongly encouraged. Getting the vaccine helps protect your animal and reduces animal pain and owner/caretaker frustration and anxiety.

While getting the vaccine at home is important, the importance increases if you are traveling with your animal. Traveling can be stressful, especially to the immune system. So please take care of your animal and vaccinate.

Recall that such things as water buckets should not be shared between horses, as this is a mechanism of transmission. - Mod.TG
