Scientists Screen Reptiles to Trace Sleeping Sickness
-----------------------------------------------------
Scientists have started screening crocodiles, monitor-lizards, snakes
and other reptiles to establish whether they are reservoirs for
sleeping sickness and nagana disease parasites countrywide.

This follows a new study which found that domestic animals are
reservoirs for sleeping sickness. The veterinary doctors have made
recommendations based on this study to the Government to vaccinate
all goats, pigs, cattle and sheep. Sleeping sickness affects people,
while nagana affects animals.

The reptile screening is on realisation that the animals harbor
sleeping sickness parasites even though they do not get sick
themselves. However, the disease is picked by tsetse fly bites and
passed on to people.

Dr. Loyce Okidi, the head of Sleeping Sickness Research Programme at
the National Livestock Resources Research Institute (NaLIRRI) said
their preliminary observations indicate that the reptiles offer blood
meals to tsetse flies in the wild. The diseases are transmitted by
the flies when they suck blood from an infected host. "Although no
study has established that these parasites can thrive comfortably
inside the reptiles, we are treating them suspiciously," she noted.

Okidi said their studies have indicated that there is a sharp
increment in the river line tsetse flies population in almost all
parts of the country's rivers and drainage network. She said it was
possible that the reptiles could be playing a role in the spread of
the flies following the River Nile, Kagera River Basin and Lake Kyoga
to areas where they had not been recorded in the last 2 decades.

The study follows an overwhelming tsetse flies population increase in
the country. Over 60 percent of the country is now endemic. This has
prompted an upsurge in sleeping sickness and nagana diseases in
regions where it had not previously recorded.

Researchers said there was increased sleeping sickness and nagana
cases in the Central Region, Northern and Eastern Uganda. More people
are dying of the disease in rural areas when they fail to report to
hospitals early enough when they self-medicate at home, confusing the
disease for malaria.

Uganda Wildlife Okidi said from Busoga region, the disease has spread
to Apac, Amuria, Kaheramaido, Tororo and parts of Soroti district.
The riverine species, Glossina f fuscipes and savanna adapted species
(Glossina morsitans, G. pallidipes) were prevalent.

They have adapted extensively to the vast savanna grasslands in the
cattle corridor. The corridor supports Uganda's livestock herd and
wild animals. It stretches from Rakai district in southwestern Uganda
to Nakapiripirit in Karamoja region.

Uganda's vulnerability is also caused by the geographical location on
a plateau tilting northwards. The rivers that flow across the country
make the insects spread much easier.

[Trypanosomes can infect a variety of mammalian, avian and reptile
hosts, but usually reptile trypanosomes can not be transmitted to
mammals. These parasites can not be differentiated by microscopy and
need to be typed by molecular fingerprinting in order to identify
then correctly. This apply especially to trypanosomes found in the
tse tse fly vector. If reptile blood can be found in tse tse flies it
show that they feed on reptiles not that reptile trypanosomes are
transmitted to cattle and/or humans. - Mod.EP
