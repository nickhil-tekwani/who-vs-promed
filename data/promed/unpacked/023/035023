Bacterial meningitis, the often fatal infection that usually attacks
infants, is becoming more resistant to drugs, researchers reported in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. Doctors in Paris said [that one
of the microorganisms commonly responsible for the disease [is now
exhibiting resistance to the antibiotic chloramphenicol. The resistant
bacterial strain was isolated in 11 patients in Vietnam and one in France
[according to researchers led by Marc Galimand of the National Reference
Center for Antibiotics.
The problem is expected to have its greatest impact in developing countries
where chloramphenicol is frequently used to treat it because the drug is
cheap and requires only a single injection, the researchers said.
[Chloramphenicol also crosses the blood-brain barrier readily, thereby
making it easier to achieve therapeutic levels of antibiotic in the CNS --
a problem for many other antimicrobials. - Mod.ES "The emergence of
high-level chloramphenicol resistance ... is of great concern," the
Galimand group said. In developed countries, chloramphenicol, sold under
the brand name Chloromycetin by Parke-Davis, is far less popular than other
medicines because it can cause blood problems, including, in rare
instances, a fatal form of anemia.
In a given year 4.5 children per 100,000 population between the ages of one
month and 23 months will contract meningitis. Resistance to the disease
grows as a person ages.
