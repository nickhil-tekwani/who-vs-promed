Sarawak will vaccinate all pigs within a two-kilometre radius of areas with
confirmed cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) as part of its preventive
measures, State Agriculture and Food Industries Minister Datuk Adenan Satem
said today.
He said that in principle, the state government would adopt a policy of
vaccinating the pigs to reduce infection and carriers in the pig
population. "For commercial pig farms, the owners are encouraged to
vaccinate their pigs at their own cost," he said.
Sarawak has a 220,000 pig population with 80% of them in the Kuching and
Samarahan divisions.
[So far, there have been five confirmed JE cases (human) reported in
Sarawak but no deaths, according to an earlier Bernama report. - Mod.CYC
