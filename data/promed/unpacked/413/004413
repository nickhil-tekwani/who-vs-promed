It isn't easy being a bird.

In the 1st place, New Year's Eve [31 Dec 2010] fireworks were blamed
in central Arkansas for making thousands of blackbirds confused,
crashing into homes, cars and each other. Then 300 miles to the south
in Louisiana, power lines likely killed about 450 birds, littering a
highway near Baton Rouge.

On Wednesday [5 Jan 2010], Kentucky wildlife officials said several
hundred grackles, red wing blackbirds, robins and starlings were
found dead last week in the western part of the state.

It's almost certainly a coincidence the events happened within days
of each other, Louisiana's state wildlife veterinarian Jim LaCour
said Tuesday. "I haven't found anything to link the 2 at this point."

Mass bird deaths aren't uncommon. The U.S. Geological Service's
website listed about 90 mass deaths of birds and other wildlife from
June 2010 through 12 Dec 2010. There were 5 mass deaths of at least
1000 birds, with the largest near Houston, Minnesota, where parasite
infestations killed about 4000 water birds between 6 Sep 2010 and 26 Nov 2010.

Officials acknowledged, though, they may never know exactly what
caused the large number of deaths.

Wildlife officials in both Arkansas and Louisiana sent carcasses to
researchers at the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison,
Wisconsin, and the University of Georgia. Results are not expected
for 2 weeks or longer.

E. coli?
--------
In 1999, several thousand grackles fell from the sky and staggered
about before dying in north Louisiana. It took 5 months to get the
diagnosis: an E. coli infection of the air sacs in their skulls.

"I hope things go faster than that," said Paul Slota, branch chief
for the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin. He
said necropsies of the Arkansas birds began Tuesday afternoon.

"If it isn't strictly trauma, it may take more time to get results
back," he said. "When nothing shows up, you run the tests longer and
let it incubate longer."

Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources spokesman Mark
Marraccini says someone called police about the discovery in
Kentucky, and they alerted state officials.

Marraccini says tests performed on the birds ruled out diseases or
poisons. He said the deaths could have been caused by weather or
another natural event.
