The number of dengue fever cases in the capital
has decreased to 2200 year-to-date, compared to
more than 6000 in the same period last year
[2009]. Jakarta Health Agency head Dien Emawati
said Sunday [7 Mar 2010] that its weekly
operations had been successful as shown by the
significant decrease on the number of the cases.

She urged residents be aware of the possibility
of contracting dengue fever or other seasonal
diseases. News portal
<http://www.beritajakarta.com> said data from the
agency showed that the city was experiencing a
decreasing trend in the number of dengue cases.
In 2008, it recorded 28 400 cases, but this
dropped to 18 000 a year later. Some areas,
however, are still struggling with the disease,
including up-scale housing areas in Menteng,
Central Jakarta, and Pondok Indah, South Jakarta.

The agency said earlier that the prevalence of
cases in these areas was due to poor control of
stagnant water and the refusal of residents to
allow health officials into their homes to fumigate or monitor conditions.

In Tully, 2 more residents have been struck down
with dengue fever. Officials yesterday [10 Mar
2010] confirmed a male and a female had been
diagnosed with [dengue virus] type 2 of the
mosquito-borne disease [virus], bringing the
total number of cases in the Far North this
season to 3. The 2 new cases were identified
close to where a woman in her 20s who was
diagnosed with type 2 dengue [virus infection] 2 weeks ago was living.

A response team has visited Tully, completing
yard inspections and setting traps to kill dengue
mosquitoes. Queensland Health medical director Dr
Jeffrey Hanna said it was no time for Tully
residents to be complacent. "There is a large
amount of people moving between Tully and the
rest of North Queensland, including Townsville
and Cairns where historically we have had regular
dengue outbreaks," Dr Hanna said.

[Although dengue virus transmission was reported
halted in Townsville, North Queensland, it
continues further north in the state in Tully.
One hopes that the control measures successfully
applied in Townsville are equally successful in Tully.

El Salvador Health Authorities indicated their
concern about the dengue epidemic, as well as
negative collaboration of the population for
prevention measures. The dengue [outbreak]
obligated the Ministry of Health and units of
Civil Protection to declare a national yellow
alert. However, the citizens continue to not
collaborate with the destruction of breeding
sites of the mosquito vector [_Aedes aegypti_].
The Minister of Health, Maria Isabel Rodriguez,
confirmed that the fumigation brigades can not
carry out their work because many of the houses
that they visit are closed, for which she
acknowledged that the campaign is not producing the expected results.

The number of dengue cases increased to 1985, of
which 41 are DHF; meanwhile 749 Salvadoreans
remain hospitalized. "We are not winning the
battle against dengue," indicated the official.

The Intersectorial Health Commission (CISALUD)
will meet on Wednesday [10 Mar 2010] in order to
evaluate the epidemiological situation of the
country and correct or adopt preventive measures to reduce cases.

[This is a classical example of the need to carry
out public information campaigns before and
during the outbreak in order to not just achieve
public acceptance, but to enlist public
participation to bring the campaign down to grass roots levels.

An alarming number of dengue cases
----------------------------------
In the 1st week of March [2010], according to the
count by the Health Department, 244 suspected
dengue cases were reported on the island. We are
dealing with an alarming number, indicated the
Secretary of the agency, Dr Lorenzo Gonzalez,
taking into consideration that for the same date
in 2009 just 81 cases were reported and the rainy
season has not started. In 2008 for the same date
there were 10 cases reported and 4 confirmed,
while in 2007, when the last outbreak was
registered on the island, there were 13 cases and 6 confirmed.

The municipalities of Arecibo and Baymon are the
areas with greatest incidence with more than 20
reported cases, while in the towns of San Juan,
Yabucoa, Humacao and Juncos between 11 - 20 cases have been identified.

Until now, no dengue deaths have been reported.
"We are [now] 2 1/2 months after having detected
the outbreak and we have no people dead from
dengue and we hope to have none," said the hopeful official.

[Although the numbers in the report do not seem
to be particularly high compared to other
outbreaks going on currently in the Americas, the
abrupt increase is a valid cause for public health concern.
