Between 26 Dec and 31 Dec 2006, 86 students were hospitalized for
fever and cough in Wenxi County's Chengguan Middle School. After
treatment, sick students and teachers were all discharged from
hospital on Tue 2 Jan 2007. The exact cause of their illness awaits
evaluation by appropriate national agencies.
Xinan Zhao, Party Secretary of Wenxi People's Hospital, stated that a
total of 86 students (Note: the preceding reports mention 2 sick
teachers] were hospitalized [during the course of] the outbreak). The
hospital provided thorough symptomatic treatment and prompt
preventive care. There were no serious cases. Blood samples from
Chengguan students have been sent to appropriate national labs. To
prevent recurrence of disease, Chengguan Middle School has taken
instruction from city and county disease prevention and control
experts, and conducted thorough cleaning of each classroom and
dormitories in the school to ensure that students can return to class
as normal after New Year.

[The number of pupils and teachers affected by the outbreak has risen
from the 74 recorded on 29 Dec 2006 to the 86 recorded on 31 Dec
2006. All those affected have now been discharged from hospital. The
short duration of the outbreak and the absence of severe outcomes
suggest a mild seasonal respiratory virus infection. A final
diagnosis is awaited.
