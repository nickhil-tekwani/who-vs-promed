UK Beef-on-bone ban case collapses
Criminal charges against a Scottish hotelier who allegedly served beef on
the bone to his guests have been thrown out of court. James Sutherland, 44,
is the first person in Britain to be prosecuted under the bone-ban
regulations introduced by the government last year. However, at Selkirk
Sheriff Court in the Borders, Sheriff James Paterson ruled that the ban was
seriously flawed and could not be enforced.
The Crown has already indicated that it will appeal.
The case was brought after Mr Sutherland held a high-profile dinner for 170
farmers at The Lodge, Carfraemill near Lauder in the Scottish Borders on
December 22 last year, five days after the ban was imposed. The ban had been
announced by the Agriculture Secretary, Dr Jack Cunningham, amid protests
from farmers and butchers. The government said the move followed advice from
its scientific experts that there is a possible risk of Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy or "mad cow disease" being transmitted through bone marrow.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said if butchers broke the
ban, penalties of up to Â£1,000, and or six months in jail, could be imposed
under the Food Safety Act.
But the Agriculture Secretary insisted the dismissal of the case against Mr
Sutherland made no difference to the regulations which would remain in
place. In a statement issued after the case was dismissed Dr Cunningham
said: "This case turned on a legal technicality, the regulations are
essential for the protection of public health and they remain in force."
Shadow agriculture minister Michael Jack said the court decision threw the
Government's beef-on-the-bone policy into a "state of chaos". "We told the
government before Christmas that these regulations were unenforceable and
unnecessary. Today's court decision vindicates our judgment. These measures
were hastily thought out and clearly badly drafted. This decision throws
this whole measure into a state of chaos."

Delay on scheme to end British beef ban
By David Brown
THE Government's new computerised cattle tracking system based at
Workington, Cumbria, which aims to make British beef acceptable again in
Europe, will come on stream on Sept 28, eight months behind schedule, Jack
Cunningham, Minister of Agriculture, said yesterday.
The system will keep a record of the birth, movement and death of cattle,
and cost the taxpayer 35 million [British pounds to set up and run in its
first full year.
Although farmers' leaders and the Government have fulfilled all of Europe's
requirements to ensure the safety of British beef after the BSE outbreak and
to pave the way to a lifting of the export ban, they face strong resistance
until the computerised system is operational. The Agriculture Ministry said
the delay was due to the inclusion and enhancement of the current cattle
passport system, which is based on paperwork, in the new system. Ian
Gardiner, of the National Farmers' Union said: "It is all very frustrating".
