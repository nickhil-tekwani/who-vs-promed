[The outbreak in Beijing continues with 7 newly confirmed cases attributed to the outbreak. The 1st case in Beijing was reported on 11 Jun 2020; as of 29 Jun 2020, there have been 325 cases reported from Beijing, 21 in Hebei, and 3 in Liaoning, most likely associated with this outbreak.

There were 4 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals and 3 new conversions from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, there have been 28 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infections reported by China.

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with the SARS-CoV-2; many of whom are detected as asymptomatic at the time of positive PCR testing. Cases are still being confirmed in Beijing, and now Shanghai warrants monitoring.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 43 cases with no new deaths, compared with 42 cases and no new deaths in the previous day (28 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 79 consecutive days. There were 23 locally transmitted cases: Gyeonggi (7), Seoul (6), Daejeon (5), Gwangju (3), Gangwon (1), and Chungbuk (1), and 20 imported cases -- airport quarantine (13), Incheon (3), Seoul (1), Busan (1), Sejong (1), and Gyeongbuk (1). There were 6 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases.

According to data from the "ncov" website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the cumulative rate has been 1.0% (I do not understand where the rate of 9.4% came from yesterday 28 Jun 2020) (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/).

The overall impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. But, that being said, importations are also playing a major role in the country. It would be nice to know the asymptomatic rate being detected, and the proportion of asymptomatic infections detected that go on to clinical disease.

Tabular and graphic analyses of the situation in South Korea with the addition of the 42 newly confirmed cases from 28 Jun 2020 are available at the English language page (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030), notices 403 and 404. There are analyses of the country-wide situation including the newly confirmed cases including listings of current ongoing clusters. Four of the clusters mentioned are related to religious gatherings, and 1 related to a family gathering.

Importations came from Americas (3), Europe (1), Asia excluding China (8), (Philippines 2, Bangladesh 2, Kazakhstan 2, Russia 1, Pakistan 1).

Takeaway message: Importations continue to be a challenge, and gatherings whether social or religious are key foci for enlarging clusters (unchanged from yesterday's message).

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +126 cases and +6 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (27 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was +174 cases and +22 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (78). Emilia-Romagna (6) is the only other province reporting 10 or more cases. A total of 19 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (9 provinces reported no new cases). Italy is now 55 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 39 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. For more detailed information on the outbreak, I suggest going to the source URL above.

Takeaway message: Northern Italy still warrants close monitoring, the virus is still present.

[4] Iran: 225 205 total cases, 10 670 deaths

The COVID-19 new cases and mortality in the country show an alarming increase in comparison to previous days, Health Ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari has said. "Undoubtedly, the increasing trend reflects our [weak] performance in reopening and non-compliance with health protocols, she lamented, ISNA reported on Monday [29 Jun 2020].

Over the past 24 hours, 2536 new cases of COVID-19 were identified in the country, of which 1461 were hospitalized, she stated, adding, the total number of patients in the country reached 225 205. Unfortunately, during the last 24 hours, 162 patients lost their lives, which hit the coronavirus daily deaths record since the onset of the outbreak. The total number of COVID-19 deaths in the country reached 10 670, she said. She went on to note that fortunately, 186 180 patients have recovered or been discharged from hospitals. From [26-28 Jun 2020], some 109, 125, 144 patients died of coronavirus, respectively, which shows a rising trend.

Emphasizing the need to observe health protocols and social distancing rules, especially in gatherings and public places, she said that Khuzestan, Kurdistan, West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan, Hormozgan, Bushehr, Khorasan Razavi, and Kermanshah provinces have the highest number of patients. The situation of coronavirus disease in provinces of Ilam, Lorestan, and Golestan is alarming, she warned.

In an attempt to slow down the spread of the coronavirus, the national headquarters for coronavirus fight has approved that wearing face masks in public and crowded places is compulsory. People must wear face masks indoors or in gatherings, from [5 t0 21 Jul 2020]. And if necessary, the plan will be extended until August [2020]. Using a face mask prevents coronavirus transmission up to 80 percent, Sadat Lari said.

Alireza Delavari, Tehran University of Medical Sciences vice-chancellor, said that "People's cooperation in preventing the transmission of coronavirus has decreased, and this will increase the incidence of disease and the number of hospitalizations and will cause problems for the treatment system." Referring to the increase in the prevalence of the virus, he noted that "Using a mask and observing social distancing are the most important factors in preventing corona, which is unfortunately not observed in large shopping centers, private companies, and even government offices, subways and buses.

[As of 29 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 225 205, including 10 670 deaths, an increase of 2536 cases and 162 deaths since 28 Jun 2020. 11 provinces are named as either having high case numbers (8) or "alarming situations" (3).

Takeaway message: Premature lifting of restrictions is taking its toll in Iran as is elsewhere in the world. Unfortunately many people think that lifting of restrictions means the virus has gone away and measures like mask wearing and social distancing are no longer necessary.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 681 811, including 128 783 deaths, an increase from 2 637 077 cases and 128 437 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City data not available until 30 Jun 2020 afternoon. (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Texas, Florida, Arizona, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, (US Military), North Carolina, South Carolina, and Louisiana. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All but Louisiana reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1324 to 6896.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California, New Jersey, Texas, Florida (Florida surpassed Illinois in the past 24 hours), Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona. A total of 41 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 1.7%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 43.1% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, the percentages of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay increased from week 24 (6.5%) to week 25 (7.6%), consistent with the ongoing, as yet not under control pandemic in the country.
