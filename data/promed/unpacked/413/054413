[Overall, there have been a total of 1195 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV including 510 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012.

Updating on the ongoing outbreak of MERS-CoV in Riyadh, the addition of these 5 newly reported cases brings the total number of cases reported from Riyadh since 21 Jul 2015 to 136, including 45 deaths. Of note is that 2 of the 5 newly reported cases are healthcare workers.

Now some speculation: there is a growing cluster of MERS-CoV cases in Najran. On 4 Aug 2015, there was a case in a healthcare worker in Najran who gave a history of frequent contact with camels and ingestion of raw camel's milk and no history of contact with other known case(s). On 16 Aug 2015, there was another case reported in a healthcare worker, also with no history of contact with other case(s). On 29 Aug 2015, there was a report of a newly confirmed fatal case with no history of contact with other cases, and in today's report (2 Sep 2015) above, there are now 2 newly confirmed cases from Najran, both with a history of contact with other known case(s). So the question that comes to mind is: Were the contacts mentioned in today's update above household contacts or were they health facility related and indicative of nosocomial transmission?

To see the location of Najran and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, there is a map at the source URL.

[The global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported to WHO is now 1493, including at least 527 deaths.

In the above WHO update, there were 15 newly confirmed cases including 2 deaths, and 9 additional deaths among previously reported cases that were reported in the 2-day period from 24-25 Aug 2015. Among the 15 cases reviewed by WHO, 4 had different demographics (age and/or gender and/or location reporting - cases no. 4, 11, 12 and 13 above) than listed on the same dates on the MOH website. One had been reported by the Saudi MOH as from Riyadh, possibly related to being admitted to a hospital in Riyadh.

Reviewing the information provided on each of the cases reveals that 10 of the 15 cases had mention of admission to the hospital with a known ongoing outbreak of MERS-CoV, whereas 5 others did not. Of the 5 for whom there was no mention of the hospital with an ongoing outbreak, 4 gave no history of known contact with other case(s), whereas one gave a history with 2 other known case(s).

It is interesting to see that the apparent turnaround time from suspicion of MERS-CoV infection to confirmation appears to be 2 days. What is not mentioned in the reports to date is whether suspected cases are placed in isolation/negative pressure rooms while pending laboratory results. - Mod.MPP]

[3] International Hajj preparations - media report

http://www.onislam.net/english/health-and-science/news/493019-egypt-sets-up-35-clinics-in-ksa-ahead-of-hajj.html


The Egyptian Health Ministry has established 35 makeshift medical clinics to provide healthcare services for Egyptian pilgrims during the Hajj season, expected to start on [21 Sep 2015], Youm7 newspaper reported.

"The medical clinics, located in both Mecca and Medina, comprise 350 doctors and nurses tasked with making good preparations for the reception-arrangements of the Egyptian pilgrims and providing excellent services to enable them to perform the Hajj rituals in ease and comfort," head of Egypt's Health Ministry Hajj mission Dr. Hisham Atta was quoted as saying by Youm7 on Wednesday [2 Sep 2015].

The step is considered to be a practical medical aid to KSA from one of the largest Muslim countries, which owns sizable numbers of skilled medical doctors and health practitioners.

The Egyptian Tourism Ministry announced on Tuesday [1 Sep 2015] that the 1st group of Egyptian pilgrims will be traveling to Saudi Arabia on [7 Sep 2015].

Undersecretary of the Ministry of Health for Preventive Medicine Amr Qandil told Youm7 that the ministry has launched an awareness campaign for Egyptian pilgrims to obtain vaccinations against influenza and meningitis before traveling.

Three people died of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia on Sunday [30 Aug 2015] ahead of the pilgrimage season, AFP reported.

From its side, the Indonesian government advised the country's pilgrims to be cautious in Mecca, as the MERS virus remains threatening in the area, a minister said here on Friday [28 Aug 2015].

Indonesian Health Minister Nila. F. Moeloek asked the pilgrims to avoid consuming unprocessed camel milk and taking pictures with the animals. The minister urged them not to directly go to the local hospitals if they are sick, as many of the spreading diseases occur in the health facilities. "We seriously remind [people of the danger] of the virus spread by camels known as MERS," she told a press conference at the health ministry. "Please do not drink unprocessed camel milk," Minister Nila added.

Despite no reports of Indonesian citizens being infected, the minister said that Indonesia's pilgrims are vulnerable to the virus, as most of them are of old age. Nila called on the pilgrims to take care of their health during performing their religious holy mission there. The minister also asked health officials to focus on their task in Mecca and not perform the Hajj during their mission. "The health officials aren't allowed to perform pilgrimage. They must focus on their tasks to take care the pilgrims," she said.

Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country, regularly sends over 200 000 Muslims to perform pilgrimage to Mecca annually.

[It is interesting to see that Indonesia is cautioning individuals going to Saudi Arabia not to have contact with camels, including not taking pictures with them or consuming unprocessed camel milk, and to avoid going directly to hospitals if sick. It is also interesting that there is the recognition that "most" of the Indonesian pilgrims are "of old age" and, therefore, are more vulnerable to the virus. One suspects this may be the case for more than just Indonesian pilgrims. - Mod.MPP
