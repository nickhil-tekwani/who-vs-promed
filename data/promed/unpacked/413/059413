The minister said vaccination in Macedonia should continue in order to strengthen the immunity of the population after the significant drop on vaccination coverage in 2014.

Filipce also confirmed that 2 children are treated for lung complications but are not in life-threatening conditions.

The minister made the remarks after his visit at the Neurology Clinic in Skopje.

On [2 Jan 2019], the Health Ministry in Macedonia declared the outbreak of measles in the capital of Skopje.

According to the Center for Public Health of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, an additional 3379 people fell ill to measles during the past week.

From [28 Dec 2018 - 1 Feb 2019], measles in Ukraine is now 15 095 cases - 6364 adults and 8731 children.

The highest rates of morbidity are in Lviv (a total of 2651 people: 908 adults and 1743 children), Vinnytsia (1383: 588 adults and 795 children), Rivne (1389: 457 adults and 932 children), Khmelnytsky (1058: 583 adults and 475 children) and Kyiv (1214 people: 624 adults and 572 children).

Health officials stress that only vaccination will stop the spread of disease.

The Ministry of Health of Ukraine initiated extraordinary measures to protect against measles. In January [2019], in Lviv region, a special operation was launched to increase the coverage of immunization of children aged 6 -- 18 who missed scheduled vaccinations for any reason.

Emergency measures for the immunization of children, which will begin in the Lviv region in the 2nd half of February [2019], are also planned in other regions of Ukraine. Such actions have already been supported in Vinnitsa, which is constantly 2nd only to the disease of measles among the regions of Ukraine.

According to the decision of the Oblast Commission on Technological and Environmental Safety and Emergencies in the Vinnytsya oblast, efforts have been initiated to stop the spread of the measles. With the consent of parents, children receive missed vaccinations in schools and kindergartens, and students are directed to get used to the centers of primary medical and sanitary assistance of the city heads of universities.

https://www.iflscience.com/health-and-medicine/measles-cases-in-europe-tripled-in-2018/


Last year [2018], Europe saw 82 596 new cases of measles, 3 times as many as 2017, and a staggering 15 times more than the record low in 2016. 2018 saw the highest number of people contracting the disease in Europe in a decade. The disease can be fatal, with 72 children and adults dying last year [2018] because of it, according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) report.

As many as 92% of cases come from just 10 countries. The list, in order of most to least cases, is Ukraine, Serbia, Israel, France, Italy, Russia, Georgia, Greece, Albania, and Romania. Only 6 out of the 53 countries in the WHO Europe region didn't have any new cases. A total of 61% of people that became infected required hospitalization. The WHO is urging European countries to do more against measles.

It is not just bad news. In 2017, the rate of immunization increased significantly, reaching the highest ever estimated coverage for the 2nd dose of the vaccination at 90%. And more children received the full-2 dose series on time in 2017 than in any year since 2000, when the WHO started collecting this data. But the WHO cautions being too happy about this: although the national averages are increasing, the number of cases indicates severe gaps at the more local level. And this could lead to even more severe outbreaks.

"The picture for 2018 makes it clear that the current pace of progress in raising immunization rates will be insufficient to stop measles circulation. While data indicate exceptionally high immunization coverage at a regional level, they also reflect a record number affected and killed by the disease.

"This means that gaps at the local level still offer an open door to the virus," Dr. Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO regional director for Europe, said in a statement. "We cannot achieve healthier populations globally, as promised in WHO's vision for the coming 5 years if we do not work locally. We must do more and do it better to protect each and every person from diseases that can be easily avoided."

Ukraine suffered the most from measles in 2017 due to the huge drop in vaccine coverage during the Russian invasion of Crimea and the subsequent conflict. Vaccination rates fell to 31% in 2016. In other countries, it's the antivax movements, especially ones supported by populist governments like in Italy.

The WHO suggests European nations make sure everyone has equal and timely access to the life-saving vaccines. Governments should look at who has been previously missed and make sure those groups are covered in new efforts. Campaigns should be run to strengthen people's trust in vaccines and health authorities.

https://www.jewishpress.com/news/us-news/ny/madagascar-philippines-williamsburg-see-measles-resurgence/2019/02/13/


The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on [Mon 11 Feb 2019] announced that since [1 Jan 2019] it has received reports of 101 measles cases from 10 US states, while Madagascar and the Philippines are also reporting "steep increases" in measles outbreaks.

According to Newsweek, since last week [week 4-10 Feb 2019], NYC health officials confirmed 2 new measles cases in Williamsburg and Borough Park, which brought the number Orthodox Jews diagnosed with measles since October [2018] to 67. Rockland County, NY, had 130 cases over roughly the same 5 months, with 82% of them not vaccinated, and 3% receiving one shot (the treatment requires 2 shots). Monroe County, NY, was hit by 7 cases. Orange County, NY, was also affected last year.

Of at least 204 cases recorded since the beginning of 2018, many have hit the New York State's Orthodox Jewish communities, supporters of the anti-vaccination movement. Anti-vaccine advocates target the community with misinformation, according to Vox, and the outbreaks often begin with tourists returning from Israel and other countries frequented by Orthodox Jews, which experience measles outbreaks.

Spectrum News reported recently that patient zero in the current outbreak may have been an unvaccinated American child who returned home from Ukraine and passed on the disease to 2 unvaccinated children.

A Monroe county health official stated early this month that "the important through-line that connects all [...] 7 measles cases in Monroe County--is that all 7 of them are unvaccinated."

Spectrum News reported this week that New York may soon follow California and Vermont with legislation that makes vaccinations mandatory, with medical reasons being the only exception to being vaccinated. Monroe County health dept. officials on [Tue 12 Feb 2019] stood alongside University of Rochester Medicine and Rochester Regional Health officials to urge vaccinations.

"The message that we know is proven by science and the whole weight of guidelines issued in this country to promote vaccination," said Monroe's Commissioner of Public Health Dr. Michael Mendoza. "Vaccination is known to save lives."

A spokesperson for the New York State Department of Health on [Mon 11 Feb 2019] told USA Today that thousands of unvaccinated children have so far been excluded from 29 schools and daycare centers, and vowed to "continue our aggressive, multi-pronged response, until it is clear the outbreak has been contained."

Two more unvaccinated children were diagnosed with measles [Fri 8 Feb 2019]. That brings the Clark County cases up to 53. Outside of the county, that number is 58, including 4 people in Oregon and one man in King County.

All of the measles cases in this outbreak have been traced to the same wild strain the of the measles virus from Eastern Europe.

Clark County Public Health Officer Dr. Alan Melnick said last week that he and his office have only started to try to figure out where the outbreak started. So far, they have been focused on containing it and treating people who need it.

Health Secretary Francisco T. Duque III called for a coordination meeting with several government agencies in response to the measles outbreak in several regions in the country.

"The Department of Health is working side by side with other government agencies in quickly responding to mitigate the Measles outbreak. This government is conducting a massive information dissemination and immunization campaign to encourage Filipinos to get vaccinated. Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and your community", Secretary Duque said.

The health chief revealed that vaccination activities will be done in schools and communities until March [2019], and expects that cases will start to decrease by that time as the number of susceptibles will have already been vaccinated come March [2019]. Adults who want to be vaccinated against measles can go to any health center.

To address the measles outbreak in the country, a measles fast lane in all DOH hospitals will be established, a checklist for LGUs and consent forms will be developed and coordination with the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) will be initiated to inform LGUs of their targets. The DILG will request the LGUs to extend their immunization schedules beyond regular working hours and possibly even on Saturday and Sunday.

The Department of Social Welfare and Development will involve the day care workers for the vaccination of their pupils, while the Department of Education will gather data on how many school children were affected with measles, coordinate with the health center for absent pupils and do follow-up on school children opting to be vaccinated by a private practitioner.

The Department of Transportation, on the other hand, will assist in distributing vaccines , while the Armed Forces of the Philippines will deploy medical personnel in geographically isolated depressed areas or in conflict areas, monitor cases in military treatment facilities and ensure the safety of health workers.

https://elevenmyanmar.com/news/over-240-laboratory-confirmed-cases-of-measles-in-yangon


Between [1 Jan and 4 Feb 2019], there were 248 laboratory-confirmed cases of measles, out of 268 people under supervision for measles, according to a press meet on measles-rubella vaccination program in 7 townships in Yangon held at Yangon Region Public Health Department on [13 Feb 2019].

The number of measles cases is relatively high compared to 646 laboratory-confirmed cases of measles in the whole of 2018, said Dr. Tun Myint, deputy director-general of Yangon Region Public Health Department.

Dr. Aung Naing Oo, assistant director of the Central Extended Immunization Division under the Public Health Department (Nay Pyi Taw) said: "From [1 Jan to 4 Feb 2019], there were 437 patients suspected of being infected with measles. The department has conducted laboratory tests on 276 patients. No laboratory result has been received; 13 patients have been laboratory-confirmed that they are very similar to the symptoms of measles. There is no report causality."

An epidemic of measles breaks out in 7 townships in Yangon. Of 268 patients, South Dagon Township topped the list of cases with 32 patients, followed by Shwepyithar Township with 28, Insein Township with 21, Dagon Seikkan Township with 20, Hlaingthayar Township with 16 , Mingaladon Township with 7 and East Dagon Township with 6.

From [17 - 28 Feb 2019] the Ministry of Health and Sports will vaccinate for measles all the children aged between 19 months and 15 years,.

Last year [2018], there were 1276 measles patients nationwide. A total of 646 cases (accounting for 50% of the nationwide cases) were reported in Yangon Region and 75% of patients were below 15 years of age. This is because the coverage of the regular immunization program hit less than 90% every year and the coverage of collective immunization program in 2017 with 85% .

Myanmar has been carrying out the collective immunization against measles and rubella since 2015. Since 2018, the spread of measles are reported in the globe. The outbreaks of measles are found early in Yangon, Shan and Kayin where there was no full coverage of regular and collective immunization.

More than 100 children in Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC] have died of measles since the start of the year [2019], an outbreak that has added to deadly epidemics of cholera and Ebola, the UN said on [Wed 13 Feb 2019].

Health officials in the southeast provinces of Lualaba and Lomami recorded 7175 cases of measles in January [2019], "at least 137 of which were fatal," the UN's MONUSCO peacekeeping mission said. More than 80% of the fatalities were children aged under 5, it said.

Experts have blamed lack of vaccination, poor medical facilities and malnutrition among the young.

MONUSCO added that 1936 cases of cholera had been recorded since the start of the year [2019] in Katanga, Lomami and Tanganyika.

Lack of clean drinking water, sanitation and medical care were hampering the fight against the disease, it said.

"We don't speak about these 2 epidemics very much" yet they are "also very worrying and deadly," said the report.

[This is a tragedy on top of the Ebola outbreak where more than 500 deaths have been recorded, of which approximately 100 are children. The high fatality rate in children from measles is likely the problem of getting the vaccine to them with all the civil unrest, and the recovery is exacerbated by malnutrition. - Mod.LK]

A total of 144 cases of measles in the Kasserine region, 66 cases in Sfax and isolated cases in other regions were recorded up to [Wed 13 Feb 2019], by the services of the Ministry of Health; ie 200 cases in total.

Six deaths of babies have been deplored. Their death is linked to their altered health status before they were infected with the virus, the ministry said in a statement.

The Ministry of Health epidemic follow-up called for consultation of doctors in case of symptoms, especially in babies. Patients must be isolated from the rest of the family even in doctors' waiting rooms. Schoolchildren must stay at home for a minimum of 5 days from the onset of the 1st symptoms.
