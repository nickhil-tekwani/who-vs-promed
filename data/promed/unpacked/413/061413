The United Evening News yesterday reported the first case of inland dengue
fever this year. An additional 60 plus cases have been contracted
overseas. According to the Department of Health (DOH), [a dengue virus]
currently is circulating and they have taken preventive measures, but this
unexpected case of inland contamination is cause for particular worry.
The victim, 29, checked into a Kaohsiung hospital on Aug. 11, suffering
from fever, rash, headache, and swollen joints. After the hospital reported
the case to the DOH, more extensive lab reports determined the patient was
from inland Taiwan. The DOH told reporters that most cases were contracted
in southeast Asian countries such as Singapore and Thailand, but the source
of this case is Taiwan itself, which is why they are being especially
cautious. The patient had apparently not left the county in a while, and
DOH officials failed to find any trace of dengue fever-carrying mosquitoes
in the Kaohsiung area. Due to the patient's frequent visits to other
counties, the DOH reported that the mosquitoes could be anywhere.
