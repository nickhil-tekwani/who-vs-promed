[1] Cholera - Central African Republic
Date: Sat 1 Oct 2011

A new cholera epidemic has hit the Central African Republic and has
already claimed at least 10 victims in the south, health minister
Jean-Michel Mandaba said Fri 30 Sep 2011. His comments came the day
after a health services source sounded the alarm that cholera had
killed 6 people in the Limbo region, 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the
capital Bangui.

"The government of the Central African Republic would like to
officially declare that there is a cholera epidemic in the (southern)
health zones of Ombella-Mpoko and Lobaye, leaving at least 10 people
dead," Mandaba said. The minister called for calm and urged the local
population to go about their usual business while "scrupulously
respecting basic hygiene and cleansing measures."

[2] Cholera - Somalia (Mogadishu)
Date: Sat 1 Oct 2011

Cholera has killed 50 more children in the Somali capital Mogadishu,
where cases of waterborne diseases have increased due to unhygienic
living conditions, Press TV reports. Doctor Ali Hashi Yusuf told the
Press TV correspondent in Mogadishu that the victims died on Saturday
evening, 1 Oct 2011 in Mogadishu's southern districts of Hawlwadig and
Hodan.

More than 330 people suffering from cholera and waterborne diseases
also flocked hospitals in southern Mogadishu to get medication. A
combination of poor sanitation conditions, scarcity of safe and clean
drinking water, and overcrowding has led to the spread of waterborne
diseases in Mogadishu.

According to the World Health Organization, 75 percent of all cases of
highly infectious diarrhea in Somalia are among children under the age
of 5.

Cholera is confirmed in the Banadir, Bay, Mudug, and Lower Shabelle
regions of Somalia, and the number of acute diarrhea cases has
increased dramatically over the past few months.

Reports reaching Ogaden Online service desk from the town of
Qabridahare [Kebri Dahar, Somali Regional State] confirm the outbreak
of cholera in the area. Many people have died as a result of this
outbreak of cholera. The signs of cholera were evident in the city for
the past couple of days, however locals, due to their limited health
knowledge and lack of presence of medical personnel in the city,
thought the symptoms were not cholera.

It is reported that civilians numbering between 10 and 15 have so far
died due to the cholera outbreak. There are hundreds of civilians
still down with early signs of cholera. So far there are no reports of
aid either from the Ethiopian government or military stationed in and
around the city.

people in the past few months. Health commissioner Shehu Sambawa
announced that 6 deaths from cholera in Koko [Kebbi state] in the past
2 weeks that infected 182 people.

Rainy seasons are generally responsible for the occurrence of the
disease in Nigeria. The country's senate started an investigation to
determine what causes the repeated outbreaks of cholera.
