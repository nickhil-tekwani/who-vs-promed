Novel coronavirus infection - update 6 Mar 2013
-------------------
The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has informed WHO of a new confirmed case of infection with the novel coronavirus (NCoV).

The patient, a 69-year-old male, was hospitalized on [10 Feb 2013] and died on [19 Feb 2013]. Preliminary investigation indicated that the patient had no contact with previously reported cases of NCoV infection and did not have recent history of travel.

To date, WHO has been informed of a global total of 14 confirmed cases of human infection with NCoV, including 8 deaths. Of the total number, 7 cases, including 5 deaths, have been reported from Saudi Arabia.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States (MS) to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. WHO is currently working with international experts and countries where cases have been reported to assess the situation and review recommendations for surveillance and monitoring.

All MS are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with NCoV along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.

[As stated above, the current total number of confirmed cases of illness associated with infection with the novel coronavirus (nCoV) is now 14, of which 8 had a fatal outcome, a case fatality rate (CFR) of 57 percent. As the total number of confirmed cases to date is small (14), the observed CFR of 57 may be a reflection of non-confirmation of milder illness associated with infection with this nCoV.

The breakdown of cases (and deaths) by country of report is:
- Saudi Arabia: 7 (5 deaths)
- Jordan: 2 (2 deaths)
- UK: 4 (1 patient from Qatar - under treatment, 3 patients from UK - one with history of travel to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan prior to illness; 1 under treatment, 1 recovered, 1 death)
- Germany: 1 (patient from Qatar - discharged).

More information on the epidemiologic investigation surrounding this case's potential exposures, such as animals, including bats, would be greatly appreciated.
