The doctors of the King George Hospital (KGH) confirmed that the potential anthrax in the tribals of Panasaputtu village of Pathakota panchayat [local self-government council] in Hukumpeta mandal of agency area [Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh], who were admitted to the hospital with symptoms on [Wed 27 Apr 2016], was a false alarm.

According to Collector N Yuvaraj, after carrying out routine screening tests, the hospital authority have clarified that all the 13 tribals were not infected with anthrax [bacterium]. However, the blood samples of the patients have been sent to the labs in Pune for testing. Moreover, medical teams have also been sent to Panasaputtu village to identify people with similar symptoms.

Meanwhile, the veterinarians of the Animal Husbandry department, who collected samples (body fluids) from the village animals and conducted screening tests, have confirmed that the animals were not infected as well. However, for conducting advance tests, the samples have also been sent to Veterinary Biological Research Institute, Hyderabad.

"We have invited experts from Punjab to conduct more screening tests in Panasaputtu and its surrounding areas. They are expected to arrive on [Fri 29 Apr 2016]," the collector said.
