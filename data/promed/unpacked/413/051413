According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday morning [Apr 16 2018], 2 patients in Singapore had been infected with a _Listeria_ strain similar to [one causing] an outbreak in Australia tied to rockmelons.

One patient has recovered while the other died for reasons not due to the _Listeria_ infection, the ministry said. MOH said its National Public Health Laboratory had completed genetic sequence analysis on _Listeria_ bacteria strains obtained from the 5 patients who had _Listeria_ disease this year [2018].

Australia's rockmelon _Listeria_ outbreak killed 7 people and caused one miscarriage between [17 Jan and 6 Apr 2018], the World Health Organization (WHO) said last week. The deaths were linked to the consumption of rockmelons contaminated with _Listeria_. The rockmelons were exported to at least 9 countries, including Singapore, the WHO said.

Singapore's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority on Mar 8 announced a recall of all rockmelons from Australia as a "precautionary measure". At least 2 consignments of rockmelons, which were traced to a specific Australian grower said to be implicated in the outbreak, were sold in Sheng Siong stores and wet markets.

In a statement on [12 Mar 2018], MOH said that one case of listeriosis at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) was not linked to the consumption of rockmelons. It added that up to [12 Mar 2018], there had been no reported cases of listeriosis linked to the consumption of rockmelons in Singapore. MOH had also informed doctors to refer suspected cases of listeriosis for testing and treatment and to notify MOH of suspected cases.

On [Mon 16 Apr 2018], MOH said that initial epidemiological investigations were conducted on 5 patients in Singapore who had _Listeria_ disease this year [2018]. "There is no further public health risk from the Australia outbreak as the risks have been mitigated through the recall of the implicated consignments in March 2018," MOH said. "We will continue to monitor the situation closely."

_Listeria_ is a bacterium, which causes listeriosis, a form of food poisoning that is treatable with antibiotics if diagnosed early. Symptoms include fever and muscle aches, preceded by diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal symptoms that appear within 70 days after consumption of the contaminated food item.

Singapore identified a _Listeria_ bacteria strain similar to the one that a patient had contracted in the deadly outbreak in Australia this year [2018], Singapore's Ministry of Health said on [Mon 16 Apr 2018].

The ministry said in a statement that its National Public Health Laboratory has completed the genetic sequence analysis on bacteria strains taken from 5 patients who had listeriosis this year [2018].

The ministry found that 2 of them were infected by the _Listeria_ strain ST240, which had a similar gene sequence to the strain found in a patient in the Australian listeriosis outbreak.

One of the patients has recovered while the other died "for reasons not due to the _Listeria_ infection," it added.

Rockmelons contaminated with the listeriosis bacteria were exported from Australia to at least 9 countries including Singapore, where the affected rockmelons were recalled and destroyed by the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority in March [2018].

"There is no further public health risk from the Australia outbreak as the risks have been mitigated through the recall of the implicated consignments in March 2018," it said.

The ministry added that it will continue to monitor the situation closely.

[Genetic testing of isolates from 5 patients with listeriosis in Singapore confirmed that the genotype from 2 Singapore patients matched that of the strain causing the rockmelon (cantaloupe) outbreak in Australia.

From 17 Jan 2018 through to 6 Apr 2018, 20 cases of listeriosis in Australia (19 confirmed and 1 probable) were associated with the consumption of rockmelons (cantaloupe) from a single grower in the Australian state of New South Wales. All of the cases were hospitalized and there have been 7 deaths and 1 miscarriage associated with the outbreak. The contaminated rockmelons were also distributed to 9 countries (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (China), Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain) and perhaps the Seychelles.

Australia recalled the implicated rockmelons on 27 Feb 2018. Export details were provided though the International Network of Food Safety Authorities (INFOSAN) to the affected countries to enable them to take appropriate management measures including local recalls and risk communication. All the affected countries had been notified by 9 Mar 2018. The news report above says that Singapore recalled and destroyed the imported rockmelons in March 2018.

The news report above says that the genotype of _Listeria_ isolates from 2 cases in Singapore match that of the outbreak strain in Australia. A prior ProMED-mail post (Listeriosis - Singapore: Australian rockmelons, NOT 20180310.5678316) referred to one case in Singapore, which health authorities reported was not linked to the contaminated rockmelons from Australia. No other cases of listeriosis are known to be linked to the imported rockmelons in the affected countries, but, due to the long incubation period of listeriosis (up to 70 days), further outbreak cases may yet be reported. - Mod.ML
