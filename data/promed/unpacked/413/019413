An outbreak of mumps that has affected more than a dozen people at the State University of New York [SUNY] at New Paltz has spread to the town's high school and could possibly reach even further, according to the school's latest health update. Since early October [2016], 16 people, including at least 8 members of the swim team at SUNY New Paltz and one athletic staff member, have come down with the mumps, a highly contagious viral disease. The [Ulster] county health department has an additional 8 probable cases.

According to the school, one of the students afflicted with the condition, which is characterized by fever, headache, and swelling of the salivary glands, had been in close contact with a student at the New Paltz High School, and now the high school student has been diagnosed with a probable case of mumps. The high school student has been in close contact with a student at the New Paltz Middle School, and though the younger student does not have the mumps at this time, staff and parents at both secondary schools are being warned their children may have been exposed.

SUNY New Paltz said it has been in touch with the school district and has offered to provide assistance as needed. Upcoming Thanksgiving [24 Nov 2016] travel and gatherings compound the possibility for the mumps outbreak to spread.

After a person is exposed, symptoms usually appear 16-18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12-25 days after infection. Mumps can't be treated. Aside from headache, other symptoms include low-grade fever, fatigue, muscle aches, and loss of appetite.

The disease is transmitted by close contact, sharing utensils and drinking glasses, and through saliva contact by kissing or other means. Health officials recommend washing hands frequently as a preventative measure.
