A tick bite has already [resulted in the death of] a woman in Guilford
County and 3 cases [of tick bites] have been reported.
CDC (the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) recommend saving
the tick (once it has been pulled out) on an index card: first, put the
tick on a piece of tape, then, put the tape on an index card and write the
date down. If a rash appears, take that card to your doctor. They can test
the tick to see what you might be infected with.

[In the USA, the middle Atlantic states remain the major area for human
cases of RMSF. The vector in this area is usually the dog tick,
_Dermacentor variabilis_. Prompt recognition and removal of feeding female
ticks will generally prevent infection and prompt recognition and treatment
will prevent mortality. It should be recalled that inadvertent treatment
with sulfonamide antimicrobials exacerbates rickettsial infections.
The location of Guilford County, North Carolina, in the north central part
of the state, with Greensboro as its county seat, can be found on the map
