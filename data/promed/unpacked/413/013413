News
New health area infected with Ebola virus in Ituri
--------------------------------------------------
- A new health area has been affected by Ebola virus disease in Ituri. This is the Maroro health area in the Nyakunde health zone;
- indeed, Nyakunde was already at 294 days without notifying a new confirmed case of the EVD and returned to zero following this new infection;
- of all the 6 cases reported this Sun 13 Oct 2019, none of them were listed as contact, nor monitored regularly, nor vaccinated;
- it is also reported that the alerts of all these cases are coming back from the community and their contacts are being listed, the investigations are continuing, the decontamination of the patients' households is being carried out and the ring of vaccination has been opened around all these cases.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 237 632 people have been vaccinated;
- the only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 20 May 2018.

Monitoring at entry points
--------------------------
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of checked travelers (temperature measurement) at the sanitary control points is 105 518 454;
- to date, a total of 111 entry points (PoE) and sanitary control points (PoCs) have been set up in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri to protect the country's major cities and prevent the spread of the epidemic in neighboring countries.

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Tue 15 Oct 2019. Democratic Republic of Congo: Ebola virus disease - external situation report 63
[WHO/AFRO Health Emergency Information and Risk Assessment, edited]
http://newsletters.afro.who.int/outbreak-dashboards/1abylahx3m6q720bx6nkml?email=true&a=11&p=55803966

Situation update; data as reported by Sun 13 Oct 2019
-----------------------------------------------------
In the past week, from 7 to 13 Oct 2019, 15 new confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases were reported from five health zones in 2 affected provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While it is encouraging to see another week of relatively low numbers of newly confirmed cases, these are occurring in a concentrated area where limited access and insecurity pose challenges for the response. In such environments, risks of resurgence remain very high, as do the risks of re-dispersion of cases. For example, this past week, several people who were eventually confirmed as positive for EVD sought healthcare in health zones which are no longer experiencing ongoing transmission, such as Beni.

The proportion of confirmed cases listed as contacts has decreased in the past week from 57% to 13%, the lowest since mid-January [2019]. The majority (87%) of confirmed cases in the past week had links to the Biakato Mines Health Area in the Mandima Health Zone, with the remaining confirmed cases linked to the Mambasa Health Zone. Insecure environments in both Mandima and Mambasa Health Zones can diminish response activities related to disrupting transmission chains such as contact tracing, linkage of cases, safe and dignified burials, decontamination of affected residences, and vaccination rings.

In the 21 days from 23 Sep to 13 Oct [2019], the number of affected health areas has decreased, with 22 health areas and 10 health zones reporting new cases. During this period, a total of 49 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Mandima (43%; n=21 cases), Mambasa (12%; n=6 cases) and Oicha (12%; n=6 cases).

As of 13 Oct 2019, a total of 3220 EVD cases were reported, including 3106 confirmed and 114 probable cases, of which 2150 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1806) were female, 28% (915) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (162) were healthcare workers.

Following the declaration of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 17 Jul 2019, the Director-General will reconvene the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) on 18 Oct to review and potentially update the Temporary Recommendations made, and determine if the event still constitutes a PHEIC.

Under Pillar 1, the public health pillar of the Strategic Response Plan [http://newsletters.afro.who.int/outbreak-dashboards/uln5h2lcmx4q720bx6nkml], the estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is USD 287 million, including USD 140 million for WHO. As of 15 Oct 2019, USD 65.8 million has been received by WHO, with additional funds committed or pledged.

Further resources are needed to fully fund the response through to December 2019 and into Q1 2020. Under Pillar 5, the Regional Preparedness pillar [http://newsletters.afro.who.int/outbreak-dashboards/mjdqg66urjdq720bx6nkml], the funding requirement for all partners is USD 66 million, of which WHO requires USD 21 million. As of 15 Oct 2019, WHO has received USD 3.8 million. While some additional pledges are in the pipeline, increased funding for preparedness in neighboring countries is urgently needed. WHO is appealing to donors to provide generous support. A summary of funding received by WHO since the start of this outbreak can be found at http://newsletters.afro.who.int/outbreak-dashboards/1ojh772ydenq720bx6nkml.

[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

WHO: Insecure Ebola hot spots pose resurgence risk elsewhere
------------------------------------------------------------
In its weekly detailed analysis of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Ebola outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) said another week of low case numbers is promising, but it worries that the remaining hot spots are in insecure areas that could seed new infections to other health zones where transmission has ended.

In other developments, the DRC confirmed 3 new cases today [16 Oct 2019], putting the overall outbreak total at 3227, according to the WHO's online Ebola dashboard.

The guarded optimism paired with worries about conditions in current hot spots comes just days before the 5th meeting of the WHO's Ebola emergency committee. On 18 Oct 2019, the group will meet to discuss the latest developments and whether the situation still warrants a public health emergency of international concern under the International Health Regulations.

High risk of resurgence
-----------------------
The WHO situation report yesterday [15 Oct 2019] said most of the newly confirmed cases over the past week have occurred in a concentrated area that has limited access and insecurity problems, which pose challenges for outbreak responders. It adds that the risk of resurgence is very high in those conditions, as is the risk of transmission from the hot spots to other areas.

Underscoring the concerns, the WHO said that, over the past week, several people who tested positive for Ebola sought care in health zones that no longer have Ebola transmission, such as Beni.

Another worry is the plummeting proportion of confirmed cases who were listed as contacts, which dropped from 57% to 13% over the past week, the lowest level since the middle of January [2019], the WHO said. Over the past week, most cases had links to the Biakato Mines health area in Mandima -- which is seeing a resurgence of cases -- with the other illnesses linked to Mambasa health zone.

Insecure environments in both of the health zones can diminish response activities needed to disrupt transmission chains, such as contact tracing, safe and dignified burials, house decontamination, and vaccination, according to the WHO.

Steady trickle of new cases
---------------------------
Aside from the 3 new cases today [16 Oct 2019], the WHO's online Ebola dashboard shows that health officials are still investigating 529 suspected Ebola cases.

Another 3 people died from their Ebola infections, lifting the fatality count to 2153.

Meanwhile, the DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) provided information on 4 cases reported yesterday. One was in Beni, and 3 were in Mandima. The group also said that, of 3 new deaths reported yesterday, none occurred in community settings, a factor known to raise the risk of transmission.

[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

As Ebola cases climb, launch of 2nd vaccine in works
----------------------------------------------------
Over the weekend [12-13 Oct 2019] and through today, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) reported 10 more Ebola cases, including one in a newly affected area in a health zone that hadn't reported a case for several months, according to official sources.

In other outbreak developments, health officials in the DRC said a 2nd vaccine against the virus--the one made by Johnson & Johnson -- will be launched in November [2019].

Virus reappears in earlier affected area
----------------------------------------
Of the 10 newly confirmed cases, 6 were reported yesterday [13 Oct 2019], an increase compared with the past several days, when cases averaged just 1 or 2 per day.

The DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) in its daily report yesterday said that, of the 6 cases, 2 were in Beni and 2 in Kalunguta. Mandima and Nyakunde each reported a single case. The CMRE said the case in Nyakunde health zone in Ituri province is in the Maroro health area, which is newly affected. The new case in Nyakunde marks a reappearance of the virus in that health zone, which had gone 294 days without a new infection.

In another worrisome sign, the CMRE said none of people confirmed in yesterday's [13 Oct 2019] 6 cases were on known contact lists.

In a report from 12 Oct 2019, the CMRE said both newly confirmed cases were in Mandima. And today the World Health Organization (WHO) online Ebola dashboard notes 2 new cases, bringing the overall outbreak total to 3220.

Health officials are still investigating 383 suspected Ebola infections.

Since 11 Oct 2019, 4 more deaths from Ebola were reported, raising the fatality count to 2150.

Launch of J&J vaccine
---------------------
In its 12 Oct 2019 daily update, the CMRE said the 1st batch of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which will include 500 000 doses, will arrive in the DRC on 18 Oct 2019 and vaccination will begin in November [2019] in 2 parts of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province. The campaign will eventually extend to other provinces.

The CMRE added that the vaccine will target the part of Goma that borders Gisenyi in Rwanda. According to earlier reports, tens of thousands of people cross that border area each day. Also, according to earlier reports, Rwanda was in the process of acquiring doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to vaccinate traders who work along the Rwandan-DRC border.

In April [2019], a WHO vaccine advisory group recommended adding the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, a prime-boost product known as Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN, as a way to increase supply and test the effectiveness of a 2nd vaccine. The vaccine, designed to afford longer-lasting protection, is given in 2 doses 56 days apart.

DRC health officials green-lighted the use of the vaccine in September [2019].

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires 2 doses to be fully protective. It may be logistically difficult to follow-up with individuals to administer the 2nd dose. This is one of the reasons there is currently a large measles outbreak in the DRC. But it will be good to test this 2nd vaccine for efficacy in the field. - Mod.LK

According to Tristan Le Lonquer, head of mission in charge of emergencies within this international body, the new vaccine Johnson & Johnson grants a strong immunity than the [Merck vaccine].

"The 2-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine offers a broader immunity than the Merck, that is, Johnson & Johnson protects against other strains of the Ebola virus disease." he said Tue 15 Oct 2019.... from https://7sur7.cd/2019/10/16/rdc-ebola-le-nouveau-vaccin-accorde-une-forte-immunite-que-lancien-msf

https://www.afro.who.int/news/speeding-detection-slow-down-ebola-smartphone-app-game-changer-contact-tracing-hotspots

Speeding up detection to slow down Ebola: Smartphone app is game-changer for contact tracing in hotspots in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standing in front of her house, [KK] chats with [LK] as if they are old friends. [LK] shows [KK] something on her mobile phone that makes her smile. Then [LK] lends a hand as [KK] hangs out her laundry.

No one around them seems suspicious of [LK].

The only sign that she may be more than a friend comes when she takes [KK's] temperature. By the time [LK], a contract tracer working for the Ebola response, reaches the next household on her list, her supervisor sitting a few kilometres away in the health zone central office can already see [KK's] temperature reading and other vital information.

Until recently, following up with people who have come into contact with Ebola was a complicated task for contact tracers like [LK], working in one of the epicentres of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where suspicion can quickly reach a fever pitch.

"We used to use paper, filling out a form each day for every contact," she explains. "Then at the end of the day, we took the papers to our supervisors, who alerted the doctor if one of the contacts had signs of Ebola. It took a long time."

"Another big problem for me was security," adds [LK]. Walking around carrying a folder of documents draws the attention of the contacts' neighbours, especially in a neighbourhood in which many people are suspicious of any official intervention.

Community resistance has been particularly strong in Mabolio [Beni, North Kivu]. This has hindered the response. "Sometimes when I was carrying papers, I would be chased away," says [JBK], another contact tracer, "and then I wouldn't be able to go back for days."

Now, [JBK, LK], and other contract tracers only need to carry their mobile phone. The information they gather can be sent to their supervisor straight from the field. This is thanks to Go.Data, a mobile application that the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced in Beni on 1 Sep 20198.

Created by the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) group, WHO and partner organizations, Go.Data is a major innovation in outbreak investigation tools for field data collection. "It is particularly focused on case and contact data collection and management," says Armand Bejtullahu, the project leader at WHO and one of the chief architects of the tool. "This allows the software to produce outputs, such as contact follow-up forms and dynamic visualization of chains of transmission."

The biggest impact of Go.Data, according to Bejtullahu, is speed. Epidemiologists can access the data almost in real time, enabling them to act quickly.

Time matters
------------
Time is vital in bringing an outbreak under control. The faster a potential Ebola case is identified and brought in for treatment the greater is the chance of survival for the patient, and the less chance there is for contamination and for the disease to spread to others.

As well as speeding up contact tracing, Go.Data helps field teams make sure contacts are not lost. Sometimes, contact tracers are not able to visit all their contacts, perhaps because insecurity in the area prevents them from accessing a household or because of other issues. "When a contact is missed," says Dr Papy Musakasombo, the head of the Mabolio health zone, "we can see that early enough to do something about it that same day."

For the contact tracers, using a phone means they are less likely to encounter problems in the community. "Everyone has a mobile phone," says [JNK], who is [LK's] supervisor. "It's much more discreet and easier than carrying around a lot of paper forms." It also helps the contact feel at ease, he adds.

For epidemiologists, the visual representation of the transmission chain created by the Go.Data software is particularly valuable. It allows them to understand more easily and comprehensively how the disease spreads: which activities, environments and types of interaction are associated with high or low transmission rates. This means they can tailor the intervention to more quickly interrupt the spread.

Go.Data is already making a difference in Beni. WHO next plans to roll out the software in other Ebola hotspot areas in the DRC. The software was not designed only for Ebola, however. It can be used in any outbreak with human-to-human transmission.

"The Ebola outbreak in the DRC is our major priority," says Bejtullahu. "Going forward, hopefully Go.Data can really revolutionize the way we tackle epidemics everywhere."

One of the 1st to be trained to use the software, [LK] hopes to teach others in Beni and further afield on using Go.Data. "I am proud of the work I do," she says. "I want to help reach even more people."

- Mon 14 Oct 2019. Wildlife surveillance
[NY Times, abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/health/ebola-gorillas.html
[Byline: Donald G. McNeil Jr.]

Carrion flies inside your hood. Sweat turns your gloves into water balloons. This is tough work, but it could predict disease outbreaks. The worst part of sampling a dead gorilla for Ebola, said Dr William B Karesh, is the flies.

"You can imagine the sense of panic," he said. "A hundred thousand ants and carrion flies are coming off the carcass or climbing up your arms. They get inside your hood and are crawling on your face or biting you.

"After half an hour, you have to get out and pull off the hood, clean up and disinfect. It's not for the faint of heart."

The task described by Dr Karesh -- a former chief field veterinarian at the Wildlife Conservation Society, which runs New York's zoos -- was part of an unusual research project. Scientists were trying to predict human Ebola outbreaks by detecting them first in apes and other forest animals.

The team recently published a study in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B [see reference below] detailing 12 years of this work in the Republic of Congo.

In some ways the study, which lasted from 2006 to 2018, was a failure. Only 58 samples were gathered from dead animals, and none was positive for Ebola. Therefore, the team's hypothesis -- that animal sampling could be an early warning system for human outbreaks -- was not proved.

The good news, however, was that there was no epidemic. From 1994 to 2003, there had been multiple human outbreaks of Ebola in the Republic of Congo or neighboring Gabon. Weeks or months before each one, dead gorillas and chimpanzees were reported, sometimes hundreds of them. (Those die-offs contributed to the classification of western lowland gorillas as critically endangered.)

Sarah H Olson, a WCS [Wildlife Conservation Society] wildlife health specialist working in the Republic of Congo and a co-author of the study, conceded that carcass surveillance had been "a massive, massive challenge." But other components of the program, she argued, were highly successful.

For example, she said, public-education teams visited hunting villages across a wide swath of the country to explain why it was dangerous to eat or even touch animals found dead. The educators also put up posters and aired radio spots.

Previously, she said, "people saw dead animals as a gift from God, food they didn't have to work for."

Abstract. Ebolavirus (EBOV) has caused disease outbreaks taking thousands of lives, costing billions of dollars in control efforts and threatening great ape populations. EBOV ecology is not fully understood but infected wildlife and consumption of animal carcasses have been linked to human outbreaks, especially in the Congo Basin. Partnering with the Congolese Ministry of Health, we conducted wildlife mortality surveillance and educational outreach in the northern Republic of Congo (RoC). Designed for EBOV detection and to alert public health authorities, we established a low-cost wildlife mortality reporting network covering 50 000 km2 [about 19 300 sq mi]. Simultaneously, we delivered educational outreach promoting behavioural change to over 6600 people in rural northern RoC. We achieved specimen collection by training project staff on a safe sampling protocol and equipping geographically distributed bases with sampling kits. We established in-country diagnostics for EBOV testing, reducing diagnostic turnaround time to 3 days and demonstrated the absence of EBOV in 58 carcasses. Central Africa remains a high-risk EBOV region, but RoC, home to the largest remaining populations of great apes, has not had an epidemic since 2005. This effort continues to function as an untested early warning system in RoC, where people and great apes have died from past Ebola virus disease outbreaks.

[Byline: Fabian Schmidt ]

New Ebola vaccine brings hope to DR Congo
-----------------------------------------
Many in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been waiting for this moment: A new vaccine to battle the Ebola outbreak is about to be released. It could reach broader parts of the population than earlier attempts.

The 2nd-deadliest Ebola epidemic in the world has been raging in the Democratic Republic of Congo for over a year. More than 3200 people have been infected with the virus and, up to this week, at least 2144 people have died from the illness.

But now there are signs of progress in the battle to stop the outbreak. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that the number of reported new infections is declining. Only 14 people were confirmed in the 1st week of October [2019] -- making it the lowest number in a year. At the peak of the Ebola epidemic, in April [2019], the number of new infections was 126 per week.

In addition, all recently reported cases are concentrated in a relatively limited area, close to the Ugandan border. It is a geographical triangle between the cities of Mambasa, Komanda, Oicha and Mandima. The civil war raging in the affected areas, however, hinders the relief efforts of medical staff.

Vaccination for many in risk areas
----------------------------------
The cities of Beni and Goma in the south have also received positive news. From November, physicians will use a new vaccine from Johnson & Johnson that is better suited for broad-based prophylaxis than Merck's existing VSV-EBOV vaccine.

"The vaccines are very different in strategy," says Dr. Marylyn Addo. "The vaccine that is currently being used, takes effect after only 1 shot -- very quickly. The new vaccine, however, consists of 2 components that need to be administered at 8-week intervals."

Addo, an infectious disease expert researching emerging infections for the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, says: "The new vaccine is not really suitable to immunize contact-persons in the case of acute suspected or confirmed Ebola cases. It is more likely to be used in areas that are at risk. There, the whole population could be vaccinated prophylactically."

Although the new vaccine does not work so quickly, it has other advantages. "It is easier to produce and does not need to be cooled as much," she says.

While Merck's current fast-acting vaccine has to be cooled to -60 to -70 degrees Celsius [-76 to -94 deg F], the new vaccine only needs to be cooled to minus 20 degrees Celsius. "These are all advantages. In this respect, we hope that doctors can reach more people with the new vaccine," she says.

More vaccine doses available
----------------------------
Because it is easier to produce, the new vaccine will probably help vaccinate many more people. So far, around 235 000 people have been immunized with the 1st vaccine. Approximately the same number of vaccine doses are currently available.

About 1.5 million doses of the new vaccine are already available even though the vaccine is still in phase III of approval, a stage that requires the medicine to show its effectiveness. "This is, of course, one way to find out whether the vaccine is really effective in phase III. It has shown very good tolerability and a very good immune response. Therefore, we assume that it will also protect against the virus, but that has not been proven yet," says Addo.

That is precisely why the people living in the 4 cities affected, as well as in Beni and Goma, should be vaccinated. Residents here would otherwise have no chance of accessing vaccination because they do not belong to the circle of those who have had -- or still have -- direct or indirect contact with Ebola patients. "If you want to prepare a city for an emergency or vaccinate health workers now, this new vaccination is a good choice," says Addo.

Complete immunity to virus remains unrealistic
----------------------------------------------
If and when the Ebola outbreak is overcome, the immediate question arises: how will authorities vaccinate against Ebola in the future in order to be prepared for new outbreaks.

The problem is that Ebola is transmitted by wild animals. Since 1967, cases have occurred in a vast area of sub-Saharan Africa, from Uganda in the east to Guinea and Sierra Leone in the very far west of the continent. Almost 5000 kilometers [about 3100 mi] lie between those countries and hundreds of millions of people live in these potential Ebola risk areas. It is therefore unrealistic to expect, that the health authorities will ever be able to vaccinate every single person prophylactically. They will only be able to react to acute outbreaks.

With the 2 vaccines, they now have a better arsenal of weapons to target the virus. In addition, there are better medicines for patients who are already infected with the illness. With 2 antibody therapies, doctors have succeeded in reducing the Ebola mortality rate from 67% to 35%.

"Considering that we have only known Ebola since 1967, we have made a major step forward. And we have to build on this," says Addo confidently.

With all the fear of Ebola, says Addo, it is important to not forget about the more common infectious diseases, which cost many more lives. "We have many challenges when it comes to vaccinating. Congo is currently experiencing the world's largest measles outbreak and also a very large cholera outbreak," she says.

ref: Zastrow M. Why Japan imported Ebola ahead of the 2020 Olympics. Nature. 2019; 574(7778): 306-307
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The deadly virus is 1 of 5 that have been brought to a secure laboratory.

Japan is preparing for tens of thousands of international tourists to descend on Tokyo for the Olympic Games next year [2010] -- and that includes being ready for unwanted biological visitors.

Last month [September 2019], Japan imported Ebola and 4 other dangerous viruses in preparation for a possible outbreak at the event. The Japanese health ministry says researchers will use the samples, which include Marburg virus, Lassa virus, and the viruses that cause South American haemorrhagic fever and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, to validate tests under development.

The viruses' arrival represents the 1st time that pathogens rated biosafety-level-4 (BSL-4) -- the most dangerous rating -- have been allowed to enter the Japanese National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), the only facility in the country operating at that level.

Japan's medical-science community welcomes the move. Although infectious-disease scientists say that the risk of an outbreak during the Olympics isn't much higher than at any other time, access to the live viruses will boost the country's capacity to handle infectious diseases in general -- and to prepare for a bioterror attack.

Although the NIID's laboratory in Musashimurayama, Tokyo, was built to BSL-4 specifications in 1981, it operated as a BSL-3 lab for decades because of opposition from residents. In 2015, the health ministry and the Musashimurayama mayor agreed that it could operate as a BSL-4 lab, but the decision to import the 5 dangerous pathogens has lagged behind that of other advanced nations -- both the United States and Europe have more than a dozen BSL-4 labs in operation or under construction, and China is building a network of at least 5 BSL-4 labs, with one already operational in Wuhan.

"This is a landmark time, a landmark event" for NIID, says Masayuki Saijo, director of the NIID department that is responsible for haemorrhagic-fever viruses.

But not everyone is pleased about the imported viruses. Some local residents have told Japanese media that scientists and the government are using the Olympics as a pretext to import the viruses. And Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist and biosecurity specialist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey, says that BSL-4 labs can be prepared to handle outbreaks of hazardous agents without the need to bring them to the country ahead of time. Storing dangerous viruses, even in a highly secure lab, increases the risk of an accidental or deliberate release, he says.

What's the risk?
----------------
The NIID will use the live samples to validate tests it has developed to assess whether a person with one of the viruses is still infectious, says Saijo. The tests measure whether the patient is generating antibodies that are capable of neutralizing the virus in question, which would suggest that the patient is recovering, and not infectious, he says. If there is a person with one of these viruses at the games, such a test could provide valuable information for assessing whether they can be discharged from hospital, he says.

The development of these tests will boost Japan's preparedness for such an event or a bioterror attack, says Saijo. Other Olympic host nations didn't have to import these viruses specially ahead of the games because they already had the pathogens in BSL-4 labs. The NIID will also continue developing more sensitive and accurate tests after the games. Saijo says that he understands opposition from local residents, but that the live viruses give Japanese researchers an important advantage in preparing against infectious diseases.

Elke Muehlberger, a microbiologist at Boston University in Massachusetts, thinks that a major outbreak of Ebola at the Olympics is unlikely because the infection is not transmitted through the air. But she says that Japan's plan to assess the NIID's tests with live viruses before the games makes sense, especially given the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. "A report of an Ebola virus infection during the Olympics could have devastating consequences if the emergency responses were not professional," she says.

But Muehlberger is sceptical about the usefulness of neutralizing-antibody tests to evaluate whether a patient can be released. She says the easiest way to determine whether a patient is virus-free is to look at the amount of viral RNA in their body fluids. "I don't believe anybody would release a patient just because they have developed neutralizing antibodies," she says.

Animal research
---------------
Now that the NIID is allowed to handle BSL-4 pathogens, researchers there will also be able to study other dangerous viruses that might emerge in the region, says Muehlberger. The latest genome sequencing technologies are revealing that Ebola-like viruses are more common than previously thought, she says. 3 in the same family were discovered in animals the last year: the Mengla virus in Chinese bats and 2 Ebola-like viruses found in fish in the East China Sea. "It is amazing how many animals are infected with viruses which are very closely related to very, very dangerous pathogens," she says.

It remains unknown whether these viruses can infect or harm humans, says Muehlberger. But their diversity is "pretty scary", she says. "These viruses are everywhere."

Virologist Ayato Takada at Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan, is also excited about being able to study BSL-4 pathogens in animals in Japan. Until now, researchers had to apply for access to BSL-4 labs overseas, which are in high demand. Takada hopes to use a second BSL-4 lab that is under construction at Nagasaki University in southern Japan and due to be completed in 2022.

But Ebright argues that the proliferation of BSL-4 labs around the world increases the chances that a deadly virus could be released in a bioterror attack. He thinks that some governments, including Japan, are using their BSL-4 labs to stockpile deadly agents to deter bioattacks from similarly equipped adversaries.

Saijo says that the NIID is operated solely for public-health research.

[Air Cargo Week, edited]
https://www.aircargoweek.com/volga-dnepr-helps-control-ebola-virus-outbreak/
[Byline: James Muir]

Volga-Dnepr Group [company based in Russia, specializing in providing air freight transportation services] has assisted the Merieux Foundation's efforts to control the Ebola virus outbreak by flying mobile bio-medical laboratories.

An Antonov AN-124-100 was positioned at Lyon-Saint Exupery Airport, France on Tue 8 Oct 2019 for the foundation and its logistics partner Bioport Logistique.

The 3, 40 foot "plug and play" mobile container laboratories built in the Rhone-Alpes region belonging to the Merieux Foundation as well as a mobile lab belonging to the Praesens Foundation of Belgium flew on the AN-124-100.

The cargo was transported to Kigali, Rwanda before travelling overland to Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo where the government National Institute for Biomedical research will operate the laboratories.

The Merieux Foundation first received the call to respond to the Ebola epidemic in July [2019] and within 2 months special biosafety level 2 and level 3 containers were ready to be shipped by Volga-Dnepr.

Laboratories perform diagnostic tests and ensure biological monitoring of patients, and the containers were joined on the AN-124 by the truck-based mobile laboratory from Praesens, working in conjunction with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

Stuart Smith, global director humanitarian of Volga-Dnepr Group says: "The laboratories need to be treated with special care throughout the loading/unloading and delivery process. Our technical teams were able to perform a site visit to ensure that the laboratories were prepared for air transport. Volga-Dnepr Group operates probably the world's most unique fleet of cargo aircraft and is well placed to meet the global needs of government, NGOs, and foundations in the response to natural disasters and health crises."

- Tue 15 Oct 2019. Mathematical model
[News-Medical, edited]
https://www.news-medical.net/news/20191015/New-UCL-developed-mathematical-model-could-help-predict-next-Ebola-outbreak.aspx
[Byline: Kate Anderton]

The next Ebola outbreak could be predicted using a new UCL [University College London]-developed model that tracks how changes to ecosystems and human societies combine to affect the spread of the deadly infectious disease.

The model could help policymakers to decide where to target vaccine deployment, or develop healthcare infrastructure, to reduce the risk of zoonotic disease outbreaks -- illnesses that spread between animals and humans.

Analysis using a mathematical model, published today in Nature Communications [see reference below], shows that several countries in Africa, including Nigeria, could be at risk of Ebola outbreaks both presently, and in the future, despite having experienced no known cases to date.

1st author of the study, Dr David Redding (UCL Genetics, Evolution & Environment), said: "It is vital that we understand the complexities causing animal-borne diseases to spill-over into humans, to accurately predict outbreaks and help save lives.

"In our models, we've included more information about the animals that carry Ebola and, by doing so, we can better account for how changes in climate, land-use or human societies can affect human health."

Designed by a UCL-led team of researchers, the model captures the impact of climate, land use and human population factors on the risk of Ebola and predicts the known set of previous outbreaks with a high degree of accuracy, even in the absence of case data.

The results show that Ebola outbreaks, resulting from spill-over events, are 1.6 times more likely in scenarios with increased warming and slower socioeconomic development.

More than 2/3 of all infectious diseases originate in animals, including Ebola, Lassa fever, and West Nile virus. These diseases contribute to the global health and economic burden that disproportionately affects poor communities.

The latest Ebola epidemic has claimed more than 2100 lives since August 2018 and while there are signs it is in retreat, the risk of spread is still high according to a recent report by the UN.

The World Bank estimates that the 2014 Ebola outbreak cost the three countries most affected many billions of dollars, due to infrastructure breakdown, mass migration, crop abandonment and a rise in endemic disease due to overrun healthcare systems, among other drivers.

The team of researchers from UCL, ZSL (Zoological Society of London), Lancaster University, University of Surrey, Tulane University (USA), and University of Cambridge, used a 1st principles approach of how humans interact with wildlife and how Ebola spreads within human populations to develop the predictive framework, which could also be adapted for other zoonotic diseases.

"Importantly, our model is flexible enough to allow us to predict Ebola outbreaks in alternative, simulated versions of the world. For example, we examine a set of plausible future environments and show stark differences in how Ebola responds to the best-case and worst-case scenarios of future climate change and poverty alleviation," explained co-author Professor Kate Jones (UCL Genetics, Evolution & Environment and ZSL's Institute of Zoology) said.

Ebola risk appears to worsen in future versions of our planet that have higher climate change and worse cooperation between societies. Working together to improve healthcare resources, which can contain dangerous diseases such as Ebola, appears to strongly reduce future risk, and this offers an important option for preventing future disease cases. We hope our model will help policy makers address this challenge.

Abstract. Recent outbreaks of animal-borne emerging infectious diseases have likely been precipitated by a complex interplay of changing ecological, epidemiological, and socio-economic factors. Here, we develop modelling methods that capture elements of each of these factors, to predict the risk of Ebola virus disease (EVD) across time and space. Our modelling results match previously-observed outbreak patterns with high accuracy, and suggest further outbreaks could occur across most of West and Central Africa. Trends in the underlying drivers of EVD risk suggest a 1.75 to 3.2-fold increase in the endemic rate of animal-human viral spill-overs in Africa by 2070, given current modes of healthcare intervention. Future global change scenarios with higher human population growth and lower rates of socio-economic development yield a fourfold higher likelihood of epidemics occurring as a result of spill-over events. Our modelling framework can be used to target interventions designed to reduce epidemic risk for many zoonotic diseases.

- Tue 15 Oct 2019. Climate warming
[CNN, edited]
https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/15/health/climate-crisis-ebola-risks/index.html
[Byline: Jen Christensen]

The climate crisis is going to raise the risk that Ebola will spread farther and reach areas previously unaffected by the virus, according to a study published [Tue 15 Oct 2019] in the journal Nature Communications [see above].

The study found that the climate crisis will bring a 1.75-3.2-fold increase in the rate at which the deadly virus spills over from animals to humans by 2070.

There will be an increased risk of more devastating outbreaks in areas of Africa that haven't seen outbreaks before under all of the climate warming scenarios the researchers looked at, including if humans cut their carbon emissions significantly or only slightly. Higher temperatures and slower social and economic development would lead to greater risk.

In west and central Africa, where outbreaks have traditionally clustered, outbreaks would happen more frequently and spread farther, via airlines, to previously unaffected areas, the researchers suggested. Using the current network of airline flights in their model, the study suggests that there is a high risk of Ebola spreading to China, Russia, India, Europe and the United States.

The 1st Ebola outbreak was identified in 1976 and there have been 23 outbreaks recognized since. There's still more research to be done on exactly how these outbreaks start, but scientists suspect Old World fruit bats that carry the disease may be at least in part be to blame. They also believe contact between humans, great apes and duikers -- a small brown antelope -- may be connected to these outbreaks.

Ebola is a rare but deadly disease. It has no cure and there is no approved vaccine, although there is a concerted effort to create one. Health officials remain hopeful about an experimental vaccine that has been widely used in the current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Researchers figure Ebola outbreaks will increase due to the environmental conditions brought by the climate crisis such as higher temperatures.

Previous research has shown that climate can impact animals that carry the disease like fruit bats. If there is more rainfall -- something predicted with warming temperatures, for instance -- there will be more fruit for the bats to eat.

More fruit means more bats, that will reproduce more and also come into contact with more animals as they come together to eat this food, further increasing the likelihood that humans will come into contact with them.

Conversely, if it's a year with drought, another scenario possible with warming temperatures, farmers that can't grow enough to feed their families might have to venture farther into the forest for food, increasing the chances they will come into contact with the forest animals such as bats, that carry Ebola.

Ebola will also likely spread due to the projected human population growth and the limited health care in the African region. The authors created a mathematical model to take these multiple factors into account and determine exactly how much more frequent outbreaks will be.

Other studies have found that disease spread by animals, not just Ebola, will become more frequent due to the climate crisis and will make many more people sick. About 2/3 of human infectious diseases start with animals like mosquitoes -- and mosquitoes love a warmer and wetter climate.

The climate crisis may already be a factor in the spread of some diseases. Studies of the recent rise of the mysterious superbug _Candida auris_ connect it to the climate crisis.

In addition to the spread of Ebola, scientists predict higher temperatures will bring more cases of malaria, diarrhea, heat stress, heart defects, malnutrition, and antibiotic resistant diseases.

Ultimately, scientists believe the climate crisis could "halt and reverse" progress made in human health over the past century, experts say. The World Health Organization predicted that rising global temperatures could lead to many more deaths than the 250 000 deaths a year it predicted just 5 years ago.
