1st reports of 2 grapevine viroids in China and the possible detection of a 3rd

5 distinct viroids have been recognised in grapevine (_Vitis vinifera_) by
sequence analysis (Hadidi et al., 2003). Grapes are one of the most
important fruit crops in China and a survey was conducted during 2002-2005
to identify those viroids affecting this crop in the country.
Leaves were harvested in June from 70 samples, comprising 7 wild plants
from Liaoning, 58 varieties in a grapevine nursery in Beijing, 2 from
Xinjiang autonomous region and 3 from Hebei. Nucleic acids were extracted
(Li et al., 1995) and tested for the presence of f4 grapevine viroids by
dot-blot or northern hybridisation using digoxygenin-labeled riboprobes for
Hop stunt viroid (HSVd), Apple fruit crinkle viroid (AFCVd), Grapevine
yellow speckle viroid (GYSVd) and Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd) (Li et
al., 1995, Sano et al., 2000, Sano et al., 2004).
HSVd was detected in 41 samples, GYSVd in 29 and AFCVd in 1. CEVd was not
detected. As AFCVd has never been reported from grape and the probe shared
ca. 85 percent sequence similarity with Australian grapevine viroid (AGVd),
the latter sample seems more likely to have been infected with an AGVd-like
viroid. 23 samples were infected with both HSVd and GYSVd, and 1 with the
AGVd-like viroid, HSVd and GYSVd. This last sample had been collected from
an old grapevine in Xinjiang.
Infection in 13 samples positive by dot blot hybridisation for HSVd and 12
for GYSVd was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) using the primers 5'-TTGGATCCTCTCTTGA(G/A)CCCCT-3' and
5'-TTGGATCCGCGGCAGAGGC-3' for HSVd; and 5'TTGGATCCCACCTCGGAAGGCC(G/T)CC-3'
and 5'TTGGATCC(T/A)AACCACAGGAACCACA-3' for GYSVd1 and GYSVd2.
Identities of the viroids were confirmed by sequencing the PCR products
obtained. Infection of the sample positive when using the AFCVd probe could
not be confirmed by RT-PCR using the primers
5'-TTGGATCCTGGGCACCAACTAGAGGT-3' and 5'-TTGGATCCGGGCCTCCAAACAGGGAG-3',
which should detect AGVd. The reason for this failure is not known and at
present the identity of the viroid in this sample is uncertain.
Further work is necessary to confirm the possible detection of this viroid
or to characterize the agent detected by the AFCVd probe.
GYSVd has been reported from China previously (Hadidi et al., 2003) but
these reports seem to have been based solely on symptoms and this is the
1st report confirmed by other tests. This is also the 1st report of HSVd in
grapes in China.

[Comments on the 3 viroids:
Hop stunt viroid (HSVd):
At present it appears that HSVd is limited to Japan. Isolates of HSVd are
divided into 5 groups: 3 major groups (plum-type, hop-type and citrus-type)
each containing isolates from only a limited number of isolation hosts and
2 minor groups, presumably derived from recombination events between
members of the main groups. HSVd has been found in a wide range of hosts
including hop, cucumber, grapevine, citrus, plum, peach, pear and,
recently, apricot, almond and pomegranate. In some hosts, such as grapevine
and apricot, the infection appears to be latent but in other cases,
specific disorders such as hop stunt, dapple fruit of plum and peach and
citrus cachexia have been associated with HSVd infection. Phylogenetic
analyses revealed that sequence variants belonging to the 2 minor
recombinant subgroups are more frequent than previously thought.
Grapevine yellow speckle (GYSVd):
GYSVd is an elusive disease whose outward expression is conditioned by
climatic and possibly varietal factors. Symptoms, when shown, consist of a
few to many minute chrome yellow spots or flecks scattered over part or all
of the leaf surface or gathering along the main veins to give a vein
banding pattern
GYSVd-induced vein banding is very similar, if not identical, to the
symptoms of a disease also known by the name of vein banding, which has
long been regarded as part of the fanleaf degeneration complex. Although
vein banding may show in GFLV-free vines, it is more often associated with
GFLV infections. In fact, it has been suggested that the presence of GFLV
enhances the expression of GYSVd in the form of vein banding patterns.
Similar enhancement may occur in vines concurrently infected by grapevine
chrome mosaic virus. Unlike GFLV-induced yellow discolorations, the
symptoms of yellow fleck appear in the height of summer on a limited number
of mature leaves, and they persist for the rest of the vegetating season.
Yellow speckle symptoms may also show concurrently with symptoms of other
diseases such as, for instance, leafroll.
No vector for GYSVd is known. Natural dissemination occurs by mechanical
inoculation through surface-contaminated cutting tools during management
operations (pruning and propagation); by graft transmission: and by
distribution of infected propagating material. The absence of symptoms in
most European scion varieties and all American rootstocks greatly
facilitates inadvertent viroid dissemination, making viroid dispersal
virtually impossible to prevent. None of the grapevine viroids is known to
be seed-transmitted
Apple fruit crinkle viroid (AFCVd):
AFCVd, a graft-transmissible fruit and/or bark disorder of apple, was first
reported in Japan. I was unable to obtain information about the viroid
outside of Japan. Apple scar skin viroid (ASSVd) has 37 percent sequence
homology with GYYSVd. Both viroids share a common sequence in the central
region of the molecule, but lack the central conserved sequence of viroids
in the potato spindle tuber viroid group. Other homologous residues also
occur as blocks of base-paired residues in the secondary structures of
ASSVd and GYSVd. ASSVd viroid also has some homology with members of the
Potato spindle tuber viroid group but not with Avocado sunblotch viroid.
