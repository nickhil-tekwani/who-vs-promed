Vesiviruses: Oceanic Viruses Identified in Human Blood Samples
-----------------------------------------------
A virus of oceanic origin that can cause a range of diseases in several
animal species has been found in human blood samples. The virus, or
antibodies to it, was found most often in the blood of individuals with
liver damage or hepatitis of unknown cause related to blood exposure.
A study on these findings was published on Wed 22 Mar 2006 in the online
edition of the Journal of Medical Virology by scientists from Oregon State
University (OSU), the Center for Pediatric Research at Eastern Virginia
Medical School, and AVI BioPharma.
The association between viral infection and the presence of a disease of
unknown cause does not prove cause and effect, the researchers say, but the
data are intriguing and raise important new questions. Further research is
needed to establish proof that infection with this virus in humans is
causing liver damage or some other problems, which may include encephalitis
and spontaneous abortion.
The viruses being studied belong to the genus _Vesivirus_, one of 4 genera
in the family _Caliciviridae_. Some caliciviruses cause disease in humans,
such as [those classified in the genera _Norovirus_ and _Sapovirus_] that
cause [sudden-onset viral] gastroenteritis. Other caliciviruses cause a
wide range of disease in other animal species. The genus _Lagovirus_ causes
a fatal hemorrhagic disease and hepatitis that has killed millions of
rabbits across 4 continents in the past 20 years.
In more than 30 years of research, part of what has been found to be
unusual about caliciviruses is that they can cause multiple diseases and
affect a broad range of marine and terrestrial animal species; a single
vesivirus serotype has infected species as diverse as fish, seals,
shellfish, swine, cattle, primates and humans, the researchers said in
their report.
In the latest study on potential human impacts, scientists looked at
samples from more than 700 blood donors at a laboratory that serves 8
western states as well as some samples from patients with clinical hepatitis.
In 4 study groups, the researchers found:
(a) In blood samples from normal blood donors that had been determined to
be safe and were used in blood transfusions, 12 percent [exhibited
vesivirus] antibodies, suggesting a previous infection;
(b) in donors who had evidence of liver damage based upon a liver enzyme
test, and whose blood had been discarded as a result, 21 percent had
[vesivirus antibodies];
(c) in blood samples from persons who had been diagnosed with clinical
hepatitis, 29 percent had vesivirus antibodies;
(d) in persons who previously had transfusions or dialysis and who then
developed hepatitis of unknown cause -- meaning it was not caused by known
hepatitis types A through E -- 47 percent had vesivirus antibodies.
In separate tests that looked for actual virus in the blood rather than
antibodies, 5 percent of blood samples from normal donors revealed
vesiviruses. Among persons with evidence of liver damage, researchers found
11 percent had vesivirus-contaminated blood.
"This study clearly demonstrates that both vesiviruses and the antibodies
against them are fairly common in humans," said Alvin Smith, a professor of
veterinary medicine at OSU and one of the world's leading experts on
caliciviruses. "Vesiviruses are widely distributed in many animal species,
but this is a previously unrecognized relationship between vesiviruses and
humans."
"This research also shows an increasing prevalence of vesivirus antibody in
persons who have hepatitis of unknown cause," Smith said. "This suggests
there is a broader potential for vesivirus infection and illness in humans
than previously recognized."
Previous individual case reports have documented human disease [associated
with vesivirus infection], said Dr. David O. Matson, a co-author on the
study and physician at Eastern Virginia Medical School. "This study adds to
our knowledge of the potential for [vesivirus-associated] illness in
humans, a potential as-yet unstudied by others," Matson said. There are
assays available to test for vesivirus infection or antibodies, researchers
say, that have been developed at OSU and licensed to private industry. "AVI
BioPharma has investigated their proprietary NeuGene antisense as an
anti-vesiviral treatment and is currently conducting further research and
development," said Patrick Iversen, a co-author on the study and senior
vice president of research and development at the company.
Researchers say that vesiviruses have natural reservoirs in the marine
community, where they can replicate and recycle, infecting and sometimes
causing health problems in seals, sea lions, whales, and perhaps fish,
shellfish and other species. In general, the marine environment is "a
relatively under-explored potential reservoir of human pathogens," the
researchers said in their study.
History suggests these viruses have rarely been confined to the ocean. A
costly vesivirus epidemic in hogs 1st was identified in 1932 and was found
to be linked to uncooked fish and pork scraps fed to hogs. It's now known
that the vesiviruses -- named in part for the disease they can cause in
hogs, vesicular exanthema of swine -- are found in many other species.
In a research article published in January 2000 in the American Journal of
Veterinary Research, the same scientists found that 15 percent of the dairy
and beef cattle in 8 western states had vesivirus antibodies, with antibody
prevalence in various herds ranging from zero to 80 percent. It concluded
that vesivirus infection in cattle is widespread and in various studies has
been "associated" -- identified to be statistically relevant but not yet
proven as a cause -- with abortion, diarrhea, severe respiratory disease
and vesicular disease.
In another study to be published soon, a population of Thoroughbred mares
on horse farms in Kentucky, which was having an unusually high level of
spontaneous abortions, was also found to have 81 percent positive testing
for vesivirus antibodies, far higher than a normal population.
Because of its endemic nature and prevalence, possible sources of vesivirus
infection in humans could include meat, seafood, contaminated water,
contact exposure and blood transfusions, researchers say. Evidence suggests
that vesiviruses and other disease-causing caliciviruses are worldwide,
they said.

The family _Caliciviridae_ comprises 4 distinct genera; the genus
_Norovirus_ (formerly the "Norwalk-like viruses"), the genus _Sapovirus_
(formerly the "Sapporo-like viruses"), 2 genera which are associated with
human disease, and 2 other genera which contain viruses of veterinary
importance. The genus _Lagovirus_ contains Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus
and European brown hare syndrome virus, and the genus _Vesivirus_ contains
_Vesicular exanthema of swine virus_ (VESV), from which the genus takes its
name. The genus _Vesivirus_ comprises 2 virus species, the species VESV,
which includes also several closely related viruses isolated from marine
mammals, primates, skunks and reptiles, and the distinct species _Feline
calicivirus_.
VESV was recognized 1st in California in 1932, and by 1953 had spread to 42
states; 13 serotypes were identified, and outbreaks of disease were
associated with the practice of feeding food waste to pigs. By 1956,
however, the disease had been eradicated from the United States by vigorous
enforcement of feeding regulations and a comprehensive slaughter policy.
The stimulus was potential confusion with other clinically
indistinguishable and less easily controlled vesicular diseases of swine,
foot-and-mouth disease, vesicular stomatitis, and swine vesicular disease.
It was established subsequently that VESV and viruses isolated from ailing
sea lions inhabiting San Miguel Island, California were essentially the
same virus. Like VESV, the San Miguel sea lion viruses (SMSV), were
antigenically heterogenous, and some 17 serotypes have been identified.
Retrospective analysis suggested that the multiple serotypes of VESV had
evolved during replication of the virus in its natural host, the sea lion,
rather than in swine.
The possible relationship described above between human liver disease and
vesivirus infection is an intriguing and novel finding meriting
comprehensive investigation. - Mod.CP]
