Summary

During the 2018-2020 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu province in the Democratic Republic of Congo, EVD was diagnosed in a patient who had received the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine expressing a ZEBOV glycoprotein (rVSV-ZEBOV) (Merck). His treatment included an Ebola virus (EBOV)-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb114), and he recovered within 14 days. However, 6 months later, he presented again with severe EVD-like illness and EBOV viremia, and he died. We initiated epidemiologic and genomic investigations that showed that the patient had had a relapse of acute EVD that led to a transmission chain resulting in 91 cases across 6 health zones over 4 months.

Discussion

We describe a case of acute EVD relapse that has led to human-to-human transmission. We were able to sequence EBOV genomes in samples obtained during the patient's 1st EVD episode (sample d1) and 2nd EVD episode (sample d171), and we found that they differed by only 2 mutations. These findings indicate a relapse of the initial EBOV infection. Our time-aware phylodynamic analysis showed that between samples d1 and d171, the virus evolved at a rate that was one quarter of that in the overall outbreak; this finding indicates relapse from a persistent EBOV infection. The median TMRCA for the relapse clade of 7 Nov 2019 is an estimate of the earliest time point when the virus probably exited persistence and resumed a normal rate of replication. If we assume a presymptomatic incubation period of 2-21 days, this date is consistent with the recurrence of EVD symptoms on 25 Nov [2019] reported by the patient.

Although the underlying mechanism of relapse associated with EBOV persistence in convalescent patients remains unclear, 3 patients with documented cases of relapse (including the patient reported here) all received antibody-based therapy as part of the treatment for the initial infection. The Pamoja Tulinde Maisha (PALM ["Together Save Lives" in the Kiswahili language]) randomized, controlled trial showed the benefits of monocolonal antibody-based therapy [15]. Questions remain as to whether passive immunotherapy could, in rare instances, be associated with viral relapse, as has been historically documented in patients with Argentine hemorrhagic fever treated with convalescent plasma [16]. Two previous patients with EVD relapse were repatriated persons who had severe EVD and received aggressive supportive care along with convalescent plasma and experimental therapeutic agents [3,17,18]. Both patients recovered, and during convalescence, organ-specific inflammatory syndromes (uveitis and meningoencephalitis) developed that warranted additional treatment [3,4].

The major and very consequential distinction between our patient and previous patients with relapse is the extent of onward transmission. Our patient was symptomatic in the community for 8 days and visited 2 health-care centers. Precautions were not taken to prevent the spread of infection, and there were 29 directly linked cases of EVD. This case report provides an unfortunate proof-of-principle that survivors of EVD with relapse syndromes, like patients with acute EVD, can transmit EBOV.

To investigate why the patient was not protected from infection after his vaccination in December 2018, we tested a serum sample obtained during his initial EVD episode in June 2019 for anti-EBOV glycoprotein IgG titers, but we detected none (Table 1). Given that we found no signs of immune deficiencies, this probably was an incidence of temporal or complete vaccine failure. This finding is in line with those of other studies showing that up to 10% of patients with EVD had been fully vaccinated for at least 10 days before admission to the ETU [15]. In addition, serologic data from the Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia (PREVAIL) trials involving more than 700 participants who had received rVSV-ZEBOV showed that in approximately 20% of vaccinated persons, positive Ebola IgG binding titers did not develop one month after vaccination [19,20]. Combined, these findings arouse concerns about the true effectiveness of rVSV-ZEBOV, which has been estimated to be 100% in the Guinean "Ebola ca suffit!" trial21 and 97.5% in the preliminary report by the World Health Organization on the use of this vaccine in the DRC [22].

An alternative hypothesis for the patient's lack of protection during relapse, despite his anamnestic response, is potential viral escape during persistence. The E280G glycoprotein mutation that developed during EBOV persistence may have allowed a replication advantage or immune escape, but our data show that the mutated glycoproteins retained sensitivity to the treatment antibody mAb114. Alternatively, the mutation may simply be coincidental, and viral persistence may have arisen with infection of an immune-privileged compartment. The other noted mutation in this patient was in a noncoding region, and little is known about the effect of an intragenic region on gene expression in EBOV. Furthermore, our patient did not have overt evidence of chronic diseases associated with immunosuppression, and our whole-exome sequencing analysis did not reveal genomic variants that are known to or likely to cause primary immune deficiencies, although primary immunodeficiency cannot be fully ruled out.

During the North Kivu outbreak in the DRC, the provision of effective therapeutic agents for EVD and supportive care have helped more than 1000 patients to leave ETUs as survivors (who are aptly called "vainqueurs" or victors, in French) [15]. Despite the positive effect these countermeasures may have had on individual lives, the overall case fatality rate of approximately 66% is similar to those observed during previous outbreaks [23]. This high case fatality rate can be partially attributed to the fact that the outbreak occurred in a conflict zone, with frequent disruptions to all aspects of the outbreak response [24,25]. This case report shows the need for continued monitoring of vaccine and therapeutic interventions and the power of having locally available genomic capabilities to support the outbreak response. Relapse of EVD appears to be a rare event; however, relapse, like sexual transmission, should be recognized as a mechanism for onward transmission from persons with persistent infections. More data are needed to understand the mechanism and risk factors of EVD relapse in order to prevent future transmission events and protect patients as well as their families and communities.

[Read full publication for references and figures. This death is very sad and concerning since the patient initially apparently recovered following therapeutic treatment and was vaccinated. The sequencing results leave little doubt there was a relapse and not a reinfection. Although a rare event, this case demonstrates, as have others, it is important to maintain some level of monitoring if possible; and awareness of the possibility of relapse on the part of health-care workers and patients in order to be alert to suspicious symptoms even after apparent recovery. - Mod.LK]

B. Chronic infection - but do not panic

Ebola is back in Guinea in West Africa, 5 years after the largest Ebola epidemic ever known ended, but it has not come back the way we expected it to.

Eighteen people are reported to have been infected, of which 9 have died. Although vaccines against Ebola exist and have been rolled out, there is the fear that these small clusters of infection could ignite into something much, much larger.

What's unusual about the virus that has caused this new outbreak is that it doesn't seem to have come from an animal but from a human. The individual was probably infected during the 2014-2016 epidemic.

While Ebola is thought to be a short-term infection, this latest outbreak highlights the grave potential of longer-term infections. But do we have to now reassess everything we thought we knew about these classic acute, "self-limiting" viral infections?

Acute versus persistent

Many viral infections are acute (sudden onset) and self-limiting, that is, they resolve on their own. Think of things like the cold, flu, or measles: you'll get infected, feel lousy for a couple of days or so, and then it will clear up and you'll go back to your life. What's happening inside your body is a different story, though. In the few days following exposure, the virus gets inside your cells and replicates millions of times, which spreads the infection further through your body and can be released to transmit to another person.

This burst of infection triggers an immune response that seeks to limit onward spread. Sometimes the virus itself kills infected cells. Eventually, potent antiviral defences are produced composed of B cells and antibodies, as well as T cells. Antibodies and T cells mop up the residual infection and expunge your body of infected cells. After a few weeks, there's no trace of the original infection, and in its place, you'll have some immunity to the infection in the near future.

However, not all viruses are dispatched in such a swift manner. Some can resist the antiviral immune response and linger for years or even a lifetime. Viruses such as HIV, herpes, and hepatitis B and C are ones that cause long-term infection, and while they are at it, long-term disease. (Although it should be noted that not all long-term infections -- such as pegivirus infections -- lead to long-term disease.)

These long-term infections are known as persistent or chronic infections. Herpes viruses can cause a special kind of persistent infection known as a latent infection, where it lingers in the body for years or decades, without replicating. For a virus to survive in the face of an immune response, it must have strategies to mitigate our defences either through direct antagonism or by mutation and evasion. Also, persistent infections occur in so-called immune-privileged organs such as the brain, the eyes, and the testicles. These organs can tolerate an infection without eliciting an inflammatory immune response.

Ebola long-term infection

So what then is Ebola? Ebola viruses, of which there are 6 species, are probably bat viruses that cause what is known as Ebola virus disease (EVD) in humans and other animals. EVD comes on swiftly, causing a fever, flu-like symptoms, diarrhoea and haemorrhage, which can lead to organ failure and death. This systemic infection is characterised by a very high level of virus in the blood, organs, and bodily fluids.

Survivors of EVD can suffer debilitating long-term effects. Following the 2014 epidemic in West Africa, several discoveries were made regarding the long-term infections caused by the Ebola virus in recovered people in the eyes and male genital tract. In some circumstances, months later, recovered patients could even succumb to a 2nd episode of disease caused by the virus. What's unique about the recent resurgence in Guinea is that the length of time is greater than we had previously identified, and that, worryingly, has led to more than one infection.

How might Ebola viruses establish this long-term persistent infection? Given that they cause a large systemic infection, they probably gain easy access to immune-privileged tissues, such as the eyes or testes. In some rare cases, infection of long-lived cells in these organs combined with low levels of viral replication would be consistent with the resurgence in Guinea.

What now?

The blurring of the line between acute and persistent infections has been happening for decades. Classically acute infections have been found to establish a persistent state in some circumstances. For example, a study from 1978 found that healthy young people working at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, Antarctica, were infected with parainfluenza viruses for up to 6 months, despite being in total isolation. Parainfluenza viruses usually cause short-lived common cold symptoms. Measles, which typically runs its course in 2 weeks, can lay dormant in the brain for years before reappearing and causing a brain disorder called sub-acute sclerosing panencephalitis.

Given that we now know that some infections can resist clearance from the body, cause disease at a later date and ignite another outbreak, should we be concerned? The truth is, most acute infections are just that: acute infections. This will be especially important to bear in mind with Ebola, which has the potential for increasing the stigma faced by survivors of this terrible disease.

We can try to get rid of the persistent infection through targeted vaccination or treating survivors; trials are already underway for persistent infection treatments. We might even be able to exploit this biological phenomenon to make better vaccines that continuously dose the immune system throughout the inoculated person's lifetime.

[Persistent viral infections are a challenge, and it is important to determine how to eliminate such persistence, in this case, Ebola, to prevent transmission to naive individuals and recurrence of disease in the persistently infected individuals. In addition, persistent infection will further stigmatize already sidelined survivors. There have been 8 mini outbreaks caused by persistent virus in survivors since 2016, the most concerning over 480 days (nearly 17 months) past the initial recovery of the patient (Pleet ML, DeMarino C, Stonier SW, et al.: Extracellular Vesicles and Ebola Virus: A New Mechanism of Immune Evasion. Viruses. 2019; 11(5): 410; doi:10.3390/v11050410). While EBOV clinical latency in immune-privileged sites has not yet been well characterized, possible mechanisms are discussed in the Pleet et al. reference. - Mod.LK]

[2] Research: broadly reacting antiviral
- Tue 30 Mar 2021
[The Academic Times (abridged, edited)]
https://academictimes.com/its-almost-like-we-found-an-antibiotic-for-viruses-broad-spectrum-antiviral-targets-zika-ebola-and-covid-19/

A new antiviral drug shown to be effective both in vivo in mice and in vitro in human cell lines appears to treat more than 10 deadly viruses that currently have no commercial medication. The extensive pool contains devastating ailments such as Zika virus, dengue fever, Ebola, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and even COVID-19.

Made from the extract of a Chinese plant, the drug's multifaceted uses were identified by a group of researchers initially focused on finding treatment routes for HIV. It contains a small molecule called 6-deoxyglucose-diphyllin, or DGP, and rather than target the viruses themselves, which continuously mutate -- the usual limiting factor for virus medications -- it targets the body.

The inventor behind the drug has applied to patent the molecule's use as medication against a broad spectrum of viruses, and the application was published by the World Intellectual Property Organization on 4 Mar [2021]. Foundational research for the medication was published by the team in September 2019 in The Lancet.

The revelatory molecule, DGP, was initially sent to Felipe Diaz-Griffero, a professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and the inventor of the final drug, by a colleague who believed it could target the HIV capsid he was examining. But upon testing it, something strange happened.

"It didn't target the capsid of HIV," Diaz-Griffero told The Academic Times. "So we decided, just by chance, to see whether this drug blocks Zika. And when we did that, we found that the virus was actually limited by this drug, and very potently."

As it turns out, Diaz-Griffero's lab was also working on Zika virus treatments as a separate project, and his shock at this outcome led him to continue testing the drug on several other elusive diseases.

"We started testing dengue, West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis virus," he said. "Then we tested Ebola virus. They were all inhibited by this drug."

The drug even inhibited COVID-19 -- the original strain as well as the U.K., South Africa, and Brazil variants. These viruses are just the tip of the iceberg, according to Diaz-Griffero's patent application, which states that the invention's mechanism means that it can tackle many other diseases that lack dedicated medication, too.

The exciting discovery adds to the growing number of upcoming epidemiology advances, particularly a recent promising development regarding a vaccine against malaria.

Diaz-Griffero loosely compares his discovery with the way antibiotics work, noting that it isn't quite the same because, while it could be effective against a slew of viruses, it won't be for all of them.

"An antibiotic inhibits protein synthesis of all bacteria, so it doesn't matter which bacteria you're infected with. In viruses, this concept doesn't exist," he said. "It's almost like we found an antibiotic for viruses."

Due to its versatility, the drug has already received interest from U.S. Department of Defense officials who hope to have it on hand to guard against future biological attacks. Diaz-Griffero also plans to publish a paper concerning ongoing tests in which the drug is converted to an intra-nasal spray to treat COVID-19. The pandemic has killed 2.8 million people around the world.

"One of the issues with this pandemic that we are having right now is that this is the 3rd one that has occurred in the last 20 years," he said. "This is going to continuously happen, so we need to have drugs like this one, drugs that can have a wide range of viruses."

Several viruses targeted by the invention can have devastating impacts if untreated.

In 2016, the World Health Organization declared Zika virus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, with more than 3000 infants born with debilitating defects. Dengue fever's worldwide case count has increased from 2.4 million in 2010 to 4.2 million in 2019. And another Ebola outbreak, in Guinea, was officially declared in February [2021], with 13 deaths reported in Africa.

The necessary human trials to begin the process of making the drug available to the public will begin in about 2 years, the researchers say.

James E. Crowe Jr., director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Center and a professor in the department of pathology, microbiology and immunology at Vanderbilt University, urged researchers to test the drug very rigorously.

"Whether or not these particular compounds are safe and effective against such diverse viruses in vivo will need to be tested more broadly, to determine the level of promise for human use," Crowe told The Academic Times.

But he said the innovative molecule appears to have footing, adding, "This finding suggests an important common step in the virus lifecycle that is vulnerable to inhibition by drugs."

However, Nikko Quevada, lead scientific advisor and patent agent at the patent research firm Parola Analytics, has reservations regarding DGP.

"The success of a compound as drug depends on so many factors, such as potential side effects," he told The Academic Times. "Even if a drug is effective, it won't be commercially successful if it has severe side effects."

Quevada also stressed that for a patent application, "Often, you need only results from in vitro or animal model tests, and these tests are not conclusive. But patents on drugs -- even based only on these preliminary tests -- are allowed because the more conclusive evidence, clinical trials, require as long as 10 years."

Diaz-Griffero intends to conduct extensive toxicity and safety testing prior to the human clinical trials, although he noted that the drug was considered completely non-toxic in all mouse studies, so far.

According to the 2019 paper, those studies were conducted on mice that were genetically altered, referred to as knockout mice, to be susceptible to infection of the diseases tested.

The mechanism of the new antiviral agent is at the crux of its groundbreaking nature. Citing Remdesivir, which is being used for COVID-19, Diaz-Griffero relayed that typical virus medications don't always work very well because viruses have so much genetic variability that it's nearly impossible for one drug to target every single type, even if it can attack up to 99%.

"Usually with viruses, like RNA viruses, the problem is escape," he explained. "They change and escape. In this case, if you target the host, [the host] won't change."

DGP, which Diaz-Griffero says hasn't yet been used commercially, circumvents this issue in a unique way. It temporarily alters a body's cell that has been infiltrated by a virus in a way that prevents the virus from infecting the cell without needing to attack the virus at all.

Dhruv H. Patel, an infectious disease specialist and critical care physician in New York, told The Academic Times that the drug is seemingly quite effective based on the mice studies. But he noted a potential caveat: The testing was, thus far, only done in an ideal setting.

"It is an interesting discovery, which shows good results in controlled lab settings," he said. "As a clinician, I am always skeptical about experiments in controlled settings and its true impact in the real world."

Patel pointed out that in the experiments, DGP and Zika virus were injected in mice around the same time.

"They do not provide data on an established Zika virus infection, and hence its true real-world applicability is difficult to deduce," he said.

But if the newfound molecule is still effective after being run through the crucial tests that experts -- including the inventor himself -- are recommending, it could be revolutionary.

Viruses enter the cell through its built-in transport chain; they pass the cell membrane, then push into a vesicle. Vesicles can be thought of as train cars, and the one the virus enters is called an endosome. However, endosomes are always headed to their next station, the lysosome. That complicates things for the virus.

"The lysosome is almost like a really bad place for the virus. Everything gets destroyed there," Diaz-Griffero said. "And if the virus is trapped [in the endosome] for too long, it's completely destroyed because it goes directly to the lysosome, where everything is digested."

This is bad news for the virus, but terrific for the inventor. The drug prevents the virus from leaving the vesicle before reaching the lysosome, forcing its death. It does this by impeding the virus' exit route.

"To get out of the vesicle, the pH of that vesicle has to be acidic," Diaz-Griffero said. "This drug, what it does is it changes this acidic pH; it makes it neutral. So the virus cannot enter the cell."

When the virus, inside the endosome and traveling toward the center of the cell, is ready to begin infection, it will find itself trapped and unable to ever leave. Upon inevitably reaching the endpoint lysosome, it will die.

"Abstract
Background
Flaviviruses such as Zika cause sporadic pandemic outbreaks worldwide. There is an urgent need for anti-Zika virus (ZIKV) drugs to prevent mother-to-child transmission of ZIKV, new infections in high-risk populations, and the infection of medical personnel in ZIKV-affected areas.

"Methods
Here, we showed that the small molecule 6-deoxyglucose-diphyllin (DGP) exhibited anti-ZIKV activity both in vitro and in vivo. DGP potently blocked ZIKV infection across all human and monkey cell lines tested. DGP also displayed broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other flaviviruses. Remarkably, DGP prevented ZIKV-induced mortality in mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (_Ifnar1-/-_). Cellular and virological experiments showed that DGP blocked ZIKV at a pre-fusion step or during fusion, which prevented the delivery of viral contents into the cytosol of the target cell. Mechanistic studies revealed that DGP prevented the acidification of endosomal/lysosomal compartments in target cells, thus inhibiting ZIKV fusion with cellular membranes and infection.

"Findings
These investigations revealed that DGP inhibits ZIKV infection in vitro and in vivo.

"Interpretation
The small molecule DGP has great potential for preclinical studies and the ability to inhibit ZIKV infection in humans."

This agent still needs to be tested in infected humans, as mouse studies do not always reflect results in humans, but it does show potential to be an effective broadly reacting anti-viral. - Mod.LK
