3rd cattle farm infected with Schmallenberg virus
-------------------------------------------------
[For subscribers' convenience, official data of 3 Feb 2012 have been added in brackets].

SBV has been detected, so far, in 3 cattle farms. The 3rd infection has been demonstrated on a dairy farm in Peize, Noordenveld municipality. The other 2 are in Echten (Drenthe) and Ens (Flevoland). The number of positive sheep farms has risen to 84 [85]. The number of goat farms with SBV confirmed remains unchanged, namely 4. [However, on 4 Feb the AGD reported a 5th case in goats].

As of Thu 2[3] Feb 2012, a total of 385 [397] reports from concerned farmers have been received by the nVWA [new Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority]. At present, 53 [49] cattle farms, 26 [23] sheep farms and 5 [3] goat farms are still under examination.

[According to another newswire of the same journal, several countries have applied to the Netherlands authorities for information on SBV; this included Algeria, Turkey, the Czech Republic, China, Argentina and Moldova. The following countries have temporarily stopped imports of Dutch cattle, semen and embryos: Ukraine, Russia, Egypt and Mexico.

Further, the AGD reports that the Dutch Central Veterinary Institute in Lelystad has started experimental infection trials with SBV in sheep. In addition, the effort in the development of a serlogical test for SBV is expected to provide such a test in several weeks. A serological test will be essential to continue exports.- Mod. AS].

BVA stresses ‘desperate’ need for Schmallenberg test
----------------------------------------------------
A leading vet has warned that it will be impossible to gauge the scale and severity of the Schmallenberg Virus (SBV) outbreak until a serological test is available.

So far, 11 cases of the virus that causes serious defects and stillbirths in newborn calves and lambs have been confirmed in sheep farms in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Kent and East Sussex. But these cases are almost certainly just the tip of the iceberg, vets predict.

Currently the disease is being diagnosed in Britain by AHVLA diagnosed through a complex and lengthy laboratory process involving gene analysis based on information provided by the Netherlands and the Friedrich Loeffler Institute.

While this does confirm suspected cases it does not give any indication as to how many farms have been infected, British Veterinary Association president Carl Padgett said. He said it was possible that thousands of animals were infected in eastern England in the autumn. "But until we get a serological blood test that shows exposure, we don’t know where the infection has gone and the proportion of infected animals that have these horrible problems with the lamb crop," he said.

AHVLA, along with equivalent bodies in other EU countries, are working to develop a blood test. Mr Padgett said he hoped a test would be available within weeks, or at least months, although AHVLA is not giving any indications on possible timescales.

An AHVLA spokesperson said: "There is a new test which can detect presence of the virus (PCR test) but no serological test yet available in the UK which would be able to show previous exposure to the virus. The laboratories in the UK are working closely with experts across Europe to further improve diagnostic tests as further information about this virus becomes available.”

So far the location of the confirmed cases is consistent with the theory that the farms were infected by midges blown across the Channel from affected areas in Europe last autumn.

Adult animals tend to show few symptoms and recover quickly, with cows, for example, sometimes showing flu-like symptoms and suffering short-term milk yield loss. But it is thought that sheep and cows infected during the first 3rd of their pregnancy are most vulnerable to the serious problems with their offspring experienced in Europe and now eastern England.

This means sheep that were in those early stages of pregnancy when midges were active last autumn, the early lambers this year, are most vulnerable. But those due to lamb later this spring, which may have been put into lamb after the autumn midge season finished, could escape the worst consequences, Mr Padgett said.

But one of the current unknowns is what will happen to calves of cows infected in the early stages of pregnancy in the autumn, due to calve in a few months’ time, Mr Padgett said. He added that there was no guarantee that the disease is currently confined to eastern England. There is also a risk that in-calf heifers imported to all parts of Britain from infected parts of Europe will experience problems when they calf. "It is likely we will see more infection in the vector areas but we don’t [know] yet what the full impact will be on cattle and sheep," Mr Padgett said.
"Everyone is desperate for the serological test. We need it to understand where the virus has got to so we can prepare for what we have to do and assess the impact of this infection. Until we get it we are operating in a bit of black hole."

He said the next ‘big concern’ will be whether infected midges begin spreading the virus more widely when the midge season starts again in the spring. This could happen, for example, if the virus ‘over-wintered’ in infected midges, the likelihood of which is unknown, or if midges pick up fresh infection in Britain from infected calves or lambs, which he said was ‘unlikely’. The third scenario is that a fresh lot of infected midges are blown over from the continent.

Toby Kemble, of the Wensum Valley Veterinary Surgery, in Norfolk, said the practice has been in contact with 10 sheep farms that have started lambing. 6 of them have ‘probably had the disease’, including 1 confirmed case. In some cases only a small proportion of lambs were affected, while in the worst case it was 1 in 4, he said. "We are only going to know the extent of it once people [livestock] have started lambing and calving, because the main signs are deformed lambs and calves," Mr Kemble said.

[A serological test will also enable testing humans in the SBV-affected areas in all countries involved, hopefully to definitely and finally exclude any potential zoonotic impact of the new virus. This issue has been recently raised by a Dutch general practitioner who cautioned pregnant women to avoid entering animal holdings. In a response, experts have commented that pregnant women are advised to stay away from ruminants during parturition periods anyway, due to potential hazards such as chlamydia, Listeria, Q fever, Toxoplasma and other pathogens. Even if SBV will eventually be found to pose a hazard, this year's activity was terminated last autumn.- Mod. AS].

[A map of SBV in Germany as of 3 Feb 2012 is available at http://www.fli.bund.de/fileadmin/dam_uploads/tierseuchen/Schmallenberg_Virus/Karten/Map_Schmallenberg_20120203.jpg.

A map of SBV in the Netherlands, as of 3 Feb 2012, is available at http://www.vwa.nl/txmpub/files/?p_file_id=2201854; the Dutch table on reporting, tested, confirmed, not confirmed, and under-examination farms, according to species, is available at
http://www.vwa.nl/txmpub/files/?p_file_id=2201855.
The Netherlands submitted its 3rd SBV follow-up report to OIE with map on 31 Jan 2012; available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11447.

The Belgian map of SBV, as of 1 Feb 2012 is available at http://www.afsca.be/_pictures/users/Schmallenberg_20120201b_000.jpg;
In total, as of 1 Feb 2012, 349 animal farms in Belgium have been examined for SBV, of which 80 were found (PCR) positive; this included 238 cattle farms (4 positive), 104 sheep farms (75 positive) and 7 goat farms (1 positive).

France submitted to the OIE its 1st report on SBV on 31 Jan 2012. The report, covering 29 outbreaks, all in sheep, with an interactive map, is available at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=11568.

It will be interesting to note if cows which were observed/recorded as suffering from the (mild) clinical disease, attributed to SBV, which was seen during Aug-Oct 2011 in Germany and Netherlands, have given or will give birth to malformed offspring, and if some of them seem to have lost their foeti.

EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health - SCFCAH (Section Animal Health and Welfare) is to convene on Tue, 7 Feb 2012 in Brussels for its monthly 2-day meeting. The 1st issue on the agenda (Section A) will be: "Schmallenberg virus: review of the epidemiological situation and exchange of views on working document SANCO/7012/2012". In view of the dimensions of the emerging epizootic and the reported involvement of 5 member states (Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands and UK), significant surveillance and research activities are expected to be discussed and, hopefully, approved and budgetted. The report of the previous meeting (1-12 Jan 2012), the working document mentioned and the outcome of the discussions, as well as the individual presentations of the countries involved, are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS.]
