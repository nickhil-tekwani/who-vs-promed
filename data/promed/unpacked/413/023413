It was recently announced that this year's [2020] Spanish kaki [persimmon] harvest will be significantly reduced compared to last year [2019] (by around 30%), both due to the lower yields and the impact of pests. In recent days, Valencian producers have been surprised by the abundant presence of the _Mycosphaerella_ fungus, which is causing a huge amount of fruit to fall from the trees. Therefore, the drop in this season's kaki production could actually be much greater.

"It wasn't expected that this disease would have such an impact," says Kiko Torres, Exquisite Fruits [producers & marketers]. "We need to find out why the presence of this fungus has increased so much, although it could be due to the high moisture levels this spring. Some plantations have lost 90% of the harvest in just 4 days. Those growers who have suffered significant losses will have a very difficult time. The impact of pests on kaki production is very worrying. Producers have very few products authorized to treat this crop, while the presence of diseases and pests continues to grow."

[Circular leaf spot (CLS) of persimmon (_Diospyros kaki_) caused by _Plurivorosphaerella nawae_ (previously _Mycosphaerella nawae_) is a serious disease of the crop and a constraint to persimmon production in parts of Asia. Symptoms may include expanding circular spots on leaves surrounded by a halo; leaf necrosis; lesions on fruit; and premature leaf and fruit drop. Disease development is favoured by humid conditions and poor nutritional state of the host.

The pathogen overwinters on leaf debris. Spores are spread by wind and mechanical means during the growing season. Disease management may include cultural and phytosanitary measures as well as fungicides. Resistance breeding in persimmon is restricted by the lack of male flowers in many commercial cultivars.

In Spain, the fungus was identified for the 1st time in 2010 as the cause of a disease outbreak on the crop that occurred in 2008 (see link below). The main problem in the country was reported earlier to be a lack of fungicides whose active ingredients are permitted in the European Union according to European legislation for the registration of agrochemicals.

Related species currently or previously classified in the genus _Mycosphaerella_ cause serious diseases of other crops, including banana (black & yellow sigatokas), chickpea (ascochyta blight), coffee (berry blotch), brassicas (ring spot), and cereals (as part of the septoria complex).
