As of 2017, Ross River disease and Barmah Forest disease continue to infect a considerable number of people in Queensland, Australia. In fact, local rates of these 2 mosquito-borne viral infections have changed little during the past 25 years. [1] (See graph at https://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/AustArbo.png).

[ProMED thanks Dr Berger for pointing out that cases of Ross River and Barmah Forest viruses continue at levels similar to those over the past 25 years. As noted earlier, Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. Both viruses are alphaviruses.
