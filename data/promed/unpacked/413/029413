One more Ebola illness and one more death from the virus have been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Equateur province outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said on Twitter today [18 Aug 2020].

The new developments push the outbreak total to 89 cases and 37 deaths.

In its latest weekly outbreaks and health emergencies report, the WHO regional office said a healthcare worker strike was occurring in some of the affected area, including the provincial capital, Mbandaka. WHO sources and other officials said a 3-day strike over unpaid wages ended yesterday [17 Aug 2020], according to Reuters [see report below. - Mod.LK].

The WHO update also said 5 patients with confirmed Ebola infections remain in the community, posing a risk of further spread. It also noted that 30 health areas have now reported cases, although 3 have gone without a case for 42 days.

Event description: The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, continues to see rising numbers of confirmed cases and geographical spread, with 30 health areas in 10 health zones affected. Since our last report (weekly bulletin 32), another 9 additional confirmed EVD cases have been reported, and 3 new deaths. As of 15 Aug 2020, no new confirmed cases have been detected for the 2nd consecutive day, with no new deaths among confirmed cases. The health areas of Lyembe Moke in Bikoro health zone, Bosomondomba in Bolomba health zone and Butela in Iboko health zone have not reported new confirmed cases for 42 days, with the last confirmed case reported on 4 Jul 2020.

As of 15 Aug 2020, there are a total of 88 cases (84 confirmed and 4 probable) including 36 deaths (case fatality ratio, 41.8%). The case fatality ratio among confirmed cases is 38.1% (32 deaths/84 confirmed cases). The number of health workers affected remains at 3, making up 3.4% of all cases. The number of health areas that have reported at least one confirmed or probable case of EVD since the start of this outbreak has risen to 30, in 10 of the 18 health zones in the province. In the past 21 days (26 Jul 2020 to 15 Aug 2020), 21 confirmed cases have been reported in 14 health areas across 8 health zones.

No new contacts were listed on 15 Aug 2020 from 4 of 8 health zones reporting contacts, with 7 new contacts listed all from the Bolomoba health zone as of 8 Aug 2020. Lolanga Mampoko and Mbandaka did not transmit contact data. Of 3327 active contacts listed, 3160 (95%) were followed up. Of the 60 unseen contacts for whom information was available, 8 (13.3%) had never been seen, 5 (8.3%) were lost to follow-up, and the remaining 47 (78.4%) had not been seen in the previous 24 hours. To date, no contacts have completed their follow-up period, while 24 have become symptomatic, including 19 in Bikoro, 3 in Ingende and 2 in Lotumbe. A total of 394 new alerts were raised on 15 Aug 2020, with most (229; 58.1%) in Bikoro (n = 133) and Bolomba (n = 96). Only 5 of the 10 affected health zones reported data, including Mbandaka, which usually reports the most daily alerts. A total of 422 alerts were reported on 15 Aug 2020, of which 376 (89.1%) were investigated and 120 (31.9%) were validated, with 71 (59.2%) sampled.

Situation interpretation: The EVD outbreak in Equateur Province continues to rise in case numbers and spread to new geographical areas, although Bikoro, Bolomba, and Ibiko health zones have not reported any new confirmed cases for 42 days. Challenges include insufficient funds for the response, along with too few people qualified in risk communication and community engagement, particularly in hotspot areas. Community resistance continues, specifically to sampling and general response measures and some travellers refusing screening at health checkpoints, partly because of poor security support and congestion at these points. Further actions are required to limit spread to other areas, along with intense community engagement with community leaders to prevent resistance to response activities and ensure that communities become fully engaged in response activities. Partners need urgently to address the issue of insufficient funds being available for response, particularly with the concentration of response efforts to COVID-19. It is vital to ensure that COVID-19 response actions do not detract from the response required for EVD.

[Contact tracing is difficult in the best of circumstances. In this outbreak, of 3327 active contacts listed, 3160 (95%) were followed-up. This is a notable accomplishment. But with 60 outstanding contacts, that is a big concern because they are out in the community. - Mod.LK]

Health workers responding to an Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo ended their 3-day strike over unpaid wages on Monday [17 Aug 2020], the World Health Organization and local authorities said.

The Ebola virus in western Congo has spread steadily into remote villages across Equateur province since the 1st case was identified on 1 Jun [2020], infecting 88 people and killing 36.

On Saturday [15 Aug 2020], local laboratory technicians, case management teams, and contact tracers blocked access to the Ebola testing laboratory in the city of Mbandaka, the provincial capital, said Mory Keita, the WHO's Ebola incident manager. They were protesting against the health ministry's recent publication of their pay scales, which they thought were too low, and the government's failure to pay them since the start of the new epidemic, Keita said.

The provincial health minister, Bruno Efoloko, said the governor had concluded negotiations with the striking workers late on Monday [17 Aug 2020] afternoon.

"The negotiations were successful. The laboratory is now operational," Efoloko told Reuters, adding that some lab technicians had returned to work after the talks.

"The national ministry of health promises to examine their claims," Efoloko said. "We will continue to educate others for an effective resumption of activities."

In June [2020], Congo celebrated the end of a separate Ebola outbreak in the east of the country, the 2nd-worst on record, which killed more than 2200 people over 2 years.

The virus strain responsible for the more recent outbreak in Equateur is genetically distinct from the strain in the previous outbreak and is believed to have originated in an animal source, the WHO has said.

[3] Co-circulating strains
- Sat 15 Aug 2020
[Virologica.org, abridged, edited]
https://virological.org/t/two-ebola-virus-variants-circulating-during-the-2020-equateur-province-outbreak/538

On 5 Jun 2020, we posted the 1st viral genome from the 2020 Equateur Province outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the cluster of cases was caused by a new spillover event and represented the 11th Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

As of 14 Aug [2020], the outbreak has steadily increased to 88 cases and 36 deaths across 9 health zones. Samples have been sent to the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB) Pathogen Sequencing laboratory in Kinshasa for genomic analysis, and 32 additional viral genomes have been generated from 4 health zones: Bikoro, Bolomba, Iboko, and Mbandaka.

Samples were sequenced using an amplicon strategy developed with PrimalScheme (using MK007330 as a reference to generate the primers), followed by Illumina Nextera DNA Flex library preparation. The consensus genomes were generated using iVar. These additional genomes have full coverage of the GP gene, which was lacking in the 1st genome that we generated.

The new EBOV genomes were aligned to single representatives from previous EVD outbreaks using MAFFT, and a phylogenetic tree was inferred using RaxML (see Figure 1 in URL above).

Samples from Bikoro, Mbandaka, and Bolomba health zones reveal sustained human-to-human transmission from the new 2020 Equateur Ebola virus variant (Figure 1). However, one sample from Iboko health zone, MBK067, did not cluster with the other sequences from 2020 but instead clustered with sequences from the 2018 Equateur Province outbreak (Figure 1). The 2018 Equateur Province outbreak occurred from April-July 2018 and resulted in 54 cases and 33 deaths. Iboko health zone accounted for 26 of the cases.

Despite occurring over 2 years after the 2018 Equateur Province outbreak was declared over, MBK067 has only 10 mutations when compared to genomes from the 2018 outbreak (with 18FHV008 being the closest genome), much fewer than expected from continuous human-to-human transmission over the same time period. The high level of similarity to previous 2018 Equateur sequences and the slowed evolutionary rate indicates that this case is likely the result of transmission initiated from a persistently infected source and, therefore, a continuation of the 2018 Equateur outbreak. However, 18FHV008 is one of the earliest cases from the 2018 Equateur outbreak, opening the possibility that MBK067 is the result of a transmission chain initiated from a 2nd spillover from the same reservoir population.

Epidemiological reports and preliminary sequencing indicate onward transmission of this variant to at least 2 other cases. Further sequencing is ongoing to try and improve the coverage of these high ct samples, and to explore the genomes present in Ebola-positive semen samples from survivors of the 2018 EVD outbreak, to enable more definitive analysis.

We present the 1st known occurrence of 2 EBOV variants circulating contemporaneously within the same geographical area. As the rate of EVD outbreaks increase, in-country genome sequencing will be an essential tool, in conjunction with traditional contact tracing, to help untangle these intermixing transmission chains.

This interesting finding does not distinguish between transmission of the 2018 genotype from a persistently infected person or a new spillover event from a sylvatic source. The slow rate of mutation leading to only 10 mutations in this new strain compared to the 2018 strain suggests persistence but doesn't answer the question whether this is persistence in bats or another animal or humans. An experimental study on Marburg virus suggests it persisted within experimentally infected _Rousettus aegyptiacus_ bats for 7 months (Schuh AJ et al. Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14446) but it could equally have been a persistently infected person who initiated a new transmission chain, perhaps though sexual transmission. - Mod.LK
