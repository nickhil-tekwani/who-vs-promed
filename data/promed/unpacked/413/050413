As of noon today [23 Mar 2016], there have been a total of:
1358 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
577 deaths [reported case fatality rate 42.5%],
761 recoveries, and
20 currently active cases, including 3 asymptomatic infections.

In the past 24 hours there have been:
2 newly confirmed cases
0 newly reported fatalities
2 newly reported recoveries.

Information on newly confirmed cases (2):
1. A 57 year old Saudi male from Buraidah, non-healthcare worker, currently in a critical condition. Classification under investigation but reported as no contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

2. An 84 year old Saudi female from Alrass, non-healthcare worker, currently in a stable condition. Classification under investigation but reported as no contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

Information on newly reported recoveries (2):
1. A 72 year old Saudi male from Riyadh, non-healthcare worker, history of pre-existing co-morbidities. [I could not find a 72 year old Saudi male from Riyadh reported in 2016; there was a 72 year old male reported from Ruwaidah Alard on 26 Feb 2016 and one from Alartawia on 29 Feb 2016, both locations in Riyadh province. - Mod.MPP]

2. A 47 year old Saudi male from Taif, non-healthcare worker, no history of co-morbidities [reported as a newly confirmed case on 14 Mar 2016 at which time he was noted to be in stable condition. At the time of initial confirmation was classified as a secondary household contact. - Mod.MPP].

[Cases continue to be identified in Buraidah (Qassim province). Alrass is located in Qassim province, approximately 94 km to the south west of Buraidah, so it is possible that the individual reported from Alrass may have had contact in Buraidah where there has been ongoing transmission in the healthcare setting. On the daily map of Saudi Arabia showing the locations of daily reported MERS-CoV cases [available at the source URL], deaths and recoveries, the map shows 2 newly confirmed cases in Buraidah, supporting this hypothesis. Since 3 Mar 2016, there have been 31 cases of laboratory confirmed infection with MERS-CoV in Buraidah. - Mod.MPP]

Between [15 and 16 Mar 2016], the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 4 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including one death. One of these reported cases is linked to the MERS-CoV outbreak currently occurring in a hospital in Buraidah city.

Details of the cases
1. A 54 year old, non-national male from Buraidah city developed symptoms on [4 Mar 2016] and, on [9 Mar 2016], was admitted to the hospital where the MERS-CoV outbreak is currently occurring. Prior to symptom onset, the patient regularly visited the same health care facility for an unrelated medical condition. On [14 Mar 2016], the patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV. Currently, he is in a critical condition in ICU. Investigation of epidemiological links with MERS-CoV cases admitted to the same hospital or with shared healthcare workers is ongoing. The case has no history of exposure to the other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

2. An 84 year old male from Buraidah city developed symptoms on [2 Mar 2016] and, on [9 Mar 2016], was admitted to hospital. The patient, who had comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [11 Mar 2016]. He passed away on [14 Mar 2016]. Investigation of history of exposure to the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing.

3. A 45 year old male from Riyadh city developed symptoms on [29 Feb 2016] and, on [13 Feb 2016 - typo??? 13 Mar 2016], was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [14 Mar 2016]. Currently, the patient is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. Investigation of history of exposure to the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing.

4. A 78 year old female from Alkharj city developed symptoms on [10 Mar 2016] and, on [13 Mar 2016], was admitted to hospital.

[The global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection continues to increase at a slow but steady pace related predominantly to the steady reporting of cases from Saudi Arabia, with 75 cases having been reported from Saudi Arabia since 1 Jan 2016. The above WHO update confirms cases reported to WHO up through 16 Mar 2016; since then, there have been 9 additional newly confirmed cases reported, and 5 deaths.
