Chicken Adulterated with Beef Protein Could Constitute a BSE Risk
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Vast quantities of frozen chicken adulterated with beef protein powder,
which the authorities admit could present a risk of BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy), are being consumed in Britain, a Guardian [newspaper]
investigation has revealed. The beef proteins are added to make the chicken
absorb extra water in a process called "tumbling" so that it can be sold
for vast profits. Thai and Brazilian chicken breasts have been doctored by
processors in the Netherlands and imported into the UK in this way for at
least 5 years. Food safety authorities have been aware of the problem since
1997. But they have only recently developed DNA tests sophisticated enough
to [detect] the beef proteins, according to the leading trading standards
officer on the case, John Sandford of Hull city council. The [adulterated]
chicken is widely used in pubs, clubs, restaurants and canteens, by
manufacturers of processed chicken products, and may have been distributed
to schools.

The Irish food safety authority found the beef protein in Dutch chicken.
They had been tipped off by the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) that there
were concerns about chicken breast fillets imported from the Netherlands. A
report published by the Irish FSA last month found that more than half its
samples contained foreign DNA which was not declared on the label. A total
of 7 samples contained bovine DNA, 7 pork DNA, and 3 both. Most also either
failed to declare how much water was in them or had more water than the
label claimed. One sample was 43 percent water.

"The main concern is the source of the undeclared bovine material," the
report says. Andrew Reilly, deputy chief executive of the Irish FSA said:
"This amounts to blatant fraud. You can't call these products chicken
fillets. We have no idea where this bovine material is coming from." Asked
whether he thought that meant there was a risk of BSE, he said: "You might
say that. I couldn't possibly comment." The Irish authorities have now
impounded the meat, but the UK FSA has not acted to remove the same brands
from sale in this country.

Peter Smith, chairman of SEAC, the UK government's advisory committee which
monitors BSE risks, confirmed that the FSA had formally alerted him to the
Irish findings. "If you don't know the source of the material, there is
clearly a potential for a risk."

The Irish FSA report names brands by the Dutch companies Lelie, Vrieskoop,
and de Kippenhof as containing bovine DNA. The Lelie brands also contained
pork DNA. All were chicken imported from Thailand and Brazil through the
Netherlands where they had been "tumbled" with water and additives
containing hydrolysed proteins. These are proteins extracted either
chemically or at high temperatures from old animals or parts of animals not
normally used for human food such as hide, bones, feathers, skin and
ligaments and then injected with water into the chicken. Lelie's quality
manager Ronald Buis acknowledged that the proteins injected in his chicken
came from beef. The powder was supplied by Vaessen and Schoemaker he said.
"All the animals are checked by the government in Holland, or they were
checked by some other government." The Dutch firm Vaessen and Schoemaker
refused to disclose the contents of its protein mixes. Teun Lelie, managing
director of Lelie, said V&S was not his supplier and denied that he used
beef proteins.

Vrieskoop makes the Duke brand of chicken, one of the most popular among
caterers in the UK. Sales director Martin van der Arend told us that he did
not know how the bovine DNA had got into his chicken and that his tests in
private laboratories had not found it. "We think it is something to do with
what the chickens ate in Brazil." He added: "We only use proteins from
chicken skin to inject our meat. You need that otherwise the water comes
out." He had written guarantees from his protein manufacturer that it
contained no beef, he said.

The sales director of De Kippenhof, one of whose brands contained 41
percent water, declined to comment.

UK wholesalers confirm these brands are still available. One said the Duke
brand would be suitable for use in schools. Dayal Sharma, former president
of the Hindu cultural society of Bradford, said he thought Hindus, who do
not eat beef, would be very angry at the findings. "It's disgusting and a
crime. People will not eat chicken if this is happening."

David Byrne, European commissioner for health and consumer protection said
that if he received further evidence of fraud he would consider open
proceedings against the Dutch. At heated meetings in Brussels last month,
according to minutes seen by the Guardian, several member states said "this
sort of fraud was extremely shocking and risked undermining consumer
confidence in chicken meat."

[The risk is 2-fold: (1) Transmission of the BSE agent to susceptible
cattle inadvertently or deliberately fed human food waste; and (2) direct
exposure of the human population to the risk of developing variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.)in
ProMED-mail] as a result of consumption of processed chicken containing the
BSE agent. The former risk is probably low in the UK and Ireland following
controls introduced subsequent to the last foot and mouth disease outbreak.

Nonetheless, although conventional viruses and bacteria would be unlikely
to survive the hydrolysis of beef protein, the BSE agent might be
resistant. The second risk is unquantifiable, since the route of
transmission of the BSE agent to humans and the dose of agent required to
induce vCJD are unknown.

The risk will clearly depend on the origin of the beef protein, but the
prevalence of BSE in cattle has been greatly reduced by the success of the
control measures introduced to limit the spread of BSE from the UK, and
consequently the amount of potentially contaminating BSE agent might not be
sufficient to constitute an infectious dose. Epidemiological studies have
failed to confirm unequivocally that vCJD is contracted through consumption
of butcher's meat derived from BSE-infected cattle. The data should be
scrutinized again for a possible link with consumption of processed
chicken. - Mod.CP]
