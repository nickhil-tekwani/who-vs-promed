A 2-year-old Idaho boy's death could be linked to the nationwide
outbreak of spinach contaminated with _E. coli_ bacteria, a state
health official said.
The boy may have eaten spinach in the days before becoming ill.
Testing results are expected sometime next week, said Idaho
epidemiologist Dr. Christine Hahn, who spoke to CNN affiliate KBCI in Boise.
"At this point we don't have any cultures finished yet ... but
apparently he had bloody diarrhea and then developed kidney
complications that are known to be associated with this type of _E.
coli_," Hahn said.
In another suspected _E. coli_ death, Maryland health officials are
investigating whether an elderly woman's death was caused by eating
bad spinach, a newspaper reported. The Herald-Mail of Hagerstown
reported Fri, 22 Sep 2006, that a sample of spinach eaten by a
86-year-old before she died 13 Sep 2006 is being tested for contamination.
The 2-year-old became sick 15 Sep 2006 after friends said his mother
had blended spinach into a smoothie for him. He was initially
hospitalized at Portneuf Medical Center in the eastern Idaho town of
Chubbuck, before being transferred to Primary Children's Medical
Center in Salt Lake City where he died overnight Wednesday from
kidney complications, according to CNN affiliate KSL.
Doctors said the boy's kidney failure was caused by hemolytic uremic
syndrome, which could come from _E. coli_ bacteria, KSL reported.
About 7 percent of the nation's 157 reported cases of infection were
in children under 5.
