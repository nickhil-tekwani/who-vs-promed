The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of the Interior
(DOI) today [15 Oct 2006] announced a detection of H5 and N1 avian
influenza subtypes in samples from apparently healthy wild Northern
pintails in Ottawa County, Ohio that were killed by a hunter. Initial tests
confirm that these wild bird samples do not contain the highly pathogenic
H5N1 strain that has spread through birds in Asia, Europe and Africa.
Initial test results indicate the presence of low pathogenic avian
influenza (LPAI) virus, which poses no threat to human health.
The bird samples were collected on 8 Oct 2006 through a partnership between
USDA and the Ohio Division of Wildlife as part of an expanded wild bird
monitoring program. USDA and DOI are working collaboratively with states to
sample wild birds throughout the U.S. for the presence of highly pathogenic
avian influenza (HPAI). As a result of this expanded testing program, USDA
and DOI expect to identify additional cases of common strains of avian
influenza in birds, which is not cause for concern.
35 samples were collected directly from the birds and screened for H5 at
the Ohio Dept. of Agriculture Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. Of
those samples, 2 were sent to USDA's National Veterinary Services
Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa for confirmatory testing, and one
screened by NVSL tested positive for both H5 and N1 subtypes. This does not
mean these birds are infected with an H5N1 strain. It is possible that
there could be 2 separate avian influenza viruses, one containing H5 and
the other containing N1.
Confirmatory testing underway at NVSL will clarify whether one or more
strains of the virus are present, the specific subtype, as well as confirm
the pathogenicity. These results are expected within 2 to 3 weeks and will
be made public when completed.
Low pathogenic avian influenza commonly occurs in wild birds. It typically
causes only minor sickness or no noticeable symptoms in birds. These
strains of the virus include LPAI H5N1, commonly referred to as "North
American" H5N1, which is very different from the more severe HPAI H5N1
circulating overseas.
There is no known health risk to hunters or hunting dogs from contact with
low pathogenic forms of avian influenza virus. Nevertheless, hunters are
always encouraged to use common sense sanitation practices, such as hand
washing and thorough cooking, when handling or preparing wildlife of any
kind. DOI has issued guidelines for safe handling and preparation of wild game.

[Certainly the old adage "seek and ye shall find" has been true with wild
birds. Although this is clear evidence that surveillance works, it may also
be an indication of overreaction.
In the states that have previously discovered a wild bird with low
pathogenic avian influenza, the results have been very unpleasant. There
appears to be no education from USDA regarding our trading partners. Those
states previously reporting have suffered economic losses to their
commercial poultry industry because of bans by such countries as Russia. It
would seem that the USDA could explain the surveillance plan to our trading
partners so that reporting could continue without costing the states
economically. Presently, this explanation has not happened. - Mod.TG]
