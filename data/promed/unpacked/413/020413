Jeffrey Paul Davis died on [16 Jan 2018] at the University of Wisconsin Hospital. He was born in Milwaukee on [22 Aug 1945] to Mynette Babrove Davis and Maurice Davis. He was the beloved husband of Roseanne Clark and father of Eli and Ethan Clark-Davis; brother of Susan Davis Silver (Larry); brother-in-law of Debbie and Ron Fellman and Russell and Lori Clark; Uncle of Ben and Kate Silver; Becky, Matt, and Daniel Fellman and Jesse, Joshua and Justin Clark.

Jeff was the Chief Medical Officer for Communicable Diseases and the State Epidemiologist for the State of Wisconsin for over 40 years. He was also Adjunct Professor of Pediatrics and Population Health Sciences at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. He attended Whitefish Bay High School, University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Honorary Society. Jeff attended the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine and did his Pediatric Residency at the University of Florida and completed his Pediatric Infectious Disease Fellowship at Duke University Medical Center.

Jeff was proud to have served in the Epidemiological Intelligence Service at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and he continued to mentor numerous EIS fellows as well as medical students interested in public health. He was passionate about public health, especially the health of the people of Wisconsin. He was also a brilliant medical detective, making the connection between toxic shock syndrome and tampons and on the team that identified the infectious agent transmitted by ticks that causes Lyme disease, and he led numerous significant public health investigations of outbreaks in Wisconsin, including the identification of cryptosporidium in the water supply in Milwaukee affecting over 800 000 residents. This was the largest waterborne disease outbreak in documented United States history. Dr. Davis' contributions to the fields of infectious disease, epidemiology and public health are reflected in his over 250 publications. In addition, Jeff was an avid sports enthusiast and loved watching Badger football and basketball, the Packers, PGA and tennis tournaments, and attending Madison Symphony Orchestra concerts and travel.

Jeff was a truly wonderful friend and neighbor and will be tremendously missed for his gentle kindness, sense of humor, and his enthusiastic sharing of his vast knowledge of all things music and sports. Jeff greatly appreciated his walks with his dog, Bodhi.

Jeff's family has deep gratitude to his medical team at UW Hospital and Clinics and the staff of the TLC.

The funeral will be this Friday, [19 Jan 2018] at 2:00 pm. The service will be held at the First Unitarian Society, 900 University Bay Drive in the Landmark Auditorium. Following the service, burial will take place at Natural Path Sanctuary at the Farley Center, 2299 Spring Rose Road, Verona.

In lieu of flowers, donations in Jeff's memory will be greatly appreciated and may be made to the Jeffrey P. Davis, MD Scholarship at the University of Wisconsin Foundation. This scholarship will support medical students who are dedicated to a career in public health. Please share a memory at http://www.CressFuneralService.com.

Jeff and I were EIS classmates and first met during the EIS epidemiology course in July 1973. We stayed in touch over the years at EIS and CSTE conferences and infectious disease meetings. He was an outstanding epidemiologist, mentor, and public health leader who made numerous important contributions. He played a key role in the recognition of and response to a number of outbreaks involving emerging pathogens, including the large waterborne outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Milwaukee in 1993.

I looked forward to hearing about his recent experiences whenever we met. He will be missed by many colleagues and friends. Residents of Wisconsin were fortunate to have him in his public health leadership role for many years.

[I had occasional interaction with Jeff during my 33 years on the University of Wisconsin-Madison faculty. He and I were together this past October 2017 at a meeting of the scientific advisory board of the Midwest Center of Excellence for Vector-borne Diseases. The obituary describes him and his career very well. He was much appreciated for his quiet and constructive wisdom and knowledge, not to mention over 250 publications. He will be fondly remembered and admired in Wisconsin for a long time to come. - Mod.TY]

[I had the good fortune to know Jeff while I was at CDC as an EIS (Epidemic Intelligence Service) officer, and at annual EIS meetings in Atlanta as well as at other scientific conferences. I enjoyed our discussions on the EIS, emerging infectious diseases, and other public health issues, as well as our ventures into political discussions, nationally, internationally and CDC related. He was a wonderful person who touched many lives. In 2012, he was awarded the Distinguished Friend of the EIS award, which honors an individual who has provided exceptional mentoring and support to EIS Officers, very well deserved. As Mod.TY said above, he will be fondly remembered and admired, not only in Wisconsin, for a long time to come. - Mod.MPP]
