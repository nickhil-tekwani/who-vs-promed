-------------------------------------------------------------
I find the posting somewhat perplexing. The article contains the
statement, "Veterinarians said it was an upper respiratory disease
that came from a virus that mutated from horses" yet goes on to later
state, "Veterinarians said the dogs died from a rare form of
streptococcus." It's quite clear from the onset that there is some
confusion on the part of the author of the article as to the actual
underlying causative agent. Later the article states that the strep
organism found does not affect people, yet _Streptococcus equi_
subsp. _zooepidemicus_ is infectious to people. One has to wonder if
this is just another description of an outbreak of the newly emerged
H3N5 equine influenza mutation (CIV), in a shelter. After all, strep
is commonly cultured from the pulmonary tissue of dogs that die from
CIV and is often acting as a secondary opportunistic agent.

Comments by the moderator appear to make the conclusion that these
animals were infected with _Streptococcus equi_ subsp.
_zooepidemicus_ by making the statement "_Streptococcus
zooepidemicus_ is generally regarded as the causative agent of
hemorrhagic pneumonia in dogs." I don't believe this statement is now
accurate. With the emergence of the highly contagious H3N5 equine
influenza mutation (CIV), currently causing outbreaks of acute fatal
hemorrhagic pneumonia in dog shelters and other canine colonies, I
would question if this is the view currently held by most canine
epidemiologists. As a practicing veterinarian investigating an
outbreak of acute fatal hemorrhagic pneumonia in dogs in a shelter,
the current presumption would be H3N5 canine influenza virus until
ruled out, even if a strep organism was cultured. The article
mentions a virus that mutated from horses yet nowhere does it mention
that CIV has been ruled out. While I understand the article has been
edited, as written one cannot conclude what the underlying
etiological agent was.

[The article was somewhat confusing for the very reasons that Dr
Lelli points out. When I first started working this piece for
moderation, H3N5 was high on my personal differential list and
somewhere along the way, it dropped off, likely because of the very
things Dr Lelli points out. I am grateful to my fellow colleagues and
sharp-eyed readers.

It is sometime difficult to sort out whether it is a virus or a
bacteria based upon newspaper accounts. There are days that I am able
to chase down a contact at the site and learn more, but there are
equally days when my efforts fail.

I would have to agree with Dr Lelli, that with no more information
than the news article provided, it is impossible to tell if this is a
virus, possibly H3N5 or if this is a bacteria, perhaps one of the
strep species.

If there is someone with more information on this situation,
ProMED-mail would welcome the clarification.

I also have to wonder if 'strangles', for strep in dogs is
appropriate, or should only be reserved for the situation in horses.
Perhaps this piece should more accurately be titled hemorrhagic
pneumonia. - Mod.TG]
