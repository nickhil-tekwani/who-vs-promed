The Union Health Ministry has also rushed a team from the National Centre for Diseases Control, Delhi and NIV Pune has decided to set up a virology laboratory at the Kozhikode medical college hospital to speed up tests. A control room has also been set up in the city.

A 12-year-old boy died after contracting the Nipah virus in north Kerala's Kozhikode on [Sun 5 Sep 2021], triggering fear of a possible outbreak of another deadly virus while the state is still struggling to contain the 2nd wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

State health minister Veena George said all 3 samples of the boy were found to be positive for Nipah virus by the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune. At least 18 close contacts, mainly relatives and health workers, of the boy and 150 2ary contacts were identified and quarantined. Among the first group 2 health workers later showed symptoms of Nipah, the minister said.

"There is no need to panic. But strict vigil is the need of the hour. We have a strict Nipah protocol and we will go by that," said the minister in Kozhikode after attending a high-powered meeting also attended by 2 other ministers, A K Saseendran and Mohamad Riyaz.

The minister said the boy was initially admitted to a government hospital but later shifted to a private hospital with a high fever a week ago. In the beginning he was suspected to be suffering from brain fever but later samples were rushed to the NIV for further testing. The boy died in the early hours of [Sun 5 Sep 2021]. She said all relatives of the boy and all those involved in his treatment were put under quarantine.

Some of the relatives of the boy later complained that though the victim showed symptoms for many days, medical college authorities failed to test his samples. When the fever did not subside they shifted him to a private hospital which sent samples for testing immediately. The minister said the government will inquire into the possible lapse.

The Union Health Ministry has also rushed a team from the National Centre for Diseases Control, Delhi and NIV Pune has decided to set up a virology laboratory at the Kozhikode medical college hospital to speed up tests. A control room has also been set up in the city. The minister said she will camp in the city and the route map of the boy will be published soon. Later the deceased was buried under strict Nipah protocol in a public burial ground in the city.

State health authorities said they have no idea about the source of infection but like earlier cases, fruit bats are suspected. Like COVID-19, isolation and quarantine are the best options to contain Nipah virus but its fatality rate is very high, experts said. A zoonotic disease is that triggered by a pathogen (an infectious agent) that can be transmitted from animals to humans through body fluid and human to humans through fluids, said experts.

"The situation is not like 2018 when we were totally in the dark. Since a majority of people are observing physical distance and masking it can be contained effectively," said critical care expert Dr. A S Anoop Kumar, who played a key role during the 2018 outbreak which claimed 17 lives in Kozhikode and was later localized and contained effectively. Following the fresh detection of another virus, a high alert has been sounded in two neighbouring districts, Kannur and Malappuram. Former health minister K K Shailaja also said contact tracing is key in containing the virus.

An unknown virus with no medicine or history of treatment and very little information about the carrier, made health experts hit a blind alley in the initial stages of the outbreak in 2018. But they fought back and contained its secondary infection and nursed back 2 Nipah-positive persons (A., a nursing student and U., a male nurse) back to life, though the deadly virus claimed 17 lives in a span of 10 days. L., a young nurse who treated the initial patient, was among the dead.

The Indian state of Kerala, which saw a previous outbreak of Nipah virus [NiV] in 2018 and stray cases going back to as far as 2001, has again reported a case on [Sun 5 Sep 2021]. The patient, a 12-year-old boy, passed away hours after his reports confirmed that his symptoms were because of the NiV infection.

He had recently recovered from COVID-19 but was admitted to a hospital on [1 Sep 2021] for a relentless high fever and breathing difficulties. The government has said that his close contacts have been traced and isolated, and all of them remain symptom-free. However, it is still advisable to stay cautious because the state's health infrastructure is already burdened in dealing with one pandemic, and a localized endemic could make matters worse.

Moreover, Nipah is known to have been dangerous and because the early symptoms are very similar to that of the novel coronavirus , it is important to stay alert. Here are key points about the disease to help you stay informed.

- What is Nipah Virus?
Nipah virus or (NiV), which was first identified during an outbreak in Kampung Sungai Nipah, Malaysia in 1998, is primarily a zoonotic disease carried by fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family.

Scientists say that viruses like Nipah could have co-existed with the bats in India for a long time only to be pushed out of the mammal in adverse circumstances.

"Viruses like Nipah have always been in the system of fruit bats. They have co-evolved for years. Such a disease becomes virulent when there is a stress on the animal. Such stress could be because of a loss of habitat, or not getting sufficient food for survival. So, when the animal is faced with such stress, it tends to expel these viruses. In other words, the virus tends to move out of animal. This could be what happened in Kozhikode," Dr. Nameer PO had told Firstpost during the previous outbreak.

- What are the symptoms?
Infection with the Nipah virus can cause mild to severe disease, including swelling of the brain (encephalitis) and potentially death.

Symptoms typically appear in the 4-14 days following the exposure to the virus. It often includes signs of respiratory illness, such as cough, sore throat, and difficulty breathing. A phase of brain swelling (encephalitis) may follow, where symptoms can include drowsiness, disorientation, and mental confusion, which can rapidly progress to coma within 24-48 hours.

Long-term side effects in survivors of Nipah virus infection have been noted, including persistent convulsions and personality changes.

Infections that lead to symptoms and sometimes death much later after exposure (known as dormant or latent infections) have also been reported months and even years after exposure, the US CDC said.

- Five precautions to keep yourself safe
Here are five things you can do to keep yourself safe.

AVOID touching animals you don't know and love.
What if you absolutely need to touch a sick animal? Wear gloves and other protective clothing to handle the animals, their meat or body tissue, says the World Health Organisation (WHO).

AVOID buying fruits that are wrinkled, bitted or damaged in any way.
That said, the risk can be eliminated by washing the fruit thoroughly and peeling them before consumption. Fruit with signs of bat bites should be discarded. Freshly collected date palm juice should be boiled.

AVOID drinking anything fermented or stored in the open/under palm trees.
In Bangladesh and India, where Nipah infections are more frequent than anywhere else, exposure is linked to consuming raw date palm sap and contact with bats. Infrared cameras have caught bats licking [and urinating into] the sap before they were collected and consumed by locals. Many of us probably live far from the cooling comfort of coconut/palm trees or a bat cave. But bats are still out and about in cities, so are pigs.

AVOID touching anybody infected with the virus or their things.
What if you need to attend to someone that you think is Nipah positive? Protect yourself from direct contact using gloves, a mask and protective clothing. Regular hand washes are a must after caring for or visiting a Nipah victim.

SEEK early medical attention
If you reside in an area where known cases of Nipah virus exist, it is important to isolate yourself and report to authorities if you feel sick even with mild symptoms. This helps authorities to get you treatment faster, and also control the spread of the infection.

- Is there a vaccine?
A vaccine has been in preclinical development since 2012 and it is currently in clinical development as an emergency vaccine countermeasure for Nipah virus outbreaks. The current formula underworks is said to have shown promising results in preventing Nipah and Hendra virus infection.

- Treatment options
According to the WHO, "There are currently no drugs specific for Nipah virus infection. Treatment is limited to supportive care, including rest, hydration, and treatment of symptoms as they occur. Intensive supportive care is recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications."

- How did Nipah spread during previous outbreaks?
The US Centre for Disease Control states that Nipah virus, originally a zoonotic disease, originates in animals but can spread to humans when they come in contact with infected species. Its' modern-day-transmission is recorded to have happened in the following 3 ways:
- Direct contact with infected animals, such as bats or pigs, or their body fluids (such as blood, urine or saliva);
- Consuming food products that have been contaminated by body fluids of infected animals (such as palm sap or fruit contaminated by an infected bat);
- Close contact with a person infected with NiV or their body fluids (including nasal or respiratory droplets, urine, or blood).
However, the origin could not be traced with certainty always.

Kerala's 2018 localized endemic, in which 17 people lost their lives, started when a 23-year-old male in Kerala's Kozhikode consumed a fruit partially eaten by a bat.

The 1st-ever outbreak of the virus in Malaysia's Nipah village in 1998, had claimed 5 lives. Here, pigs had contracted the disease first, from where it was transmitted to farmers.

Several people had lost their lives to Nipah in Bangladesh in 2004 after consuming date palm saps contaminated by fruit bats and there were a few other outbreaks in and around the region. In 2006, the virus had raised concerns in Siliguri, West Bengal, a state where the first case had been detected as early as 2001. But most of these cases were said to have resulted from human to human contact.

[Cases of encephalitis caused by Nipah virus infection are rare in India but need to be taken seriously when they occur. Most of those who survive acute encephalitis make a full recovery, but around 20% are left with residual neurological consequences such as persistent convulsions and personality changes.

The key to the risk of human exposure to Nipah virus is the prevalence of the virus in fruit bats in the genus _Pteropus_. Research, published in the journal PNAS indicated that Nipah virus (NiV) could circulate among fruit bats, not just in places that have seen human cases, but in any region where they exist. When there is a Nipah virus outbreak among bats, "the greatest number of them will be shedding the virus in their feces, urine, and other body fluids and create an opportunity for NiV to jump to people," lead author of the PNAS article Epstein, said.
