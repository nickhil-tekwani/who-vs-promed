[1] Brazilian case
Date: Thu 21 Nov 2008
From: Dr. Gustavo Trinidade Henriques Filho
<gustavothf@uol.com.br>


[ProMED received questions and comments from
several subscribers. The questions were combined
and Dr. Gustavo Henriques, the physician in
charge of the surviving rabies case, kindly replied. - Mod.TY]

1). Did the patient develop anti-rabies antibody
in blood and CSF? If so, at what stage of his
infection were antibodies 1st detected?

Yes, neutralizing antibodies were detected in the
laboratory of Dr. Ivanete Koteit at the Pasteur
Institute, São Paulo, Brasil. The titers
increased dramatically over the treatment period,
exceeding 100 IU/mL in both serum and CSF.

2). Was rabies virus RNA detected in CSF?

No. Virus RNA was detected in skin (hair follicle).

3). Was the virus isolated and sequenced?

Yes.

4). Was rabies-immune globulin administered to the patient at any time?

No, unfortunately the patient only received
tissue culture-based vaccine. Full prophylaxis was not given.

5). How long after the vampire bat bite was the
1st dose of rabies vaccine administered?

4 days.

6). Was a 5th dose of vaccine administered (after symptoms appeared)?

Unfortunately yes.

7). Since the patient received 4 doses of rabies
vaccine before the 1st symptoms appeared, do you
consider this to be a case of vaccine failure?

Immunoglobulin was not given, which explains the failure of the prophylaxis.

8). Was the Wisconsin protocol followed exactly, or were changes made?

We followed the "Milwaukee protocol" as closely as we could.
We used ketamine, midazolan and amantadine.
We did not use ribavirin, which is the
recommendation of version 2 of the protocol.
We did not use an EEG due to limited availability.

9). Did the patient have cerebral edema? A
neurologist in Thailand wrote to say that of the
several rabies patients that he has attended, cerebral edema was not a problem.

MRI findings included edema of the deep gray matter.
There was no need to treat cerebral edema clinically.

We are delighted to report our survivor, and will
follow up with submission of a detailed
manuscript very quickly, so that others can
achieve similar successes. Please send me copies
of the articles that you [ProMED subscribers and
others] discuss our case, at the following address and e-mail.

[2] Thailand comparison and comment

It is interesting to see the eventual outcome of
this Brazilian case. Approximately 5 weeks after
onset, he became clinically stable, could open
his eyes. He received therapeutic coma and
antiviral 7 days after the onset. Viral RNA could
be demonstrated in hair follicles and saliva,
however, status of antibodies in the serum and CSF were not reported.

Several factors responsible for survival may include:

1. Nature of virus variant. As seen in cases
with good recovery, all were associated with bat
variants; 1972 and 2004 US cases and (hopefully) 2008 Brazilian case

2. Absence of classic manifestations. 1972 US
case had unsteady gait, dysarthria and
hemiparesis 4 days after onset; 1976 dog variant
case had quadriparesis, myoclonus, ataxia,
dysmetria, dysdiadokokinesia, frontal lobe
dysfunctions, bi-brachial weakness; the remaining
(1977 laboratory accident case, one 1994 and 2
1995 Mexican cases related to dog variants and
one Indian related to dog variant in 2003) also
had no typical features of rabies. This may also
include 2004 US and 2008 Brazilian.

It is understandable that bat related cases may
have atypical presentations since at least some
bat variants have different tissue tropism (skin
and dermis cells rather than nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor at the muscle), thus, may
use different neural pathways. However, in the
remaining dog related cases, this is still
intriguing. Having atypical clinical signs in dog
cases may reflect interaction between host
factors and virus spread, resulting to a more favorable outcome.

3. Early development of serum and CSF
neutralizing antibody. This may best explain the
1972 and 2004 US cases. These 2 also did not have
virus recovered or RNA demonstrated.
Nevertheless, this may not be the sole
determinant since 2002 Indian case had CSF
appeared in both compartments as early as day 8
after onset (2004 US had antibody on day 6).
Whether or not presence of virus or viral RNA in
the secretions is a bad prognostic factor remains
to be determined (depending on the outcome of this Brazilian case).

4. Postexposure treatment after symptoms
developed may not be a contraindication. 1972 and
1976 bat cases, and the remaining cases (lab
accident and dog related) either had pre- or post exposure treatment.

What previously believed as immune accelerated
deaths may not be true. We have shown that
furious rabies patients who died faster had more
cell mediated immune (CMI) response to rabies
antigen as well as more cytokine responses (as
determined in the blood) when compared to
paralytic rabies. We proposed this as evidence of
bad immune effect. However, our recent study in
furious and paralytic rabies infected dogs
revealed that furious dogs had more viral load in
the brain but less cytokine response (RNA
transcripts) and less brain MRI disturbances than
paralytic dogs. Virus in the brain then would be
drained into the cervical lymph nodes, explaining
more CMI response in the blood of furious rabies.
The only concern about immune hazard may be the
use of rabies immune globulin. We have treated a
furious rabies patient with large dose of
intravenous rabies immune globulin. This caused
paralytic complications, probably by immune attack against virus in the axon.

5. Therapeutic coma induction. At present, it is
still inconclusive whether survival is due to the
effect of treatment. Longer survival in treated
cases may also be a misunderstanding. Generally,
treatment with intensive care support was
withheld once there were no signs of brain
functions. In cases with therapeutic coma, this
supportive care was prolonged. Autopsy in our
case treated with such protocol revealed
liquefied brain tissue at autopsy (similar to others with same treatment).

Finally, it has been known that virus enters the
brain and spinal cord long before the symptoms
developed. This is based on MRI and
electrophysiologic evidence in rabies patients at
various stages. Once the death cascade starts, it
may not be possible to stop the progression
unless counteractive mechanisms have been
developed more or less at the same stage (such as
development of antibody) which may depend in part
of the nature of virus variant. To date, there
has been no experimental or animal evidence
supporting the role of excitotoxicity in rabies.
Antiviral, ribavirin, cannot penetrate the blood
brain barrier, however, it may help fighting
against virus in the peripheral tissue. Regarding
brain edema, we have never seen brain edema at
autopsy except in our case who was treated with
massive dose of rabies antibody.

[Professor Thiravat Hemachudha added the
followng, after receiving the answers to the questions in part [1] above]:

Therefore, this is what we expected. Rabies
antibody was developed very early in the disease
course, if I understand correctly as what
Dr.Gustavo mentioned. This may be a critical
factor. RNA was demonstrated only in hair
follicles, unlike our case (and others) where RNA
was found with an increasing number at all sites,
CSF, urine, saliva. Viruses at other sites might
have been eradicated since the beginning in this
Brazilian case. There was no EEG monitoring. This
means that coma induction to "burst suppression"
as in Milwaukee protocol may not be that
necessary and usually it is dangerous. To achieve
such a coma stage, dosage of medications would be
large and this requires careful monitoring to
avoid complications it may induce, especially to
the cardiovascular system. Monitoring of cardiac
output, peripheral vascular resistance, wedge
pressure, etc. is necessary as in Thai case and
others (with treatment failure) once large dose of these sedatives is used.

Using such sedatives as in the Brazilian case is
relevant and this has been done to rabies
patients elsewhere in dog rabies endemic
countries for decades with the aim to control
agitated symptoms but not to combat excitotoxic
mechanisms. Vaccine use in this case more or less
suggests that it is not contraindicated. The 1st
survivor and others had post-exposure
prophylaxis. It is hoped that this boy will not
have major sequele which then supports that just
routine intensive care support is sufficient and
what has been expressed in "viewpoint of
management of human rabies (2008)" holds true
that intensive care support should be applied to
a patient who has antibody in the serum and in
CSF at admission. To prolong death in patients
who do not have antibody since the beginning may
not be beneficial. As in our study in rabies
infected dogs (J Neurovirol 2008), cytokine mRNA
transcripts is only a transient phenomenon in the
brain. It appears during the early stage (not
very prominent) and disappears thereafter.

It is great to know that there was another
survivor of rabies but keep in mind that this may
not at all be due to the chemicals or deep
anesthesia which was provided but due to good
nursing and ICU care. This case is virtually
identical to that of the 6-year-old Ohio boy who
had neither antiviral chemicals nor even
intubation; only good nursing care. The Brazilian
patient had significant CNS antibodies early in
the course of his illness which is something we
have not seen in the over 100 rabies patients
that we followed in Bangkok. We infused HRIG
intravenously (900 mL total) into one patient and
found that the antibody did not appear in CNS
fluid, indicating that the BB [blood-brain]
barrier remains intact in most if not all cases.
Thus, I would assume that the antibody in the
Brazil, Wisconsin and Ohio patients were produced
in the CNS and may have played a significant role in recovery.

I stand by our recommendation, made in the
referenced paper above [Wilde H, Hemachudha T,
Jackson AC. Viewpoint: management of human
rabies. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg 2008 May 15],
that we would treat any patient who is still
reasonably intact and has antibody in CNS on or
shortly after admission with high quality
standard ICU care without the Wisconsin regimen
which only adds to risks and is unlikely to
contribute to recovery or could be carried out in
most locations where rabies is common. The real
issues in rabies for today are not related to
these rare recoveries but to how we manage to
control the vector: the huge numbers of free
roaming dogs in most rabies endemic countries. We
still do not have an answer for this nor do
governments have the will to tackle it.
