Oil palms are grown on 350 000 hectares [approx 865 000 acres] in
Colombia, though the potential is 10 times that area. Many Colombian
plantations are completely renewing their oil palm stands due to
severe attacks of bud rot disease (_Phytophthora palmivora_). This
disease and other constraints are severely affecting small scale
(less than 5 hectares [12 acres]) palm growers who were previously
earning at least USD 1500 per month selling palm for oil extraction.
Critically, farmers' production losses also represent lost employment
for farm hands who are typically economically disadvantaged.

Growing maize offers a profitable hedge for all while producers wait
for the new generation of oil palms to come on line. Maize hybrids
have been tested in trials in 4 oil palm plantation zones, and the
results have been good. Maize also offers a profitable alternative
for farmers in marginal zones who grow coconut palms and have lately
been threatened with total crop loss from the lethal yellowing
diseases.

[Bud rot is one of the worst diseases of palms. In Latin America,
tens of thousands of hectares of oil palms (_Elaeis guineensis_) are
affected by bud rot diseases. Bud rot has destroyed entire estates in
Panama, Colombia, Suriname, Brazil, and Ecuador and is holding back
the development of oil palm cultivation in the region. The fungus
_Phytophthora palmivora_ as well as other pathogens and possibly also
environmental factors are thought to be involved.

_P. palmivora_ is known to affect more than 150 tropical host
species. It also causes, for example, black pod of cocoa and is the
main pathogen of bud rot of coconut and other palms in Southeast
Asia. Symptoms start with discolouration of the spear leaf followed
by extensive frond rots as the infected leaf unfolds. The rot
progresses into the leaf base killing the single growing bud and thus
eventually the tree. Disease incidence is usually more severe in high
humidity. The fungus is spread by insects, mechanical means, plant
debris, rain, and wind, and it can remain dormant in the leaf base
during times of dry conditions. Disease management includes cultural
practices (phytosanitary measures, nutritional improvements), removal
and burning of severely affected palms, and fungicide treatments of
palms at or before onset of symptoms. Breeding programmes using
possible bud rot resistance genes from _Elaeis oleifera_ (which is
indigenous to the Americas) are in progress.

Lethal yellowing (LY) diseases are caused by phytoplasmas of the palm
lethal yellowing (LY or 16SrIV) group. A number of LY strains have
been described from the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, and
southern Asia. LY has seriously jeopardised coconut industries in the
respective areas and can also affect a large number of other palm
species. Symptoms include premature nut drop, blackening of
inflorescences, yellowing of fronds, and death of the palm usually
within 4 to 6 months. The planthopper _Myndus crudus_ is suspected to
be the vector in the Americas, but different vectors may be involved
in the spread of LY strains elsewhere. Seed transmission of the
pathogens cannot be excluded and some weed species may serve as
reservoir hosts. Commercial control of LY relies on replanting with
resistant varieties, but an unexplained resistance breakdown of some
widely used Malayan Dwarf hybrids is causing great concern. Reasons
for the breakdown are still uncertain.
