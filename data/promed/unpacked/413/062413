Drug-resistant salmonella on rise in U.S.
The risk of being infected by drug-resistant salmonella bacteria is
increasing dramatically and the continued practice of feeding antibiotics to
livestock is exacerbating the problem, researchers said Thursday. Salmonella
poisoning strikes up to 4 million Americans a year, killing about 500.
Caused by eating contaminated food, it is characterized by sharp stomach
pains, fever and diarrhea and usually lasts from two to five days. One
strain of the salmonella bacteria, known as [_Salmonella typhimurium_]
DT104, is quickly becoming resistant to a wide range of antibiotics.
A study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine said laboratories
across the United States were finding a greatly increased incidence of
resistant bacteria when testing salmonella samples for resistance to five
common antibiotics. The drug-resistant salmonella bacteria were found in
just 0.6 percent of samples in 1979. By 1996 the prevalence had risen to 34
percent, researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) reported. Using data from three sources, Kathleen Glynn and
colleagues discovered that "in the past five years in the United States
there has been widespread emergence of a strain" resistant to five major
antibiotics. They estimated the resistant bacteria were infecting between
68,000 and 340,000 people each year. Most would recover on their own but if
doctors needed to treat them because they got very ill, several common
antibiotics would be
ineffective.
