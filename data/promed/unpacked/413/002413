An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Pamplona has now affected 61
people, 31 of whom have had to be hospitalized. One woman is in
intensive care, but the rest are all reported to be improving.
30 cooling towers in the area of the Ensanche de Pamplona were tested
on Friday [2 Jun 2006], and the bacterium was found in 4 of them. A
helicopter watch also revealed 8 cooling towers that the regional
government inspectors had no idea even existed.

[In the absence of human cases of legionellosis, _L. pneumophila_ may
be found associated with cooling towers. Additionally, finding both
colonized water towers and human cases do not prove cause and effect
without the typing of bacterial isolates.
Pamplona is located in the northeastern Aragon region of Spain. A map
showing the location of Pamplona can be found at
