AVIAN INFLUENZA A (H5N1) VIRUS, HUMAN VACCINE (06)

[This thread has been temporarily reconnected to enable Dr Jim Robertson
and Dr John Wood to make the following statement relating to the
ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, human vaccine (05)
20040403.0917", which contained an article from the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution under the heading: "NIBSC Wins Race to Genetically
Engineer H5N1 Vaccine Strain." - Mod.CP]
We would like to point out that the only race in developing an H5N1 avian
influenza vaccine strain was against time and nature and not against our
colleagues in the USA at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and St Jude Children's Research Hospital. The 3 labs concerned have
worked together, exchanging information and reagents that have accrued in
the process of developing the vaccine strain. As occurs with the annual
development of vaccine reference strains, the development of a pandemic
strain should not be left to a single laboratory, as the success in
developing a strain that is suitable is subject to many factors, some of
them unknown. There is still no guarantee that the virus developed by NIBSC
will be an effective vaccine strain, and the strains developed elsewhere
will also be evaluated. Since the avian influenza in east Asia presented an
extremely serious public health issue, speed was of the essence, and so it
was for this reason, and this reason alone, that the various labs involved
have worked non-stop on this matter. We are pleased to have been
successful, but find it objectionable and disreputable that some have cast
the project as a race against our WHO colleagues.
