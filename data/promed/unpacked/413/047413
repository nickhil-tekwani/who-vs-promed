Campaigners demanded a public inquiry today after 4 cases of potentially deadly legionnaires' disease were confirmed in South London. The cases have surfaced in Croydon but no link between them has yet been established.

The 4 patients are understood to be undergoing treatment at Croydon University Hospital. Cases are being investigated jointly by Public Health England, Croydon council, and Croydon Health Services NHS Trust. Tests have already established that 2 of the cases have different strains from each other. Dr Barry Walsh, a director of health protection for Public Health England, said: "We have been pursuing all potential sources of infection and taking histories of the movements of patients. There is no current link between any of these 4 cases [that] would suggest a common source of infection."

Legionnaires' disease is a serious lung infection, caused by bacteria, [which] can lead to pneumonia. Initial symptoms include a flu-like illness with muscle aches, tiredness, headaches, dry cough, and fever.

[For a discussion of legionnaires' disease, see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail posts Legionellosis, fatal - Germany: (BY, BW) 20100129.0314 and Legionellosis - Spain: (CT) 20130901.1916014.

We are told in the news report above that the 4 cases occurred in the London borough of Croydon but no link between them has yet been established; and that the _Legionella_ causing 2 of the 4 cases of legionnaires' disease are not identical, but we are not told if their species differ, serotypes differ, or genotypes differ. Both legionnaires' disease due to _Legionella pneumophila_ and that due to _Legionella longbeachae_ have been reported from the UK (see ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - UK: (Scotland) L. longbeachae, compost, fatal 20120529.1148827). In any case, a common source for at least these 2 cases is unlikely. More clinical, epidemiological and microbiological information on these cases would be greatly appreciated.

The River Thames divides Greater London into 2 parts. The southern part includes 12 boroughs, one of which is Croydon. Croydon is the southernmost borough of London and the largest by population (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_London).
