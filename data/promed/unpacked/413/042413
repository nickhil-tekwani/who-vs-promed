State health officials say 2 laboratory-confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease have been linked to an Albert Lea hotel.

The Minnesota Department of Health today [9 Jul 2021] issued an advisory warning anyone who stayed at the Ramada by Wyndham Albert Lea in late June [2021] and spent time in the pool/hot tub area to seek medical care promptly if they are ill.

Officials say they have identified 2 laboratory-confirmed cases, so far, among people from unrelated groups who were at the hotel and spent time in the pool/hot tub area the last weekend of June [2021]. They became ill in late June and early this month [July 2021] and both were hospitalized, although one of the patients has since been discharged.

According to the news release, Legionnaires' disease is spread by inhaling the fine spray from water sources containing the bacteria [_Legionella_ species] that causes the illness. The incubation period can be up to 2 weeks.

The State Health Department says investigators are working with the hotel to pinpoint the source of the bacteria. The hotel spa was shut down for maintenance on 29 Jun [2021] and the pool area is currently close[d] to guests while it is cleaned and decontaminated.

The symptoms of the illness include fever, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, chills, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, and coughing. Health officials note most people exposed to the bacteria do not develop Legionnaires' disease. People over the age of 50, smokers and former smokers, and people with certain medical conditions face an increased risk of becoming ill.

[The news article above reports 2 people from unrelated groups who stayed at the Ramada hotel in the town of Albert Lea, Minnesota in late June 2021 developed laboratory-confirmed Legionnaires' disease. The Minnesota Department of Health apparently believes the source is the hotel's pool/hot tub. Hot tubes are frequent sources for Legionnaires' disease outbreaks (see the See Also section below).

A cluster usually refers to multiple cases in space and time that are possibly linked. An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease implies a common source is suspected (https://legionnaires.ecdc.europa.eu/?pid=205). Genotyping the clinical isolates helps establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease is based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. We will await further findings from the investigation of the 2 cases.

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a _Legionella_-contaminated plumbing system by showerheads, sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; also, the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/).

_Legionella pneumophila_, the usual _Legionella_ species causing legionellosis in the USA, has been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Albert Lea, with a population of 18 016 residents in 2010, is the county seat of Freeborn County, in southern Minnesota, about 90 miles (140 km) south of the Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota).
