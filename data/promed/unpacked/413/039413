On Monday [12 Jan 2009], 77 new suspected and confirmed cholera cases were
reported in South Africa. There were 64 new suspected cholera cases
reported in Limpopo and Gauteng. A total of 13 confirmed cholera cases were
reported in the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and North West.

Limpopo Water Affairs chief director Alson Matukane said ongoing tests of
water resources in the province indicated that parts of the Tubatse River
in the Steelpoort area were contaminated with cholera. However, he said
other parts of the river tested negative. "It seems areas that tested
positive are where people use plastic containers to carry water," he said.
Matukane said they were still investigating if the water was contaminated
by human beings or the environment.

Limpopo health spokesperson Phuti Seloba said about 48 new suspected cases
were reported, taking the total number of those affected by the disease in
the province to 1802. He said 11 of the 48 new cases were reported in the
areas where the Tubatse River tested positive. The province's cholera death
toll remained at 9.

Meanwhile, the number of new cases had increased in other South African
provinces. Gauteng health spokesperson Phumelele Kaunda reported the 2nd
highest increased number of suspected cases at 16, bringing the total of
people affected in the province to 160 from Friday's [9 Jan 2009] 144. Of
the 160 suspected cases, only 30 were confirmed as cholera. The Gauteng
cholera death toll still stood at 3.

Western Cape health spokesperson Faiza Steyn said they had 7 confirmed
cases by Monday [12 Jan 2009]. The province had not had any cholera-related
deaths.

KwaZulu-Natal reported 4 new suspected cases in the Zululand district.
Spokesperson for the province's health department Chris Maxon said the
cases increased KwaZulu-Natal's confirmed number of cholera cases to 6.

The North West, which had reported 2 cases in December 2008, recorded 2 new
cases in the 1st week of January 2009. However, the province's health
spokesperson Nthabiseng Makhongoana said all cases had since been cleared.
Of the most recent patients, one was admitted to a private hospital and
another to a public hospital in Rustenburg. Makhongoana said one of the
patients, a Mozambican man, was discharged last week [5-11 Jan 2009] and
the other, a Zimbabwean woman, was released from hospital on Monday [12 Jan
2009].

Eastern Cape health spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said they had not had any new
cholera cases since the December 2008 single confirmed case.

from Zimbabwe.

At least 3 people were killed and 35 others hospitalized following the
suspected outbreak of cholera at Dokogi village in Nigeria's Niger state,
the News Agency of Nigeria reported on Sunday [11 Jan 2009]. The villagers
had alerted the authorities after a resident died from diarrhea and
vomiting. An eyewitness claimed that more people reported their cases as
the situation worsened, leading to the death of 2 more people. He said the
council later mobilized its medical personnel, including those of the
Federal Medical Center, Bida, to control the spread of the disease.

[4] Cholera - Tanzania (Mara)

Government medical experts have confirmed a cholera outbreak in 2 remote
villages of Kisoria and Bwanza in Bunda District, Mara Region. "Until today
(9 Jan 2009) there were 3 cholera patients admitted at an emergency health
camp that we have put in place in the affected villages and one them is due
to be discharged later today," Bunda district medical officer (DMO) Dr
Rainer Kapinga told the 'Sunday News'.

So far there have been no deaths caused by the disease that was first
reported on 24 Dec 2008 in the area, according to Dr Kapinga. "It is feared
that 2 people have died after undergoing severe diarrhea but we can't say
that it is cholera because they died before we confirmed the outbreak in
the area," Dr Kapinga explained.

Mara regional medical officer (RMO) Dr Stephen Kebwe also confirmed the
reports yesterday morning [9 Jan 2009], saying that the disease has only
been reported in the 2 villages of Bunda across the lake zone region.
