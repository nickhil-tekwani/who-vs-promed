Two women, personnel members of a city clinic in Armavir, have been
hospitalized with Siberian plaque in an infectious diseases clinic in
Krasnodar, the territory's administrative centre, a spokesman for the
local consumer rights supervision administration told Itar-Tass on
Friday [22 Apr 2011].

Preventive measures are being taken at the Armavir clinic, where the
women worked.

[The common name for cutaneous anthrax in eastern Russia is "Siberian
ulcer". That Itar-Tass used "plaque" would suggest that these are 2
cases of cutaneous anthrax. As this disease is rarely contagious, it
is likely that they got infected from handling contaminated meat
bought in the local market and happened to be also clinic workers,
perhaps in the clinic kitchen? Anthrax is more common in southern
Russia than our few reports indicate.
