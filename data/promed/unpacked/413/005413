Hope the following will be of some assistance. During the past decade,
dengue serotypes which have been confirmed by the National Institute of
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (Guayaquil) as circulating in Ecuador are
DEN-1, DEN-2, and DEN-4. Data from the Epidemiology Department of the
Ministry of Health, Ecuador, reveals that the annual incidence rates per
100,000 population for classical dengue from 1992 to 1996 have been 4.23;
72.99; 81.06; 29.66 and 44.3. As pointed out by C.H.Calisher (our Moderator
who has been doing a great job), the presence of _Aedes aegypti_, the
occurrence of sequential infections and the possible introduction of DEN-3
virus provides the potential for cases of DHF.

[If DEN-1, DEN-2, and DEN-4 viruses already are known to occur in Ecuador,
there is no need to import DEN-3 virus to begin seeing dengue hemorrhagic
fever. All the culprits are in place. It is simply a question of time. --
