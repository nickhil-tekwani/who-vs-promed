[Sheep pox and goat pox are viral diseases of sheep and goats characterised by fever, generalized papules or nodules, vesicles (rarely), internal lesions (particularly in the lungs), and death. Both diseases are caused by strains of capripoxvirus, all of which can infect sheep and goats. http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.14_S_POX_G_POX.pdf.

Sheep pox virus (SPV) and goat pox virus (GPV) were once believed to be strains of the same virus, but genetic sequencing has now demonstrated them to be separate viruses. Most strains are host specific and cause severe clinical disease in either sheep or goats, while some strains have equal virulence in both species. Further complicating this is that recombination can occur between sheep and goat strains, which produces a spectrum with intermediate host preference and range of virulence. SPV and GPV cannot be distinguished from each other with serological techniques, including viral neutralisation. (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/SHEEP_GOAT_POX_FINAL.pdf).

For more detailed information regarding laboratory diagnostic methodologies, vaccines, and references, please refer to Chapter 2.7.14 "Sheep pox and goat pox" in the latest edition of the OIE Terrestrial Manual at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.14_S_POX_G_POX.pdf.

Capripox is endemic in Africa north of the Equator, the Middle East, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, parts of the People's Republic of China, Bangladesh, and Viet Nam. Recently, it has made frequent incursions into southern Europe (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/SHEEP_GOAT_POX_FINAL.pdf).

Sheep pox and goat pox are not geographically restricted and can spread outside their usual range at any time (http://www.fli.bund.de/en/startseite/institutes/institute-of-diagnostic-virology/reference-laboratories/nrl-for-for-sheep-and-goat-pox.html).

Detailed information regarding safe international trade in terrestrial animals and their products, please refer to Chapter 14.10 "Sheep pox and goat pox" in the latest edition of the OIE Terrestrial Code at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.14.10.htm.

According to OIE WAHID database, from January 2012 to date (September 2013), the following countries in Europe reported sheep pox and goat pox:
Russia: July-December 2012, 7 outbreaks
Turkey: January-December 2012, 74 outbreaks (the disease is considered endemic)
Greece: January 2013 to date, 7 outbreaks
Except for the outbreaks reported in Russia, the disease in Europe seems to be limited to sheep.

It is not surprising that Bulgaria has submitted this immediate report for sheep pox and goat pox, because the disease is present in the Evros region of Greece (see the map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Diseaseoutbreakmaps Note: to view the map, scroll down to the name of the disease, choose the species and period), which is located less than 2 km [1.2 mi] from the Evros River that forms the border with Turkey, and 60 km [37.3 mi] from the border with Bulgaria (see http://www.defra.gov.uk/animal-diseases/files/poa-sheep-pox-greece-130819.pdf. - Mod.CRD
