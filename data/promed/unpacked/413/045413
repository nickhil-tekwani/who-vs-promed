[Note that the reporting interval is now midnight to midnight, presenting the full calendar day. In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 438 cases and 3 deaths.

Daegu province and Gyeongbuk provinces continue to have reported the highest number of cases, 4327 and 861, respectively. Daegu is completely surrounded by Gyeongbuk province in the central eastern part of South Korea. Daegu has been the epicenter of this ongoing outbreak. While several provinces are at or approaching 100 cases (Gyeonggi: 110, Seoul 103, Busan 92), the rate of growth in numbers of daily new cases appears to be at a much slower pace than that seen in Daegu and Gyeongbuk.

Coronavirus [COVID-19] has killed 92 people in Iran, officials said on Wednesday [4 Mar 2020], as the world's deadliest outbreak outside China spread to all but one of the country's provinces. Friday prayers too were canceled across all provincial capitals. The Islamic republic reported 15 new deaths from COVID-19 and 586 additional cases, bringing the overall toll to 92 dead and 2922 infected. "This virus doesn't have wings to fly. We're the ones spreading it," Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said.

The provinces of Tehran and Qom were the worst-hit with 253 and 101 new cases respectively. The Shiite holy city of Qom, south of Tehran, is the epicentre of Iran's coronavirus outbreak and where its 1st deaths were reported on [19 Feb 2020]. Authorities are scrambling to halt its rapid spread -- schools are shut, major cultural and sporting events suspended, and working hours reduced. Tehran's streets were considerably quieter than usual on Wednesday [4 Mar 2020], with few shops open. Many people wore masks as they walked along streets hung with large posters on preventing infection. Despite the preventive measures, the novel coronavirus is now present in all but one of Iran's 31 provinces, according to the latest figures.

[5] Environmental contamination
Date: Wed 4 Mar 2020
Source: JAMA [edited]
https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762692


ref: Ong SWX, Tan YK, Chia PY, et al. Air, surface environmental, and personal protective equipment contamination by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from a symptomatic patient. JAMA. Published online 4 Mar 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.3227
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Research letter
---------------
Coronaviruses have been implicated in nosocomial outbreaks (1) with environmental contamination as a route of transmission. (2) Similarly, nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been reported. (3) However, the mode of transmission and extent of environmental contamination are unknown.

Methods
-------
From [24 Jan 2020] to [4 Feb 2020], 3 patients at the dedicated SARS-CoV-2 outbreak center in Singapore in airborne infection isolation rooms (12 air exchanges per hour) with anterooms and bathrooms had surface environmental samples taken at 26 sites. Personal protective equipment (PPE) samples from study physicians exiting the patient rooms also were collected. Sterile premoistened swabs were used.

Air sampling was done on 2 days using SKC Universal pumps (with 37-mm filter cassettes and 0.3-microm polytetrafluoroethylene filters for 4 hours at 5 L/min) in the room and anteroom and a Sartorius MD8 microbiological sampler (with gelatin membrane filter for 15 minutes at 6 m3/h) outside the room (eFigure in the Supplement) [available at the source URL above].

Specific real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and E genes (4) was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (see detailed methods in the eAppendix in the Supplement) [available at the source URL above]. Cycle threshold values, that is, number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross the threshold in RT-PCR, quantified viral load, with lower values indicating higher viral load.

Samples were collected on 5 days over a 2-week period. One patient's room was sampled before routine cleaning and 2 patients' rooms after routine cleaning. Twice-daily cleaning of high-touch areas was done using 5000 ppm of sodium dichloroisocyanurate. The floor was cleaned daily using 1000 ppm of sodium dichloroisocyanurate.

Clinical data (symptoms, day of illness, and RT-PCR results) and timing of cleaning were collected and correlated with sampling results. Percentage positivity was calculated for rooms with positive environmental swabs. Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained as part of a larger multicenter study.

Results
-------
Patient A's room was sampled on days 4 and 10 of illness while the patient was still symptomatic, after routine cleaning. All samples were negative. Patient B was symptomatic on day 8 and asymptomatic on day 11 of illness; samples taken on these 2 days after routine cleaning were negative (Table 1) [available at the source URL above].

Patient C, whose samples were collected before routine cleaning, had positive results, with 13 (87%) of 15 room sites (including air outlet fans) and 3 (60%) of 5 toilet sites (toilet bowl, sink, and door handle) returning positive results (Table 2) [available at the source URL above]. Anteroom and corridor samples were negative. Patient C had upper respiratory tract involvement with no pneumonia and had 2 positive stool samples for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR despite not having diarrhea.

Patient C had greater viral shedding, with a cycle threshold value of 25.69 in nasopharyngeal samples compared with 31.31 and 35.33 in patients A and B (Table 1).

Only 1 PPE swab, from the surface of a shoe front, was positive. All other PPE swabs were negative. All air samples were negative.

Discussion

There was extensive environmental contamination by 1 SARS-CoV-2 patient with mild upper respiratory tract involvement. Toilet bowl and sink samples were positive, suggesting that viral shedding in stool (5) could be a potential route of transmission. Postcleaning samples were negative, suggesting that current decontamination measures are sufficient.

Air samples were negative despite the extent of environmental contamination. Swabs taken from the air exhaust outlets tested positive, suggesting that small virus-laden droplets may be displaced by airflows and deposited on equipment such as vents. The positive PPE sample was unsurprising because shoe covers are not part of PPE recommendations. The risk of transmission from contaminated footwear is likely low, as evidenced by negative results in the anteroom and clean corridor.

This study has several limitations. First, viral culture was not done to demonstrate viability. Second, due to operational limitations during an outbreak, methodology was inconsistent and sample size was small. Third, the volume of air sampled represents only a small fraction of total volume, and air exchanges in the room would have diluted the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the air. Further studies are required to confirm these preliminary results.

Significant environmental contamination by patients with SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory droplets and fecal shedding suggests the environment as a potential medium of transmission and supports the need for strict adherence to environmental and hand hygiene.

[This is an interesting look at environmental and other routes of transmission. While it is a small and limited look, it warrants follow-up in a larger study to understand better transmission routes and high risk transmitters, in this case, among those infected with the SARS-CoV-2. It is very interesting to see that an individual with a "mild" clinical presentation may well have been an ideal superspreader, if not for efficient respiratory precautions and adequate disinfecting/cleaning of the space occupied by this individual. In reverse, the 2 other patients did not appear to be high viral shedders, and may be an "opening of the door" into the varied R0s [basic reproduction numbers] speculated and observed. In outbreaks of SARS-CoV in 2003, a large proportion of the outbreaks (and resultant cases) were associated with "superspreaders". In Ontario Canada, 70% of cases were associated with one individual. Similarly, in the major MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea in 2015, 83% of transmission events were associated with 5 superspreaders.

A Princess Cruises ship that recently carried people who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus was being held in waters off California late on Wednesday [4 Mar 2020] as officials sent kits to test passengers and crew who had symptoms of the illness.

California governor Gavin Newsom (D) said during a news conference that he had asked that the Grand Princess, which left San Francisco on [21 Feb 2020] for a voyage to Hawaii, avoid returning to the state until testing could be completed. On Wednesday [4 Mar 2020] night, he said 21 people -- 11 passengers and 10 crew members -- were symptomatic and would be prioritized for testing, along with those who sailed on the previous voyage to Mexico with those who later became sick. "That number may significantly understate," he said. "It may indeed be an abundance of caution."

Princess Cruises said on Wednesday [4 Mar 2020] that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was investigating a "small cluster" of cases of the virus among people in Northern California who took a cruise on the Grand Princess from San Francisco to Mexico between [11 and 21 Feb 2020]. It did not say how many people were included in that cluster, and CDC did not respond to questions late on Wednesday [4 Mar 2020]. Princess Cruises also owns the Diamond Princess, which spent much of February [2020] quarantined in Japan. More than 700 people who were on that ship were infected and 7 have died.

Health departments in Placer and Sonoma counties in Northern California each announced one case of the virus among people who were on the voyage in recent days; one of those people has since died, Placer County Public Health said on Wednesday [4 Mar 2020], the 1st coronavirus-related death in California. Officials in Placer County said that person's "exposure likely occurred during international travel on a Princess cruise ship that departed from San Francisco to Mexico -- the same [11-21 Feb 2020] cruise associated with a confirmed Sonoma County case announced previously." The cruise line confirmed that the person who died was a 71-year-old man.

Newsom said state officials were working with CDC and health-care partners statewide to contact people who were on the manifest for the Mexico sailing, and that federal authorities were working to get in touch with those from outside the state.

Princess Cruises said on Wednesday [4 Mar 2020] it was canceling its Thursday [5 Mar 2020] stop in Ensenada, Mexico, to return to the United States. Initially, the line said the plan was to return to San Francisco on Thursday [5 Mar 2020], but Newsom said it would have arrived Wednesday night [4 Mar 2020] had he not intervened. "The CDC is continuing to actively collect information and is collaborating with us to determine what, if any, actions need to be taken during the current Hawaii cruise and upon the ship's return to San Francisco," the cruise line said in a statement. "We have shared essential travel and health data with the CDC to facilitate their standard notification to the state and county health authorities in order to follow up with individuals who may have been exposed to the people who became ill."

According to the operator, 62 people on the Hawaii cruise also sailed to Mexico with the passengers who later tested positive. Earlier on Wednesday [4 Mar 2020], the cruise line told those passengers and some crew to stay in their rooms until screened by medical staff on the ship. "You may order room service while you wait for the medical screening to be completed, and we apologize for any inconvenience," the line told passengers in an advisory that it also posted online.

The San Francisco Department of Public Health said the US Coast Guard and CDC are working with the cruise line and passengers, but said local authorities were also making "all the necessary arrangements to receive the Grand Princess." Late Wednesday [4 Mar 2020], Newsom said state officials would work closely with CDC and Coast Guard on establishing protocols for the ship's return. "We'll provide as much time as needed to secure the safety of everybody on board, secure their health, and then more broadly the community," he said. He added during the nearly hour-long news conference that it wasn't clear where the ship would eventually end up. "The question is where do they arrive," Newsom said. "There may be new protocols and procedures that send the ship to another location."

[This is now the 2nd cruise ship involved with the COVID-19 outbreak (the first being the Diamond Princess quarantined 3711 crew and passengers in Yokahama, Japan). The 1st event was a 2-plus week saga for testing and isolating infected individuals. On the outside looking in, it seems a lesson should have been learned that using the ship as a quarantine location is sub-optimal, as there aren't sufficient individual rooms for passengers and crew to maintain the requisite isolation from others to interrupt transmission. And reading the letter in section [5] above, detailing the identification of virus on multiple surfaces from a mildly ill individual, there are stairwell railings, deck railings, common eating areas with buffet meals, to name a few heavy trafficked areas that could harbor the virus on surfaces. -Mod.MPP]

*Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
**Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of sentinel samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

[The number of countries reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 76. This includes 9 countries from the Western Pacific region, 36 countries from the European region, 5 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 15 countries from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 8 countries from the Americas region, and 3 countries from the African region. 31 countries are listed as having local transmission within their countries, with Romania newly reporting local transmission. Local transmission was also noted on the cruise ship that was quarantined in Japan (the Diamond Princess).

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 12 668 including 214 deaths.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
