A vaccine could be available next year [2012] to protect horses from
the deadly hendravirus, which has killed 4 people in Australia.

The CSIRO [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organisation; Australia's national science agency] has announced that
it has made "successful progress" in developing the experimental
vaccine to combat the virus.

"Our trials so far have shown that the vaccine prevents the infection
of horses with hendravirus," Dr Deborah Middleton of the CSIRO's
Animal Health Laboratory said in a statement.

"A horse vaccine is crucial to breaking the cycle of hendravirus
transmission from flying foxes to horses and then to people, as it
prevents both the horse developing the disease and passing it on."

The vaccine could come into use in 2012 depending on how further
development and trials go.

Hendravirus first appeared in 1994 when it killed trainer Vic Rail
and 14 of his horses at the Brisbane suburb of Hendra.

The virus has claimed a total of 4 lives in 14 known outbreaks in
Australia.

The Australian Veterinary Association has welcomed the new vaccine
but is warning horse owners to continue measures to contain
hendravirus for the moment.

"It's important that veterinarians and horse owners continue with
precautions that reduce the risk of spreading the virus and that they
report suspected cases immediately," the association's president Dr
Barry Smyth said in a statement.

Almost 17 years after a mysterious illness killed Queensland horse
trainer Vic Rail, CSIRO scientists will today [see item 1 above]
announce they've developed a vaccine against the lethal hendravirus.

Deborah Middleton, a veterinary pathologist with CSIRO's Australian
Animal Health Laboratory [AAHL] in Geelong, will describe the vaccine
that protects horses against the virus, contracted through contact
with flying foxes.

Dr Middleton said stopping the disease in horses could also be the
1st step towards a vaccine for people. A US-made treatment involving
injection of microbe-fighting antibodies has so far not met
expectations. "It's very good news," said Queensland veterinarian Tim
Annand.

In 2009, he attended what would become the 13th and 14th cases of
hendravirus in horses. "It doesn't help us as humans directly, but it
means all horses could be required to be vaccinated before we see
them," Dr Annand said.

Hendravirus first appeared in 1994 and 5 of the 14 known outbreaks
spread to 7 people, the 1st killing Rail.

One of the 3 other people killed was Dr Annand's friend and
colleague, Rockhampton veterinarian Alister Rodgers.

Dr Middleton will tell delegates to the Australian Veterinary
Association [AVA] conference in Adelaide [15-20 May 2011] that if
field trials and registration progress as expected, the vaccine could
be available next year [2012].

AVA president Barry Smyth encouraged veterinarians and others who
come in close contact with horses to report suspected cases
immediately and continue "precautions that reduce the risk of
spreading the virus". According to Dr Annand, that means keeping
horses away from trees where flying foxes are feeding.

The vaccine is a collaborative effort between Dr Middleton's AAHL
group and one led by Christopher Broder of the US government's
Uniformed Services University. Funding here came from the Queensland
and federal governments. The scientists built on work at AAHL,
revealing that the virus, named for the Brisbane suburb in which it
was first observed, is part of a new sub-group, henipavirus, within
the family _Paramyxoviridae_.

Using that information, the team reported in the July 2008 issue of
the journal Vaccine that a so-called recombinant vaccine they'd
developed produced an immune response in cats exposed to the closely
related nipahvirus, also contracted from flying foxes.

In 2009, the international group reported they were able to
demonstrate that the vaccine's immune building capacity protected
animals from contracting the nipahvirus.
