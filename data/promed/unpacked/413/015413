Virus detected in Louisiana bass, but experts unconcerned
----------------------------
Largemouth bass virus (LMBV) has been detected throughout south Louisiana,
but experts say it should not deplete the area's fish population.
The virus was first detected in 1995 and is found throughout the South,
affecting fish, amphibians, and insects. Bass will probably build a
resistance to the virus, said Mike Wood of the state Inland Fisheries Division.
"Animals with resistance to the virus will live and reproduce and will tend
to pass on that resistance to their offspring. In this way, LMBV will
likely become just another pathogen existing in the environment but rarely
causing disease," Wood said.
State and federal experiments have been conducted on the virus, but there
are still questions about where, why, and how the virus has affected
Louisiana waters. Tests detected the virus in Henderson Lake,
Atchafalaya Basin, Lake D'Arbonne, Bayou DeSiard, Vernon Lake, Bundick
Lake, and Cross Bayou.
To prevent spread of the virus, officials ask anglers to clean boats and
equipment before moving to different bodies of water.
Wood said fish from infected waters are safe to eat.
The virus, which fish can carry without visible symptoms, does not always
result in death.
The virus caused 3 Louisiana fish kills in 2000, in Lake Bruin, Lake
Concordia, and False River.
