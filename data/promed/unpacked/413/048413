The discovery of HLB in Misiones alerts citrus provinces
--------------------------------------------------------
[A] National Programme for the Prevention of HLB meeting was held in Posadas, Misiones, during which the different actions to prevent the spread of the disease in the country were discussed; considering that 3 cases had been already confirmed in the north of Misiones, on the border with Brazil.

The National Service for Health and Food Quality (SENASA) reported the contingency plan that is being carried out in Andresito area where the 3 infected plants were detected. While isolated outbreaks have been found of the disease, those cases were found in non commercial areas.

It was agreed to maintain surveillance and carry out new monitoring in September [2012], which will be done together with other regions and provincial governments.

As for the eradication of [HLB] from nurseries, SENASA confirmed [they will] enforce regulations due to the high risk. The Ministry of Production of Corrientes warns of the risk of introducing plants from the area to Corrientes [from] Misiones.

[Huanglongbing (HLB; citrus greening) caused by _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops. The disease is restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of its vector. 2 other related pathogens, _Ca._ L. africanus and _Ca._ L. americanus and their specific vectors exist in the respective areas.

The disease affects both leaves and fruits. Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves and small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel, and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers, and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit.

_Ca._ L. asiaticus is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_), but it is also often spread by grafting and possibly seed transmission, and with infected plant material to areas where the vector is already present. Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards, and biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Biological control by interplanting of guava is being trialled (ProMED-mail post 20070912.3018).

The pathogen was reported for the 1st time in the Americas from Brazil in 2004 (ProMED-mail post 20040723.2012). Asian citrus psyllids were discovered in Argentina in 1994 in the Entre Rios area, and the North West region in 2006, but this appears to be the 1st report of the disease from the country. Infected insects, for example transported on plant material or carried by wind, will now pose a very high risk of spreading the disease to other areas and commercial orchards.
