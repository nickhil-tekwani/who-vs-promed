Tests point to SARS in Surrey; WHO official to view unusual lab results
----------------------------------------------
Genetic testing of blood and other samples from dead and ill Surrey
nursing home residents and workers is so far consistent with SARS,
the scientific director of Health Canada's National Microbiology
Laboratory in Winnipeg told The Vancouver Sun Monday.
Dr. Frank Plummer, who doubles as the director-general of the Centre
for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control in Ottawa, said the
results are so intriguing that a virologist from the World Health
Organization in Geneva is expected to visit the Winnipeg laboratory
today to view the samples.
Dr. David Patrick, chief epidemiologist with the B.C. Centre for
Disease Control, said a WHO representative is going to Winnipeg
because "it may be the first time in the world that the virus has
been found outside of the typical SARS picture," referring to the
fact that the virus may still be lurking, in a mild way, in many
communities, but B.C. is the first place to begin such a thorough
search.
The investigation has been prompted by the fact that since the
beginning of July 2003, 97 of 142 nursing home residents at the
Kinsmen Place Lodge nursing home and 46 of 160 staff have come down
with influenza-like symptoms. Visitors are not allowed in, residents
are discouraged from going out, and 19 employees at Surrey Memorial
Hospital who are healthy but who had contact with a nursing home
resident have been forced into quarantine as a precaution.
The female nursing home resident is in isolation at the hospital with
respiratory problems, and the patient has tested positive for the
specific coronavirus associated with SARS, or Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome.
Although he did not say B.C. is facing a SARS outbreak, the comments
by Plummer appeared to annoy B.C. public health officials, who want
to prevent people jumping to the conclusion that SARS has killed 7
nursing home residents since 1 Jul 2003, not to mention causing mild
illness in 150 nursing home residents and employees.
"We do not have severe acute respiratory syndrome here -- we have
some positive lab samples," insisted Dr. Roland Guasparini, chief
medical health officer for the Fraser Health Authority.
Dr. David Patrick, chief epidemiologist for the B.C. Centre for
Disease Control, also cautioned that the results from the Winnipeg
lab do not yet draw a direct line between the cold-like symptoms in
nearly 150 nursing home residents and staff at the Kinsmen Place
Lodge, because not enough of the SARS genome has been sequenced, and
the lab does not yet have sufficient samples to definitively say
whether a mutated or less severe SARS virus is circulating in the
community.
Both Patrick and Guasparini said the test is so new, it may be
yielding false positives. Plummer did not disagree. He said his
results are proof of laboratory, not clinical, findings. Plummer said
that lab testing done so far "is 100 percent identical to the SARS
coronavirus, and it is very unlikely that it is the common cold in
the coronavirus family that we are misdiagnosing."
Patrick said he is withholding his judgment until further testing is
done. "The lab may be seeing a microorganism that might be SARS and
if it is, then it is different from the illness which earlier in the
year was defined as a severe respiratory illness," said Patrick,
referring to the fact that in Toronto and China, SARS was contagious,
causing many deaths, while the current outbreak in Surrey is mild by
comparison.
Patrick said 7 nursing home deaths in 6 weeks is typical of the
mortality rate seen in nursing homes; of the 7 deaths, 3 were in
people with pneumonia-like symptoms, and 4 other deaths were
ostensibly from causes like cardiovascular disease.
He did acknowledge the virus could have mutated into something that
is causing less severe illness. Most medical experts agree it is
unlikely SARS just suddenly vanished. B.C.'s chief medical health
officer, Dr. Perry Kendall, said if the current outbreak is
conclusively proven to be SARS, he doubts B.C. is the only place
where the virus is circulating.
Experts agree that if it proves to be a disease that can cause few or
no symptoms, as well as life-threatening symptoms, it will have to
undergo a name change.
Plummer said scores of Canadians tested positive for the SARS virus
but never actually got sick last spring, and research is currently
under way in Toronto to determine whether they belong to a distinct
class of viral carriers who can unwittingly infect others and whether
they are like the current B.C. cases, who may get a mild version of
the virus.
In that study, Health Canada has found evidence of the coronavirus
linked to SARS in 172 out of 2000 people tested but classified as
neither suspect or probable cases. The Toronto samples were sent to
the Winnipeg lab because the people they came from were either
exposed to the virus at a hospital, had mild symptoms, were around a
sick family member, or had travelled to a SARS hot spot in Asia.
Patrick said since Plummer has confirmed the preliminary findings,
B.C. officials are now trying to send more tissue, blood, and other
samples from deceased nursing home residents and others who were ill,
so that more extensive testing can be conducted.
Pathologists preserve samples for several weeks, he said. "Our
priority now is to get more tissue so they can grow the virus and get
samples rich in genetic material. At this point, we can't say SARS
caused these deaths. We can only say that a test designed to detect
SARS found some positive results," Patrick said.
Guasparini said health officials here are now checking to see what
samples were sent to Winnipeg. He said he remains somewhat skeptical
about the laboratory findings because the genetic testing is too new
to be definitely foolproof. "Maybe if they tested everyone with a
cold, some would test positive," he said.
Also on Monday, Kendall announced that no new cases of illness have
been reported in residents and workers at the nursing home in the
past 3 days, and if the pattern continues, the quarantine on 19
health care workers will be lifted by 28 Aug 2003, at the latest. The
no-visiting policy at the nursing home will also be reviewed.
To prevent the spread of the illness to other nursing homes and
health care facilities, any Kinsmen employee who also works elsewhere
is being told not to go to the other job.

Surrey SARS virus confirmed, but questions remain
---------------------------
A nursing home in Surrey is dealing with an outbreak of the SARS
virus, not a SARS-like virus, says the director of Canada's National
Microbiology Lab.
Last week, it was reported that patients and staff at the Kinsmen
Place Lodge were falling ill, but were complaining only of minor
symptoms. So scientists at the microbiology lab in Winnipeg took the
"fingerprint" of 4 genes from the virus infecting the Surrey patients
and compared them [with the genes of] the SARS coronavirus that
plagued Toronto.
The lab's director, Dr. Frank Plummer, says that in 10 of the
specimens, his people got a perfect match.
"The little piece that we're looking at, so far, is 100 percent
identical to the SARS coronavirus," says Plummer.
But Dr. David Patrick of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control says the
results still don't make sense clinically. He notes the Surrey
patients were only mildly ill with runny noses and sore throats, and
that few had pneumonia or fevers, the classic symptoms of SARS.
"When we see the common cold in 48 staff members with no pneumonia,
that's not SARS. When we see the vast majority of even frail, elderly
patients only have common cold symptoms, that's not SARS," he says.
However, this isn't the first time patients in Canada have tested
positive for SARS, but weren't all that sick. The National
Microbiology Lab revealed in June 2003 it had 170 positive SARS
results in Ontario residents who had never been diagnosed with the
disease.
Dr. Plummer says the Surrey cases are more proof that SARS can vary
in its severity. "There's a very broad spectrum of illness caused by
this virus, and what we saw in the epidemic in terms of the very
severe cases is only the tip of the iceberg, and there's much more
out there."
One theory is that the SARs virus has actually been around for some
time, causing mild illness, but no one ever tried to test for it. And
then it mutated into something more virulent, causing the deadly
outbreaks in Asia and Toronto.
Meanwhile, 19 staff from Surrey Memorial Hospital and 4 staff from a
nursing home remain under quarantine.
One resident from the nursing home remains in isolation at Surrey
Memorial Hospital, and is listed in serious condition.

[The above newswires discuss the current laboratory evidence
suggesting that the virus responsible for this outbreak of a milder,
more flu-like respiratory illness may be related to the coronavirus
that was associated with the SARS outbreak. As the actual virus
involved in this outbreak has not been cultured, more information on
this is still pending. The newswires appropriately mention the
possibility that this virus may have been around for some time now,
but in the pre-SARS environment, these milder respiratory illness
outbreaks were not studied in great depth.
The information available in the newswires mentions that there have
been 3 deaths due to pneumonia, but have not mentioned whether the
pneumonia deaths were consistent with a primary viral pneumonia, an
ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome -- the pathology seen with
SARS), or a secondary bacterial pneumonia seen following viral
respiratory infections. We await further word from authoritative
sources on this outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
