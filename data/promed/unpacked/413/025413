Indian officials have re-imposed a lockdown in the southern city of Chennai (formerly Madras) and 3 neighbouring districts. Only essential services and neighbourhood grocery shops will be permitted to function under the 12-day lockdown, set to end on [30 Jun 2020]. Chennai is India's 6th-largest city and the capital of Tamil Nadu state.

It has more than 37 000 of Tamil Nadu's confirmed 50 000 infections, making it one of India's largest hotspots. With just over 600 deaths in total, the state has a relatively low mortality rate -- but its death toll is currently being reviewed after reports suggested that at least 200 deaths in Chennai were not included in the official tally.

It is the only city to re-impose a lockdown to curb the rise in infections. Thousands left days before the lockdown was set to begin. Local reports said vehicle check posts to exit the city were "clogged" with cars, and the Hindu newspaper reported that Chennai airport witnessed double the usual crowd in the past few days.

India now has the 4th-highest caseload in the world, with more than 350 000 confirmed cases of the disease. Daily reports of infections are spiking, with Tamil Nadu among the worst-affected states.

Earlier this month [June 2020], however, the country started to ease out of one of the world's harshest lockdowns, despite cases spiking across. It went into a strict lockdown in March [2020] when the confirmed caseload was in the hundreds. Official data suggests the decision prevented the loss of between 37 000 and 78 000 lives. However, the cost to the economy has been high and pictures of millions of informal workers leaving cities for their rural villages after losing their jobs -- some of them on foot -- shocked the country.

What's allowed under the new lockdown?
--------------------------------------
Grocery stores and petrol stations will be open, but only for limited hours during the day and with physical distancing norms in place. Taxis, auto-rickshaws, and private vehicles will not be allowed to operate, except in emergencies. "The public are advised to buy essential supplies without using their vehicles and from stores that are located within 2km (one mile) from their residences," chief minister Edapaddi K Palaniswamy said earlier this week.

Other things include:
- food delivery and takeaways are permitted though restaurants will remain closed to the public;
- state government offices and banks will be open, but with only 33% of staff in office;
- essential services like hospitals, labs, and pharmacies will continue to function as usual.

[Daily case counts have been above 8000 10 000 newly confirmed cases since 29 May 2020. The re-implementation of a short lockdown period may help in slowing down the transmission rates, but given the high population densities, especially in the larger cities, and in rural areas in highly populated states.

According to https://www.covid19india.org/, the most recent data for India, as of 18 Jun 2020, has reported a total of 381 320 cases and 12 605 deaths. State by state breakdown is:

The website https://www.covid19india.org/ has a map showing the geographic distribution and graphs showing the temporal trends and epidemic curves.

According to the Worldometer population webpages, India has an estimated population of about 1.38 billion people in 2020. Before jumping in with a comment re underreporting (which is present in most countries with high case counts, one factor that may play into the reported case numbers is the statistic that the median age in India is 28.4 years. With the majority of the population falling into the age groups that have lower severe clinical disease and estimated higher asymptomatic or mild illness from infection with the SARS-CoV-2, the overall reported cases may be lower than one might have expected before looking at the population distribution (https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/india-population/). The population size, combined with the high population density, makes social distancing challenging in many locations throughout the country.

[2] South Africa: rapid point of service breath tests, trials pending
Date: Mon 15 Jun 2020

In Hillbrow, a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa, researchers are gearing up to start a trial to assess a rapid breath test for COVID-19 to deliver results on-site in less than 5 minutes. If successful, the test would offer the advantages of being non-invasive, easy to use, and appropriate in settings other than hospitals.

"We believe that breath is potentially a powerful medium in detecting certain diseases early," says Mohammed Majam, the head of medical technologies at Ezintsha, an academic policy and research unit of the health sciences faculty at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits). "We are evaluating if this is the same for a virus like [SARS-CoV-2]. Our body responds immediately to the virus metabolically, and in the process, unique gases are produced. These gases are a signature of the virus and a breath test would be able to capture that," Majam, who previously worked on the evaluation of HIV self-tests for the World Health Organization in South Africa, tells The Scientist.

The investigators are waiting on approval from regulatory authorities to begin the test and work out the logistics of importing it into South Africa, as many tests suppliers have been affected by lockdown regulations. If all moves ahead, the scientists will use a sensitive, handheld device fitted with disposable nanosensors that pick up gases in a normal exhaled breath. For the phase 1 study, breath samples will be collected from 60 adults with positively confirmed COVID-19 and 90 negative controls. Ezintsha is assessing the product and the developer, US-based Canary Health Technologies, would commercialize it.

A cloud-based pattern-recognition technology will determine if a COVID-19 breath pattern can be established with accuracy. "This study at Wits will confirm the expected metabolic fingerprint of COVID-19 disease in the breath based on our assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on human body," Raj Reddy, the chief executive officer of Canary and inventor of the technology, tells The Scientist. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can initiate oxidative stress by a similar mechanism observed in other viral pneumonias, according to Reddy, with the production of highly reactive nitrogen oxide species. "This would in turn enhance the concentration of alkanes and oxygenated compounds that are exhaled from the breath. A larger load of distinctive biomarker molecules would eventually result in higher sensor response for patients with COVID-19 disease as compared to COVID-19 negative individuals," says Reddy. "Our differentially reactive sensor system is expected to generate a distinct pattern that can discriminate between people with COVID-19 disease and those without."

Scientists will then use the breath patterns to measure the sensitivity and specificity of the test when compared to a standard PCR-based diagnostic. Majam says he believes the test is very safe, as the disposable sensor prevents COVID-19 infected breath from touching the inside of the main device that is used to transmit the data to the cloud for analysis. The machine is disinfected between uses. "Any rapid test that could be used to identify infected individuals during this pandemic, especially those who are asymptomatic, is very important, says Burtram Fielding, a molecular biologist at the University of Western Cape who has been working on coronaviruses since 2003.

Diagnostic tests modeled around the same type of technology for asthma and lung disease are globally in use. The typical problems with these types of tests are that they are not very specific or sensitive, Fielding says. "This means that it could register false positives -- someone tests positive, but is not infected -- and false negatives--someone tests negative, but is indeed infected," Fielding tells The Scientist. The latter, he says, is of much greater concern as an infected person could spread the disease not knowing that they are positive. False positives could also be due to the test detecting the same biomarkers for other, less-dangerous coronaviruses or other types of viruses altogether.

As with all other rapid tests, this could make a good screening tool if the sensitivity and specificity are high enough, Fielding says. Used as a screening test, individuals testing positive could at least be isolated while they are tested by the confirmatory RT-PCR test, which is the gold standard. "Unless the clinical trial shows very high sensitivity and specificity, this would not be a very useful test during the epidemic of a virus with such a high infective rate," he says.

In May [2020], researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel announced they had developed a COVID-19 electro-optical test of nose, throat, or breath samples that looks for signs of the virus's presence itself and gives results in less than one minute. This product would cost approximately USD 50. Current PCR tests range between USD 45 and USD 70. "We believe we will be able to produce the tests at a significantly lower cost," says Majam.

Canary Health is discussing plans to conduct clinical trials on the device in the United Kingdom and the US, but a trial planned in Hong Kong won't go ahead now that there are very few COVID-19 cases, according to Anna Wang, Canary's senior vice president for corporate affairs.

"We will seek accelerated regulatory approval in South Africa as soon as they are confident of the performance, [and we hope] to have this test on the market before the end of 2020," Wang says.

[We usually do not post pre-phase 1 trials as many a good idea doesn't pass through phase 1 to phase 2, or from phase 2 to phase 3. But this struck me as a fascinating approach should it prove to be successful after a rigorous case control study protocol. As mentioned above and in prior posts, the need for point of care rapid testing is in great demand, especially in Africa where border crossings are points where passage of trucks carrying needed supplies and products are often delayed at the crossing for days or even 1-2 weeks awaiting PCR test results. In addition, international and domestic travel might benefit greatly by a rapid point of care test.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 63.7% of the global newly reported cases and 65.5% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. If one corrects for this within the region, note that there is a backlog of 31 422 cases reported today by Chile, thereby artificially increasing the proportion of new cases reported to WHO in the region, and proportion of newly confirmed cases reported by Chile relative to the other countries in the region. Adjusting the numerator and denominator within the region to account for the 4757 newly confirmed cases in the region reported by Chile, Brazil reported 41.5% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, USA reported 33.2%, Chile 5.7%, Mexico 5.5%, and Peru 5.0%. The same 5 countries at the top.

The European region reported 10.7% of the global newly reported cases and 13.8% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region, Russia reported 40.3% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Turkey 7.4%, Sweden 6.4%, the UK 5.8%, Ukraine 4.3%, and Belarus and Armenia at 3.4% each. Again, same countries, minor juggling of orders and percentages on a daily basis.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 11.1% of the global newly reported cases and 9.9% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 26.7% of the regional newly reported cases followed by Saudi Arabia 24.5%, Iran 13.0%, Iraq 7.8%, Egypt 6.8%, Qatar 5.5%, and Oman 4.0%.

The African region reported 3.8% of the global newly reported cases and 2.6% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 59.0% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 8.5%, Ghana 5.7%, Cote d'Ivoire 5.6%, Kenya 2.7%, Mauritania 2.5%, and Central African Republic 2.2%. While South Africa and Nigeria are consistently number 1 and number 2 in terms of 24 hour increase in cases, in the last 24 hours, other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.48% of the global newly reported cases and 0.19% of global fatalities. The Philippines reported 52.2% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 28.2%, South Korea 6.7%, Japan 4.6%, and China 4.1%. The outbreak associated with the Beijing Seafood markets continues to bring China to prominence in terms of daily newly confirmed cases.

The South East Asia region reported 10.2% of the global newly reported cases and 8.1% of global fatalities. India reported 69.4% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 21.6%, Indonesia 5.6%, and Nepal 3.2%. Same countries, same order as in previous days.

Impression: Europe seems to be stabilizing at a significantly lower rate, although Russia is still reporting 7000+ new cases a day (down from 8000+ per day). The Eastern Mediterranean has surpassed the European region with Pakistan reporting 5-6000+ cases a day and Saudi Arabia reporting 4000+ cases a day. South East Asia is approaching parity with the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions with India reporting 8000-10 000+ cases a day. The Eastern Mediterranean region has surpassed the European region for the past 3 days in terms of newly confirmed cases. The Americas region is reporting around 70 000 cases a day with Brazil usually reporting 25 000-30 000+ cases a day, and the USA at 20 000-25 000+ a day. In the Africa region, the regional proportion is slowly climbing, with South Africa reporting in the 3000-4000+ range daily, and in the Western Pacific region, they are maintaining a very low rate compared with the other regions, with the Philippines averaging 400+ cases per day (Singapore had been reporting twice as many cases per day for a period of time but has dropped back over the past couple of weeks).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 18 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia, which is approaching parity with the European region in terms of daily newly confirmed cases and the Eastern Mediterranean, which has overtaken the European region; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting, with an artificial major spike today related to the report from Chile including previously confirmed cases that had not been reported.. - Mod.MPP]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is "not applicable"; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.MPP]

Countries with more than 5000 cases not on the list above (as the list has grown longer, we froze the list and maintain a list of countries passing the 5000-case mark):

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 8 577 196, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count increased by 2.1% in the past 24 hours (influenced by the reporting of a backlog of previously unreported cases in Chile). The USA, with more than 2.26 million confirmed cases, now represents 26.4% of the global cases of COVID-19, as other countries such as Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases. A global total of 456 269 deaths have been reported, an increase of 5032 deaths in the past 24 hours. A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections are significantly underreported: actual numbers may be 10 to 20 times larger. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home, who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, the UK, Spain, Peru (surpassing Italy in the past 24 hours), Italy, Chile (overtaking Germany and Iran in the past 24 hours), and Iran at number 10. China is now number 21, having been overtaken by Qatar and South Africa in the past 24 hours. In descending rank order, Chile is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours [Note that many of these were from a backlog. See [3] above.], followed by the USA, Brazil, India, Russia, Mexico, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Peru, and South Africa -- all countries that are currently experiencing major community based transmission.

The top 20 countries in terms of absolute cumulative cases include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the Western Pacific region, unchanged in the past 24 hours. There are no countries from the Africa region. The top 20 countries with most newly confirmed cases include 7 from the Americas region, 5 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 from the European region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region, none from the Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.MPP]
