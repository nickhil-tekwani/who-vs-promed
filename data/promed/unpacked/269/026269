"Pakistan is hosting 1.4 million registered Afghan refugees for the last 4 decades while an additional number of 850 000 of the Afghan nationals are staying here as Afghan Citizens," said Qaiser Khan Afridi, spokesman of the UNHCR [UN high commissioner for refugees]. "If restrictions lifted and refugees are allowed to cross the border, a large influx is expected to arrive here due to economic hardship and harsh winter," he added.

Considered as the "poor's affliction" because of its occurrence in the rural and mostly slum dwellings, cutaneous leishmaniasis [CL] remained neglected by health teams until 2018 when an outbreak of the disease caused a largescale infection brought it into the limelight. In 2018 around 28 000 people were infected with CL in the tribal region and adjacent southern districts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa [K-P].

The outbreak gave way to the adoption of preventive measures, which helped in containing the disease and cases of the infection in K-P gradually dropped to 24 131 in 2019, 18 652 in 2020, and 11 390 in the first 10 months of 2021. In Balochistan, the cases were contained from 18 495 in 2019 to 13 457 in 2020, while this year a total of 9978 cases were registered until October 2021 in the province.

According to WHO's Country Profile for Leishmaniasis, Pakistan registered about 16 648 cases in 2015. Worldwide, around 700 000 to one million cases occur annually. "The Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), an international medical humanitarian association that came for the help of patients after the outbreak of CL in 2018, treated around 4946 patients in 2020 at its 3 centers established in Peshawar, Bannu, and Quetta cities," said Zahra Shoukat, the communication officer at the MSF Pakistan. "MSF is offering free-of-cost services to patients from southern districts of K-P and Balochistan where the disease is endemic," Zahra added.

"In Pakistan, both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis are prevalent but the high burden of CL is found in the southwestern province of Balochistan and K-P, located along the 2600-kilometer [1616 mi]-long porous border with Afghanistan," reveals a study entitled "Systematic review of leishmaniasis in Pakistan", published in the Journal of Parasitology on [6 Aug 2021].

"Leishmaniasis is widening its horizon from endemic to non-endemic sites due to rapid urbanisation, deforestation, and a large scale dispersion of the human population," said Dr Nazma Habib Khan, a PhD on Leishmania Diagnostics from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who was part of the team of three that conducted the above-stated study.

According to Dr Qaiser Khan, assistant professor at the Zoology Department of Peshawar University, leishmaniasis became prevalent in the country after spreading from its pocketed ranges in the bordering region. "We have around 17 to 18 species of sand fly and when it bites an infected person, the transmission cycle starts jumping from one human to another." The disease needs to be given due consideration by conducting research on the breeding cycle of sand flies, vector biology, infection control measures, and drugs used in the treatment, as currently, they are around 70 years old, he suggested. He also recommended adopting the "One Health" approach, involving multiple sectors to work together to achieve better public health outcomes, for finding out all the characteristics of the disease through the involvement of epidemiologists, entomologists, microbiologists, and ecologists as well.

The burden of disease was increasing in Balochistan as it has been reported in 17 out of total 33 districts, stated Dr Khalid Qumbarani, programme manager of the Vector Control Programme Balochistan. In an interview with APP, Dr Khalid said "our dependency was on the WHO in obtaining injections that provide 5000 vials on a yearly basis, while we need 300 000 vials for treating 12 000 registered and unregistered patients."

The K-P government purchased 170 000 vials from the WHO for treatment of CL patients, who are getting treatment in 71 centers set up in the province, said Dr Rehman Afridi, programme manager of the Integrated Vector Control Programme K-P.

"WHO is providing injections for treatment of CL free-of-cost but in limited numbers due to its non-availability in the open market," says Dr Muhammad Babar Alam, the head of the WHO sub-office. He appreciated the decision taken by the K-P government of purchasing injection as per the increasing number of patients. However, Dr Babar agreed that a refugee influx could raise the risk of an increase in infectious diseases because population density was the major source of the spillover of contagion.

Reference 2 concludes that "It was evident that the disease incidence has been on a gradual rise over the past few years. It was concluded that household clustering, house construction, and conventional behavioral practices (living with cattle) greatly impact the epidemiology of CL in the region." - Mod.EP
