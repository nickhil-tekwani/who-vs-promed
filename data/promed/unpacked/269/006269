Germany's federal health ministry said on Saturday that tests carried out
on Belgian eggs had revealed levels of the toxic chemical PCB
(polychlorinated biphenyls) exceeding national safety limits by up to 65
times.
The findings come hard on the heels of Belgium's dioxin food scandal and
the health ministry urged Brussels to widen its investigations into tainted
foods to include PCBs.
PCBs are highly poisonous and affect the nervous system if consumed by
humans. They are man-made chemicals that create dioxins when heated.
"Although some of the results were under legal safety limits, the suspicion
appears to have been confirmed that Belgian eggs may have been tainted with
PCBs as well as dioxin," the ministry said.
"Further investigations must clear up this matter," the ministry added in a
statement.
The tests were carried out by Belgian authorities on 8 batches of
fertilized chicken eggs intended for use in the breeding industry.
Their results were evaluated by Germany's Institute for Consumer Health
Protection and Veterinary Medicine, and were deemed by the German health
ministry to merit further action even though the eggs were not for eating
but for chick-rearing.
Separately, Germany's Spiegel news weekly reported that spot tests carried
out on Friday in North Rhine-Westphalia, a state bordering Belgium, had
revealed high levels of both Dioxin and PCB's in samples of Belgian eggs
and chicken products.
And some Belgian meat, imported into Germany before the recent
contaminated-food scare, was also found to contain high levels of PCB,
authorities in Hesse state said on Friday.
Tests on a batch of chicken burgers imported from Belgium, where
carcinogenic dioxin was found in chicken food sparking an international
clamp-down on Belgian food imports, revealed levels of PCBs way above the
highest acceptable amount.
The federal health ministry said on Friday it had ordered all 16 German
states to test Belgian food imports for PCBs along with the cancer-causing
dioxin after it was alerted on Thursday to the possibility that the toxic
chemical may also have been in the tainted meal fed to chickens in Belgium.
