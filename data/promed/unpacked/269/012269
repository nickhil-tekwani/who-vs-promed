WRLFMD Report: January-March 2007
---------------------------------
SUMMARY:
This document summarizes activities conducted at the FMD [foot and mouth
disease] World Reference Laboratory (WRL), Pirbright, from January through
March 2007, including information on FMD situation worldwide, results from
samples received at WRL, status of samples under test, antigenic
characterization of FMD field isolates by matching with vaccine strains,
and phylogenetic analysis of samples. The report summary follows:
For Europe and Asia, the issue of greatest concern is the emergence of a
highly transmissible lineage of the PanAsia strain of serotype O which has
spread from India to the east, north and west causing recent epidemics in
a number of countries in the Middle East. This picture somewhat mirrors
that seen prior to 2000-2002 when another O PanAsia strain spread into
several normally FMD-free countries including Taiwan, Japan, South Africa,
UK, France, Netherlands and South Korea. Although, the O Manisa vaccine is
predicted to provide protection against this new PanAsia variant, the
vaccine has a slightly poorer serological match compared to that which was
found against the O UKG 2001 PanAsia virus.
No outbreaks were officially reported in FMD-free countries that did not
practice vaccination and the disease remained largely confined to
traditionally infected areas between January and March 2007. However, FMD
continues to threaten the FMD disease-free areas of Europe. In particular,
in the past 3 months [Feb - Apr 2007] there have been separate outbreaks
of 2 FMD serotypes (O and A) in Turkey close to the borders of Greece and
Bulgaria. The 1st of these outbreaks (serotype A: Iran 05 lineage)
occurred in January [2007] and was briefly described in the previous
report. It involved 2 cattle that were clinically confirmed to have FMD in
the village of Ogulpasa (Edirne) near the border with Greece. Further
outbreaks (in February [2007], and more recently in early April [2007] in
cattle in Merkez, Kirklareli and Evrese in Cannakale respectively) have
occurred in western Turkey due to serotype O. The 1st outbreak was thought
to be linked to contact with wild boar, while the more recent outbreak was
reported to be due to the movement of cattle from Adapazari, Sakarya
Province. In an attempt to control these outbreaks in Thrace and adjacent
areas, 1.5 million doses of trivalent vaccine against FMD were supplied to
Turkey in March [2007] by the European Commission.
Elsewhere in the Middle East, there have continued to be reports of
outbreaks due to serotypes O and A. In Jordan, serotype A was confirmed in
the outbreak in East Amman in January [2007]; whereas serotype O has been
confirmed in the 2 outbreaks in Al Dilal, Az Aarqa and in Faqo Al Karak.
There have continued to be outbreaks (Jan-Apr 2007) of serotype O in
northern Israel in locations close to those reported previously at the end
of 2006. In addition to domesticated livestock, FMD has now also been
reported in a wild gazelle herd in the region. Interestingly, over the
past 3 months there has been an apparent movement southward of the disease
from Hazafon Province in the north, through the Palestinian Territory
(where more than 500 cases have been reported) to the southern Israeli
province of Hadarom where recent outbreaks in April [2007] have been
reported. The mode of spread has been suggested to be due to introduction
of new live animals, illegal movement of animals, and contact with
infected animals.[See commentary].
Asia: In North Korea, an FMD outbreak was recognised in January [2007] and
reported as due to serotype O. This outbreak in P'yongyan-Si close to the
capital, was the 1st FMD outbreak officially reported (to OIE) in the
country since 1960. All susceptible livestock (466 cattle and 2630 pigs)
in the outbreak were destroyed. In addition, there are plans to vaccinate
100 000 susceptible animals within a 70-km-radius zone. In China, further
outbreaks of serotype Asia 1 were reported in January [2007] (Gansu
Province and Xinjiang Province) and February [2007] (Qinghai Province). In
January [2007], there were also reports of a FMD outbreak in a Yuen Long
pig farm in Lau Fau Shan, Hong Kong. The campaign to rid Taiwan of FMD has
entered a critical period, with pig farms gradually halting the
vaccination in 5 phases. The government's ultimate goal is to obtain OIE
certification as an "FMD-free zone without vaccination" in 2 years.
Within FMD endemic regions of South East Asia, there were reports of
outbreaks in Vietnam and Malaysia. In Vietnam, the disease has appeared in
25 communes in 9 provinces, namely Lai Chau, and Phu Yen, Quang Nam, Quang
Ngai, Khanh Hoa, Quang Binh, Binh Dinh, Dac Lac, and Thua Thien Hue. By
March 2007, outbreaks were restricted to 4 Vietnamese provinces in the
centre and north of the country. In Malaysia outbreaks of FMD were also
reported (in January 2007) in cattle in Terengganu. Investigations showed
that the source of the disease was livestock that were not covered in last
year's [2006] vaccination exercise. Addition outbreaks were also reported
in mukim [a subdivision of a daerah (district) in Malaysia] Ulu Melaka,
and Kampung Nyior Chabang in mukim Bohor and Jeli where it is believed
that illegal movement of affected cattle had contributed to the spread of
disease.
Africa: As a consequence of theSAT 3 outbreak in South Africa (August
2006), 2 rounds of vaccination combined with mouthing inspections of all
cattle have been undertaken in the affected area (Limpopo). In the absence
of any clinical disease, the OIE has now declared the area free from FMD.
Following the outbreak last year of SAT1 in Botswana, the affected herd
(in the entire district of in Muchenje) was vaccinated in December 2006.
No new cases were noted after this vaccination followed mouthing and
clinical inspection of feet for signs of FMD. Consequently Botswana has
applied for re-instatement of FMD-free status that was lost due to the
outbreak. There have been no additional outbreaks of FMD in Guinea since
the last report.
South America: Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay have agreed to a 15km zone
of intensive surveillance along their common borders. This agreement was
proposed after an expert OIE mission visited the region and concluded that
FMD virus was still circulating along the shared borders of the 3
countries. In addition, in January [2007], Argentina presented a request
to the OIE to expand the FMD-free area without vaccination to include Rio
Negro Province. Currently, only the Argentine territory south of the 42nd
parallel is considered FMD free without vaccination by the OIE.
It is estimated that 99.45 percent of cattle in the State of Mato Grosso
(Brazil) have been vaccinated during the last FMD mass vaccination
campaign, which finished in November 2006. Subsequent seroepidemiological
surveys have been carried out to evaluate virus circulation in this state.
A cluster of positive reactors cattle was discovered in the municipalities
of Japor, Eldorado and Mundo Novo. From February [2007] 30 000 cattle from
this region were pre-emptively culled to reduce the risk of FMD spread.
Elsewhere in South America, there have been new outbreaks of FMD (serotype
O) reported in Boliva and Ecuador. Outbreaks affecting mainly cattle
reported January and February [2007] in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. These were
considered to be under control by March[2007]. In Ecuador, 2 separate
provinces were affected by FMD. The 1st cases were in January 2007 (Azuay)
and subsequent outbreaks were in March [2007] (Imbabura). Both outbreaks
affected pigs and were attributed to introduction of new animals.
The WRL vaccine recommendations remain unchanged. During 2005, A Iran 96
and A Iran 99 vaccines were replaced in the Middle East with A22 Iraq
vaccines to counter the incursion of A Iran 05 viruses. No recurrence of
viruses related to A Iran 96 or 99 has been seen, and if this pattern
continues, the high priority for inclusion of these 2 vaccine strains will
need to be reviewed.

[The spread of the virus in the territories of Israel and the Palestinian
Authority, which continued throughout Apr 2007, seems to have peaked by
now. The WRL report, includes also the following comment: "Further
analysis of serotype O viruses from the Middle East (Jordan, Israel and
UAE) has been performed. All these viruses are derived from the PanAsia
strain circulating in the region and closely related to each other (and
other viruses recently received from other countries in the region)".

Another useful FMD update (2005-2006) is the Focus review "Foot-and-Mouth
Disease Situation worldwide and major epidemiological events in
2005-2006", prepared by FAO EMPRES and EUFMD Commission Secretariat. It
includes maps of the various regions, with special reference to Turkey.
