A measles outbreak in Venezuela, the first in 4 years, has been reported to
the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). A total of 12
laboratory-confirmed cases were notified by the Ministry of Health of
Venezuela, 10 in Miranda and 2 in the capital district. Four other probable
cases are being investigated.
The first measles case was reported in a 33 year old airline pilot from
Miranda who traveled to Madrid in February 2006 and became ill on his
return. The case was confirmed as measles in a private clinic and resulted
in an outbreak among direct contacts of the patient, including 5 children
under 14 years of age and 4 adults over 30 years old.
Venezuelan health authorities responded immediately with control measures,
increased surveillance, case investigation, and vaccination in areas where
the people affected by the outbreak live and work. So far, some 67 000
vaccinations have been administered. Links have been established between
health authorities, PAHO/WHO, Venezuelan medical societies and private
clinics to disseminate information about the outbreak and control measures.
Since the goal of measles elimination was adopted in September 1994 by the
countries of the Americas, measles incidence has decreased by more than 99
per cent in the Americas. Transmission of the D6 measles virus genotype --
which began in 1995 and caused large outbreaks in Argentina, Bolivia,
Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti -- was interrupted in September
2001. The subsequent transmission of the D9 measles virus genotype in
Venezuela was interrupted in November 2002, 14 months after it had started.
The previous Venezuelan outbreak was viewed as the last instance of
widespread endemic transmission of the measles virus in the Americas.
Dr Jon K Andrus, chief of PAHO's Immunization Unit, said, "As long as
measles eradication is not pursued globally, imported or import-related
measles cases will continue to occur in the Americas. However, the
experience in several countries shows that, when high coverage with
measles-containing vaccine exists, reliable detection and aggressive
follow-up of suspect cases will limit the consequences of measles virus
importations."
So far in 2006, confirmed measles cases have also been reported from Mexico
(22 cases), the United States (3 cases), and Canada (1 case).
PAHO, which works to improve health and raise living standards in all the
countries of the Americas, was successful in eradicating polio from the
Western Hemisphere in 1994.

[Recently an unusually large outbreak of measles in the Khmelnizkiy region
of Ukraine was described in ProMED-mail (see references below). The D6
genotype of measles virus appeared to be associated with this outbreak.
Other sporadic cases of D6 genotype measles virus infection were observed
at the same time in both adjacent and more remote countries and were
considered to be imported cases: 2 cases in Belarus, 9 cases in the Russian
Federation, 2 cases in the United States, and one case in Spain. If it is
established that a D6 genotype measles virus is responsible for the
Venezuelan outbreak, this outbreak may also be linked to the Ukrainian
outbreak since the index case appears to be an airline pilot who contracted
infection in Spain. - Mod.CP]
