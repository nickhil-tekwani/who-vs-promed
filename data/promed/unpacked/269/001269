[While this posting has information on both human and avian influenza
issues, the human case information is not new as there are no
additional human cases having been confirmed at this time. The avian
influenza reports though are new, as a a new outbreak is suspected in
a neighboring province not having reported avian influenza in the
past. Hence, the decision has been taken to include this posting in
the avian influenza thread. - Mod.MPP]

Cambodia: Local media reports bird flu not yet contained
-----------------------------------------------
Two siblings of Cambodia's 7th human bird-flu fatality victim who had
initially reported symptoms were improving, but the sudden deaths of
chickens in a neighboring province raised new concerns, local media
reported on Sunday [8 Apr 2007].
The Rasmei Kampuchea newspaper [a Phnom Penh daily newspaper] quoted
local health officials as saying 2 children aged 8 and 11, believed
to be siblings of a 13-year-old girl who died of the H5N1 strain of
avian influenza [see: Avian influenza, human (68): Cambodia,
Indonesia 20070406.1161], had earlier been feared to have contracted
the disease but now appeared to be improving. The dead school girl
had tended her family's small flock of chickens in the Ponhea Kret
district of eastern Kampong Cham province, according to local residents.
The Rasmei [newspaper] quoted local officials as saying that several
were under observation in the area surrounding Phany's home and that
68 ducks and nearly 300 chickens had died in the vicinity before and
after the girl fell ill last Monday [2 Apr 2007]. Health Ministry
official Ly Sovann told Radio Free Asia that local authorities were
investigating reports of mass deaths of chickens in neighboring
Kratie Province.
The school girl was the 1st confirmed human death [in Cambodia] from
the disease since April 2006.

A 13-year-old girl died of the H5N1 bird flu in Cambodia marking the
7th human death since outbreaks began.
The death occured in the province of Kampong Cham on [5 Apr 2007].
The case though was isolated so that it appears no one else was or
will be affected in that outbreak.
All who were at the home and hospital of the girl were tested and all
came back negative. The representative of the World Health
Organization for Cambodia, Michael O'Leary, stated that the case
looks to be "isolated."
The girl was the 7th to die from the H5N1 bird flu in Cambodia. She
ate a chicken who was reportedly infected with the virus near her house.

[This is another unfortunate case of human influenza preceding the
identification of H5N1 infection in animals.
18 outbreaks of Avian influenza in domestic poultry have been
reported in Cambodia between its 1st outbreak of January 2004 in
layer hens, and the most recent reported outbreak of Aug 2006 (OIE
follow-up report at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_02.HTM#Sec5>) in free-ranging
ducks in the village Balaing, province Kompong Cham, the same
province where the current human case has been identified; map at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/cambodia.pdf>.
58 countries have identified H5N1 in wild birds or poultry since
2003; 16 countries have already reported the disease since the
beginning of 2007, including all Cambodia's neighbours, Thailand,
Laos and Vietnam. (see above map).
A wealth of information on Cambodia's AI situation, 2004 - 2006, is
available at FAO's web-site
<http://www.fao.org/ag/AGAinfo/eims_search/simple_s_result.asp>,
including background and 45 AI-situation reports. The 45th, last
report dates back to March 2006; there is an urgent need for an update.
Results of laboratory investigations from the recent suspected
outbreaks and data on the currently applied Cambodian control policy,
including culling procedures (hopefully with appropriate
compensation), public education and possible vaccinations, are
anticipated.- Mod. AS].
[As commented previously, the death of this patient was the 1st death
in Cambodia this year [2007] and the 7th death overall. All 7
confirmed human cases of avian influenza in Cambodia have been fatal.
Although 2 siblings of this 7th case have been under surveillance,
they are recovering, and there is no evidence favoring the occurrence
of a cluster of human cases that might be indicative of
person-to-person transmission.
