A church in Shelby NC is the focus of an investigation by state and county health officials searching for the cause of an outbreak of salmonellosis. The outbreak was first reported following the annual fund-raising barbecue at Sandy Plains Baptist Church on New House Road last Sat [7 Sep 2013]. Cleveland County and North Carolina health officials first said 9 people were sickened following the barbecue and 5 of those cases were serious enough to require hospitalization. On Wed 19 Sep 2013, the numbers jumped to 28 probable cases. 6 of them are confirmed in Cleveland County, 4 are confirmed in Rutherford County. All but 2 people who were hospitalized have been released.

"We certainly hate to hear that anybody got sick," said Pastor Garin Hall. He said as many as 5000 people attended the barbecue. Investigators have not said if they have identified the exact cause of the outbreak.

Pastor Hall said the church has always taken a lot of care in the way the food is prepared. "We have cookers that keep meat hot all the time and so we take a lot of pride in the way that we do it and try to do it well," said the pastor.
