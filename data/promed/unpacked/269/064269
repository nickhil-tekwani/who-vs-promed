[re: ProMED-mail: Chlamydiosis, koalas - Australia 20091007.3476]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The posting's suggestions that chlamydiosis is associated with
nutritional or other stress caused by habitat loss, and that koalas
are "dying of stress" has no basis of scientific evidence. These were
hypotheses put forward over 20 years ago, were never rigorously
tested, but nevertheless have become dogma [see
<http://www.thekoala.com/koala/#THREATS>].
In fact recent scientific data tend to contradict these hypotheses,
as do some of the statements in the posting itself.

We operate a wildlife hospital that treats approximately 600 sick and
injured wild koalas each year. Many very sick koalas come from good
habitat, with low koala densities and little in the way of habitat
pressure. One of our current research streams is examining disease
prevalence, incidence, and severity in a number of south east
Queensland koala populations. There appears to be no correlation with
habitat "stress".

The implication of accepting such dogma as truth is that so long as
we protect some good areas of koala habitat, the remnant koala
population will have a low prevalence, incidence, and severity of
disease (and therefore, presumably, be viable). From a conservation
management point of view this is a very dangerous assumption. There
is scientific evidence emerging that koala populations even in
"secure" habitat are in rapid decline (Department of Environment and
Resource Management (DERM). 2009, Decline of the Koala Coast Koala
Population: Population Status in 2008 (a Queensland Government
report), available at
<http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/register/p02966aa.pdf>).

Our hypothesis is that koala retrovirus infection modifies the immune
response in some infected koalas leading to increased susceptibility
to development of chlamydial disease following exposure to the
organism; and a higher likelihood of severe, debilitating (or fatal)
disease, compared with koalas with normal immune responses. Koala
retrovirus infection is widespread in koalas, and has become
endogenous in Queensland and New South Wales koalas. Although it has
been detected in southern koalas, preliminary data suggest that it
may not have spread to the [same] extent, or endogenised in some of
those populations. Interestingly, in some of those southern koala
populations, the density of koalas is high, the habitat is suffering
from overbrowsing by koalas, and yet the severity of chlamydial
disease is quite low, and more consistent with that seen in
immunocompetent animals and humans.

Clearly our hypothesis should, and is, being subjected to rigorous
scientific investigation.

[Ian Douglas, AGAH FAO, has provided a useful Australian Wildlife
Health Network link on retrovirus infections in Koalas:

Patently this is a complex but extremely interesting condition, whose
disentangling will be challenging. It always amuses me that we
epidemiologists insist on tight definitions and then go with a
convenient soft hypothesis. It is about time this stressed koala
hypothesis was challenged. - Mod.MHJ]
