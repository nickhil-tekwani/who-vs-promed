Puckering up to a bearded dragon can damage your health. NHS Forth Valley has warned owners to avoid kissing bearded dragons, as most reptiles carry salmonella in their gut without showing any signs of infection. These bacteria are then shed in droppings, which can quickly spread over the skin of pet lizards and other reptiles. As a result, any surface or object that the animal comes into contact with can be contaminated, such as toys, clothes, furniture, and household surfaces.

NHS Forth Valley said that 4 people have been brought into hospital in the last 8 months suffering from the illness after kissing bearded dragons and other reptiles.

NHS consultant in public health medicine, Dr Henry Prempeh said: "While salmonella is not usually life threatening in healthy individuals, immunocompromised people, the very young, and the very old can have complications associated with this infection. Children are particularly at risk because they like to stroke and handle pets.

"I would appeal to people who look after bearded dragons to take strict hygiene precautions."

NHS Forth Valley have also issued a guide for pet owners to reduce the risk of catching salmonellosis from lizards, which includes supervising children to make sure they do not put the animal, or objects it has been in contact with, near their mouths. It also recommended washing hands with soap and water immediately after handling a reptile, its cage or any other equipment, keeping a reptile out of rooms where food it prepared or eaten, and disposing of droppings and waste water down a toilet, rather than in a sink or bath.

Bearded dragons are native to Central Australia, but have become increasingly popular pets in the cold climes of Scotland. Taking their name from their spiny throat projections, which resemble a beard, they are said to be great pets for older children, and can live for 10 years.

[Salmonellosis can be acquired from a variety of lizards, including these bearded dragons, snakes, turtles and iguanas. Appropriate hand hygiene is necessary to minimize this risk and directly kissing the animal would not be considered an appropriate behavior.

Pogona (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogona) is a genus of reptiles containing 8 species, which are often known by the common name bearded dragons. The term "bearded dragon" is most commonly used to describe the central bearded dragon, (_Pogona vitticeps_). Members of this genus live in the arid, rocky, semi desert regions and dry open woodlands of Australia. They are adept climbers, spending time on branches and in bushes and near human habitation. Pogona species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons. They are found throughout Australia. Several species of this genus, especially the central bearded dragon, are often kept as pets or exhibited in zoos due to their hardy nature and easy care in comparison to other exotic reptiles.
