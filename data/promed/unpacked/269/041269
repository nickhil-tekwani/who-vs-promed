[The incidence of infections caused by methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus
aureus_ (MRSA) has reached "epidemic" levels in UK hospitals, according to
a public health official. Professor Brian Duerden, deputy director of the
Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS), says incidents involving MRSA have
risen 12-fold since 1991 and are responsible for 37% of fatal cases of blood
poisoning, compared with 3% eight years ago.
Two particularly strong strains [presumed to mean isolates exhibiting high
MICs - Mod.ES of the bug are thought to be behind the rise in cases.
The PHLS has warned hospitals to tighten their measures for controlling
infections, such as basic hygiene rules, and GPs have been warned to reduce
prescription of antibiotics to avoid the development of resistance to them.
Wales and the West Midlands have experienced the greatest increase in
cases. The PHLS says incidence in the West Midlands has risen three-fold
since 1995, when there were 146 cases. Some 427 cases were reported in 1997.
Wales has had an eight-fold increase in the same period with 48 cases in
1995 and 393 cases in 1997.

[The increasing incidence of MRSA isolates will increase pressure to use
vancomycin for treatment of infections, and this could accelerate the
emergence of vancomycin-resistant strains of _Staphylococcus aureus_. -
