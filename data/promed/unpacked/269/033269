An Oswego County resident died of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) Tuesday
[15 Sep 2009], the Oswego County Health Department has announced.

The Oswego and Onondaga County Health Departments jointly announced Friday
[18 Sep 2009] that the resident had been diagnosed with EEE. Oswego County
public health director, Dr Dennis Norfleet, said the sex of the victim
could not be released. "EEE is a rare but serious viral disease that is
spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes," Norfleet said. "Its fatality
rate is high; between 30-70 per cent."

There have only been 2 other fatal cases of EEE recorded in New York state
-- one in 1971 and one in 1983. In addition, there have been 221 confirmed
human cases of EEE in the United States from 1964 -- 2004, according to the
New York State Department of Health website.
