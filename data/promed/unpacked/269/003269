[As reported in the above CHP report, there have now been reports of 429 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in China, with cases reported by 14 different provinces. There definitely has been a decreasing trend for incidence of human cases of influenza A (H7N9) in mainland China. A key question is whether this reflects seasonality of transmission, in which case one might expect to see another wave of infection with the onset of another seasonal increase in transmission.
