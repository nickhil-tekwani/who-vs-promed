Veterinarians and marine biologists are working around the clock to save
the turtles. In the last week, 45 of them have either died or become
critically ill. Vets aren't sure what's causing the pneumonia, but they
say it could be a virus or toxins in the water, or even the recent cold
spells.

[ProMED-mail would appreciate any additional information on this
subject. It is possible that the seagull die-off in Florida is related to
the turtle die-off, considering that they share the same geographic
location (South Florida), feed from the same sources and have similar
environmental exposures. - Mod.PC]
