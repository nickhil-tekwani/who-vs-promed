Leptospirosis disease on the rise in pets
-----------------------------------------
A potentially dangerous bacterial disease that can be fatal in
animals is on the rise, a local veterinarian warns. Dr Melanie
Butera, of Elm Ridge Animal Hospital, said she has seen an increase
in the number of dogs at her practice that have contracted
leptospirosis.

Leptospirosis, a contagious bacterial infection, is contracted when
animals -- and humans -- come in contact with the urine of wildlife.
"In 25 years of being a vet, I had never seen a true case of it until
3 years ago," Butera said. "Then this year [2010], I have seen 13
cases in my practice."

If left untreated, the disease can be deadly. At least half of the
dogs treated at Butera's practice have died because of the disease.

Butera said she spoke with a veterinarian from Holmes County who
mentioned the spike in [leptospirosis] cases. Outbreaks have been
documented in the Midwest, including Detroit and Kansas City.

In the past, leptospirosis has been most prevalent in outdoor and
sport dogs, but Butera said many of the cases she has seen are in
house dogs. While any animal or person can contract the disease,
Butera said cats appear to be resistant to it.

"It seems to be affecting little dogs, not just your outdoor and
sporting dogs," she said. "There are cases of dogs living in
apartments in New York City coming down with it."

Butera said animals that come in contact with urine of wildlife
including rats, groundhogs, and squirrels can become infected. Dogs
that spend a lot of time out in the yard, in ponds and creeks, and
even mud puddles are susceptible. "The bacteria need it (environment)
to be wet," she said. "Even dew on the grass (can harbor the
bacteria)."

Signs can vary and are hard to identify, Butera said, but include
vomiting, fever, fatigue, an increase in thirst, loss of appetite,
and a hunched back.

"It's treatable," she said. "The sooner we start treating them the better."

Depending on the strain, Butera said, the disease can cause liver
failure, blood clotting disorders, and kidney problems.

Butera said there is a vaccine available to combat leptospirosis.
While it only protects against 4 strains, she said it is useful.

The vaccine had been part of the normal vaccinations for dogs, but
because of high number of reactions to the vaccine vets stopped
giving the immunization. But Butera said the vaccine is safe and is
available.

Butera warns pet owners to take action if their animal is exhibiting
any of the signs associated with leptospirosis.

"It's hard to diagnose and the tests for it are not perfect and
expensive, but if it is not treated it can be fatal," she said.

A standard dose of penicillin and a 2nd antibiotic will treat the
disease, she said. It can take several months to fight the infection.

"Some dogs don't have any clinical signs and recover without anyone
even knowing they have had it," she said. "Others don't respond well
(to treatment) and it takes a prolonged period of time to treat."

[Leptospirosis is caused by various species of _Leptospira_, a
spirochete in the family Leptospiraceae, order Spirochaetales. The
classification of this organism is complex. Before 1989, all of the
pathogenic isolates belonged to the species _Leptospira interrogans_,
which contained more than 200 serovars in 23 serogroups. More
recently, the genus _Leptospira_ has been reclassified into 16 or
more species.

All mammals appear to be susceptible to at least one species of
_Leptospira_. Disease is rare in cats, and less common in sheep than
cattle
- serovars associated with disease in cattle include _hardjo_,
_pomona_, _grippotyphosa_, _canicola_, and _icterohaemorrhagiae_
- serovars associated with disease in sheep and goats include
_hardjo_, _pomona_, _grippotyphosa_, and _ballum_
- serovars associated with disease in pigs include _pomona_,
_grippotyphosa_, _bratislava_, _canicola_, _icterohaemorrhagiae_,
_tarassovi_, and _muenchen_
- serovars associated with disease in horses include _hardjo_,
_pomona_, _canicola_, _icterohaemorrhagiae_, and _sejroe_
- serovars associated with disease in dogs include _pomona_,
_grippotyphosa_, _canicola_, _icterohaemorrhagiae_, _pyrogenes_,
_paidjan_, _tarassovi_, _ballum_, and _bratislava_.

The primary reservoir hosts for most _Leptospira_ serovars are wild
mammals, particularly rodents. Reservoir hosts among domestic animals
include cattle, pigs, sheep, and dogs. The specific reservoir host(s)
vary with the serovar and the geographic region. Disease in reservoir
hosts is more likely to be asymptomatic, mild, or chronic. Reservoir
hosts include:
- rats: serogroups _icterohaemorrhagiae_ and _ballum_
- mice: serogroup _ballum_
- cattle: serovars _hardjo_, _grippotyphosa_, and _pomona_
- sheep: serovars _hardjo_ and _pomona_
- pigs: serovars _pomona_, _tarassovi_, and _bratislava_
- dogs: serovars _canicola_ and _bataviae_.

So clearly this is a diverse group of serovars affecting a variety of
animals, and humans. This is a zoonotic disease and in many states is
a reportable disease to the state animal health association or
veterinarian when it is diagnosed in a dog. The human-animal bond may
increase the likelihood of an exposure to a human being.

While knowing the serovars may help in some regions, it may not in
other regions. It may in some cases help determine the source: the
local pond, or an encounter with a pig.

Leptospirosis can be transmitted either directly between hosts or
indirectly in the environment. _Leptospira_ spp. can be ingested in
contaminated food or water, spread in aerosolized urine or water, or
transmitted by direct contact with the skin. The organisms usually
enter the body through mucous membranes or abraded skin. They may
also be able to penetrate intact skin that has been immersed for a
long time in water. _Leptospira_ spp. are excreted in the urine, and
can be found in aborted or stillborn fetuses, as well as in normal
fetuses or vaginal discharges after calving. They can be isolated
from the male reproductive organs. Human cases have also been
transmitted during sexual intercourse, by breast feeding, from rodent
bites, and after laboratory accidents. _Leptospira_ spp. do not
multiply outside the host. In the environment, they require high
humidity for survival and are killed by dehydration or temperatures
greater than 50 deg C (122 deg F). They can remain viable from a few
to many weeks or months in contaminated soil and for several weeks in
cattle slurry. They can remain viable in water for several months
under laboratory conditions, but do not survive as well in river
water under natural conditions.

The clinical signs and severity of disease are highly variable in
dogs. Some infections are asymptomatic or mild, while others are
severe or fatal. The initial signs are usually nonspecific and may
include fever, depression, anorexia, stiffness, myalgia, shivering,
and weakness. The mucus membranes are often injected. These symptoms
may be followed by signs of kidney disease including anuria,
hematuria, or increased frequency of urination, vomiting,
dehydration, and oral ulceration. Abortions, diarrhea, gray stools,
coughing, dyspnea, conjunctivitis, weight loss, and jaundice may also
be seen. Hemorrhagic syndromes occur in some dogs: the mucus
membranes may have widespread petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages
and, in later stages of the disease, there may be hemorrhagic
gastroenteritis and epistaxis. Some dogs die peracutely without
clinical signs. Chronic kidney disease can be a sequela. Chronic
infections may be asymptomatic, or associated with fever of unknown
origin and conjunctivitis.

_Leptospira_ may be found in the blood, milk, and cerebrospinal,
thoracic, or peritoneal fluids. During chronic infections, they are
sometimes found in the urine. The liver, lung, brain, and kidney are
collected at necropsy from acute cases, and the kidney and genital
tract are tested in chronic cases. Organisms can also be found in the
body fluids or tissues of aborted fetuses.

Antibiotics used to treat leptospirosis include the tetracyclines,
penicillin/ampicillin, dihydrostreptomycin, streptomycin, and the
fluoroquinolones. The efficacy of treatment may depend on the
serovar. Fluid therapy, blood transfusions, and other supportive care
may also be necessary.

Control of this organism may depend upon sanitation and disinfection
of the area. _Leptospira_ species can be inactivated by 1 percent
sodium hypochlorite, 70 percent ethanol, glutaraldehyde,
formaldehyde, detergents, and acid. This organism is sensitive to
moist heat (121 deg C/250 deg F for a minimum of 15 min) and is also
killed by pasteurization. Preventing contact with likely carriers of
the organism may be the best prevention. The vaccine is, as the
article pointed out, useful and helpful in controlling/preventing the
disease.
