A record spike in the number of people with legionnaires' disease has
prompted the Canterbury District Health Board to issue a warning about the
dangers associated with potting mix and compost.

Canterbury had a record 62 cases of legionnaires' disease last year [2010],
22 of which were in December alone -- the highest ever in a single month.
Medical officer of health Dr Alistair Humphrey says two thirds of the cases
were a type of legionella associated with gardening soils.

December's 22 cases compare with 8 in November 2010. 3 patients required
intensive care and one died. Altogether 4 people died of legionnaires'
[disease] in Canterbury last year [2010], and one person remains quite
unwell in intensive care.

[The news release above presumably refers to _Legionella longbeachae_ when
it says that two thirds of the cases of legionnaires' disease were caused
by a type of legionella associated with exposure to gardening soils. Cases
of legionellosis due to _L. longbeachae_ associated with potting soil have
been described in the USA (see ProMED-mail post Legionellosis, potting soil
- USA: May-Jun 2000 20000904.1503) and Japan (Koide M, Saito A, Okazaki M,
et al: Isolation of _Legionella longbeachae_ serogroup 1 from potting soils
in Japan. Clin Infect Dis 1999; 29(4): 943-4;
<http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/4/943.long>), as well as
Australia, New Zealand, and the UK (see below). Non-sterilized potting soil
apparently contains a mixture of bacteria and free-living amoebae and
elevated storage temperatures may foster the intra-amoebic growth of _L.
longbeachae_ in the potting soil (Ross IS, Mee BJ, Riley TV. _Legionella
longbeachae_ in Western Australian potting mix. Med J Aust 1997; 166(7): 387).

The following has been extracted from moderator ML's comments in
ProMED-mail post Legionellosis, fatal - UK: (Wales) 20100914.3321:

Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by a Gram negative bacillus
of the genus _Legionella_, most commonly _Legionella pneumophila_.
Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of the disease; more than
70 per cent of cases are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in
Australia and New Zealand. For Australia and New Zealand, _L. pneumophila_
serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7 per cent of cases of
community-acquired legionellosis, and _Legionella longbeachae_ has
accounted for 30.4 per cent of cases (Yu VL, et al: Distribution of
_Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with
sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: an international collaborative
survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8;
<http://legionellalaboratory.com/lp_distribution.pdf>).

Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis that is less severe
than legionnaires' disease. Pontiac fever takes its name from an outbreak
in 1968 in Pontiac, Michigan, USA. Risk factors for Legionnaires' disease
include age over 50 years, cigarette smoking, diabetes, chronic heart or
lung disease, and immunosuppression.

Legionnaires' disease, and presumably Pontiac fever, is acquired by
inhalation of an infectious dose of aerosolized legionella. Usually a
building's contaminated water system is incriminated as the source.
Legionella are found primarily in the hot water portion of plumbing systems
and in cooling towers. Water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F)
support the highest concentrations of the organism in water storage tanks
of plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the contaminated warm water can
occur in showers, spa pools, sprays in groceries, fountains, and cooling
towers.

In contrast, in Australia and New Zealand, legionnaires' disease has been
associated with gardening and exposure to potting mix, compost, and soil;
in these countries _L. longbeachae_ has been commonly found in potting mix,
compost, and soil, and cultured from the respiratory specimens of patients
with sporadic community-acquired pneumonia. Cases of community-acquired
pneumonia due to _L. longbeachae_ also have been reported sporadically in
Europe
(<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19497>).
Indeed, legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ in a gardener was
reported recently in Scotland
(<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11167176>). However, legionella urinary
antigen test, which is commonly used to diagnose legionnaires' disease, is
only valid for detection of _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 and therefore
other samples must be collected from a patient suspected to be infected
with _Legionella_ other than _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 (such as, sputum
or bronchoalveolar wash obtained during bronchoscopy) for detection of
_Legionella_ by culture using special media.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful tool
to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype in
patient specimens suggests transmission from a common source. Because
legionella may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any
cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir should be
demonstrated by means of genotyping methods (see
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/> and
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/>).

The Canterbury region of New Zealand is located on the South Island; its
main city is Christchurch. For a map of this region see
