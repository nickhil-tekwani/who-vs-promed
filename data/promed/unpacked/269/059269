Guinea
----
As of 18:00 on 16 Apr 2014, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Guinea has reported a cumulative total of 197 clinical cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), including 122 deaths. To date, 101 cases have been laboratory confirmed, including 56 deaths; 43 cases (33 deaths) meet the probable case definition for EVD, and 53 cases (33 deaths) are classified as suspected cases; 24 health care workers have been affected with 13 deaths. Clinical cases of EVD have been reported from Conakry (47 cases, including 16 deaths), Guekedou (117/80), Macenta (22/16), Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4) and Djingaraye (1/1).

Contact tracing activities continue in all affected areas including new contacts generated by an HCW who passed away 3 days ago. In Conakry, 60 community volunteers are assisting the MOH and response partners in following up the 221 contacts currently under medical observation; 7 contacts who developed symptoms have been placed in isolation as a precautionary measure. A total of 249 contacts are being followed in Guekedou, 54 in Macenta 17 in Kissidougou, 63 in Dabola and 2 in Dingaraye.

A total of 36 patients are currently in isolation: 23 in Conakry, 12 in Gueckedou and one in Macenta. Clinical teams from WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) are supporting national medical and nursing staff at the Donka Hospital [Conakry] to strengthen patient triage, case management and infection prevention and control (IPC). Training on the safe handling of patients with EVD and the deceased was conducted jointly by the IPC and Logistics teams at the Donka hospital for staff working at the morgue, and for drivers and staff transporting patients in stretchers. A training of trainers activity for the directors of all 20 health centres in Conakry is planned for 17 Apr 2014. IPC training is also scheduled at 2 community health centres tomorrow [17 Apr 2014].

Numbers of cases and contacts remain subject to change due to consolidation of cases, contact and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities and the continuing laboratory investigations.

Mali
----
The Ministry of Health (MOH) of Mali has today [16 Apr 2014] reported that the clinical samples on the 6 suspected cases have tested negative for ebolavirus.

The samples were tested at the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus and Viral Haemorrhagic Fever of the Institut Pasteur, Dakar, Senegal. The samples were also tested using real-time PCR at the newly established, mobile high security laboratory at the SEREFO Center for HIV and TB Training and Research, University of Bamako [Mali]. Malian laboratory experts from the SEREFO Center, the National Institute of Public Health (INRSP), the Centre National d'Appui a la lutte contre la Maladie [National Centre of Support to the fight against Disease] (CNAM), the National Blood Transfusion Centre (CNTS) and the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Science, Techniques and Technology, Bamako (FMOS) were trained in ebolavirus diagnosis by staff of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).

As of 16 Apr 2014, no new suspected cases have been reported in Mali.

Continuing preparedness and response activities include raising awareness among health care workers and the broader community about EVD and reinforcing personal and community-based risk reduction strategies. The need for strict adherence to infection prevention and control measures within health care facilities remains a key intervention.

WHO is supporting the national health authorities of Mali, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire in the planning of a cross-border meeting on Ebola virus disease. Response partners supporting the MOH include WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), MSF, the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), Agence Francaise de Developpement [French Development Agency] (AFD), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the NIH and the UN Children's Rights and Emergency Relief Organization (UNICEF).

Liberia
-------
As of 16 Apr 2014, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported a cumulative total of 27 clinical cases of EVD, including 13 deaths attributed to EVD. One new suspected case reported yesterday [15 Apr 2014] from Nimba County has been laboratory confirmed as a case of Lassa fever; 2 patients remain hospitalised, and 33 contacts remain under medical observation. The MOHSW commissioned a new ebolavirus laboratory today [16 Apr 2014] in collaboration with Metabiota.

The MOHSW, in collaboration with WHO and the GOARN team in Liberia, has conducted visits to the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Monrovia and the Redemption Hospital, New Kru Town in Montserrado County, and conducted the 1st training [course] in case management, triage and infection prevention and control.

Sierra Leone
---------
On 15 Apr 2014, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) provided a consolidated report of surveillance activities conducted in that country from 19 Mar 2014 onwards. A total of 12 suspected cases have been identified during that period; 2 previously reported suspected EVD deaths occurred in individuals from one family who died in Guinea and whose bodies were repatriated to Sierra Leone for burial. All of the 15 case contacts have completed 21 days of medical follow-up and have remained well.

The Metabiota laboratory team working at the Kenema Government Hospital Lassa Fever Isolation Unit have received and tested clinical samples from 11 of the suspected cases using 2 different real-time PCR protocols for Ebola Zaire, other viral haemorrhagic fevers and important locally endemic pathogens. All of the samples have tested negative for ebolavirus and the other pathogens included in the test panel.

Follow up on rumours of EVD cases and active case finding is ongoing in Sierra Leone. Metabiota in collaboration with the MOHS have conducted training of trainers at the Kenema Lassa Fever unit on EVD preparedness and response for 75 clinicians and nurses from the main referral government, private and mission hospitals in the 13 districts. Multimedia community sensitisation activities are also continuing.

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, Mali or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.

Some Key Points [check source for full list]
- One additional suspected case of Ebola was reported in Saclapea, Nimba County, raising the total number of suspected, probable and confirmed Ebola cases to 27, including 13 Ebola-related deaths, for a case fatality rate of 48 percent.
- The National Reference Lab tested its 1st Ebola sample yesterday [15 Apr 2014].
- UNICEF deployed 2 field coordinators and a 10-person team specialized in interpersonal communications to Lofa County, where they will work with communities to increase awareness of Ebola.
- With logistical support from Samaritan's Purse, UNICEF air-lifted urgently needed tarps, sprayers, chlorine and other supplies to Lofa County for use in completing the isolation unit at Foya Hospital. The agency will air-lift additional supplies later this week.
- UNICEF's estimated funding requirement for Ebola-related C4D, Health and WASH* interventions currently stands at approximately USD 500 000 for the period from 21 Mar to 21 Jun 2014. The estimated funding gap is USD 370 000.
*see below.

Situation Overview
- Since 14 Apr 2014, the total number of suspected, probable and confirmed cases of Ebola has risen to 27, while total Ebola-related deaths remains steady at 13.* The case fatality rate is 48 percent. The additional (suspected) case was identified in Saclapea, Nimba County.
- The total confirmed Ebola cases stands at 6.
- Lofa County remains the epicentre of the Ebola outbreak, particularly Foya District. Lofa is also the county with the highest numbers of reported suspected, probable and confirmed Ebola cases (10) and Ebola-related deaths (9). All 6 of the confirmed Ebola cases also originated in Lofa, though 2 of these patients travelled to Margibi County after contracting the virus.
- The National Reference Lab (NRL)** in Margibi County ran its 1st test on a sample collected in-country. The sample, which came from Margibi County, tested negative for Ebola. The NRL Ebola testing facility is expected to be commissioned today [16 Apr 2014] by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW). Its operations will significantly increase the speed at which Ebola samples can be tested, which will, in turn, improve data on suspected, probable and confirmed cases.

*This includes the 2 persons who were diagnosed in Liberia but died in Guinea early in the outbreak.
**It will be recalled that the Ebola testing facility at the NRL is being supported by an interagency team from the United States comprised of the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Defense (DoD).

UNICEF Response
Through its Communications and Child Survival Sections, UNICEF continues to provide critical communications for development (C4D); water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); and health sector support to the national Ebola response. This work is performed in coordination with the relevant national committees and working groups: namely the Social Mobilization Committee of the NTF, which was previously referred to as the Health Promotion Committee; the Case Management Committee of the NTF; and the WASH Working Group. Updates on specific UNICEF activities include the following:

Communications for Development (C4D):
As a member of the Social Mobilization Committee of the NTF, UNICEF assisted in finalizing the draft national communications strategy for the Ebola response. This national strategy will also guide UNICEF's work.

UNICEF deployed the 2 field coordinators and the 10-person team contracted from the interpersonal communications (IPC) firm to Lofa County. The coordinators were deployed yesterday (15 Apr 2014), while the IPC team left today.

The coordinators will be based in Foya, the epicentre of the outbreak, and Voinjama, the county capital. Together with the County Health Team (CHT) and partner organizations, they will continue the ongoing work with the general Community Health Volunteers (gCHVs) to raise awareness and increase understanding of Ebola at the community-level. They will also enhance support to local community radio stations in Lofa County to ensure that
(1) Ebola messages are being regularly broadcast, and
(2) the stations have the support needed (e.g., fuel for generators) to stay on air for as long as possible.
The coordinators will work closely with the Lofa CHT and will be expected to send daily reports to the UNICEF Monrovia office.

The 10-person IPC team will be divided between the following district capitals: Foya (4), Voinjama (2), Kolahun (2), and Zorzor (2). They will focus on these major towns, as well as nearby urban and peri-urban areas.

Both the coordinators and the IPC team will target schools, churches, mosques and marketplaces, and will liaise with traditional leaders, healers and other pivotal community members. The idea is to empower individual Liberians with the knowledge, resources and health facility contacts to keep Ebola from ravaging their communities.

UNICEF finalized the 2 school and community-friendly posters on Ebola, as well as a flip chart for use by the IPC team in their outreach in Lofa County.

All UNICEF-supported mass media activities are ongoing, including work with local community radio stations and key national stations.

Child survival (wash and health):
On 16 Apr 2014, with the logistical support of Samaritan's Purse, UNICEF air-lifted a new batch of urgently needed supplies of chlorine, plastic tarpaulins, sprayers and other materials to Lofa, where MSF is providing support for emergency health services at the isolation unit in Foya Hospital. The delivery came a day after MSF requested this support at the NTF meeting on 15 Apr 2014.

By the end of the week, UNICEF will deliver additional supplies requested by MSF for the isolation unit in Foya, including mattresses and blankets.

National Task Force Updates
Budget and donor support:

The MoHSW's 3-month Ebola response budget still stands at USD 2.5 million. It covers all 15 counties in Liberia but prioritizes Lofa, Bong, Nimba, Margibi, Montserrado and Grand Cape Mount. The MoHSW also intends to scale up efforts in Gbarpolu, if/when possible. The Ministry of Finance has appropriated USD 250 000 for the budget.

The NTF committed to present a mapping of partners' support provided to date at the next NTF meeting on Fri 18 Apr 2014.

Laboratory and epidemiology:
The establishment of the Ebola testing facility at the NRL has already helped screen alleged cases of Ebola. As mentioned in the overview, one sample from Margibi was tested at the center, and the results were negative, ruling out the virus.

[3] Sierra Leone
Date: 16 Apr 2014

http://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/archives/66755


The Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry (DMTI) Alie Mansaray has said due to the threatening nature of Ebola, especially in the neighboring countries of Guinea and Liberia, the government has banned the bringing of dead bodies to be buried in Sierra Leone, especially from Guinea and Liberia.

This disclosure was made in the conference room of the Ministry of Trade and Industry as both the Ministry of Health and Sanitation and Trade Ministry officials engaged petty [small] traders on Ebola issues on Wed 9 Apr 2014.

The Deputy Trade Minister further said that it is no secret that a strange disease (Ebola), though not yet in Sierra Leone, is terrorizing our neighboring sister countries of Guinea and Liberia, which, he said, is very threatening to us as a government and the country as a whole.

Their stake in the issue is because the Trade Ministry is directly in contact with petty traders who go on a daily basis to Guinea and Liberia on business purposes, and, therefore, they held the meeting as an awareness raising campaign, especially for traders who used to go to these countries.

The deputy minister emphasized that Ebola has no cure but can be prevented. He cataloged the signs and symptoms as heavy fever, vomiting, diarrhea, throat ache, weakness, rash in various part of the body except the face, and the oozing of blood from various openings like ears, nose and mouth.

The Technical Expert in the Ministry of Health and Sanitation, Mr. Harold Thomas, expounded on the International Health Regulations (IHR). He confirmed that MOHS has Public Health Specialists all over the country to monitor the issue. He cautioned that Ebola is a severe infectious disease which is spread through fruit bats, and, therefore, people should stop eating bats, "Bat Mot" fruits, monkeys, chimpanzees, and all wild animals. He further said that people should stop eating animals found dead.

"People should go to health facilities immediately when they experience sudden fever, diarrhea or vomiting; this illness can also be contracted through body fluid contact like blood and urine," said Thomas.

Mr. Lansana Conteh of MOHS emphatically cautioned Sierra Leoneans to start practicing the frequent washing of hands with soap and water, to also minimize hand shake [This is perfectly safe if the person is not sick. - Mod.JW], minimize the touching of sick people and the washing of dead bodies especially without hand gloves, also avoiding the eating of bush meats, bats, and fruits partly eaten by birds.

He further said that in case of any suspected death, the people in the compound of the deceased will be isolated for 21 days for medical checks before allowing them to rejoin the general populace [This is a good way to discourage people from reporting a death. - Mod.JW].

Present at the meeting were the Chief Director and Professional Head of Trade and Industry Mr. Ahmed Akar Ahmed and the Director of Commerce and Industry Mr. Charles M. Thompson.

[4] Guinea, doctor deaths
Date: 16 Apr 2014
Source: Guinean News [in French, machine trans. & Mod.JW, edited]
http://guineenews.org/2014/04/fievre-hemorragique-en-guinee-9-nouveaux-cas-a-donka-et-deces-dun-autre-medecin


Exactly one week ago, on Wed 9 Apr 2014, the Guinean government gave more statistics on the evolution of Ebola viral hemorrhagic fever. However, families and physicians continue to mourn the victims swept away by this serious disease without a vaccine or cure.

According to our information, there were 9 new suspected cases of Ebola detected only yesterday ["There are 11 new cases of Ebola in Guekedou including 3 dead," says prefect [mayor] Mohamed Keita in post (19) listed at the bottom of this post. - Mod.JW].

One of National Donka Hospital's emergency physicians, Dr. Sidiki Kaba, died Sun 13 Apr 2014 after having been in contact with a patient, without knowing that [the patient] was contaminated. Dr. Siaka Camara, a neurologist at Kipe also lost his life yesterday [15 Apr 2014] after being in contact with a patient.

Apart from these known cases, it is reported that more than 20 physicians are currently isolated in National Donka Hospital who have been in contact with cases that ultimately proved to be ebolavirus cases. And several other [doctors] are "fugitives," refusing to be isolated, since they had had risky contacts.

According to confidential sources, the government changed tactics, particularly in its communications in the face of the deadly fever. From now on, only statistics of people "cured" will be divulged and not the new suspected cases or deaths, even though those are not lacking. ... But, in the opinion of some doctors, refusal to inform citizens increases risky behavior and further exposes citizens [to infection], most of whom have never believed in the real existence of the Ebola virus.

Today [16 Apr 2014], in the absence of sincere, serious and convincing communication, rumors have completely taken over.

[The number of doctors in isolation and, therefore, unable to care for patients is staggering. It is commendable that so many health workers (HW) have stuck to their posts in view of their high death rates. During the plague scare in Surat, India in 1994, thousands of people, including most doctors and other HWs fled the city; see ProMED archived post "Plague - India (MMWR) 19941025.0062."

Past experience has shown that withholding information on the progress of an epidemic is counter-productive and only makes the panic worse. - Mod.JW
