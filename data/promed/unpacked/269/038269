A dead cat infected with botulism toxin, according to this story, apparently
caused the death of 418 cows on a dairy near Modesto last weekend.
The cat carcass was found in one of the feeding bins at the Genasci Brothers
Dairy on Blue Gum Road west of Modesto. Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the
California Department of Food and Agriculture was cited as saying the
carcass may have been picked up in a hay bale and mixed into the feed.
The cat carcass tested positive for botulism.
Ron Terra, a veterinarian with Lander Veterinary Clinic in Turlock was
quoted as saying, "The chances of it happening are almost infinitesimal out
in the open like this on a dairy. It's the first case I've seen in 15 years
of practice."
The ranch is being sanitized to make sure the botulism toxin isn't present
before new cows are introduced to the pens.

[This report does not make sense. If 418 cows had died as a result of
consuming parts of this cat dead from botulism, there would not have been
enough bits of it around to describe it as a "carcass". This is bad
reporting. It also lacks diagnoses on any of the dead cattle. Do any of our
Californian members know the reality of this incident? - Mod.MHJ]
