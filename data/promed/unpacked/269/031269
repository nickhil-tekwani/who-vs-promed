New cassava disease in Nigeria threatens yields and expected revenues
------------------------------
Nigeria's production of cassava for its population and for export over the
next 5 years is now at risk because of severe cassava mosaic disease (CMD).
CMD has been ravaging Nigeria and other cassava-producing countries of
sub-Saharan Africa, but a recent survey by the International Institute of
Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, has identified symptoms of a new and
virulent type of CMD. The survey report indicated that a new cassava virus,
East African cassava mosaic begomovirus (EACMV-Ug), which originated in
Uganda, is a recombinant between African cassava mosaic begomovirus (ACMV)
and East African cassava mosaic begomovirus (EACMV).
The new virus is spreading westward from north central Uganda toward
Nigeria and has already infected cassava in Niger State in Nigeria and
neighboring Cameroon. The report also states that the new virus could cause
serious food shortages if not checked.
CMD is regarded as the greatest constraint on cassava production in
sub-Saharan Africa and the most important vector-borne disease of any
African food crop. It is caused by a group of viruses that spread via
whiteflies (_Bemisia tabaci_) or by planting of CMD infected cassava stems.
ACMV is common in West Africa and EACMV is prevalent in East Africa. Little
attention was paid to the latter, although yield loss is about 15 to 25 per
cent. The Ugandan variant is much more damaging, especially when cassava
plants are doubly infected with the variant and ACMV.
According to Paul Ilona, a plant breeder and research associate at IITA,
the institute has launched a pre-emptive program of disease management
through accelerated multiplication and distribution of diverse CMD
resistant cassava varieties. Earlier IITA-developed cultivars were
resistant to ACMV, but not to EACMV-Ug, because they did not have
diversified sources of virus resistance. IITA will assist farmers in
evaluating those genotypes in various cropping areas, and it is expected
that they will be adopted by farmers.
Cassava has tremendous potential to contribute to food security, rural
income, and the national economy. Because of its year-round availability,
tolerance to extreme ecological stress and impoverished soils, and its
suitability to existing farming systems, it is playing a major role in the
effort to alleviate food crises and rural poverty.

[Nigeria is the world leader in cassava production, and the presence of the
EACMV-Ug in Nigeria and Cameroon presents a serious threat to food security
in both countries. Molecular studies show that EACMV-Ug is a recombinant
virus containing a large part of the ACMV coat protein gene, which has been
inserted into the DNA-A component of an EACMV-like sequence. The presence
of EACMV-Ug in Niger State and Cameroon calls for concerted action to
deliver appropriate information for farmers and provision of resistant
cultivars as soon as possible. - Mod.DH]
