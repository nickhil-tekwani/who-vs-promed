Guatemalan Health Vice Minister Carlos Andrade is reported to have
confirmed that more than 120 participants in a carnival earlier this month
have been hospitalized with typhoid fever. The patients were seen at local
hospitals near Puerto Barrios, about 150 miles north of Guatemala City. A
contaminated water supply is the suspected source. There have been no
reported deaths, and the outbreak is under control.
