The Ohio Department of Agriculture confirmed on 13 Sep 2017 the 1st positive cases of West Nile virus (WNV) in Ohio horses for 2017.

Multiple cases in different parts of the state have been reported. The horses confirmed to have contracted WNV had not been vaccinated.

The spread of WNV in horses is preventable with proper vaccination and horse owners are urged to ensure their animals' vaccine and boosters are up to date.

West Nile Virus is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed.

Changes in mentality, drowsiness, driving or pushing forward (often without control), and asymmetrical weakness may be observed. Mortality rate from WNV can be as high as 30-40 percent in horses.

Infection with WNV does not always lead to signs of illness in people or animals.

WNV is endemic in the United States and Ohio has reported positive cases in horses each of the last few years.

The WNV cases follow the Ohio Department of Agriculture's report of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in an Ashtabula County horse 24 Aug 2017.

Both illnesses have presented in animals that were not vaccinated against the disease and lived near areas that are typically prone to harboring mosquitoes.

State Veterinarian Dr Tony Forshey said these cases should serve as a reminder to get animals vaccinated and that vaccines are a proven prevention tool against viruses like WNV and EEE.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also should work to reduce the mosquito population and eliminate possible breeding areas.

Recommendations include: removing stagnant water sources; keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening; and using mosquito repellents.

[Both of these diseases, WNV and EEE, are preventable with a combined vaccination, with 2 injections usually given 3-4 weeks apart.

Mosquito control in pastures and around the barn and home is critical. Look for any source of standing water and eliminate it. Standing water, perfect for mosquito larvae, may be as small as the water in the catch pan of a potted plant, or a gutter not draining properly. Seek these water sources out and eliminate them. It will help with mosquito control.

Horse specific repellents are also available.

So remember to vaccinate your horse(s), eliminate mosquito habitats, and spray your animals with appropriate mosquito and fly repellent. - Mod.TG
