Latakia Health Directorate warned of the danger of eating wild fungus after it was harvested randomly from the fields. This is due to the influx of several cases suffering from severe digestive symptoms to the district's hospitals during the past few days.

Dr. Loay Saeed, poisoning official at the Health Directorate, stated in a statement to a SANA reporter that the number of poisoning cases treated at the directorate's hospitals amounted to 13 cases, in addition to a family that was treated at Jableh National Hospital, indicating all cases have now recovered.

Dr. Saeed pointed out the symptoms of medical poisoning are usually accompanied by abdominal pain, frequent vomiting, diarrhea, excessive salivation, respiratory disorders, and blood in the urine. Some mushrooms may cause neurological symptoms such as hallucinations, depending on the toxic substance they contain.

He also said that there are many toxic fungi whose poisoning symptoms appear early (from an hour to 24 hours), and [the course of the illness] tends to be healthy [?] in terms of development and recovery; in some others, symptoms may be delayed for more than 24 hours, and [patients] end up after several days with acute liver or kidney failure (depending on the type of toxic toxin these fungi carry), resulting in multiple organ failure, which may lead to death in some cases.

Dr. Saeed pointed out the process of distinguishing between toxic and non-toxic fungi is difficult in terms of shape, color, or place of growth, and practical experience and laboratory tests for fungi remain decisive in determining this, as toxic and non-toxic fungi are similar in smell and taste. "Some [of] the fungus is toxic while it is fresh, and its toxicity is removed by cooking, and vice versa: the fungus may become toxic after cooking," he said.

He explained it is necessary to see a doctor or hospital when the 1st suspicious symptoms appear and to inform the doctor of all information related to the mushroom that was eaten (color, place, duration of consumption, people who took part in eating the mushroom to conduct tests to ensure that they are not infected), stressing that detection [and] starting treatment early reduces the number of complications and injuries that may occur after poisoning.

[Limited clinical signs are noted in the report, so it is difficult to speculate on the type of mushroom ingested. Wild mushroom harvesting is a part of many cultures, but it can be difficult to distinguish between toxic and non-toxic varieties.

Toxic mushrooms exist in every country. Mushroom identification can be challenging, requiring a trained mycologist to distinguish the sometimes very minor differences between toxic and nontoxic fungi.

Ingestion of toxic mushrooms may cause mild to severe illness/vomiting and result in recovery with treatment, and it may even result in death, with or without treatment. Please be careful to correctly identify the mushroom, as these fungi can be deadly. - Mod.TG
