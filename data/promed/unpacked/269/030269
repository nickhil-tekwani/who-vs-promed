At least 21 people have died in Myanmar due to swine flu [influenza A(H1N1)] in the past 2 weeks, according to a health ministry official on Tue [2 Jul 2019]. "Over the past few weeks, 21 including 4 children have died of seasonal H1N1 influenza," said Phyu Phyu Aye, information officer of health and sports ministry.

The 1st death related to the H1N1 virus, widely known as swine flu, was reported on [19 Jun 2019]. A total of 99 out of more than 340 patients were tested positive for the virus in 3 regions -- Yangon, Sagaing, and Ayeyawaddy, Aye told Anadolu Agency over the phone. "Yangon is the worst affected area," she said, adding that 18 victims were from the largest city in the South Asian nation.

Authorities issued a health alert in the country asking people with the seasonal fever to stay away from public gatherings, and local hospitals to be prompt in their diagnosis.

[In the current situation surveillance activities need to be increased, including involvement of private clinics and health facilities to refer suspected specimens for testing in the national/public laboratories (http://burmese.dvb.no/archives/335161 Myanmar), so more cases can be identified. However, early detection and proper treatment would be crucial to reduce number of fatal cases. - Mod.UBA

[2] South Africa: increase, H3N2
Date: Sun 14 Jul 2019

There has been a noticeable increase in cases of flu and pneumonia in South Africa compared to last year [2018], along with the time it takes for affected individuals to recover.

The Centre for Respiratory Diseases and Meningitis (CRDM) has announced its concerns regarding the rise in cases in a report, saying, "The 2019 South African influenza season, which started towards the end of April, is ongoing. Transmission of influenza measured using the Viral Watch programme and impact measured using the pneumonia surveillance programme have both reached high levels." As more people struggle to kick the nasty bug so do more find themselves contracting the flu from friends, family members, or colleagues. The CRDM has declared that the risk of contracting these respiratory illnesses will extend until October this year [2019].

Influenza A(H3N2) has been identified as the most prevalent strain this year. According to the CRDM, "To date, the majority 711/783 (91%) of influenza positive samples for this season, detected by 3 surveillance programmes, have been identified as influenza A(H3N2). Influenza A(H3N2) is one of the three seasonal influenza viruses prevalent in human populations."

Along with being longer than is the norm, the 2019 flu season also started earlier in the year. The 1st week of June is usually when it begins, but this year reports of cases of flu began being recorded in April.

CRDM warned that some groups may be especially vulnerable to this spike in flu cases, particularly pregnant people, the elderly and those already suffering with a disease that weakens their immune system. Locals are encouraged to be cautious and even take immunity-boosting supplements for prevention. Additionally, individuals who contract the flu should take at least 2 days off work to reduce the spread of the virus and shorten their recovery time.

[3] Western Australia: increase

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-17/four-more-dead-in-one-of-was-worst-flu-seasons-in-a-decade/11314670


More than 50 people have died from influenza-related illness in Western Australia this season [2019]; the number of new cases has slowed, but authorities do not know if the worst is over; and there has been a big increase in the number of WA parents vaccinating young children. Influenza has claimed 4 more lives in the past week in what is shaping up as Western Australia's most deadly flu season in a decade.

However experts say cases appear to be on the decline, suggesting the worst may be over from a virus that is notoriously difficult to combat through vaccination. This time last year [2018] there had been 2009 confirmed cases and just 5 deaths.

So far this year [2019] WA deaths from influenza-related illnesses have increased 940 per cent to 52, and confirmed cases of the flu have jumped 860 per cent to 19 327. But the Health Department has warned against directly comparing the number of confirmed cases this year with previous years, noting that this year's season began about 2 months earlier than normal. It was too soon to know if the flu season would end early, and therefore ultimately be on par with previous seasons in terms of overall severity.

UWA [University of Western Australia] clinical professor David Smith, a director of the National Influenza Centre, said 2018 had been "a very quiet" flu season, with 21 deaths in WA. "And that possibly means that the population as a whole hasn't been primed well to be ready for the influenza activity this year [2019].

Lauren Bloomfield from Edith Cowan University's School of Medical and Health Sciences said while the number of cases this year was high, there had been a downward trend over the past few weeks. "It's certainly slowing down," she said. "And hopefully it will come to an end soon."

The department's message about the importance of vaccinating against the flu appeared to be getting through to parents, with 46% of children aged 6 months to 5 years recorded on the Australian Immunisation Register, compared to just 16% at the same time last year [2018]. But Dr Bloomfield said getting a shot would not necessarily prevent someone from coming down with the flu, and urged people to adjust their expectations of the seasonal vaccine. "Many people would be used to getting a vaccine once in their life, and going on to have protection that lasts years or perhaps a whole lifetime," she said. "But influenza changes so quickly and so often that we need a new vaccine for it every year."

Each year the World Health Organisation gathers data and uses it to predict what strains of flu are most likely to be circulating in either the northern or southern hemispheres in the coming season. From those predictions they design a vaccine they think wil be a good match. But Dr Bloomfield said it is never foolproof. "There is no guarantee that the vaccines are going to be a very good match for the flu strains that are circulating, and we have seen some years when there has been quite a bad mismatch," she said.

Dr Bloomfield said the Health Department constantly measured what was known as "vaccine effectiveness". "But unfortunately, we do need quite a few people to get the flu in order to be able to test how effective the vaccine was," she said. "It can vary between the strains and it can vary from year to year." She said while interim testing suggested this year's [3019] vaccine was a good match for the strains of influenza spreading across WA, the department would not know for sure until around September. "We're going to have to wait unfortunately until the season is a bit further along to find out how well we go the vaccine matched this year," she said.

[4] Vaccine effectiveness
Date: Thu 27 Jun 2019

https://www.statnews.com/2019/06/27/flu-vaccine-effectiveness-bug/


The flu vaccine turned out to be a big disappointment again. The vaccine didn't work against a flu bug that popped up halfway through the past flu season, dragging down overall effectiveness to 29%, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Thu 27 Jun 2019.

The flu shot was working well early in the season with effectiveness put at 47% in February. But it was virtually worthless during a 2nd wave driven by a tougher strain, at just 9%. There was "no significant protection" against that strain, said CDC's Brendan Flannery.

Flu vaccines are made each year to protect against 3 or 4 different kinds of flu virus. The ingredients are based on predictions of what strains will make people sick the following winter. This season's [2018-19] shot turned out to be a mismatch against the bug that showed up late. That pushed down the overall effectiveness to one of the lowest in recent years. Since 2011, the only season with a lower estimate was the winter of 2014-2015, when effectiveness was 19%. A mismatch was also blamed then.

Vaccines against some other infectious diseases are not considered successful unless they are at least 90% effective. But flu is particularly challenging, partly because the virus can so quickly change. Overall, flu vaccine has averaged around 40%.

Summary

In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza detections continued to increase or remained elevated in most areas.
The 2019 influenza season has started earlier than previous years in Australia, Chile, South Africa and New Zealand.
- Influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated in Oceania and South Africa.
- Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated in temperate South America.
In Southern Asia and South East Asia, influenza activity was low across reporting countries, except Myanmar where an increase in influenza A(H1N1) was reported.
In the Caribbean, Central American countries, and the tropical countries of South America, influenza and RSV activity were low in general, with exception of Costa Rica and Panama where influenza A viruses activity was high
In Northern, Eastern, West and Middle Africa, influenza activity was low across reporting countries.
In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere influenza activity returned to inter-seasonal level in most countries.
Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 91 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 10 June 2019 to 23 June 2019 (data as of 2019-07-04 13:50:17 UTC).The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 68851 specimens during that time period. 6853 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 4387 (64%) were typed as influenza A and 2466 (36%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 972 (36.1%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1717 (63.9%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 48 (4%) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 1144 (96%) to the B-Victoria lineage.
