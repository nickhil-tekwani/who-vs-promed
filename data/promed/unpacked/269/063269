An outbreak of brucellosis amongst populations of livestock all over [TRNC (self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus)] is now rapidly developing, because there is no money in the "budget" for fighting against it, reports Turkish Cypriot media.

Brucellosis is a highly contagious zoonosis caused by ingestion of unsterilized milk or meat from infected animals or close contact with their secretions.

Transmission from human to human is rare but possible.

The chairman of the union of livestock producers, Mustafa Naimoglulari, confirmed that the brucellosis microbe has been discovered at 60 farms and criticized the authorities for not launching a fight against the disease.

He said that blood should have been taken from the animals for analysis in order to establish which of them are contaminated.

In statements to Kibris, the official responsible for agriculture in TRNC, Onder Sennaroglu said that they have taken money from UNOPS to deal with the issue, but they could not eliminate brucellosis.

He noted that he knows that money should not be an excuse, but the cost of this issue is very high. "I have to say that resources are needed, and we have no resources at the moment," he admitted, adding that they have applied to the EU for money.

In most countries, any animal found to be infected with brucellosis is immediately killed and properly disposed of.

[It may be assumed that the above described suspected epizootic refers to _Brucella melitensis_ in small ruminants (sheep and goats), but official information is lacking. _B. melitensis_ may infect cattle as well.

According to OIE's data, Cyprus had its last case of _B. abortus_ in 1932.

_B. melitensis_ was endemic in Cyprus before the 1970s. After a successful 15-year eradication campaign, the island was declared free from Brucellosis. However, in 1997 the disease reappeared and a new brucellosis campaign was reintroduced in the Republic of Cyprus with the purpose of eliminating the disease. The last positive case there was recorded, according to OIE data, in 2010. On 30 Apr 2013, after 13 years of program implementation, Cyprus requested from the European Commission (EC) the Brucellosis (_B. melitensis_) Officially Free Member State Status (see at http://tinyurl.com/oohyeby).

Confirmation and additional information on the reported spread of _B. melitensis_ in the northern part of the island is requested; the source might be Turkey, where the disease is endemic. In case confirmed, the risk of _B. melitensis_ re-introduction into the southern part of the island, namely to EC-member Republic of Cyprus, is a cause for grave concern. - Mod.AS
