Blood products precautions announced for the UK.
Precautions to protect patients against the theoretical risk of contracting
new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD) from blood products have been
announced in the United Kingdom. The announcement followed a recall of blood
products in November 1997, when some contributing donors were confirmed as
having developed nvCJD, and a review of the current evidence by the UK
Committee of Safety of Medicines (CSM).
The National Blood Service will be allowed to import plasma to manufacture
blood products. Recombinant factor VIII - the synthetic version of factor
VIII used in the treatment of haemophilia - is to be made available to
children under the age of 16 years and to new patients. The CSM has also
advised that recalls should include blood products if donors have
subsequently been identified as being strongly suspected of having nvCJD.
The previous recall was confined to products to which confirmed cases of
nvCJD had contributed. All products manufactured from British donor plasma
will be reviewed to determine which should be made from plasma sourced from
other countries which do not have clusters of cases of nvCJD.
Mr Frank Dobson, the Secretary of State for Health, said that these
recommendations do not mean that UK blood and blood products are unsafe.
There is no evidence to show that nvCJD can be transmitted through blood
products or blood - the risk remains only theoretical. By the end of January
1998, 23 definite cases of nvCJD had been identified in the UK.
