Two high school students have been diagnosed with perrtussis, also known as whooping cough, the Plano Health Department confirmed Mon 9 Nov 2015.

According to the health department, both students go to Clark High School. School officials send a message to parents about one case last Fri 6 Nov 2015. The 2nd case was confirmed Mon 9 Nov 2015. Officials did not say what grade the infected students were in or release any other identifying information.

North Texas had a major pertussis outbreak in 2013. The CDC predicts the protection provided from the pertussis vaccine may last a decade or less. Those in whom the vaccine is no longer effective can become infected and transmit the disease to others through respiratory droplets.

Pertussis, in its early stages, mimics the common cold. It is often not suspected or diagnosed until the more-severe symptoms appear. Symptoms can include fits of rapid, high-pitched coughs, vomiting, and exhaustion. Antimicrobials can shorten the amount of time a patient is contagious. In most cases, children under 1 year old are most severely affected. Infants can receive the 1st vaccination at 2 months of age, though it takes several doses to attain protection.

The New Mexico Department of Health announced today [2 Nov 2015] an increase in whooping cough (pertussis) cases in Curry County. 13 cases have been confirmed in Curry County residents in 2015, including 7 school-aged children and 2 infants who were hospitalized. The current rate of pertussis in Curry County is 25.5 cases per 100 000 compared to 7.6 per 100 000 for 2010 through 2014.

Statewide, 149 probable and confirmed whooping cough cases have been reported in 2015, which is approximately half the number of cases reported at the same time in 2014.

"Whooping cough is very contagious and can cause serious cough illness, especially in infants too young to be fully vaccinated," said Department of Health Secretary Retta Ward, MPH. "Getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent whooping cough. When you get your flu shot, talk to your doctor or pharmacist to make sure you are up to date on your Tdap vaccination."

An outbreak of pertussis is ongoing among the Orthodox Jewish communities in Crown Heights, Williamsburg, and Borough Park, Brooklyn. From October 2014 through October 2015, 109 cases of pertussis have been reported to the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), with an increase in cases over the past 4 months. The majority of cases (90 percent) are children aged less than 19 years (median age 4 years), of whom 52 percent were unvaccinated or not up to date with pertussis-containing vaccine. Infants aged less than 1 year account for 34 percent (n=37) of cases. Of the 37 mothers of infants with pertussis, only 3 (8 percent) received the recommended tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccination during their most recent pregnancy. Five infants were hospitalized, including 1 who had pneumonia.

To control the outbreak, we urge you to:
1. Recall patients who are not up to date with DTaP and Tdap vaccines
2. Vaccinate pregnant women with Tdap during every pregnancy
3. Report suspect cases
4. Follow droplet precautions
5. Obtain optimal specimens for diagnostic testing
6. Provide prompt antimicrobial treatment and/or post-exposure prophylaxis

Delays in on-time initiation and completion of the pertussis-containing vaccine series remain problematic in the affected communities, facilitating ongoing transmission. Young infants are at greatest risk of severe pertussis infection and its complications. Recommended strategies to protect these infants include ensuring that the mother receives Tdap during her pregnancy and that the infant starts the vaccine series on time at 2 months of age. Subsequent doses should be given 4, 6 and 15-18 months and at 4-6 years of age. Pertussis-containing vaccines are required for children to attend child care, head start, pre-kindergarten and both private and public school programs. Providers caring for patients in the Orthodox Jewish communities should recall patients aged 2 months and older and who have not received recommended pertussis containing vaccines for immediate vaccination.

Pertussis is a highly contagious bacterial infection that begins with nonspecific upper respiratory symptoms that last for 7-10 days, followed by onset of cough. The classic pertussis cough includes persistent paroxysms (coughing fits), an inspiratory "whoop," apnea, and/or post-tussive vomiting. Cough may last weeks to months if not treated early.

People with prior history of disease or vaccination may have milder symptoms and lack classic features of disease, making diagnosis more difficult. Maintain a high level of suspicion of pertussis in all patients with a persistent cough. In infants, apnea can be a prominent feature and complications of pertussis include pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. In adults, complications of pertussis include post-tussive syncope and rib fracture, in addition to persistent cough.

Individuals are infectious for up to 3 weeks or until 5 days after the start of effective antimicrobial treatment. If pertussis is suspected based on clinical presentation or known exposure to a pertussis case, clinicians should collect a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and send it to a commercial laboratory for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Provide treatment after collecting diagnostic specimens. Do not wait for the results. Waiting for results facilitates disease transmission. Specimens are most likely to be positive when patients have a clinically compatible illness and specimens are collected within the first 3 weeks of cough onset and before completion of antimicrobials.

DOHMH does not recommend serologic testing for pertussis because standardized tests are not available, making the results of commercially available tests difficult to interpret. More information about pertussis diagnostics can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/clinical/downloads/diagnosis-pcr-bestpractices.pdf.

Antimicrobial treatment can alleviate symptoms and reduce pertussis transmission if given early in the course of illness. Treatment should be provided to persons aged 1 year or older within 3 weeks of cough onset and to infants less than 1 year of age and pregnant women within 6 weeks of cough onset. Children receiving treatment must stay home and cannot attend child care or school until they have received 5 days of antimicrobials; similarly, adults should also stay home for the same time period. Treatment beyond this period is not thought to alter the duration of cough nor transmission to others and is not recommended. Physicians should prescribe either a macrolide or, for macrolide allergic patients, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Antimicrobials should also be provided to close contacts (e.g. household members) of confirmed pertussis cases as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent illness and transmission. The antibacterial and dosing for treatment and prophylaxis are the same. If pertussis is strongly suspected, then PEP should begin while awaiting laboratory confirmation. For details, see Table 4 at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5414.pdf.

In healthcare facilities, a dose of Tdap is routinely recommended for all healthcare personnel (HCP). HCPs should observe droplet precautions, such as wearing surgical masks, while evaluating suspect pertussis cases. Precautions should be observed regardless of the vaccination status of HCP. HCP with known unprotected exposure to pertussis and who are likely to expose pregnant women or neonates should receive PEP. Other HCP should either receive PEP or be monitored daily for 21 days after pertussis exposure and treated if pertussis symptoms develop. Clinicians should report all suspected cases of pertussis to DOHMH. Do not wait until laboratory confirmation to report. Early reporting allows DOHMH to investigate cases and assist the facility in identifying those who need post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent further infections. To report a suspected case, clinicians should call DOHMH at 866-692-3641.
