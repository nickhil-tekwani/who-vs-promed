A 9th Miami Valley Hospital patient has tested positive for
legionnaires' disease, and one more possible case is pending test
results, a hospital spokesman said on Tuesday afternoon [8 Mar 2011].

One patient with legionnaires' disease remains hospitalized for
unrelated health reasons, said Tim Cloonan, the hospital's director of
marketing and communications.

A Montgomery County public health official has said one patient -- a
Dayton man in his 70s -- died on 22 Feb 2011, but the hospital said
legionella bacteria did not cause that death. The public health
official had previously said the death occurred on 21 Feb 2011. It's
not clear if the pneumonia-like condition may have been a contributing
factor in the death of the man, whose name was not disclosed.

The hospital has not yet received confirmation that legionella
bacteria had been present in the water system of its new hospital
addition, called the "patient tower". Those results are expected this
Saturday [12 Mar 2011]. The hospital instituted water restrictions in
the patient tower for 3 days last month [February 2011] and
disinfected the water system as a precaution.
