The 2 health workers who were suspected to have contracted Marburg [virus] after treating a confirmed case of Marburg in Kapchorwa hospital have tested negative for the viral infection.

According to a press release from the Office of the Director General Health Services in the Ministry of health, blood specimens were obtained from 2 health workers and taken for laboratory testing at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI).

"Additional tests also indicated that the cases were negative for Ebola, Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), Rift Valley Fever and Sosuga viruses," read the press release.

However, there is currently one case on isolation at Kaproron HC IV in Kween district. The case, a 39-year-old male from Korosi village, Kamwam parish in Kaproron Sub County presented with vomiting, nausea, intense fatigue, headache and abdominal pain for 5 days. He had no known contact history with any of the cases previously identified.

"A blood sample was taken off for MVD testing. He was started on anti malarials and intravenous fluids," reads the press release.

The total number of contacts under follow up currently stands at 105 from both Kapchorwa and Kween districts.

These are the individuals who got into contact with either the probable or confirmed case and will be monitored until the recommended 21 days elapse.

Earlier, the health minister Ruth Aceng said there is no drug to cure the virus and advised the public to report suspected cases.

She advised the public to avoid contact with patients suffering from Marburg, since the virus can be contracted through body fluids. Suspected cases can be reported to the Ministry of Health hotline on 0800-100-066.

Symptoms may include: nausea and vomiting, diarrhea (may be bloody), red eyes, raised rash, chest pain and cough, sore throat, stomach pain and severe weight loss.

[It is good to learn that the 2 health care workers who had contact with the index cases are now classified as negative Marburg cases. These health care workers were previously considered suspected cases because they likely did not consider Marburg virus disease early in the course of the index case's disease and did not use personal protective equipment. What illness these 2 health care workers had is not stated in the above report. A new apparently suspected case from another location has been diagnosed and hospitalized, bringing the case count to one confirmed, one probable and one suspected. The above report does not indicate if this latest presumably suspected case has been laboratory confirmed. The confirmed index case is the 50-year-old woman who died. She had nursed her 42-year-old brother and was involved with preparation of his body for burial; he died on [Mon 25 Sep 2017] with similar signs and symptoms. He is a probable case.
