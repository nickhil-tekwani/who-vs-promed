[According to the report above, a total of 82 941 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 8 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (14 May 2020) report. The newly reported cases include 6 imported cases (5 in Shanghai, 1 in Hainan), and 2 indigenous cases (both in Jilin). In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there was 1 newly confirmed case reported in the past 24 hours. Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases. There have been a total of 1698 imported cases reported.

There were 13 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 12 locally acquired cases and 1 imported case. There was 1 imported case with conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 561, and 30 of these are importations from abroad. I realize it is repetitious mentioning this on a daily basis but..... It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic, in order to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As a reminder, it was reported on 24 Mar 2020 that China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. In the past few weeks, there have been locally transmitted clusters reported -- Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Wuhan. The world is watching carefully to see whether this was safe timing to lift the lockdown. The worrisome observation vis a vis the cluster in Wuhan is that the virus had most likely been circulating there undetected until the cluster was identified.

From the 15 May 2020 update in the English language page: https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030

- Of the 27 new cases [reported yesterday 14 May 2020], 5 were imported cases and 22 were locally transmitted cases.
-- 17 of the locally transmitted cases are related to the nightclub cluster; 7 are visitors to nightclubs/etc.; 10 are contacts.
-- 1 local case is related to a social gathering in Hongdae (in Mapo-gu, Seoul); further investigation on the chain of transmission is underway.
-- 3 local cases are contacts of previous confirmed case.
-- 1 local case is from Seoul City; further investigation on the chain of transmission is underway.

- 5 additional confirmed cases have been reported between 0:00 and 12:00 today [15 May 2020], bringing the total related to the cluster to 153. Contact investigation and infection control measures are underway.
-- By region: Seoul City=87, Gyeonggi Province=26, Incheon City=22, Chungbuk Province=9, Busan City=4, Chungnam Province=1, Jeonbuk Province=1, Gyeongnam Province=1, Gangwon Province=1, Jeju Province=1
-- By chain of transmission: club visitors=90; contacts (family/acquaintance/coworkers/etc.)=63
-- By age group: [0-18]=15; [19-29]=93; [30-39]=27; [40-49]=8; [50-59]=5; [60+]=5
-- Male=127; female=26

- KCDC asked anyone who visited any of the nightlife entertainment venues in Itaewon area including any clubs or bars from [24 Apr 2020] to [6 May 2020] to:
-- stay home and refrain from going to other places;
-- contact a local public health center or dial 1339 (KCDC call center);
-- visit a screening clinic and get tested, regardless of symptoms.

- KCDC also emphasized that persons who work in education, places of worship, indoor sports/gym facilities, or other places that are used by many people should especially report to public health center if they have been exposed to above venues since their work environment creates a high risk of transmission.

- Even if test result is negative, it is still possible for the person to have been infected but in the 14-day incubation period before the virus activates. Therefore, those who have been instructed to self-quarantine should strictly follow the self-quarantine protocol. Persons who are not subject to self-quarantine should still minimize contact with other people. They should carefully practice personal hygiene measures including mask wearing and hand washing, and get retested immediately if symptoms appear later.

- In light of the recent rise in local transmission from club cluster cases to others in bars, karaoke rooms, after-school private academies, KCDC urged people to refrain from social gathering or visiting any enclosed/confined/crowded spaces that are frequented by many people.
-- People who cannot avoid visiting an enclosed/crowded space for an essential reason should carefully follow personal hygiene measures including keeping 2 meters of distance from other people, wearing a facemask, avoiding handshakes, washing hands, and not touching eyes, nose, or mouth with their hands.
-- Persons belonging to high-risk groups (including elderly, pregnant women, persons with chronic illness) should especially avoid any poorly ventilated enclosed space frequented by many people. If such a situation cannot be avoided for an essential reason, it is highly important to wear a facemask.

- Religious communities should also be careful during the weekend since they can become exposed to a large number of people during weekend. Non-face-to-face, contactless methods of gathering are recommended.
-- Religious facilities hosting on-site worship gathering must check everyone for fever, maintain distance between participants, require mask wearing, and refrain from providing mass meals or encouraging any activity that cause respiratory droplets to travel (such as singing, chanting, shouting).

- Anyone who has come in close contact with a large number of unspecified persons in an enclosed/confined space such as clubs or bars need to be tested at a screening clinic through public health center or 1339 call center.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 19 cases and 2 deaths compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (14 to 15 May 2020) when there were 27 newly confirmed cases and 0 deaths. A total of 11 037 confirmed cases and 262 deaths were reported today (15 May 2020), up from 11 018 cases and 260 deaths yesterday (14 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 43 consecutive days and below 50 for 36 consecutive days. For several days, the count was below 10 but started climbing over the last 8 days. In today's (15 May 2020) breakdown of cases, 10 of the cases were import related and 9 were locally transmitted. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (5), Gyeonggi (2), and 1 each in Daegu and Chungbuk. Imported cases were in Quarantine (8) and Gyeonggi (2).

Figure 1: Daily confirmed cases by chain of transmission covers the period 1 Apr 2020 through 14 May 2020, on the English language page (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) is striking in the 10 day period with minimal local transmission and predominant importation, and the recent shift (5-14 May 2020) when local transmission replaced the majority imported cases.

The outbreak associated with the Itaewon clubs is now up to 153 cases including 63 contacts (family/acquaintance/coworkers/etc.). Yesterday (14 May 2020) there was mention of concern about another club district in Hongdae -- an area in Seoul around Hongik University, known for student nightlife with karaoke lounges and dance clubs. Many bars, cafes, and clubs are found in the area. No further mention of this concern.

As they move to the next phase -- "distancing in daily life" -- all eyes will be on the country to see whether they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be a main problem, but the growing Itaewon nightclub cluster and now possibly a 2nd club district are major concerns at this time. With these outbreaks associated with club districts in Seoul, there may be a rethinking of next steps.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 23 885 cases, including 31 610 deaths, up from 223 096 cases and 31 368 deaths reported on 14 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 14 and 15 May 2020, was 789 newly confirmed cases, compared with 992 newly confirmed cases between 13 and 14 May 2020, a decrease from yesterday's (14 May 2020) change. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 67.7% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 37.9% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Piedmont is the only other province reporting 100 or more newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 10 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases (2 provinces, Basilicata and Bolzano, reported no new cases), and another 6 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission. Emilia-Romagna, Liguria and Lazio are 3 provinces reporting 50 or more cases (but less than 100).

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 63 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 62 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 116 635 total cases, 6902 deaths
Date: Fri 15 May 2020 3:21 PM
Source: New Straits Times, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]
https://www.nst.com.my/world/world/2020/05/592910/covid-19-iran-reports-2102-new-cases-past-24-hours


Iran on Friday [15 May 2020] reported its highest number of new COVID-19 coronavirus infections in more than a month as it warned of clusters hitting new regions. The Islamic republic has struggled to contain COVID-19 since its 1st cases emerged in mid-February [2020].

Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 2102 new cases were confirmed across the country in the past 24 hours, bringing the overall total to 116 635. That figure is the highest Iran has announced for a single day since [6 Apr 2020]. Jahanpour said the virus had claimed another 48 lives over the same period, raising the overall death toll to 6902.

The southwestern province of Khuzestan remained "red" - the top level of Iran's colour-coded risk scale. Several more provinces could be added to that level of alert, he said. "Other provinces that we may see rising infections are Lorestan, Sistan and Baluchistan, and East Azerbaijan," Jahanpour said in televised remarks.

The spokesman issued what he called a "warning" to residents of the provinces to observe health protocols. Lorestan lies in western Iran, East Azerbaijan in the northwest, and Sistan and Baluchestan in the southeast bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan. Jahanpour had said on Thursday [14 May 2020] that North Khorasan province in the northeast may also be close to "critical condition."

Khuzestan is the only province so far where authorities have reimposed stringent measures like shutting businesses after a countrywide relaxation in April [2020]. Iran stopped publishing provincial figures for the coronavirus last month [April 2020]. A spokesman for the province's virus taskforce, Reza Nejati, said on Thursday [14 May 2020] schools will not reopen in Khuzestan later this week, ISNA news agency reported. Iran closed schools in early March [2020] along with universities and public places including cinemas to contain the virus. But it announced last week that schools would partially reopen as of Saturday [16 May 2020] with only teachers present as students' attendance is not mandatory.

The government also reopened mosques on Wednesday [13 May 2020] for 3 nights so that worshippers could pray during one of the holiest times of the year for Muslims. The reopening was granted for Laylat al-Qadr -- a high point during the fasting month of Ramadan that marks when the Koran was revealed to Prophet Mohammed.

Of those hospitalised with COVID-19 nationwide since the 1st cases announced in the Shiite holy city of Qom on [19 Feb 2020], 91 836 have recovered and been discharged, according to the health ministry. Experts both at home and abroad have voiced skepticism about Iran's official figures, saying the real toll could be much higher.

[In the 24 hours from 14 to 15 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 114 533 to 116 635, an increase of 2102 compared with 1808 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (14 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 6854 to 6902, an increase of 48 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Spain, Russia, the UK, Italy, Brazil, France, Germany, and Turkey (Worldometer data as of 15 May 2020; 21:53 EDT). As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening, and, unfortunately, it appears as though the opening may have been premature as daily newly confirmed case counts are increasing. The caution that there is usually a 2-3 week lag between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths, so it may be too early to conclude there aren't increases in deaths. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

Notice the comment re: probable under-reporting... It's actually fatiguing to read those comments in media reports of countries with significant caseloads... most countries with significant numbers of cases have had under-reporting of cases and deaths, due to testing limitations, deaths at home without testing etc., over reaching of surge capacity in healthcare facilities, etc.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 484 285, including 88 507 deaths, an increase from 1 457 593 cases and 86 912 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 356 016 (24.0%) cumulative case reports and 2920 (10.9%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is still clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 187 848 as of 1:00 PM EDT on 15 May 2020, including 15 422 confirmed deaths and an additional 5054 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in New York (2920 -- 10.9%), Illinois (2432 -- 9.1%), California (2034 -- 7.6%), Texas (2012 -- 7.5%), New Jersey (1466 -- 5.5%), Massachusetts (1239 -- 4.6%), Maryland (1083 -- 4.1%) , and Pennsylvania (1041 -- 3.9%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas, Florida, and Maryland.

Repeating from previous days, more sobering, if you treat each state as a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1, followed by Spain, Russia, UK, Italy, Brazil, France, Turkey, and New Jersey as number 10. Number 11 would be Iran, 12 Illinois, 13 India 14 Peru, 15 Massachusetts 16 China, 17 California, 18 Canada, 19 Pennsylvania, and 20 Belgium. China has moved down to 16th place. 6 US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL). Even more sobering is that New York City itself would be between Brazil and France (it would be number 7).

The US military has confirmed 8374 cumulative cases, with 77 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 11 897 cumulative cases and 130 new cases today (15 May 2020). There have been 3629 cases reported from federal prisons (no new cases in the past 24 hours) and 3632 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (240 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 2542 cases (115 new cases in the past 24 hours). Other states with increased activity include Florida with 928 newly confirmed cases, Virginia with 859 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, Minnesota with 805 newly confirmed cases, Georgia with 795 newly confirmed cases, Connecticut with 621 newly confirmed cases, and Indiana with 602 newly confirmed cases. 29 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations, and not antibody based tests, to WHO, since 25 Apr 2020. The antibody-confirmed cases are now available in Table 4, which presents all cases including all tests performed. There were 549 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the past 24 hours compared with 506 in the preceding 24-hour period [from 12 to 13 May 2020], bringing the PCR [plus number confirmed including all tests] confirmed cumulative total to 230 183 [274 367] cases as compared with 229 540 [272 646] confirmed cases on 13 May 2020. Daily death reports are decreasing as well, with 27 459 deaths reported today (14 May 2020) and 27 321 deaths reported on 13 May 2020, an increase of 138 deaths in 24 hours.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 22.77, a continual slow decrease over the past 25 days from a high of 214.4 on 7 Apr 2020 to 22.77 today (14 May 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 230 183 [274 367] cases, an additional 346 cases have been hospitalized, and an additional 29 cases were admitted to ICU. 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.
