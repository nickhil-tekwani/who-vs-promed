Severe food poisoning outbreaks linked to consumption of raw milk products have struck Waikato and Manawatu [regions], prompting a leading health expert to advise caution.

Ministry of Health data released under the Official Information Act show 19 people were hospitalized in 2013 after consuming raw milk products.

A total of 4 people were hospitalized in Waikato on 5 Mar 2013 after contracting potentially deadly _E. coli_ infections. The next day 5 more people fell ill with the bacterium.

In April 2013, 6 more were struck down with _Campylobacter_, which causes gastroenteritis. Scientists determined that consumption of raw milk products was a common factor.

Massey University EpiLab director and food safety Professor Nigel French said people should think carefully about raw food. "We're not wanting to wrap people in cotton wool . . . I feel strongly that people should have the choice to eat raw food if they want to -- but they should do it in full knowledge of the potential risks to their health."

Raw milk products are illegal in many countries, including Australia and Canada, and in Britain they must carry health warnings.

[The following is from a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) information sheet regarding unpasteurized milk (http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/consumers/ucm079516.htm):

"Milk and milk products provide a wealth of nutrition benefits. But raw milk can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious health risks to you and your family. According to an analysis by the CDC, between 1993 and 2006 more than 1500 people in the USA became sick from drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk. In addition, CDC reported that unpasteurized milk is 150 times more likely to cause foodborne illness and results in 13 times more hospitalizations than illnesses involving pasteurized dairy products.

Raw milk is milk from cows, sheep, or goats that has not been pasteurized to kill harmful bacteria. This raw, unpasteurized milk can carry dangerous bacteria such as _Salmonella_, _E. coli_, and _Listeria_, which are responsible for causing numerous foodborne illnesses.

These harmful bacteria can seriously affect the health of anyone who drinks raw milk, or eats foods made from raw milk. However, the bacteria in raw milk can be especially dangerous to people with weakened immune systems, older adults, pregnant women, and children. In fact, the CDC analysis found that foodborne illness from raw milk especially affected children and teenagers.

"Pasteurized milk" explained
----------------------------
Pasteurization is a process that kills harmful bacteria by heating milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time; 1st developed by Louis Pasteur in 1864, pasteurization kills harmful organisms responsible for such diseases as listeriosis, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, diphtheria, and brucellosis.

Research shows no meaningful difference in the nutritional values of pasteurized and unpasteurized milk. Pasteurized milk contains low levels of the type of nonpathogenic bacteria that can cause food spoilage, so storing your pasteurized milk in the refrigerator is still important.

Raw milk and pasteurization: debunking milk myths
-------------------------------------------------
While pasteurization has helped provide safe, nutrient-rich milk and cheese for over 120 years, some people continue to believe that pasteurization harms milk and that raw milk is a safe, healthier alternative.

Here are some common myths and proven facts about milk and pasteurization:
Pasteurizing milk DOES NOT cause lactose intolerance and allergic reactions. Both raw milk and pasteurized milk can cause allergic reactions in people sensitive to milk proteins.
Raw milk DOES NOT kill dangerous pathogens by itself.
Pasteurization DOES NOT reduce milk's nutritional value.
Pasteurization DOES NOT mean that it is safe to leave milk out of the refrigerator for extended time, particularly after it has been opened.
Pasteurization DOES kill harmful bacteria.
Pasteurization DOES save lives." - Mod.LL
