A case of tularemia, also known as rabbit fever, has been registered
in the Amur region for the 1st time over the past 50 years, the
regional sanitary and epidemiological commission said at a meeting on
Fri 7 Dec 2007.

The diagnosis was confirmed on a hunter of the Selemdzhin district,
who was bitten by a sable. Regional sanitary doctors plan to begin
vaccination of a risk group that includes hunters, foresters, and
geologists of the Selemdzhin and Mazanovsky districts.

Natural cases of tularemia occur across North America, Europe, and
Asia. It is a disease that humans can catch either from tick, fly,
and mosquito bites or from animal contact.

[The manifestations of tularemia in the hunter are not stated but may
well been ulceroglandular. The sable is a small mammal, closely
related to the marten, that lives in southern Russia near the Ural
Mountains through Siberia and Mongolia to Hokkaido in Japan. Its
range in the wild originally extended through European Russia to
Poland and Scandinavia. It has achieved fame for its fur. A picture
can be found at

Despite the apparent rarity of diagnosis in Amur, tularemia is
endemic in Russia including the entire Asian part.

The Amur Oblast is a federal region of Russia (an oblast), situated
about 8000 km (4970 mi) east of Moscow on the banks of the Amur and
Zeya Rivers. It can be found on a map at
