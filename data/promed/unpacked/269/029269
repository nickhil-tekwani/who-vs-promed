A Texas laboratory worker processing specimens from last fall's anthrax
attacks under a federal contract has become ill with the skin form of
anthrax, the first domestic case of the disease since November and a
reminder that the ongoing bioterrorism investigation continues to carry
risks. The worker is being treated with antibiotics and is recovering from
the infection, which appears to have been acquired in the laboratory.
But a preliminary investigation by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta suggests there were irregularities in the way the
potentially infectious specimens were handled by the worker after he became
ill. That has raised concerns among some experts that some of the specimens
under study from last fall's attacks may not be subject to adequate
accounting.
The patient was working in a private laboratory, one of several with which
the CDC has contracted in recent months to work through a backlog of
specimens collected during the peak of last fall's attacks. The specimens
include tens of thousands of environmental swabs that investigators hope
will give them a measure of how far and wide anthrax spores spread at
contaminated sites. Each swab is being tested for the presence of _Bacillus
anthracis_.
The lab worker went to his doctor 4 Mar 2002 because of an unusual skin
lesion on his neck, said CDC spokesman Tom Skinner. The doctor swabbed the
lesion. But rather than sending the swab to a county or state health lab
for analysis, as is standard practice when anthrax is suspected, the doctor
gave the swab to the worker, who brought it to the lab where he worked.
There he or his co-workers analyzed the specimen, obtaining preliminary
evidence of cutaneous anthrax.
The lab staff contacted the CDC, which late last week sent a team of
investigators to look into the apparent laboratory exposure. Yesterday,
tests conducted by the CDC on the doctor's office specimen confirmed it was
positive for the anthrax bacterium. "We still don't know the circumstances
in the lab that led to him getting infected," Skinner said.
Several experts said that the worker's efforts to keep the specimens under
his personal control appeared to be unusual. And ... the apparent lack of
tight control over specimens at the lab was worrisome.
Skinner emphasized that this lab is not a member of the CDC's Laboratory
Response Network, a web of about 110 facilities around the country under
contract with CDC to help out in public health emergencies. Rather, he
said, it was one of several additional labs helping with the huge number of
specimens that need to be tested.

[Laboratory infections are infrequent but they do still occur. I am puzzled
by the security concerns, as the pathogen left the laboratory as an unknown
skin infection and returned for confirmation, presumably by the patient's
expert colleagues. And the positive lesion was reported to CDC. Too much
double guessing going on. That it was a skin lesion on the neck is of more
concern, achieved either by scratching the neck with a contaminated gloved
hand (poor lab discipline) or from an aerosol contamination while working
in the laboratory and cloth rubbing against the skin. Laboratory aerosols
can be generated from splashes to centrifuges. It should be noted that the
enormous volumes of samples and pressure to get them processed have been
extraordinary. - Mod.MHJ]
