Nausea, chest pains, breathing difficulties, skin rashes -- those were just a few of the complaints of the 65 people who suddenly fell ill at Monmouth County Courthouse today [19 Jun 2012].

It was the 2nd time in 2 business days the courthouse had to be evacuated because of a mysterious problem and, as a result, the building will be closed Tuesday [19 Jun 2012], county spokesperson William Heine said.

The mass illness brought more than a dozen ambulances, sheriff's emergency vans and a county HazMat unit to the courthouse in Freehold Borough. 25 people were taken to CentraState Medical Center in Freehold township and Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune between noon and 1 p.m. Another 40 were treated outside the courthouse where a triage and treatment area was set up.

"For the safety and well-being of employees and individuals with business at the courthouse, the county is cooperating with the state Judiciary to close the building," Deputy County Administrator Kevin Burke said in a statement.

"Most employees were notified as they returned from their lunch break today. Individuals with business at the courthouse were informed as they arrived at the courthouse."

On Friday [15 Jun 2012], when 17 people became ill, the incident was confined to the 1st floor of the west wing and led the county to clean the affected areas over the weekend [16-17 Jun 2012]. At the time, the cause was attributed to cut flowers, which were all removed on Friday, but after today's incident, Heine said "the flowers have been ruled out."

He also added there was "no indication of foul play."

Heine said a state judiciary safety officer spent the afternoon at the building, located on Court and Monmouth Streets, testing for volatile chemical compounds. Initial tests came back negative, he said, and a company under contract with the county was being brought in last night to examine the courthouse for dust, pollen, and mold.

In Burke's statement, he said, "It is believed that there is no danger of person-to-person transmission. Anyone who was at the courthouse today should launder the clothes that they wore separately from other items. Individuals should also shower with soap and water as well.

"If a courthouse employee or anyone having business at the courthouse is experiencing any of the symptoms, we encourage them to go to the emergency room or their private physician.

"We also ask that they contact the county health department at 732-431-7456 to report any symptoms."

[The symptoms reported here are broad and could be from a number of things. The number of people involved may lead us to believe it is an aerosol transmission of some kind, and may be chemically related. One has to wonder what chemicals are being used to clean the building, or what kind of cleaning was occurring in the building at the time of the incident. One may also wonder if there is any type of mold in the air handling systems. Molds can mimic chemical and disease situations.

This sounds a bit like a syndrome known as "sick building syndrome" (SBS). The term is used to describe situations in which building occupants experience acute health and comfort effects that appear to be linked to time spent in a building, but no specific illness or cause can be identified. The complaints may be localized in a particular room or zone, or may be widespread throughout the building. In contrast, the term "building related illness" (BRI) is used when symptoms of diagnosable illness are identified and can be attributed directly to airborne building contaminants.

A 1984 World Health Organization Committee report suggested that up to 30 percent of new and remodeled buildings worldwide may be the subject of excessive complaints related to indoor air quality (IAQ). Often this condition is temporary, but some buildings have long-term problems. Frequently, problems result when a building is operated or maintained in a manner that is inconsistent with its original design or prescribed operating procedures. Sometimes indoor air problems are a result of poor building design or occupant activities.

Indicators of SBS include:
- Building occupants complain of symptoms associated with acute discomfort, such as headache; eye, nose, or throat irritation; dry cough; dry or itchy skin; dizziness and nausea; difficulty in concentrating; fatigue; and sensitivity to odors.
- The cause of the symptoms is not known.
- Most of the complainants report relief soon after leaving the building.

Indicators of BRI include:
- Building occupants complain of symptoms such as cough; chest tightness; fever, chills; and muscle aches.
- The symptoms can be clinically defined and have clearly identifiable causes.
- Complainants may require prolonged recovery times after leaving the building.

It is important to note that complaints may result from other causes. These may include an illness contracted outside the building, acute sensitivity (such as allergies), job related stress or dissatisfaction, and other psychosocial factors. Nevertheless, studies show that symptoms may be caused or exacerbated by indoor air quality problems.

There appear to be a number of possible causes of SBS including inadequate air ventilation; chemical use in the building or from a source outside the building being carried in by the ventilation system; biological sources such as mold in the building or the ventilation system; and such things as asbestos or radon.

To understand each situation and possible remediation of these, readers are referred to the US Environmental Protection Agency posting on Sick Building Syndrome at http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pdfs/sick_building_factsheet.pdf, from which portions of this comment have been extracted:

We hope that someone with authoritative information will keep us informed.
