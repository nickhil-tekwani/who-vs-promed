Officials: Tests Show Presence of Anthrax in Second Florida Man
---------------------------------------------------
BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- Preliminary tests show the presence of anthrax in
a second Florida man, but it was not yet clear if he has a full-blown case
of the disease that killed one of his co-workers last week, officials said
early Monday. A nasal swab from the man, whose name was not immediately
made public, tested positive for the anthrax bacterium [_Bacillus
anthracis_, said Tim O'Conner, regional spokesman for the Florida
Department of Health. The second man was in stable condition at an
unidentified hospital, according to a statement issued late Sunday night by
the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
O'Conner said he couldn't say that the second case was related to
terrorism. "That would take a turn in the investigation," said O'Conner.
"It's a different aspect, we were thinking more of environmental" sources.
"We did get a positive nasal sample from a person who is a person who
worked with the person who died," of anthrax, confirmed Barbara Reynolds, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
Authorities in North Carolina also have been looking for possible sources
of anthrax since last week, when [a 63-year-old man, who worked at the
supermarket tabloid the Sun, was confirmed to be suffering from anthrax.
[The patient, of Lantana, Fla., died of the disease on Friday. [The
patient, the first person in 25 years in the United States to catch a case
of the rare and deadly inhalation form of anthrax, had recently visited
North Carolina. It was unclear when the final tests would tell whether or
not the second man has anthrax. The bacteria normally has an incubation
period of up to seven days, but could take up to 60 days to develop,
O'Conner said. "We're waiting for additional testing to see if it will
become a confirmed case of anthrax or not," said Reynolds in a telephone
interview from Atlanta. "I realize for the public this is going to be a
very slight distinction."
In addition, environmental tests performed at the Sun's offices in Boca
Raton have detected the anthrax bacteria [_Bacillus anthracis, said
O'Conner, who was reading from a statement he said would be made public
later Monday by Florida Secretary of Health John Agwunobi. The Sun's
offices were closed off and law enforcement, local and state health and CDC
officials were to take additional samples from the building later Monday,
O'Conner said.
The FBI was helping in the search for the source of the bacteria, said
Miami FBI spokeswoman Judy Orihuela. Employees at the newspaper would not
be going to work Monday, O'Conner said. He said about 300 people who work
in the building were being contacted by the Sun and instructed to undergo
antibiotic treatment to prevent the disease. But "the current risk of
anthrax is extremely low," O'Conner said. People who have just been
visitors to the building, he said, should not seek antibiotic treatment.
Michael Kahane, vice president and general counsel of American Media Inc.,
which publishes the Sun and two other tabloids, the Globe and the National
Enquirer, confirmed the company closed its Boca Raton building at the
request of state health officials. "We are cooperating with the department
of health and all other governmental agencies investigating this matter.
"Obviously are first concern is the health and well-being of our employees
and their families," Kahane said, "and we will be conducting business
(Monday) from facilities other than our Boca Raton building."

[It is fairly busy out there so it is hard to get additional information.
However, the 300 workers at The Sun have been sent home with 15 days of
ciprofloxacin. A positive swab was obtained from Steven's computer
keyboard. How many other environmental samples were taken in his office and
desk is not known. The circumstances for the second positive are unclear
but it seems at this time that he was found when all Steven's coworkers
were nasally swabbed, suggesting that he was well at the time, but this is
speculation until there is more information; alternative readings would
have him ill at the time he was swabbed. When one considers the timing of
Steven's illness -- he started to feel ill on Sunday September 30th, drove
back to Lake Worth on the 1st October and into hospital the next morning,
the shortest co-exposure would have been on Tuesday 25th or Wednesday 26th
September and his colleague's nose is (still) positive 11 days later. -

5 People Treated After Receive Envelope With Mystery Powder
------------------------------------------------------------
HIALEAH, Fla. (AP) -- 5 people were hospitalized Sunday after they opened 2
manila envelopes containing a mysterious white powder, rescue officials
said. One person at an apartment complex in this Miami suburb was taken to
the hospital Sunday after opening an envelope containing the powder,
Hialeah Fire-Rescue Department officials said. The person's condition was
not immediately available.
That came one day after 4 people at a house 20 blocks [?away opened an
envelope containing an apparently identical powder. 3 of the 4 occupants of
the house -- a 72-year-old man, his 72-year-old sister-in-law, his
36-year-old daughter and a 70-year-old woman -- developed low-grade fevers
after they arrived Sunday at Palm Springs General Hospital, said Stanley
Stark, a fire-rescue spokesman. He did not know which.
The man was going through the home's mail Saturday afternoon when he opened
the business-size envelope containing the powder. The home's occupants
initially did not think much of the substance, but their fears it could be
something harmful grew overnight and they alerted authorities Sunday
morning, Stark said. The FBI and a hazardous materials team from Hialeah
Fire-Rescue quarantined the one-story home, taking the mail and the
clothing the occupants wore at the time the envelope was opened, Stark said.
Neighbors on both sides of the home, who had previously been told not to go
outside, were allowed to leave. Entry to the block, which had not been
permitted earlier, was granted. It was unclear what the powder was and why
the family received a letter containing an unknown substance, Stark said.
The FBI was hoping to complete preliminary testing of the substance late
Sunday.

[At a time like this people will do some strange and nasty things to take
advantage of the hysteria of the moment. There has been no confirmation on
this story as to a real risk. It has all the hallmarks of a very nasty
hoax. There have been a number of people examined to see if they had
anthrax but none were clinically or microbiologically confirmed -- other
than this one fellow with a positive nasal swab. All such reports of white
powders in the mail should regarded with skepticism until there is hard
evidence of a real risk. And such envelopes should be referred immediately
to the police for appropriate action. - Mod.MHJ

I would point out the importance of pathological exam in the emerging
infections / BT work in general. In this particular case, it may well tell
us the portal of entry and how the meningeal "cardinal's cap" which is
expected may have come about.
A few years ago pathological exam in the USSR provided definitive proof of
the existence of inhalation anthrax following the Sverdlovsk incident. In
fact the early literature of anthrax has lots of good information on early
events in the infection based on finding spores and sporulation in critical
areas of the lung at critical times. It is also worth reflecting that when
you look, you find.
I do not want to suggest that a deep intelligence and epidemiological
investigation of this case should not be undertaken -- clearly this is a
high priority. I would like to add that more awareness of some of the less
well-appreciated infectious diseases will give us lots of new info on
previously under-recognized conditions, stress the limited resources of the
public health system, and generally improve our understanding of infectious
disease.
