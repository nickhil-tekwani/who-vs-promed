Pakistan: Outbreak of Viral Haemorrhagic Fever in Sindh Province
----------------------------------------------------------------
Hospitals in southern Pakistan were on alert after haemorrhagic fever was
confirmed to have killed 5 people in 6 weeks, including a woman doctor. More
than 40 others are infected and are being treated in hospitals in Karachi,
Pakistan's biggest city, a top health official in the government of Sindh
province told Agence France Presse.
Doctors in Karachi have been ordered to take special protective measures, as
the disease can be spread by the massive bleeding which patients with the
fever suffer, the official said on Fri 25 Nov 2005.
Pakistan has suffered a number of cases of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in
recent years. An outbreak in 2004 claimed 3 lives in southwestern Baluchistan
which borders Sindh province. Haemorrhagic fevers are a group of illnesses
caused by a tick-borne virus. Symptoms start with headaches and vomiting,
followed by bleeding through the nose, mouth and ears and in internal organs.
There are few effective treatments and no known cure.
All 5 of the latest deaths were confirmed on Fri 25 Nov 2005 as cases of viral
haemorrhagic fever [presumably caused by Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever
virus. - Mod.CP], the official stated.
39 patients have been admitted to the private Aga Khan hospital while 5 are in
government hospitals. All are in isolation wards, he added. Doctors protested
after the female medic at the state-run Civil Hospital Karachi died of the
virus last week, demanding better protection and facilities to cope with the
outbreak. The 25-year-old doctor was admitted to Aga Khan Hospital bleeding
profusely from her mouth, ears and nose a week ago and was kept in the
isolation ward, where she died.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a member of the genus
_Nairovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_, a family of segmented genome
negative-sense RNA viruses. CCHFV is the cause of a zoonotic disease that for
many years was recognized only in Central Asia and eastern Europe, but is
known now to be present throughout Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
(The viruses causing Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fevers belong to the
family _Filoviridae_, an unrelated family of unimolecular genome negative-
sense RNA viruses. The filoviruses have not been isolated so far in the Indian
sub-continent).
In recent years, CCHFV-associated disease has been particularly prevalent in
countries bordering the Persian Gulf, where traditional sheep slaughtering and
butchering practices continue. The virus is maintained by a cycle involving
transovarial and transstadial transmission in _Hyalomma_ spp. and related
ticks. The larval and nymphal ticks become infected during feeding on small
mammals and birds, and the adults during feeding on wild and domestic
ruminants. Infection of wild and domestic ruminants results in abundant
production of CCHFV. Remarkably, there is no evidence of clinical disease in
animals other than humans, where the outcome can be a severe hemorrhagic fever.
The circumstances surrounding the current outbreak of CCHFV infection in Sindh
province of Pakistan are not stated. Further information would be appreciated.
The death of a woman doctor is not surprising, because nosocomial transmission
of infection can occur, although hospitals in Pakistan would be expected to be
aware of the risk. In 2002, a female doctor in a hospital in Rawalpindi
contracted CCHFV infection from a patient and died. 2 doctors involved in her
treatment also contracted infection; both survived. Previously, in 1974, a
physician died in Rawalpindi General Hospital as a result of CCHFV infection
contracted from patients. - Mod.CP]
