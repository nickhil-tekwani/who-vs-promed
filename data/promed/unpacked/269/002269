Following a confirmed outbreak in French Polynesia: 3 cases of Zika fever have been reported in New Caledonia. All cases were imported from French Polynesia.

Symptoms of Zika fever include high temperature, headache, red eyes, skin rash, muscle aches, and joint pains.

The mosquito [capable of] carrying the virus in New Caledonia is _Aedes aegypti_ that can bite during the day but not night, both inside and out, and lives around buildings in urban areas.

Travellers coming from French Polynesia when arriving in New Caledonia are being advised to use insect repellants, during 7 days after landing, and wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants, and to consult a general practitioner if symptoms are occurring. Sleeping in screened rooms or under bed nets is recommended only for young children and sick people.

If these individuals were viremic on arrival, there is a significant risk of ongoing transmission of Zika virus in New Caledonia.

[The number of reported Zika virus infection cases imported into New Caledonia has increased from 2 to 3. The islands in French Polynesia affected by the Zika virus outbreak this year (2013) are: Tahiti, Moorea, Raiatea, Tahaa, Bora Bora, Nuku Hiva, and Arutua. There was a major outbreak of Zika virus infections on Yap and nearby islands of the Federated Republic of Micronesia in 2007. The vector mosquito of this flavivirus virus is _Aedes aegypti_.

ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sylvie Laumond for sending in this new report, along with the URL for the Government of New Caledonia's Department of Health and Social Affairs brief report of these cases (in French) (http://www.dass.gouv.nc/portal/page/portal/dass/alertes). ProMED would welcome any additional reports of new imported Zika virus infections or locally acquired ones.
