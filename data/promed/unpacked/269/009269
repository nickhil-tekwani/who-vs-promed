1st Report of Seedling Blight Caused by
_Sclerotium rolfsii_ on Wheat in Oklahoma
-----------------------------------------------
V. Choppakatla and R. M. Hunger, Department of
Entomology and Plant Pathology, Oklahoma State
University, Stillwater 74078; and H. A. Melouk,
USDA-ARS, Stillwater, OK. Plant Dis. 90:686,

Feb 2006.
Wheat (_Triticum aestivum_) is an important crop
in Oklahoma and throughout the Central Plains of
the United States. The soilborne fungus,
_Sclerotium rolfsii_, is a major pathogen on
peanut (_Arachis hypogaea_) but is not known to
cause major damage on wheat. During September of
1998, damping-off and rotting of young wheat
seedlings were observed in breeder plots in Payne
County, OK. The occurrence of symptoms was
sporadic with an estimated stand reduction of 10
to 15 percent. Symptomatic plants were collected
from the field and brought to the laboratory.
Sclerotia-like bodies from the symptomatic plants
were surface disinfested in aqueous one percent
NaOCl for 2 min and allowed to germinate at 25 �
2 C on sterile filter paper moistened with a one
percent aqueous solution of methanol. Aerial
mycelia from germinating sclerotia were
transferred to potato dextrose agar amended with
100 ppm of streptomycin (SPDA) to obtain pure
cultures. Pure cultures had coarse, white
mycelium distinctive of _S. rolfsii_ and produced
very small (0.05 to 0.1 mm), abundant, round,
brown sclerotia on the surface of the medium
after 15 days of incubation. Pathogenicity was
tested on 3 hard red winter wheat cultivars
commonly grown in Oklahoma (Jagger, 2137, and
2174). Four plants of each cultivar were
inoculated at the 2-leaf stage (Feekes' scale
stage 1) by placing a 0.5-cm agar disk removed
from a 3-day-old culture onto a 1-cm diameter
filter paper that was then pressed to the base of
the shoot. Noninoculated plants were used as a
control. After inoculation, pots were covered
with polyethylene sheets to maintain 95 to 100
percent relative humidity and incubated at 25 � 2
C in the greenhouse. Lesions were initially
superficial, yellowish, and water soaked. Lesions
expanded and resulted in damping-off of
seedlings. Noninoculated plants were free of
disease and remained healthy. No significant
difference (P < 0.05) in disease severity was
observed among the cultivars. To fulfill Koch's
postulates, the fungus was reisolated onto SPDA
where it had the same characteristics as the
initial culture. To our knowledge, this is the
1st report of _S. rolfsii_ on wheat in Oklahoma.
Even though _S. rolfsii_ is not expected to pose
a significant risk to wheat production, infection
of wheat may enhance survival of _S. rolfsii_ and
facilitate infection and losses in a following
peanut crop. This is especially important in
certain areas of Oklahoma where a wheat-peanut
rotation is occasionally practiced.

[The crop plant wheat (_Triticum aestivum_)
develops symptoms of the disease seedling blight
when infected by the fungus _Sclerotium rolfsii_,
which is a major pathogen on peanut (_Arachis
hypogaea_), where it also causes seedling blight.
This report of _S. rolfsii_ on wheat in a single
plot of experimental wheat is unusual, and the
authors point out the possible threat to peanut
crops from seedling blight were they to be
planted on land that had grown infected wheat in
a previous cropping period. There are no previous
postings in ProMED-mail on this disease in either
wheat or peanut. A different seedling blight of
wheat can be caused by the fungal pathogen
_Fusarium graminearum_.
_Sclerotium rolfsii_, is an omnivorous, soilborne
fungal pathogen that causes disease on a wide
range of agricultural and horticultural crops.
Although no worldwide compilation of host genera
has been published, over 270 host genera have
been reported in the United States alone.
Susceptible agricultural hosts include sweet
potato (_Ipomea batatas_), pumpkin (_Cucurbita
pepo_), corn (_Zea mays_), wheat (_Triticum
vulgare_) and peanut (_Arachis hypogea_). From a
global perspective peanut crops sustain higher
losses than any other agricultural crop. In 1959,
the United States Department of Agriculture
estimated losses from USD 10 million to 20
million associated with _S. rolfsii_ in the
southern peanut-growing region, with yield losses
ranging from 1-60 percent in fields in the NC
coastal plains region. The fungus develops
protective structures known as sclerotia, and
these contain viable hyphae that can serve as
primary inoculum for disease development. The
sclerotia also serve as the principal
overwintering structures and primary inoculum for
disease. Persisting near the soil surface,
sclerotia may exist free in the soil or in
association with plant debris. Those buried deep
in the soil may survive for a year or less,
whereas those at the surface remain viable and
may germinate in response to alcohols and other
volatiles released from decomposing plant
material. Thus, deep plowing serves as a cultural
control tactic by burying sclerotia deep in the
soil. Since _S. rolfsii_ does not produce spores,
dissemination depends on movement of infested
soil and infected plant material. Use of
contaminated equipment and machinery may spread
sclerotia to uninfested fields. Cool, moist
weather is required for southern blight, which
usually appears during fall or late summer. There
is a biosecurity issue associated with _S.
rolfsii_, and it appears on lists of potential
bioterrorism agents. Its broad host range, rapid
action and general recalcitrance to fungicides
make it an attractive candidate for such lists.
