According to the Idaho State Department of Agriculture, 2 horses in Bonneville County were euthanized after displaying neurological signs consistent with equine herpesvirus, EHV-1.

Laboratory testing conducted on one of the horses, prior to its death, confirmed the horse to be positive for the neurologic strain of EHV-1.

Equine herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses. Llamas and alpacas are occasionally affected but the virus poses no health threat to humans. Signs frequently associated with EHV-1 infection in horses include a fever, lack of coordination, hind-end weakness, lethargy, incontinence and diminished tail tone.

The virus is easily spread by airborne transmission, horse-to-horse contact and through contact with nasal secretions on equipment, tack, feed, and other surfaces. People can spread the virus to horses by means of contaminated hands, clothing, shoes and vehicles. Currently, there is no equine vaccine to protect against the neurological strain of the EHV-1 virus.

Deputy State Veterinarian Dr Scott Leibsle is recommending horse owners incorporate preventative biosecurity measures while transporting or boarding horses at facilities that have regular traffic on and off the grounds and especially where they are likely to come in contact with new or unfamiliar horses such as at a racetrack, rodeo, or fairgrounds.

Simple guidelines such as disinfecting a stall before using it, never sharing water buckets, feed buckets, tack, or grooming equipment as well as avoiding unnecessary contact with other horses will go a long way in minimizing a horse's risk of contracting the virus.

"I encourage owners to contact their veterinarian immediately if and when they observe any signs of illness in their horses," said Dr Leibsle. EHV-1 is also a Notifiable Disease to the State Veterinarian in Idaho.

Anyone suspecting or confirming a case of EHV-1 should call (208) 332-8540 or (208) 332-8570 to report cases.

[The state of Idaho can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2933128,2234. Bonneville County in eastern Idaho can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/idaho-county-map.gif.

This disease can spread fairly fast. It is often recommended to take the animal's temperature at least twice a day to help catch an early rise, which may be the 1st sign of the disease. If there is a rise in resting temperature (1st thing in the morning, before the animals have begun to move around much), then it is advisable to contact your veterinarian immediately.

This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
