Mysterious pest targets valuable palm trees
-------------------------------------------
Something is decimating the coconut and other palm trees [n Antigua] and no one seems to know exactly what it is.

"Palms -- some coconut, some ornamentals -- have been dying. [The] situation is affecting the crown area causing rapid death," explained Janil Gore Francis, Plant Protection Unit. "Up to now we have not been able to definitively say what the problem is."

Officials say the coconut may not only help to preserve health, but also boosts Antigua's economy. But over the past 6 months, the coconut trees have been falling prey to the mysterious disease.

The scourge was first identified in the north of the island and appears to be steadily spreading. Dr Gore Francis said that it may be caused by an insect.

Paul Hoetjes, ministry of economic affairs, agriculture and innovation in the Netherlands, said that what is happening in Antigua is not unique. "This sounds very similar to the disease currently killing off coconut palms on St. Eustatius, which is a well-known scourge called lethal yellowing."

Drought, disease leave coconut growers in distress
--------------------------------------------------
Drought and disease have devastated coconut growers in the district [of Tumkur, Karnataka]. Various diseases, including pest attack and stem bleeding, have ravaged crops on thousands of acres. Coconut trees in rain-fed regions have withered.

[The state] Horticulture department said that pesticides have been distributed among farmers at a subsidised rate, but the spread of diseases has not come under control.

[A range of diseases of coconut palms have been reported from the Caribbean and India.

Lethal yellowing (LY) diseases are caused by phytoplasmas of the palm lethal yellowing (LY or 16SrIV) group. A number of LY strains have been described from the Caribbean, but the picture provided in article [1] above does not appear to resemble typical LY symptoms. St Eustatius has not previously been mentioned in reports of LY (Hugh Harries, personal communication). For more information on LY see links below.

A number of fungal rots and wilts could lead to the "withering" described in item [2].

Stem bleeding of coconut may be caused by the soil-borne fungus _Ceratocystis paradoxa_, which infects wounds in the trunk.
