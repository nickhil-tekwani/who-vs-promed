Human trichinellosis outbreak in Vojvodina and Montenegro
---------------------------------------------
At the end of year 2001 (December 30) and at the beginning of the year 2002
(first half of January) a large outbreak of human trichinellosis has
occurred in [the former Yugoslavia. Clinical cases reported so far are
247. The centre of the epidemic was in Zrenjanin, a town 90 km northeast of
Belgrade, headquarters of North-Banat district of Autonomy Province
Vojvodina, Republic of Serbia. Apart from the Health Centre Zrenjanin, the
infected people were diagnosed in Novi Becej, Zitiste, Novi Sad, Belgrade
as well in
Niksic (Montenegro) and at a military campus in South Serbia where 15
soldiers were infected and diagnosed by the Military Medical Academy.
The source of the infection was "domestic smoked sausages" that were made,
produced and distributed by the owner of a small slaughterhouse in Kumane
(village close to Zrenjanin). The slaughterhouse slaughters up to 100 swine
per day and processes meat. The thermal processing of the products is
performed in a smoked chamber by heating wood, without control of
temperatures. The sausages contained pork, fat, and additives stuffed in
dry pork intestine.
Upon outbreak of trichinellosis, the infectivity of the sausages was
detected by enzymatic digestion in the Specialized Veterinary Institute in
Zrenjanin. This finding has been verified in the Institute for Meat
Technology and Hygiene, Belgrade, where 19 larvae of _Trichinella_ were
recovered per gram of sausages from the same lot. Further analysis of the
sausage from this lot was performed by enzymatic digestion in the Centre
for Experimental Parasitology, Royal Veterinary and Agricultural
University, Copenhagen, Denmark, where 23 larvae of _Trichinella_ per gram
were recovered. This Centre also performed species typing of the
_Trichinella_ isolated from the sausages by multiplex PCR and identified
the larvae as _Trichinella spiralis_.
In the slaughterhouse the pork had been inspected for _Trichinella_ by
enzymatic digestion performed by the owner's daughter, who had trained for
10 days at the Veterinary Faculty in Belgrade.
The artificial digestion method in use in this slaughterhouse has
subsequently been found to have several flaws. The sieve was more then 50
percent obstructed, and the sedimentation of the larvae was so poorly
performed that a very high percentage of larvae was probably lost. The
slaughterhouse owner is now being sued by the district attorney for the
marketing of pork not officially veterinary inspected for the production of
the sausages. The local state veterinary inspector is also being cited for
the neglect of professional responsibilities

[Trichinellosis is abundant in the former Yugoslavia, which is illustrated
by the outbreak in 1998 in France where horsemeat imported from Yugoslavia
was infected. A small outbreak was seen in 2000 among Yugoslav immigrants
in the UK who had imported pork meat from home to make sausage. It is most
probably a widespread problem that can only be solved by rigorous testing
of meat and tight import control of any kind of meat from the former
Yugoslavia. - Mod.EP
