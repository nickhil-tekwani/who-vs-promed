Re: Foot & mouth disease - Libya: OIE (regional response)
---------------------------------------------------------
Concerning FMD outbreaks in Libya, the laboratory confirmation of the FMD
virus SAT 2 was made by Pirbright on 16 Jun, 2003 and the epizootic was
declared to OIE on 18 Jun, 2003; Libya declared 6 foci in which more than
100 cattle have been stamped out. No cases were observed on sheep and goats
nor camels.
Sanitary Police measures were taken such as:
- animal transportation forbidden around foci and in the border area;
- disinfection of the infected premises following the stamping out;
- control of animal transportation in the unaffected areas.
We do not know yet if a vaccination campaign started in Libya but it seems
that the virus expansion is limited due to the exceptional high
temperatures and the dry climatic conditions, registered during June and
July in the region. The Libyan veterinary services acquired a good
experience of surveillance and control from the FMD outbreaks of December
1989 and from the New World screw-worm flies eradication project in 1988.
Concerning Tunisia, until now there is no notification of the virus
presence in the border area nor in the other districts of the country. The
following preventive measures were taken by ministerial ordinance No. 1217,
dated 19 Jun 2003; these measures have been communicated to OIE on 1 Jul 2003:
- border closure to all type of animals coming from Libya;
- disinfection of all vehicles coming from Libya, at the border;
- destruction of all type of food from animal origin coming from Libya;
- serological surveillance of animals which have entered from Libya during
the previous 3 months;
- extreme vigilance along the border by National Guards and army on the
Saharan border line;
- 5 millions doses of FMD SAT 2 vaccine and diagnostic kits were ordered as
soon as the information about FMD outbreak was known;
- vaccination of ruminants started on 28 Jul 2003, in the 6 districts of
the south part of Tunisia (which have been declared high vigilance area),
applying an inactivated, trivalent FMD vaccine including O, A and SAT 2 FMD
vaccine strains. The normal national annual FMD vaccination campaign, due
to start in September, will cover the entire country.
- organisation of information and awareness days in all the districts and
especially in those neighbouring Libya.
It seems thus that the problem is under control in Tunisia, all the
veterinary services are in state of alert, and the police, customs,
national guard and army services are also aware of the problem and will
react rapidly to any threat.
