The United Kingdom's Health Protection Agency (HPA) said that
Northwest England could soon see a measles epidemic, after an
outbreak in Cheshire resulted in 22 children ages one to 12 years
diagnosed with the disease. Seven of the cases have been confirmed in
laboratory tests; results for the remainder have not yet been
received.

Over the summer [2008], Trafford [Lancashire] saw 8 confirmed cases
of measles, and then another 89 were diagnosed in Blackpool,
Lancashire.

Dr. Sam Ghebrehewet, of the HPA Cheshire and Merseyside unit, said
measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination rates must increase. "It's
worrying that we potentially have 22 cases of measles in Cheshire,
and my fear is that we will see further outbreaks here and elsewhere
in the region," he said.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett

[In June 2008, the Health Protection Agency reported that due to
almost 10 years of sub-optimal MMR vaccination coverage across the
United Kingdom, the number of children susceptible to measles is now
sufficient to support the continuous spread of measles. 14 years
after the local transmission of measles was halted in the United
Kingdom, the disease has once again become endemic, and the 1st fatal
case since 2006 was recorded in May 2008.

The preceding report indicates that the measles is no longer
restricted predominantly to the greater London area but is now
spreading through the country. Greater awareness of the increasing
measles incidence by health professionals and the public is essential
to control the spread of infection. Health services should exploit
all possible opportunities to offer MMR vaccine to children of any
age who have not received 2 doses.

Other parts of Europe are similarly facing measles outbreaks, with
ongoing outbreaks in Switzerland, Austria and Italy, all as a
consequence of less than sufficient vaccine coverage. By contrast,
Portugal, which has been able to maintain a high level of vaccine
coverage, has remained free of measles virus infection for several
years (see: ProMED-mail post archive number 20081018.3302).
