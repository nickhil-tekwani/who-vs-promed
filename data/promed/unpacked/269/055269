Time and Place:
---------------
- Botulism has been a notifiable disease in France since 1986.

- 56 percent of outbreaks during 1993 to 1996 were ascribed to ham
products; 69 percent during 2001 to 2002.
- Annual botulism rates vary from 0.01 to 0.04 per 10 000, and are
similar to rates reported in surrounding countries - see graph:

Although it is stated that inhaled cocaine was linked to botulism, it
is more likely that the injection of the cocaine was the cause with
subsequent wound botulism. - Mod.LL]
