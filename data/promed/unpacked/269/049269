Butchers across Britain reported soaring demand for beef-on-the-bone today
despite fears that it may be linked with CJD. Customers were undeterred
from stocking up for Christmas, despite Agriculture Minister Jack
Cunningham's announcement that it was intended to make sale of bone-in beef
illegal on December 16, after a consultation period ending on December 12.
Joe Collier, owner of Eastwoods Butchers in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, was
quoted as saying, "Most people think the whole thing is ludicrous, and are
very angry about it, and say they want to go on eating beef on the bone.
We had extra beef ribs in yesterday from Scotland. We've got one set left
which I'm taking to a charity event tonight, to demonstrate cutting and
cooking, and we could have sold it over and over again. We've had 15 phone
calls during the day reserving beef-on-the-bone. It's part of the British
heritage, people think of roast beef as ribs of beef. I don't think the
ban will be allowed to happen, I think sheer public pressure will stop it."
Gordon Hepburn, national chairman of the Guild of Q Butchers, from
Mountnessing, Essex, was quoted as saying, "We've got orders next week for
oxtails and ribs - people want beef-on-the-bone, they're quite happy to
take them for Christmas. This is happening for no apparent reason, there's
no logic to it. If he's saying the bone is not right, I would suggest the
rest of the animal ought to be condemned as well.

BUTCHERS launched a nationwide appeal to their customers yesterday to sign
a petition urging the Government to abandon its proposed ban on beef on the
bone. They also want any ban postponed until after Christmas.
At the same time, local authority officials predicted a flourishing black
market in bone-in beef; they believe it will be virtually impossible to
stop the most sought-after cuts being sold under the counter.
The ban, announced by Jack Cunningham, the Minister of Agriculture, on
December 3, is to come into force next Tuesday.
Unless amended, it will outlaw such cuts as rib of beef, T-bone steak and
oxtail. Anyone caught selling such items will be guilty of an offence
punishable in a magistrates' court by a fine of up to Â£5,000 and/or up to
six months in jail; or up to two years' jail and/or an unlimited fine in a
Crown Court.
Since Dr Cunningham's announcement, customers keen to fill their freezers
before the ban takes effect have cleared butchers' shops of ribs of beef,
always popular in the run-up to Christmas, and oxtails.
David Statham, food committee chairman of the Chartered Institute of
Environmental Health, said: "As we understand it, butchers will still be
able to have beef hanging on the bone in their shops.
"An offence will only be committed if beef is actually sold to a customer
on the bone. Unless an inspector is present to witness such a transaction,
it is difficult to see how an offence could be proved."
Dr Cunningham took his decision after receiving the results of new research
by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, the scientific body
set up to advise the Government. This showed evidence of BSE ("mad cow"
disease) infectivity in dorsal root ganglia, nervous tissue in the bones of
the spinal column of cattle which is left with the bone when meat is cut
off the spine. Tests also found "provisional" evidence that bone marrow
might harbour the BSE agent.
The scientists estimated that no more than three out of the 2.2 million
cattle slaughtered for consumption next year might carry infection in their
dorsal root ganglia.

[I consulted a handy, nearby economist for an explanation of why people buy
more beef when the government bans it. The short explanation ran something
like the following: This anomalous situation really brings home the
significance of consumers' tastes and preferences on product demand. Lack
of education/information on food safety? Lack of government credibility?
For whatever reason, here is why we don't often see what we anticipate as a
shift in demand as it relates to a particular pathogen-product food scare.
