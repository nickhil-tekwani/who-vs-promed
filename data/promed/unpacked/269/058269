Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 5 Aug 2013
Report date: 29 Aug 2013
Date submitted to OIE: 29 Aug 2013
Date event resolved: 7 Aug 2013
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: Clinical infection
Causal agent: Chlamydophila psittaci_
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Singapore, Singapore
Date of start of the outbreak: 21 Jul 2013

Outbreak status: Resolved (7 Aug 2013)
Epidemiological unit: Not applicable
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 3 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0

Epidemiological unit: Not applicable
Affected animals: The sick Amazon parrot belonged to a private owner who kept 2 other birds, a macaw and a Lovebird.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 3 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost (removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter)
Birds / 33.33 percent / 33.33 percent /100 percent / 33.33 percent

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: The sick Amazon parrot died on 25 Jul 2013 despite receiving veterinary care. Surveillance was carried out at the owner's premises and all the in contact birds were clinically healthy. Faecal swabs were collected and tested negative for _Chlamydophila psittaci_ by PCR. As the bird was purchased a week ago, the pet shop which sold the bird was traced and surveillance carried out at the shop. None of the birds present showed clinical signs of avian chlamydiosis. Faecal swabs from the birds tested negative. Further investigations revealed that the bird was imported in June 2013.

Control measures
Measures applied: Screening, Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s), No vaccination, Treatment of affected animals (6-8 weeks treatment with suitable antibiotics)
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type: Animal and Plant Health Laboratory (national laboratory)

Species / Test / Test date / Result Birds / Nested RT-PCR / 5 Aug 2013/ Positive

Future reporting: The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[Avian chlamydiosis (AC) is caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. The disease in birds was originally called psittacosis, but the term ornithosis was introduced later to differentiate the disease in domestic and wild fowl from the disease in psittacine birds. The 2 syndromes are currently considered to be the same. Their earlier separation was based on the assumption that in humans, ornithosis was a milder disease than psittacosis. However, it should be noted that the disease in humans contracted from turkeys and ducks is often as severe as that contracted from psittacine birds.

Infection of birds with _Chlamydophila psittaci_ is common all over the world and has been found in about 465 avian species. Outbreaks of AC in psittacine birds and domestic poultry farms cause considerable economic damage. The infection can lead to systemic and occasionally fatal disease in birds. The clinical signs are generally nonspecific and vary greatly in severity, depending on the species and age of the bird and the strain of chlamydia. AC can produce lethargy, hyperthermia, abnormal excretions, nasal and eye discharges, and reduced egg production. Mortality rates will vary greatly.

In pet birds the most frequent clinical signs are conjunctivitis, anorexia and weight loss, diarrhoea, yellowish droppings, sinusitis, biliverdinuria, nasal discharge, sneezing, lachrymation and respiratory distress. Many birds, especially older psittacine birds, may show no clinical signs; nevertheless, they may often shed the agent for extended periods.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to OIE Terrestrial Manual 2012, Chapter 2.3.1 "Avian Chlamydiosis" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.01_AVIAN_CHLAMYD.pdf (version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2012). The review includes 44 references (omitted from the above cited text).

OIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to AC are spelled out in chapter 10.1 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.10.1.htm. According to Article 10.1.2, "Trade in commodities", Veterinary Authorities of countries free from avian chlamydiosis may prohibit importation or transit through their territory, from countries considered infected with avian chlamydiosis, of birds of the Psittacidae family. Article 10.1.3, "Recommendations for the importation of birds of the Psittacidae family", says that Veterinary Authorities of importing countries should require the presentation of an international veterinary certificate attesting that the birds:
1. showed no clinical sign of avian chlamydiosis on the day of shipment;
2. were kept under veterinary supervision for the 45 days prior to shipment and were treated against avian chlamydiosis using chlortetracycline.

There is at present no internationally agreed list of countries officially recognised as free from avian chlamydiosis.

Information on the AC situation in OIE's member countries, based upon their reports, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist. As subscribers may see, most countries have not specified surveillance for AC, some maintain "general surveillance" and very few maintain "targeted surveillance". During July-December 2012, demonstrated clinical AC disease was reported from 20 countries; the disease was "suspected" in 2 countries, and infection was present (with no clinical disease) in 5 countries.

_Chlamydophila psittaci_ is a long-known human pathogen.

Amazon parrot is the common name for a parrot of the genus _Amazona_. These are medium-sized parrots native to the New World ranging from South America, Mexico and the Caribbean (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_parrot). - Mod.CRD]

[With this report, ProMED welcomes Cristina Ramirez David, DVM, MS (Mod.CRD) as a new member of our veterinary team. Trained in Chile, and a veteran of numerous field veterinary projects in Latin America, she also served on the GLEWS team at OIE headquarters in Paris. She has now relocated to the US and will serve as ProMED Animal Health Liaison Moderator, monitoring reports from OIE and coordinating ProMED activities with OIE and other international animal health organizations. - Mod.LM]

[Amazon parrots are very popular but long lived, about 40 years, and therefore their placement is monitored carefully in some countries. In the US you do get inspected by the Amazon parrot owners before being allowed to have one. And because they are popular they are usually bred by the parrot people, not extracted from the Amazon basin, though that may still be possible. Thus in my mind this Singapore pet shop could well have bought it from a foreign breeder (it was "imported") as one of a batch of parrots (spreading the importation cost); and therefore there may well be other birds in Singapore (and also sold) that came with this parrot from the same source and would possibly present a risk.

Logically the Singapore Veterinary Authority is already following up on whatever leads that they have. - Mod.MHJ
