MEASLES - AUSTRALIA EX INDONESIA

This newspaper carried a report that there were 33 cases of measles in
Melbourne, with 13 requiring admission to hospital. Four of these cases
included 3 nurses and one doctor.
The article cites Dr Graham Rouch ,Victoria's Chief Health Officer as
believing that more cases are likely and he indicated the need for
immunization.
The same newspaper on 17 Mar 1999 indicated that this current outbreak
commenced with a person contracting the illness whilst in Bali [Indonesia]
who
returned to work in a cinema. Whilst originally occurring in Melbourne's
western suburbs it had now spread to a wider area.

[How ironic; Bali is a malaria-free tourist paradise in Indonesia, yet you
can go there & get measles -- which can be a serious disease in adults. The
moral is, when traveling to underdeveloped countries, be sure your childhood
vaccinations are up-to-date
