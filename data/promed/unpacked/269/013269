Comment on: Rabies - UK (02): ex Hungary, dog passport infringement, alert
Archive Number: 20121207.1442813
-------------------------------
The puppy monitored in this report -- imported from outside UK -- which was not used to her new owners, has slightly bitten (the dog gave a "small bite") one of the owners. The veterinarian raised cover about rabies (?), because the age of the puppy did not appear to match that on its passport (?), and because it was imported from Europe.

Was that enough reason not to observe the dog for the regular 3 weeks? (as all over in Europe) and see if the preventive immunization of the person bitten is still justified?? Besides, subsequent tests revealed the puppy had legally been vaccinated (which must have been indicated on its passport, but was not mentioned in this report).

Please allow me to comment that this story is raising unjustified suspect about rabid-suspect dogs from Hungary presenting a threat for UK citizens, and -- in case of bites -- driving them to hospitals to undergo post-exposure rabies injections.

In my opinion the age of the dog should be [have been] determined more closely, and in case of discrepancies between data of the passport and data yielded by the UK veterinarians the case should be clarified.

However the present interpretation of the story for the international professional readership in "PROMED-AHEAD" is giving an unjustified impression about possible danger of rabies-suspect dogs from Hungary and should somehow be corrected.

As a background information: The Institute where I am working (Institute for Veterinary Research of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest) has been the "Vaccine Production Institute" for Hungary, that started producing and legally distributing anti-rabies vaccines for dogs in 1924 (to my knowledge, this was 1st all over the word).

Control of vaccination efficiencies have also been taken very seriously by this Institute, led by late Prof Aladar Aujeszky, who discovered "Pseudorabies" [a herpes virus] (later called: Aujeszky's disease" in 1902). Due to compulsory vaccination of all dogs with this vaccine from 1933 in Hungary, dog rabies has been successfully eradicated from Hungary by the early 1960s. Sylvatic rabies (mainly in foxes) spreading from Western Europe towards the east has practically also been eradicated since.

[ProMED-mail thanks Bela Nagy for this interesting comment and for the information concerning vaccination of canines in in Hungary. However, the country of origin of the puppy was not the concern of the veterinarian in Islington, but rather the fact that that the documentation accompanying the animal did not correspond with its biological age. Unfortunately there have been other infringements recently when pet animals have passed through multipack veterinary controls without proper scrutiny of their documentation; see, for example "Rabies - Netherlands (03): (Amsterdam) canine ex Morocco, ProMED-mail Archive Number: 20120310.1066836".

Although canine rabies is well-controlled in Hungary, rabies is still present in wildlife. The position of the UK is particularly sensitive being a rabies-free island (except for rare isolations of bat rabies). In fact rabies virus was eradicated from the UK early in the 20th century, without the use of vaccine. - Mod.CP
