The Health Department has detected 8 cases of legionellosis in Alcoy (Alicante), that have occurred over the last 10 days, and "their coincidence in space and in time makes this an outbreak," according to a press release from the department.

Of the 8 affected persons, 6 required hospitalization, 2 of whom have been discharged, and the remaining 4 are still in the hospital. According to the same sources, "all the hospitalized patients are doing well."

The Health Department is currently working in order to determine the likely source, by inspecting and taking samples from the facilities considered to be at risk. Also, chlorine concentrations in the water supply network have been determined, and found to be "stable and within the normal range", according to the same press release.
