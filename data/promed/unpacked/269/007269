[1] Vaccine requirement

A US judge upheld the University of California's COVID-19 vaccine requirement against a challenge by a professor who alleged he had immunity due to a prior coronavirus infection, in what appears to be the first ruling on the issue. US District Court Judge James Selna in Santa Ana, California, said the university system acted rationally to protect public health by mandating the vaccine and not exempting individuals with some level of immunity from an infection.

More than 43 million Americans have had confirmed cases of COVID-19 and some opponents of vaccinations have argued that immunity from an infection negates the need for an inoculation. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on [6 Aug 2021] that a study showed vaccines offer better protection than natural immunity gained from prior infection, which wanes over time.

On [Wed 29 Sep 2021], a group of physicians who are Republican members of Congress wrote to CDC to urge the agency to acknowledge natural immunity. They said if the growing number of vaccine mandates ignore natural immunity it could lead to labor shortages as people are fired for failing to get a shot. Their letter said such mandates could even trigger a security crisis because up to 20% of the military faces "separation" and many of them "likely have natural immunity".

Selna's ruling denied a motion for a preliminary injunction by Aaron Kheriaty (professor of psychiatry and human behavior at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine). Selna said the professor was unlikely to succeed, but Kheriaty said he plans to continue the litigation. He told Reuters he plans to use the discovery process to determine how the policy was formulated and to question the university's expert witnesses about their reasoning for rejecting his arguments on natural immunity.

[If rapid antibody tests were available for point of care use, then previously infected individuals who are not vaccinated could show proof of immunity. Even though it has been demonstrated that the vaccine boosts immunity following prior infection, and is recommended, such proof of existing immunity might be a possible compromise. - Mod.LK]

ref: Townsend JP, Hassler HB, Wang Z et al. The durability of immunity against reinfection by SARS-CoV-2: a comparative evolutionary study. Lancet Microbe 2021 Published Online 1 Oct 2021 https://doi.org/10.1016/ S2666-5247(21)00219-6.

Summary
Background: Among the most consequential unknowns of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic are the durability of immunity and time to likely reinfection. There are limited direct data on SARS-CoV-2 long-term immune responses and reinfection. The aim of this study is to use data on the durability of immunity among evolutionarily close coronavirus relatives of SARS-CoV-2 to estimate times to reinfection by a comparative evolutionary analysis of related viruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-NL63.

Methods: We conducted phylogenetic analyses of the S, M, and ORF1b genes to reconstruct a maximum-likelihood molecular phylogeny of human-infecting coronaviruses. This phylogeny enabled comparative analyses of peak-normalised nucleocapsid protein, spike protein, and whole-virus lysate IgG antibody optical density levels, in conjunction with reinfection data on endemic human-infecting coronaviruses. We performed ancestral and descendent states analyses to estimate the expected declines in antibody levels over time, the probabilities of reinfection based on antibody level, and the anticipated times to reinfection after recovery under conditions of endemic transmission for SARS-CoV-2, as well as the other human-infecting coronaviruses.

Findings: We obtained antibody optical density data for 6 human-infecting coronaviruses, extending from 128 days to 28 years after infection between 1984 and 2020. These data provided a means to estimate profiles of the typical antibody decline and probabilities of reinfection over time under endemic conditions. Reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 under endemic conditions would likely occur between 3 months and 5.1 years after peak antibody response, with a median of 16 months. This protection is less than half the duration revealed for the endemic coronaviruses circulating among humans (5-95% quantiles 15 months to 10 years for HCoV-OC43, 31 months to 12 years for HCoV-NL63, and 16 months to 12 years for HCoV-229E). For SARS-CoV, the 5-95% quantiles were 4 months to 6 years, whereas the 95% quantiles for MERS-CoV were inconsistent by dataset.

Interpretation: The timeframe for reinfection is fundamental to numerous aspects of public health decision making. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, reinfection is likely to become increasingly common. Maintaining public health measures that curb transmission--including among individuals who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2--coupled with persistent efforts to accelerate vaccination worldwide is critical to the prevention of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

Added value of this study: We provide the first estimates of the expected probability of infection given IgG antibody levels to the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the endemic coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-NL63, under endemic conditions. Characterizing the typical waning profile over time for IgG antibody levels to the spike protein, nucleocapsid protein, and to whole viral lysate, we derive the corresponding probabilities of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection that provide a timeframe crucial to numerous aspects of public health decision making.

Implications of all the available evidence: Reports of eventual reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 are mounting, but they have not reached proportions within well surveilled cohorts that would enable a quantitative epidemiological study. As a pioneering estimate, our findings are consistent with the mounting reports of eventual reinfection by SARS-CoV-2, and indicate that reinfection after natural recovery from COVID-19 will become increasingly common as the pandemic progresses.

When more data become available on antibody declines following vaccination, our approach could be extended to assess which vaccines provide longer immunity than natural infection and stronger protection against emerging variants.

[3] Israel: impact of booster dose
Date: Sun 3 Oct 2021 7:05 PM
Source: Times of Israel [edited]
https://www.timesofisrael.com/life-saver-boosters-cut-elderlys-risk-of-covid-death-to-50th-of-unvaxxed-rate/


'Dramatic figures' show over-60s who shun vaccines are not only at much greater risk of death than triple-vaxxed, but also have 65 times the chance of getting seriously ill. After boosters, elderly Israelis who are fully inoculated have just one 50th of the chance of COVID death compared with unvaccinated people in the same age bracket.

According to Health Ministry data for the last 7 days of September [2021], there were 6.43 daily deaths per 100 000 Israelis aged 60-plus. For older people who were vaccinated 3 times, the average was 0.13. The statistics indicate that the shift from a 2-shot to a 3-shot regime has saved many lives. When elderly Israelis who are vaccinated twice get their 3rd shot, they eliminate 11-twelfths of the risk of death.

The daily death rate in the last 7 days of September [2021] for the double vaccinated elderly was 1.5 per 100 000, compared with 0.13/100 000 for the triple vaccinated.

"These are dramatic figures," Professor Ehud Grossman of Tel Aviv University's medicine faculty told The Times of Israel. "They show clearly that the decrease in the current wave is due to vaccination, and point to the effectiveness of inoculation." Noting that there is also a big margin in serious cases between the vaccinated and unvaccinated, he said that the figures highlight the extent to which the continued refusal of around 900 000 eligible Israelis is accentuating the impact of the virus. "You can deduce that if we were all vaccinated there would be very low severe cases and deaths," he said.

The statistics show that older people who don't vaccinate increase their chances of getting seriously ill with COVID-19 by 65 times. Among triple-vaccinated Israelis aged 60-plus, there are 2.6 people per 100 000 in serious condition. Among the unvaccinated the figure is 168.5/100 000. Boosters are shown to be working well in keeping people out of serious condition. There are 28.5 serious cases per 100 000 people among 60-plus Israelis who got just 2 shots, compared to 2.6 for the triple-vaccinated.

The number of coronavirus patients being treated on ventilators rose above 200 for the 1st time since late March [2021] in late September [2021], and is now at 205. In total, there are 588 patients in a serious condition.

The Health Ministry statistics point to increased risk of serious illness among younger people who don't vaccinate, as well as the elderly. Among under-60s, 6.4 people per 100 000 are currently in a serious condition with the coronavirus, compared with just 0.2 among those who were vaccinated 3 times and 1.4 among those who were vaccinated twice.

Professor Eyal Leshem, infectious diseases specialist at Sheba Medical Center, told The Times of Israel that there is one limitation to the figures, namely that they assume that vaccinated and unvaccinated people have the same level of exposure to coronavirus and have a similar level of health, which may or may not be the case. But he said that the margins are so high that the picture painted by the figures is clear. "What we see is that among the triple-vaccinated, rates of severe disease and death are very low, and it is this that's allowing the country to function without being in lockdown," said Leshem. "That's what's allowing us to weather the current storm of illness. And these numbers tell people who are still unvaccinated that when there are thousands of cases each day they are still at high risk of severe disease and deaths."

With around 900 000 Israelis still unvaccinated, Leshem said that the figures suggest just how different life may be if most of them were to accept shots. "If the 30-plus were all vaccinated, we would probably be able to live a very normal life," he suggested. "And while there would still be some transmission there would be very few restrictions."

[In the past 24 hours, 8 countries -- the UK (30 165), Turkey (27 351), the USA (26 933), Russia (25 769), India (21 684), Philippines (13 166), Iran (12 428), and Thailand (10 828) -- have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 4330 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 1 Oct 2021 to late 2 Oct 2021). A total of 51 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 26 of the 51 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 6.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 5.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show 17.5% decrease in daily reported cases and 6.8% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: Worldwide over 300 000 newly confirmed infections were reported in the past 24 hours; cumulative totals of over 235.71 million cases and over 4.81 million deaths have been reported. - Mod.UBA
