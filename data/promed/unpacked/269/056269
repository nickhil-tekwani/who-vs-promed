The Zooprophilactic Institute of Teramo, national reference center
for exotic diseases, confirmed West Nile virus infection in horses of
some stables located in the province of Ferrara. The Institute
confirmed the presence of infection in wild birds from the same
province, examined under the regional plan for wildlife monitoring.

West Nile is an infectious disease [and this virus is] transmitted by
mosquitoes, particularly the _Culex_ genus. The virus is maintained
in the environment through the continuous passage between mosquitoes
and wild birds, which can also cause a significant mortality, and can
occasionally be transmitted to different animals and to humans.

Typically in mammals the infection is asymptomatic, however, in
horses clinical neurological symptoms can occur sometimes. West Nile
virus is responsible for clinical disease in humans in a very small
percentage of cases.

Both in humans and horses, however, the duration and amount of virus
in the blood are not sufficient to cause further infections [serve as
sources of infectious blood meals for vector mosquitoes. - Mod.TY].
Indeed humans, as well as horses are dead-end hosts and the mosquito
can not in any way transmit the disease from person to person, from
horse to horse, or from horse to person.

In people, West Nile virus infection is very often asymptomatic (over
80 percent of cases) or with mild nonspecific symptoms. In rare cases
(less than 1 percent), especially in elderly or immunodeficient
individuals, the most serious neurological (encephalitis or
meningoencephalitis) disease may develop.

Horses play an important role as an indicator of the presence of the
virus in the territory, since they may show symptoms of infection.

While continuing their investigations on the presence of the virus in
Ferrara, the regional and local health centres, particularly those of
Ferrara, have already put in place a systematic monitoring programme
to further knowledge about the extent and scale of the phenomenon.

The programme was defined in collaboration with the Experimental
Zooprophilactic Institute of Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna, the Teramo
Reference Center, and the Ministry of Health.

The 1st measures given the local health centre relate to veterinary
supervision of horses and wild birds and human surveillance,
particularly of workers in the stables where there were horse cases,
and all suspected cases of viral encephalitis or meningoencephalitis
observed in the region.

Laboratory tests are carried out by the regional reference centre for
microbiological emergencies (CRREM), the Polyclinic S.
Orsola-Malpighi of Bologna. To date, there have been no reported
cases of human West Nile virus infection.

In addition to surveillance measures, veterinary and human
interventions are already programmed to monitor and fight the
mosquito vector. _Culex_ mosquitoes are abundantly present in rural
areas and have predominantly nocturnal habits.

In particular, in areas affected by the ongoing [West Nile virus]
phenomenon, in addition to what has already been implemented in
recent months under the regional plan to combat the Asian tiger
mosquito [_Aedes albopictus_] for the prevention of chikungunya and
dengue fever [virus transmission], interventions are planned for this
pest with adulticides during public events (festivals, fairs, and the
like) that are taking place in open areas, especially outside the
urban centres and in the presence of vegetation or in the vicinity of
courses or collections of water.

Entomological surveillance has been activated, providing for the
capture of mosquito samples taken for analysis for the detection of
the virus. Attention is called to the importance of adopting measures
to protect individuals from mosquito bites; this is the most
effective means to reduce the risk of contracting the virus.

West Nile virus (WNV) outbreaks with equine morbidity and mortality
sporadically occur in the Mediterranean Basin, so this outbreak is
not surprising. ProMED-mail requests further information should
additional cases occur and for the species of birds in which WNV has
been found in the current outbreak in Ferrara.
