Since [Tue 1 Aug 2017], the Kentucky Department for Public Health (DPH) has identified 1276 cases of acute hepatitis A, a liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. An increase in cases since [Tue 1 Aug 2017], primarily among the homeless and drug users, prompted declaration of a statewide outbreak in November 2017. Viral sequencing has linked several outbreak-associated cases in Kentucky with outbreaks in California and Utah.

The DPH is working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health departments to provide guidance and education to health professionals and at-risk populations. Treatment for acute hepatitis A generally involves supportive care, with specific complications treated as appropriate. Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease.

Counts as of 28 Jul 2018:
- Total outbreak [cases]: 1276
- Hospitalizations: 722
- Deaths: 8

In a follow-up on the hepatitis A outbreak in northeastern Arkansas, state health officials have now reported 77 cases since February 2008, more than double the number of cases reported in mid-June 2018. Greene County has seen the most cases, followed by Clay and Craighead counties.

The Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) says the hepatitis A vaccine (hep A) is safe and effective. Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis A virus, which is a different virus from the viruses that cause hepatitis B or hepatitis C. It is usually spread when a person ingests tiny amounts of fecal matter from contact with objects, food or drinks contaminated by the feces, or stool, of an infected person.

Risk factors for getting hepatitis A include close contact with someone who has hepatitis A, being a food worker, illicit drug use, homelessness, or incarceration. Risk factors for having more severe symptoms of hepatitis A include having other infections or chronic diseases like hepatitis B or C, HIV/AIDS, or diabetes.
