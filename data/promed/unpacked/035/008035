----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Haitian strain is not an example of the Matlab variant. I am a strong proponent of the Mutreja (2011, Nature) assessment of cholera dissemination, in particular since I have examined so much of the data myself.

El Tor cholera emerged in the late 1950s and then spread globally through the early 1990s. In my paper, I refer to this as "typical" El Tor.

The Matlab variant arose out of the El Tor lineage in the early 1990s with one major distinction. The strains have the cholera toxin phage on chromosome 2 instead of chromosome 1. The ctxB gene in those strains is similar to the classical ctxB gene (ctxB1 allele) and has undergone some minor changes as well during expansion (ctxB alleles 4-6). In my paper, I refer to these in the supplemental table as "atypical" El Tor.

The "altered" El Tor arose in the late 1990s and have overtaken as the major cause of cholera worldwide. These strains emerged from the typical El Tor since they have the Ctx phage on chromosome 1 but it has 2 point mutations in the El Tor ctxB similar to the classical-like ctxB1 allele. These are NOT descendants of the Matlab strains clearly evidenced by the different chromosomal location of the ctx genes.

The altered El Tor were first found in Bangladesh in the late 1990s and spread globally. Early isolates have an active MARTX toxin gene identical to typical El Tor. This strain still causes disease and was one of 2 strains that were circulating in Nepal in 2010.

The null mutation in rtxA arose sometime around 2002 and this strain has spread globally to Africa, East Asia, and Russia. Around 2007 it acquired another point mutation in the ctxB gene (the ctxB7 allele) that is a key marker for the strain that ultimately arrived in Haiti. This is a very small cluster of strains isolated in India in 2007, Bangladesh in 2009 and Cameroon and Nepal in 2010. This is the strain transmitted to Haiti.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Satchell for clarifying the genetic differences in _V. cholerae_ El Tor variants, highlighting the Haitian epidemic strain.

Her most recent paper, highlighted in a recent ProMED posting, which she refers to in her comments is: Dolores J, Satchell KJF: Analysis of _Vibrio cholerae_ genome sequences reveals unique rtxA variants in environmental strains and an rtxA-null mutation in recent altered El Tor isolates 4:2. mBio 2013; 4(2); doi: 10.1128/mBio.00624-12; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3634609/. - Mod.LL
