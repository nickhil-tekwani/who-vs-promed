In December 2006, the Orange County Health Care Agency (OCHCA) and
the California Department of Health Services (CDHS) were notified of
2 potential cases of foodborne botulism in an older Asian couple.
This report summarizes the subsequent investigation, which identified
home-prepared fermented tofu (soybean curd) as the source. The public
should be aware of the risk for botulism when preparing fermented tofu at home.
Botulism is a toxin-induced paralytic illness characterized by
cranial nerve palsies and descending flaccid paralysis. Treatment is
based on supportive care and administration of botulinum antitoxin;
recovery can take from weeks to months. Foodborne botulism results
from eating foods containing botulinum toxin (1). Although rare,
foodborne botulism is a public health emergency because of the
potential severity of illness and exposure of many persons to
contaminated food.
On Tue 28 Nov 2006, a 67-year-old woman had onset of double vision,
followed the next day by bilateral ptosis [drooping of the upper
eyelid]. An ophthalmologist attributed these symptoms to
long-standing diabetes mellitus. On Mon 4 Dec 2006, she visited her
primary-care physician because of double vision, ptosis, dizziness,
difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, drooling, and right arm
weakness. Physical examination revealed limitation of upward gaze,
bilateral ptosis, sluggish tongue movement, and mild right upper
extremity weakness.
The woman's husband, aged 75 years, reported 3 days of worsening
double vision, dizziness, and difficulty swallowing. On physical
examination, he also had mild right ptosis and sluggish tongue movement.
Both patients were admitted to an intensive care unit. On Tue 5 Dec
2006, physicians suspected foodborne botulism, notified OCHCA, and
collected clinical specimens for testing. CDHS dispatched botulinum
antitoxin to the hospital, and it was administered to the couple.
Both patients were hospitalized for more than one week with no
further symptom progression. Botulinum toxin was not detected in
serum or stool samples from the patients. However, _Clostridium
botulinum_ type A was detected in enrichment cultures of the stool
samples of both patients. Both patients have some blurred vision but
otherwise have recovered.
On Tue 5 Dec 2006, OCHCA visited the couple's home and identified
multiple potential sources of intoxication. OCHCA interviewed the
patients using photos of home-prepared food items to overcome the
language barrier and identify the most suspect food. The patients
reported they recently had been eating a new batch of home-prepared
fermented tofu. Although both had eaten fermented tofu from this
batch every day, the woman ate more than her husband. CDHS Microbial
Diseases Laboratory found both _C. botulinum_ type A and botulinum
toxin type A in the fermented tofu samples, which had a pH of 6.8.
The tofu was a commercially packaged product purchased at a retail
market. In the home, the tofu was boiled, towel dried, and cut into
cubes. The cubes were placed in a bowl, covered with plastic wrap,
and stored at room temperature for 10-15 days. The tofu was then
transferred to glass jars with chili powder, salt, white cooking
wine, vegetable oil, and chicken bouillon to marinate at room
temperature for 2-3 more days. Finally, the fermented tofu was stored
and eaten at room temperature.
_C. botulinum_ spores exist widely in the environment, but proper
food-preparation practices inhibit spore germination and toxin
production (2). Environmental conditions that facilitate spore
germination and growth include a pH greater than 4.6, anaerobic
conditions, low salt or sugar content, and temperatures greater than
39.2 deg F (greater than 4 deg C) (2). In the case described in this
report, the growth of _C. botulinum_ and production of toxin might
have been facilitated by several factors: 1) the almost neutral pH of
the fermented tofu, 2) boiling the tofu, potentially creating an
anaerobic environment, and 3) room temperature (approximately 68-77
deg F [20-25 deg C]) storage of the product for days during and after
preparation.
The woman reported she has lived in the USA for more than 25 years
and, during this time, has prepared fermented tofu using the same
recipe she learned as a student in Taiwan. Preparation of this batch
was not notably different, and the reason for contamination this time
is not clear.
This is the first American report of botulism caused by eating
home-prepared fermented tofu. Historically, most foodborne botulism
cases in the USA result from consumption of improperly prepared
home-canned foods (1). However, fermented foods, including fish,
seal, and whale, also have been associated with botulism. Fermented
tofu is popular in Asia, and homemade fermented bean products,
including tofu, are the most common foods causing botulism in China.
During 1958-1989, home-fermented bean products were associated with
63 percent of approximately 2000 cases of botulism in China (3).
Clinicians, public health workers, and the public should be advised
that home preparation of fermented tofu can result in foodborne botulism.
