A rare disease suspected to be 'scrub typhus' has claimed 30 lives in Alwar district of Rajasthan this season. Another 6 have died due to a disease with similar symptoms in Dausa.

Concerned over the high death count recorded since 22 Aug this year [2012], the health department has sought the help of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) based in New Delhi. A team has reached the spot to collect blood samples, according to official sources.

Scrub typhus can be cured but only if it is timely diagnosed. It is caused by the bite of mites especially during the monsoon season and is reported in areas close to jungles or urban shrubs. Since fever is one of the early symptoms of this disease, wrong or delayed diagnosis is a major worry.

Residents claim that the death toll is over 50, but the chief medical health officer (CMHO) in Alwar, Dr K K Meena, puts the official figure at 30.

In Dausa, 6 people died recently after showing symptoms similar to that of scrub typhus, which include high fever and low platelet count. "In the initial investigation, we have found that some of them had low platelet count accompanied by fever," said Dr O P Bairwa, CMHO, Dausa.

"Scrub typhus is a zoonotic illness caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_. The pathogen is transmitted through the bite of larval mites (chiggers) of the _Trombiculidae_ family, which serve as both the vector and the reservoir (1,2). Rodents of the family _Muridae_ (rats and mice) are common hosts for trombiculid mites and may support _O. tsutsugamushi_. Geographically specific foci of scrub typhus are thus determined by the distribution of vector mites and their rodent hosts and by interactions of mites and rodents with humans (3). Scrub typhus has been reported from many regions of Asia and the Pacific islands, and known disease-endemic regions extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan (4,5).

"Scrub typhus is typically a nonspecific febrile illness; its severity may be influenced by the strain of _O. tsutsugamushi_, a person's immune status, and other factors. Diagnosis may be complicated in areas where the disease has not been documented recently or in regions lacking the capacity for laboratory confirmation. Illness develops after an incubation period of 6 to 21 days and usually begins with an eschar at the site of a chigger bite. Fever, headache, [lymphadenopathy], and myalgias are common, and a maculopapular rash may also be present. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or lower respiratory symptoms can also occur. Manifestations such as pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis can develop during the prolonged clinical course of untreated illness (6). Establishing the diagnosis and initiating prompt antimicrobial drug therapy are important, because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent (5). Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline, and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation.

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm). Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Patients with severe scrub typhus can develop multiorgan failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with hemorrhage.

Rajasthan is India's largest state located in northwestern India; it is bordered by Pakistan to the west. Alwar district has a population of 3 671 999 (2011 census) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alwar_District), and the adjacent Dausa District has a population of 1 316 790 (2001 census) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dausa_district).
