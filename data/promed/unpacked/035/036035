Dozens of students from La Sagesse school in Beirut were absent on Thu 30 Mar 2017 due to food poisoning inside the school, the school reported on 31 Mar 2017.

"On Thu 30 Mar 2017, about 40 students from the small sections were absent. It turned out that some of the absent students were suffering from diarrhea and vomiting, prompting the school to open an investigation," reported the communique of La Sagesse, which consulted the Ministry of Health on this subject and solicited its cooperation.

"The number of people who consumed the food served by the establishment amounts to 360, including pupils and teachers. Only the aforementioned suffered from the [health] disorders," added La Sagesse, without providing an exact figure concerning the sufferers.

"While waiting for the results of the tests, a number of pupils who have been absent have meanwhile returned to school on Friday [31 Mar 2017]," the school said.
