[2] Africa: Tanzania (Dar es Salaam)
Date: 1 Feb 2014.
From: Belia Klaassen <bklaassen@istclinic.com> [edited]


This message is to make sure ProMED-mail is informed of increasing cases of dengue fever in Dar es Salaam city, Tanzania. In our private clinic, IST Medical Scheme clinic, at least 10 proven cases (with rapid antigen/antibody test kits) have been diagnosed, starting halfway through December 2013 and increasingly so in the last 2 weeks. Most of these patients are expatriate residents in Dar es Salaam. Some needed hospitalisation because of gastritis and vomiting; 2 cases had very low platelets but are recovering.

The Tanzanian ministry of health has been informed and is assisting in serological testing.

In 2010, over 60 cases had been seen in our clinic as well; before 2010, cases were only sporadically diagnosed in Tanzania.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Belia Klaassen for sending in this firsthand report. We especially appreciate receiving dengue reports from Africa, since information coming from there is scarce.
