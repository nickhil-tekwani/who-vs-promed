Emergency prevention against wheat disease urged
------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture revealed on Thursday that 2 million hectares of
wheat in China have been plagued by stripe rust and the infected acreage
might reach 6.7 million hectares by the end of 2004. Minister Du Qinglin
urged local governments to strengthen the early-warning system and to
enhance efficiency in preventing and controlling the disease, hoping to
restrain the infected areas within 5 per cent of the total wheat yield. The
ministry set the wheat production goal for the summer of 2004 at an average
rise of 5 kilograms per mu (0.067 hectare) over the same period of 2003.
Du stressed that both governments and farmers should improve defensive
abilities against other disasters, such as drought, plant lodging [the
bending or falling over of a crop plant], and hot wind. He also reminded
farmers to focus on irrigation to ensure a sufficient water supply for
wheat, which was now at its key growth period for the year.

[Wheat stripe rust (also known as yellow rust) is caused by _Puccinia
striiformis_. It occurs worldwide at higher altitudes in wheat production
zones of the southern and northern areas of temperate regions. Yield losses
can be considerable, ranging from about 40 per cent to complete destruction
of the crop. Survival of the fungus is threatened by high temperature and
dry weather. It survives primarily in dormant mycelium and uredinia on
infected volunteer wheat. It also infects some barley cultivars. Disease
management involves the use of resistant cultivars, control of seeding
dates, elimination of volunteer seedlings and use of chemical fungicides.
