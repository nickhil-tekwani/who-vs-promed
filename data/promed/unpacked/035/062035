Samples collected yesterday [8 Aug 2017] from the 3 surviving suspects in the Luwero VHF [viral hemorrhagic fever] alert have tested negative by PCR for all Ebola, Marburg, CCHF [Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever], RVF [Rift Valley Fever], and Sosuga viruses at UVRI [Uganda Virus Research Institute].

The district is already aware of these preliminary findings. Testing is underway for the one sample collected from the deceased case.
