New outbreak of hepatitis A in Chihuahua state
----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health, of the state government of Chihuahua, has
reported a new outbreak of hepatitis A in the state. There are 40
suspected cases in the town of Hidalgo del Parral, the majority of
whom are in educational institutions, so a coordinated operation has
been implemented in order to prevent the disease from spreading out of
the colonies [neighborhoods/housing developments] where they are
localized.

Outbreaks have occurred in children 5 to 14 years of age in the Heroes
de la Revolucion, Zapata, PRI, Che Guevara, and Almansena colonies,
where 40 cases have been detected, a number that the state agency said
will be modified according to the progress of the work in identifying
affected individuals.

The state agency noted that in Parral, as in Guerrero, they have been
working in order to determine the cause of the outbreak
[?investigations to identify the index case and the route/vehicle of
transmission - Mod.MPP] but so far they have not identified the focus
of infection.

The state agency reported that they are currently compiling
information from different health institutions to determine the number
of people with this disease [hepatitis A].

Likewise, they stressed that the health sector is currently working in
coordination with the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport, Civil
Protection, SEDENA (National Defense Secretariat), and the Municipal
Presidency in order to implement preventive measures.

Among these practices is a focus on school hygiene, food handlers and
sanitation in the facility [school] such as the washing of water
tanks, rooms and drinking fountains.

Coespris [the State Commission for the Protection Against Sanitary
Risks] asserted that it constantly performs chlorine measurements in
the water supply for human consumption and in educational
institutions, being within the norm.

In addition, community officials go to homes of suspected cases to
check on their health status and report on hygienic measures of these
households.

[Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV).
The virus is spread when an uninfected (or unvaccinated) person eats
or drinks something contaminated by the stool of an HAV-infected
person: this is called faecal-oral transmission. The disease is
closely associated with inadequate sanitation and poor personal
hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not
cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause
debilitating symptoms. Hepatitis A occurs sporadically and in
epidemics worldwide, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences.
Worldwide, HAV infections account for an estimated 1.4 million cases
annually.

The symptoms of hepatitis A range from mild to severe, and can include
fever, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal
discomfort, dark-colored urine and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin
and whites of the eyes). Not everyone who is infected will have all of
the symptoms. Adults have signs and symptoms of illness more often
than children, and the severity of disease and mortality increases in
older age groups. Infected children under six years of age do not
usually experience noticeable symptoms, and only 10 percent develop
jaundice. Among older children and adults, infection usually causes
more severe symptoms, with jaundice occurring in more than 70 percent
of cases. Most people recover in several weeks -- or sometimes months
-- without complications. For more information see the WHO fact sheet
at: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs328/en/index.html.

Recent information concerning the incidence of hepatitis A virus
infection in Mexico can be found in the document:
Patterns of illness in travelers visiting Mexico and Central America:
the GeoSentinel experience. GeoSentinel Surveillance Network. Clin
Infect Dis. 2011 Sep;53(6):523-31. Epub 2011 Aug 10.

There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. Recovery from symptoms
following infection may be slow and take several weeks or months.
Therapy is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional
balance, including replacement of fluids that are lost from vomiting
and diarrhoea. Hepatitis A virus infection is now preventable by
vaccination.
