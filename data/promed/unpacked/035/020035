Eastern Cape Cholera Death Toll Rises to 8
---------------------------------------------
The death toll from a cholera outbreak in the former Transkei area of the
Eastern Cape has risen to 8, the provincial health department said on Mon
afternoon, 6 Jan 2003. The latest victim of the disease died at home in
Umtata on Sun night, 5 Jan 2003, said spokesman Sizwe Kupelo.
A total of 76 people were being treated for cholera symptoms at the Umtata
General Hospital.
Kupelo said villagers reported on 5 Jan 2003 the deaths of 4 members of a
family from the village of Baziya near Umtata. 2 other people died over
the weekend at the village of Buhlungwana in the Libode area. The 7th
victim was from Gxulu. The first cholera case was recorded at Ngcongane
near Umtata on 23 Dec 2002, after a group of people returned from a
traditional feast in Port St Johns.
Government investigations led to the testing of the Ndwalane River in Port
St Johns, which proved to be carrying the disease. It is presumed the
infection was due to an influx of people in the area over the festive
season, coupled with poor sanitation.
The villages worst affected by the outbreak were Baziya, Buhlungwana, and
Caguba in the vicinity of Port St Johns. They all fall under the OR Tambo
district municipality.
The provincial government would make ZAR1 million [USD 117 647] available
to the municipality on Monday for emergency sanitation, Kupelo said. Each
of the 3 villages would get ZAR300 000 [USD 35 294] for temporary toilets,
while the other ZAR100 000 [USD 11 765] would be used to provide clean
water for all affected areas.
Tents had been sent to each village for use as make-shift clinics, and
nurses were deployed to all affected areas, Kupelo said.
The provincial health department in KwaZulu-Natal meanwhile, reported that
9 people were currently being treated for cholera in that province. 5 of
these cases had been reported to the authorities during the past 3 days.
Some 290 people have died from the disease in KwaZulu-Natal since August 2000.

East Cape Cholera Outbreak Seems to Be Abating
----------------------------------------------
The cholera outbreak in the Eastern Cape which has claimed 8 lives since
the weekend, seemed to be abating by Tue 7 Jan 2003, officials said. 6
people remained hospitalized, with only 2 new patients admitted throughout
the day, the Umtata General Hospital said.
Physician Dr Mkhuseli Mashiyi said about 48 cholera patients had been
treated since Sun, 5 Jan 2003. Of these, only 4 remained in the hospital by
Tue [7 Jan 2003] afternoon, along with 2 new admissions who have not yet
tested positive for the disease. All the patients were stable, he said.
Provincial health department spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said no new cholera
cases were reported in Baziya or Caguba, 2 of the 3 villages most affected
by the disease. In the village of Buhlungwana, 6 people sought treatment
for cholera symptoms through the day.

Kampala Bans Local Bottled Drinks Following Cholera Outbreak
--------------------------------
Uganda's ministry of health has issued a cholera warning and banned the
sale of locally produced soft drinks and bottled water after traces of
feces [presumably high coliform bacterial counts - Mod.LL] were found in
tested samples.
The ministry together with the Kampala city council conducted the tests
into locally packed juices and water after about 100 cholera cases were
reported in the city and at least 2 people died.
In a joint press statement last week the ministry and council said the city
was a high-risk zone because sewerage had overflowed into wetlands and some
protected springs in the area. It added that in some cases toilets emptied
into open drainage channels. The ministry warned that water collected from
springs should be boiled before use and ordered that all sewerage drains
be covered.

week of 2002 (Week ending 22 Dec 2002) [edited]

This is the summary of the epidemiological situation in the country as
reported by 66 percent (37/56) of the districts. Christmas festivities
affected the level of reporting by districts and within districts.
Kampala continued to record more cholera cases from different parts of the
city. The numbers of cholera cases and deaths recorded this week are as
follows: Kampala (19 cases), Bundibugyo (6 cases), Kasese (5 cases), Nebbi
(2 cases), and Arua (2 cases). Community sensitization on prevention of
cholera should be stepped up in all districts to prevent further spread of
the epidemic.
Dysentery was recorded in 37 districts out of the 39 that submitted reports
this week. The leading districts in dysentery case reporting were: Moroto
(51), Yumbe (49), Bundibugyo (43), Kumi (41), Nebbi (39), Hoima (36),
Tororo (33), Wakiso (26 with 1 death), Kalangala (25), and Kisoro (25). The
District Health Teams are urged to work with the district political leaders
in the improvement of sanitation practices.

Cholera On the Rise
-------------------
9 patients have been admitted to the Cholera Treatment Centre at Mulago
Hospital as the epidemic continues to spread across Kampala. This is the
highest number of patients to be admitted to the centre since 2003 began.
Dr. Byarugaba Baterana, the in-charge of the centre, yesterday said the
number of cholera cases rose to 9 on Tue 7 Jan 2003. He said the epidemic
had spread to over 40 out of the 99 parishes that constitute Kampala.
Byarugaba told The New Vision on Monday that the number of cases recorded
at the centre had risen to 117. Five victims have died of the epidemic
since it broke out in November. The deaths have been classified as
community deaths since none of the victims died at a health institution.

Diarrhea Kills Manobo Child; 73 Hospitalized
------------------------------------------
A Manobo child died while 73 others were downed by diarrhea in Barangay
Malamba in Marilog District here.
As of yesterday, 7 more people were brought to the Davao Medical Center
(DMC) here for treatment of the same ailment.Dr. Roberto Alcantara, city
health officer, said the dead child was immediately buried. As of
yesterday, 10 of the victims have remained at the DMC.
Alcantara said his office would be sending a team to the village to gather
water samples. This would help authorities determine what triggered the
disease, he said. But Alcantara ruled out the illness as a symptom of
cholera [although why cholera is ruled out is not clear - Mod.LL].
The lack of source of potable water could have triggered the diarrhea
outbreak, he said.
