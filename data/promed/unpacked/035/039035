[As stated above, in the past 24 hours there have been a total of 4 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, 3 fatalities and 3 recoveries reported, bringing the total number of cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed since 20 May 2015 to 154, including 19 fatalities (reported case fatality rate 12.3 percent).

Three of the 4 newly confirmed cases were 3rd generation cases, infected while visiting family members in the Samsung emergency room. The 4th case was a 4th generation case having been infected through contact with a 3rd generation case (case no. 118) in the medical clinic. It appears as though transmission is slowing down. 72 of the 154 cases (46.8 percent) have a history of transmission in the Samsung emergency room where case no.14 had been. There have now been a total of 31 (20.1 percent) 2nd generation cases, 115 (74.7 percent) 3rd generation cases and 7 (4.5 percent) 4th generation cases.

As of noon, today [15 Jun 2015], there have been a total of:
1034 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including
456 deaths;
569 recoveries, and
9 currently active cases including one case on home isolation.

In the past 24 hours there have been:
1 newly confirmed MERS-CoV infection; and
2 newly reported fatalities;
0 new recoveries.

[Reported case fatality rate: 44.1 percent]

Information on newly confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection:
A 69-year-old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker from Hufoof reported to be in stable condition. A possible history of contact with other case(s) is currently under review.

Information on newly reported fatalities:
- A 45-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Hufoof, history of pre-existing co-morbidities [reported as a newly confirmed case on 2 Jun 2015, at which time he was noted to be in stable condition. At time of initial report, a possible history of contact with other case(s) was under review. - Mod.MPP]

- A 65-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Hufoof, history of pre-existing co-morbidities [reported as a newly confirmed case on 6 Jun 2015, at which time he was noted to be in stable condition. At time of initial report, a possible history of contact with other case(s) was under review. - Mod.MPP]

[The outbreak in Hufoof continues but seems to have been put on a back burner as the world has been focusing on the outbreak in South Korea.

Since 20 Apr 2015, there have been a total of 34 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV including 16 deaths (reported case fatality rate - CFR 47.1 percent). One wonders whether the apparent high CFR is an artifact related to finding more severe cases and the milder cases either do not present to the healthcare sector for care or are not tested for MERS-CoV infection (seek and ye shall find). - Mod.MPP]

Slovenia

"New tests on Monday [15 Jun 2015] ruled out the potentially fatal MERS virus in a South Korean man being kept in isolation at a hospital in Slovakia, a health ministry spokesman said... The South Korean was thought to be suffering from a combination of bronchitis and digestive disorders that have now receded, a hospital spokeswoman said..." [not surprising - Mod.MPP].

Expats home isolated in South Korea
http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v8/wn/newsworld.php?id=1144410
"About 20 to 30 foreigners in South Korea, including Japanese, have been isolated at home, not at medical institutions, over Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare said Monday [15 Jun 2015].

Transmission in Hospital B appears to have stopped, but not Hospital D
http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2015/06/16/2015061601280.html
"The number of new infections has come to a halt at St. Mary's Hospital in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, where the first confirmed case of MERS was reported, but Samsung Medical Center in southern Seoul remains a new source of new transmissions as the busy hospital handled huge numbers of patients every day."

Malaysia (Borneo)
http://www.theborneopost.com/2015/06/16/malaysian-pilgrim-died-of-lung-disease-not-mers-cov-says-dg/
"Tests have proven that a Malaysian who died while flying back from Jeddah had suffered from obstructive lung disease and not MERS-CoV, said Director-General of Health Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah. The individual was admitted to hospital for cough and breathing difficulty while performing the 'umrah' (minor haj), he said. ....Dr Noor Hisham also said that a woman who allegedly ran away from the Miri Hospital in Sarawak last Friday [12 Jun 2015] was undergoing treatment at the Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Hospital in Brunei Darussalam for a lung infection and not MERS-CoV. [presumably specimens were obtained for MERS-CoV testing and were found to be negative. - Mod.MPP]
