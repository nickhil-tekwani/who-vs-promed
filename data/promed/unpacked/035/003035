More than 4000 people are thought to have been struck down by Havelock North drinking water contaminated with _Campylobacter_. Prime Minister John Key is backing the Hastings District Council, saying it acted as quickly as it could. But he told Newstalk ZB's Mike Hosking there could be court action, as it's not clear whether the contamination contributed to the death of a woman in a rest home. He says that court action could involve civil or criminal charges.

The Ministry of Education says all Havelock North's schools and early childhood centres are expected to be open today, 22 Aug 2016. After the rolls are taken at Havelock North Intermediate, the students will be gathered for an assembly. "We'll just talk through hygiene basically. Over the next little while we'll have the Red Cross in during the day at points. We'll be talking about using the hand sanitisers and washing hands properly when using the loo," said Principal Julia Beaumont.

At the weekend, the Hawke's Bay DHB said interim results from the Institute of Environmental Science and Research suggests contamination from cattle and other 4-legged farm animals may have been in the water. Medical authorities noted that there was a marked decrease in the number of patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms.

Test results from the Hastings water supply came back clear yesterday afternoon, 21 Aug 2016, after earlier results showed an anomaly, put down to sampling irregularities. The Council said today's results mean the Hastings supply, which also provides water to Flaxmere and Bridge Pa, can continue to be considered safe to drink, however, it will continue to chlorinate the supply in the short term.

Dr Bridgette Sullivan-Taylor, an extreme event expert at Auckland University, criticised the official reaction to the outbreak, saying she was "staggered" at how quickly the disaster snowballed out of control. "Better planning could have minimised unintended consequences and downstream effects that make the disaster worse. The fact that contaminated water was brought into Havelock North in a tanker is staggering."

However, the district's Mayor Lawrence Yule maintained he didn't know how much quicker they could have acted. "We're talking hours here; I'm not sure how much faster we could have gone. The critical thing is that we now know that people are likely to have been getting ill on [Mon 15 Aug 2016], yet we had a clear test on [Tue 16 Aug 2016]," Yule said. "Clearly if we had known something was happening on [Tue 16 Aug 2016], with the water, we may have acted on [Tue 16 Aug 2016] but we had no indication anything was wrong."

Napier MP Stuart Nash said it's hard for locals to trust the water infrastructure again when it's still so unclear what went wrong. "We're not looking for people to blame, there's no doubt about that, but it's hard to know what to do or where to look next."

[The number of reported cases of gastrointestinal illness has about doubled to 4000 since the last report only 4 days ago. Contamination of municipal water can be from multiple pathogens, including viruses such as norovirus and rotavirus, bacteria such as _Salmonella_, _E. coli_, and _Campylobacter_, and protozoa such as _Cryptosporidium_ and _Giardia_.

An example of a past outbreak of campylobacteriosis in Finland is cited below:

Abstract
--------
In August 1998, an outbreak of campylobacteriosis occurred in one municipality in northern Finland. A 10 percent random sample of residents (population 15 000) was selected through the National Population Registry for a survey conducted by using postal questionnaires. Cases were defined as residents of the municipality with onset of acute gastroenteritis from 1 to 20 August 1998. Of 1167 respondents (response rate 78 percent), 218 (18.7 percent) met the case definition. Drinking non-chlorinated municipal tap water was strongly associated with illness (OR 34.4). The estimated total number of ill persons was 2700. _Campylobacter jejuni_ was isolated from stool samples of 45 (61 percent) out of 74 patients tested. All 5 isolates tested had indistinguishable PFGE [pulsed-field gel electrophoresis] patterns. Water samples were negative for _Campylobacter_ and coliforms. Epidemiological and environmental evidence suggested mains repair as the source of contamination. Non-chlorinated ground-water systems may be susceptible to contamination and can cause large outbreaks.
