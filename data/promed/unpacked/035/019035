----------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding the finding of a dead peregrine falcon in Hong Kong from which an H5 influenza virus was recovered, it is worth noting that the peregrine is a nearly obligate predator of other birds, especially shore birds. While the home range of a nesting pair of birds may be on the order of 15 mi [25 km], as noted, wintering birds, living up to their name, the wandering falcon, may in fact move over large regions. It is entirely probable that this particular individual was a wintering arctic or tundra peregrine, one which has a circumpolar distribution throughout the arctic. Peregrines have been casualties of H5 influenza in Hong Kong in the past.

HONG KONG, Jan. 21 -- A dead peregrine falcon found near two chicken farms here was infected with the avian influenza virus, agricultural officials here said Wednesday.
