PILCHARD MORTALITY SOUTH AUSTRALIA - UPDATE
Note: There are several inaccuracies in the previous ProMED note on
pilchard deaths (PILCHARD DEATHS - AUSTRALIA (SOUTH AUSTRALIA) (06)).
Undoubtedly, the astute reader would have been bemused by, for example, the
reference to 'farmed' pilchards. The update below gives consolidated
information. We will continue to provide authoritative updates to ProMED.
Update of spread:
-----------------
* Following reports from commercial fishermen of pilchard deaths in the
south-eastern part of Spencer Gulf beginning on 4 October, Primary
Industries and Resources South Australia (PIRSA) has confirmed pilchard
kills from around Ceduna (West Coast of South Australia) and extending
approximately 30km east of Goolwa at the mouth of the Murray River (South
East Coast of South Australia), including Spencer Gulf, the Gulf of St
Vincent and off Kangaroo Island.
* The extent of the kill is still expanding, particularly westwards, at
roughly the same speed as in the 1995 event. Densities of dead fish areas
appear less compared to 1995.
* The kill is mainly confined to pilchards; affected pilchards are mature
fish in good body condition.
* The fishing industry in South Australia and authorities in Western
Australia, Victoria and Tasmania are closely monitoring coastal waters for
any signs of further pilchard deaths.
Control measures:
-----------------
* Precautionary control measures remain in place: PIRSA and the
Commonwealth Government have suspended commercial fishing for pilchards
throughout the State until 31 October.
Public health:
--------------
* The South Australian Health Commission has reissued its advice that dead
fish including pilchards should never be collected for consumption by
humans or pet animals and direct contact with dead pilchards should be
avoided as a precaution.
Diagnostic testing:
-------------------
* An up-graded surveillance and sampling program was conducted over several
days, commencing Sunday 18th of October. This included sampling dead and
moribund fish from several locations off shore in South Australia.
* On Friday 23rd of October, the first fresh pilchard samples were
processed at the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong.
On-going testing includes gross pathology, histopathology, viral culture,
electron microscopy and molecular virology.
* Histopathology results conducted to date confirm microscopic lesions in
gills consistent with those observed in the 1995 kill, but in a smaller
percentage of fish examined, and to a lesser degree of severity.
* Electron microscopical examination of gill homogenates has demonstrated
small numbers of herpesvirus-like particles. Examination of ultra-thin
sections of gills is on-going. There are no conclusive findings to date.
Multidisciplinary scientific consultations:
-------------------------------------------
* The Joint Multidisciplinary Pilchard Scientific Working Group will
reconvene in Adelaide on Friday 29th of October. The Working Group has been
established under Australia's Consultative Committee on Emergency Animal
Diseases CCEAD. In this aquatic animal emergency event, CCEAD links
States/Territories Directors of Fisheries and States/Territories Chief
Veterinary Officers with Commonwealth authorities and the CSIRO Australian
Animal Health Laboratory. CCEAD is chaired by the Australian Chief
Veterinary Officer, Dr. Gardner Murray.
* The Working Group is chaired by the Director of Fisheries South
Australia, Gary Morgan, and covers expertise in marine biology,
oceanography, public health, epizootiology, and veterinary medicine.
* The Working Group will meet to coordinate the research and diagnostic
approaches now planned as well as underway in Australia, on an operational
level. Next to diagnostic work as the highest priority, these activities
include estimates of the percentage of biomass killed, estimates of the
size and age composition of affected fish, and transmission trials with
unaffected pilchards kept in captivity.

[We thank Gardner Murray for this update. As to prior inaccuracies we took
our information, having pruned the nationalist self-congratulatory prose,
from the Australian press who had, we presumed from the script, been
briefed by the relevant government office. This again reinforces the need
to draft press releases carefully. - Mod.MHJ
