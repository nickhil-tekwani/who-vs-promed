Moon Marine USA Corporation (also known as MMI) of Cupertino, CA is voluntarily recalling 58 828 lbs of a frozen raw yellowfin tuna product, labeled as Nakaochi Scrape AA or AAA. Nakaochi Scrape is tuna backmeat, which is specifically scraped off from the bones, and looks like a ground product. The Nakaochi Scrape is associated with an outbreak of 116 cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Bareilly in multiple states: Alabama (2), Arkansas (1), Connecticut (5), District of Columbia (2), Florida (1), Georgia (5), Illinois (10), Louisiana (2), Maryland (11), Massachusetts (8), Mississippi (1), Missouri (2), New Jersey (7), New York (24), North Carolina (2), Pennsylvania (5), Rhode Island (5), South Carolina (3), Texas (3), Virginia (5), and Wisconsin (12).

The raw yellowfin tuna product may have passed through several distributors before reaching the restaurant and grocery market, and may not be marked with lot information. Distributors and end users should consult their suppliers to determine the origin of any Nakaochi Scrape AA or AAA in their possession.

What Do Consumers Need To Do?
--------------------------
Because raw seafood is not fully cooked to assure that pathogens are destroyed, it is not considered as “safe” as cooked seafood. The handling of raw seafood can also affect the safety of the product. Because the tuna may have been broken into unmarked sublots and may not be readily identifiable, consumers should take precautions in choosing to eat raw Nakaochi Scrape and be sure that it is not from the implicated lots.

What Do Product Sellers Need To Do?
----------------------------
Product sellers, including distributors and restaurants, should consult their suppliers to determine whether the Nakaochi Scrape AA or AAA in their possession originated from Moon Marine USA Corporation (also known as MMI). The product may not be accompanied by lot numbers or labeling information.

What Does the Product Look Like?
--------------------------
MMI distributed the Nakaochi Scrape AA and AAA to several distributors that may have broken the shipments into smaller lots for further distribution. The frozen raw yellowfin tuna product was originally packaged in white boxes with black writing naming the importer as Moon Marine USA Corporation (also known as MMI) and identifying the contents as either Nakaochi Scrape AA or AAA. The boxes contain several vacuum-wrapped packages with no further labeling.

What is Being Done about the Problem?
-------------------------------
The FDA is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state and local partners to investigate the outbreak.The FDA is working closely with MMI to identify the implicated product and assist with its removal from the market.

[It is not specifically stated that the outbreak strain was isolated from the tuna 'scrape'. Be that as it may, this type of product fits the kind of food thought to be implicated, the so-called spicy tuna roll. The source of contamination of the tuna product is not as yet known since it is likely that the _S._ Bareilly did not start in the fish. - Mod.LL
