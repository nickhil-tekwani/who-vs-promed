Health authorities have declared a red alert in Peru's northern
Amazon jungle region following the outbreak of a "very aggressive"
dengue strain that has killed 14 people and sickened thousands.
Dengue is endemic to the jungle region, but until now, Peru has
largely dealt with the American strain of the disease. "[Authorities
are facing] a new variety that we did not know in Peru and that
probably entered from Brazil via the Amazon," health minister Oscar
Ugarte told local reporters. About 13 000 people have been infected,
and at least 1600 people have been hospitalised for treatment, a
health official in Loreto, in north-eastern Peru, told AFP.

A senior Loreto health official, Hugo Rodriguez, says this dengue
strain is known as the Asian-American variety and, unlike the
American variety, produces severe shock among victims. "It is a
combination of both varieties," Mr Rodriguez said. The virus can
result in deadly fevers, especially among children: Half of those
killed were minors.

Health officials in Iquitos, Peru's main city on the Amazon River,
located 1000 km [621 mi] north of Lima, have launched a fumigation
program in an attempt to diminish the number of mosquitoes.

[The 4 Feb 2011 edition of Global Voices
(<http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/02/04/peru-new-strain-of-dengue-spreads-in-the-amazon/>)
reported that a dengue outbreak that emerged in the Peruvian Amazon
region of Loreto has easily spread through several neighbouring
regions. On 1 Feb 2011, 4 confirmed cases had been officially
reported in Lima, the Peruvian capital. These are believed to be
cases imported from Loreto region, and not acquired locally in Lima.
In Iquitos, all 4 serotypes of dengue virus (types 1-4) have already
circulated; however, they have only reported minor and sporadic cases
of DHF. Nevertheless, in this outbreak, there are an unusual number
of cases with serious signs; it is thought to be due to the
introduction of the dengue 2 virus genotype III (Asiatic/American),
which was already associated with a large number of serious cases and
increased mortality in Brazil.

The 3 Feb 2011 edition of Terra
(<http://noticias.terra.com.br/mundo/noticias/0,,OI4927122-EI8140,00-Governo+d>)
reported that the Ministry of Health has declared a yellow dengue
alert in 14 of 28 departments of Peru.

[3] Malaysia - vector control

Malaysia has released 6000 genetically modified mosquitoes designed
to combat dengue fever in a landmark trial slammed Wednesday [26 Jan
2011] by environmentalists who say the experiment is unsafe. In the
1st experiment of its kind in Asia, about 6000 male_ Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes were released at an uninhabited site in the central state
of Pahang, the government-run Institute of Medical Research (IMR)
said. The IMR, which was tasked with carrying out the trial, said the
experiment was conducted on 21 Dec [2010] to "study the dispersal and
longevity of these mosquitoes in the field. The experiment was
successfully concluded on 5 Jan 2011," the institute said in a
statement dated Tuesday [2 Feb 2011], adding that no further releases
are planned until the trial results are analysed.

The insects in the experiment have been engineered so that their
offspring quickly die, curbing the growth of the population in a
technique researchers hope could eventually eradicate the dengue
mosquito altogether.

Females of the _Aedes_ species are responsible for spreading dengue
[virus], [that causes] a deadly disease, which killed at least 134
people last year [2010] in Malaysia alone.

The trial has sparked widespread concern among environmental groups
and non-government organisations (NGOs), and had been postponed due
to their protests as well as unfavourable weather conditions.

"I am surprised that they did this without prior announcement given
the high level of concerns raised not just from the NGOs but also
scientists and the local residents," said researcher Lim Li Ching
from 3rd World Network. The network is part of 29 public health and
environmental groups which have repeatedly demanded the government
cancel the trial, saying it was risky and could lead to unintended
consequences.

"We don't agree with this trial that has been conducted in such an
un-transparent way. There are many questions, and not enough research
has been done on the full consequences of this experiment," she told
AFP. Critics have also said that too little is known about the
_Aedes_ mosquito and how the genetically modified insects would
interact with their cousins in the wild. Authorities have dismissed
the fears and said the trial would be harmless, as the GM mosquitoes
can live for only a few days.

[This is a preview of what reactions can be expected for release of
genetically modified vector arthropods. It underscores the need for
provision of ample public information and discussion in advance of
field experiments so that there is no accusation of secrecy and to
provide the experimenters with an opportunity to state the advantages
for public health and discussion of potential risks, if any, with
critics. Eradication of _Aedes aegypti_ through the release of
sufficient numbers of genetically modified males will be a challenge
in large cities having large and widespread populations of this
vector mosquito.
