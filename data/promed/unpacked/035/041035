A variant of last year's [2009] pandemic influenza linked to fatal
cases carried a mutation that enabled it to infect a different subset
of cells lining the airway, according to new research. The study, due
to be published in the Journal of Virology, suggests that the mutant
virus could have impaired the lungs' ability to clear out germs. The
researchers behind the study, from Imperial College London, the
Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research and
the University of Marburg said the findings highlight the potential
for deadlier strains of flu to emerge and spread.

The 2009 pandemic of H1N1 influenza caused thousands of deaths
worldwide, but the majority of cases were relatively mild. A variant
of the virus carried a mutation termed D222G in a protein on the
surface of the virus, and people infected with this variant were more
likely to have severe and fatal illness [In the D222G mutant virus,
there is an amino acid substitution in position 222 of the
haemagglutinin molecule: aspartic acid is replaced with glycine.
According to the WHO, the overall prevalence of the D222G mutation is
recorded as less than 1.8 per cent of total cases of pandemic
influenza A(H1N1), compared with 7.1 per cent of fatal cases. - Mod.CP].

The new research shows that flu virus with the D222G mutation can
bind to a broader range of receptors in the airway, including
receptors that are present on cells called ciliated cells. [The
original text includes a micrograph showing the airway lining, with
hair-like projections visible on ciliated cells]. These cells, found
in the lining of the airway, have hair-like projections called cilia.
The cilia sway back and forth to move mucus with trapped particles
upward toward the mouth, and this is normally swallowed or coughed
up. When ciliated cells become infected, the cilia stop moving and
this vital clearance function is impaired. Inhaled viruses and
bacteria can then reach the lung more easily, where they can
potentially cause pneumonia.

The mutant virus has an increased capacity to infect ciliated cells,
as shown by the collaborating group at the University of Marburg.
Infection of the ciliated cells would sabotage the lungs' clearing
mechanism and could be one factor that made the D222G mutation more
virulent, the researchers suggest. "This simple mutation, which
swapped one building block of a virus protein for another, apparently
resulted in a more virulent version of the H1N1 virus," said
Professor Ten Feizi from the Department of Medicine at Imperial
College London, who led the study. "We think this is at least partly
due to the virus being able to bind to different receptors, which
allowed it to infect ciliated cells and stop them from clearing out germs.

"If the mutant virus were to acquire the ability to spread more
widely, the consequences could be very serious. The study goes to
show how important it is that the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance
Network continues to monitor closely the emergence of new variants of
the flu virus. Even though the 2009 pandemic was relatively mild,
it's vital that we handle outbreaks cautiously and stay vigilant. The
virus is constantly evolving, and it's possible that a new form as
dangerous as the 1918 pandemic could emerge."

Professor Feizi and her team study the receptor specificity of
different flu viruses by attaching onto a glass surface a range of
different carbohydrates, resembling the receptors present on the
surface of airway lining cells. The virus is then incubated on top of
the glass surface, and using a fluorescent dye, the researchers can
see the receptors on the plate to which the virus binds.

The study builds on earlier work by Professor Feizi and her
colleagues which showed that compared with seasonal influenza, the
2009 pandemic virus could bind to a broader range of receptor types.
The previous study showed that pandemic flu had some affinity for
so-called alpha2-3 receptors, as well as the alpha2-6 receptors
favoured by seasonal flu. Now they have shown that this affinity for
alpha2-3 receptors is substantially enhanced in cases of pandemic flu
with the D222G mutation. Whereas alpha2-6 receptors are found in the
nose, throat and upper airway, alpha2-3 receptors are prevalent in
the lung but also on ciliated cells throughout the respiratory system.

[The following is the abstract and reference for the report published
in the Journal of Virology: Y. Liu et al. "Altered receptor
specificity and cell tropism of D222G haemagglutinin mutants from
fatal cases of pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 influenza." Journal of Virology,
November 2010, Volume 84, Issue 22. (Open Access paper).
<http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/84/22/12069?etoc>.

"Mutations in the receptor-binding site of the hemagglutinin of
pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 viruses have been detected
sporadically. An Asp222Gly (D222G) substitution has been associated
with severe or fatal disease. Here we show that 222G variants
infected a higher proportion of ciliated cells in cultures of human
airway epithelium than did viruses with 222D or 222E, which targeted
mainly nonciliated cells. Carbohydrate microarray analyses showed
that 222G variants bind a broader range of 2-3-linked sialyl receptor
sequences of a type expressed on ciliated bronchial epithelial cells
and on epithelia within the lung. These features of 222G mutants may
contribute to exacerbation of disease."

In their discussion, the authors comment that: "Whether the selection
of the D222G mutation is a cause or a consequence of more severe
lower respiratory tract infection is still to be resolved. It is
evident, however, that its emergence is likely to exacerbate the
severity of disease. The altered receptor specificity and distinctive
cell tropism of the D222G mutants of H1N1pdm are hallmarks of a more
dangerous pathogen, emphasizing the importance of close monitoring of
the evolution of these viruses." - Mod.CP]
