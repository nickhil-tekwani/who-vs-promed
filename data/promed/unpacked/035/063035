The Ghana Health Service (GHS) says 25 people have so far died from the recent outbreak of yellow fever in Savannah and Upper West Regions.

A statement signed by Dr Patrick Kuma-Aboagye, the Director-General, and shared with the Ghana News Agency, Tuesday [16 Nov 2021], said 18 persons were also on admission.

The outbreak, which was initially detected in the Savannah Region, has now spread to the Wa East District of the Upper West Region, the statement added.

The GHS on [29 Oct 2021] notified the public of an outbreak of yellow fever in some districts in the Savannah Region, with 8 deaths reported.

The outbreak was confirmed after initial laboratory test results were conducted by the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research [in Accra] and the National Public Health Reference Laboratory.

The GHS, subsequently, dispatched a team of experts from the service, World Health Organisation Country Office, and the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) to the region to support the region investigating the outbreak and implementing appropriate control measures.

The statement said the team, among others, assessed the risk of yellow fever transmission based on the population of the vector responsible for transmitting yellow fever -- the _Aedes_ mosquito.

It said following the findings of the team, the service has implemented several interventions, including targeted vaccination of selected communities for yellow fever in the affected districts in a bid to keep the disease at bay.

As of [15 Nov 2021], more than 43 615 persons had been vaccinated in the Savannah Region as part of the intervention.

The GHS said it has also dispatched 50 300 doses of yellow fever vaccines from its headquarters with support from the Ghana Air Force to the Regional Health Directorate for onward distribution to the selected districts for vaccination.

The service assured that together with the Ministry of Health it would continue to engage partners, such as the WHO and CDC, to ensure that the outbreak was brought under full control.

"The Ghana Health Service will continue with efforts aimed at improving outcomes for persons who are unfortunately affected while continuing with the vaccination drive to improve the immunity of the population against Yellow Fever," it added.

[The yellow fever (YF) outbreak has now spread from the Savannah Region to the neighboring Upper West region. Case numbers have increased from 14 reported on 12 Nov 2021 (see Yellow fever - Africa (13): Ghana (SA) susp 20211114.8699655) to 25 cases reported above. The report above indicates that these are now laboratory confirmed.

The YF vaccination campaign and increased surveillance, both now underway, are essential to control this outbreak. A previous report indicated that in the affected areas only 60% of the residents are reported to have been vaccinated. One hopes that this percentage will reach at least 80% in the coming days and bring this outbreak to a halt. If there are abundant populations of YF virus vector mosquitoes present in an area where a large proportion of the population is unvaccinated, YF can quickly get out of hand. - Mod.TY
