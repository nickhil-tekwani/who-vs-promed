Following major flooding in the country, Region 6 is reporting 67 cases of dengue and 5 cases of leptospirosis.

Regional Chairman, David Armogan, during a press briefing in Region 6 yesterday, relayed that that while there are 67 cases of the mosquito-borne dengue presently there has not been any major escalation since.

"A number of areas are pretty dry, Black Bush Polder they don't have much difficulties with flooding and so, and a lot of those cases came out from Black Bush too", he said.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is widely distributed throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine of chronically infected animals may survive in freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Mice, as well as rats, can carry _Leptospira_ in their urine and serve as a reservoir for this organism (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6612401/#B12).

There are more than 250 serovars of _Leptospira_ species, with multiple serovars being endemic in a given geographic area. Protective immunity against _Leptospira_ infection is predominantly serovar specific. Different leptospiral serovars may be prevalent in particular geographical regions.

Human activities that place people at increased risk of leptospirosis include contact with rats or domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and dogs), walking barefoot in water or mud, swimming in rivers and other water sports, gardening or farming, and working in piggeries (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242886). Some names for leptospirosis are derived from the environmental situations associated with or groups at risk of developing the disease, such as swineherd's disease, rice-field fever, canecutter's fever or disease, swamp fever, and mud fever. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for a rodent infestation.

The diagnosis of leptospirosis requires confirmation by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM dipstick, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used to confirm the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939550/). Dr Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic that of leptospirosis.

Guyana is a country with a population of almost 750 000, on the northern Atlantic coast of South America. Guyana borders Brazil to the south and southwest, Venezuela to the west, and Suriname to the east (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyana#Administrative_divisions). Guyana is divided into 10 regions. Region 6, aka East Berbice-Corentyne, with a population of over 100 000 residents in 2012, covers the entire eastern border of the country (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Berbice-Corentyne). The Corentyne River forms the whole of the eastern border with Suriname.

Heavy rains, swollen rivers and flooding, described in the local media as "the worst flooding ever seen," affecting almost all the regions, was reported during the May-June, 2021 rainy season, and was predicted to continue into July 2021 (https://reliefweb.int/report/guyana/guyana-floods-dref-plan-action-n-mdrgy003). This news article cited health threats likely to emerge due to the use of pit latrines in some areas. - Mod.ML
