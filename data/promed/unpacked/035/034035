Scientists at Vanderbilt University and the University of South
Florida have discovered a new way to fight a fungus deadly to frogs.

The fungus, which causes skin infections in the amphibians and
interferes with their immune systems, is thought to be responsible for
declining frog populations across the globe.

But researchers found recently that frogs in captivity could develop a
resistance to the fungus after being subjected to warmer temperatures.

"The fungus doesn't like the heat," said Louise Rollins-Smith, a
Vanderbilt professor who worked with the researchers in Florida.

The scientists exposed frogs to the pathogen, often referred to as a
"chytrid" fungus, and then subjected the animals to warm temperatures.
They found theat 86 F [30 C] heat helped stimulate the frogs' immune
systems and clear the infection. The frogs also appeared to develop an
immunity to the fungus. "It's like a vaccination procedure,"
Rollins-Smith said. Once the frogs have developed a resistance in
captivity, their chances of survival may be improved once returned to
the wild, Rollins-Smith said. Theoretically, the process could be
used in small-scale projects to increase frog populations, she said.
"The best hope is for endangered species that have been brought into
captivity," she said. "Perhaps it's enough to get the population going
in the wild."

[_B. dendrobatidis_ (chytrid fungus) is a singular fungal pathogen. It
has a swimming zoospore as the infectious stage. It colonizes skin
cells of adult amphibians and the mouthparts of tadpoles. Infection
occurs when zoospores land on the skin or the mouthparts and encyst.
Through mechanisms that are not fully understood, the pathogen moves
from the surface of the skin to the stratum granulosum of the
epidermis and matures in the stratum corneum. There, it enters healthy
cells, grows in size, and develops into an urn-shaped zoosporangium in
which the zoospores develop. As infected skin cells move toward the
surface, the zoosporangium matures; the discharge papilla opens, and
mature zoospores swim out. The mechanism by which this pathogen causes
disease seems to be by interference with the ion transport functions
of the skin, leading eventually to cardiac failure.

It is known that the chytrid fungus is sensitive to high temperatures.
It does not grow above 25 C [77 F], and higher temperatures do not
favor epidemics. Environmental temperature has a direct impact on the
fungus. - Mod.PMB]
