I have found very interesting Edward McSweegan's issue about leptospirosis
and psychiatric sequelae and the comments shared by ProMED-mail, that were
kindly supplied to me by my colleague Noel Gonzalez.
During the development of our leptospiral vaccine, I had an accident at the
laboratory in 1996, during the challenge of the animals corresponding to a
protection test. I accidentally punctured a finger with the needle of the
syringe containing the challenge suspension of canicola serogroup. As the
puncture was not deep (almost epidermal, because of the glove I was
wearing) I felt no concern about the possibility I could become ill. The
control animals became sick six days after the challenge. I had slight
fever at the fifth and malaise, but I supposed it was a flu. I could never
imagine those symptoms could be due to leptospirosis. I continued with
fever and eight days after the accident I began with a terrible headache
and muscle pain. I had never had such a headache before, [and for [the
first time I [suspected it was due to leptospirosis. I was immediately
interned in the hospital and received doxycycline for treatment, as I am
allergic to penicillin.
The principal feature was liver damage, as all the enzymes were altered and
also the blood bilirubin value. The liver also increased slightly its
volume.
After that I have had too much work to think over this problem, but I feel
I have become angry and fall into depression easily. I suppose it is due to
a pre-menopausal stage, as I am 46 years old. I do not suffer of headaches
but I often feel a high pressure inside my head I had never felt before.

[As we often tell our students, one instance can mean anything but to date
we have had no other possible personal experiences of this phenomenon.
Although it is presumed that Esther had leptospirosis her account has no
confirmation from laboratory tests. - Mod.MHJ
