Eight District Commissioners from Kenya and Uganda on Friday held an
inter-border security meeting and imposed a ban on fish poisoning in Lake
Victoria. They directed the district fisheries officers to ensure that the
ban is effected.
The DCs, accompanied by top security officials from both countries, vowed
to stamp out criminal activities at the border. Speaking to the press after
chairing a closed-door meeting in Busia town, Busia DC Ezekiel Machogu said
patrols will regularly be held at the border to flush out criminals.
"Joint patrols will enable us to flush out criminals who hide in no man's
land after breaking law either in Ugandan or Kenyan side," said Mr.
Machogu. He said security will be intensified in the lake to eradicate
piracy which has become rampant. The meeting, he said, raised concerns over
smuggling activities along the border. It also covered tsetse fly control,
and customs taxes.
The Ugandan delegation was led by Iganga Resident District Commissioner,
Mrs Albina Opio, and comprised other DCs from Tororo, Bugiri and
Busia-Uganda. The Kenyan delegation consisted of DCs from Teso, Bondo and
Suba.
