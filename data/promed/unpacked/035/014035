[In our posting earlier today, "Newcastle disease - Russia," derived from a
Reuters news item, the following information was included: "In Mar 2004,
Belgium reported an outbreak of the disease among pet pigeons in the
northwest of the country."
Since no such information has been obtained/posted by ProMED-mail to date,
we find it appropriate to update our subscribers. - Mod.AS]

Cases of Newcastle disease in pigeons in Berlare and Zele
-----------------------------------------------
1. Press release, 16 Mar 2004:
The FAVV/AFSCA has identified Newcastle disease (ND) in pigeons belonging
to a hobby pigeon breeder in Berlare.
2. Press release, 24 Mar 2004:
The FAVV/AFSCA has identified Newcastle disease (ND) in pigeons belonging
to a hobby pigeon breeder in Zele. This person keeps about 120 pigeons and
5 chickens.
In both cases, the relevant municipalities were immediately informed in
order to apply the officially required measures within the 500-meter-radius
control area around the affected premises. These measures include:
-Banning of poultry gatherings
-Vaccination of all domestic poultry (excluding ducks, geese and quail)
-Pigeons and poultry to be slaughtered exclusively in slaughterhouses
specifically designated by a veterinary inspector
-All other movement of pigeons and poultry within the area is forbidden.
The said measures remain in force for at least 30 days.
Since 1993, all commercial poultry farms in Belgium are compulsorily
vaccinated against ND. No vaccination is required from small holdings (less
than 100 birds) for personal use.
Pigeons which participate in races and gatherings (exhibitions) must be
vaccinated. Cases of ND have been sporadically recorded in racing pigeons
in Belgium. Thus, the current cases are not exceptional.
