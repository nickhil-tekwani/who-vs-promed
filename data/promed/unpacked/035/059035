3 cases of CCHF (one fatal) in Southern Kazakhstan
--------------------------------------------------
According to data from the Kazakhstan Ministry of Emergency
Situations, a 22-year-old woman has died of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever (CCHF) in Kizilorda City Hospital.
On the same day, the Kizilorda District Healthcare Department
reported that, on 17 May 2005, a man was admitted to the Infectious
Diseases Hospital with a diagnosis of hemorrhagic fever.
Another report from the south of Kazakhstan stated that a 3rd man had
been hospitalized with CCHF. According to the Ministry of Emergency
Situations, anti-epidemic measures have been taken by the health
officials in the locations where the disease was contracted.
CCHF is an infection contracted by tick-bite. Rarely, the virus can
be transmitted from person-to-person by contact with blood from an
infected person.

[CCHF is caused by a tick-borne bunyavirus belonging to the genus
_Nairovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_. It is endemic in the
southern region of Kazakhstan. These 3 cases appear to be unrelated.
It would be useful to have further information concerning the nature
of the exposure in each case and the subsequent anti-epidemic
measures undertaken. Previously reported cases from Kazakhstan appear
to have been direct consequences of tick-bite with no subsequent
person-to-person transmission. - Mod.CP]
