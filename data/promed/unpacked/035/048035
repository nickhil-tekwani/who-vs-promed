A comment re: "Rabies, feral cat, human - Thailand (04): (KO)"
--------------------------------------------------------------
Aggression in cats cannot be regarded as abnormal, especially in feral
cats. Aggression can be caused by insufficient socialization and
[domestication] or poor training as a kitten. Moreover, "crazy cat" in
the Thai language may mean the cat is deranged. If the cat was really
rabid, there should be a prodromal phase when the cat's behavior
changes. In cats, the prodromal phase can last no more than 1-2 days
before transmission to the furious phase (hyper-responsive phase) or
the paralytic phase. Therefore, I think the mood of this cat was
naturally variable.

Finally, Thailand is an endemic area for rabies. People bitten by a
suspected rabid animal should be vaccinated immediately, with no
exception.

[It seems that the cat's behaviour did not necessarily mean that it
was rabid and in fact it could not have been; the island of Koh Samui
has been officially free of rabies since 1985 -- see ProMED archive
(05) below. - Mod.CP/JW]
