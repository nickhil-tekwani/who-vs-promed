This information supplements that which I sent you earlier. It came from
Novosibirsk Regional State Sanitary-Epidemiological Inspection at my
request. Here is the translation of the Russian text of reply prepared by
L. Ivanova, M.D., Deputy Director of the Inspection.
OMSK HEMORRHAGIC FEVER (OHF) IN NOVOSIBIRSK REGION
Cases of hemorrhagic disease of unknown origin first had been registered in
November-December,1961 in Zdvinsk, Barabinsk and Krasnoozersk districts
(counties) of Novosibirsk Region. The massive epizootics among musk-rats
inhabiting small lakes near settlements and after occasional collection of
dead and ill animals preceded human cases of the disease.
The diagnosis of the disease as infectious one and the possible way of
infection was firstly established by the specialists from Omsk Institute of
Natural Foci Infections (Russian Ministry of Public Health). The diagnosis
was confirmed by the isolation of OHF virus from dead animals and
registering the increase of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titers to
this virus in the blood of patients.
Cases of human disease cases were not registered between 1962 and 1987.
During the last ten years 152 cases (3 deaths) were registered among
humans. In all the cases the reason of death was because of late starting
of treatment (according to the patient story records. - my comment.SVN).
In 93% of all the cases patients had professional or occasional contacts
with musk-rats (hunting or tearing off the skin) on the lakes of above
mentioned districts, where epizooties were registered.
Novosibirsk Regional State Sanitary-Epidemiological Inspection collaborated
with Omsk Institute of Natural Foci Infections in investigation of
practically all the outbreaks of the disease.
Vaccination against tick-borne encephalitis virus [sic in Ust-Tarka had
been initiated this autumn by Novosibirsk Regional State
Sanitary-Epidemiological Inspection. Instructing professional hunters in
safe handling of musk-rats and their skins was organized by inspection
specialists. Information about this disease and prevention measures,
including vaccination, has been widely distributed among the population of
this area.

[again from Dr. Netesov ...
My comments regarding your comments to my first letter:
1. In Russian edition of Muller's English-Russian and Russian-English
dictionaries there are TWO equivalent translations to Russian word
"ondatra" - muskquash and musk-rat. In Oxford's Dictionary there is only
one - muskrat.
2. Ondatra (muskrat) is so common in Siberia now (I saw this animal a lot
of times in the small rivers and lakes near Novosibirsk) that only
specialists know that it had been imported from American continent.
3. Of course, the virologists in Russia know that OHF virus is close to TBE
in antigenic properties and by genome sequences. Therefore this decision
about vaccination was made. As for CEE (or TBE or RSSE) vaccines: there
are two inactivated chromatographically purified vaccines produced in
Russia: one in Moscow Institute of Poliomyelitis and Viral Encephalitis
with Sofjin strain of TBE [Sofjin is the prototype strain of Russian
Spring-Summer encephalitis virus - Mod.CHC virus, the second - in Tomsk
NPO "Virion" on the base of 205 TBE strain [unknown to me - Mod.CHC.
Austrian inactivated and chromatographically purified vaccine is produced
by IMMUNO company with strain Neudorfl [the standard western European
strain of Central European encephalitis virus - Mod.CHC.
The genome sequences of all three strains were published in the middle of
1980s and are similar to each other (from 5% - Sofjin-205 - to 16.3% -
205-Neudorfl - homology in amino acid sequences of E-protein).
There are no proven data regarding comparison of all these vaccines in
field studies.

Kertie Shah and others tested TBE vaccine vs. Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD)
both in the lab and in the field without success. KFD is now controlled, at
least in lab workers, by use of a killed vaccine against that virus. For a
good summary of recent work on the genetic relationships of the TBE complex
see the article by Gould, de Andrade Zanatto, and Holmes, "The genetic
evolution of flaviviruses", pp 51-63 in Factors in the Emergence of
Arbovirus Diseases, ed JF Saluzzo and B Dodet, Elsevier, 1997 or their
original publications. They show that OHF virus is closer genetically (but
not necessarily antigenically) to TBE than is KFD virus. Although CEE and
RSSE are considered to be essentially the same virus by some and although
these two clearly cross-protect in the lab, I have never seen any field
data that addresses whether a killed vaccine against one will protect
humans from the other.

Some historical notes:
Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV) was isolated from _Ixodes marginatus-
ticks and from patient's blood by Professor MP Chumakov et al. in 1947. The
first description of this hitherto unknown disease was made in 1946 by
clinician Galina Sizemova and epidemiologist Anna Gavrilovskaya. They
described a winter 1944 outbreak among hunters for ondatra (Ondatra
zibethicus) [musk-rat, musquash, muskrat. The hunters prepared the
ondatras in their homes and used the meat for food because of shortage of
food during the war time.
The disease was characterized by high fever and profuse lung and uterine
hemorrhages. Often two-wave course of the disease occurred. In 1947 the
great spring-summer outbreak of OHF was registered among agriculture
workers in the forest-steppe locations of the Omsk region (listed by Dr.
Netesof); mortality was about 10%. The season of outbreak followed the
cycle of _Ix. marginatus_. In 1948 another outbreak occurred. In that
summer vaccination of the rural adult population of the endemic areas was
made with OHF virus vaccine prepared from infected mice brains.
After vaccination no outbreaks were described but sporadic cases were
reported among ondatra hunters in Omsk and Novosibirsk regions. OHF virus
was regularly isolated from ondatras, ticks and field mice. Serologically,
OHF and Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) viruses are very similar. First data
about serodifferentiation of these viruses were determined by D. Clark
[Delphine Clarke at Rockefeller Institute, many years ago. - Mod.CHC in
diffuse immunoprecipitation and later by me in neutralization test in PS
[porcine stable cells. Differentiation of these viruses is important
because often there is a co-localization of their endemic areas.

[Our readers are greatly appreciative of the timely input by these three
experts. As you can see, the term "TBE" is a confusing one and should be
discarded, except as the (poor) name for the disease. Using a single name
for more than one virus is very misleading with respect to vaccine efficacy.
It remains to be seen whether this outbreak of OHF is simply one of
numerous sporadic occurrences or whether it will be shown to have spread
from a focus. I will not comment on the use of vaccines prepared from
virus amplified in mouse brains but I wouldn't take one. - Mod.CHC
