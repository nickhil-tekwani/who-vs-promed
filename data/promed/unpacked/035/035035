Over [50] cats at the Humane Society of Indianapolis (HSI) were
euthanized because they had a contagious virus, the agency said.

"You can see the center corral is sadly empty. We lost those cats,"
said Christine Jeschke, Indianapolis Humane Society. "There were 5
cats in there and they were all in pain and suffering and our vet made
the decision to euthanize them this weekend [28-29 Nov 2009]."
A stray cat infected with a new form of virulent systemic feline
calicivirus (VS-FCV) was dropped off at the shelter last week [week of
23 Nov 2009]. It was given routine vaccinations, but then something
strange started happening to others.

"We started seeing more severe signs. Usually you don't see a fever of
106 [deg F/41.1 deg C] or cats with swollen lymph nodes that are
really painful and can't walk," said Dr Christine Towns, Indy Humane
Society.

Within a week the virus had claimed the lives of 65 cats. The virus is
not a threat to humans or dogs. It stays strictly with felines. Humane
Society workers say it spreads like "wildfire."

"To lose perfectly healthy cats -- they were healthy the day before.
In a day their fevers had spiked and they had ulcers in their mouths.
It was shocking," said Jeschke.

All other cats are under quarantine for 2 weeks, and the shelter is
being disinfected.

Though cats are currently unavailable, HSI has dozens of puppies and
adult dogs for adoption. The shelter's retail store, canine training
school, and dog park remain safe and open to the public, and HSI
encourages people to consider its animal-welfare partners Southside
Animal Shelter, ARPO, Cats Haven, and Indianapolis Animal Care and
Control if interested in adopting a cat. The strain of VS-FCV
affecting HSI's cats hasn't appeared in the other groups' animals.

"The staff at HSI is emotionally devastated and heartbroken by this
outbreak," said John Aleshire, CEO of the Humane Society of
Indianapolis. "We hope our immediate action with cleaning and
quarantine protocol will keep our remaining cats healthy and able to
find a home in time for the holidays."

If you'd like to help HSI fight this virus and save feline lives,
please donate bleach, paper towels, bath towels, and bleach wipes to
the shelter, located at 7929 Michigan Rd.

[There are many serologically related strains of feline caliciviruses
(FCV). They appear to have a predilection for the epithelium of the
oral cavity and the deep tissues of the lungs. Some caliciviruses are
nonpathogenic. Some induce little more than salivation and ulceration
of the tongue, hard palate, or nostrils; others produce pulmonary
edema and interstitial pneumonia. Clinically, it is often impossible
to differentiate FVR (feline viral rhinotracheitis) from FCV
infection. 2 strains may produce a transient "limping syndrome"
without signs of oral ulceration or pneumonia. These strains produce a
transient fever, alternating leg lameness, and pain on palpation of
affected joints. Signs occur most often in 8- to 12-week-old kittens
and usually resolve without treatment. The syndrome may occur in
kittens vaccinated against FCV because no vaccine protects against
both of the strains that produce the "limping syndrome."

Calicivirus has also been found in cats with lymphocytic-plasmacytic
gingivitis and stomatitis (ulceroproliferative faucitis/stomatitis).
The superficial lesions heal rapidly, and the infected cat regains
appetite 2-3 days after onset. The clinical course usually is 7-10
days. An acute febrile response, inappetence, and depression are
common signs. Serous rhinitis and conjunctivitis also can occur.

The characteristic lesion caused by FCV is ulceration of the oral
mucosa. Lesions on the tongue or hard palate initially may appear as
vesicles, which subsequently rupture. Ulcerations are occasionally
found on the epithelium covering the median nasal septum. The more
virulent caliciviruses destroy epithelial cells of the bronchioles and
alveoli, which causes acute pulmonary edema that progresses through
seropurulent bronchiolar hyperplasia and interstitial pneumonia.

While treatment is usually supportive, some antibiotics have been
helpful in dealing with secondary bacterial infections in severely
affected cats.

There are 2 types of modified live virus FVR-FCV vaccines available.
The 1st type is intended for parenteral administration; cats older
than 9 weeks should be vaccinated twice, with a 3-week interval.
Kittens should be vaccinated at intervals of 3-4 weeks until they are
12 weeks or older. In adult cats, revaccination with a single dose
every 1-3 years is indicated.

The 2nd type of vaccine is administered to healthy cats by
instillation into the conjunctival cul-de-sacs and nasal passages.
Owners should be advised that cats inoculated oronasally may sneeze
frequently at 4-7 days after vaccination. Kittens vaccinated when less
than 12 weeks old should be revaccinated on reaching this age. Annual
revaccination with a single dose is recommended.

Modified live virus FVR-FCV vaccines intended for parenteral
administration are available in combination with either chemically
inactivated or modified live virus feline panleukopenia vaccines. A
parenterally administered vaccine composed entirely of inactivated
viruses also is available.

Hopefully with Purdue University being close to Indianapolis, some of
the cats went for necropsy and some study to determine if this really
is a new form of FCV or if the FCV has combined with some other virus
or mycoplasma.
