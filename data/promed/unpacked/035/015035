Command & Control Center
Update in Statistics: Ministry of Health Institutes New Standards for Reporting of MERS-CoV - 3 Jun 2014
----------------------------
Last month [May 2014], the Ministry of Health's Command & Control Center launched a rigorous examination of data related to MERS-CoV patients from 2012 onwards. The main objective of that review was to ensure a more complete and accurate understanding of the MERS-CoV outbreak in the Kingdom. The review has already enhanced the Ministry's policy development process and improved measures taken to address the situation.

Following the review, the new total number of cases recorded in the Kingdom between 2012 and today [3 Jun 2014], is 688. Of that total, 282 of the cases were fatalities, 53 are currently receiving treatment; 353 have recovered.

Based on the findings of the review, the Ministry has already put in place a number of measures to ensure that best practices of data gathering, reporting, and transparency are being strictly observed, and that the necessary systems and processes have been put in place to ensure that from now on, case information will be accurate, reliable and timely.

Dr Tariq Madani, Head of the Scientific Advisory Board within the Ministry's Command and Control Center said: "The Ministry is committed to fully understanding MERS-CoV and putting in place the policies needed to protect public health and safety. To do this, the Ministry has reviewed historical cases of MERS-CoV to give a more comprehensive understanding of the facts. While the review has resulted in higher total numbers of previously unreported cases, we still see a decline in the number of new cases reported over the past few weeks."

Measures that have been taken to ensure the reliability of information and speed of reporting include the development of an electronic case reporting system and improving reporting mechanisms on new cases to the MoH Command & Control Center.

Additionally, the capacity, efficiency and quality of the standardized labs and testing facilities was upgraded through a series of measures that included:
- Authorization of additional labs to perform standard testing.
- Standardization of testing kits across all labs and implementation of quality assurance processes.
- Development and implementation of guidelines for the proper labeling and storage of samples in hospitals and labs.
- Development and implementation of efficient specimen transport protocols to guarantee the integrity of samples during transport and ensure accuracy.
- Improving access to authorized MoH labs through implementation of a robust countrywide courier transportation system for rapid transfer of specimens to regional labs.

Dr. Madani added: "This review has informed the Ministry's policies, and it took stringent action to combat MERS-CoV, announcing the new Command and Control Center to increase the level of preparedness for future public health challenges, issuing infection control protocols to contain the spread of the virus, and directly engaging the public with an awareness campaign."

[The above report, based on a review of MOH reports on suspected MERS-CoV infected cases, represents an increase of 113 cases of MERS-CoV infection including 92 new deaths as of 2 Jun 2014; the day prior to this announcement, the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia had been 575, including 190 deaths.

The addition of these retroactively reported new cases and deaths increases the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia to 688 including 282 deaths. This represents an increase of approximately 19.7 percent in the number of reported cases of MERS-CoV infection and a 48.4 percent increase in numbers of deaths and changes the observed case fatality rate in Saudi Arabia from 33.0 percent to 41.0 percent. It is unclear what the reasons for reclassification were; there is much room for speculation here. There's an excellent media discussion of this observation by Helen Branswell that can be found at http://metronews.ca/news/canada/1054551/who-wants-details-on-new-mers-cases/.

Hopefully, there will be follow up reports from the Saudi MOH with revised epidemiologic analyses of the situation, including these new cases and deaths. There has been much speculation regarding the role of healthcare workers (HCWs) in the transmission of the MERS-CoV in the healthcare setting, but updates clarifying the database on the proportion of cases in HCWs would be helpful to address this question. - Mod.MPP]

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update - 4 Jun 2014
----------------------
On [1 Jun 2014], the National IHR Focal Point for Jordan reported to WHO an additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Amman, Jordan.

The case is 26-year-old male health-care worker. He presented with fever on 23 May 2014. His condition deteriorated as he developed pneumonia and gastrointestinal symptoms, and he was admitted to the hospital on 30 May 2014. A specimen was collected and tested positive for MERS-CoV on 31 May 2014. He is currently in a stable condition. He has no known comorbidities but does have a history of contact with a laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV health-care worker case reported to WHO on 11 May 2014. He has no history of travel and no history of contact with animals.

Tracing and screening of 6 family members and 54 health-care workers for MERS-CoV is currently ongoing.

Globally, 681 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including 204 related deaths have officially been reported to WHO. This global total includes all of the cases reported in this update, plus 44 laboratory-confirmed cases officially reported to WHO by Saudi Arabia between [19 May 2014 and 2 Jun 2014]. WHO is working closely with Saudi Arabia for additional information on these cases and will provide further updates as soon as possible.

WHO advice
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health-care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.

It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients -- regardless of their diagnosis -- in all work practices all the time.

Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.

Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[On 1 Jun 2014, the ProMED-mail update on MERS-CoV included a media report on a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection in a nurse from a private hospital in Jordan. No details on the case were provided. The media report included in the 1 Jun 2014 ProMED-mail update mentioned a fatality, whereas the above report is of an individual in stable condition (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (73): Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Jordan, WHO, RFI 20140601.2512766 for the original ProMED-mail report).

ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate clarification on the earlier report as to whether the report of a fatality was erroneous, or whether that earlier media report represents another case that has not as yet been officially reported to WHO.

[5] UAE update - media report
Date: 3 Jun 2014
Source: The National [edited]
http://www.thenational.ae/uae/government/health-minister-reports-67-mers-cases-and-9-deaths-in-uae


The Minister of Health addressed the Federal National Council on Tuesday [3 Jun 2014] to answer questions about the MERS coronavirus.

67 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome have been documented in the UAE, including 9 deaths, said Abdul Rahman Al Owais in a presentation over-viewing the virus and the global and local response efforts.

This figure does not seem to include the case of a 73-year-old Emirati man, who contracted the disease in the UAE then was transferred to Munich, where he died in March last year [2013].

The minister said 18 UAE nationals had contracted the disease, of which 4 have died.

The ministry has trained health staff in schools, it said, with 273 staff members trained in Dubai, 227 in Abu Dhabi, 130 in Sharjah, 45 in Ajman, 40 in Umm Al Quwain, 45 in Ras Al Khaimah and 60 in Fujairah.

It has also conducted trainings among staff working in the medical sector, with 1370 trainees in Dubai, 1235 in Abu Dhabi, 743 in Sharjah, 305 in Ajman, 282 in Umm Al Qaiwain, 337 in Ras Al Khaimah and 290 in Fujairah.

[This article represents a nice summary of the current state of reported cases of MERS-CoV infection identified in the UAE. The absence of inclusion of the earlier case diagnosed and treated in Germany may reflect the absence of diagnosis of the disease while in the UAE. All of these cases have been reported in previous ProMED-mail reports (see below references). It is curious that of the 67 cases confirmed by the UAE, only 18 (26.9 percent) were in Emerati nationals; this information was not available previously.

[6] ECDC Assessment 2 Jun 2014
Date: 2 Jun 2014

Risk of MERS-CoV in Europe remains low, ECDC updates its risk assessment - 2 Jun 2014
---------------------------------------
Currently, the risk of human infections and sustainable human-to-human transmission in Europe remains low, concludes ECDC's 10th rapid risk assessment on Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. However, the number of human MERS cases reported from the Arabian Peninsula has increased rapidly in the past few months. Specifically, several healthcare associated clusters in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have been reported which have been responsible for large numbers of cases. Given the large number of people travelling between the Arabian Peninsula and Europe, it is likely that more cases will be imported and detected in the EU/EEA. Continued vigilance in assessing patients with travel history to the affected region is warranted.

Since the previous (9th) ECDC rapid risk assessment on MERS-CoV was published on 24 Apr 2014, it has become clear that false negative results cannot explain the increase in cases, and it is unlikely that mutations have led to increased human-to-human transmission. Three other scenarios likely to play a part in the current epidemiology are:

- increased zoonotic transmission leading to increased introductions to community and healthcare facilities;
- suboptimal infection control in hospitals;
- a more sensitive case detection algorithm used in some areas that has led to the current increase in numbers of cases.

In addition, there is an increasing body of evidence that dromedary camels are the direct or indirect source of infection for many of the human cases.

Options for action
The updated rapid risk assessment contains options for action in the following areas:
- Travel advice: there are no travel restrictions in place; however, those travelling to the region should consult a doctor if suffering from a severe medical condition; avoid travelling if ill with an infectious disease; ensure good hygiene practices; avoid contact with animals, especially camels, and do not consume unpasteurised milk or undercooked meat.
- The international public health community could consider providing further outbreak assessment support to better understand modes and sources of transmission, determine optimal management of patients and encourage serological surveys.
- EU/EEA Member States could review their preparedness in the event of a large MERS cluster; sensitise public health professionals and healthcare workers to the possibility of MERS presenting in returning travellers and increase awareness of the available testing, infection control, surveillance and reporting guidance.
ECDC publishes the latest reported epidemiological data on MERS-CoV and other public health threats in the weekly Communicable Disease Threat Report (CDTR) every Friday.

Full report: 10th Rapid Risk Assessment on MERS-CoV, 31 May 2014 [available at http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/RRA-Middle-East-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-update10.pdf.]

[As with previous ECDC risk assessments, the full report provides an in depth epidemiologic analysis of the state of information available on MERS-CoV as of the date of preparation. In this instance, this review is current through 22 May 2014 when there was a global total of 665 cases including 205 deaths of MERS-CoV infection reported in the world. The review does not include the 2 cases in Algeria returning from having performed Umrah in Saudi Arabia and reported by WHO AFRO, and the 2 cases reported by Iran that had contact with an individual returning from Saudi Arabia, nor does it include cases reported by Saudi Arabia since 22 May 2014. Of note, 97 percent of the cases occurred in the Middle East (in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Jordan, Oman, Kuwait, Egypt, Yemen and Lebanon). All cases outside of the Middle East had either recent travel history to the Middle East countries or contact with someone returning from the Middle East.

Figure 2 in the report is an epi curve showing the distribution of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported between 2 Apr 2014 and 22 May 2014 by day and reporting country, representing 457 cases reported during this period. (see the full report at: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/RRA-Middle-East-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-update10.pdf). Of the 665 cases, 354 (53 percent) are considered to be primary cases without a known link to previously confirmed cases (based on information available at the time of preparation of the report. The male:female ratio is 1.7:1, and the median age of cases is 49, (50 for males and 46 for females). Of note, of the 665 reported cases, 111 were in health care workers (17 percent); this may be an underestimate of the situation, as information on profession of cases was not always available. Information on animal host studies are also reviewed in this report and covered nicely by Mod.AS in ProMED posting "MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (75): Animal res, camel, zoonotic aspects," archive number 20140604.2518134.

According to the WHO update included in [4] above, the global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported to WHO is 681 cases included 204 deaths (case fatality rate of 30.0 percent). This does not include the 116 cases including 94 deaths reported by the Saudi MOH on 3 and 4 Jun 2014, which would increase the global tally to 797 cases including 298 deaths (case fatality rate of 37.4 percent). This revised total does not include the 2 cases reported by Algeria, the 2 cases reported by Iran, the 7 cases in Jordan confirmed by retrospective serologic evidence of prior MERS-CoV infection. As mentioned in numerous previous updates, it has been exceedingly difficult to maintain up-to-date listings of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection and deaths and present an accurate tally of the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths. This moderator has attempted to use the WHO confirmed cases contained in the WHO updates and then adjust to represent expected future confirmations and reports to WHO. Outside of Saudi Arabia, many of the preliminary reports are coming from media reports that are confusing, such as the report of a recent fatal case in Jordan which may well have confused 2 different cases (see statement above following section [4]. - Mod.MPP]
