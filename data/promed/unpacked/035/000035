A rare form of toxic alga has been blamed for causing the deaths of
thousands of fish at Possum Kingdom Lake, a Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department biologist said Monday.
The fish kill was first noticed a week and a half ago and is continuing,
said biologist Joan Glass, a member of the state's Kills and Spills Team,
who said estimating the number of dead fish has not been done but it is
in the "thousands."
Glass said her investigation of water and fish samples show the culprit
to be "golden algae," single-celled organisms whose scientific name is
_Prymnesium parvum_.
Toxic chemicals released when golden algae blooms attack fish, by
causing exposed cells, such as those on the fish's mouths and gills, to
hemorrhage. The hemorrhaging impairs the fish's ability to obtain
oxygen and results in suffocation.
"Golden algae generally cannot compete with other forms of algae but,
if something knocks down other forms, golden algae can flourish and
bloom," Glass said. "We have documented the presence of golden
algae in a few other areas but this is the first case where it has caused a
fish kill in a Texas reservoir. Glass said golden algae bloom caused
fish kills in a few tributaries of the Brazos [River and in the upper
Pecos River between 1970 and 1988.
The largest number of dead fish at Possum Kingdom has been
concentrated in the Cedar Creek arm of the lake, but dead fish also
have been found in other areas, including Rock Creek and the upper
reaches of the Brazos River. Approximately 90 percent of the dead fish
seen have been freshwater drum [shad and gizzard shad, but virtually
all other species of fish have been affected, Glass said.
A count of 607 dead fish made by a reporter on Saturday along a 200-
yard span of shoreline at Possum Kingdom State Park included
largemouth and smallmouth bass, striped bass, crappie, sand bass,
sunfish, carp, buffalo, drum and gizzard shad. Glass said channel
catfish and gar also are suspected to have been killed by the algae.
Although biologists know golden algae often blooms when other forms
of non-toxic algae are suffering from lack of nutrients and other factors
that influence their blooming capabilities, very little else is known
about it.

[Possum Kingdom State Park is a major reservoir in Texas. It is
important for wildlife, water conservation and recreation. Some areas
around the reservoir are well populated by humans, while others
support mainly wildlife. This kind of fish kill is most unusual. -
