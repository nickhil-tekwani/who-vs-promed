Indonesia has detected the 1st outbreak of bird flu in tsunami-ravaged Aceh
province, where hundreds of chickens have died from the disease, the
Agriculture Ministry said Thursday [24 Nov 2005].
Bird flu has now been found in 23 of Indonesia's 30 provinces, said Sjamsul
Bahri, the Agriculture Ministry's director of animal health. The deadly H5N1
strain has jumped from birds to humans, killing 7 people in Indonesia.
But the emergence of the virus in Aceh -- where tens of thousands of people
still live in crowded refugee camps following the 26 Dec 2005 tsunami -- is
especially worrisome.
Bahri said chickens have been infected with the H5N1 strain of the virus in at
least 3 districts of the province. "Hundreds of chickens have died," he said.
Aceh was the area hardest hit by the tsunami. More than 130 000 people died in
the province and another half million were left homeless.

Hundreds of chickens in Aceh province have died of bird flu, said Syamsul
Basri, director of animal health with the Agricultural Ministry.
Poultry infected with the H5N1 strain of the virus were discovered in 3
districts including Pidie in the northeastern part of the province, Basri said.
'The virus mostly hit Arabic (variety of) chickens and the case was reported
to us 3 weeks ago. If added up, there were hundreds of them infected but they
have all been stamped out,' Basri told Agence France-Presse. Some died of the
virus while other sick birds were destroyed to prevent the virus from
spreading, he said.
Indonesia has had more than a dozen suspected human bird flu deaths, but only
7 have been confirmed by the World Health Organisation while 4 others were
also confirmed to have contracted the virus but are still alive.

[3] SE Asia, control measures
Date: Thu, 24 Nov 2005
From: Les Sims <apvis@bigpond.net.au

I would like to offer the following points on vaccination, based on 1st-hand
experiences in using vaccine in Asia against H5N1 highly pathogenic avian
influenza:
1. Regardless of official lines, there is considerable under-reporting of this
disease in Asia. This is not through malice on the part of veterinary
authorities, but because of insufficient veterinary capacity and authority,
failure to recognise the disease and sub-clinical infection (e.g. ducks), and--
sometimes -- "hiding" of disease by owners or marketing of infected flocks.
This is especially true in countries with large populations of poultry in the
smallholder and village sectors. Reported cases represent the 'tip of an
iceberg' of infection.
2. This situation will not magically improve. Building veterinary capacity
takes time. Even offers of improved compensation to farmers may not enhance
reporting if farmers feel their livelihood is threatened (compensation, when
provided, does not cover losses of income while farmers are not allowed to
produce poultry, and this can extend to months).
3. Mass culling can be used successfully to contain and eradicate H5N1 highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus in an area that has recently been exposed to
it. It can also help to contain outbreaks of disease and dampen down levels of
infection in endemically infected areas. However, the value of widespread
culling diminishes dramatically if the virus is already widespread in a
region. In such situations areas that are depopulated run a high probability
of getting re-infected once re-populated. The situation in Hong Kong from 2001
to 2003 is instructive in this regard.
4. Endemic diseases should be treated as endemic diseases, and this is
precisely why vaccination is being used as one of the control measures in Asia
at present. The argument that vaccination will lead to an endemic situation is
fallacious if a virus is already endemic.
5. Vaccination will dampen down the levels of infection, but if used alone
will not result in elimination of a virus from a country (although it can help
to do so on individual farms). If the goal is eradication, then vaccination
must be accompanied by other measures such as changes in the way poultry are
reared and marketed, enhancement of biosecurity, etc. However, in many Asian
countries, these changes will lead to major social dislocation (e.g. 13
million rural households rear poultry in Viet Nam alone). In some countries
vaccination is now being used to dampen down infection as a prelude to further
structural changes.
6. Vaccination is one of a number of tools available for control of this
disease, and these tools have to be used in a manner appropriate to individual
countries, taking into account their current disease status. High-quality
vaccines must be used, and this remains a concern when massive quantities of
vaccine are being produced to meet demands.
7. When assessing successes and failures of vaccination, it is important to
compare the post-vaccination situation against the pre-vaccination situation.
In other words, ask whether vaccination has led to improvements. Based on my
experiences, the situation in places such as Hong Kong and other parts of
southern China would be much worse without vaccination.
8. If vaccination is used, post-vaccination surveillance is essential,
especially for detection of circulating virus through targeted surveillance.
All viruses detected must be assessed genetically and antigenically for
evidence of significant antigenic drift.
9. It is quite likely that antigenic drift will occur (and has already
occurred) in H5N1 viruses. However, this should not be used as a reason not to
vaccinate. If so, we would not be vaccinating humans against influenza. What
is needed now is open sharing of isolates and -- preferably -- formation of an
international scientific group to advise on composition of influenza vaccines
for poultry, with the group given full access to available data on antigenic
analyses and experimental studies of vaccinated poultry challenged with
current isolates. Such a group should also be given access to funds to allow
it to conduct necessary trials where gaps in data are apparent.
10. Spread of virus by vaccinators is a genuine threat, and measures need to
be taken, as described by others, to minimise this. However, even when these
measures are used, there will still be some inadvertent spread of virus by
vaccinators in a mass vaccination campaign. However, it needs to be recognised
that this is probably far less significant than the considerable spread
already occurring via marketing of infected unvaccinated poultry and through
poultry industry workers who travel from farm to farm or household to
household purchasing birds, delivering feed etc. Vaccination will at least
help to reduce the risks from these movements.
Summary
-------
In summary, nobody wants to see vaccination against H5N1 highly pathogenic
avian influenza become part of the routine vaccination program for poultry in
the long term. However, there will be a need to use it this way in some Asian
countries for some time as countries strengthen their veterinary capacity and
implement other control measures. We also need to prepare for a worst-case
scenario in which vaccination may be needed indefinitely, especially if a
highly pathogenic virus is found to be firmly established in wild bird
populations or as long as rural households continue to depend on low-input
poultry rearing for a sizeable part of their income.

[4] China, control measures
Date: Thu, 24 Nov 2005

Many would agree with Dr. G. Donald Ritter about what can be done in The PRC
if they do decide to vaccinate all birds. They have the people to do it and,
if it's a National Project, it will be done.
Remember, houseflies were almost eradicated in the 1970's or certainly brought
well under control when the [Chinese] government decided it was high-priority
objective. It was done with fly swatters, not insecticides. Just imagine what
fly swatters in the hands of 1.25 billion dedicated people can do when it is a
state mandate.
During a team visit there in 1977, the only flies we saw were around some
spilled milk in a dairy barn. There were so few, you could count them.

[We would appreciate being informed from the Chinese side which vaccine types
and what kind of vaccine application mode(s) are envisaged. China sent a new
update on the situation to the OIE on 22 Nov 2005. According to this update, 3
new H5N1 outbreaks affecting chickens and geese have been confirmed, one in
each of the following separate regions: Xinjiang Autonomous Region (Urumchi
city); Ningxia Autonomous Region (Yinchuan city); and Yunnan province
(Chuxiong city).

Romania's agriculture ministry said on Monday [21 Nov 2005] that laboratory
tests in Britain had confirmed the deadly H5N1 virus in dead poultry last week
in a Danube delta village. "Regarding the samples in Caraorman, the laboratory
in London confirmed it was the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus," the ministry
said on its website.
Romania said on 14 Nov 2005 that 4 new cases of avian flu in domestic birds
had been discovered in Caraorman. It said the village, which has no road
access, would be quarantined and 2000 domestic birds would be slaughtered [see
20051117.3350].
The Balkan state in October 2005 became the 1st country in mainland Europe to
detect the deadly H5N1 virus in poultry in 2 villages in the Danube delta,
Europe's largest wetlands near the Black Sea.
