Over the weekend, 8807 cases [of suspected influenza were admitted to
accident and emergency units.
Many patients had Sydney flu H5N2 [should be H3N2 - Mod.CYC which hit
the SAR [Special Administrative Region last year. Some had received
vaccination against the virus provided by the Department of Health.
[This could not be true - Mod.CYC
Professor of Microbiology at the Chinese University John Tam Siu-lun
said there was also evidence of a new strain of the Sydney flu virus.
"Once a patient has had the flu, they should be immune from further
infection of that strain," Professor Tam said. "The fact that so many
people are being infected again suggests there is a need to test for a
new strain."
The university had sent samples this month to the World Health
Organisation for checking, Professor Tam said.

At least 96 people have died and more than 26,000 have become ill in a
flu epidemic sweeping Japan. The victims were mostly elderly and
children, and the flu hit hardest on those in their 70s and 80s, the
Asahi Shimbun said. Although the flu epidemic was not as deadly as an
epidemic last year which left 1.27 million sick, the health ministry was
calling for special precaution at schools and nursing homes, the daily
said. As a precaution, 54 schools have closed, it said.

There is a high possibility of a major influenza outbreak this year, an
official from the Department of Health (DOH) warned today. Tu Hsing-tze,
the director of the Bureau of Communicable Disease Control under the
DOH, said that last week alone, the number of reported cases of acute
respiratory infection topped 183 000. The figure is similar to one
reported in the peak
week of a 1997-1998 outbreak.
Tu warned that the outbreak could begin before the Chinese New Year
holiday, which falls on Feb 16, and lasts until mid-March.
