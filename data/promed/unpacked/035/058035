A growing cluster of _E. coli_ cases is reported by local health department in Ohio
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ohio's Wood County is experiencing an uptick in _E. coli_ cases. The Wood County Health Department reports 3 years of _E. coli_ cases have occurred just during the past week. Health Commissioner Ben Robison told the Wood County Board of Health on [Thu 11 Aug 2022], that 16 known cases of _E. coli_ have been identified in the last week. In the last 5 and a half years the county has logged 27 _E. coli_ cases. The health commissioner said: "We are in the very front stages of an investigation."

The Ohio Department of Health is testing to see if there is a link between the cases, which affected Wood County residents between the ages of 13 and 60. Test results are due back [Tue 16 Aug 2022]. The 15 known cases are likely just the beginning, according to Robison. "This number we expect will grow," he said.

The health department is asking that anyone in the county who believes they are or have recently experienced possible _E coli_ symptoms go to https://woodcountyhealth.org/health-promotion-and-preparedness/infectious-disease/ and click on the "take this survey" link in blue.

Of the cases reported so far, at least 5 people were hospitalized, ranging in age from 21 to 60 years of age.

Wood County Health is partnering with other agencies to try and solve the puzzle of the origin of the _E. coli_. Those partners include the Ohio Department of Health and other county health departments. It could be expanded to the Ohio Department of Agriculture if a link is identified to food products in the early stages of growing or processing. Robison explained that people sometimes believe the last place or food item they ate is the culprit when it comes to gastrointestinal issues. But the first symptoms of _E. coli_ may not show up until 10 days after they ate the contaminated food, he said.

A health board member reported on [Thu 11 Aug 2022] that a relative of his became very ill and had to be taken to the hospital after eating at the Wood County Fair. But Robison noted that the fair food establishment may not have been the problem. Robison is hopeful that the lab results from ODH will provide vital information - such as if the _E. coli_ is all the same strain. "We're moving quickly but intentionally," he said.

[Although not specifically stated, the organism discussed here is certainly an enterohemorrhagic _E coli_ (EHEC). The prototypic EHEC strain is O157:H7. About 10% of infections can develop hemolytic uremic syndrome due to the effects of the Shiga toxin, and it is believed that antimicrobial therapy, often given empirically for presumed bacterial enteritis, can increase the risk of this potentially fatal complication.

Given the cluster, it is likely that they are all related to a specific source.

Wood County, Ohio, is in northwestern Ohio, just south of Toledo. - Mod.LL
