[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD) is a disease of common carp, _Cyprinus carpio_, and its ornamental varieties that has had a significant effect on their culture since the mid- to late-1990s. The disease, as far as is known, only affects _C. carpio_, but the causative virus is highly infectious for that species and is easily transmitted to susceptible individuals or populations. The disease appears to have been spread to most continents with the transfer of ornamental carp, and in many countries has then been transmitted to common carp, both cultivated and feral.

The causal agent of koi herpesvirus is not a risk to human health (https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/78694). - Mod.CRD
