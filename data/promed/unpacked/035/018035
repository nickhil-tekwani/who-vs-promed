STREPTOCOCCUS INIAE IN HUMAN DISEASE: REQUEST FOR INFO
======================================================
This is a request for information. We are currently investigating 4
cases of symptomatic Streptococcus iniae infections. Three of these
were antibiotic-responsive cases of cellulitis and the fourth, a case of
sepsis. At least three of the four had a history of trauma while cleaning
fish.
This organism is a known fish pathogen, but our understanding is that it is
not a previously reported/recognized human pathogen. Can anyone provide
further information on this?
Thank you.
