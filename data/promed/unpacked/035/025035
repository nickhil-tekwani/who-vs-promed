I am doing some research on the extent of the Spanish Influenza of
1918-19, and I have come across some sources that identify the island of
St. Helena as the only region on earth that was unaffected. On the other
hand, I have also come across one source, the book "The Great Epidemic" by
A. A. Hoehling, that identifies the island of Tristan da Cunha as the only
unaffected region. Is this true of both islands? If you could provide some
assistance, even directing me to a published source, if possible, I would
be deeply grateful.

mentioned plus Pitcairn & Ascension Island, would have escaped. Does
anyone have references? - Mod.JW]
