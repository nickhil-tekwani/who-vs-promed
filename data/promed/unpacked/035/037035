In the moderator comments on the bat rabies death in Texas, the question
was asked what message should we be telling the public. I think that is an
excellent question.
At the end of September and beginning of October, there were three big
brown bats diagnosed with rabies in Kansas City, MO. The location of these
bats suggested that a rabies epizootic might have been occurring over a
significant portion of the City. Two of the bats were found in homes and
in one case I recommended post-exposure prophylaxis for the family and
booster vaccinations for their dogs, in spite of lack of a known bite. In
the 3rd case, a homeowner who read about the 1st case elected to take a
broom to a bat flying outside near his air conditioner. After traumatizing
the bat, the homeowner called Animal Control because of a "sick" bat on his
lawn. In addition, the publicity in our local media regarding the 1st bat
resulted in a telephone call from a lady who probably had been bitten a
week earlier by a bat that she encountered while washing her walls. She
was started on post-exposure treatment by her physician on the day she
called my office.
It is difficult to convey a good message through the media to the public
since reporters like to "jazz" up the story if at all possible. Yet, it is
important that communities be made aware of rabid bats and we publicize
each and every occurrence. The basic message that my staff and I try to
convey is that bats are part of the urban wildlife, that some bats have
rabies, that the majority of rabid bats (in my 20 years with the Health
Dept) are not aggressive, that children must be taught to leave bats alone,
that dogs and cats should be properly vaccinated against rabies, and that
bat houses probably are not a good idea within a City. Several years ago,
we published a paper on "Bats, cats and rabies" in the Southern Medical
Journal (86:1115-1118, 1993) in which we pointed out the importance of
having pet cats vaccinated against rabies.
One situation that is difficult to provide guidance to a citizen or health
care provider is what to do when a bat is just found flying in a house or
apartment and there was no known bite. Do we recommend treatment in each
instance? If we did that in Kansas City, then we would have between 50 and
100 such recommendations per year because of bats in dwellings.
Getting physicians to understand the new CDC recommendations on rabies
post-exposure prophylaxis when a bat is involved is whole lot harder than
dealing with the general public, particularly when dealing with managed
care situations. The family I mentioned earlier that was advised to get
rabies post-exposure treatment was not treated by their HMO for two days
because there was no proven bite (then only the person known to have been
bitten would have been treated). Finally, late at night one of the doctors
actually read the CDC guidelines and treatment became a priority first
thing the next morning. So how does public health change the thinking of
the medical community that bats are not dogs and cats, and that the
criteria for considering post-exposure prophylaxis are not the same?
The latest issue of Lancet [Volume 350, Number 9087 - Saturday 1 November
1997 contains a case report on a bat bite that illustrates how difficult
it is to establish the existence of a bite. Having dealt with rabies
issues for 25+ years in public health leaves me amazed at the either the
over-reaction or under-reaction to rabies. My office still gets 2-3 calls
a week from physicians who want to institute rabies post-exposure for
gerbil or hamster bites.
