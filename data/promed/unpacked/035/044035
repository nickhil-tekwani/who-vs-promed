[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 422 829, with 81 218 cases reported by China. There are now a total of 341 611 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 197 countries/locations outside mainland China representing an increase of 41 291 cases when compared with the data on 23 Mar 2020, with the USA accounting for 8722 (21.1%) cases, Italy accounting for 5249 (12.7%) cases, and Spain for 6922 (16.8%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside of China now represents 80.8% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 13.0% of the global cases of COVID-19. A global total of 18 907 deaths have been reported, 15 626 outside mainland China.

It is now clear that while China has the largest population in the world, and was the original location where the COVID-19 outbreak started, it has markedly reduced transmission to a manageable level, monitoring all arrivals in the country from outside. South Korea has slowly decreased daily new case counts hovering around or below 100 in recent days. Within 1-2 days, the USA will be number one outside of China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and Italy and Iran will drop back in their rankings. I repeat my request to see epidemic curves by date of onset to see what the true curve of transmission is, as I suspect now that more testing is being done, many of those tested have been sick for days while awaiting testing. - Mod.MPP]

[In addition to no newly confirmed cases reported from Wuhan or all of Hubei province in the past 24 hours, there were also no suspected cases reported. This is a major milestone and the 1st day zero cases, neither confirmed nor suspected, were identified. There are 47 newly confirmed cases reported to have been confirmed in the past 24 hours elsewhere in China, with all 47 identified as imported cases.

According to the report above, a total of 81 218 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, representing an increase of 47 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (23 Mar 2020) report was prepared. In addition, 4 deaths were reported, 3 of the 4 deaths were in Hubei province. 30 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, which bears watching as the cases have been slowly but steadily climbing. And Macau reported 1 additional newly confirmed case in the past 24 hours, bringing their total to 26.

All 47 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Cases were reported by Shanghai (19), Beijing (5), Guangdong (5), Fujian (4), Tianjin (4), Jiangsu (2), Inner Mongolia (2), Sichuan (2), Zhejiang (1), Jilin (1), Shandong (1), and Shaanxi (1), bringing the total number of imported cases to 474.

China is ending its lockdown: "China is ending its lockdown of most of Hubei province at midnight, officials announced in a notice on Tuesday [24 Mar 2020]. But Wuhan, the city in Hubei province where the coronavirus outbreak began at the end of last year [2019], will remain under lockdown until [8 Apr 2020], they said. After 2 months of intense lockdowns and thousands of deaths, Hubei province reported zero local cases of COVID-19 for 5 days in a row starting on [19 Mar 2020], according to CNN. On Tuesday [24 Mar 2020], Hubei province reported 1 new case: a doctor in Wuhan's Hubei General Hospital." (https://www.livescience.com/wuhan-coronavirus-lockdown-lifts.html). The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing...

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 100 cases and 6 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (22-23 Mar 2020) when there were 76 newly confirmed cases. The daily case count has been at or below 100 newly confirmed cases per day for 4 consecutive days. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 70.7% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeonbuk with 13.8% of the total cases reported. Looking at recent activity, for the 1st time in several weeks, Daegu did not report the 40% or more of the newly confirmed cases, but only reported 14.0% of the newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Quarantined imported cases represented 34% of the newly confirmed cases followed by Gyeonggi with 21.0%% of the newly confirmed cases.

Similar to what is being seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases coming from Europe (and I would suspect they are beginning to notice a similar trend in people coming from the USA). They are now up to 101 imported cases in quarantine with the 1st report of patients in quarantine on 16 Mar 2020, when 4 cases were reported (COVID-19 update (41): global, surge capacity, vaccine development, WHO 20200316.7096222). Like in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. There are obvious concerns regarding initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

The English language MOH report from 25 Mar 2020 (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) has epidemic curves by date of confirmation with cumulative case curves juxtaposed on each of the curves. The country-wide epidemic curve shows the slowing of cumulative case counts leading the curve to start flattening out rather than continue the sharp ascent it had been on. The same observations apply to Daegu City, and Gyeongbuk province. In contrast, Seoul City and Gyeonggi province both show the cumulative curve continuing on a sharp upward slope.

Cases in Italy as of 6:00 pm 24 Mar 2020
----------------------------------------
Regarding health monitoring related to the spread of the new coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] on the national territory, there are 69 176 total cases. At the moment 54 030 people are positive for the virus, 8326 people have recovered. There are 21 937 patients hospitalized with symptoms, 3396 in intensive care, and 28 697 are in home isolation.

There have been 6820 reported deaths, however this number can be confirmed only after the Istituto Superiore di Sanita has established the actual cause of the death.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 69 176 cases, including 6820 deaths, up from 63 927 cases and 6077 deaths reported on 23 Mar 2020. The 24-hour change between 23 and 24 Mar 2020 was 5249 4789 newly confirmed cases, compared with 4789 newly confirmed cases between 22 and 23 Mar 2020, breaking the 3 day trend(?) for decreasing daily numbers of newly confirmed cases, with a 9.6% increase in reported newly confirmed cases. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (30 703), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (9254), and Venice (5958), all in the northern part of the country. Those 3 provinces combined account for 59.1% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Another active province is Piedmont with a total of 5515 cases and represents 12.5% of newly reported cases. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. As for seeing an impact, one shouldn't expect to see an impact until at least one incubation period has passed, as there are newly infected individuals who are still in their incubation period for up to 14 days. That being said, hopefully the 27.0% decrease in reported cases over a 72 hour period was a sign of slowing down of transmission, and not of reporting variance. The 9.6% increase in the past 24 hours will hopefully not continue to rise. As mentioned before, the Public Health world is looking at Italy to see if this lockdown is feasible and if it has an impact in terms of slowing down transmission of the virus.

https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/coronavirus-half-of-iran-government-employees-to-work-remotely-1.1585062946674


President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday [24 Mar 2020] about half of all Iranian government employees were staying at home as part of measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East's worst-affected country, state television reported. "Many government employees will continue to work from home but civil servants with sensitive jobs that are vital for the public will be allowed to work from the office," said Rouhani.

"The aim is to keep more people at home." The death toll from the respiratory pandemic in Iran increased by 122 to 1934 on Tuesday [24 Mar 2020], among a total of 24 811 infections, according to Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur.

[In the 24 hours from 23 to 24 Mar 2020, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 23 049 to 24 811, an increase of 1762 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 1812 to 1934 an increase of 122 deaths in the 24-hour period.

As I have mentioned for the past few days, the significant translocation of the population for the holidays is of concern as it may lead to continued intra country/provincial exportations of the virus.

[The CDC data are lagging in real time with respect to state reports; to compile an up-to-date table with number of cases by state would require going to 50 states and additional territories (such as Puerto Rico, Guam, US Virgin Islands, or American Samoa, to name a few) to capture). But the table above gives an idea of the situation in the states probably current for a day or 2 ago. This is the 1st time I can remember that there hasn't been an easy go-to source of information providing a global overview of an epidemic in the USA. The Worldometer coronavirus update cited in [1] above, by clicking on "USA", provides somewhat more up-to-date case counts for each of the 50 states. A good visualization of the burden of disease by city can be seen on the Johns Hopkin's CSSE website map. If you zoom in on the USA, it gives a reasonable overview. https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6.

There is a good epidemic curve by date of onset in the USA, on the CDC website https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html#epi-curve. It captures information from 12 Jan 2020 through 23 Mar 2020, but has an "n" of 7309.

Conclusions: Given the daily increases in reported cases (as reported to WHO, and captured on the 2 excellent websites -- Johns Hopkins CSSE and Worldometer, the epidemic in the USA is escalating at a very rapid rate, with the USA to surpass Italy in a few days' time (see sections [1] and [7] for latest reports. New York State (and especially New York City, is the epicenter of the epidemic in the USA at present. All 50 States and the District of Columbia have reported cases, as have Puerto Rico, Guam, and the US Virgin Islands. We are in lockdown mode in New York City and surrounding counties. - Mod.MPP]

[6] Italy vs the UK Commentary Mod.SH
Date: Tue 24 Mar 2020
From: Stuart Handysides <promed@promedmail.org> [edited]


On 9 Mar 2020, I was curious to see if the difference in COVID-19 in different European countries could be explained in terms of population densities. The available data (table [case numbers from Johns Hopkins; population densities from Wikipedia]) indicated that Italy's startlingly high number of cases was clearly not related to population density, although it was a factor that one might expect to have a bearing on viral transmission.

Country / Population density (pop/km2) / number of cases / cases per million population

UK / 273 / 274 / 4.1
Italy / 200 / 7375 / 123
(Lombardy) / 417 / 4189 / 420
Germany / 233 / 1040 / 12.5
Netherlands / 419 / 265 / 16
France / 123 / 1209 / 18

The comparison between the UK and Netherlands was interesting. Close neighbours, both countries with a major airport hub. The Netherlands has a denser population and at that time 4 times the number of cases per million population.

Why were there so few cases in the UK? Were we just not testing as many people? Why did Italy have so many cases? Was it simply bad luck, that more infected people had arrived there earlier and advanced the outbreak?

An article in today's Guardian newspaper (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-how-do-italy-and-the-uk-compare) makes some suggestions that may help to explain it. One of the observations is that "in Italy, many older people are more tightly connected to family and friends" (generally a good thing, but not in the presence of a contagious disease) and another that "23% of its [Italy's] population are aged 65 and over. The UK has 18% of its population in this age category."

The article also refers to Germany where, with 21% of its population over the age of 65, one of the lowest national death rates has been observed (94/24 873 [Johns Hopkins data]) - 0.4%.

Is the UK simply behind Italy by a period of weeks, or is the outbreak proceeding differently? The Guardian's article refers to a comparison of deaths in the 1st 14 days after the 1st 5 fatalities were reported in Italy and in the UK, conducted by Professor David Spiegelhalter of Cambridge University's Statistical Laboratory. Their figures suggest that death figures rose in the UK by a daily average of 30%, compared with 37% in Italy.

This does not sound enough to explain the current almost-10-fold discrepancy in case numbers and an approximately 20-fold difference in the numbers of deaths (UK 6650 [335 deaths], Italy 63 927 [ 6077 deaths] ProMED-mail 24 Mar 2020; Public Health England https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/f94c3c90da5b4e9f9a0b19484dd4bb14).

[Stuart is a resident of the UK and is raising some interesting observations and queries. I wrote to Stuart raising some caveats, somewhat thinking aloud, and he asked me to include these in a moderator comment: I'm a bit wary of just using deaths as an indicator of progression of an outbreak as it relies on population risk factors and healthcare infrastructure, among other variables. The confirmed case rates depend on public health infrastructure, health infrastructure for testing, and population dynamics and culture, among other variables. For example, is social distancing more difficult in some cultures than in others? Anecdotal reports out of Italy mention with the limited surge capacity of the health sector, wartime triage was being used in some areas, which would definitely impact the numbers of fatalities. - Mod.MPP]

- WHO and its partners are constantly working to strengthen the chains of essential COVID-19 supplies. As global demand rises, WHO and its partners aim to ensure assistance to areas most in need. More information can be found in the 'subject in focus' section below.

Subject in focus: Strengthening supply chains to create greatest impact
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO and the World Food Programme (WFP) are exploring ways to work with the Pandemic Supply Chain Network (PSCN) and Logistical Emergency Teams (LET) to ensure that logistical assets are in place to support the increasing global demand for COVID-19 supplies. This is to ensure that supplies are allocated effectively and equitably in the places where they are needed the most.

WHO is also working with the World Bank to develop demand modeling from a country-based perspective. This will allow the sharing and support of technical guidance and allocation mechanisms and ensure that critical supplies are distributed with most impact.

The planning effort will support the mapping of scenarios as well as what is needed for stocks and procurement. With the engagement of the World Bank, the PSCN seeks to bring together the overview of the market's capability to provide and distribute the necessary supplies, WHO demand forecasting and the necessary financial and political support to fight COVID-19.

Representatives from both WFP and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) have joined the WHO team at HQ to establish the Supply Chain Coordination Cell (SCCC). The objectives of the SCCC are to:
- establish a COVID-19 supply chain working group to deepen inter-agency collaboration with the aim of minimizing disruptions to current humanitarian operations, while increasing efficiency and coherence of the COVID-19 response;
- provide a centralized voice through the collection and dissemination of information to the UN Crisis Management Team (UNCMT), other relevant forums, as well as the wider humanitarian community, to support strategic guidance, operational decision-making, and overall monitoring;
- foster the creation of regional and country level coordination mechanisms aimed at implementing efforts, while maintaining the overall coordination of the response;
- create a smaller joint procurement group of medical equipment buying agencies.

WHO and its partners are constantly working to strengthen the chains of essential COVID-19 supplies. As global demand rises, WHO and its partners aim to ensure that those areas most at need receive as much assistance as much as possible.

These data come from Table 1: Countries, territories or areas with reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Data as of [10:00 AM 24 Mar 2020], available at the source URL above. I am presenting the regional case totals without the addition of China for consistency in following trends in the regions. - Mod.MPP]

WHO region (no. countries/territories): Total confirmed cases (new) / Total deaths (new) / Transmission classification [no. countries] local / no. countries imported / no. countries under investigation

Western Pacific Region (16): 14 833 (797) / 219 (22) / Local (13) / Imported (3) [does not include China] / Under investigation (0)
European Region (60): 195 511(24 087) / 19 189 (1447) / Local (50) / Imported (7) / Under investigation (3)

Grand total (including China and Diamond Princess): 372 757 (39 827) / 16 231 (1722)

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside `the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 193. This includes 16 countries (including 3 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 6 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 20 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 48 countries (including 11 territories) from the Americas region, and 39 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 12 428 new cases in the past 24 hours of which 85.2% were reported by the USA, and 5.2% reported by Brazil. The European region continues with rapid transmission, having confirmed 24 087 new cases and 1447 deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, with Italy accounting for 19.9 % (dropping from 27.2% yesterday, 23 Mar 2020) of newly confirmed cases, Spain for 18.8% of newly confirmed cases, Germany accounting for 18.4% of newly confirmed cases, and France accounting for 15.8% of newly confirmed cases (bringing the total of these 4 countries accounting for 72.8% of newly confirmed cases in Europe).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [20 Mar 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic in China, juxtaposed with the increasing epidemics outside of China. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. If one looks at the last 4 days on the epidemic curve it looks as though the European region may be leveling off in terms of numbers of newly confirmed cases each day on the curve, whereas the Americas region is increasing significantly. It is too soon to declare definitive trends but it bears watching closely. It would be very nice to see an epidemic curve based on the date of onset of illness.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
