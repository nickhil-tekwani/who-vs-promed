Measles outbreak in Kono district of Sierra Leone
-------------------------------------------------
Health authorities in Kono district, eastern Sierra Leone have confirmed an outbreak of measles in 7 out of 14 chiefdoms in the diamond-rich district following a test of 20 medical samples from the area which recorded 5 positive cases, according to district disease surveillance officer, Sahr Amara Moiba.

Moiba said the affected areas are Fiama, Nimikoro, Nimiyama, Gorama-Kono, Sandor and Tankoro chiefdoms. He said the tests were carried out at the Central Reference Laboratory in Freetown, with 98 percent of the cases being children between birth and 1 year of age. He said the viral disease is transmitted through coughing and sneezing and that symptoms include fever, running nose and cough, reddish eyes and sore throat.

Moiba revealed that hundreds of health workers from 84 peripheral health units (PHUs) in the 14 chiefdoms of the district have been trained on how to treat the sickness, as part of preparation for the forthcoming national vaccination exercise against measles scheduled for 5 to 10 June 2015. Worried parents in the area have urged the government to step up efforts to save children not yet infected in the said chiefdoms and across the nation. However, the Health Ministry in Freetown is yet to come out with a comprehensive statement on the issue.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) has dispatched an emergency support team to train local health personnel on how to tackle the outbreak and save the most vulnerable of children.

The number of measles cases in Ceara this year reached 141, according to the epidemiological bulletin released Fri (29 Jun 2015) by the Department of Health. There have been 8 new cases since last Friday.

Ceara is experiencing a measles outbreak that has lasted 18 months, which is considered an extension of the Pernambuco measles outbreak that occurred in 2013 and 2014. Even with new cases, the incidence of measles is slowing in Ceara. In 2014, the state had recorded 694 cases. The Government of Ceara says it will continue the vaccination campaign against the disease to end the epidemic cycle. For the epidemic to be considered over, there must be 90 days without new cases of measles.

According to the Department of Health of Ceara, most cases occur in the city of Caucaia, Greater Fortaleza. On Saturday (30), the secretariat should have provided vaccination in places such as plazas, schools and supermarkets. The campaign in the city is scheduled from 9h to 17h. People [who should be vaccinated include those] up to 29 years of age or up to 49 years if such person has never received immunization, or have lost their vaccine record.

Ceara must clear cases of measles in 60 days to end the outbreak. Ceara already has 100 confirmed measles cases in 2015, according [to] Sesa Agents [who] go to homes to administer measles vaccine in Fortaleza.

Measles is an acute infectious disease, viral in nature, serious, transmissible and highly contagious, very common in childhood. It is transmitted directly from person to person through secretions expelled when coughing, sneezing, talking or breathing. According to experts, this form of transmission is responsible for the high contagiousness of the disease.

In January 2015, representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health met in Fortaleza to discuss the number of measles cases in Ceara. According to the Ministry of Health, the state [could reverse] the America's measles-free status if the disease is not contained. "It is a time to focus efforts. Children 6 months to 5 years should be properly [vaccinated," said] Carla Domingues.

Vaccination:
Measles vaccine is effective in about 97 per cent of cases. It should be applied in 2 doses from the 9th month of the child's life. Except for pregnant women and immunosuppressed individuals, adults who have not been vaccinated and have not had the disease in childhood should also get the vaccine. The main form of prevention is vaccination by MMR, available at clinics throughout the year. "If one does not know if he took the MMR vaccine, does not know if he had measles in childhood, and has no proof of vaccination, he should look for a clinic to be vaccinated," says Renata Dias, technical adviser of the Department of Immunization, City Health Department (SMS).

Health Ministry investigates origin of measles infections
---------------------------------------------------------
This weekend the Ministry of Health confirmed the detection of 2 cases of measles, a disease that can cause death in extreme cases. The cases are a man (aged 31) hospitalized in a private clinic since Fri 5 Jun 2015, but recovering favorably. "Currently epidemiological research is being undertaken to determine where the infection occurred and the target for vaccination."

Under-secretary of public health, Jaime Burrows said today that the last outbreak in Chile was recorded in 2011, associated with Chileans who had had traveled abroad or foreigners entering the country with the disease. But for more than 20 years there had been no accounts of indigenous cases.

The Health Ministry says there are 250 000 children who are not protected against measles. "Chile is free of indigenous transmission. Outbreaks have occurred [due to] imported virus," said Burrows. The secretary explained that while the disease is eradicated worldwide, there will always be a population susceptible to the virus in Chile of between 12 and 15 per cent. So later in 2015, between October and November, a vaccination campaign against measles will be held. The ministry estimates that the number of children under 6 who are exposed to the disease is 250 000, although the National Plan for Immunization (PNI) against this virus is free to all children a year old, with a 2nd dose in 1st grade, explained Fernando Munoz, the head of PNI, in February to La Tercera.

1 of the reasons that could explain the number of unimmunized people is the increase in [the number of] parents who choose not to vaccinate their children for fear of side effects. In the United States, there is concern that cases of measles will increase from fewer than 200 in 2013 to a record 668 in 2015. Meanwhile, between January and May 2015, Chile recorded 169 infections.

169 cases of measles have been reported in Alsace since early April 2015. Of these 169 cases, 93 are from the "epicenter" of the outbreak, a school in Logelbach, including parents who have resisted vaccination of their children. Another 10 people were hospitalized last Monday. At Mathias Gruenewald Logelbach school, 1 in 4 students was hit by measles.

At the school near Colmar, the spring break lasted for 3 weeks instead of 2. And 30 children have still not returned, not having been vaccinated against measles. "Only immunized children have returned to school after the closure of 1 week," said the head of Vegas pole (Monitoring and management of health alerts) of the regional health agency (ARS). The 30 children whom their parents refused to vaccinate despite the epidemic are taking courses at home.

The school, a Steiner foundation, is a private institution not under contract with the Ministry of Education. The school doctor says that the school is not obliged to follow the directions issued by the ministry, particularly with regard to vaccination.

In Alsace, the virus remains concentrated in the center of the region. Of the 169 cases reported to the LRA by physicians, 151 were Upper Rhine. "Most cases are concentrated in and around Logelbach Colmar and Ribeauville," said Dr Tariq El Mrini.

10 patients, all from Upper Rhine, had to be hospitalized, [mostly] young adults, aged 20 to 30 years. The last hospitalization occurred no later than Monday at Mulhouse. This time, no deaths have been reported, unlike the epidemic of 2008-2011 that killed 7 people in France (not in Alsace). "Measles is a disease which are considered benign but can escalate with damage to the lungs or liver," as well as [the nervous system], says Dr El Mrini. There is no treatment, "you have to lower the [patient's] temperature and avoid dehydration."

Since the arrival of the virus in early April 2015, "the curve peaks and troughs, with between 10 and 20 cases reported every week," says the doctor. The epidemic follows a steady pace. 30 people are currently infected in Alsace. With a 14-day incubation period, measles patients are contagious for 10 days around the rash characteristic of the disease. Knowing these figures, doctors wait 21 days after the declaration of [the last] case to [declare that] the epidemic is over. The last case in Alsace was announced last Saturday [6 Jun or 30 May 2015?].

ARS and the prefecture of Haut-Rhin [remind the public of] the importance of getting vaccinated and [confirming it was administered customarily] during infancy. "Vaccination, updated with 2 doses , is highly recommended for all persons born after 1980, aged at least 12 months," the prefecture reminded the public yesterday, insisting that "Measles is a disease to be taken seriously."

A case of measles has been traced to a guest who stayed at the SkyCity Hotel. Public health officials are tracing people who may have been exposed to the infected person who was taking part in the annual Firefighter SkyTower Stair Challenge and stayed at the hotel from 22-24 May 2105. The health scare extends to people who may have come in contact with the virus at the wider SkyCity complex and the nearby Mexican cafe.

Auckland Regional Public Health Service is urging anyone who visited the affected locations and is not sure if they are immune to measles to check with their general practitioner. Anyone who was at the locations listed and is not immune or is unsure should isolate themselves at home from 29 May until 7 Jun 2015. The initial symptoms of measles include a fever, running nose, cough and sore eyes. After about 4 days, a raised red rash spreads over the body lasting several days.

Chief medical officer Don Mackie says there are a large number of people from all over the country who may have been exposed to the highly infectious and potentially serious disease.
