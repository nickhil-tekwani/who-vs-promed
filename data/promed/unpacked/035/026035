A diarrhea epidemic, now ravaging children in Cebu towns, is only the
latest in outbreaks that periodically [illustrate unmet human needs, such
as contaminated water and inadequate food. The epidemic erupted mid-May in
the southern towns of Alcoy & Boljoon. This week, the provincial governor
confirmed 145 cases and two deaths.
Another 78 cases of gastroenteritis flared in the northern town of Daan
Bantayan, the governor added, but these cases weren't cholera. Drugs to
combat the epidemic have been sent on.
