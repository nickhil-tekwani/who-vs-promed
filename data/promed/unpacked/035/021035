Oaxaca is on alert due to an outbreak of hepatitis
-----------------------------------------
Tomas Chinas Santiago, the head of Health Jurisdiction No.5 in the Mixteca region, announced that this institute is dealing with 6 outbreaks [of hepatitis] which have been reported in its area of responsibility, in the municipalities of San Miguel, Monteverde, [Huajuapan], Santiago Tamazola, El Oro Nuxaa, Santiago Yosondua, and Santa Cruz. It is fulfilling its responsibilities in conjunction with the population of the [affected] areas in order to avoid complications. He stated that in follow-up to these reports, they had conducted an active search for cases, collecting specimens [from suspected cases] for confirmation, and met with parents of families to explain the disease and preventive measures.

In addition, he mentioned they had inspected water sources and storage facilities, food delivery services in the affected neighbourhoods and schools where appropriate, reviewed sanitary facilities (classrooms and bathrooms), and provided instruction on the hygienic handling of foods, hand washing, and water chlorination.

Chinas Santiago urged local inhabitants to maintain a basic level of hygiene in their households in order to prevent the spread of hepatitis A [virus infection], which is primarily transmitted by the fecal-oral route, whereby a susceptible individual consumes foods or water that have been contaminated with feces from an infected individual.

He stated also that hepatitis A virus can be transmitted by close physical contact. The incubation period can be between 14 and 28 days, and prevention is the key to avoidance of this disease. "Symptoms can present as fever, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, dark urine, yellow tinged skin or yellowing of the whites of the eyes."

Chinas Santiago emphasized that the population should not lower its guard against hepatitis A which can be avoided only by strict adherence to preventive measures. Anyone presenting with acute symptoms should go to the nearest Health Center immediately for attention.

"The population should always wash their hands with soap and water; have adequate access to water for human consumption; food should be cooked or fried thoroughly, especially seafood; and raw foods, such as fruit and vegetables, should be thoroughly washed and stored in receptacles disinfected with chlorinated water.

[Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. The disease is closely associated with a lack of safe water, inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms and fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure), which is associated with high mortality. Hepatitis A occurs sporadically and in epidemics worldwide, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences. Every year there are an estimated 1.4 million cases of hepatitis A worldwide.

The outbreak in Oaxaca appears to be extensive involving many communities, but no quantisation is provided. Curiously this statement does not mention that hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease.

The city and municipality of Oaxaca de Juarez, or simply Oaxaca, is the capital and largest city of the Mexican state of the same name (Oaxaca). It is located in the Centro District in the Central Valleys region of the state, in the foothills of the Sierra Madre at the base of the Cerro del Fortan extending to the banks of the Atoyac River. This city relies heavily on tourism. Tourists to the area should consider the desirability of vaccination before travel.
