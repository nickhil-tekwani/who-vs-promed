Foot and mouth livestock disease found in Unity state
-----------------------------------------------------
Unity state [southern Sudan] is suffering from outbreaks of black quarter
and foot and mouth diseases [FMD], which affect cattle and livestock,
according to the state minister of animals, resources and fisheries,
Colonel Samuel Lony Geng.

The diseases are thought to be located in Mayom County in Unity state. The
area has been cut off during recent heavy rains that prevented road access.
Geng said his ministry had sent veterinarian teams with drugs to
investigate and attempt to stop the spread of the disease. Unity State
recently received a video camera, recorders, drugs, and clothes to be used
in the field by the southern regional government.

The 10 Southern Sudan states are on planning on providing capacity training
for all staff. Geng said his ministry is preparing to send 13 members of
staff to Rumbek [Lakes state] for co-management of the training on 11 Oct 2010.

FMD is endemic in Sudan; information on the serotype, currently
circulating, deserves to be updated. According to the Sudan page on the
WRLFMD (Pirbright) website, the following serotypes have been last
reported: O (2008), SAT1 (1976), A (2006), SAT2 (2008). For additional
information, see <http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/sud.htm>.

Black quarter, also called blackleg, is an acute, febrile disease of cattle
and sheep caused by _Clostridium chauvoei_, characterized by emphysematous
swelling, usually in the heavy muscles. It is found worldwide. Blackleg is
not included in OIE's list of notifiable diseases. Neither disease is
zoonotic - Mod.AS]
