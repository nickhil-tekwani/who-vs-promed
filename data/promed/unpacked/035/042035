A 13 year old adolescent boy was admitted to hospital in Santa Fe province after he was seen for what appeared to be hemorrhagic fever, a disease which can be fatal if is not treated in time, it was officially announced.

This new case occurred in the Perez locality, next to Rosario, and adds to the other "2 people who, having a series of symptoms, have been treated preventively," for the same disease, said the health secretary of this community, Roberto Cantero. "The boy has responded favorably to treatment and his parents were given preventive measures," said [Cantero]. The 3 people in whom hemorrhagic fever was diagnosed in the Perez locality, he added "live near the city peripheral area."

Last month [July 2012] a construction worker who had been affected by the disease was treated in the Rosario Centenario Hospital, where he recovered.

Hemorrhagic fever is caused by an agent known as Junin virus. This is a very serious disease that begins like an influenza infection, but progresses up to death in 2 weeks if it is not treated early with blood plasma from patients who have recuperated from the disease. The incubation period of the virus [infection] is 10 to 12 days, after which the 1st symptoms appear, which are fever, headache, weakness, and depression. The infection is acquired through contact with skin, mucosa, or usually, through inhalation of particulates [of excrement, saliva, or urine) that contain the virus.

[This is the 2nd case of Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) reported by ProMED-mail during the past 3 weeks in the Perez area of Santa Fe Province. The above report indicated that a total of 3 people have been diagnosed with AHF. As indicated in ProMED-mail archive no.2 0120729.1219090 that reported the last AHF case in 27 Jul 2012, the hosts of Junin virus are rodents, particularly _Mus musculus_, _Calomys spp_. and _Akodon azarae_. The animals have a chronic, asymptomatic infection and shed virus through saliva, urine, and blood. Human infections occurs through contact with skin, mucosa, and inhalation of [aerosolized] particles carrying the virus.

According to the GIDEON database, most cases of this vaccine-preventable disease occur in Cordoba, Buenos Aires, and Santa Fe provinces, and the peak year was 1964 with over 3000 cases, with 120 cases in each of 1993 and 1994. Prevention of human cases is the same as for hantaviruses: avoidance of activities that result in contact with aerosols in areas where the rodent hosts are present.
