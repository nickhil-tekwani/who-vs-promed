Queensland has confirmed it is managing a new hendra virus case in a horse in Queensland.

A press release issued this afternoon [Fri 26 May 2017] said the positive test result from the horse in the Gold Coast Hinterland area had been received last night [Thu 25 May 2017].

Queensland Chief Biosecurity Officer Dr Jim Thompson said one horse had been euthanized on the property after rapid deterioration. "Tracing and risk assessments are being undertaken on any animals that may have had contact with the infected horse to work out if further testing needs to be done," Dr Thompson said. "We will work with the property owners to ensure the risk is contained on the property."

Queensland Health's public health experts are assessing the situation today [Fri 26 May 2017] to determine if any humans had contact with the infected horse and will provide any assistance, treatment or testing as the case unfolds.

Dr Thompson said this was the 1st case of hendra virus in Queensland this year [2017]. "Hendra virus infection can occur throughout the year, so it's important that horse owners take steps to protect themselves and their animals at all times," he said.

"Vaccination is the single most effective way of reducing the risk of hendra virus infection in horses. It is recommended that horse owners speak to their veterinarian about vaccinating their horses. "

The deceased horse had not been vaccinated for hendra virus.

"If a horse becomes sick, owners should contact their veterinarian immediately. People in contact with horses need to remember to continue to practice good biosecurity and personal hygiene measures even if a horse is vaccinated against Hendra virus."

[Hendra virus is a zoonotic disease and has killed people, as well as horses. The virus has resulted in an exposed dog being euthanized in an abundance of caution to prevent the family from possible exposure.

This article states vaccination is the single most effective way to protect your horses, and it likely helps build a barrier between the disease and humans. - Mod.TG
