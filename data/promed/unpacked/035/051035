[1] USA: 1st omicron patient

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/10/new-cdc-data-shows-first-known-omicron-patient-in-us-had-symptoms-starting-nov-15.html


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday [10 Dec 2021] said the 1st known case of omicron COVID in the USA was found in a person who had traveled internationally and started presenting symptoms on 15 Nov 2021.

The new infection timeline means omicron arrived in the USA earlier than first thought. California had reported what was believed to be the 1st confirmed case on 1 Dec 2021. An international traveler returned to San Francisco from South Africa on 22 Nov 2021, developed symptoms 3 days later and tested positive on 29 Nov 2021.

The CDC said 22 states have confirmed at least one omicron case, and some of those cases indicate community spread is underway. Among 43 omicron COVID patients, 33% reported international travel during the 14 days before symptom onset or testing positive, according to the CDC.

Case investigations have identified exposures associated with international and domestic travel, large public events and household transmission. One vaccinated person was hospitalized for 2 days, but there haven't been any deaths reported to date among the patients who have been followed by health officials, according to the CDC.

Among the cases, 58% of the patients were between 18 and 39 years of age, and 79% were fully vaccinated at least 14 days before symptom onset or testing positive. Fourteen people had received booster doses and 6 had recovered from previous COVID infections, according to the CDC. Five received their booster dose fewer than 14 days before symptom onset.

The most common reported symptoms were cough, fatigue and congestion, or a runny nose. "Many of the 1st reported cases of omicron variant infection appear to be mild, although as with all variants, a lag exists between infection and more severe outcomes, and symptoms would be expected to be milder in vaccinated persons and those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection than in an unvaccinated person," the CDC said in its weekly Morbidity and Mortality report on Friday [10 Dec 2021; http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7050e1].

The World Health Organization has said the omicron variant appears to be more contagious than the predominant delta variant, though more data are needed for conclusive answers. White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci has said early reports of mild symptoms are encouraging, though more data are needed to determine the possible severity of health outcomes.

The UK Health Security Agency warned on Wednesday [8 Dec 2021] that the spread of the omicron variant is widening, eclipsing the previous delta one. Health Secretary Sajid Javid told British lawmakers that omicron infections in the UK could top one million by year-end.

[2] Denmark: omicron surge

Denmark is seeing the number of people infected with the omicron variant of COVID-19 double every 2nd day, offering a glimpse of a development that is probably unfolding throughout Europe.

The Nordic country can offer valuable insights into what to expect from omicron, as it has Europe's most rigorous screening program, with a high level of testing, and variant screening of all positive PCR tests. That explains why Denmark has reported the highest number of omicron cases in the European Union, Troels Lillebaek, chair of the Danish SARS-CoV-2 variant assessment committee, said.

"Denmark is not a hotspot for omicron compared with any other European country," Lillebaek said in an interview on Friday [10 Dec 2021]. "I'm quite sure that what we are seeing now in Denmark is also happening in neighboring countries, and in other European countries."

The 1st omicron infection in Denmark was detected in a sample from 22 Nov 2021. Since then, 1280 cases have been recorded, and omicron represented 4.5% to 5% of all COVID-19 infections in the country at the beginning of this week [6 Dec 2021].

While based on limited data that could be skewed, the information from Statens Serum Institut also shows that almost 75% of those infected by omicron had received 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine.

"You would like that number to be lower," Lillebaek said. "Then again, it's important to know that testing positive doesn't necessarily mean that there's no effect when it comes to severe disease or admissions to hospital."

Lab studies conducted by vaccine manufacturers Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE have indicated that a 3rd dose may restore protection against the omicron variant. Still, the Danish data show more than 100 omicron cases were discovered among the 19.3% of Danes who have received booster shots.

Abstract
--------
In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, simple, rapid, point-of-care tests not requiring trained personnel for primary care testing are essential. Saliva-based antigen rapid tests (ARTs) can fulfill this need, but these tests require overnight-fasted samples; without which independent studies have demonstrated sensitivities of only 11.7 to 23.1%. Herein, we report an Amplifed Parallel ART (AP-ART) with sensitivity above 90%, even with non-fasted samples. The virus was captured multimodally, using both anti-spike protein antibodies and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. It also featured 2 parallel flow channels. The first contained spike protein binding gold nanoparticles which produced a visible red line upon encountering the virus. The second contained signal amplifying nanoparticles that complex with the former and amplify the signal without any linker. Compared to existing dual gold amplification techniques, a limit of detection of one order of magnitude lower was achieved (0.0064 ng/mL). AP-ART performance in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva of COVID-19 patients was investigated using a case-control study (139 participants enrolled and 162 saliva samples tested). Unlike commercially available ARTs, the sensitivity of AP-ART was maintained even when non-fasting saliva was used. Compared to the gold standard reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing on nasopharyngeal samples, non-fasting saliva tested on AP-ART showed a sensitivity of 97.0% (95% CI: 84.7-99.8); without amplification, the sensitivity was 72.7% (95% CI: 83.7-94.8). Thus, AP-ART has the potential to be developed for point-of-care testing, which may be particularly important in resource-limited settings, and for early diagnosis to initiate newly approved therapies to reduce COVID-19 severity.

["Several studies have found that saliva may in fact harbour a higher viral load than nasopharyngeal secretions (32). However, a key limitation of saliva samples is that it is readily diluted after food or water ingestion that limits diagnostic test performance. ...The amplification step in (the assay described in this study) was able to overcome this dilutional effect for sustained high level sensitivity, and thus underscores the potential of AP-ART to be applied for point-of-care diagnosis." This is a big advantage to this assay. - Mod.LK]

[4] Vaccine development

Arrival of the highly-mutated omicron variant is a wake-up call to develop vaccines less susceptible to the rapid changes of the coronavirus, leading virologists and immunologists told Reuters.

Most 1st-generation COVID-19 vaccines target the spike protein on the outer surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus used to infect human cells. Omicron has prompted alarm among scientists because it has far more mutations than earlier variants, including more than 30 on its spike.

Research to determine whether omicron will evade protection from existing vaccines or prior infection is underway.

Even if current shots remain effective for now, the dramatic evolution of the virus highlights the need for vaccines targeting parts of the virus less prone to mutate.

"One thing that is clear from omicron is that the virus... is not going to go away," said Dr. Larry Corey, a virologist at Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center who is overseeing U.S. government-backed COVID-19 vaccine trials. "There's a need for better vaccines."

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the coronavirus has morphed several times including into the more transmissible, globally dominant delta variant. Still, COVID-19 vaccines have largely maintained their ability to protect people against severe illness and death.

As rapid response tools, the current COVID-19 vaccines are "outstanding," said Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), an international coalition formed to prepare for infectious disease threats that has invested in many COVID-19 vaccines.

But more work -- and money -- is needed to manage the long-term risk. In March [2021], CEPI called for $200 million in funding to develop vaccines that offer broad protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants, and other viruses in the same family such as MERS and SARS.

"We need to keep investing as a hedge against a future that we can't predict," Hatchett said.

World Health Organization chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said on Friday [3 Dec 2021] at the Reuters Next conference that next-generation vaccines are needed.

"We're working hard to support that research and development," Swaminathan said.

Most of the leading COVID-19 vaccines exclusively target parts of the spike protein that provoke strong immune responses, representing an early bet aimed at blocking infection.

The most dramatic of these are the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, which initially had 95% efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19, far exceeding expectations. Their success has added billions in revenue and valuations for developers Pfizer and German partner BioNTech and Moderna.

An exception are COVID-19 vaccines produced in China by Sinovac Biotech and state-owned Sinopharm, which use an inactivated version of the whole SARS-CoV-2 virus, instead of singling out specific genes. Early studies suggested that antibody protection from those vaccines wanes rapidly, and protection may be limited in the elderly.

French biotech Valneva, whose vaccine uses an inactivated version of the whole SARS-CoV-2 virus, in October [2021] said its shot outperformed AstraZeneca's, which targets the spike protein.

More recently, a British study showed Valneva's was the only shot out of 7 that offered no immunity boost when given after 2 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Valneva's vaccine is under review with the European Union's drug regulator.

For the immediate omicron threat, most companies are working on new versions of their existing vaccines targeting the variant. AstraZeneca said it will soon have initial trial data on a vaccine focused on the beta variant, which shares similarities with omicron.

Several research groups and companies have started work on more broadly protective vaccines, such as those that target parts of the virus too essential for its survival to change. Experts caution it will likely take more than a year and generous funding to succeed.

"It's definitely a worthy effort," said Dr. Dan Barouch, a Harvard vaccine researcher who helped design Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine. "It is not the answer for omicron..., but it is potentially the answer for the next variant."

Moderna is researching how to target parts of the coronavirus less prone to mutate. Such a vaccine would need large-scale clinical trials that take months to complete, company President Stephen Hoge said.

Moderna is working on an omicron-specific version of its vaccine and considering one that could address up to 4 variants.

"Realistically, I don't think those 2nd-generation vaccine approaches are going to come to fruition in the next 6-12 months," Hoge said.

CEPI is providing USD 4.3 million to MigVax Corp, an affiliate of Israel's Migal Galilee Research Institute, which is developing an oral vaccine, and up to USD 5 million to the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization. Both are in early development of potentially variant-proof vaccines.

CEPI is also investing up to USD 26 million to support work on a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine from Gritstone Bio aimed at fighting variants. Gritstone also has backing from the Gates Foundation and the U.S. government, with early-stage trials underway or soon to start.

Said Gritstone CEO Andrew Allen: "It's just a little naive to think that the vaccines that we made in the 1st few hot minutes of the pandemic are the best vaccines that we can make."

[5] Germany: vaccine mandate
Date: Fri 10 Dec 2021

https://m.dw.com/en/germany-approves-covid-vaccine-mandate-for-medical-staff/a-60078690


Germany approves COVID vaccine mandate for medical staff
----------------------------------------
In a first for Germany, medical workers in hospitals and nursing homes will need to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Newly approved rules have also permitted dentists and veterinarians to administer jabs.

Lawmakers in Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, voted on Friday [10 Dec 2021] in favor of updating Germany's infection protection law in a bid to curb the 4th wave of COVID-19 infections in the country.

Among the measures is Germany's first coronavirus vaccine mandate -- currently limited to health workers.

A few hours later, the new measures were given the green light from the upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz's newly inaugurated government has made combating the pandemic a priority, as concerns over a new spike in cases grow as the Christmas holidays draw closer.

The changes include measures aimed at getting people vaccinated and speeding up the booster shot campaign -- and are initially valid until 15 March 2022.

Medical workers in hospitals, nursing homes, doctors' offices, facilities for people with disabilities and other health facilities will now be asked to show proof of vaccination or recovery from COVID-19. Only health workers who can provide a medical reason for not getting the jab will be exempt from the mandate.

Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, who is an epidemiologist, said it was unacceptable that some people at hospitals and care homes are still not vaccinated.

"This vaccine mandate is necessary because it's completely unacceptable that, after 2 years of pandemic, people who have entrusted their care to us are dying unnecessarily in institutions because unvaccinated people work there,'' he said. "We cannot accept this."

Andrew Ullmann, an MP with the Free Democrats (FDP) who are part of the new governing coalition, emphasized that while personal freedom is paramount, "freedom always comes with responsibility."

"We have to be aware that we have a responsibility that comes with the freedom and that responsibility is for other people to be sure that they are safe," Ullmann, who is a physician, told DW. "This means that our hospitals are not overwhelmed by the cases of COVID-19."

German lawmakers are set to debate another, likely more contentious bill in the coming weeks on a vaccine mandate that would apply to everyone.

The new measures also expand who is allowed to vaccinate people against COVID -- expanding the group to include dentists, veterinarians and pharmacists.

The changes to the infection protection law also make it legally possible once again to close bars, clubs, restaurants, and theaters as well as cultural and sporting events.

Hospitals will also receive more financial assistance to help offset the costs of having to cancel surgeries and other procedures due to an influx of COVID-19 patients.

Just over 69% of people in Germany are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus -- short of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's aim of a minimum 75% vaccination rate, and considerably lower than some other European Union countries.

In recent weeks, Germany has logged record-high numbers of new cases. Numerous cases of the omicron variant have also been recorded.

While new infections have started to drop over the past 7 days, hospitals have warned that while the case numbers are falling, the country's hospitalizations will likely peak over the Christmas and New Year holidays.

The number of unvaccinated people has been blamed as a key factor in a surge of new virus cases in recent weeks
