Re: Enterovirus interference: Request for Information
------------------------------------------------------
In the comment to the preceding post the Moderator [CP stated that: "Some
years ago it was an accepted view that live poliovirus vaccines would be
ineffective in underdeveloped countries due to the prevalence of unrelated
enterovirus infections and consequent enteroviral interference. The success
of the WHO polio eradication programme has nullified this hypothesis".
On the contrary, The WHO polio eradication program has done absolutely
nothing to nullify the hypothesis of interference. The program requires the
use of National Immunization Days (NID) in which all children under 5 years
of age are immunized on the same day (or same weekend) with a second NID
4-8 weeks later. NIDs are used, as initially demonstrated in trials in
Mexico by Dr. Sabin, in order to ensure that oral poliovirus vaccine
strains saturate the community, interrupt transmission of other enteric
viruses, and overcome interference from other enteric viruses. Routine
immunization based on age of child, i.e., at 2, 4, 6 months, as in the EPI
program has never been successful in interrupting wild polio transmission
in underdeveloped countries when used on its own.

The Russian experience
------------------------
It is difficult to [document the scientific [basis for the practice of
controlling outbreaks of aseptic meningitis in children by the prophylactic
use of poliovirus vaccine. Nonetheless, the use of poliovaccine against
enteroviral meningitis in the former Soviet Union has [significantly
decreased the risk of disease and [succeded in localizing outbreaks.
Probably this is connected with the [interactions, which exist between
enteroviruses. Indeed this approach has been used [successfully for a long
period of time by physicians in the Far East region of Russia.
