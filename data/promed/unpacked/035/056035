Cattle to be Culled in TB Outbreak
----------------------------
Hundreds of cattle are to be culled at a Scottish farm following
today's emergence of an outbreak of bovine tuberculosis (TB). The
disease was found at a farm near the village of Dolphinton, South
Lanarkshire, close to the boundary with Borders region.
Now the entire heard of 330 cattle will have to be destroyed to
prevent the disease spreading.
The last outbreak in Scotland was reported in 1996, according to the
Scottish Executive. An Executive spokesman said today: "We can
confirm that there has been an outbreak of tuberculosis at a farm
near Dolphinton, Lanarkshire. There is no evidence to suggest that
there are any significant implications for the TB disease status in
Scotland. This should not be seen as any indication that the major
problems being experienced in England and Wales have moved north.
There is no new evidence of wildlife being a vector in TB in
Scotland. There are no perceived human health implications."
The problem has been most evident in the southeast of England and
Wales, where the number of cattle with TB has risen. June figures
showed the number of tuberculosis outbreaks in the southwest, year on
year, was up by 21 percent, while the number of cattle which had to
be slaughtered because of the disease rose by 42 percent.
Many farmers believe badgers are to blame for spreading the disease.

[Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease caused by the
acid-fast, slow-growing, rod-shaped _Mycobacterium bovis_;
transmission to humans constitutes a public health problem.
Aerosol exposure to _M. bovis_ is considered to be the most frequent
route of infection of cattle, but infection by ingestion of
contaminated material also occurs. Characteristic tuberculous
lesions occur most frequently in the lungs and the retropharyngeal,
bronchial, and mediastinal lymph nodes. Lesions can also be found in
the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, on serous membranes, and
in other organs.
It is somewhat difficult to understand why this article says there
are no perceived human health implications when bovine tuberculosis
clearly has zoonotic potential. This article may be implying that
there is no perceived human health implications because the herd was
depopulated, or no one on the farm was exposed. - Mod.TG]
