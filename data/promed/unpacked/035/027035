The Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) Soura has received hundreds of suspected H1N1 influenza patients while 2 deaths have occurred at the hospital in 3 days due to the virus.

According to officials, a 20-year-old pregnant woman from Budgam died on [Tue 24 Oct 2017] and dozens of suspects are awaiting test results due to the shortage of labs.

"The 20-year-old pregnant woman from Budgam was tested positive for H1N1 last week [week of Sun 15 Oct 2017] and she died today [Wed 25 Oct 2017] morning due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome," Medical Superintendent of SKIMS Soura, Dr Amin Tabish, told Kashmir Reader.

The woman's death raised the toll to 2 deaths in the past 3 days at the hospital due to H1N1. The deaths have spread panic among the other patients, especially as there are no sufficient testing facilities at SKIMS.

Dr Tabish said there was no need to panic, as of the many suspected cases received at the hospital in the past week [week of Sun 15 Oct 2017], only 3 tested positive.

"A male patient from Budgam had died last week [week of Sun 15 Oct 2017] while another female was treated successfully and sent back home. Though many people are dropping in the hospital, creating a burden on the facility, but we are prepared to handle any exigency," he said.

According to him, SKIMS has already opened an isolation ward. However, there is no one admitted there yet, he said.

Sources at the hospital said that lack of vaccination creates fear of the virus among people, and that labs are not enough for handling many patients at a time, thereby making the diagnosis difficult.

"In normal days, the lab would test only 8 to 10 samples in a week. However, during panic situation, around 50 samples come in a day," said a senior medico at SKIMS.

Suspected cases are also coming to other tertiary-care hospitals including SMHS, CD hospital, Lal Ded hospital, and GB Pant hospital.

"We have tested many patients with H1N1-like symptoms in a month. However, no one has been tested positive," said Dr Naveed Nazir, HoD of Chest Medicine department.

Other hospitals, especially GB Pant and SMHS, are facing problems because the lab established at CD Hospital is unable to send them test reports on time.

Amid rising cases of swine flu patients, the government is also unable to devise a strategy due to delay in confirmation of reports of H1N1 from SKIMS and CD Hospital, where the testing laboratories have been set up.

"Now doctors have asked many people to get the tests done at private labs, which puts extra burden on gullible people," said an administrator.

[It is not clear in the report whether the H1N1 mentioned in the report is Influenza A/H1N1 Pdm 09 or the pre-2009 H1N1 strain, although it is more likely the former, since there have been limited reports of the former strain. A/H1N1 Pdm 09 is a seasonal influenza virus, a representative strain for which is included in the seasonal influenza vaccine on annual basis. However, there have been reports of increased cases from various parts of India during the inter-seasonal, traditionally low transmission period.

There is need for surveillance of circulating seasonal influenza viruses on a continuous basis to establish seasonality trends, understand their epidemiology as well as to detect early any unusual surge or mortality in respiratory illness associated with influenza. - Mod.UBA
