The New Jersey departments of Health (NJDOH), Environmental Protection (NJDEP), and Agriculture (NJDA) are urging state residents to take precautions this summer to protect themselves from all mosquito-borne diseases including eastern equine encephalitis [EEE], a rare virus transmitted to people and horses by the bite of an infected mosquito.

The DOH has confirmed the 1st human case of EEE this summer in an elderly Somerset County man earlier this month [August 2019]. The man was hospitalized but has been discharged for continued rehabilitation care.

To date, EEE [virus] has been detected in 22 mosquito samples and in 3 horses in the southern and eastern parts of the state.

Most persons infected with EEE [virus] have no apparent illness, but some can be very ill. Severe cases of EEE (involving encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain) begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting 4-10 days after a mosquito bite. The illness may then progress to disorientation, seizures, or coma.

EEE is one of the most severe mosquito-transmitted diseases in the US. About 1/3 of people with [neuroinvasive] EEE die from the disease, and there is significant brain damage in most survivors. While there is a vaccine for horses, there is no vaccine for people.

Reducing exposure to mosquitoes is the best defense against infection:
- Use repellent: When outdoors, use insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin and/or clothing. The repellent/insecticide permethrin can be used on clothing to protect through several washes. Always follow package directions. Insect repellent should not be used on children less than 2 months old, and oil of lemon eucalyptus should not be used on children less than 3 years;
- Wear protective clothing: Wear long sleeves/pants when weather permits; and
- Install and repair screens: Have secure, intact screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out; use air conditioning if you have it.

[This summer [2019], EEE virus transmission season has been an active one in the USA. Although most reported cases of EEE this year [2019] have occurred in horses, there have been several recent human cases as well. Individuals living in areas where human or equine EEE cases have occurred should heed the above recommendations to prevent mosquito bites. Avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available. Fortunately, horses can be vaccinated, but there is no vaccine available for humans. - Mod.TY
