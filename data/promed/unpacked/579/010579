New case of bird flu detected in rural area
-----------------------------------------------
Another case of avian flu in birds has been confirmed in Egypt.
Ministry of Health officials and World Health Organization (WHO)
staff said on Wednesday [27 Sep 2006] that a case of H5N1 (avian flu)
in birds was detected in a house near Aswan, in Upper Egypt. WHO
spokesman Hassan el-Bushra told IRIN that the infected animals,
raised in the backyard of a house in the town of Edfu, have now been
culled. Ministry of Health officials have "instigated the
WHO-approved control measures, and no human infection has been
reported," he said. Animals within a one-km radius of the site of
infection have been culled and removed for sterile burial.
This year [2006], Egypt suffered the worst outbreak of avian flu
outside Asia. The disease was largely brought under control, although
fears remained of a new outbreak. The 1st announcements of avian flu
cases among poultry in the country were made in mid-February 2006.
This led to the culling of at least 20 million birds nationwide from
that time to May 2006, when alarm over the disease dissipated among the public.
14 human cases of bird flu have been found in Egypt since mid-March
2006, al-Bushra said. Of these, 6 have died. The last was a
75-year-old woman who died on 18 May 2006. Specialists say that the
overwhelming majority of human cases in Egypt have been women who
were infected by domestically-kept birds.
Soon after the announcement of the 1st cases of bird infections, a
law was passed banning domestic breeding in urban areas. Health
authorities did not push for similar restrictions in rural areas,
however, where domestic breeding is more widespread and economically
vital. "A ban [in rural areas] would lead many to conceal their
birds, heightening the danger rather than quelling it," said health
ministry press spokesman Abdel Rahman Shahine at the time. "Instead,
we're working to help them increase awareness to prevent the
emergence of new cases."
Although health authorities sought to assure the public through
various awareness campaigns that the consumption of cooked chicken
was risk-free throughout the crisis, the collapse in demand and the
mass culling combined brought the poultry industry to a standstill.
Infections among birds were found in 20 of the country's 26
governorates, according to the health ministry, and until the latest
case on Wednesday [27 Sep 2006], the situation was presumed to be
under control. However, faced with the continued prospect of the
virus mutating into a new, more dangerous form, health authorities
have maintained safety measures. "Until the last virus is eradicated,
the risk continues to exist," said al-Bushra.
