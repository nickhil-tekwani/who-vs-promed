In June 2015, state officials confirmed a case of chronic wasting disease in a Medina County deer-breeding facility, making it the farthest east in Texas the disease has been reported. In an effort to keep people informed about the disease, the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service and Llano County AgriLife Extension Service are hosting a program 26 Oct 2015 on the situation.

"Chronic wasting disease is a condition that affects the nervous system of deer, elk and moose," said John Tomecek, a Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service Wildlife Specialist in San Angelo. He's one of the program presenters. "It is similar to diseases such as scrapie in seep and goats and bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE in cattle. There is no evidence chronic wasting disease can be transmitted to sheep, goats, cattle or humans."

Wildlife scientists initially detected the disease in a captive mule deer herd in Colorado in 1967. Since then, the disease has been confirmed in 22 states and 2 Canadian provinces. The 1st reported Texas case was in 2012 in a free-range mule deer in the Hueco Mountains of West Texas. State officials have confirmed at least 3 more cases of the disease linked back to the Medina County facility. The latest was in August in South Texas, but the deer was raised at the Medina County ranch where the initial case in June 2015 was detected.

In August 2015, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the Texas Animal Health Commission established new rules for breeders before they could sell or transport deer. Before the new rules, the state had banned the transfer of deer since July 2015.

During the 26 Oct 2015 program, people will learn about the disease from its history to clinical signs to prevention techniques. Whether someone is a landowner, a hunter or a deer enthusiast, the program will be worth attending, organizers said. Along with Tomecek, Clayton Wolf, the TPWD wildlife division director, will talk about the disease. The program will take place in St. James Lutheran Church's Schorlemmer Hall, 1401 Ford St. in Llano, TX. Registration starts at 5:30 p.m. followed by the program at 6 p.m.

Organizers ask that people RSVP to the Llano County AgriLife Extension Service office by 22 Oct 2015. Call (325) 247-5159 to RSVP.

[To find Medina County, go to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/texas_90.jpg; it is immediately west of San Antonio.

This is a very worrying situation, as this deer ranch in Medina County appears to be shedding new cases. Readers should realise that West Texas, i.e., from south of San Antonio to the NW of that city, is the heart of the Texas deer environment and hunting ranches. Up until the mid-1950s it was the major area in the world for sheep wool production. Unfortunately there was a bad drought, it was severely overgrazed, and then invaded by mesquite. Now they raise white-tail deer for "hunting." Until recently CWD was restricted to an area in the far west of the state, north of El Paso. I thoroughly encourage any and all interested and concerned with this disease in Texas to attend this 26 Oct 2015 meeting. - Mod.MHJ
