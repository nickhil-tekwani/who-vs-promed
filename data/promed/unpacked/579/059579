A woman has dug into her own pockets to get to the bottom of why so many ducks are dying at a Bethany pond. "They're all gone," said [the woman]. "Including what we lost in June [2016], we're up to 80. I decided to take 2 bodies to Oklahoma State University and have a necropsy done. They determined it was the duck plague."

A herpes virus wiped out the entire breed, and the disease could be passed on and carried by other birds. "It's not the bird flu. It's not going to affect people," [she] said. "You can come and enjoy the pond. It's not going to affect your dog or cat."

The report lifts her suspicion that someone had been poisoning the ducks. [She] is now looking to the city to help protect other birds. "I'm still afraid. I don't want these ducks to die. I didn't want the other ducks to die," she said.

Bethany officials said they have plans to make upgrades to the park and pond later this year [2017].

[Duck viral enteritis (also known as "duck plague") is an acute disease caused by a herpesvirus that infects Anseriformes (ducks, geese and swan). It is of economic importance as it can affect commercial waterfowl. It is characterized by vascular damage, tissue hemorrhages, digestive mucosal eruptions, lesion of lymphoid organs and degenerative changes in parenchymatous organs.

The disease is distributed worldwide, and it was 1st diagnosed in the USA in January 1967 in pekin ducks on commercial duck farms in Long Island (New York). Within 1 month, it was confirmed in a free-ranging mute swan (_Cygnus olor_) using a lagoon associated with these farms. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in over 20 states. - Mod.PMB
