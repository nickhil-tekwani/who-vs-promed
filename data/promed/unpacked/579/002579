After 53 days, a 23-year-old Nipah patient hailing from Ernakulam was discharged from Kochi Aster Medcity on Tuesday [23 Jul 2019]. Kerala health minister KK Shailaja congratulated the medical team at the hospital for successfully handling the Nipah case. KK Shailaja on Tuesday [23 Jul 2019] officially declared the district Nipah-free.

The Aster Medcity had borne all expenses of the Nipah patient. On 4 Jun [2019], Pune's National Institute of Virology confirmed that the 23-year old youth had contracted the Nipah virus. The youth was admitted to hospital on 30 May [2019] and was in no condition to stand on his feet. He has now completely recovered.

A year ago, the Nipah virus had claimed 18 lives in Kozhikode, Kerala. Unlike last year [2018], no loss of life has been reported so far in 2019. Health minister KK Shailaja is expected to be present during the discharge of the youth.

Meanwhile, the National Institute of Virology has identified the presence of the deadly Nipah virus in 12 fruit bats out of the 36 samples tested at the institute. The medical department had collected hundreds of sputum samples of fruit bats from different parts of Kerala.

Training on preventive measures to avoid contracting the virus was imparted to 1293 persons in the state. The labour department inspected 12 migrant labour camps at North Paravur, Perumbavur, and Kakkanad areas to ensure hygiene standards were met. Strict action will be taken against those found violating hygiene norms, a health department official had said.

Accordingly, training that was imparted at the block level as part of a Nipah vigil will cover gram panchayats and municipalities. The workers of Asha, Anganwadi, Kudumbasree, and NREGP also received training.

[It is good to learn that the young man has completely recovered from his Nipah virus infection and has been discharged from the hospital. His is the 2nd case of Nipah virus infection [NVI] in Kerala state this year (2019). Last year (2018), as of 17 Jul 2018, a total of 19 Nipah virus (NiV) cases, including 17 deaths, were reported from Kerala state: 18 of the cases were laboratory confirmed, and the deceased index case was suspected to have NVI but could not be tested. The 2018 outbreak was localized to 2 districts in Kerala state: Kozhikode and Malappuram. The exact circumstances under which this or the previous confirmed Nipah virus index case acquired their infections are not stated in the above or in previous reports, nor is it stated whether these individuals had contact with flying fox fruit bats (_Pteropus giganteus_), the reservoir hosts of Nipah virus, or fruit that the bats may have contaminated. It is interesting to note that 12 of 36 fruit bats tested at the National Institute of Virology were positive for Nipah virus. Although Kerala health minister KK Shailaja officially declared Ernakulam district Nipah-free, it may be free of human cases currently but is unlikely to be free of the virus in _Pteropus giganteus_ fruit bats.
