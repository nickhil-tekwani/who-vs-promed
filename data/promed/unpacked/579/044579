SALMONELLOSIS, PERSON-TO-PERSON SPREAD - USA (IOWA)

A germ usually carried by contaminated food is apparently spreading from
person to person in the Burlington, Iowa area, doctors say. Rumors that
restaurants are to blame are keeping some people home for dinner.
Salmonellosis has sickened more than 20 residents in the past 3 weeks, said
Dr. Patricia Quinlisk, state epidemiologist. The most common symptom has
been severe diarrhea. About 6 people have been hospitalized.
Such infection is most commonly associated with undercooked chicken or
eggs. Usually, the people who are sickened have eaten the affected foods.
In this case, Quinlisk said, the bacteria apparently are traveling directly
from person to person. Quinlisk said she'd heard of such infections
elsewhere, but never in Iowa. The outbreak is unusual enough that federal
health authorities are considering writing a national article about it.
Quinlisk said investigators haven't tracked down the source of the
outbreak, but acknowledged that health authorities are helping train
restaurant workers to keep the sickness from spreading. Some restaurants
are reporting a drop in business. "People are scared to go out and eat,"
said Conrado Espinoza, owner of Lindo Mexico, a downtown cafe.
The best way to stop the outbreak is for people to wash their hands
thoroughly, Quinlisk said.

[Burlington, Iowa is located in the southeastern part of the state on the
Mississippi River.
This cluster of cases is not described adequately enough in the posting to
surmise whether direct person-to-person spread of the organism (or
organisms) is a reasonable possibility. Whether this is a point source
cluster (from a specific food or facility) that subsequently caused
secondary cases in the community is also not clear.
Despite the relatively large number of organisms generally needed to
transmit the infection (ID50 = 5 logs or more), person-to-person
transmission of both _S. typhi_ and the nontyphoid salmonellae have both
been reported. A number of nosocomial outbreaks are cited below. As
indicated in the posting, inadequate hand washing is likely to be a common
thread especially associated with a recipient who has lower than normal
levels of gastric acidity that may lower the ID50 of the organism.
