The GPEI extends its sincere condolences to Dr Fikri's family and his many colleagues and friends throughout WHO and the EMRO Region.
- Reports of an attack that destroyed a UNICEF-supported vaccine cold room in Mayadeen district, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, Syria are currently being verified.
- Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Afghanistan: 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case reported from Nangarhar province; 2 new wild poliovirus 1 (WPV1) positive environmental samples reported, one from Hilmand and one from Kandahar provinces.

Afghanistan
-----------
- One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case has been confirmed, received from Batikot district in Nangarhar province. Paralysis onset was on [15 Sep 2017]. This raises the total number of WPV1 cases in 2017 to 7 in Afghanistan, and 12 worldwide. The case occurred in a child aged 15 months, who had received 1 dose of IPV previously.
- A response vaccination campaign is currently being implemented for the new polio case, targeting about 150 000 children in 5 districts of the eastern region. The next sub-national immunization days are planned during the 1st half of November 2017.
- 2 new wild poliovirus 1 (WPV1) positive environmental samples were also reported in the past week. One sample was collected on [26 Sept 2017] from Lashkargah district, Hilmand province; and the other on [26 Sep 2017] from Kandahar district, in Kandahar province.

Pakistan
--------
- 3 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) positive environmental samples were reported in the last week. Two samples were collected on [2 Oct 2017], and are from Balochistan province, 1 from Kabdullah district, and another from Pishin district. The 3rd sample was collected on [3 Oct 2017], and is from Sindh province, Karachi Orangi district.
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of Pakistan WPV1 cases in 2017 remains 5.
- Vaccination campaign in response to the last polio case and new positive environmental samples has concluded. The next sub-national immunization days are planned towards the end of October 2017. The National and provincial EOCs are providing extensive field support ahead of the October SNIDs, on microplans validation with special focus on reaching and vaccinating the high risk mobile populations. Locally appropriate social mobilization is also underway in key high areas of the country.

Nigeria
-------
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno.
- Nigeria continues to implement an emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).
- Detection of polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission. As part of the emergency response, subnational surveillance continues to be strengthened.
- The next scheduled SIA activity will take place at the beginning of November [2017], using bOPV vaccine to protect over 10 million children under the age of 5 from polio.

Lake Chad Basin
---------------
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno state, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto states in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons camps, and at international borders.
- Microplanning continues to strengthen future SIA activities, taking into account new districts as they become accessible.
- A large livestock vaccination campaign targeting international nomads is planned for the end of November 2017.
- Preparations continue for the 2nd Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) for the region, scheduled from [1 to 10 Nov 2017].

Central Africa
--------------
- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo).
- The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year is 9, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (7 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on [27 Jul 2017]); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on [26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017], with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on [2 May 2017]).
- Outbreak response continues to take place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.
- The next immunisation activities are scheduled for the end of October 2017, using bOPV vaccine to immunise over 10 million children.
- Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.
- The country office continues to be supported by HQ to ensure the close analysis and mapping of cases and outbreak response.

Middle East
-----------
- In Syria, 4 new type 2 circulating vaccine-derived polio (cVDPV2) cases have been reported this week. Three of the cases were reported in Mayadeen district, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, with onset [12 Aug 2017, 22 Aug 2017, and 25 Aug 2017].

- WHO and UNICEF have received reports that ongoing violence in Deir Ez-Zor governorate has destroyed a UNICEF-supported vaccine cold room in Mayadeen district, storing more than 100 000 doses of vaccines. While the reports are being verified, plans for urgent provision of essential cold chain equipment have been developed to allow any urgent vaccination activities to continue.
- The 2nd immunization round for Raqqa concluded on [13 Oct 2017]. According to administrative data, a total of 144 414 children aged 0-59 months were vaccinated with mOPV2, and IPV was provided to children aged between 2-23 months in 2 districts, Raqqa and Thawra.

[The take away messages from this week's polio statistics again is good news and not so good news.

The good news includes:
- No additional cases of cVDPV identified in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
- No new WPV1 cases reported from Pakistan or Nigeria (2 of the 3 remaining polio endemic countries).
- Total count of WPV1 cases reported to date in 2017 is 12 compared with 37 cases reported in all of 2016.

The not so good news includes:
- 1 newly confirmed case of WPV1 associated paralytic polio in Afghanistan.
- 2 positive environmental samples for WPV1 in Afghanistan in provinces with no recent WPV1 cases in either province.
- 3 positive environmental samples for WPV1 in Pakistan involving 2 provinces.
- 4 newly confirmed cVDPV2 cases in Deir Ez-Zor governorate, bringing the total number of cVDPV cases reported by Syria to 52. Dates of onset of disease were in late August 2017, so results from AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) surveillance in September 2017 are still pending. An additional isolate from a healthy child was also positive for WPV1.

A map showing the global distribution of all WPV1 associated cases and cVDPV associated cases can be found at http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

In addition to the weekly report of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, there are 2 interesting media reports. In one report, "Amid Fear and Guns, Polio Finds a Refuge" is an excellent overview of the current challenges facing eradication of polio globally with a focus on the challenges of the civil unrest in the 3 remaining polio endemic countries, using primarily Nigeria as the case study location. A lengthy but well thought out article available at: https://undark.org/article/polio-nigeria-boko-haram/. The second article has a focus on Pakistan and the challenges facing vaccination activities there http://www.arabnews.com/node/1180356/world. - Mod.MPP]
