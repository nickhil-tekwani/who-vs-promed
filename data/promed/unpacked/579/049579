The Health Ministry reported that three more people had died of suspected
Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Negri Sembilan. A 40-year old man, who was
the owner of a pig farm in Kampung Sungai Nipah, Bukit Pelandok, Port
Dickson, died at the Tawakal Hospital in Kuala Lumpur yesterday while two
others, also from the village, died on Sunday night at the Seremban
Hospital and the Tawakal Hospital, respectively. This brings to seven the
number of people who have died from suspected JE since Friday 26 February.
As a precautionary measure, three primary schools were closed in Negri
Sembilan yesterday. Another two schools will also be closed today.
At a press conference, Deputy Director-General of Health Datuk Dr Abdul
Aziz Mahmood said that since October last year, there were 4 confirmed JE
deaths out of 25 encephalitis-related deaths in the country. All the 4
confirmed JE deaths were in Perak.
Perak had 26 suspected JE cases of which 12 were confirmed while Negri
Sembilan had 16 suspected cases of which two were confirmed to be JE.
The Ministry of Health Department of Public Health's home page
(<http://dph.gov.my/>http://dph.gov.my) now includes update news on JE in
the country.
