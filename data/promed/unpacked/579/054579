The Center for Sugarcane Technology [CST] in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo
recently announced that their monitoring of sugarcane rust indicates
that the disease has spread far beyond the borders of the state of Sao
Paulo into the states of Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais, Parana, and
Mato Grosso do Sul. Sugarcane [orange] rust was first [reported] in
Brazil in late 2009 [see ProMED-mail post 20100122.0247].

Approximately 80 different varieties of sugarcane are grown in Brazil
and CST is in the process of testing all the varieties for tolerance
to the disease. Most of the varieties appear to be tolerant to the
rust, but 4 varieties, BR 72454, SP 891115, SP 842025, and CV 14,
appear to be highly susceptible to the disease. Unfortunately, these 4
varieties are planted on 12 percent of Brazil's sugarcane acreage. The
researchers recommend that these 4 varieties be eliminated and the
fields be replanted to resistant varieties. That of course is easier
said than done.

[Orange rust of sugarcane caused by the fungus _Puccinia kuehnii_ has
the potential to cause significant economic losses to the crop.
Symptoms include minute, elongated yellow lesions, which develop an
orange to orange-brown colour as they expand. Most rust pustules occur
on the lower leaf surface with more lesions toward the leaf base.
Disease development is favoured by warm, humid summers and cool
autumns, and by rain.

A related species, _P. melanocephala_, causes brown or common rust.
Colour and distribution of leaf lesions vary from orange rust, and
development of this pathogen is inhibited by rain. Both rusts are
rapidly spread by wind, and disease management includes fungicides and
development of resistant cane varieties suitable to local requirements.

In Australia, _P. kuehnii_ had been present for 100 years, but in 2000
a much more virulent strain emerged devastating the then most widely
grown sugarcane cultivar. The disease was reported for the 1st time in
the western hemisphere in 2007 from Florida, USA (see ProMED-mail post
20070731.2457), and it is not clear whether this was a similar
scenario with emergence of a new strain, or whether the pathogen was
actually introduced at that time. Orange rust has been reported since
then from additional countries in the Americas (see ProMED-mail posts
listed below), but it has not yet been clarified whether these reports
represent the same fungal strain. Brazil was put on alert in 2008;
nevertheless, the disease appears now to be widespread in the country.
