So far, 12 positive samples of cattle from 6 different farms in North-Rhine-Westphalia have been confirmed positive for SBV. One case was a twin calf that died 10 days prior to the expected birth date. Virus was detected in the abdominal liquid using the RT-PCR "Schmallenberg test."

In addition, the virus was confirmed in the brains of lambs born with malformations from 14 holdings, 7 located in North-Rhine-Westphalia and the other 7 in Lower Saxony. The malformations are the result of infection of the dam in an early stage of pregnancy during summer/autumn 2011.

The method to detect the virus has meanwhile been distributed to institutions in Belgium, France, The UK, The Netherlands and Italy.

After the discovery of a new Orthobunyavirus, which was provisionally named "Schmallenberg virus," the FLI received numerous requests for virus isolates, protocols of our newly developed and validated in-house real-time RT-PCR, and disclosure of sequence information of the viral genome. After intensive discussion within the FLI, we have decided to forgo applying for patents, etc., as this could adversely affect the disclosure of information crucial to combat this new infection, thereby minimizing the impact on livestock production.

As a federally funded governmental research institute, we feel it is appropriate to supply the virus isolated by us, the protocol for genome detection, and sequence information on the viral genome to all scientists and scientific communities who want to contribute to the understanding of this new infection. Therefore, we are happy to forward this information and reagents for non-commercial and commercial purposes under the conditions laid down in our material exchange document. As far as possible, we will do our best to serve the requests in a timely manner. Sequence information on the viral genome, documented in GenBank, is made available as soon as we have received the necessary access data.

On behalf of the Schmallenberg Virus Research Group at the FLI,

Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. Thomas C. Mettenleiter, President
Dr. Martin Beer, Head of the Institute of Diagnostic Virology

[FLI's decision to make its developed techniques and biologicals -- concerning the diagnosis of the emerging disease SBV -- unconditionally available to the international scientific community is exemplary and deserves to be warmly applauded.

The information included in item 1 above is the 1st notification of SBV-related malformations in sheep in Germany; initially (mild) clinical disease in cattle during August-September 2011 was announced and found to be related to SBV; malformations, attributed to SBV, have been reported, so far, from Netherlands and Belgium. An earlier note on a German calf was included in a DEFRA report. This is also the 1st information of SBV detected beyond North-Rhine-Westphalia, namely in 7 sheep holdings in Lower Saxony, situated north to NRW and similarly bordering the Netherlands (see map at http://www.german-cities.com/images/Lower-Saxony_250-338.jpg).

Additional information on SBV is expected to become available and be discussed during the due meeting of EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH), Section Animal Health and Welfare (Wed 11 and Thu 12 Jan 2012) in Brussels; agenda item 5F is: "Information from Germany and The Netherlands and exchange of views on the Schmallenberg virus infection of ruminants." We are also informed about a French official requirement for notification of malformations in ruminants; details will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
