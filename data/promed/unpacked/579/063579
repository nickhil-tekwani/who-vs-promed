West Nile Virus Antibody-positive Black Bears in New Jersey
-----------------------------------------------------------
A West Nile virus-neutralizing antibody serosurvey was conducted in
Northwest New Jersey during the months of February and March 2002, in
cooperation with the New Jersey Fish and Wildlife Services (FWS). The
samples were collected by NJ FWS, prepped by Rutgers, and analyzed by
CDC in Fort Collins, Colorado.
Out of 51 samples of mostly female adult black bears, 3 were positive
for West Nile virus-neutralizing antibodies. These results warrant
more investigations into the overall ecology of West Nile virus in
the Northeastern United States. A formal account will be published
shortly and presentations will be given at the NMCA and NJMCA
meetings.

[In the year 2000 outbreak 6 wild animals were reported West Nile
virus-positive (2 bats, 1 chipmunk, 1 rabbit, 1 squirrel, and 1
skunk). According to the final surveillance report for the year 2001
outbreak, horses were the only non-human mammals reported West Nile
virus-positive in 2001. Initial reports of West Nile virus infection
of other mammals were not confirmed subsequently. - Mod.CP]
