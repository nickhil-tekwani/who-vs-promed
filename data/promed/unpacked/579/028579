Health officials say 17 cases of whooping cough have been confirmed in
eastern South Dakota and are tied to Madison Elementary in Huron, where 10
of the cases have been reported. Another 7 cases were reported in Lake
Preston. Health officials say the cases involve children appropriately
vaccinated for their ages, though they note that youngsters are not fully
immunized until 4 to 6 years of age, and they emphasized the need for
booster shots due to the fact that immunity wanes over time.

[The ages of the affected children are not stated [Madison Elementary in
Huron serves pre-kindergarten to 5th grade. - Mod.SH]. Immunity to the
infection begins to wane in adolescence and is the reason pertussis vaccine
boosters are now recommended for 11-12 year olds as well as once in
adulthood. Usually a relatively mild disease in this age group resulting in
a chronic cough, infection in this age group can function as a reservoir to
infect not yet adequately immunized infants, who have a substantial
morbidity and mortality from pertussis.

Huron is in Beadle County in east-central South Dakota, which is in the
north-central USA. The town and county can be found on a map at
