Experts are closely monitoring 5 people at an isolation center set up in Mubende district. This was after a patient succumbed to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF).

The 35-year old man was first recorded at a clinic in district with high fever and persistent vomiting. When his symptoms did not subside after a few days of treatment, he was on [23 May 2018] referred to Mubende Regional Referral Hospital.

On arrival, several tests were carried out and turned out negative. Suspicious health officials placed the patient in the isolation center from where he received intravenous fluids. He died in the wee hours of the night he was admitted.

Dr Sarah Opendi, the Minister of Health in charge of General Duties told The Independent that samples from the patient tested at the Uganda Virus Research Institute revealed he had succumbed to CCHF. The incident immediately triggered the standard hemorrhagic fever response, including monitoring of known contacts of the dead patients.

A national rapid response team was dispatched to Mubende to collect more information and assist the district to mount an appropriate response that included orientating health workers on how to carefully handle suspected patients.

Staff members of the hospital who got in contact with the dead patient were given digital thermometers and instructed to record their body temperatures twice daily to capture any changes in a timely manner.

Mortality rate from Crimean-Congo, according to experts is approximately 30 percent, with death occurring in the 2nd week of illness. But whenever it is confirmed, there is panic.

When it broke out early this year [2018] in Nakaseke and Luweero districts, there was initially denial. The Ministry of Health dismissed reports by district officials that a 9-year old girl who had died in December [2017] had succumbed to any viral hemorrhagic fever.

But the incident sent a wave of fear among residents and district leaders who demanded a clear explanation by government; especially after 2 other people developed similar symptoms. That is when it was confirmed there was actually an active outbreak.

The disease was first characterised in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It was then later recognised in 1969 as the cause of illness in the Congo, thus resulting in its current name.

CCHF is generally a disease of animals but also attacks herders and other people who come in contact with tick harboring animals. It can also be transmitted human to human through contact with infected blood or other bodily fluids.

Although Crimean-Congo fever behaves somewhat like Ebola hemorrhagic fever which is currently ravaging people in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, Dr Julius Lutwama a virologist at the Uganda Virus Research Institute says the 2 are not in the same viral family as CCHF is a bunyavirus similar to Rift Valley fever which also attacks animals.

Experts say the onset of the disease is sudden, with initial signs and symptoms including headache, high fever, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain, sore throat, and vomiting. As the illness progresses, bleeding eyes, large areas of severe bruising, severe nosebleeds, and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites can be seen, beginning around the 4th day of illness and lasting for about 2 weeks.

Lutwama who heads the Arbovirology, Emerging and Re-emerging Diseases division at the institute says although the disease is not as fatal, recovery is slow whereby improvement generally begins on the 9th or 10th day after the onset of illness. And, treatment is primarily supportive. For him, the best way to go around the illness is working really fast.

"The faster you can get a diagnosis of the fever, the faster you can stop it," he told The Independent, "And the only way to stop it is to break the chain of infection." Lutwama however says CCHF's laboratory diagnosis is made when the infection is in acute stage where they use different techniques to identify the virus through detecting antibodies, the virus RNA or the virus itself. But, even before tests are made, Lutwama says health workers must be able to easily identify a suspected case and put them under surveillance to ensure that the virus does not jump to another person.

The outbreaks that have happened in the country according to Lutwama all confirm one point - that there should be constant surveillance for all the viral hemorrhagic fevers. For now however, the Ministry has embarked on creating awareness and warning people in the cattle corridor districts to use protective wear while slaughtering and handling animals to prevent transmission. They are also advised to use insect repellents that are effective in warding off ticks from exposed skin or clothing. To avoid infection at health facility level, medical workers are advised to use proper infection control precautions to prevent exposure.

Crimean-Congo fever outbreaks
-----------------------------
- 23 May 2018: a 35-year-old man from Nkoko sub-county in Kakumiro district dies at Mubende Regional Referral Hospital.
- December 2017: a 9-year-old girl dies. 2 other people develop symptoms in Nakaseke and Luweero districts.
- 2015: a 33-year-old male admitted to Mengo Hospital in Kampala tested positive for the infection.
- September 2013: a female patient dies in Nansana on the outskirts of Kampala city. The Ministry of Health had just declared that the country was Crimean-Congo fever free.
- August 2013: a farmer in the northern Uganda district of Agago dies. This was the 1st confirmed case after more than 50 years of no reported human CCHF case. 3 others in the same area who had died before this case was confirmed were also suspected to have succumbed to the infection. Around the same time, another case was confirmed at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala.
