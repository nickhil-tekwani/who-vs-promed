The bacterium _Pantoea ananatis_ has been discovered by scientists on rice crops in the Kuttanad region (Alappuzha, Kottayam, Pathanamthitta districts). Previously, the only bacterial blight of rice known to occur in the region was that caused by _Xanthomonas_ spp. [e.g., ProMED post 20211216.8700304].

The researchers warned that it might pose a threat in the future. They said that this is the 1st time this pathogen was found in Kerala and that better understanding of its pathogenicity is required. Effective disease management, including chemical and biological controls, needs to be developed. The exceptional geography of Kuttanad necessitates intense consideration of crop management and economic sustainability.

In India, _Pantoea ananatis_ was found as the cause of leaf blight of rice previously only in northern areas in 2011.

[_Pantoea ananatis_ symptoms in rice may include lesions on stems, stem necrosis and leaf blight. The pathogen has also been reported to cause sheath and grain rot, as well as kernel discolouration. _P. stewartii_, previously known to occur on rice seeds, has also recently been associated with a leaf blight of the crop (ProMED post 20170504.5012251). Both species are considered globally emerging rice pathogens.

The effects of different bacterial strains on hosts can vary dramatically. The bacteria are generally transmitted by insect vectors, plant material and infected seed, making them a quarantine risk.

Species in the genus can cause diseases on a number of crops, such as Stewart's bacterial wilt on maize (_P. stewartii_); leaf blights of cereals, including rice (_P. agglomerans_); pink disease of pineapple (_P. citrea_); brown stalk rot of maize (_P. ananatis_ and a novel _Pantoea_ species); center rot of onion (_P. ananatis_); fruit bronzing of jack fruit (_P. stewartii_ subsp. _stewartii_; a bacterial blight of _Eucalyptus_ and a leaf blotch disease of sudangrass, have also been associated with _Pantoea_ species.

_Xanthomonas oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_ causes another bacterial leaf blight of rice; _Xo_ pv. _oryzicola_ is the causal agent of bacterial leaf streak. For more information on these diseases see previous ProMED posts in the archives.
