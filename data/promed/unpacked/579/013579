Dibrugarh district has reported a huge decline in vector-borne diseases over the last 3 years after National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) ramped up measures to control the 6 vector-borne diseases.

The upper Assam district has recorded only a single case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and 4 cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) between 1 Jan-9 Jul 2021. One person with AES has also succumbed to the disease during the period.

Once considered a hotbed of JE and AES, the Dibrugarh district has shown a considerable decline in the number of cases this year [2021].

There has been a significant drop in JE and AES cases in Dibrugarh compared to the past 2 years. In 2019, Dibrugarh recorded 33 JE cases and 285 AES cases. Additionally, there were 11 JE deaths and 31 AES deaths that year [2019]. The number of cases came down in 2020, with 13 JE cases and 29 AES cases being reported from the district. There were also 2 JE deaths and 5 AES deaths last year [2020].

Siddhartha Saikia, district consultant of the Directorate of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), said, "Due to the sincere efforts of the health department, the cases have come down in Dibrugarh."

"We have so far detected one JE case and 4 AES cases in the district, and we are quite hopeful that the total cases will be quite negligible this year [2021]. The efforts of the health department have borne fruits in tackling the dreaded disease," he added.

He further added that awareness among people and improvement of facilities at primary health centres, community health centres, and district hospitals' immunisation of children has played a major role in bringing the cases down and also kept a check on the death rates.

"So far we have conducted 2452 door-to-door visits to create awareness. Moreover, we have distributed 25 217 medicated [insecticide treated] mosquito nets among the people. Fogging is being done in the rural pockets as well as in the urban vulnerable pockets of Dibrugarh town like Paltanbazar, Dibrujan, and Loharpatty," Siddhartha Saikia informed.

[Assam has been a state of very active JE virus transmission in recent years. The decline in JE and AES cases is remarkable. The above report mentions immunizations, and one assumes that JE vaccine is included, which may be responsible for the decline in JE cases. The reason for the decline in AES cases is not as clear. The public health authorities are to be commended for their public awareness program and bed net distribution efforts. The JE virus transmission season still has over 3 months to go, so more cases may occur. One hopes that the vaccination and other efforts will continue to be successful in reducing the JE case numbers. - Mod.TY
