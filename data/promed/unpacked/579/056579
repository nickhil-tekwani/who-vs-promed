France's champagne vines have been hit hard by downy mildew. According to the Comit√© Interprofessionnel du vin de Champagne, this level of mildew attack is exceptional, some even say unprecedented in recent history. The last large downy mildew outbreak in the area was in 2012, a smaller one in 2016.

Grape growers are spraying fungicides. Traditional copper based sprays are very efficient but are being washed off by rain. The mildew quickly adapts to some of the more modern synthetic fungicides, which resist the rain.

Estimates are that the worst hit regions will lose between 20% and 25% of their expected yield, although if there is a dry, sunny August and September, losses may be less. The hardest hit regions include the Marne valley and parts of the Aube valley, where high humidity has been coupled with hot conditions -- perfect for the pathogen.

[Downy mildew on grapevine is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Plasmopara viticola_. It causes lesions on leaves which later become covered with white downy growth and turn necrotic. It can also affect flowers and fruits. Disease development is favoured by temperatures of 15 to 20 deg C [59-68 deg F] and moist conditions. In years with warm, extended wet periods during bloom, fruit clusters may be partially or totally destroyed. The disease can cause severe crop losses. The disease occurs irregularly in most grape growing regions worldwide.

Spores are spread within a crop mainly by splashing rain, wind, or mechanical means. The pathogen survives between crops on infected plant debris as oospores, which are formed inside the host tissues. It is an obligate parasite and cannot be cultured _in vitro_. Disease management relies mainly on preventative fungicide applications according to forecasting services. Systemic fungicides are also available. All commercial grape cultivars are susceptible.

Downy mildews include many species of oomycetes in several genera which cause similar symptoms on a range of hosts, including many crops. Individual species usually have a narrow host range affecting only one or a few different hosts.
