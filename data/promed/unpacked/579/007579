Ribeirao Preto has recorded 14 dead monkeys already this year [2008].
The last occurrence was on Monday (14 [Jul 2008]), in Recanto
Princess Elizabeth, in Chacara das Palmeiras.

The Division of Vector Control, said that it could not collect
material for examination because of the [decomposed] state of the
animals, which had died several days previously.

On this Tuesday (15 [Jul 2008]), the division will begin [insecticide]
fogging in the Lagoinha and Candido Portinari neighborhoods, where 2
dead monkeys had been found that might have been infected with yellow
fever [YF] [virus]. The teams have a blockade in [sealed off?] the 2
neighborhoods last week in search of breeding [sites] of the mosquito
that transmits of the disease [virus]. [If
the monkey mortality indicates that sylvan (jungle) YF virus
transmission is occurring in or near an urban area, reduction of
_Aedes aegypti_ in these 2 neighborhoods is prudent to avoid urban YF
virus transmission. - Mod.TY]

Last Saturday (12 [Jul 2008]), the work was hampered by the lack of
collaboration of the residents. Two monkeys were found dead on [2 Jul
2008] in a town square in Lagoinha. Around 700 houses were visited.
Spraying will be conducted in a radius of 200 meters where the
monkeys were found in the 2 neighborhoods.

Tests for YF [virus] were negative for a 22-year-old woman who died
in the month of April [2008]. This information was reported this
morning [15 Jul 2008] by the head of the Department of Surveillance
and Health, Maria Luisa Santa Maria. [This woman presumably lived in
the area where the dead monkeys were found. - Mod.TY]

The results of the tests were reported by the Adolfo Lutz Institute
in Sao Paulo. The results were also negative for dengue,
leptospirosis, and hantaviruses. The cause of death of the woman has
not been clarified.

[As of 18 Jul 2008, the number of dead monkeys found in the city of
Ribeirao Preto had risen to 18, see:
<http://eptv.globo.com/busca/?q=macacos>.

Apparently, people are going into the Santa Teresa forest to feed &
photograph the wild monkeys, oblivious to the risk of contracting YF.
One marmoset has been found sufficiently soon after death to allow
specimens to be taken for diagnosis. - Mod.JW

This is an additional report of possible sylvan yellow fever (YF) that
in April 2008 caused the deaths of 2 monkeys in the region of San Jose
do Rio Preto in the state of Sao Paulo (see ProMED-mail archive no.
20080406.1268).
