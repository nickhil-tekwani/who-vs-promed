Cases of Dengue Fever Increase 30 Percent in Brazil
---------------------------------------------------
RIO DE JANEIRO: The incidence of dengue fever in Brazil between January and
September increased 30 percent compared with the same period in 2000,
health officials said on Wed 17 Oct 2001. Paulo Vilarinho, national
coordinator of the Anti-Dengue Fever Campaign, said the Health Ministry is
concerned about the increase in the number of cases and plans to intensify
its efforts to combat the disease, concentrating on some 600 municipalities
where the largest number of cases were detected. "The number of cases has
increased 30 percent nationwide, but in these 600 municipalities the growth
is more than 70 percent," he said.
The municipalities that most concern the Health Ministry are located in 6
of Brazil's 27 states: Amazonas, Rio Grande do Norte, Ceara, Rio de
Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Goias. [This situation is attributed to misguided
decisions by some mayors, who allegedly diverted funds earmarked for the
elimination of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito - which transmits the disease -
to other programs. According to official figures, the government spends
around 1 million reais (some $370 000) a day on efforts to combat the
mosquito.
