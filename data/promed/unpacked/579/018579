Bluetongue in France
-----------------------
Since the beginning of 2009, 79 households with new outbreaks (attributed

Among the 79 outbreaks of BT, 23 are related to clinical suspicion, and 56

the sentinels surveillance, while 31 were detected during routine testing,
such as pre-transport testing or upon farmers' request, etc.

- cattle: 71 households;
- sheep: 5 households;
- camelids: 2 households;

[France has been applying a general, obligatory vaccination of cattle
(older than 2.5 months) and sheep (older than 3 months), which seems to
have had satisfying results. This vaccination scheme, supported by the
state, has now been extended for the coming 12 months. Details on the
distribution of the outbreaks (with maps), on vaccination, on entomological
surveillance and on other aspects of BTV in France can be seen in the said
presentation.

During the said SCFCAH meeting, presentations on BTV were submitted also by
Italy, Portugal and Spain; all can be accessed at
