On Thu, 3 Nov 2005, 4 cases of multidrug-resistant _Salmonella
[enterica_ serotype - Mod.LL] Typhimurium DT [definitive type -
Mod.LL] 104 infections were notified to the Infectious Disease
Epidemiology Department by the Reference Laboratory of the Norwegian
Institute of Public Health. The 4 isolates had identical multi-locus
VNTR [variable number of tandem repeats - Mod.LL] analysis
(MLVA)-profiles (2-7-11-7-3) and antimicrobial resistance pattern
(Amp-Chlor-Tet-Sulph-Strep-Nal). The same MLVA profile and resistance
pattern was also detected in a routine sample of mixed meat that
consisted of both Norwegian meat and meat imported from Poland.
Further testing of unmixed samples showed salmonella growth only in
the imported meat. This isolate was subsequently confirmed to have
the same MLVA profile as found in the cases. Since sporadic
infections by multidrug-resistant serotype Typhimurium are very rare
in Norway (1), detection of these cases prompted an immediate
investigation.
Outbreak investigation
----------------------
3 of the 4 patients were interviewed on 4 Nov 2005 to determine the
time of symptom onset, illness duration, and exposure history during
the week before illness onset. These patients became ill between 2
Sep and 2 Oct 2005 and did not report any recent travel outside
Norway before onset of symptoms. All 3 patients reported eating
minced beef before becoming ill, and all of them tasted raw meat
during food preparation. The beef product was bought frozen at
national supermarket chain A during September 2005. This information
was immediately communicated to the Norwegian Food Safety Authority,
which started tracing of the suspected beef. On 8 Nov 2005, another
patient was confirmed to have a salmonella infection with an MLVA
pattern identical to one found in the index patients. This patient
became ill on 7 Oct 2005 and also consumed the suspected meat.
An urgent enquiry was sent through the Enter-net network on 4 Nov
2005 and an alert was posted on the European Early Warning and
Response System on 5 Nov 2005. In response, Denmark reported 2 cases
of serotype Typhimurium DT104 with identical MLVA-profie and
resistance pattern, one in a patient who had traveled to Poland. Some
other countries have also reported cases of serotype Typhimurium
DT104 with the same resistance pattern. However, this is a relatively
common type, and further investigation and typing are needed in
order to assess a possible link to the outbreak in Norway.
Product tracing and recall
---------------------------
The investigation indicated that the implicated beef was imported
from Poland in June 2005. The consignment was accompanied by
documentation that the batch had been controlled for salmonella and
tested negative. The consignment was divided in 3 parts by the
importer. The 1st part was sent to supplier 1, who took a routine
sample of the meat. This sample tested positive for salmonella and
had an MLVA profile indistinguishable to that of the cases. This meat
was not released to the market. The 2nd part of the original
consignment was delivered to supplier 2, which produced minced beef
and subsequently distributed it in frozen 400-gram packages in
September and October 2005 via supermarket chain A. The remainder of
the initial shipment was stored by the importer; testing of this meat
recovered serotype Typhimurium DT104 with the same MLVA profile.
Another sample was obtained from leftover frozen minced beef that was
stored in a freezer of one of the cases: testing of this sample is
pending. Based on epidemiological and microbiological data, the
imported meat used for preparation of minced beef was suspected to be
the source of this outbreak, and the product was recalled from the
market on 5 Nov 2005. In addition, an announcement through mass media
was made on the same day to warn the public not to consume this meat.
[Eurosurveillance] Discussion
-----------
The outbreak investigation implicated imported raw beef as the source
of the outbreak. The beef was processed into minced meat in Norway,
and subsequently distributed for sale via a national supermarket
chain. The outbreak probably occurred over several weeks, and since
only a limited number of people were affected, it is possible that
cooking the meat may have inactivated the bacteria, thereby
preventing more cases. The product was recalled from the market
according to zero tolerance policy for salmonella based on the
National Food Law. Each year, approximately 1500-2000 cases of
salmonellosis are reported in Norway, of which approximately 75-80
percent acquired infection abroad (3) [there is no previous citation
for reference 2 before this citation - Mod.LL]. The National
Salmonella Control Program documented that cattle, swine, and poultry
in Norway as well as domestically produced food products of animal
origin are virtually free from salmonella (2). Therefore, similarly t!
o Finland and Sweden, Norway has negotiated the agreement requiring
documentation of salmonella testing of meat and egg imports from EU
countries (3). The meat implicated in this outbreak was also
accompanied by such documentation.
The application of MLVA typing has been critical in both detecting
this outbreak and determining the source. The MLVA method has been
used as a routine typing tool for serotype Typhimurium isolates
received by Reference Laboratory of the Norwegian Institute of Public
Health since 2004 (4). This laboratory routinely receives all
salmonella isolates from human, animal, food and feed samples for
further typing. In comparison with PFGE gels, the MLVA fingerprinting
method is fast and easy to use, providing high-resolution
discrimination between serotype Typhimurium DT104 isolates, which are
often genetically similar. Since serotype Typhimurium DT104 is
commonly isolated, it may be difficult to detect differences in
strains using another typing technique. Therefore, the MLVA method
may be a valuable tool in determining the source of the outbreak.
Moreover, the easy strain identification makes it possible to rapidly
share results between countries in case of outbreaks. The detectio!
n of this outbreak through application of molecular methods
highlights the importance of genetic characterization of human and
food isolates in order to identify possible clusters. The presence of
an established system for tracing of food products facilitated a
rapid recall of the implicated meat.

[This discussion is adapted from the USA Department of Agriculture website:
<http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPHS/stdt104.htm>
Salmonellosis due to serotype Typhimurium DT104 is an emerging
foodborne pathogen detected in several countries worldwide including:
the USA, the UK, Canada, Germany, France, Austria, and Denmark. Of
particular concern with DT104 is the presence of a multiple
antimicrobial resistance pattern (R-Type) to ampicillin,
chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline
(ACSSuT). Molecular studies have demonstrated that in this strain,
resistance genes are chromosomally encoded. This is important because
removal of the selective pressure from antibiotics is not expected to
reverse resistance, as it might with extrachromosomal-mediated
resistance.
Also of concern is the increasing trend of additional resistance of
DT104 to trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone), which
has occurred in the UK. In the USA, DT104 R-type ACSSuT has been
isolated from poultry, swine, cattle, and other domestic and wild
animals.
DT104 is an animal pathogen and a foodborne pathogen of humans. The
mortality rate for clinically affected cattle with this strain is
reported to be 40-60 percent in some outbreaks in the UK. The case
fatality rate in humans may be higher than with other Salmonella
infections. In a study of 83 DT104 cases in the United Kingdom, 41
percent of patients were hospitalized and 3 percent died. In
contrast, the case-fatality rate for other nontyphoid Salmonella
infections was approximately 0.1 percent. In the USA, serotype
Typhimurium R-type ACSSuT infections have been more likely to cause
bacteremia and have been associated with longer hospitalizations. No
increase in mortality has been observed.
Recent antibiotic use in humans and animals is a predisposing factor
for serotype Typhimurium DT104 infection. This has been observed in
other enteric bacterial pathogens as well. Killing the competitive
gut flora may allow unrestricted growth of a pathogen. In addition,
the use of antibiotics to treat infection prolongs the carrier state
of DT104 in humans and animals. Both of these features indicate a
need to educate physicians, veterinarians, and the public about the
potential adverse consequences of indiscriminate antibiotic use.
The best prospect for minimizing human illness is a strategy of
barriers to introduction and multiplication of DT104 throughout the
farm-to-table continuum. Control measures that are effective against
other types of _Salmonella spp_ will reduce the likelihood of
transmission of serotype Typhimurium DT104. - Mod.LL]
