[1] China (Beijing) outbreak: update

Beijing is reintroducing strict lockdown measures and rolling out mass testing after a fresh cluster of novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] cases emerged from the city's largest wholesale food market, sparking fears of a resurgence of the deadly outbreak. Thousands lined up for tests after the Chinese capital reported 36 new COVID-19 cases on Monday [15 Jun 2020], bringing the total number to 79 since a locally transmitted infection was reported on [12 Jun 2020] for the 1st time in nearly 2 months, according to the National Health Commission. [Today's National Health Commission update posted approximately 7 am China time on 16 Jun 2020, reported an additional 27 cases in Beijing, 4 cases in Hebei, and 1 in Sichuan, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Beijing to 106. [See http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqtb/202006/9579b16df7654ce6bee3b446d071d79a.shtml; in Chinese] - Mod.MPP]

A fresh cluster of novel coronavirus cases have emerged from a wholesale food market in Beijing, after the city reported no new local infections for nearly 2 months. Tests were administered to workers at the Xinfadi market, anyone who had visited it in the past 2 weeks, or anyone who had come in contact with either group. The market is Beijing's largest wholesale food market, prompting inspections of fresh meat and seafood in the city and elsewhere in China.

Authorities also locked down the neighbourhood around a 2nd market, where 3 cases were confirmed. In all, 90 000 people are affected in the 2 neighbourhoods in the city of 20 million. Inspectors found 40 samples of the virus in the closed market, including on a chopping board for imported salmon. That prompted some supermarket chains to take salmon off their shelves over the weekend [13-14 Jun 2020] and inspect markets, stores, and restaurants. Experts were doubtful the virus was being spread through salmon or other food products.

"For my money, it is more likely to be a person who came into the area with lots of people and the virus has spread, as the virus does," said Ian MacKay, who studies viruses at the University of Queensland in Australia, adding there was no evidence to suggest a link between outbreaks and food.

The outbreak has already spread to the provinces of Liaoning and Hebei, where a total of 5 new cases were found to be close contacts of patients in Beijing [note the additional 4 cases in Hebei and 1 in Liaoning reported today by the National Health Commission at the URL above - Mod.MPP]

The new cluster has sent shock waves throughout China, with Beijing's municipal government spokesman Xu Hejian describing it as "an extraordinary period" during a press conference Sunday [14 Jun 2020]. Chinese state media has repeatedly touted China's effective measures in containing the virus as the number of infections and deaths surged abroad.

The sudden reemergence of the virus in Beijing, previously considered among the country's safest cities, has raised the prospect of a second wave of infections and the possible reintroduction of the types of sweeping lockdowns that had previously brought much of the country to a halt and hammered the economy. Fengtai district, where the Xinfadi market is located, announced Saturday [13 Jun 2020] the launch of a "wartime mechanism" and the establishment of a command centre to curb the spread of the virus.

On social media, the Global Times, a nationalist tabloid run by the Chinese government, posted a video of paramilitary police officers donning face masks patrolling the market after it was closed down on Saturday [13 Jun 2020]. Authorities imposed a lockdown on 11 residential compounds in the vicinity of the market, strictly prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving. Residents will have their temperatures checked and reported on a daily basis, and their food and daily necessities delivered. Beijing also rolled out mass nucleic acid testing for the coronavirus, setting up 193 sampling booths across the city.

More than 76 000 people were tested on Sunday [14 Jun 2020], with 59 people testing positive, Xu said at a news conference on Monday [15 Jun 2020]. Nucleic acid tests work by detecting the virus' genetic code, and can be more effective at detecting an infection, particularly in the early stages, than tests which examine a body's immune response, though the latter are easier to conduct.

Before the new cluster, Beijing had only recorded 420 local infections and 9 deaths compared to over 80 000 confirmed cases and 4634 deaths nationwide, thanks to its strict travel restrictions imposed at the start of the pandemic.

[It seems as though Beijing is now in a major "seek and ye shall find" mode, tracking down all possible infected individuals with history of exposure to the markets. In the past 24 hours they confirmed and additional 27 cases in Beijing, 4 in Hebei and 1 in Sichuan, bringing the total confirmed cases in Beijing to 106, in Hebei to 7, and in Liaoning to 1. It would not be surprising to hear of an increased massive testing undertaken as they accumulate contact lists of those who had a history of going to the markets in the 2 week period identified.

We await further information on additional genomic studies in the attempt to identify the location of origin of the virus.

[2] Superspreading events and their role in transmission
Date: Sun 14 Jun 2020

When 61 members of the Skagit Valley Chorale choir turned up to their weekly rehearsal on [10 Mar 2020], the coronavirus pandemic seemed like a distant threat. In the whole of Skagit County -- a slice of northern Washington State [USA] with a population of 129 000 -- there were just 2 confirmed cases of the illness. For 2.5 hours the choristers practised their songs, stopping part way through to snack on cookies and oranges and discuss the concert they had scheduled for that April [2020]. Although they didn't know it at the time, this would be the last practice that Skagit Valley Chorale would have for some time: one of the members in attendance was already infected with coronavirus.

Two weeks later, 53 of the attendees had reported symptoms of the viral infection -- an attack rate of 87 per cent. Of those, 33 tested positive for COVID-19 and a further 20 were considered to have probable infections. 3 of the attendees had such severe cases that they were hospitalised. 2 of those patients later died from the infection. That one choir practice, where the average age of an attendee was 69 years, had become the epicentre of a COVID-19 outbreak.

In the weeks before she received the 1st report of the choir group outbreak, Lea Hamner, Skagit County Public Health's lead for communicable disease, had watched the reports of a super-spreading event linked to a church in South Korea. "That was the only super-spreader event that I was aware of at the time, but nothing in the US had ever happened like that by [17 Mar 2020]. I did not expect what we found." On that day, Hamner's team received a call from a chorister saying that 3 members of the group had positive COVID-19 tests and a further 25 were showing symptoms. Suddenly, Hamner was dealing with a super-spreading event of her own.

Although coronavirus has been sweeping the globe for 5.5 months, we are only just beginning to piece together an understanding of how the disease spreads. We still don't know, for example, what role people with no symptoms play in transmitting the disease, or how long people stay infectious for. But we are beginning to understand that SARS-CoV-2 does not spread evenly across the population -- there is increasing evidence that some of the infected spread the virus much more widely than most. Understanding this phenomenon -- known as super-spreading -- will be vital to managing COVID-19 as countries enter the difficult no-man's-land where the disease is neither peaking, nor entirely eliminated.

The Skagit County choir outbreak was a "tragic, tragic, situation" says Hamner. But it is far from exceptional. Other super-spreading events have been catalogued at barbecues, meatpacking plants, and funerals. In a preprint scientific paper -- yet to be reviewed by other scientists -- researchers at the University of Hong Kong found that 20 per cent of COVID-19 cases accounted for 80 per cent of all transmissions. In one cluster identified in the study, 73 infections were linked to one individual attending bars in Lan Kwai Fong -- a small nightlife spot in central Hong Kong.

The study of super-spreading events turns the public understanding of how coronavirus spreads on its head. We're used to seeing charts that show how one person who contracts the virus can pass it on to 2 others, who each pass it on to 2 more, on and on leading to an exponential increase of cases. But this simplifies how transmission actually occurs. In the Hong Kong example, "rather than 1 person spreading to 1 or 2 others, then them spreading to 1 or 2 others [and so on], it was most likely 1 person spreading to a lot of other people in one go," says Ben Cowling, a professor at Hong Kong's School of Public Health and an author on the pre-print study.

In the UK, the government has placed a lot of emphasis on the R value of coronavirus: a number that captures how many people, on average, each person infected with COVID-19 passes the disease on to. At the start of the epidemic, the R0 (the transmission rate when no measures to curtail the spread have been taken) was thought to be between 2 and 3. In the UK, after months of lockdown the R is between 0.7 and one although in parts of the country the number may have ticked back over one.

But to really understand the spread of the disease, we might be better off looking at another number: the K value. Unlike R, K tells us how transmission numbers vary across a given population. In simple terms, a low K value suggests that a small number of cases are responsible for large amounts of disease transmission. It's important to know this number because knowing how a disease is spreading might change the kind of health interventions we put in place to stop it.

When a disease is still circulating widely in a population, as has been the case in the UK for several months now, pinpointing super-spreading events is tricky. England only resumed contact tracing at the very end of May [2020], after suspending it on [12 Mar 2020] for 11 weeks. In Hong Kong, which has a total of 1108 coronavirus cases and just 4 deaths, it's much easier to get a clear picture of how the virus spread. Cowling's study found that out of the 349 locally-transmitted cases they identified (the majority of the region's cases were imported from outside) 196 of them were linked to just 6 superspreading events.

But what turns certain situations into super-spreading events? The Skagit Country and Hong Kong examples share some qualities that made transmission more likely. In both situations, a large number of people spent an extended period of time in very close proximity. The chairs at the Skagit Valley Chorale practice session were spaced just 6-to-10 inches [about 15-25 cm] apart and the session lasted 2.5 hours. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines 'close contact' as being within 2 metres [about 6 ft] of someone with COVID-19).

Although much of the press coverage around similar events has concentrated on the people carrying COVID-19 (so-called 'super-spreaders'), Megan Murray, an epidemiologist at Harvard University says that we should by paying much closer attention to the kind of environments in which super-spreading events happen. Epidemiologists talk of the "3 Cs" that make transmission more likely. "Those are closed spaces, meaning buildings with poor ventilation or rooms with poor ventilation, close contact, so lots of people in those small spaces, and then crowds," Murray says.

This means that governments looking to halt the resurgence of COVID-19 should be looking for ways to prevent these kinds of situations. Rather than rushing to reopen bars and restaurants, they should slowly expand the number of contacts between people in a way that avoids indoor locations where lots of people are going to be present, she says. In the UK, the government is reportedly weighing up whether to relax the 2-metre social distancing rule that currently makes it difficult for pubs and restaurants to find a way to safely re-open.

In the summer, where people have access to outdoor spaces, that might be less of an issue, but people crowding into poorly-ventilated pubs in the winter months could create the perfect environment for super-spreading events. William Ristenpart, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of California, Davis, studies how humans release microscopic particles of fluid during speech. He authored a 2019 study detailing that the louder someone talked, the more particles they released as they spoke, which could mean that loud environments, such as bars, pose an extra level of risk for transmission.

But proving this conclusively for COVID-19 is tricky. At the moment, most of the evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is mainly transmitted through droplets -- large particles emitted when people sneeze or cough. There is limited evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is also present in aerosolised particles -- very small particles that float in air for much longer periods of time and can potentially infect people over greater distances, although it is still unknown how much transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is driven by these particles, and how much is driven by droplets. If SARS-CoV-2 is regularly transmitted by aerosolised particles, then poorly-ventilated and crowded indoor spaces pose an even higher risk of transmission.

In either case, Ristenpart recommends that increasing ventilation in indoor environments could reduce the risk of them turning into super-spreading locations. "I would urge people to think about increasing rates of ventilation," he says. "There are energy costs associated with that [but] that seems like, to me, a small price to pay for helping decrease the probability of transmission."

If a super-spreading event does happen, then it will come down to effective contact tracing to find the people who may have been in that environment and urge them to isolate. If contact tracers can find and isolate potentially infectious people fast enough, then it dramatically reduces the risk that those people will then become part of another super-spreading event.

In the end, that may have been what stopped the Skagit County outbreak from spreading much further than the choir members and their very close contacts. By the time Hamner's team had contacted all of the choir members, almost all of them had begun to isolate themselves anyway, she says. "We pretty much did not see many cases outside of that choir group and their immediate family," she says.

Since the outbreak, the choir members haven't had another practice but they have attended a webinar with infectious disease experts who spoke about why singing might increase the risk of transmitting viruses. Hamner is hopeful that other groups will find a way to adapt their events until things return to normal. "There's a lot of engineering we can do to still have the essence of our events while adapting," she says. "I will always be advocating for adaptations and smarter versions of people's events until we have a vaccine and widespread immunity."

[There is much logic involved in the discussion above, and I for one am in full agreement that superspreaders have played a major role in the transmission of this virus. Both the SARS-CoV-1 (2002-2003) and the MERS-CoV (ongoing in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012), both cousins of the SARS-CoV-2, have been involved with superspreading events. Perhaps the "true" R0 has not been as high as many forecasters have cited, but rather the impact of the superspreading events in locations where intense contact tracing was not done, gave a misleading impression/calculation on the transmissibility of this virus. This discussion is all the more important as a justification for as complete contact tracing as possible, to avoid repetitive superspreading events, especially when the viral load is at maximal levels in an infected individual beginning prior to the onset of symptoms. A piece of information missing in the discussion above of the choir practice is whether the superspreader was in fact asymptomatic at the time of the choir practice.- Mod.MPP

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 15 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- As the pandemic accelerates in low- and middle-income countries, WHO is especially concerned about its impact on people who already struggle to access health services - often women, children, and adolescents. WHO has developed guidance on maintaining essential services.

- WHO has also carefully investigated the risks of women transmitting COVID-19 to their babies during breastfeeding. Based on the available evidence, WHO's advice is that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of COVID-19. A Q and A on breastfeeding and COVID-19 is also available.

- WHO has recently released a photo story outlining 10 actions you can take to protect and improve your sexual and reproductive health during the COVID-19 pandemic. At present, there is no evidence of sexual transmission of the virus responsible for COVID-19. The virus can be passed, however, through direct contact with saliva, for instance, kissing.

- There are also many things people can do to take care of their own health, like staying active, eating a nutritious diet, and limiting their alcohol intake.

- In today's 'subject in focus', we look at the solidarity trials, which are being used to accelerate research on a COVID-19 vaccine.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 52.6% of the global newly reported cases and 66.4% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. The USA reported 36.3% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, Brazil reported 31.1%, Chile 9.9%, Peru 6.3%, and Mexico 5.0%. The same 5 countries at the top, juggling positions on a daily basis.

The European region reported 13.7% of the global newly reported cases and 8.9% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, Russia reported 45.5% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Turkey 8.6%, the UK 8.3%, Belarus 4.0%, Sweden 3.8%, and Ukraine 3.6%. Again, same countries, minor juggling of orders and percentages on a daily basis.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 14.8% of the global newly reported cases and 11.2% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 26.7% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia 21.5%, Iran 12.6%, Egypt 8.2%, Oman 7.1%, Iraq 6.4%, and Qatar 6.0%.

The African region reported 6.0% of the global newly reported cases and 2.9% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 54.2% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 11.4%, Cameroon 10.4%, Ghana 3.8%, Cote d'Ivoire 3.0%, Ethiopia 2.3%, Central African Republic 2.1%, and Kenya 1.7%.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.85% of the global newly reported cases and 0.38% of global fatalities. The Philippines reported 47.6% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 36.0%, Japan 6.5%, and South Korea 3.2%.

The South East Asia region reported 12.0% of the global newly reported cases and 10.3% of global fatalities. India reported 72.1% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 19.7%, Indonesia 5.4%, and Nepal 2.7%.

Impression: Europe seems to be stabilizing at a significantly lower rate, although Russia is still reporting 8000+ new cases a day. The Eastern Mediterranean has surpassed the European region with Pakistan reporting 5-6000+ cases a day. South East Asia is approaching parity with the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions with India reporting 8000-10 000+ cases a day. The Americas region is reporting over 70 000 cases a day with Brazil reporting 25 000-30 000+ cases a day, and the USA seems to have stabilized at 20 000+ a day. In the Africa region, the regional proportion is slowly climbing, with South Africa reporting in the 2000-3000+ range daily, and in the Western Pacific region, they are maintaining a very low rate compared with the other regions, with Singapore and the Philippines averaging 400+ cases per day (Singapore had been reporting twice as many cases per day for a period of time but has dropped back over the past couple of weeks).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 15 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia, which is approaching parity with the European region in terms of daily newly confirmed cases and the Eastern Mediterranean, which has overtaken the European region; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is "not applicable"; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.MPP]

Countries with more than 5000 cases not on the list above (as the list has grown longer, we froze the list and maintain a list of countries passing the 5000-case mark):

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 8 112 611, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global count has now passed the 8 million case mark, having passed the 7 million case mark on 7 Jun 2020. The global case count increased by 1.6% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.18 million confirmed cases, now represents 26.9% of the global cases of COVID-19, as other countries such as Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases significantly. A global total of 439 051 deaths have been reported, an increase of 3874 deaths in the past 24 hours. A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, there is major underreporting of numbers of infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, possibly 1/10th to 1/20th in order of magnitude. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home and who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, the UK, Spain, Italy, Peru, Iran (having surpassed Germany in the past 24 hours) and Germany at number 10. China is number 19. In descending rank order, Brazil is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by the USA, India, Russia, Mexico, Pakistan, Chile, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Peru.

The top 20 countries in terms of absolute cumulative cases, which include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 5 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 1 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the Western Pacific region, a new country from the Eastern Mediterranean region was added in the past 24 hours. There are no countries from the Africa region. The top 20 countries with most newly confirmed cases include 7 from the Americas region, 7 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the European region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 2 from the African region, none from the Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.MPP]
