Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 11 Aug 2015
Date of confirmation of the event: 31 Aug 2015
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 7 Apr 2007
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: West Nile virus
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (2)
Outbreak 1: Albaron, Arles, Bouches-Du-Rhone
Date of start of the outbreak: 11 Aug 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Equidae / 60 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: The affected equine (a 3-year-old Lusitano horse) showed neurological signs (ataxia, consciousness disorders, decubitus) since 11 Aug 2015. The accredited veterinarian of the farm came on 17 Aug 2015, and, following the clinical signs observed, took samples for West Nile virus. Since the signs got worse, the horse was euthanized on 19 Aug 2015. This equine was in a farm with around 60 Lusitano horses. To date, 2 other horses are suspected of West Nile fever. The tests are being performed.

Outbreak 2: Beaucaire, Fourques, Gard
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 Aug 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Equidae / 20 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: The affected equine (a 3-year-old Anglo-Arabian mare) showed neurological signs (behavioral disorders, decubitus) associated with a marked hyperthermia since 17 Aug 2015. The accredited veterinarian of the farm came the same day, and, following the clinical signs observed, took samples for West Nile virus. Since the signs got worse (convulsions), the horse was euthanized on 17 Aug 2015. This equine was in a farm with 19 horses of Anglo-Arabian and Selle Francais breeds. To date, no other equine in the farm has showed clinical signs. Samples have been taken from all animals.

Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 2
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Equidae / 80 / 2 / 0 / 2 / 0
Outbreak statistics: [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 2.50 / 0 / 0 / 2.50
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The farms with the animals affected by West Nile fever are in the outskirts of the Camargue National Park. Under the terms of a bylaw, the farms have been declared infected and are subjected to the following measures: - inventory of all animals of susceptible species; - ban on movements of infected animals or animals suspected of having viral encephalitis; - epidemiological investigation (clinical data, origin of infection); - application of authorised insecticides to equidae and premises, if necessary; - clinical monitoring by an accredited veterinarian.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; control of arthropods; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Calvados Veterinary Laboratory (Local laboratory) / Equidae / enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 27 Aug 2015 / Positive
ANSES (National Food Security Agency), Animal Health Laboratory in Maisons-Alfort (National laboratory) / Equidae / enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 31 Aug 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2015, Chapter 2.1.20 West Nile Fever at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.20_WEST_NILE.pdf, from which the commentary below is extracted:

"West Nile fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that can affect birds, humans, and horses causing inapparent infection, mild febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis, or death. West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ in the family Flaviviridae. The arbovirus is maintained in nature by cycling through birds and mosquitoes; numerous avian and mosquito species support virus replication. For many avian species, WNV infection causes no overt signs, while other birds, such as American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) and blue jays (_Cyanocitta cristata_), often succumb to fatal systemic illness. Among mammals, clinical disease is primarily exhibited in horses and humans.

Clinical signs of WNV infection in horses arise from viral-induced encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. Infections are dependent on mosquito transmission and are seasonal in temperate climates, peaking in the early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Affected horses frequently demonstrate mild to severe ataxia. Signs can range from slight incoordination to recumbency. Some horses exhibit weakness, muscle fasciculation, and cranial nerve deficits. Fever is not a consistently recognised feature of the disease in horses."

According to the information provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), as of 28 Aug 2015, 13 human cases of West Nile fever have been reported in the EU. 17 cases have been reported in neighboring countries since the beginning of the 2015 transmission season.
