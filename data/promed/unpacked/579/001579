The Department of Health (DOH) noted the high incidence of
leptospirosis cases in the [Davao Region,] a deadly disease caused by
_Leptospira_ bacterium that can reside in the kidneys of rats [as
well as other rodents and other animals. - Mod.LL]

Dr Rogelio Penera, medical specialist of the DOH [of Region XI],
warned the public to be careful especially those in flooded areas, as
urine of rodents are carried by waters.

He said the bacterium could pass through open wounds in humans and is
common during rainy seasons mostly in urban areas although there are
also cases in rice farms where rats thrive.

Because of the wide range of symptoms the infection is often wrongly
diagnosed. This leads to a lower reported number of cases than the
actual number of cases of leptospirosis.

[Leptospirosis is a spirochetal infection that is distributed widely
throughout the world, with the major risk factor being exposure to
water, no matter how pristine-looking, that has been contaminated
with infected animal, usually rodent, urine. Because of its varied
manifestations, particularly in clusters, many different diseases
including viral hemorrhagic fever and hantavirus infection need to be
considered in the differential diagnosis.

Leptospire infection has protean manifestations. As a result, it is
frequently misdiagnosed. Approximately 15-40 percent of patients who
were exposed but did not become ill show serologic evidence of past
infection. The incubation period is usually 7-12 days, with a range
of 2-20 days. Approximately 90 percent of patients manifest a mild
anicteric (without jaundice) form of the disease, and approximately
5-10 percent have the severe form with jaundice, otherwise known as
Weil's disease. Severe disease can also manifest with respiratory
symptoms, and this has been described associated with pulmonary
hemorrhage in Argentina. The treatment of choice is tetracycline.

The Davao Region, designated as Region XI, is one of the regions of
the Philippines, located on the southeastern portion of Mindanao. It
consists of 4 provinces, namely: Compostela Valley, Davao del Norte,
Davao Oriental, and Davao del Sur. The region encloses the Davao Gulf
and its regional center is Davao City. Davao is the Hispanicized
pronunciation of daba-daba, the Bagobo word for "fire" (the Cebuano
translation is "kayo"). This information as well as a map showing the
location of the region can be found at
