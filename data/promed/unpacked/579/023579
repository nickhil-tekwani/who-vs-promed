When commenting on the plague posting it would be a great opportunity for
you to add in a line or two about the "public health concern". For example
here in California, [as in most (all?) states in the USA plague is a
reportable disease. Under " Section 2500 of Title 17, California Code of
Regulation" "any case or suspect case MUST be reported by telephone to the
Local Health Officer or Director of the State Department of Health
Services. The regulation specifically spells out the responsibility of the
laboratory as well.
Each and every health care professional must understand and appreciate they
unique role, and that they are all essential links in the
communication/notification chain. Certainly a single case of bubonic plague
every few months does not seem like a significant (relatively speaking)
public health concern, but the bigger concern is this. Plague (as well as
other agents) is one of the top agents of concern from a bio-terrorist
assault.
At the State Health Department we know that the local hospitals and clinics
will most likely encounter the first few cases of a biological release. The
patients may not present at the same medical center, for that reason we
depend on the "front line health care professionals" to:
1) consider diseases like plague, anthrax, botulism and small pox. These
are often not considered in a physician's differential diagnosis. I can
tell you from specific examples that paralysis due to botulism toxin can be
delayed for weeks to as much as a month. If the first few cases of anthrax
or plague were delayed for several weeks, and then to compile the problem
there is a delay in notifying the authorities, many lives would be lost and
our health care system would be overwhelmed.
2) Prompt notification of ALL (especially, suspect) cases of any reportable
disease.

[Dr. McGee is correct in that many of these diseases, especially in the
USA, and perhaps in other countries, are reportable diseases and all health
care officials should take these incidents seriously and report them to
your proper agency. - Mod.TG
