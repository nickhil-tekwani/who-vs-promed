Row over 'tree man' virus samples
--------------------------------------------
An Indonesian fisherman who developed tree-like growths on his hands
and feet is at the centre of an international medical spat after his
country's health minister criticised doctors trying to treat him.
Indonesia's Health Minister, Siti Fadilah Supari, lambasted the US
doctor currently treating the 35-year-old man, who has the rare
affliction caused by [a] human papillovirus.

Mrs. Supari is angry that Dr. Anthony Gaspari has taken blood and
tissue samples out of the country to the United States in a bid to
diagnose the illness. She claims such samples could be used in the
future to make vaccines that the poor could not afford. Developing
nations such as Indonesia risk exploitation unless they maintain
control over their virus strains, Mrs. Supari said. But her comments
have now offended Dr. Gaspari, an American dermatologist at the
University of Maryland, who maintains that, while he took the samples
without permission, his sole motivation was getting treatment for the
man.

Known simply as Dede, the man, who lives in a village south of the
capital Jakarta, has massive root-like warts growing from his arms
and legs which have gone untreated for years. "We did take samples,
and the reason we did was to render a diagnosis. We did it for
humanitarian reasons, to help the patient," Dr. Gaspari said,
stressing his willingness to put in writing that the samples were not
for commercial use.

Mrs. Supari, who has famously refused to share bird flu samples with
international scientists, made her comments on Sunday [25 Nov 2007]
after returning from a World Health Organisation (WHO) conference in
Geneva. "We are offended because the samples were taken from Dede
without our permission," she told reporters at the hospital where the
man was being treated. "If they are taken abroad, they could become
lucrative commodities."

The intergovernmental conference was aimed at rebuilding a global
system for sharing viruses. Indonesia is the nation the worst hit by
bird flu, with a total of 91 human deaths recorded. Mrs. Supari has,
however, steadfastly refused to share samples of the deadly H5N1
strain of the disease until she receives assurances they will not be
used to make expensive pandemic vaccines. For its part, WHO wants to
make sure the virus has not mutated to a form that spreads more
easily between people.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[This unfortunate situation is a product of political
misunderstanding of the process of treatment of a patient with an
unusual condition and a lack of appellation of local sensitivities on
the part of a visiting academic. Dr. Anthony Gaspari is a
distinguished dermatologist involve in examination of a patient with
unusual "tree-like" growths on hands and feet apparently caused by an
unspecified human papillomavirus.

There are very many human papillomaviruses, most of which are
uncharacterized. Many papillomaviruses cannot be propagated in
culture and require sophisticated molecular procedures for their
characterization and identification. No doubt it was Dr. Gaspari's
intention to transport clinical samples from the patient to a
laboratory where the virus could be characterized and the patient's
immune responses investigated. It was regrettable that appropriate
persuasion was not sought for this undertaking. The identification of
the specific human papillomavirus and immune responses involved in a
rare skin disease is however, unlikely to have any immediate
commercial value.

We hope that there will be an amicable resolution of this dispute. - Mod.CP]
