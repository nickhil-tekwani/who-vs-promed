The report, attributed to an unidentified medical officer, is that the
situation was on that date alarming in the Oriental Province. He said that
the first word on the cholera outbreak came on 19 Nov 1997 saying that it
had begun in mid-Oct 1997, but that it is likely it actually began one
month before (mid-Sep 1997). He gave the case total as over 1,200 with 300
deaths. Mortality is currently 19 percent, compared to a 1 percent
mortality rate in normal cholera epidemics in the country. It was
expected, according to this medical officer, that the epidemic would slow
down by early Jan. Instead, the number of cases went into a sharp
increase, with about 15 new cases and 6 or 7 deaths reported each day.
On 6 Feb the epidemic was at the threshold inside the town of Kisangani.
