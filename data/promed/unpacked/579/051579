Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy in France - Atypical cases
-----------------------------------------------------------
Emergency report
Translation of information received on 26 Jan 2004 from Dr Isabelle
Chmitelin, Deputy Director General, General Directorate for Food (DGAL),
Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Fisheries and Rural Affairs, Paris:
Date of the report: 16 Jan 2004.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 11 Jan 2004.
Six atypical cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) have been
detected within the framework of the routine active surveillance programmes
(abattoirs, downers).
Affected population: the 6 affected cows were aged from 8 years to 15 years.
Location of the cases: departments of Loire-Atlantique (2 cases),
Cotes-d'Armor (1 case), Creuse (1 case), Loire (1 case) and Jura (1 case).
Control measures: the cohort of each affected cow was destroyed in
accordance with Regulation No. 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of
the Council of the European Union.
Diagnosis:
In each case, the electrophoretic profiles observed in the confirmatory
tests were different from those observed in classical bovine spongiform
encephalopathy cases (apparent molecular weight of PrPSc protein, glycoform
distribution, detection using P4 monoclonal antibody.
Genetic analysis of several of these atypical cases has ruled out the
hypothesis of a polymorphism in the gene coding for the prion protein.
Inoculation of samples into laboratory animals is currently under way to
determine more accurately the biological characteristics of these isolates.
A. Laboratory where confirmatory testing was carried out: NCTA(1)-Virology
Unit, French Agency for Food Safety (AFSSA(2)), Lyon.
B. Confirmatory test used: western blot (RB1 polyclonal antibody, P4
monoclonal antibody).
(1) NCTA: non-conventional transmissible agents
(2) AFSSA: Agence francaise de securite sanitaire des aliments

Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, the most likely cause of
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, is thought to be caused by a
unique infectious agent, with stable features, even when transmitted to
other species. Here, we show the existence of an atypical molecular
phenotype among cattle diagnosed with BSE in France. Following western blot
analysis, three cases showed unusual features of the electrophoretic
profiles of the protease-resistant prion protein (PrP(res)) accumulating in
the brain. The PrP(res) patterns were similar in these three atypical cases,
showing a higher molecular mass of unglycosylated PrP(res) and strong
labelling by P4 monoclonal antibody compared to 55 typical BSE cases. This
finding suggests either some phenotypic modifications of PrP(res) following
infection by the BSE agent or the existence of alternative origins of such
diseases in cattle.
