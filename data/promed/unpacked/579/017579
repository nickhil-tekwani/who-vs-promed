Re: Tick-borne encephalitis risk
--------------------------------
Please keep in mind that reported cases are always biased by at least
3 factors: the number of cases diagnosed, the reporting system and the
vaccination rate. Amongst the areas of highest risk besides Austria
and the Czech Republic are, e.g., the island of Bornholm or the Baltic
States where extensive vaccination campaigns have led to a dramatic
decrease in cases (roughly comparable to Austria) but -- of course --
NOT to a decrease of the risk for non-immune persons. This
misconception could be the reason why Austria for a long time was NOT
listed as risk area by the [US] CDC (this obviously was changed
recently).

For further details you are welcome to visit the home page of the

[ProMED-mail thanks Martin Haditsch for provision of this additional
information. The moderator's admonition remains unaffected that
visitors to many northern European countries and large parts of
Central and Eastern Asia where tick-borne encephalitis is endemic
should be made aware of the need to avoid bites by ticks or, in the
case of prolonged residence, the advisability of seeking vaccination.
