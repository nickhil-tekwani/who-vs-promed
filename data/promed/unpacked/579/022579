A European Union summary report [EUSR] on the monitoring of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) has been published by the European Food Safety Authority.

TSEs are a group of diseases that affect the brain and nervous system of humans and animals. These include scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and chronic wasting disease (CWD). With the exception of classical BSE, there is no scientific evidence that TSEs can be transmitted to humans.

The report from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) provides results on data collected by all EU member states, plus Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland for 2016.

Main findings include:
- 5 cases of BSE in cattle out of 1.35 million animals tested in the EU -- none of which entered the food chain. Only one of these was classified as classical BSE. The animal was born after enforcement of the EU ban on the use of animal proteins began in 2001.
- 685 cases of scrapie in sheep out of 286 351 animals tested; and
- 634 in goats out of 110 832 tested in the EU.

No cases of CWD were found in any of the 2712 cervids tested, including reindeer, elk, and moose, in the EU. However, 5 cases of CWD were reported in Norway: 3 in wild reindeer and 2 in moose. This is the 1st confirmation of CWD in Europe.

Titled "EUSR on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies in 2016," the report abstract [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2017.5069/full] says it presents the results of surveillance activities on TSEs in bovine animals, sheep, goats, cervids, and other species, as well as genotyping data in sheep, carried out in 2016 in the European Union according to Regulation (EC) 999/2001, and in Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland. In 2016, 1 352 585 bovine animals were tested in the European Union, which is 5 percent less than in 2015.

Sheep scrapie was reported by 20 member states in a total of 685 animals.

A total of 9 member states reported 634 cases of goat scrapie. A total of 25 ovine scrapie cases were reported by Iceland and Norway. At the EU level, the occurrence of scrapie in small ruminants remains stable, with 1175 cases of classical scrapie reported and 135 atypical scrapie cases.

A total of 97.2 percent of the classical scrapie cases in sheep occurred in animals with genotypes belonging to the susceptible group, and a random sampling showed that 26.6 percent of the genotyped sheep held genotypes of the susceptible group, excluding Cyprus.

[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a fatal neurological disease of adult cattle that was first recognised in Great Britain and that has been identified in classical (C-type BSE) and atypical forms. Both C-type BSE and atypical forms have been detected in cattle indigenous to most European countries, the Americas, and Asia and the Pacific. BSE is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), or prion disease. The C-type BSE epizootic resulted from oral exposure to prions in the ruminant-derived protein of meat-and-bone meal and milk replacers included in animal feedstuffs. As a result of control measures, C-type BSE epizootics are in decline. The C-type BSE agent is also believed to be the common source, via dietary routes, of TSEs in other ruminant species and felidae. There is evidence of a causal link between the C-type BSE agent and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans. Recommendations for handling BSE-infected material assume that BSE is a zoonosis and manipulations with potentially contaminated material must be performed at an appropriate biosafety and containment level determined by biorisk analysis. The archetype for the TSE group of diseases is scrapie of sheep and goats.

Scrapie is a neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats, known since several millennia, characterised by the typical spongiform encephalopathy changes which have been observed since 1986 also in cattle TSE, namely BSE. The 'classic' scrapie is contagious among sheep and goats but, contrary to classic BSE, not known to infect humans. The more recently identified condition known as atypical scrapie has some clinical and pathological features similar to classical scrapie but it is not considered to be transmitted in field situations.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a contagious prion disease of cervids, was discovered in 1967, already reported from 24 US states and 2 Canadian provinces, spread in part by shipments of infected animals. Many species of cervids are susceptible, including elk, moose, and several kinds of deer. Infected animals typically begin showing signs such as weight loss, lethargy, and drooling 2 to 3 years after infection and then die within months. The major foci of CWD are Colorado/Wyoming (USA), Wisconsin/Illinois (USA), and Alberta/Saskatchewan (Canada). In Wyoming, where CWD has been endemic for decades, up to 40 per cent of some herds are infected, and white-tailed deer populations are declining by 10 per cent a year.

CWD has already spread out of North America: it is present in captive cervids in South Korea and, since 2016, in wild reindeer and moose in Norway.

Norway's 1st case was detected by chance after wildlife biologists working in the rugged mountains of Nordfjella found a sick young reindeer on 15 Mar 2016. After its death, tests at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute (NVI) in Oslo pointed to CWD. Following the detection of additional cases, Norway's minister of agriculture and food gave, on 26 Mar 2017, the green light for hunters to kill off the entire herd in which 3 infected individuals were found, about 2000 reindeer, or nearly 6 per cent of the country's wild population. This decision has led to discussions (see 20170415.4972250, 20170416.4973532). For a recent review on the zoonotic aspects of CWD, see reference below.

Variant CJD (vCJD), the human TSE attributed to infection from consumed prion-contaminated bovine tissues (primary cases) but sporadically also by an iatrogenic route (secondary cases) has been recognised since 1993. As of 5 Dec 2016, the total number of primary vCJD cases in humans, worldwide, was reportedly 228, of which 175 in the UK and 53 in 11 other countries as follows: France (27), Spain (5), Rep of Ireland and USA (4 each), Italy and Netherlands (3 each), Canada and Portugal (2 each), Saudi Arabia, Japan, and Taiwan (1 each). The accumulated number of secondary vCJD cases, worldwide, as of 6 Dec 2016, was 3 (all in the UK).
