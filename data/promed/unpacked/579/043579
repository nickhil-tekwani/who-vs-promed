--------------------------------------------------------------------
Soilborne wheat mosaic disease (SBWMD), originally attributed to infections by _Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus_ (SBWMV) and _Wheat spindle streak mosaic virus_ (WSSMV), is one of the most frequent virus diseases and causes economic losses in wheat in southern Brazil.

Wheat leaves and stems displaying mosaic symptoms were collected from different wheat cultivars in southern Brazil. Double‐stranded RNA was extracted and submitted to cDNA library synthesis and next‐generation sequencing. No sequences of SBWMV and WSSMV were detected but the complete genome sequence of a putative new member of the family Benyviridae was determined, for which the name wheat stripe mosaic virus (WhSMV) is proposed.

WhSMV has a bipartite genome similar to that of viruses belonging to Benyviridae. In addition to the genomic organization and nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities, phylogenetic analyses also corroborated that WhSMV is a virus species of the Benyviridae. However, isolates of WhSMV formed a clade distinct from members of the genus _Benyvirus_. It was also demonstrated that the plasmodiophorid _Polymyxa graminis_ is associated with wheat roots showing SBWMD symptoms and infected by WhSMV.

Soilborne viruses transmitted by _Polymyxa graminis_ can lead to major yield losses in wheat crops worldwide. In June 2016, randomly irregular patches of wheat plants exhibiting streaking mosaic on the leaves and stunting were observed in an experimental field. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of rod-shaped like-virus particles, similar to those belonging to the genera _Benyvirus_ and _Furovirus_.

Based on electron microscopy and molecular assays the virus was identified as wheat stripe mosaic virus (WhSMV). The presence of resting spores of _P. graminis_ in the roots of symptomatic wheat plants was confirmed by optical microscopy. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of WhSMV in Paraguay.

[_Polymyxa graminis_ is an obligate root parasite in the poorly studied group of fungus-like organisms informally called 'plasmodiophorids'. It can transmit a range of viruses belonging to several genera (including _Furovirus_, _Benyvirus_, _Bymovirus_) that cause serious diseases of cereals; the related _P. betae_ transmits viruses of sugar beet, including the virus causing rhizomania (more information via ProMED-mail post 20160602.4260593). The viruses are protected from the environment within the resting spores (cysts) which can remain viable for decades. Disease management of the associated soil‐borne viruses mainly relies on virus resistant crop cultivars.

From the genomic data reported above, the new WhSMV may represent a new genus within the family of Benyviridae which currently has _Benyvirus_ as its only member genus.
