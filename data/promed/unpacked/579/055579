BABESIOSIS, POSSIBLE - BOSNIA (3)

>From Albert Pizzo,MD: I am forwarding this post concerning possible
Babesiosis in Bosnia. This is in response to a previous PROMED post on
this subject.
The following is a post from Prof. Fred Reyers:
In response to the question of whether one should be looking for
human babesiosis if there is a high incidence of canine babesiosis in
military dogs in Bosnia, my response is as follows:
There are no authenticated reports of humans becomming infected with
any of the strains of Babesia canis or B. gibsoni. There are,
however, numerous reports of humans becomming infected with B.
microti (mouse babesiosis) and (I think) B. divergens (one of the
bovine babesiosis types). Generally, the thinking is that neither of
these latter Babesias can establish an infection in a human with a
totally intact immune system and only appear to be a threat to
immunocompromised humans.

This probably implies that humans become infected but the parasite
cannot establish itself successfully. If that is the case with B.m.
and B.d., then it is probably also the case with B.c., provided that
the vector tick bites humans - something of which I am not entirely
sure for the European situation where Dermacentor is the vector.
