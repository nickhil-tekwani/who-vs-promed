Viet Nam: Total human avian influenza infections since Dec 2004 now 21
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A 35-year-old woman from Vietnam's capital city of Hanoi, who has been
hospitalized since 24 Feb 2005, has just been confirmed to have contracted
avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection, raising the total infections in the
country since December 2004 to 21.
Samples from the woman, who is under treatment at the capital's Tropical
Disease Institute, tested H5N1-positive, according to sources from Vietnam's
National Hygiene and Epidemiology Institute (NHEI), which tests samples from
suspected cases of bird flu infection from the northern region.
The woman, who works as a rubbish collector in the city, has frequently been
present in live poultry markets, a doctor from the Tropical Disease Institute
said, noting that she has neither eaten poultry meat nor lived in bird flu-
hit areas since mid-Feb 2005.
In the most recent outbreak starting late December 2004, Vietnam has
identified 21 local people who have contracted H5N1 virus infection.
Vietnam's Health Ministry said that 12 local people and a Cambodian woman
have died of the disease in Vietnam since then.
The local newspaper Pioneer, however, reported 2 more H5N1-related deaths on
Tue 1 Mar 2005. The 2 fatal cases over the past week include a 69-year-old
man from northern Thai Binh province and a young man from the same province.
[The young man's younger sister exhibited symptoms of avian influenza virus
infection, but has since tested H5N1-negative - Mod.CP]

[I am indebted to Helen Branswell of the Canadian Press for pointing out that
the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDAR) at the
University of Minnesota is compiling up-to-date unambiguous figures of avian
influenza cases and deaths in East Asia. As of Mon 28 Feb 2005 the number of
unofficial cases (i.e., the aggregated WHO, press and governmental figures)
in East Asia from Jan 2004 to the present is 65 with 46 deaths; whereas the
official (WHO) figures are 55 cases and 42 deaths.
During the period 28 Jan 2004 to 25 Oct 2004, the unofficial and the official
figures are the same: i.e. Thailand 17 cases and 12 deaths; Viet Nam 27 cases
and 20 deaths; giving totals for East Asia of 44 cases and 32 deaths.
The numbers of cases reported from mid-Dec 2004 to 28 Feb 2005 are:
Country / Unofficial (Official) Cases / Unofficial (Official) Deaths
Cambodia / 1 (1) / 1 (1)
Thailand / 0 (0) / 0 (0)
Viet Nam / 20 (10) / 13 (9)
Total / 21 (11) / 14 (10)
