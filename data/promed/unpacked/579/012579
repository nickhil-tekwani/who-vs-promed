Please find below an update on previous reports, submitted by me (my
contact details are below) on behalf of Dr Gardner Murray, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Australia <gardner.murray@affa.gov.au>

On 31 May 2002 a follow-up emergency report was provided to OIE
on an outbreak of Newcastle disease on one farm in the State of
Victoria, Australia (previous reports were provided to OIE on 10, 12,
14 and 24 May 2002). This report contained the following updated
information.
Destruction and disposal of all 249 069 birds on the infected farm was
completed on 24 May 2002. A cleaning and disinfection program for
the infected premises has commenced. This program and subsequent
surveillance will be conducted consistent with the Australian Veterinary
Emergency Plan (AUSVETPLAN) for Newcastle disease
<http://www.aahc.com.au/ausvetplan/>
The rest of Victoria and Australia outside of the Control Area
(surveillance zone) continues to remain free of Newcastle disease.
