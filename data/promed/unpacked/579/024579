An outbreak of diarrhea caused by the protozoan parasite _Cyclospora cayetanensis_, has been reported to ProMED in the city of Leon, State of Guanajuato, Mexico.

After a graduation party on June 16 [2017], where about 1000 people attended, approximately 80 percent of them got sick. Many are still symptomatic; many required hospitalization.

Cyclospora has been identified by microscopy and one case by molecular methods.

[_Cyclospora cayetanensis_ is a human protozoan parasite excreted in feces from infected persons. There is, as far as we know, no animal reservoir. The oocysts excreted in feces are thought to require days to weeks in favorable environmental conditions to sporulate (become infective), and therefore direct person-to-person transmission is highly unlikely.

There have been several multi-state outbreaks in the United States and Canada in 2015 and 2016 (see ProMED posts listed below). These outbreaks have been traced to lettuce imported from Mexico. A report from the UK from August 2015 reported cyclosporiasis in UK tourists returning from Riviera Maya, Mexico. Thus the outbreak reported here most likely comes from vegetables or berries contaminated by sporulated _C. cayetanensis_ oocysts because human waste has been used as a fertilizer.

Additional information from health authorities including epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak and any implicated foods would be appreciated. - Mod.EP
