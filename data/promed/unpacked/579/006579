A Holland-based seed company, Rijk Zwaan seeds, says no one can say
for sure why Carnarvon crops were infected [with PSTVd, see
ProMED-mail post 20101201.4322] last [2009] season.

The _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd) was found on 11 farms in
2009. No new cases have been found in 2010.

[Referring to the recent report of an outbreak of PSTVd in Western
Australia (ProMED-mail post 20101201.4322), we have been requested to
clarify that PSTVd was detected in 2009 but no new infections were
recorded in 2010, as is stated in the item above. The dates of the
PSTVd detections were not explicitly specified in the story posted in
archive no. 20101201.4322. We are happy to provide this clarification.

_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd) is an important pathogen of
solanaceous crops including potato, tomato, and capsicum. Yield
losses can be up to 65 percent in potato and up to 50 percent in
tomato. For more information on PSTVd please see ProMED-mail post
20101201.4322 and previous items in the archives.
