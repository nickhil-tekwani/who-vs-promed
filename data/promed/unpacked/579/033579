2000/067 Control methods against _Monosporascus cannonballus_ (edited by DH)
The only means of control against _Monosporascus cannonballus_ (EPPO Alert
List), which causes sudden wilt of melons, is soil fumigation with methyl
bromide. Because the use of methyl bromide is expected to be banned in a
few years, alternative control methods have to be found. Studies were
carried out in Israel on possible alternative methods:
1) Laboratory studies showed that fluazinam totally inhibited the growth of
_M. cannonballus_ in culture (at concentrations of 10 Âµg a.i /ml). In field
trials fluazinam was applied via drip irrigation, four times during the
growing season on three melon plots. Disease incidence was reduced by 87%
in two plots and only 32% in the third plot. Although the results were
variable, it was concluded that fluazinam could be a useful tool to use
within an integrated programme of control.
2) Another study was done on the use of soil fumigation with reduced rates
of methyl bromide and the use of grafted melon plants, alone or in
combination. Results showed that among eight rootstocks tested
(_Cucurbita_ spp.), _Cucurbita maxima_ cv. Brava was best in terms of wilt
reduction and horticultural performance. The best disease control was
obtained with a combination of reduced rates of methyl bromide
(pre-planting) and the use of grafted plants (75 % to 100 % wilt reduction
in tested melon plots). Additional use of fluazinam during the growing
season (as described above) might further improve control against _M.
cannonballus_.

[According to the authors, sudden wilt of melon (_Cucumis melo_), also
known as "vine decline" and "melon collapse" occurs in many areas of the
world, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas such as the southern states
in USA, Central America, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Israel, India, and Spain.
Soil disinfestation by fumigation with methyl bromide gives good control,
but that practice is destined to be banned in the USA and Israel by 2001,
and elsewhere by 2010. The fungicide fluazinam appears to be promising for
management of sudden wilt disease as well as _Pythium aphanidermatum_ which
may be involved in the etiology of the disease, either alone or in
interaction with _M. cannonballus_. - Mod.DH
