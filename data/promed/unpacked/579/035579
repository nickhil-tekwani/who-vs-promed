[1] WHO: Americas, Europe, alert

WHO has issued a warning regarding the ongoing measles outbreaks in the Americas and Europe stating that health officials should redouble efforts to vaccinate their populations, according to an epidemiological update.

Measles was declared eliminated from the Americas in 2016 by the Pan American Health Organization and the World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO).

Culminating in a 22-year effort involving mass vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella, the Americas Region was the first in the world to have eliminated all three diseases.

However, the highly contagious nature of the measles virus and the fact that both it and the rubella virus continue to circulate in the rest of the world, means the Americas Region is now at risk of outbreaks, says the PAHO.

"I'm deeply concerned that the return of measles to Venezuela and adjoining nations Colombia and Brazil, together with new measles outbreaks in Minnesota in 2017, and now in 2018, Texas and Kansas, could represent an ominous trend for the Western Hemisphere," said Peter Hotez, MD, PhD,
FASTMH, FAAP, Dean, National School of Tropical Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine.

According to health officials, the best protection against the measles virus is the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.

In the last 5 years, the Americas Region coverage with the first dose of the MMR vaccine has ranged between 92 percent and 94 percent.

During 2018, there have been [9] countries in the Americas Region reporting confirmed cases: Antigua and Barbuda (1 case), Brazil (14 cases), Canada (4 cases), Guatemala (1 case), Mexico (4 cases), Peru (2 cases), the United States (13 cases), [Colombia (1 case)], and Venezuela (886 cases in total, 159 cases in 2018), according to the epidemiological update.

This follows 4 countries in 2017 reporting confirmed measles cases: Argentina, Canada, the United States, and Venezuela.

Separately, measles cases in the European region quadrupled in 2017.

With over 3 billion airline passengers annually, the risk of in-flight transmission of infectious diseases is an important health concern. Which means, in the United States, most of the measles cases result from international travel. The disease is brought into the United States by unvaccinated people who get infected in other countries. During 2018, there have been several measles alerts issued related to international travelers. In response, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued measles Travel Alerts for various countries.

In light of this situation, PAHO/WHO has recommended the following to its countries:
- Vaccinate to maintain 95 percent homogeneous coverage with the 1st and 2nd doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in all municipalities.
- Strengthen epidemiological surveillance in public and private health services to detect suspected cases.
- Respond quickly when an imported measles case is detected in order to prevent the reestablishment of endemic transmission of the virus; this includes activating teams to follow up on patients with measles and their contacts.
- Maintain a reserve of measles-rubella (MR) vaccines in each country of the Region for imported case-control actions.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and affects primarily children. It is transmitted by airborne droplets or via direct contact with secretions from the nose, mouth, and throat of infected individuals.

Measles can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infections, and pneumonia, particularly in children with nutritional problems and in immunocompromised patients.

Anyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of getting infected when they travel internationally.

In the USA, 2 measles vaccines are available, MMR-II and ProQuad.

The CDC Vaccine Price List (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/awardees/vaccine-management/price-list/) provides the private sector vaccine prices for general information, and vaccine discounts can be found at https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/discounts.

Most pediatricians and pharmacies offer the measles vaccines.

Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects, says the CDC. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of vaccines to the FDA or CDC.

Boyacá is the model department at the national level in epidemiological surveillance, which is why monitoring is carried out in relation to vaccination processes.

Germán Pertúz, secretary of health of Boyacá, confirmed to the LA FM that 3 minors of the municipalities of Tunja, Duitama, and Sogamoso, presented with the symptoms of measles. For this reason samples were taken and sent to the National Institute of Health for biological testing

The Secretary of Health recalled that an inspection process has been started in each of the municipalities of the department, because of the massive influx of Venezuelans.

"Thanks to that we were able to identify these 3 minors, 1 in Tunja seen in the Colsubsidio clinic, another minor in the Boyacá clinic in Duitama, and another minor in the Valle del Sol clinic in Sogamoso."

Following the sanitary health protocols for this type of procedure, the samples were transferred under strict security measures, to avoid that any agent alter the results on the study of these cases of measles.

"The samples were immediately taken and transported to the National Institute of Health," said Pertúz to LA FM. If the result is positive, the official said that efforts will be redoubled with the national vaccination day that will take place during the month [April 2018].

The secretary of health of Quindío department Cesar Augusto Rincón confirmed that the results of only 3 cases are still pending from the National Institute of Health, to determine if measles is present in the region or not. However, work is being done to enforce the vaccination scheme for minors who do not have it. "We already have the report of the National Institute of Health that 4 of the samples are negative for rubella and measles, but this does not mean that we are going to lower our guard; on the contrary, we have all the available equipment", said the secretary of health.

The official however stressed that the vaccination coverage in Quindío is 95 percent, without ignoring that there are children less than 5 years who are not fully vaccinated.

In a follow-up on the Greece measles outbreak, 2345 measles cases have been notified in Greece since the beginning of 2017. Of this total, 1390 were laboratory confirmed, 795 are probable cases meeting the clinical criteria and epidemiological link with laboratory confirmed cases, and 160 are possible cases meeting the clinical criteria.

The outbreak primarily affects Greek nationals in southern Greece. Many are young Roma children, as well as Greek adults aged 25-44 years old. Among them healthcare professionals who were unvaccinated or partly vaccinated.

Greek health officials say more cases are expected to be laboratory confirmed in the near future, and an increase of cases as well as spread in other geographical areas cannot be excluded.

So far, [3] deaths have been reported in laboratory confirmed measles cases. The 1st case concerned an 11-months old unvaccinated Roma infant, with underlying dystrophy, who died of septicemia. The 2nd case concerned a 17-year-old unvaccinated Roma, who died of encephalitis. The 3rd case is a 35-year-old female, from the general population, partially vaccinated as reported, who died of pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The recommended vaccination with the combined measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR vaccine) in children, adolescents, and adults who have not been vaccinated with the necessary doses. According to the National Vaccine Program, children, adolescents, and adults who were born after 1970 and have no history of disease should be vaccinated with 2 doses of measles vaccine.

From 2016-2018, more than 20 000 measles cases have been reported across Europe (30 EU/EEA Member States) and 57 deaths.

In the Bahrain tehsil [sub district] of Swat [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa] 4 children lost their lives due to a measles outbreak.

According to Bahrain Nazim Habibullah, 13 other affected children were shifted to Saidu Sharif Hospital in Swat.

Habibullah added that the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) teams failed to carry out vaccination in the area, which resulted in the outbreak.

Measles is a fatal disease which can be prevented by getting the affected child vaccinated first at 9 months and for the 2nd time at 15 months [of age].

According to health experts, measles is a contagious disease which can spread from one child to the other through touch, which is why parents should be careful.

[6] Australia (Western Australia): travel associated

https://www.communitynews.com.au/canning-times/news/fourth-wa-resident-reported-with-case-of-measles-acquired-overseas/


A 4th case of measles acquired overseas has been reported in a WA [Western Australia] resident.

The cases are unrelated, but all 4 infected residents were diagnosed within a 10-day period in March [2018]. 2 travellers were infected in Bali, one in Malaysia, and the other person was most likely infected in Thailand or Malaysia.

As a result of the infections, people could potentially have been exposed to measles at healthcare facilities including Bentley, Royal Perth, and Joondalup Hospitals, GP surgeries and pharmacies, and other parts of Perth including Perth Airport.

Doctors are on alert for secondary measles cases that could present up until the middle of this month [April 2018].

The spike prompted the Department of Health on 24 Mar 2018 to urge people to check and update their vaccinations prior to overseas travels from Perth.

It is recommended that the measles vaccine be considered for people travelling overseas who were born after 1965 and who do not have documentation of having had 2 doses of measles vaccine.

There may be an ongoing increased risk of measles infection in Bali.

One confirmed locally acquired case of mumps was also reported recently, with the source of the infection unknown.
