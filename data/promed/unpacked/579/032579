The paediatrics departments being operated in 2 of the 3 allied hospitals in town [Rawalpindi, Punjab province] have been receiving extraordinary influx of child patients with both upper and lower respiratory tract infections particularly after a sharp fall in mercury.

Data collected by 'The News' on Monday [15 Dec 2014] reveals that well over 80 percent of the total child patients being presented to paediatrics departments in Holy Family Hospital and Benazir Bhutto Hospital are with respiratory tract infections. As many as 70 percent of these are with upper respiratory tract infections including sore throat, cough, flu and fever, while 30 percent have lower respiratory tract infections including mild to moderate and severe pneumonia.

On average, the 2 hospitals are receiving 500 to 600 child patients daily of which nearly 400 are with complaints of respiratory tract infections, said Head of Paediatrics Department at Rawalpindi Medical College Professor Dr. Rai Muhammad Asghar while talking to 'The News' on Monday [15 Dec 2014]. He added that the paeds departments in the 2 hospitals are admitting around 50 child patients daily. We are admitting the patients who are suffering from severe pneumonia, he said.

It is important that the BBH has a capacity of 95 beds in its paeds department while the paeds department in HFH has a capacity of 120 beds. 'The News' has learnt that the bed occupancy rate in the 2 paeds departments at the 2 hospitals is more than 200 per cent as the departments are keeping 2 to 3 patients on almost all beds. When asked, Dr. Rai said the paeds departments at the HFH and BBH are following a unique policy and do not refuse admission to any child patient in need of it. Majority of admitted child patients at the paeds departments particularly below one year of age are suffering from severe pneumonia and are on oxygen therapy, he said. He explained that these patients need to be kept under continuous observation, and keeping this in mind, they are not refusing admission to any child patient suffering from severe pneumonia.

He said the incidence of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections among children can be avoided if parents take proper preventive measures well in time. The most important precautionary measure is that parents should avoid exposure of children to extreme cold, particularly in the morning and at night, he said. Children should be kept in warm places and their rooms should be kept well ventilated, said Dr. Rai. He added that children should not be exposed to any kind of smoke and dusty environment. To avoid upper and lower respiratory tract infections, it is a must to protect children from cold by using warm clothing while infants should be breastfed at least for 2 years. Parents should avoid children from getting wet to avoid pneumonia and the environment of the children should be kept clean, said Dr. Rai.

[Pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death in children worldwide, especially in low-income countries, and accounts for up to 19 percent of all deaths of children under 5 years old (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18545744). Most cases of childhood pneumonia occur in South Asia (India and Pakistan) and China (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18545744). Childhood pneumonia is usually caused by either viruses or bacteria. Bacterial causes of childhood pneumonia include _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, and _Chlamydophila pneumoniae_. However, most lower respiratory tract disease in children is viral in origin. The most common are respiratory syncytial virus or RSV, parainfluenza viruses, and influenza virus, which occur in the colder months of the year. Enteroviruses, such as enterovirus D68, occurs during the warmer summer months. Many of these potentially fatal childhood infections can be prevented, as they are caused by influenza viruses, _S. pneumoniae_ or _H. influenzae_ for which an effective vaccine is available. In addition, pneumonia caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but only 1/3rd of children with pneumonia are said to receive the antibiotics they need (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs331/en/).

RSV causes both upper and lower respiratory infection (pneumonia and bronchiolitis) in children. RSV is a very contagious and the most common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia in children younger than age 1 in the US. Almost all children are infected with the virus by 2 years of age. RSV spreads rapidly among children during outbreaks. Even after recovery, infants and children can continue to spread the virus for 1 to 3 weeks. Risk factors for RSV pneumonia are undernutrition, indoor air pollution, low birth weight, crowding and lack of measles immunization (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2647437/). In infants and very young children, RSV can be severe and require hospitalization. Some children with severe RSV are treated with an aerosolized drug called ribavirin. There is no vaccine to prevent RSV infection, but palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is used to prevent RSV infections during RSV season in infants and young children who have a higher risk for serious illness caused by RSV.

One or more of these viruses, especially RSV, is likely to be involved in the Pakistan outbreak. However, more detailed clinical, epidemiologic and microbiologic information would be needed to clarify the situation.

Holy Family Hospital (https://plus.google.com/101797232289693192254/about?hl=en) and Benazir Bhutto Hospital (https://plus.google.com/106344485355447283341/about?hl=en) are in the city of Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Rawalpindi is located 14 km (9 miles) south of the capital city of Islamabad, in the province of Punjab. - Mod.ML
