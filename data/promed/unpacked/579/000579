Multistate _E. coli_ outbreak linked to cake mix
-----------------------------------------
An ongoing _E. coli_ outbreak affecting 16 people in 12 states has been linked to cake mix. The CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the FDA are investigating the multistate outbreak of _E. coli_ O121 infections from cake mix. All those sick are female and illness dates range from 26 Feb 2021 to 21 Jun 2021.

Sick people range in age from 2 to 73 years old, with a median of 13. 75 percent are children under the age of 18. Children are more likely to have a severe _E. coli_ infection. Of 16 people with information available, 7 have been hospitalized. 1 person has developed a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) but no deaths have been reported.

Of the 8 people interviewed, 6 reported tasting or eating raw batter made with a cake mix. People said they bought different varieties and brands. Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska and Ohio have 2 patients while Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and Washington all have one. Whole genome sequencing showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This means patients in this outbreak likely got sick from the same food.

FDA is doing a traceback investigation using purchase records from locations where sick people bought cake mix to try to determine a common brand or production facility. The CDC is advising people not to taste or eat raw cake batter, whether made from a mix or homemade. Eating raw cake batter can make you sick as it can contain harmful bacteria. Bacteria are killed only when raw batter is baked or cooked.

The agency also told the public not to make milkshakes with products that contain raw foods such as cake mix, flour, or eggs, to keep raw foods such as cake mix, flour, or eggs separate from ready-to-eat foods and to follow the recipe or package directions for cooking or baking.

[This is certainly likely to be the same outbreak of serotype O121 EHEC that was reported earlier in July 2021 on ProMED. ProMED has previously reported on outbreaks of this serotype associated with ground bison meat, raw flour and sprouts. Other enteric pathogens (_Salmonella_ and hepatitis A) have been reported here also as spread by cake mixes. Although the ingredient in the cake in this ongoing outbreak is not yet established, raw flour may well be the source. Not eating any raw dough or batter, whether homemade or from a mix is always a good idea. - Mod.LL
