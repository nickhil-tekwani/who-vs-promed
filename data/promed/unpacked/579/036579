A report reaching Concord Times indicated that a number of staff of Medicine San Frontiers (MSF) have allegedly died of Lassa fever in the municipality of Bo [Southern Province].

The report stated that a nurse, driver and a community health officer, alongside her 2 children, lost their lives after being allegedly infected with the disease; a situation which has left some section of the Bo population worried.

MSF's project coordinator in Bo, John Mark, told Concord Times in an interview that they were doing all they could to curb the infection and death rate among their staff.

"It is really difficult to ascertain whether it is our staff or patients brought to the referral clinic that are responsible for this dreadful disease," Mark said. "Suspected Lassa fever patients' blood specimens are usually taken to the Kenema government hospital Lassa department for testing, and if proven positive or infected, they (staff) will be transferred to Kenema for treatment."

He maintained that their nurses at the Gondama clinic use preventive measures and gear to keep themselves free from the Lassa fever disease and any other dreadful disease(s).

[Lassa fever virus (LFV) is endemic in West Africa, although ProMED-mail has not received reports of cases there since 2010. Lassa fever has not as yet been confirmed in these individuals. More information on the results of laboratory tests for LFV would be greatly appreciated.

Presuming these individuals do have Lassa fever, it is not clear if these unfortunate victims acquired their LFV infections in the hospital or elsewhere, probably from environments contaminated by the multimammate rodent reservoir host. LFV infections are usually not fatal; some 80 per cent of human infections are asymptomatic. Non-fatal cases may have severe multisystem disease, where the virus affects several organs such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys. The incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 6 to 21 days. More detailed information can be accessed at http://www.who.int/csr/disease/lassafever/en/.
