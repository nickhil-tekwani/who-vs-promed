Foot-and-mouth disease has claimed the lives of over 4700 cattle in Kerala [state] after its outbreak a few months ago, State Agriculture Minister KP Mohanan told the state Assembly on Monday [6 Jan 2014].

Replying to a submission in this regard, he said that the disease is now under control due to the effective remedial steps taken by the government. A sum of Rs 1.9 crore [INR 19 million; about USD 304 931] has been distributed to farmers who lost cattle as compensation. Rs 20 lakh [INR 2 million; about USD 32 098] has been allotted to districts to initiate measures to check spread of disease, he added.

Free treatment and vaccination is being carried out as part of the measures, he added.

[On 11 Dec 2013, the number of bovines that had died in Kerala state due to foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) was publicly published to be around 2000 head (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20131215.2117504). The number has, reportedly, more than doubled since.

FMD is regarded endemic in India; therefore, no immediate notifications on outbreaks are required by the OIE. The total 2013 number of clinical cases and of mortality in the 4 affected Indian states (Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh) are anticipated to be included in India's due annual report.

Details of the vaccine strain(s) applied and their observed efficacy (or otherwise) are expected as well. - Mod.AS
