[After 2 years of significant WPV1 activity in Pakistan and Afghanistan, WPV1 transmission continues, but apparently at a slower pace. That being said, positive environmental samples mean that the virus is actively circulating. But, 2020 was a major year for cVDPV outbreaks with a total to date of 1067 confirmed AFP cases associated with circulating vaccine derived polioviruses and in 2021, as of 3 Mar, 13 cases have already been reported. Countries involved included Eurasia (Tajikistan), Middle East (Egypt, Yemen), Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Malaysia), Africa (Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Somalia. South Sudan, Sudan, Togo), and the Pacific (Philippines).

[3] Comment on cVDPV
Date: Wed 24 Feb 2021
From: T Jacob John <tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in> [edited]


[My sincere apologies for the delay in posting this update and comment from Dr T Jacob John. - Mod.MPP]

The case-to-infection ratio of wild poliovirus type 2 [WPV2] is in the range of 1 to 1000-2000. So one case of WPV2 polio means 1000-2000 silent infections. cVDPV has a lower risk of paralysis, the case-to-infection ratio may be between 1 to 5000-10 000. That is the reason why we cannot rely on AFP surveillance for detecting the prevalence of cVDPV-2 but need sewage surveillance.

In 2020, if there were 1048 confirmed cases of polio due to cVDPV-2, that means the size of the silent epidemic was at least 1048 x 5000 = 5 240 000 [updating this calculation to 1067 cases, 5 335 000 infections - Mod.MPP]

Waiting for novel OPV [oral poliovirus vaccines] is not enough. There is no guarantee the eradication program can eradicate cVDPV-2 in one or 2 years. If we had 5 million cVDPV infections in 2020, the probability that it will further de-attenuate and become genotypically and phenotypically closer to wild virus than vaccine virus is high. Immediate and widespread IPV [inactivated polio vaccine] by campaign is the necessary intervention now.

If that is not operationally feasible, EPI [Expanded Program on Immunization] must revise its immunisation policy to recommend "at least 2 doses" of IPV, stand-alone or combination vaccine. I say this because "at least 1 dose of IPV" is part of the eradication program.

If stand-alone, then 14 weeks and 9 months of age should be ideal, to match with 2 contacts for other vaccines, or if combination vaccine, 3 doses as per the current EPI schedule. This is ethically necessary. No excuses like high cost or low coverage, etc. should be used to delay this decision. No child ever had polio after 2 well-timed IPV doses or 3 EPI schedule IPV doses. Preventing polio is the primary duty of the eradication program; this will not in any way interfere with the interventions deemed necessary by the eradication program.

[ProMED would like to thank Dr T Jacob John for his very insightful comment. Clearly, the vaccine (OPV) has become a major part of the polio problem globally with cVDPV cases exploding in many countries (see sections [1] and [2] above. The call to change vaccines to IPV should be loud and clear. Arguments on the cost of the change should include calculations of the cost of the cases of cVDPV associated disease and the cost of the repeated mop up outbreak control vaccination campaigns. - Mod.MPP]

[4] Cameroon: impact of COVID-19

Cameroon says 2 polio cases discovered in the capital, Yaounde, 3 weeks ago are a consequence of people refusing to inoculate their children for fear of being infected by COVID-19. The central African state has redeployed health teams to all towns and villages to ask parents to vaccinate their children.

Cameroon says it has dispatched health workers to 360 hospitals as part of an awareness campaign against polio. Tetanye Ekoe, president of Cameroon's National Polio Certification Commission, said the awareness teams will teach communities to observe hygiene and to intensify routine immunization, and epidemiological surveillance.

He said the discovery of 2 type 2 polio cases in Yaounde 3 weeks ago should serve as a wake-up call for people who have turned their backs on polio vaccination. He said it is an illusion to think that the government is hiding behind vaccinations to harm its citizens. Ekoe said he is calling on all Cameroonians to inoculate their children and convince others to take their children to vaccination centers. He said the emergence of polio shows a weak collective immunity. Ekoe said some polio cases may still be undetected because many parents have not been bringing their children to the hospitals out of fear of COVID-19 infection.

Cameroon was declared polio-free in 2015, but in 2019, the government of the central African state announced a resurgence on its northern border with Nigeria. The new polio cases were reported in Cameroon in the middle of the 2nd wave of the coronavirus pandemic.

This month [March 2021] Cameroon's Public Health Ministry reported that the number of people testing positive for COVID-19 had increased from 26 000 to 39 000 between January [2021] and February [2021].

In December [2020], the government said more than 240 000 children had not received polio vaccines since COVID-19 cases were first reported in Cameroon last March [2020]. The government said parents were refusing to take their children to the hospitals for inoculation because of fear of the coronavirus.

Ekoe said rumors last month [February 2021] that the government would secretly vaccinate all Cameroonians against COVID-19 further discouraged people who are scared of the vaccine from visiting hospitals.

Prime minister Joseph Dion Ngute denied in a message Friday [5 Mar 2021] that Cameroon is vaccinating all its citizens who visit hospitals against COVID-19. Ngute said Cameroon is still negotiating to buy a million coronavirus vaccine doses, which will not be administered to people who do not want them. "Once this vaccine become available, vaccination shall be voluntary," he said. "I would like to note that although vaccination is voluntary and not compulsory, the government encourages all Cameroonians to be vaccinated when the time comes in order to acquire the immunity that will enable our community to protect itself against COVID-19 for a return to normalcy."

On [25 Aug 2020], the World Health Organization announced that wild poliovirus had been eradicated from Africa after 4 consecutive years without any reported cases and massive efforts to immunize children. The WHO said polio-free Africa was a historic moment, moving the world closer to achieving global polio eradication.

The WHO statement said only Pakistan and Afghanistan continue to see wild poliovirus transmission.

Polio affects mostly young children. Cameroon did not say if the new cases were detected in children or adults.

[Polio vaccination activities are on the list of activities suffering collateral damage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the early stages of the pandemic, vaccination activities were interrupted, now there is fear on the part of the population that visiting health facilities for vaccination will put them at high risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. A very sad outcome of the pandemic. - Mod.MPP]
