The state's 1st human case of West Nile virus [disease] this year has been
confirmed in Montgomery County, health officials said. The case was
reported on Monday in north Montgomery County, said Jim Schuermann, an
epidemologist with the Texas Department of State Health Services.

The victim has West Nile fever, a less serious illness than the
neuroinvasive form of West Nile [virus infection], Schuermann said.
Information about the victim's residence, name, gender and age was not
released because of privacy rules.

West Nile disease is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected
mosquito, which gets the virus by biting infected birds. The virus has been
known to cause mild flulike symptoms, including fever, headache, sore
throat and body aches. The virus also can cause serious neurological
symptoms including stiff neck, visual problems, body tremors, seizures and
mental confusion, and, in severe cases, meningitis or encephalitis. In some
cases, it can be fatal.

Schuermann said West Nile fever can be intense, with severe headaches and
chronic weakness and fatigue that last for several weeks. Health officials
said about 80 percent of people who become infected with the virus do not
know they have it because they don't experience symptoms. Less than 1
percent will actually become ill, said Pat Buzbee, Montgomery County's
director of Environmental Health Services.

West Nile season typically starts in the summer, with mid-August through
mid-September being peak months because they're the hottest and driest
months. But it is not unusual to see cases early, Schuermann said. "We see
cases as early as March and as late as December," he said.

Last year, the state had 170 neuroinvasive and 90 fever cases, and 17
deaths, according to state health records.

To protect against the virus, health officials urge people to stay indoors
in the early morning and evening hours because that's when mosquitoes are
most active. People should also wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants
outdoors and use insect repellent with the chemical DEET.
