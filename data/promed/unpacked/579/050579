The Okeechobee County Health Department says 2 horses have tested
positive for eastern equine encephalitis [EEE]. Officials say this
represents an increased activity of the mosquito-borne illness this
summer [2010] .

Pet owners should speak with their veterinarians for guidance to
protect their animals from EEE and West Nile Virus.

Doctors recommend people should take the following steps to protect
themselves from being bitten by mosquitoes:
- Avoid being outside at dusk or dawn when mosquitoes are active.
- Wear long sleeve pants and shirts to cover the skin.
- Use an insect repellent that contains DEET.
- Get rid of any standing water on your property when mosquitoes breed.

The Florida Department of Health watches for mosquito-borne illnesses
including West Nile virus infections, eastern equine encephalitis, St
Louis encephalitis, malaria, and dengue. Officials study dead birds
to measure the spread of the diseases.

Please report dead birds to the Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission at <http://myfwc.com/bird/>.

Below are frequently asked questions about EEE provided by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:
- What is eastern equine encephalitis (EEE)? EEE is a disease that is
caused by a virus spread by infected mosquitoes. EEE virus (EEEV) is
one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause
inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).
- How do people get infected? EEEV is transmitted through the bite of
an infected mosquito. Disease transmission does not occur directly
from person to person.
- Who is at risk for infection? Anyone in an area where the virus is
circulating can get infected with EEEV.
- How soon do people get sick after getting bitten by an infected
mosquito? It takes 4 to 10 days after the bite of an infected
mosquito to develop symptoms of EEE.
- What are the symptoms? Severe cases can begin with the sudden onset
of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The illness may then
progress into disorientation, seizures, and coma. Approximately a
third of patients who develop EEE die, and many of those who survive
have mild to severe brain damage.
- How is EEE diagnosed? Diagnosis is based on tests of blood or spinal fluid.
- What is the treatment for EEE? There is no vaccine or preventive
drug and there is no specific treatment for EEE. Antibiotics are not
effective against viruses. Severe illnesses are treated by supportive
therapy which may include hospitalization, respiratory support, and IV fluids.
- What should I do if I think a family member might have EEE? Consult
your health care provider for proper diagnosis.
