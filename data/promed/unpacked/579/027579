Doctors have advised people not to consume the meat of sick pigs, following the death of one person who ate infected pork. Another person is in critical condition.

Nguyen Trung Cap, head of the Emergency Department at the Central Hospital for Tropical Diseases (CHTD), said the department received 2 patients infected with the parasite _Trichinella_.

The patients hailed from Lai Chu Province and were brought to the hospital after suffering from exhaustion and painful muscles. They could not swallow anything and found it difficult to speak, he said. Despite being treated at the intensive care with specific treatment, one of the patients died from cardiac arrest after being hospitalised for 2 days. "The other patient is still under treatment. He has suffered respiratory failure and is unable to eat due to sore throat," Cap said, adding that the patient has lost 10 kg [approx 22 lb] in just a few days.

According to the patients' relatives, the family had slaughtered a sick pig early last month. They prepared tiet canh (a delicacy with raw pig's blood) and a dish with uncooked pork. After 5 days, 5 men in the family complained of stomach ache, diarrhoea, high fever and severe pain in the muscles. The patients underwent treatment at local hospitals for 5 days, but their condition worsened and 2 of them were later transferred to CHTD.

According to Cap, helminthiasis in humans is caused by a roundworm named _Trichinella_, which is present in many animals. People who eat raw or undercooked poultry are infected with _Trichinella spiralis_, but almost everyone can get helminthiasis.

To prevent such diseases, people should not eat tiet canh and dishes made from uncooked meat as they contain many types of bacteria and viruses which cause diseases, Cap said. He pointed out people should avoid buying pork with an unusual red colour as it might be the meat of sick pigs.

[Infection with _Trichinella_ is well documented in Vietnam. For a recent review see: "Ng-Nguyen D et al. A systematic review of taeniasis, cysticercosis and trichinellosis in Vietnam. Parasit Vectors. 2017 Mar 21;10(1):150". The continuous risk of _Trichinella_ infection from domestic pork is probably due to feeding kitchen offal and the free roaming of the pigs.

So far, only _Trichinella spiralis_ has been identified in the country: "Vu Thi N al. The hidden burden of trichinellosis in Vietnam: a postoutbreak epidemiological study. Biomed Res Int. 2013;2013:149890.
