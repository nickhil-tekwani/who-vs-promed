Anthrax affects 15 families in Koraput district in Orissa
---------------------------------------------------------
At least 15 families fell ill due to anthrax in the tribal dominated
Koraput district of Orissa. Locals said that they fell ill after
consuming contaminated meat of the cattle. Anthrax, a highly
infectious animal disease, spreads every year in Koraput district at
the beginning of the raining season.

[This is just a 1.5 minute news video clip. It seems that these
anthrax outbreaks are a regular occurrence in the area and partly due
to poor compliance by the locals who are unenthusiastic about getting
their livestock vaccinated. The video clip shows the latter in
extremely poor and malnourished condition. If the animals are
vaccinated when in this condition there would be a minimal protective
response. The cattle need to be proactively vaccinated at the end of
the wet season and before the dry season sets in when they are in
good condition and able to produce antibodies.

The clip shows a number of men with cutaneous lesions on the backs of
their fingers, presumably from exposure when butchering sick cattle.
