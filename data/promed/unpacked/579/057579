Pakistan: 12-year-old girl hospitalized in Islamabad with CCHFV infection
-----------------------------------------------
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) has again struck the federal
capital, resulting in closure of the emergency ward at the Federal
Government Service Hospital (commonly known as the Polyclinic), sending
shock-waves through the hospital's visitors. The doctors at the emergency
ward closed the ward as a precautionary measure after a 12-year-old girl
tested positive for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus infection on Fri
22 Apr 2005. The ward will be reopened for normal operations on Mon 25 Apr
2005.
According to hospital sources, the girl, a resident of Dhoke Mitial on the
outskirts of Islamabad, was brought to the Polyclinic in critical
condition. Doctors conducted several medical tests on her and suspected
that she was suffering from Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Dr. Sharif
Asturi, in-charge of the hospital's blood bank, told Daily Times that CCHFV
was found in the girl's blood. He said there was continuous bleeding from
her mouth and nose when she was brought to the hospital. Dr. Asturi said
that girl's blood samples had been sent to the National Institute of Health
from where they had been forwarded to South Africa for confirmation of the
diagnosis.
A number of patients and their attendants feared that they might be
affected. The hospital administration closed the emergency ward for 2 days
because of the presence of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever patient.
Later, the girl was moved to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences
where she was kept in an observation room. According to hospital sources,
her condition is improving; however, the doctors concerned were not
available for comment.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a member of the genus
_Nairovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_ of segmented genome
negative-sense RNA viruses. It is the cause of a zoonotic disease that for
many years was recognized only in Central Asia and eastern Europe. CCHFV is
known now to be present throughout Asia, the Middle East and Africa. In
recent years, CCHFV-associated disease has been particularly prevalent in
countries bordering the Persian Gulf, where traditional sheep slaughtering
and butchering practices continue. The virus is maintained by a cycle
involving transovarial and transstadial transmission in _Hyalomma_ spp. and
related ticks. The larval and nymphal ticks become infected during feeding
on small mammals and birds and the adults during feeding on wild and
domestic ruminants. Infection of wild and domestic ruminants results in
abundant production of CCHFV. Remarkably, there is no evidence of clinical
disease in animals other than humans, where the outcome can be a severe
hemorrhagic fever.
The circumstances whereby the girl contracted CCHFV infection are not
stated. Further information would be appreciated. The closure of the
emergency ward is a prudent measure, because nosocomial transmission of
CCHFV infection in hospitals in Pakistan is not unknown. In 2002, a female
doctor in a hospital in Rawalpindi contracted CCHFV infection from a
patient and died. 2 doctors involved in her treatment also contracted
infection; both survived. Previously, in 1974, a physician died in
Rawalpindi General Hospital as a result of CCHFV infection contracted from
patients. - Mod.CP]
