Acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in children - Multi-country
----------------------------------------------------------------
Outbreak at a glance
--------------------
A total of 650 probable cases of acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in children have been reported to WHO from 33 countries in 5 WHO Regions between 5 Apr and 26 May 2022. The aetiology of this severe acute hepatitis remains unknown and under investigation; the cases are more clinically severe and a higher proportion develops acute liver failure compared with previous reports of acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in children. It remains to be established whether and where the detected cases are above-expected baseline levels. WHO assesses the risk at the global level as moderate.

Outbreak description
--------------------
Following the WHO Multicountry Disease Outbreak News on Acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology published on 23 Apr 2022, there have been continuing reports of cases of acute hepatitis of unknown cause among young children.

As of 26 May 2022, 650 probable cases fitting the WHO case definition have been reported to WHO from 33 countries in 5 WHO Regions, with 99 additional cases pending classification. The majority of reported cases (n = 374; 58%) are from the WHO European Region (22 countries), with 222 (34%) cases from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland alone. Probable cases and cases pending classification have also been reported from the Region of the Americas (n = 240, including 216 cases in the USA), Western Pacific Region (n = 34), the South-East Asia Region (n = 14) and Eastern Mediterranean Region (n = 5) (Figure 1, Table 1 [for the figure, see original URL, for the table, see below - Mod.LL]).

WHO working case definition
---------------------------
Confirmed: N/A at present [27 May 2022]
Probable: A person presenting with an acute hepatitis (non hep A-E) with serum transaminase > 500 IU/L (AST or ALT), who is 16 years and younger, since 1 Oct 2021
Epi-linked: A person presenting with an acute hepatitis (non hep A-E) of any age who is a close contact of a probable case, since 1 Oct 2021
If hepatitis A-E serology results are awaited, but other criteria met, these can be reported and will be classified as "pending classification". Cases with other explanations for their clinical presentation are discarded.
Delta testing is not required, as it is only undertaken in persons who are HBsAg positive to establish presence of co-infection.

The virus testing for other countries is either not known, < 5, or 0 and the number tested unknown [WHO reports < 5 without giving finite numbers. Those numbers seem to be known to account for the total numbers of suspected cases and transplants. - Mod.LL]

Out of the 650 probable cases, at least 38 (6%) children have required transplants, and 9 (1%) deaths have been reported to WHO.

According to the latest Joint Surveillance Report by the WHO Regional Office for Europe (EURO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on cases from EU/EEA countries which have been reported through the European Surveillance System (TESSy), as of 20 May 2022:
- Three quarters (75.4%) of cases are < 5 years of age.
- Of 156 cases with information on hospital admission, 22 (14.1%) were admitted to an intensive care unit. Of the 117 cases for which this information was available, 14 (12%) have received a liver transplant.
- Overall, 181 cases were tested for adenovirus by any specimen type, of which 110 (60.8%) tested positive. The positivity rate was the highest in whole blood specimens (69.5%).
- Of the 188 cases PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2, 23 (12.2%) tested positive. Serology results for SARS-CoV-2 were only available for 26 cases, of which 19 (73.1%) had a positive finding.
- Of the 63 cases with data on COVID-19 vaccination, 53 (84.1%) were unvaccinated.

Most of the reported cases appear to be unrelated and extensive epidemiological investigations are underway to identify common exposures, risk factors or links between cases. Two pairs of cases have been reported as epidemiologically linked in Scotland, and linked cases have also been reported in the Netherlands.

Based on the working case definition for probable cases, laboratory testing has excluded hepatitis A-E viruses in these children. SARS-CoV-2 and/or adenovirus have been detected in a number of the cases, although the data reported to WHO are incomplete. The UK has recently observed an increase in adenovirus activity, which is co-circulating with SARS-CoV-2, though the role of these viruses in the pathogenesis is not yet clear.

Further detailed epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, histopathological and toxicological investigations of the possible cause(s) of these cases are underway by several national authorities, research networks and across different working groups in WHO and with partners. Additional investigations are also planned to ascertain whether and where the detected cases are above-expected baseline levels.

Public health response
----------------------
- Clinical and public health incident responses have been activated across the affected regions to coordinate case finding with investigation into the cause of illness in these children.
- Further investigations by various national authorities are ongoing to include more detailed exposure histories, toxicology testing, and additional virological/microbiological tests.
- Additionally, a case-control study to establish the frequency of adenovirus detection in the cases hospitalised with acute hepatitis compared to those hospitalised for other reasons is underway in the UK. Research actions are also being coordinated across the WHO regions and with partners.
- WHO continues to support sharing of information with professional networks and specialist liver units.
- Guidance is being developed to support Member States with diagnostics, case investigation and reporting, clinical characterization and clinical management of acute liver failure in children.
- The initial survey of pediatric and liver centres conducted mainly in Europe, has been expanded to establish whether the number of current cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in children is above background rates in multiple countries or only certain countries.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
WHO assesses the risk at the global level as moderate considering that:
- The aetiology of this severe acute hepatitis remains unknown and under investigation; the cases are more clinically severe and a higher proportion develops acute liver failure compared with previous reports of acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in children;
- Limited epidemiological, laboratory, histopathological and clinical information is currently available to WHO;
- The actual number of cases may be underestimated in some settings, in part due to the limited surveillance capacity in place;
- The source and mode of transmission of the potential aetiologic agent(s) has not yet been determined, and so the likelihood of further spread cannot be fully assessed;
- Although there are no available reports of healthcare-associated infections, human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out as there have been a few reports of epidemiologically linked cases.

Adenovirus has been found in 75% of the cases tested in the UK, but the data for other countries are incomplete. Of the small number of samples that have so far been typed, a majority have been confirmed for Type 41 adenovirus (in the UK, in 27 of 35 cases with an available result). Adenovirus associated virus 2 (AAV-2) has also been detected in a small number of cases in the UK using meta-genomics in liver and blood samples. However, many of the remaining cases did not have appropriate samples taken, highlighting the importance of appropriate sampling (whole blood) to further characterize the type of adenovirus detected. Additionally, Type 41 adenovirus infection has not previously been linked to such a clinical presentation in otherwise healthy children.

While adenovirus is a plausible hypothesis as part of the pathogenesis mechanism, further investigations are ongoing for the causative agent; adenovirus infection (which generally causes mild self-limiting gastrointestinal or respiratory infections in young children) does not fully explain the more severe clinical picture observed with these cases. Factors such as increased susceptibility among young children following a lower level of circulation of adenovirus during the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential emergence of a novel adenovirus, SARS-CoV-2 co-infection or a complication of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to superantigen-mediated immune cell activation, proposed a causal mechanism of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children that needs to be further investigated. Hypotheses related to side effects from COVID-19 vaccines are currently not supported as most of the affected children did not receive these vaccines. Other infectious and non-infectious explanations as independent or contributory factors need to be excluded to fully assess and manage the risk. It is important to note that the current apparent association identified with adenovirus could be an incidental finding due to enhanced laboratory testing in association with increased levels of community transmission of adenovirus. This will be further clarified with the expansion of adenovirus testing to other cases beyond Europe and the USA, and reporting of the findings from the UKHSA case-control study currently underway.

The absence of a confirmed aetiology poses additional challenges in some countries, including implementation of WHO's case definition and further diagnostic exclusion, due to limited testing capacity, including for Hepatitis A-E viruses and adenovirus. The presence of cases of acute hepatitis in children cannot be ruled out in countries where cases have not been detected or reported yet, but it is unlikely that symptomatic and severely ill case patients requiring hospitalization would remain undetected.

WHO advice
----------
Member States are strongly encouraged to identify, investigate and report potential cases fitting the case definition above. Core epidemiological and risk factor information can be collected and submitted by Member States to WHO and partner agencies through agreed reporting mechanisms (e.g. IHR, the TESSy platform in the European Region, and others). WHO is developing a clinical case reporting form to support data collection through the existing WHO Global Clinical Data Platform.

Whole blood, serum, urine, stool, respiratory and liver biopsy (if available) samples should be undertaken for all cases meeting the case definition. Especially if testing capacity is limited to conduct a full investigation of the cause, facilities should collect and store samples for future testing, typing, and/or referral testing, as capacity limitations necessitate. WHO is developing interim guidance and establishing a network of regional and global referral labs to support Member States with laboratory testing.

Any epidemiological links between/among the cases might provide clues for tracking the source of illness. Temporal and geographical information of cases, as well as their contacts should be reviewed for potential risk factors. There is an urgent need to gather additional information to assess the potential role of infections, including current adenovirus and on current and past SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as investigate other potential explanatory/contributing factors (either other infections, toxins, medications, or other underlying diseases(s)).

For the prevention of adenovirus and other common infections, perform regular hand washing and respiratory hygiene.

Until more is known, general infection prevention and control practices include:
- Perform frequent hand hygiene, using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand-gel
- Avoid crowded spaces and maintain a distance from others
- Ensure good ventilation when indoors
- Wear a well-fitted mask covering your mouth and nose when recommended
- Cover coughs and sneezes
- Use safe water for drinking
- Follow safe food handling and cooking practices
- Regular cleaning of surfaces you frequently touch with your hands
- Stay home when unwell and seek medical attention
- Health facilities should adhere to standard precautions and implement contact and droplet precautions for suspected or probable cases.

In children with acute hepatitis, the main concern is to identify cases early to ensure optimal case management and to determine the cause, since management and control measures and capacities will depend on the specific causative agent. While most countries have the capacity for medical treatment of acute hepatitis, this is not true for liver transplantation capacity or for intensive support and care for liver failure.

WHO is closely monitoring the situation and supporting international coordination working with Member States and partners.

[This WHO update provides up-to-date numbers and presents a reasonable discussion regarding possible etiologies. More work is clearly needed. Minimal data is available regarding recent SARS-CoV-2 infection and it is not clear how many of the cases were retrospectively found or are truly new since the WHO last report. The epicurve from the UK was suggesting a downward trends based on date of symptom of symptoms per epidemiological week. It is not entirely clear that this is continuing and no such data has been reported from the USA where the 2nd most cases have occurred.

Indonesia seems to have reported more cases than are noted here (see below). - Mod.LL]

Another 25 British children are struck down with mysterious hepatitis
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Another 25 British children have fallen sick with hepatitis of unknown origin as the mysterious outbreak continues. Health officials announced the new cases today [27 May 2022], bringing the cumulative UK total to 222 since the first was noted in January [2022].

Of the confirmed patients, 158 were in England, 31 in Scotland, 17 in Wales and 16 in Northern Ireland. They are predominantly in children under 5 -- but a small number of children aged over 10 have also been struck down.

Scientists are still puzzled by what is causing the life-threatening liver disease, with weakened immunity to the common cold because of lockdowns still thought to be one of the chief culprits. The complication has been spotted in hundreds of children in Europe, the USA, South America, the Middle East and Asia. At least 12 youngsters have died and dozens needed liver transplants. No children have died in the UK.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it is still investigating to find out what is behind the mysterious outbreak -- with the usual hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses excluded from laboratory test results. Scientists are still puzzled about what is causing the illness, which has been spotted in the US, Western Europe and other countries.

The main theory is that the spate of hepatitis cases are being triggered by a group of viruses that normally cause the common cold, known as adenoviruses. Scientists are probing whether a mutated strain of adenovirus has evolved to become more severe, or if a lack of social mixing during the pandemic weakened children's immunity. They also have not been able to rule out an old COVID-19 infection being involved.

New cases appear to be slowing, with the 25 recorded in the 9 days up to [25 May 2022] down 26% on the 34 recorded in the 6 days up to [16 May 2022]. Dr Tassos Grammatikopoulos, a consultant at King's College Hospital in London who has treated some of the sick children, last week said the UK 'seems to be past the peak' of the outbreak.

Dr Renu Bindra, senior medical advisor at UKHSA, said: 'Our investigations continue to suggest an association with adenovirus, and we are exploring this link, along with other possible contributing factors including prior infections such as COVID-19. We are working with other countries who are also seeing new cases to share information and learn more about these infections.' She added: 'The likelihood of children developing hepatitis remains extremely low. Maintaining normal hygiene measures, including making sure children regularly wash their hands properly, helps to reduce the spread of many common infections, including adenovirus. We continue to remind everyone to be alert to the signs of hepatitis -- particularly jaundice, look for a yellow tinge in the whites of the eyes -- and contact your doctor if you are concerned.'

The US has recorded 216 cases across 37 states, with Mississippi and Utah the latest to be added to the growing list. No new deaths or liver transplants were reported over the last 7 days, the CDC revealed in their weekly update with the totals remaining at 14 transplants and 6 deaths, respectively.

Globally, the UK has now recorded the most fatalities and suspected cases out of any nation -- although this may be because of stronger surveillance than other nations.

While mild liver inflammation is not uncommon in children, severe illness as seen in these cases is. Dr Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor in medical microbiology and infectious diseases at the University of Manitoba, Canada, said experts are continuing to investigate the outbreak across the globe. He told The Guardian: 'The playing field is changing on an hour-to-hour basis. Inch by inch, we're starting to figure out what this problem is. But I don't think we have all those pieces of the puzzle yet to say "Ok, this is what we think is going on".'

36 additional children confirmed with unknown hepatitis
-------------------------------------------------------
The CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/investigation/hepatitis-unknown-cause/updates.html) has been investigating the cause of an unusually high number of acute hepatitis cases in children since October 2021. As of 27 May 2022, there is no known association with travel, COVID-19, or hepatitis viruses (A to E) in these children. The CDC recently confirmed the number of Persons Under Investigation (PUI) has reached 216 in 38 states or territories. This is an increase of about 36 in just a week.

'While this may appear to be a large increase in patients under investigation, it's important to understand that the vast majority of these are what we consider 'retrospective' patients,' said the CDC on 18 May 2022. 'Most of these cases involve children (average age 3) that are just now being reported, rather than new cases of hepatitis -- so not all are recent, and some may ultimately wind up not being linked to this current investigation. Additionally, there have been no reported deaths since February 2022, and the proportion of patients requiring liver transplants has gone down to around 9% since [5 May 2022]. The likelihood of children developing hepatitis remains extremely low.'

Although it is said that a "vast majority" of the cases were found retrospectively, it is not at all clear that a true epi-curve of cases by 1st day of symptoms over time has ever been shown. Much more serological data regarding adenovirus, active COVID-19 and previous COVID-19 data has been forthcoming from the UK than the USA. - Mod.LL]

Children hepatitis: 9 possible cases reported in kids in Illinois, health officials say
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Illinois has 9 potential cases of severe hepatitis in children under 10, health officials said. That number is up from just 3 cases reported last month [April 2022].

The cases date back to January [2022], and the most recent had the onset of symptoms in May [2022], IDPH [Illinois Department of Health] said.

Two-thirds of the children tested positive for adenovirus, which is a common virus that typically causes cold or flu-like illness, health officials said. Five patients were reported in northern Illinois, 2 were in the western part of the state and one each was reported in the central and southern parts of the state. State health officials said all of them were hospitalized and one needed a liver transplant, but no deaths were reported.

The Ministry of Health (Kemenkes) has provided the latest update on the development of mysterious acute hepatitis cases in Indonesia.

This was conveyed by the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Health, Dr Mohammad Syahril, Sp.P, MPH, in an online press conference, Tuesday (24 May 2022). Currently, Indonesia has 35 suspected cases.

"As per our national situation, as of 23 May [2022] at 16.00, the cumulative cases are 35 cases, 19 have been discounted or discarded, and currently there are 16 probable cases of severe hepatitis of unknown cause," explained Syahril. Syahril also said that as of 19 May 2022, Indonesia had 14 confirmed cases.

[Until a definitive cause is found, it remains to be shown how many of the reported cases are due to the same etiology and how many subclinical or mild cases have occurred. The lack of clusters of cases is not easily explainable but genetic differences in individuals may be playing a role.

An example of this related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is illustrated by:

Abstract
--------
"Clinical outcome upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ranges from silent infection to lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We have found enrichment in rare variants predicted to be loss-of-function (LOF) at the 13 human loci known to govern Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity to influenza virus in 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia relative to 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection. By testing these and other rare variants at these 13 loci, we experimentally defined LOF variants underlying autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant deficiencies in 23 patients (3.5%) 17 to 77 years of age. We show that human fibroblasts with mutations affecting this circuit are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity can underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with no prior severe infection."

Dr. Casanova, the senior author on this paper has published many papers showing that subtle genetic changes can be associated with more severe disease due to a variety of pathogens. - Mod.LL
