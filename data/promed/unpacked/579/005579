Russia: Meningitis outbreak in Khabarovsk
-----------------------------------------
According to reports in the Russian press on Tue 29 Aug 2006, an outbreak
of meningitis has occurred in the Russian Far East border region of
Khabarovsk, with hundreds infected. In the 2 principal border cities of
Khabarovsk and Komsomolsk-on-the-Amur, a total of over 700 people have been
infected, most of them children under 14 years of age. The local
authorities are considering whether to delay the start of the school year
to prevent spread of the disease in schools. Local health care workers say
many of the children became infected by drinking unclean water. The virus
was then transmitted in the population through droplets of saliva.

Russian Far East: outbreak of viral meningitis among children in Khabarovsk
-----------------------------------------------
The start of the school year may be delayed in schools of the Khabarovsk
Area as a result of an outbreak of viral meningitis. According to Vladimir
Ott, head of administration at Rospotrebnadzor, the issue of a delayed
start of the school year will be considered on Wed 30 Aug 2006, taking into
account the epidemiological situation.
More than 800 cases of meningitis in children have been registered in the
area since the end of June 2006. Usually, about a few hundred children are
infected in the region during the summer. The source of infection is
usually the river Amur, where the microbiological and virological
indicators are not favorable at this time of year. Children may have
contracted the infection when swimming in pools or by drinking unboiled tap
water. The infection may be spread subsequently by air-droplets.
No kindergarten, resort camps or other institutions for children in the
area have been closed due to the outbreak. Teachers and doctors ensure that
all precautions are taken to protect children from infection. Unsupervised
children are at risk of infection as a rule. Most cases occurred in the
Khabarovsk, Komsomolsk-on-Amur and Nanayskiy Regions.
Currently, there are about 150 children with a diagnosis of meningitis in
the infectious diseases units of pediatric hospitals in Khabarovsk. Since
the end of July 2006, there were 323 children with this diagnosis in
Khabarovsk. Public health doctors have recommended the parents keep their
children away from shows and cultural events. Prohibition of swimming in
the river Amur has been in force since the beginning of summer.
Viral meningitis is a seasonal infection in the area. Usually, transmission
is most active in summer. Susceptibility is high in children below 14, as a
rule. Outbreaks of viral meningitis occur cyclically.

[Although no etiology of meningitis is mentioned in this report,
enterovirus infection is probably responsible. High morbidity of viral
meningitis in the neighboring Amur Region has also been observed, in which
case one of the routes of infection is considered to be fecal contamination
of the waters of the Amur river. - Mod.NP]
