[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 338 724, with 81 093 cases reported by China. There are now a total of 225 983 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 192 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 30 457 cases when compared with the data on 21 Mar 2020, with the USA accounting for 7434 cases of the newly confirmed cases, Italy accounting for 5560 cases, and Spain for 3272 of newly reported cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside of China now represents 75.7% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe, and the USA is accelerating rapidly as more testing has become available. A global total of 14 687 deaths have been reported, 11 417 outside mainland China.

For the 25th consecutive day, more cases have been reported from outside mainland China than within mainland China. The total number of deaths reported from outside of mainland China is now greater than the total number of deaths reported by mainland China. Mainland China has virtually interrupted local transmission, although imported cases are on the rise. South Korea has slowly decreased daily new case counts hovering in the 100 plus or minus 50 cases. Cases in the USA are escalating very rapidly, and Europe's rise is equally daunting. It would be interesting to see an epidemic curve by date of onset to see what the true curve of transmission is, as I suspect now that more testing is being done, many of those tested have been sick for days while awaiting testing. - Mod.MPP]

And Macau reported 3 additional newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, bringing their total to 21.

Of the 39 newly confirmed cases, all were imported cases into China. Cases were reported by Beijing (10), Shanghai (10), Fujian (6), Guangdong (6), Shandong (2), Gansu (2), and 1 each in Zhejiang, Henan and Chongqing, bringing the total number of imported cases to 353.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 64 cases and 7 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (21-22 Mar 2020), when there were 98 newly confirmed cases. The daily case count continues to oscillate from below to above 100 newly confirmed cases per day, with today's (22 Mar 2020) newly confirmed case lower than yesterday's (21 Mar 2020) and the day before yesterday's as well (20 Mar 2020). Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission, with 71.9% of the total cases reported, followed by Gyeonbuk with 21.9% of the total cases reported. Looking at recent activity, Daegu reported 37.5% of the newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Gyeonggi with 16.3% of the newly confirmed cases.

Similar to what is being seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases coming from Europe (and I would suspect they are beginning to notice a similar trend in people coming from the USA). They are now up to 47 imported cases in quarantine, with the 1st report of patients in quarantine on 16 Mar 2020, when 4 cases in quarantine were reported (COVID-19 update (41): global, surge capacity, vaccine development, WHO 20200316.7096222). As in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. There are obvious concerns regarding initiation of new clusters that might escape into the community.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 59 138 cases, including 5476 deaths, up from 53 578 cases and 4825 deaths reported on 21 Mar 2020. In this 24-hour period, there were 651 newly reported deaths from Italy. The 24-hour change between 21 and 22 Mar 2020 was 5560 newly confirmed cases, compared with 6557 newly confirmed cases between 20 and 21 Mar 2020. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (27 206), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (7555), and Venice (5122), all in the northern part of the country. Those 3 provinces combined account for 54.8% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, compared with 69.7% of the newly confirmed cases in the previous 24 hours. In this 24-hour period, Piedmont reported 12.0% of the newly confirmed cases. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was changed to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. As for seeing an impact, one shouldn't expect to see an impact until at least one incubation period has passed, as there are newly infected individuals who are still in their incubation period for up to 14 days. That being said, up to today 22 Mar 2020, there is no trend for stabilizing or decreasing the daily number of new cases that are confirmed. As mentioned before, the Public Health world is looking at Italy to see whether this is feasible and whether it has an impact in terms of slowing down transmission of the virus.

C. Iran: 21 638 cases, 1685 deaths

https://www.gulftoday.ae/news/2020/03/22/129-new-coronavirus-deaths-in-iran-toll-rises-to-1685


Iran on Sun 22 Mar 2020 announced 129 new deaths caused by the novel coronavirus, raising to 1685 the official death toll in one of the worst-hit countries along with Italy and China. Health ministry spokesman Kianouche Jahanpour said more than 1028 new cases had been recorded in the past 24 hours, and a total of 21 638 people had now tested positive for the virus. "There were 1028 new confirmed infected cases in the past 24 hours ... and 7913 people have recovered," said Kianush Jahanpur.

Iran is the Middle Eastern country most affected by the coronavirus. The Islamic republic is among the 3 countries hardest hit by the virus, with an official death toll behind only Italy and China.

The authorities have asked people to avoid all travel during the Persian New Year holidays, which usually sees almost all citizens take to the roads. But the pleas have been ignored by many.

[In the 24 hours from 21 to 22 Mar 2020, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 20 610 to 21 638, an increase of 1028 newly confirmed cases but 21.9% less than in the previous 24 hours (1237). The number of deaths has also increased from 1556 to 1685, an increase of 129 deaths in the 24-hour period.

As I mentioned for the past few days, the significant translocation of the population for the holidays is of concern as it may lead to continued intra-country/provincial exportations of the virus.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 00:00 CET.

Highlights
----------
- Four new countries/territories/areas from the African Region have reported cases of COVID-19.

- As COVID-19 cases continue to increase, many countries are requesting individuals to stay at home in self-quarantine. WHO EURO has released a guide on how to stay physically active during self-quarantine. Information can be found at http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-technical-guidance/stay-physically-active-during-self-quarantine/_recache#article.

- There has been a rise in criminals disguising themselves as WHO to steal money or sensitive information. WHO urges individuals to stay alert and to verify the authenticity of the request. Information on protecting yourselves against scams as well as reporting the scam to WHO can be found at https://www.who.int/about/communications/cyber-security.

[These data come from Table 1: Countries, territories or areas with reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Data as of 12:00 AM 20 Mar 2020, available at the source URL above.

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 185. This includes 16 countries (including 3 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 59 countries (including 6 territories) from the European region, 9 from the Southeast Asia region, 19 countries (including one territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 44 countries (including 10 territories) from the Americas region, and 38 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The European region continues with rapid transmission, having confirmed 22 752 new cases and 1426 deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, with Italy for 28.8% of newly confirmed cases, Spain for 21.7% of newly confirmed cases, and Germany accounting for 13.8% of newly confirmed cases (bringing the total of these 3 countries accounting for 64.4% of newly confirmed cases in Europe). The Americas region does not include an update from the USA, so it artificially looks as though transmission has slowed down.

Figure 2. The epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [20 Mar 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic in China, juxtaposed with the increasing epidemics outside of China. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA, but other countries are following suit. It would be very nice to see an epidemic curve based on the date of onset of illness. The note on the bottom of this graph cautions: "Note that the apparent decrease in number of cases may be due to a reporting bias during the weekend."

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Hopkins table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
