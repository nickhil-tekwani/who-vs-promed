----------------------------------------------------------------------
In the interests of providing proven efficacious recommendations for reducing tick-transmitted diseases in ProMED posts, it seems prudent to raise some questions regarding the statement that the organic IC3 pest control product has "proven efficacy against target pests, reducing their threat by as much as 92 percent, with no adverse effects on humans, the environment, or non-target insects and wildlife."

It is not listed on the US EPA's insect repellants use and effectiveness web page http://cfpub.epa.gov/oppref/insect/search_results.cfm?Rangetime=&hidSelected=1&ProductName=&Ingredient=null&Company=null&Registration=&Submit=Search# and my web search "IC3 efficacy" revealed only a news story-type item on the University of Rhode Island website from 2013 regarding this product (http://web.uri.edu/celsnews/tick-project/). In addition, depending on its persistence in the environment, its mechanism of action on octopamine receptors could have off-target effects on non-insect invertebrates such as crustaceans http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/content/78/2/237.long. Any peer-reviewed references pertaining to the safety and efficaciousness of the IC3 product would be welcome.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Gurfield for his comments. As he mentioned, peer-reviewed references addressing the safety and efficacy of IC3 would be of interest. Daily inspection to find and remove ticks in areas where Powassan virus transmission occurs remains prudent to avoid infection with this virus. These areas include the Great Lakes and northeastern states and the southern regions of the eastern Canadian provinces. - Mod.TY
