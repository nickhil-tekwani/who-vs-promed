--------------------------------------------------------------
6 types of dog and cat treats marketed by TW Enterprises of Ferndale, WA, USA
and distributed in the USA and Canada under its name and the Aron Pet Food
name were recalled Wed, 7 Jun 2005, after reports of Salmonella Thompson [_S.
enterica_ serotype Thompson - Mod.LL] infection in humans.
5 cases of infection caused by the organism -- 3 in Canada and 2 in the USA --
developed among people who handled the pet treats, TW Enterprises said in a
statement distributed by the FDA [for the FDA press release, see below -
Mod.LL]. Consumers should not feed the treats to their pets but should instead
dispose of them in a safe manner, the company said.

TW Enterprises nationwide recall of pet treats due to Salmonella contamination
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TW Enterprises of Ferndale, Washington today alerted consumers that it is
recalling certain dog and cat treats it markets because they may be
contaminated with Salmonella Thompson [_S. enterica_ serotype Thompson -
Mod.LL]. People handling these treats can become infected with the organism,
especially if they have not thoroughly washed their hands after having contact
with any the treats or any surfaces exposed to these products.
Salmonellosis is an infection that can cause serious infections in small
children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.
Healthy people may only suffer short-term symptoms, such as high fever, severe
headache, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Long-term
complications can include arthritis.
[For the recalled products, see product list above - Mod.LL]
TW Enterprises Inc manufactured these pet treats and distributed them
throughout the USA under its name and the Aron Pet Food name. Aron Pet Food of
Abbotsford, BC, Canada imported raw materials from TW Enterprises into Canada
for use in products that were sold there under the Aron Pet Food label. That
firm is also conducting a recall of these products.
TW Enterprises has informed FDA of its action and is fully cooperating with
the agency. FDA, the Washington State Department of Agriculture and the Public
Health Agency of Canada became aware of the problem after 5 cases (3 in Canada
and 2 in the USA) of the serotype Thompson infection developed among people
who may have handled these pet treats. Follow up analysis indicated that the
illnesses were linked to these pet treats.
The firm, FDA and the other authorities are actively investigating this matter
to determine the source of this problem, and will take any additional steps
necessary to protect the public health.
Consumers who have these pet treats should not feed them to their pets, but
should instead dispose of them in a safe manner (e.g., in a securely covered
trash receptacle). Anyone who is experiencing the symptoms infection after
having handled one of these pet products should seek medical attention, and
report their use of the product and illness to the nearest FDA office.
People should thoroughly wash their hands after handling any pet treat --
especially those made from raw animal protein such as meat or fish -- to help
prevent infection. People may risk bacterial infection not only by handling
the treats, but also by contact with pets or surfaces exposed to these treats,
so it is important that they thoroughly wash their hands with hot water and
soap. Since elderly people, young children, and people with weakened immune
systems are particularly at risk from exposure they should avoid handling
these products.

[_S. enterica_ serotype Thompson, when associated with an animal source,
appears to be primarily associated with beef. An example is the report of an
outbreak of 52 infections with this organism associated with improperly
handled roast beef, published in 1999 (1). Contaminated produce may also be a
vehicle for human acquisition, as noted in the posting below linked to
lettuce, as well as 76 cases associated with fresh cilantro (2).
In 2001, the irradiation of pet food (including pet treats) was approved for
use in the USA. The posts do not state whether these products were
irradiated. Likewise, since the products were salmon-, shrimp-, or beef-
based, the mechanism of contamination is not yet clear. - Mod.LL]
[It is interesting that there are no reports of dogs or cats suffering from
the infection. - Mod.JW]
