Only 50 percent of pomegranates suitable for export
---------------------------------------------------
On the European markets, pomegranates from India are very expensive
at the moment. The prices are much higher than last year [2007],
because there is a shortage on the market. It is suggested that lots
of pomegranates are infected with an unknown disease and that because
of this only 50 percent of the total pomegranate production in India
is suitable for export.

There are fewer pomegranates coming to Europe, and not all
pomegranates exported to Europe are allowed on the European market,
because they don't match the European standards about pesticides. The
increasing knowledge of the consumer about the health benefits of
pomegranates has caused a serious increase in the demand for
pomegranates and because of this the prices are skyrocketing.

[A loss of at least 60 percent of the pomegranate crop due to oily
spot disease has been reported recently from the Indian state of
Maharashtra (see ProMED-mail 20071123.3789). This may in fact be the
disease referred to in the news item above, since around three
quarters of the Indian pomegranate crop is grown in Maharashtra.

Oily spot is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_
pathovar _punicae_. The main damage is observed on fruits, which
develop black spots and usually split resulting in enormous yield
losses. The pathogen is spread by infected plant material (including
cuttings), mechanical means and wind-splashed rain. Heavy rains are
thought to have been a triggering factor for the current epidemic in
India. No commercial pomegranate cultivar has been found to show any
resistance to oily spot. Disease management includes use of clean
planting material, phytosanitary measures, and bactericidal sprays
containing antibiotics or copper. Use of such sprays may be the
reason why some of the exported pomegranates are being rejected in Europe.
