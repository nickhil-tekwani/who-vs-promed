33 people were hospitalized in a hepatitis outbreak in the Vologda region of
Russia, half of them children. This outbreak of acute viral hepatitis occurred
in the village of Sheksna.
"82 cases have been reported in Sheksna and neighboring settlements since the
beginning of 2005, a record high in the past 15 years," Ivan Sudakov, Chief
Physician at the District Hospital, told Itar-Tass on Friday [2 Sep 2005].
There are 14 children among the people who are being treated for hepatitis at
present. They are pupils at a children's home who were spending the vacation
at a health center. They were rushed to hospital just before the beginning of
the new school year in Russia on 1 Sep 2005. Hepatitis cases were reported in
a Sheksna kindergarten and among the local gypsy population. Experts blamed
the poor quality of drinking water for the outbreak of the infection.
Medical authorities have checked 700 people since the outbreak of the disease,
including 400 children under 14 years of age. 370 people have been
vaccinated. The regional health care department has allocated 100 000 roubles
from a reserve fund because of the high cost of the vaccine. "The situation is
fully under control," Sudakov said.

[Although not stated in the text, it can be assumed from the waterborne mode
of infection, the age distribution of the patients, and the availability of
preventative vaccine that this outbreak is caused by hepatitis A virus.
Confirmation of the diagnosis would be appreciated, together with an
assessment of the reason for the decline in drinking water quality.
Vologda is a city located in northwestern Russia and is the capital of the
Vologda Oblast. Vologda is situated on the Vologda River about 400 km
northeast of Moscow and about 480 km east of Saint Petersburg. A map of the
