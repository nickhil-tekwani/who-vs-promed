At least 10 people have died in an outbreak of monkeypox in western Central African Republic, a country already hit by cholera, the health ministry announced Wednesday [28 Sep 2016].

"We have logged 10 deaths out of 19 patients," in the southern province of Basse-Kotto, said Dr Joachim Tenguere of the public health emergencies operations centre. Further deaths have been reported from other villages in Haute-Kotto, the country's largest province.

Preparations are being made for a rapid intervention team to be sent to the area to help those affected cope with the monkeypox outbreak, Tenguere added.

The 1st symptoms of monkeypox are aches, pains and a fever. A bumpy localised rash then appears on any part of the skin. This lesion gradually falls off. [See http://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/symptoms.html for photographs of human cases. - Mod.TY]

The highly contagious disease usually strikes in remote rural areas surrounded by rainforests although the chances of catching it are very slim, according to experts.

As well as monkeys, African squirrels are among the main carriers of this lethal virus, which was 1st discovered by scientists in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970.

Some fatal cases of the disease were detected in neighbouring DR Congo several months ago.

[Apparently, the current monkeypox outbreak is not limited to the Basse-Kotto prefecture, but cases are occurring in the Haute-Kotto prefecture as well, although a case number is not given. The number of cases in Basse-Kotto prefecture is increasing. There were 14 cases with one fatality reported on 23 Sep 2016, and just 5 days later, on 28 Sep 2016, there are 19 cases and at least 10 deaths reported above. That appears to be an unusual high number of deaths. The USA CDC states that the case fatality rate is around 10 percent (http://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/symptoms.html), suggesting that there is significant underreporting of total cases.

Monkeypox cases are reported sporadically in the Central African Republic (CAR). This is the 2nd reported outbreak this year (2016). There have been human cases of monkeypox virus infection reported previously in the CAR. As noted in the comment in the previous ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20160119.3947756), Dr Mirdad Kazanji, director of the Institut Pasteur at Bangui, reported that in June 2010, 2 boys aged 14 and 15 years were found to have diffuse maculopapular lesions associated with pustules and crusts (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20111129.3488). Dr Kazanji indicated that the phylogenetic tree showed that the 2010 virus strain was identical to the Democratic Republic of the Congo strain circulating in central Africa. This reported strain was identical to one associated with an outbreak of monkeypox in 2001 in a Bantu family living on the border between the CAR and the DRC, 480 km (about 300 miles) from the 2010 cases.

It would be of interest to know to which clade the current monkeypox virus belongs, and which wild animals are the reservoirs in the Central African Republic. Given the human fatalities, one would assume that the monkeypox virus responsible in the current outbreak is the Central African one that occurs in the DR Congo.

The virus is seldom transmitted directly from one person to another, but there is a documented instance in the Republic of the Congo. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Although not determined, the main reservoirs of monkeypox are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ sp; an arboreal rodent), and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_.
