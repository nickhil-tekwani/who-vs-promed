Government health officials say 4 deaths have been linked to
bacteria-contaminated turkey products that were recalled this week.
Minnesota-based Cargill Inc. announced this week that it is recalling 16.7
million pounds of its cooked products, including sliced turkey breast,
Cajun-fried turkey and smoked turkey, because of [contamination with
_Listeria monocytogenes_ bacteria.
Sonja Olsen, a epidemiologist with the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, said Friday there have been 28 cases of listeriosis involving
Cargill products since July. She said the outbreak has caused 4 deaths as
well as three miscarriages or stillbirths.
