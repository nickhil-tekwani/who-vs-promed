A 27-year-old French woman suffered a severe earlobe infection with
cowpox virus, a relative of the smallpox virus, as a result of contact
with infected pet rats, according to an "in press" report published
online by the Journal of Infection. [Case report: Severe Ear
Chondritis due to Cowpox Virus Transmitted by a Pet Rat. By Antoine
Elsendoorna et al., Journal of Infection online, 24 Jun 2011
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445311003902].


The woman bought 2 pet rats, imported from the Czech Republic, which
quickly got sick and died. A few days after the rats died, she sought
care for an inflammatory lesion on her left earlobe. The woman was
treated unsuccessfully with antibiotics, and the lesion spread to the
skin of her neck and cheek. Eventually, she was hospitalized and
underwent surgery to excise extensive necrotic tissue at the site of
the original lesion and smaller ones on one finger and her abdomen.
The doctors sent specimens to the French Armed Forces Biomedical
Research Institute, which, after a series of tests, identified the
pathogen as cowpox virus. It was later learned that other pet rats
from the same store had also fallen ill and died.

The report says that wild rodents, not cows, are now considered the
true reservoir for cowpox virus, and that in recent years, several
human cowpox infections have resulted from contact with pet rats,
though humans are more commonly infected through contact with cats,
which are incidental hosts. The authors say the cessation of smallpox
vaccination may partly explain the reemergence of cowpox in humans, as
the vaccine probably induced some immunity to other orthopoxviruses.

[As previously commented, cowpox virus is a misnomer. Cowpox virus is
not normally present in cows. The natural hosts are probably rodents,
but it has been isolated from a variety of animals, including domestic
and wild felines and canines, elephants and humans. Human infections
have usually been traced to handling of cowpox-infected animals. Human
cowpox is a rare zoonotic infection, evoking a self-limiting disease,
except in the case of immunocompromised and eczematous patients
(particularly children), where it can become severe, as recounted in
the above report.

Cowpox virus is distributed widely in Europe, western parts of the
former Soviet Union, and adjacent areas of Northern and Central Asia,
with an increasing number of reports originating from Europe. Genome
sequence analyses have revealed considerable diversity among isolates
of cowpox virus. There is a considerable literature on cowpox virus
and human infection that can be accessed via the ProMED-mail archived
material listed below. - Mod.CP]
