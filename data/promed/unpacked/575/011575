Bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Austria
-------------------------------------------
(Date of previous outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Austria
reported to the OIE: 2001).
Information received on (and dated) 22 Jun 2005 from Prof Dr Ulrich Herzog,
chief veterinary officer, Federal Ministry for Health and Women, Vienna.

Reason for immediate notification: re-occurrence of a listed disease or
infection in a country or zone/compartment following a report declaring the
outbreak(s) ended.

Date of first confirmation of the event: 15 Jun 2005.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Details of outbreak:
First administrative division: Vorarlberg federal province
Lower administrative division: Bregenz district
Type of epidemiological unit: farm
Name of the location: Riezlern
Species: bov

Number of animals in the outbreak:
susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
8 / 1 / 1 / 7 / 0

Description of affected population: small farm with 8 cattle and 2 pigs.
The farm is not a member of a breeding association; there was never any
purchase of animals. No live animals have ever been sold; all cattle to be
slaughtered were taken directly to the slaughterhouse.

The affected cow had ear tag number AT 138 752 583. It was born on 31 Mar
1994 at the farm and was found dead on 26 May 2005.

The most recently born offspring of the affected cow (calf AT 583 539 672,
born on 24 Jan 2005) was slaughtered on 26 Apr 2005. 2 offspring of the
affected cow were still on the farm when the farm was quarantined (cow AT
777 654 242, born in 2002, and female calf AT 079 944 747, born in 2003, on
pasture).

Feed: concentrated feed, whole meal, beet. Since 2002, controls of feeding
stuff providers are carried out every year in spring on the occasion of
farm audits. The feeding ban was met completely. Before 1995, concentrated
feed was imported from Germany.

Diagnosis:
The affected cow was well-fed and delivered about 9 litres of milk per day.
During the period prior to its death it showed movement disorders, with no
improvement after hoof trimming. The head was held in a low position but
there were no disturbances in excretion or behaviour. The owner ascribed
the movement disorders to the age of the cow and did not consult a
veterinarian.

The Austrian Federal Ministry of Health and Women was informed of the
suspicion of BSE by the German Federal Ministry of Consumer Protection,
Food and Agriculture on 17 Jun 2005. The affected cow had been delivered to
a rendering plant in Germany. Samples for BSE testing were taken in
Germany. Due to the fact that the 1st rapid test was positive, the sample
was sent to the German National Reference Laboratory in the isle of Riems
on 16 Jun 2005.

Laboratories where diagnosis was made: Bavarian Department for Health and
Food Safety (Bayerisches Landesamt fuer Gesundheit und
Lebensmittelsicherheit, Dienststelle Oberschleissheim), Oberschleissheim,
Germany
Diagnostic tests used: rapid test
Date: 15 Jun 2005
Results : positive (twice)
Laboratories where diagnosis was made: Friedrich-Loeffler Institute, Riems,
Germany
Diagnostic tests used: immunohistochemistry
Date: 21 Jun 2005
Results: positive
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.

Control measures:
- immediate quarantine based on suspicion; the animals were brought back
from pasture.
- culling of all cattle on the farm, sampling.

Other details/comments: a previous BSE case in Austria was detected in
December 2001 in Lower Austria federal province (see Disease Information
2001; 14(50): 289, 14 Dec, and Disease Information 2002; 15(10): 28, 8 Mar).
