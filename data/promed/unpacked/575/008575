The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship is responding to 3 probable cases and 1 confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Buena Vista, Lyon, and Osceola counties.

With these new announcements, Iowa now has 49 cases of the disease in the state. The Department has quarantined the premises and once the presence of the disease is confirmed, all birds on the property will be humanely euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease.

- Buena Vista 14: A layer pullet farm that has experienced increased mortality. An estimate on the number of birds at the site is still pending. Initial testing showed it positive for H5 avian influenza. Additional confirmatory testing is pending from the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames.

- Buena Vista 15: Turkey farm that has experienced increased mortality. An estimate on the number of birds at the site is still pending. Initial testing showed it positive for H5 avian influenza. Additional confirmatory testing is pending from the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames.

- Lyon 1: Commercial laying operation that has experienced increased mortality. An estimate on the number of birds at the site is still pending. Initial testing showed it positive for H5 avian influenza. Additional confirmatory testing is pending from the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames.

- Osceola 4: Broiler farm with an estimated 700 birds that has experienced increased mortality. Confirmatory testing by the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames showed the birds positive for H5N2 highly pathogenic avian influenza.

As the Department receives final confirmations of the disease updated information will be posted to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship's website at http://www.iowaagriculture.gov/avianinfluenza.asp

South Dakota
---------
After nearly 3 weeks of South Dakota being free of new cases of the H5N2 strain of avian influenza -- also known as bird flu -- the virus has afflicted 2 locations in the Yankton area.

Dustin Oedekoven, state veterinarian with the South Dakota Animal Industry Board, confirmed to the Press & Dakotan [Tue 12 May 2015] that the virus has now affected the 2 local operations.

"We don't release the names of the farms, but the 2 farms are in Hutchinson and Yankton counties," Oedekoven said.

He said the 2 affected commercial turkey operations announced [Tue 12 May 2015] combine for around 115 000 birds.

Reuters reported as of [Mon 11 May 2015] that a number of states and 2 Canadian provinces had reported instances of avian flu in 1 of 3 strains -- H5N2, H5N8, and H5N1. H5N2 has been, by far, the most prevalent, affecting Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, British Columbia, and Ontario -- leading to the deaths or culling of an estimated 30 million birds.

Oedekoven said the 2 area cases mark the 7th and 8th instances of the virus in South Dakota. "Just under half a million turkeys have been affected by that (in South Dakota alone)," he said. He added that while it's most certainly avian influenza, a confirmation of the N2 strain will come later [Wed 12 May 2015]. "The 2 latest farms we haven't received the final virus type on," he said. "I expect that it will be the H5N2 virus, but what we do know is it's the H5 strain of avian influenza."

Oedekoven said these were the 1st signs of the virus in the state in 3 weeks. "Up until [Sat 9 May 2015] when these 2 latest farms contacted me about increased mortality in the farms, we had not had a case reported in just over 3 weeks," he said. "We were hoping we'd seen the end of it, but unfortunately not."

Oedekoven said each case of avian flu necessitates a grim sequence of events. "In each case, we set up what we call a control zone which is a 10-kilometer -- which is just over 6 miles -- radius around the farm and we sample all the poultry within that zone to determine if the virus has spread outside of that zone." He said that in the previous 6 cases, the virus was not found within the control zone off the initial infection site. Tests near the farms in Yankton and Hutchinson counties are ongoing. From there, Oedekoven said, there's little choice but to euthanize entire flocks on the afflicted farms.

"There is a fairly intense response whenever an infected farm is found," he said. "We work quickly to depopulate or destroy those birds." He added that the euthanization is necessary in order to prevent the spread and also out of respect for the birds themselves. "The infected birds become virus factories," he said. "They make a lot of virus, and they shed it and we're trying to prevent this virus from becoming more widespread, so we destroy those birds in an effort to limit the spread of the virus. Also, (we do it) for humane purposes because this virus does cause very high morbidity and mortality." The primary method for euthanasia is to use Class A firefighting foam to asphyxiate the birds.

The afflicted farms in Yankton and Hutchinson counties are set to have their turkey populations depopulated today [12 May 2015] with disposal of the birds should be completed by the end of the week. The state's veterinary office, USDA and the farms will be responsible for depopulation and disposal.

The H5N2 strain of avian influenza was first discovered in December [2014] and its methods of transmission are still not fully known. However, Oedekoven said humans are speculated to have a hand in its spread on commercial poultry operations. "There are several different ways the virus could spread," he said. "We don't have great information on exactly how that's occurring, but some ways it could occur are through contamination by people who are entering the barn to do chores, mechanical repairs, and just daily activities within a poultry barn."

He added that small birds such as infected sparrows and starlings can also contaminate barn food, and water and airborne contamination are also speculated to contribute.

Oedekoven said there are a number of measures farmers can take to reduce the risks to their flocks. "Increased biosecurity ... is the main way we prevent the virus from getting into the barns," he said. "(This includes) wearing boots that can be cleaned and disinfected prior to going into the barns, appropriate protective clothing, being cautious about who's entering the barn and that they haven't been around poultry or other wildlife."

He added there's also a number of warning signs for farmers to be aware of, and to contact the state vet's office should they become suspicious. "The signs are rapid death loss in a number of poultry," he said. "They can also exhibit some neurological symptoms and respiratory symptoms before they die, but typically, they will have a large number of them die at once. We strongly encourage anyone who notices those signs to call our office right away and report those signs." Oedekoven said the state has researched a number of reported concerns that did not turn out to be avian influenza.

Nebraska
--------
[Tue 12 May 2015] also saw another state join the list of those dealing with H5N2. A press release from the Nebraska Department of Agriculture (NDA) confirmed that a commercial chicken operation of 1.7 million birds in Dixon County had reported the virus.

"Unfortunately, Nebraska has joined a long list of states currently dealing with highly pathogenic avian influenza," NDA Greg Ibach said in the release. "The goal is to quarantine the flock and attempt to control and contain the virus as quickly as possible."

The 1st 6 cases in South Dakota were all linked to the Hutterite processing plant Cooperative. One has to wonder if these cases are somehow tied to those earlier cases or to the processing plant itself.

Only time will tell. - Mod.TG]
