A young 18-month-old munsterlander was killed by the Aujeszky's disease virus after a hunt in Moselle. The virus, most often fatal, is transmitted from wild boars to domestic carnivores. A vaccination exists for breeding pigs, not for the wild boar. Hunting dogs are therefore particularly vulnerable to Aujeszky's disease, a herpesvirus that is almost always deadly.

"We hunted on [Sat 9 Feb 2019] and [Sun 10 Feb 2019] at Troisfontaines, then the next day at Zimming. [Thu 14 Feb 2019], around 9 pm, the dog began to scratch the mouth, until it bled blood, then the dog became paralysed. The next day at 6 am she was dead."

In mid-December, when the 1st symptoms of the strange disease that suddenly hit his 18-month-old munsterlander, Romaric immediately feared a fatal outcome. The phenomenon has a name: Aujesky's disease, otherwise called pseudo-rabies as the clinical signs evoke classic rabies. Without being able to be positive about the exact place and time of the infection, the tracker had evoked a chase action in the course of which his dog had caught up with a wounded little boar; the kind of contact that may be enough.

After the Meuse in recent years, the Meurthe-et-Moselle near Toul and Bayon last year [2018], this is a proven case in Moselle. The holiday season, then a staff problem within the laboratory empowered to lead the biological investigation explain why the news only falls now. The case of another dog, euthanized but showing the same symptoms in the area of Folschviller, is still being analyzed.

Aujeszky, named after his Hungarian discoverer in 1902, is a highly contagious fatal viral disease (herpesvirus). It is accidentally transmitted from suids to domestic carnivores (dogs, cats), which constitute dead ends of health. Of note, Aujeszky is not transmissible to humans; nothing to fear on this side. But hunting dogs are particularly exposed.

The resulting recommendation is common sense: in the absence of treatment, the hunter must prevent as much as possible his 4-legged auxiliaries from biting into an injured or dead wild boar, and especially never let them ingest offal. Easier said than done. While African swine fever knocks at the door at the Belgian border this confirmed case of pseudo-rabies is the type of news which Lorraine hunters would gladly have passed.

[Aujeszky's disease (AD), also known as pseudorabies and Mad Itch , is included in OIE's list of reportable diseases (multi-species group).

It is caused by an alphaherpesvirus that infects the central nervous system and other organs, such as the respiratory tract, of various mammals (such as dogs, cats, cattle, sheep, rabbits, foxes, minks) except humans and the tailless apes. It is associated primarily with pigs, the natural hosts, which remain latently infected following clinical recovery (except piglets under 2 weeks old, which die from encephalitis). As a consequence, the pig is the only species able to survive a productive infection and therefore, serves as the reservoir host. In pigs, the severity of clinical signs depends on the age of the pig, the route of infection, the virulence of the infecting strain, and the immunological status of the animal. Young piglets are highly susceptible with mortality rates reaching 100% during the 1st 2 weeks of age. When pigs are older than 2 months (grower-finisher pigs), the respiratory forms become predominant with hyperthermia, anorexia, and mild to severe respiratory signs.

In other species, AD is less common. In cattle and sheep, it is almost always fatal within a few days, clinically resembling scrapie: the 1st symptom is intense pruritus concentrated in a patch of skin, usually manifested as severe licking, rubbing, or gnawing. Affected animals become progressively weaker, and eventually recumbent. Convulsions, bellowing, teeth grinding, cardiac irregularities, and rapid, shallow breathing are common. The clinical signs are similar in dogs and cats, and a combination of neurologic signs, pharyngeal paralysis, and profuse salivation may resemble rabies. Affected animals typically die within 1 to 2 days.

A diagnosis of Aujeszky's disease is established by detecting the agent (virus isolation, polymerase chain reaction [PCR]), as well as by detecting a serological response in the live animal.

Aujeszky's disease is endemic in many parts of the world, but several countries, such as the USA, Canada, New Zealand, and many member states of the European Union, have successfully completed eradication programmes.

The above and additional information on AD is available in OIE's relevant manual chapter, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.02_AUJESZKYS_DIS.pdf and in http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/aujeszkys_disease.pdf.

Moselle is a department in north-east France, named after the river Moselle, a tributary of the Rhine, which flows through the western part of the department. Map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moselle_(department)#/media/File:Moselle-Position.svg. - Mod.AS
