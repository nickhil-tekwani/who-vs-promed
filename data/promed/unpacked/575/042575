#Ebola: 3 more cases today & 4 deaths (1 in the community) bring the outbreak totals to 542 confirmed & probable cases & 319 deaths. This outbreak is staggeringly large in context where nearly 50 000 doses of vaccine have been administered.

2. Speaking of the #Ebola vaccine, it's really nice to see that its use in the North Kivu outbreak made @voxdotcom's list of top science stories of the year. Some great scientists working at Canada's National Lab made that vaccine.

An ongoing Ebola outbreak in a war-torn region of the Democratic Republic of Congo is already the 2nd-largest Ebola outbreak in history, with more than 500 cases. But amid the tragedy and chaos, public health officials have accomplished a remarkable feat: For the 1st time in history, an experimental Ebola vaccine is being rolled out at a large scale, potentially preventing infections and saving lives.

Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV is the 1st highly effective Ebola vaccine. But because of a lack of pharmaceutical company interest, it literally sat on a shelf until it was licensed to Merck in 2014.

It wasn't until this year [2018] that the vaccine was used in an ongoing outbreak. Public health officials have managed to get more than 45 000 people vaccinated as of this writing. And as Peter Salama, the head of the new Health Emergencies Program at the World Health Organization, told Vox, health officials are achieving between 95 and 100 per cent coverage. Those are the levels we see for vaccination coverage of well-tested shots in stable and wealthy countries. So, this Ebola vaccine rollout in a war zone is something to celebrate.]

[The vaccine was created by scientists at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, which is part of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). PHAC licensed it to NewLink Genetics, which started developing the vaccine; NewLink in turn licensed it to Merck in 2014. - Mod.LK]

News of the response
Youth and sport
---------------
- The last phases of the football [soccer] tournament 'Ebola Pas Chez Moi' [Ebola not in my house] started this Mon 17 Dec 2018 with the final and the 3rd place playoff in Butembo. After 2 weeks of strong emotions, it was the 'Racing Club of Kivu' (RCK) team that won the title of tournament champion in Butembo after having imposed on penalties against the team 'Jeunesse Sportive de Butembo '(JSB). The RCK will face Beni's championship team in the Grand Final of the tournament and attempt to win the Cup of Hope this Thu 20 Dec 2018.
- The coordination of the Ebola response organized this football tournament in Beni and Butembo in order to build trust with the youth of both cities. It was observed that young people were often the source of reluctance in the community and the 1st perpetrators of destruction of sanitary materials. The aim of the football tournament was to appease this youth, raise awareness about Ebola and invite them to take ownership of the Ebola response to end the epidemic.
- Throughout the tournament, many awareness activities were organized. Community animators animated the games with messages and awareness songs. After being trained on the disease and the means of prevention, the young players themselves became involved in raising public awareness by recording prevention messages that were also broadcast by local radio stations. A special prize was awarded to the player of the tournament voted best sensitizer of the competition. Handwashing and temperature sensing devices were installed at the entrance to all stadiums. Moreover, on the sidelines of the final in Butembo, experts on the different pillars of the Ebola response were set up in booths and answered all the public's questions about the epidemic.

Vaccination
-----------
- Continued wide-belt vaccination (or ring plus) in Otomaber (in Komanda Health Zone) and Aloya (in Mabalako Health Zone).
- Continued immunization of primary care providers in the Goma health zone.
- Since vaccination began on 8 August 2018, 48 048 people have been vaccinated, including 19 017 in Beni [North Kivu], 8619 in Katwa [North Kivu], 5077 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 4974 in Butembo [North Kivu], 2208 in Kalunguta [North Kivu], 1663 in Mandima [Ituri], 824 in Komanda [Ituri], 791 in Vuhovi [North Kivu], 750 in Masereka [North Kivu], 700 in Lubero [North Kivu], 670 in Oicha [North Kivu], 607 in Kyondo [North Kivu], 599 in Mutwanga [North Kivu], 434 in Bunia [Ituri], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 344 in Musienene [North Kivu], 257 in Goma [North Kivu], 70 in Biena [North Kivu], 63 in Alimbongo [North Kivu], 13 in Karisimbi [North Kivu], and 13 in Kisangani [Tshopo].

[2] Summary: Ebola hits 539 cases as outreach efforts extend in Beni
Date: Mon 17 Dec 2018.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) ministry of health today [17 Dec 2018] and over the weekend confirmed 18 new Ebola cases, including 9 deaths, in the ongoing outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the north west.

The new cases bring the outbreak total to 539, of which 491 are confirmed and 48 probable. Officials have recorded 315 deaths since the outbreak began in August [2018], and 75 cases are still under investigation.

In the past 3 days, new cases were recorded in Mabalako (4), Butembo (4), Katwa (5), Komanda (3) [Ituri], and 1 each in Oicha and Kalunguta. On 15 Dec 2018, 4 of the 5 deaths recorded were classified as community deaths, which means they took place outside a healthcare or treatment center setting, and thus increase the risk of community transmission.

Vaccination efforts continue
----------------------------
Today [17 Dec 2018] the ministry of health said that vaccination efforts were still ongoing, and primary care providers in Goma, North Kivu's capital and largest city, were being vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine.

Since late August [2018], 48 048 people have been vaccinated in the DRC, including 19 017 in Beni, 8619 in Katwa, 5077 in Mabalako, and 4974 in Butembo [North Kivu].

Community outreach
------------------
Bishop Sikuli Paluku, the bishop of the Butembo-Beni diocese, launched the "Family Without Ebola" campaign throughout the district of Butembo-Beni, the ministry of health said on [15 Dec 2018]. Asking for youth engagement, the bishop said Catholics must act to protect themselves, their families, and neighbors from Ebola. The bishop also referred to community resistance to health workers "inhuman and cruel mischief", and warned against exhuming the graves of Ebola patients.

Today [17 Dec 2018] was also the final game in a football (soccer) tournament held in Beni, called "Ebola Pas Chez Moi" (Ebola not in my house). The activity was meant to educate local youth on the risk of Ebola transmission and the importance of cooperation with response workers. "The coordination of the Ebola response organized this football tournament in Beni and Butembo in order to build trust with the youth of both cities," the ministry of health said.

"It was observed that young people were often the source of reluctance in the community and the 1st perpetrators of destruction of sanitary materials. The aim of the football tournament was to appease this youth, raise awareness about Ebola, and invite them to take ownership of the Ebola response to end the epidemic."

[The Lancet Global Health, abridged, edited]

ref: Kevany S, Yumkella F, Kpakra RS, Jones YM. Presidential responses to Ebola in Sierra Leone. Lancet Glob Health. 2019; 7(1): e24-e25. doi: 10.1016/S2214-109X(18)30421-2.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In Sierra Leone, the 2014 Ebola crisis and the international response placed impossible demands on the local health system.

The capacity of a war-torn infrastructure to manage a large-scale international outbreak of an infectious disease reflected a disconnect between supply and demand of health services of momentous proportions. The funds that flowed in at an unprecedented rate, prompted both by donors' altruism and enlightened interest in health, therefore, were as much a relief as they were a burden. Similarly, capacity to use funds was disproportionately low in a health system in need of long-term rebuilding from the ground up -- sometimes literally so.

Thus, the combination of a post-conflict environment and the urgency of the response made development of innovative investment systems essential. Never has the concept of a sector-wide approach been so relevant or important: a pan-sectoral effort to address Ebola disease through a harmonious mix of enhanced political will, local ownership, accountability, monitoring and evaluation, and donor relations.

In retrospect, one effort stands out as both successful and avant-garde. Under the Government of Sierra Leone's National Ebola Recovery Strategy for Sierra Leone 2015-2017, both the President's Early Recovery initiative and the follow-up President's Recovery Priorities initiative adapted elements of the structure of other emergency response models (such as, the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit in the UK and the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief [PEPFAR]) to the setting of Sierra Leone. Acutely cognisant of the limitations of the health system, this national strategy created a similar post-epidemic supportive hierarchy to that in the UK and US initiatives which (1) spanned all government departments, (2) enhanced monitoring and evaluation of national development efforts, and (3) had unprecedented authority to direct national and international resources to the epidemic.

Public health emergencies in conflict or post-conflict environments make it necessary to consider not just lateral responses but counter-intuitive ones as well. For the President's Recovery Priorities intervention, the principle of a holistic response -- considering not just Ebola but also broader infrastructural, social, economic, and even political contexts -- has been one of the most valuable innovations. As a result of the related augmentation of local leadership, the President's Recovery Priorities demonstrated that cohesive and coordinated efforts that include non-intuitive stakeholders enhance the response. That domestic actors in a resource-limited and traumatised country led the development of this paradigm is testament to the value and insights of local knowledge and ownership.

Heartbreaking images show masked aid workers carrying coffins of babies who died of Ebola as death toll in the Democratic Republic of Congo jumps to 313.

ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall

[This outbreak has been particularly hard on babies and healthcare workers. The toll of any disease is not easy to accept, but the Ebola outbreaks are particularly heartbreaking. According to this report, children are believed to make up about a third of all cases of people being infected, with experts warning they catch it from parents and medical centres. 53 healthcare workers have contracted Ebola, 18 of whom have died. Both losses are large. - Mod.LK]

[4] Tragedy
Date: Tue 18 Dec 2018

https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/wfp-driver-killed-democratic-republic-congo


The World Food Programme [WFP] is deeply saddened by the killing on Mon [17 Dec 2018] of a staff member in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). A driver was shot dead during an ambush by unknown assailants about 70 kilometres [43.5 mi] north west of Goma, North Kivu province, while travelling by road with 3 colleagues to monitor a food distribution. His WFP companions were unhurt in the attack, which occurred at 8.30 am local time in the Loashi area of Masisi territory. Their vehicle was headed for Nyabiondo, where the distribution, to 13 000 people recently displaced by violence, was to take place.

Armed groups, many of them criminal gangs who prey on local communities and travellers, are active in North Kivu, particularly Masisi territory. They are also known to disrupt the work of humanitarian organisations.

"As we mourn our dear friend, we condemn this senseless killing and urge all parties to ensure safe passage for humanitarian staff engaged in life-saving work", said WFP DRC country director Claude Jibidar, who had known the deceased for almost 20 years. [The deceased] leaves behind a wife and 9 children, aged between 3 and 23. He joined WFP in 1995 and was admired and respected by colleagues for his professionalism, decency, and calm. "I never, ever heard him complain", said Makena Walker, the head of WFP's office in Goma, North Kivu's capital, where he was based.

DRC is one of the world's most complex, challenging, and dangerous humanitarian environments. As is the case in such places, humanitarian, and other workers operating there often put their lives on the line, travelling long distances through areas where insecurity is rife. They do so with little thought for their own safety, in the service of those less fortunate than themselves. [The deceased] was one such person, who chose to serve his fellow countrymen with selflessness and dedication. He is fondly remembered by his family, his friends and his colleagues.

The United Nations World Food Programme -- saving lives in emergencies and changing lives for millions through sustainable development. WFP works in more than 80 countries around the world, feeding people caught in conflict and disasters, and laying the foundations for a better future.

[This is truly a tragedy on several fronts, including the loss of a dedicated individual conducting a humanitarian mission, the loss of a father to 9 children and a husband to his wife. The group that targeted the WFP truck is known to specifically "disrupt the work of humanitarian organisations." This is about as despicable an act as anything could be. - Mod.LK
