Update on CCHF in Southern Russia (Stavropol & Dagestan)
---------------------------------------------------------
According to the data for Wed 2 May 2001, 4 cases of Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been recorded in the Russian Federation: in
the Stavropol area (one patient died), and 3 cases in the Republic of
Dagestan. On the basis of provisional diagnosis (tick bites and clinical
data) 11 people have been hospitalized: 6 people in the Stavropol area and
5 in Dagestan (3 being children younger than 14 years of age).
Prophylactic measures against CCHF and another natural foci infections were
considered at the Stavropol Government meeting on 2 Apr 2001 and at the
Sanitary Commission meeting of the Dagestan Government on 24 Apr 2001.
Public health administration services and centers of sanitary and
epidemiological surveillance are undertaking prophylactic measures for
epidemic prevention, epizootic investigation of natural foci, rodent
control, and tick disinfestation. A media campaign has been initiated to
alert the population. These measures are being undertaken in collaboration
with the State Veterinary Service.
The Department of the State Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance of
Russia has published recommendations "Organization and carrying out of
measures against CCHF in the territory of natural foci in Russia," and also
distributed an information letter "Epidemic surveillance of CCHF" to
officials in the south federal region.
