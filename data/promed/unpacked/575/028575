There has been a sudden spurt in malaria cases detected at the Candolim primary health centre (PHC) in the last 2 weeks.

While 26 cases were detected in the 6 months till June 2012, the intense monsoon spell of the last 2-3 weeks saw 50 new cases of malaria being detected, according to medical officer in-charge Dr Sachin Govekar. "There has been a large influx of migrant labour in the last couple of weeks," he said. "I was a little worried in the last 15 days because of the large number of malaria cases. So we doubled our efforts, and I also requisitioned the services of a malaria inspector to bring the situation under control," he said.

He said staff from the Candolim PHC have been visiting areas from where the malaria cases have been reported to check all residents living in those localities. The blood samples are collected on slides and examined the same day at the laboratory at the PHC. If any more malaria cases are detected, then treatment is given on the same day by evening. Apart from this, they have also started fogging in some areas, besides taking other preventive measures. The cases have been reported from different areas of Candolim, Calangute and other neighbouring villages.

"After 2 weeks, we should not be having any problem," Govekar said. "Last year [2011], we had a total of 228 cases. This year [2012], I don't think there will be more than 150 cases." There have, however, not been any cases of filaria, chikungunya, dengue or Japanese encephalitis. The Candolim PHC had only recently held a workshop on vector-borne diseases to create awareness amongst villagers at the Calangute panchayat hall.

At the workshop, Govekar had cautioned that malaria is usually brought into the area by newly-arriving migrant labourers. Monsoon time is the peak season for malaria, he added.

As the city welcomes the monsoon, it's not all reason to rejoice. Accompanying the rain each year are dengue, malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases.

This year [2012], there have been 5 confirmed cases of dengue and 86 cases of malaria, which is almost double the number of cases reported last year [2011] till 9 Jul 2011.

Municipal authorities held a meeting on Monday [9 Jul 2012] to discuss the ways to check the breeding of mosquitoes and intensify awareness programs. "One patient from Civil Lines, North Delhi was confirmed positive for dengue last week. Before this, we had a patient from Shahdara who was diagnosed with the mosquito-borne disease. The total number of dengue cases reported till date is 5," said Dr N K Yadav, municipal health officer. He said that meetings are being held regularly to take stock of the medicines and manpower needed to fight the disease.

"This year [2012], malaria cases have gone up to 86 as against 40 cases reported last year [2011] till this time of the year. No new chikungunya case has been reported though. Five cases of chikungunya were reported between January and February [2012]," Yadav added.

He said that with the arrival of the monsoon season, breeding of mosquitoes in stagnant water and in household items like coolers, flower vases, and unclean overhead tanks is common. A survey by the National Vector-Borne Diseases Control Program in the capital recently found mosquitoes breeding at more than 12 000 offices and households.

Malaria cases are on the rise within NMC limits, though rural areas in the district have fared better in the 1st 6 months of the year [2012], according to the Nashik district malaria office, which has asked NMC officials to be cautious and carry out spraying to contain the chances of an outbreak. "Last year [2011], the number of malaria infection cases from January to June 2011 in the district were 1437, as against 901 cases this year [2012]. At the same time, Nashik city had reported 74 cases last year [2011] as against 100 cases this year [2012] from January 2012. The rise is too steep and a cause of concern. We have suggested several measures to the NMC as per the guidelines," district malaria officer Dr A S Bendre said.

Nashik is densely populated and hence the cleanliness issue becomes critical. Though it has not rained, the number of cases reported is a major cause of concern. The official, however, has strictly advised against fogging, as it is a short-lived measure. "Technically, the effect of fogging is effective only for 3 minutes indoors and is never recommended outdoors, as mosquitoes get a chance to move in the neighbourhood," Bendre said, suggesting residual spraying of places identified as high-risk areas.

The district has witnessed 5 cases of dengue so far (as against 10 last year [2011]). There have been no cases or outbreaks of chikungunya so far this year [2012] as against 37 patients and 9 outbreaks last year [2011]. The district last year witnessed 3652 cases of malaria, and 5 patients succumbed to it as against one death this year so far.

It has only been about a fortnight since the onset of monsoon, and 30 malaria cases have already been reported in Hyderabad.

District health officials who have recently woken up to the fact that the number of malaria cases are comparatively more than those reported last year [2011] are now busy planning ways and means to tackle the malaria menace in the state capital.

Officials said that cases are being reported from areas along river beds and small lakes. Puranapul, Kurmaguda, Ziyaguda, Uppuguda, Amberpet, Saidabad, Bholakpur, Indira Park, Sanathnagar, Banjara Hills and Jubilee Hills are some of the areas from where cases have been reported.

These are also the high risk areas in the city. However, all the cases are of _Plasmodiam vivax_ malaria which is less intense and can be medically managed, officials said.

"The city has grown leaps and bounds in the last few years, and we plan to map the high risk areas for active surveillance once again," said an official.

While corporate hospitals are registering sporadic cases of malaria (one or 2 a week), Fever Hospital superintendent Dr Shankar said that the hospital is getting one to 2 cases on a daily basis. Choked drains, potholed roads and stagnant water in the city are the breeding grounds for mosquitoes that cause the spread of the vector-borne disease.

While GHMC officials claim that fogging and anti-larval operations are being undertaken wherever required to curb the mosquito menace, year after year, there seems to be no respite for residents.

Controlling the vector born disease in the city is a challenging task for the authorities this year [2012]. Sources said that of the total 84 posts of health assistants, a significant 40 posts are lying vacant in the District Health and Medical Office, Hyderabad. The scene is worse when it comes to lab technicians who confirm the tests for the notifiable disease. Of the 14 posts of lab technicians, just 5 are filled.

Each health assistant is responsible for visiting 50 houses on a daily basis to figure out whether there are any fever cases. If the case is confirmed as malaria, radical treatment is provided to the patient. Due to the acute shortage of staff, the focus now is only on slums. "Even the slums are also not being covered completely," said an official.

Experts say that the annual malaria outbreaks can be effectively controlled if things are planned for accordingly.

The reports reflect the start of the monsoon season, and malaria transmission is on the increase in many states in India. New Delhi has previously been regarded as malaria free, but this assessment may have to be revised with increasing numbers of cases being reported. - Mod.EP]
