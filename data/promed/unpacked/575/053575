Health authorities here have warned local residents and tourists about the
sudden surge in the number of dengue fever cases in the province [Cagayan]
after the local department here recorded a 111 per cent rise in dengue
fever cases: 191 cases over the first 5 months of this year as compared
with 90 cases over the same period last year [2009].

With the onset of the rainy season, provincial and health officials believe
there will be a continuous rise in dengue fever cases because of the
increase in stagnant water which is the favorite breeding ground of the
dengue [virus]-carrying mosquitoes.

In order to abate a possible outbreak or epidemic of the dreaded disease in
the coming months, the local health department reminded residents to
observe cleanliness in their surroundings by removing the breeding ground
of dengue [virus]-carrying mosquitoes, particularly their storage
containers of water so that the mosquitoes will not breed on the said places.

At the same time, people suffering from flu-like symptoms must immediately
seek medical attention in the nearest medical facility in their place so
that they will be properly given medical attention to ascertain what kind
of illness they are experiencing.

More cases of dengue fever reported in Ho Chi Minh City
-------------------------------------------------------
The number of dengue fever patients is rising in Ho Chi Minh City due to
unexpected rains in some districts of the city. Currently, around 65 cases
of dengue fever are being detected in the city every week, up 20 per cent
against last week [week of 1 Jun 2010]. In the next few months, the number
of cases is expected to continue to rise in Thu Duc, Tan Phu, Binh Tan, and
Binh Chanh [districts].

The city's health department has advised on drastic measures to prevent
dengue fever in the rainy season and has asked that all localities and
medical centres work together, clean up the environment, and eradicate
mosquito larvae. The city's Children Hospital No 1 has treated 57 cases of
dengue fever as of 4 Jun 2010.

[The newswire above reports the increase of DF/DHF cases in Ho Chi Minh
City. Increases of DF/DHF cases were also reported in An Giang, Da Nang,
and Ha Noi in the early months of 2010 (see prior PRO/MBDS postings listed
below).

However, in its report of 20 May 2010 (available in Vietnamese at
<http://www.moh.gov.vn/homebyt/vn/portal/InfoDetail.jsp?area=58&cat=1456&ID=8602>),
the Viet Nam Ministry of Health reported 3388 DF/DHF cases from 40
provinces and cities; among those, 9 died in May 2010. The accumulated
number of DF/DHF in Viet Nam in 2010 is 12 868 cases, of which 12 died.
Compared with the same period in 2009 (16 635 cases and 14 deaths), the
number of DF/DHF cases has decreased by 22.6 per cent and the number of
deaths due to DF/DHF decreases by 2 cases.

According to the WHO's Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WHO/WPRO)
report available at <http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/mvp/data/dengue/>, there
were a total of 105 370 cases and 87 deaths of DF/DHF reported in Viet Nam

Thailand's Public Health Ministry reported on Tuesday [1 Jun 2010] that
dengue fever has infected 17 587 people and claimed 20 lives nationwide in
the past 5 months, with the infection number increasing by 58 per cent when
compared with the same period last year, The Nation online reported,
quoting the ministry's permanent secretary Paiji Warachit. Paiji said the
dengue fever outbreak would peak during Thailand's rainy season from June
to August.

Most dengue victims were aged 10 to 24 years, said the ministry. The
Central region was the hardest hit with 7945 cases, followed by 4264 in the
South, 3753 in the Northeast, and 1625 in the North.

The Department of Disease Control's director general Manit Teeratantikanont
said the dengue virus type 1 has been widely spreading this year, but
people are also at risk as most do not have immunity against dengue virus
type 2 and type 3.

To tackle the outbreak, the ministry has set up a committee teamed up with
23 people from state agencies including the Bangkok Metropolitan
Administration and the Ministry of Interior. The committee will be chaired
by the ministry's deputy permanent secretary Siriwat Thiptaradol.

Talking about specific measures, Paiji said the health officials are
required to report any disease cases found within 24 hours and mobile teams
will be sent immediately to counter the outbreak. Local authorities have
been advised to spray insecticide at least once a week to eradicate the
dengue [virus]-bearing adult _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito which bites humans in
the daylight hours, he said.

In 2010, a total of 45 people have suffered from dengue in the district and
out of it; 30 belonged to Kasargod taluk [a taluk is a division of local
government within a district in some Indian states]. Maximum number of
cases are reported in Kuttikol Gram Panchayat, where 15 people were
reported to be suffering from dengue fever and one died.

In 2009, 48 people had dengue fever, wherein 30 people belonged to Kasargod
taluk. Fever, eye strain, body pain, muscle pain, vomiting, stomach pain,
redness in stool, and weakness are the symptoms of dengue fever. The fever
[virus] spreads through mosquitos belonging to _Aedes_ family [genus].
Mosquitos in areca nut [the Areca palm (_Areca catechu_)] rubber
plantations, too, may cause [transmit] the disease [virus].

Health officials are stepping up their efforts to avert a dengue outbreak
in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo. According to the Ministry of Health's
Epidemiology Unit, 1806 dengue cases were reported in the city of more than
half a million people in May [2010], resulting in 9 deaths, for a total 95
deaths this year. In 2009, 4813 cases were reported, with 42 deaths, in
Colombo.

"We are taking this situation seriously," chief medical officer for the
Colombo Municipal Council, Pradeep Kariyawasam, told IRIN. Teams of city
workers are now going door-to-door to inspect homes and schools for
possible breeding grounds for the vector-borne disease [virus], Kariyawasam
said, while at the same time raising awareness among residents. Any
container or surface where stagnant water can accumulate is a problem,
Kariyawasam added. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the
removal of mosquito breeding sites is the most important step in mitigating
risk.

Epidemic levels are observed every 4 years, authorities say. The city is
now on high alert given prevailing weather conditions. Incessant rains
beginning in mid-May led to the displacement of 13 000 people in western
and southern Sri Lanka, including Colombo District and parts of the city,
with upcoming monsoon rains over the next 2 months expected to exacerbate
conditions. With heavy rains, most mosquito-breeding areas get washed away,
but with continuous drizzle, there is a higher chance of breeding grounds
remaining intact, Kariyawasam warned.

According to Prishanthy Wijesinghe, a senior health official with the
Ministry of Health's Epidemiology Unit, the government has a comprehensive
programme to counter dengue. "Every year [at] this time... there is
increased risk of dengue. However, this year we are seeing a further
increase in the cases," he said.

Sri Lanka's Dengue Control Unit was established in 2005; it has dispatched
300 medical officers countrywide to monitor the situation. The data is then
processed in Colombo. In 2009, 35 007 cases were reported nationwide -- an
increase of more than 400 percent (6555) on the previous year [2008]. Of
these, the highest number -- 7048 -- were reported in June, followed by
6872 in July. Some 346 people died of dengue in 2009 across the island
nation, the unit reported. In January this year [2010], 4672 cases were
reported against 1279 cases a year earlier [2009]. The Epidemiology Unit
expects the number of dengue cases to rise drastically given monsoon rains
in June and July.

Supriya Warusavithana, a WHO health officer, told IRIN that dengue cases
are mostly reported in Jaffna, Gampaha, Colombo, Kandy, Matale and
Batticoloa and Western and Sabaragamuwa Provinces.

In an effort to mitigate the risks, the WHO is working closely with the
authorities to provide doctors around the country with extensive training
to diagnose and manage the disease.

<http://www.mayottehebdo.com/content/view/2476/47/>


As part of the epidemiological surveillance set up in Mayotte, new cases of
dengue have been identified. The epidemiological assessment has risen from
26 cases to 32 confirmed cases (including 11 locally acquired cases), 19
probable cases (including 16 locally acquired cases). Confirmed cases are
spread throughout the island and no severe form [of the infection] has been
identified.

The downward trend of the circulation of dengue virus in Mayotte observed
in the previous week [week of 23 May] has not been confirmed. The
identification of confirmed cases indicates a local source. The number of
confirmed cases of dengue on the island remains weak, without detection in
households. In case of any sudden onset of fever associated with headache,
muscle pain, rash, nausea, vomiting, bleeding or fatigue, see a doctor.

The recent increase in the number of people who consulted their physician
for dengue is unlikely to reassure the health services. Headache, high
fever: for 6 months, the infectious disease [virus] transmitted by _Aedes
aegypti_ has indeed resulted in the hospitalization of more than 7300
people in Guadeloupe.

The sectors most affected involve the Grande Terre, particularly Le Moule,
Saint-Francois and Les Abymes, and more recently Three Rivers and
Terre-de-Haut to Basse-Terre. Given the high temperatures and increased
rainfall, an increase of mosquitoes and an increase of virus circulation
are still feared.

The epidemic occurred since December [2009] comes at an unusual period, but
still small-scale compared to that of the traditional rainy season,
according to Jean-Louis Chappert, a medical epidemiologist in the National
Institute of Veille Sanitaire (INVS ) in the Region.

The measures adopted by the Management Committee of dengue epidemics who
last met on 7 May [2010] remains valid: the maintenance of epidemiological
surveillance, implementation of a communication plan (posters, radio spots,
mobilizing partners and networks), broadening and strengthening of control
operations on sensitive sites (schools, early childhood) and enlargement of
spraying insecticides.

The gradual increase in the number of cases clinically and biologically
confirmed by sentinel physicians [physicians who receive dengue cases, not
physicians who themselves become ill. - Mod.TY], forcast a rainy season
particularly conducive to the spread of dengue.

What extra care with emphasis on electric diffusers insecticides (inside)
and mosquito coils (outside) and removing items that may accumulate
rainwater around dwellings (flower pots, clay pots, vases .. etc.).

In case of high fever, avoid taking aspirin and anti-inflammatories and
consult your doctor.

Dengue: 1st fatal case in La Martinique
---------------------------------------
A girl of 10 years died on Monday [7 Jun 2010] after contracting dengue
virus. The child, suffering from sickle cell anemia could not resist the
virus. Currently, analyses are still being conducted in Guyana, to confirm
that the dengue virus was the leading cause of death.

To date, nearly 500 people have contracted the virus, some developing
severe forms such as DHF. As just illustrated by this terrible tragedy, it
is unfortunately the children who are the most vulnerable.

There is at present no vaccine or effective treatment. Only preventive
actions can prevent the spread of the mosquito vector of the virus, _Aedes
aegypti_. This [mosquito] can breed in containers such as clay vessels,
metal drums, tanks cement used for preservation of domestic water, and
abandoned plastic containers, old tires and other objects of accumulated
rainwater. It is also highly recommended to sleep under a mosquito net, use
repellents and cover up skin, to avoid bites.

The dengue epidemic in Sao Paulo state is now the worst in its history,
pointed out by a survey of the Secretariat of Health, despite that the
number of cases in May 2010 is 80 per cent lower than in the previous
month. The totals from the state Secretariat of Health reported on the
evening of last Friday [11 Jun 2010] reported a total of 121 270 cases of
the disease were notified in 2010, compared with 92 345 [dengue cases] that
occurred in 2007, until then, the worst epidemic year.

The 98 deaths this year [2010] are also an historical record as already
pointed out by the office in early May. The survey showed that 78.6 per
cent of the infections were concentrated in 50 cities in all of Sao Paulo.
The peak of cases occurred in March this year, with 44 920 infections.

Of the total of 121 270 confirmed [dengue] cases between January and May
this year [2010], 22 710 were registered in the city of Ribeirao Preto and
another 11 185 in Sao Jose do Rio Preto. Guaruja had 8048 occurrences and
Santos 7860.

The secretariat attributed the increase reaching high prevalence to the
rains, especially in the 1st 3 months of the year, that were propitious for
the proliferation of the dengue mosquito [vector]. However, in 2008 there
was a reduction in preventive action.
