The Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture on [Sun 1 Apr 2018] announced the detection of 2 cases of H5N8 avian flu in Al-Kharj governorate, reported the Saudi Press Agency.

Saudi authorities are actively taking measures to contain the virus. In its daily briefing, the ministry affirmed that the number of samples collected from different parts of the Kingdom since the 1st case was reported reached 12 829. Out of the samples, only 171 tested positive for the virus.

Bird flu strains have hit poultry flocks in a number of countries across the world in recent years, with some types of the disease also causing human infections and deaths.

H5N8 is highly pathogenic to birds (high death rates) and was 1st discovered in Ireland in 1983. Since then it has been reported in numerous locations around the world. This strain, however, has not caused any human infections so far anywhere in the world.

According to an Arab News report published in January [2018], the Saudi Wildlife Authority (SWA) enforced a ban on the hunting of migratory birds to help prevent avian influenza. The migratory birds include houbara bustards, passerines, flamingos, pelicans, cranes and turtle doves.

They temporarily stay, mainly in Al-Hair in Riyadh, Al-Asfar Lake, Jubail Marine Protected Area, Domat Al-Jandal in Al-Jouf, Farasan Islands and Wadi Aljizan. They will leave at the start of spring.
