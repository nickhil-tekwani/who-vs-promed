Epidemiological comments: A private veterinarian 1st found suspicious
cases in the affected farm and reported them to the local
government's veterinary Services on 8 Apr 2010. The local veterinary
services ran the antibody detection ELISA, but it showed negative
results. Since the affected cattle showed suspected clinical signs,
they reported the incidence to the National Veterinary Research and
Quarantine Service (NVRQS) on the same day. The NVRQS confirmed those
cattle were infected with serotype O of foot and mouth disease virus
by RT-PCR tests on 9 April 2010.

Various animal health measures have been implemented on that farm
including movement restrictions and disinfection. The stamping-out
and an epidemiological investigation have also been initiated.

Control measures
Measures applied: Stamping out; Quarantine; Movement control inside
the country; Screening; Zoning; Disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s); Vaccination prohibited; No treatment of
affected animals.

[This outbreak, caused by FMDV serotype O, is bad news: it is not
related to the previous 2010 epizootic in South Korea which was
caused by serotype A and was declared resolved on 11 Mar 2010.

Subscribers are referred to information from China, where serotype A
has been affecting cattle while serotype O has been identified in
cattle and swine; the latter is generally known as an invasive
serotype. It may be assumed that the epizootic situation in China has
implications upon its neighbour countries; genotyping is expected, to
provide the definite data.

The situation in the country separating South Korea from China,
namely North Korea, remains obscure.
