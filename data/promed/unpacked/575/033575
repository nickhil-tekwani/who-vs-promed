Danish officials say they suspect that sausage contaminated with _Listeria [monocytogenes]_ bacteria has killed at least 12 people.

The infection is thought to have come from pork sausages called rullepoelse [rolled sausage], made by a firm in Hedehusene, near the capital Copenhagen. The product has now been withdrawn from sale.

So far 8 other people have tested positive for _Listeria_. Deaths occur mostly among people who are already in a weak condition. The outbreak began last September [2013]. Denmark's state health agency SSI says the outbreak is believed to be under control.

Health officials are trying to determine if any of the contaminated meat was sent to schools or restaurants, or was exported.

Listeriosis symptoms often include fever, headache, diarrhoea, and vomiting. The incubation period can last 2 months, making it often difficult to trace the source of contamination.

_Listeria_ can spread from delicatessen food even when kept cool in a refrigerator.

Since September last year [2013], 12 people have died of listeriosis and a further 8 have been infected after consuming some bad 'rullepoelse' sandwich meat.

The food product authorities Foedevarestyrelsen [Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries] suspect that the bad meat originated from Joern A Rullepoelser in Hedehusene near Copenhagen and have closed down the producer. [The meat producer was ordered shut late Mon 11 Aug 2014, and all products recalled (http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/10-feared-dead-denmark-listeria-outbreak-24943819)].

The 20 infected patients consist of 11 women and 9 men aged 43-89 from various parts of Denmark, according to the national serum institute, Statens Seruminstitut.

"From September 2013 until today [12 Aug 2014], 20 patients have been registered suffering from listeriosis, which is an aspect of the outbreak," Statens Seruminstitut wrote in a press release.

"Most cases have however occurred recently. In June, July, and August [2014], 15 cases have been registered alone."

[3] Norway alert

Norwegian citizens who have bought or have meat from Denmark are being asked to search their fridges, looking for the _Listeria [monocytogenes]_ bacterium that has taken 12 lives in Denmark this week.

The Norwegian Food Safety Authority recommended on Tuesday [12 Aug 2014] consumers who have recently bought or received food from Denmark be vigilant and check their food stocks. The warning follows 20 people in Denmark falling ill from contaminated food and 12 of those victims dying.

Turid Berglund, senior advisor for the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, said: "We ask everyone who shopped for food in Denmark recently to listen out for any information from the Danish authorities. Please take a look in your fridge to see if you have any meat products bought from Denmark.

The source of contamination is thought to be a type of cold cut meat. The Danish authorities have so far not confirmed which product it is, but suspicion is directed towards head cheese or rolled sausage ("Rullepoelse"), from the company "Joern A Rullepoelser A/S" in Hedehusene, Denmark.

The products are sold in the supermarket chains "SuperBest", "Eurospar", and select "Spar" stores. Berglund said: "If you have such a package, then we ask you to throw it in the bin. We have no reason to suspect other Danish food groceries sold in Norway."

Berglund advised it is usually people already unwell -- high-risk groups -- who are most exposed to becoming ill from _Listeria_. She still encouraged Norwegians having had their vacation in Denmark, and bought Danish meat products there, to check who produced it. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority now awaits confirmation from Denmark on where the possibly contaminated products are sold and if they could have been distributed to Norway. Danish authorities have attacked the caution coming from Norway. The Danes said they cannot connect the deaths in their country directly to _Listeria_ contamination, since the dead people already had a weakened health from other diseases.

The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration told Danish newspaper "Politiken" that patients at hospitals and nursing homes had been served head cheese or other infected meat cuts. The officials fear also kindergartens, canteens and restaurants had bacteria-infected meat on their menus.

Production at "Joern A Rullepoelser A/S" has been stopped and the brand has withdrawn 30 different types of cold cuts from the supermarket shelves. Palle Andersen, director of "Joern A Rullepoelser A/S", said to NTB his firm has done everything to keep the production under control. Andersen said: "For us it is incomprehensible that our products still contain _Listeria_ bacteria. It is even more difficult to relate to the fact that people became sick or died as a consequence of it."

[This listeriosis outbreak is said to be ongoing for the past year, although most cases (15 of the 20 cases) occurred only recently in June, July, and August 2014. Apparently the implicated food source (rullepoelse) was being sold for this entire time, only being recalled on Mon 11 Aug 2014. Some product may still be in consumers' refrigerators. A warning about the Danish _Listeria_-contaminated rullepoelse has also appeared directed at Norwegian consumers; see item [3] above.

Rullepoelse, meaning "rolled sausage" in Danish, is a piece of pork belly (also can be made with beef flank or lamb) that is flattened out and spread with herbs and seasoning (salt, pepper, allspice), chopped onions and in some variants also parsley, then rolled up, placed in a brine for a number of days and then placed in a special press, cooled and sliced thinly as a cold cut for the Danish open-faced sandwich, smoerrebroed; usually garnished with a thick slice of gelatinized bouillon (Danish, sky) and rings of raw onion (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiced_meat_roll). A similar "rolled sausage" is also eaten in Norway and Sweden.

Comparison of the molecular characteristics, such as PFGE, of _Listeria monocytogenes_ strains isolated from the Danish cases with each other and with isolates from suspected foods would help to establish whether a common source was involved and what would be the most likely source.
