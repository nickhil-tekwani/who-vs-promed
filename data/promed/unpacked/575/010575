Warning to UK horse owners after several atypical myopathy cases
reported
----------------------------------------------------------------------
World Horse Welfare has been made aware of several cases of equine
atypical myopathy (EAM) in the UK, and is urging horse owners to
monitor their own horses.

Liphook Equine Hospital in Hampshire [England] have issued an alert
that they have diagnosed 5 cases in the past few days. 2 of the 5
diagnosed horses have died. Liphook are also aware of a further 4
cases attended by veterinarians which have died in the
Hampshire/Sussex/Surrey area.

EAM is a disease of unknown cause which results in significant muscle
damage. The condition, which seems to be becoming more common, affects
horses at pasture, often in the spring and/or autumn, and has a high
death rate. Similarities of the disease have been made with equine
grass sickness as it is a pasture related disease that appears to be
associated with an adverse change in weather conditions (such as,
sudden frost, heavy rain).

Signs to look out for include:
- Weakness and stiffness in horses at pasture - not related to
excessive/unusual exercise
- Dark coloured urine
- Collapse
- Muscle tremors.

Notably, for a day or 2 prior to referral to Liphook, the 5 horses
also displayed clinical signs less well-recognised in atypical
myopathy cases. These signs included:
- Vigorous head shaking and nodding
- Frenzied vocalisation
- Recurrent choke-like retching neck spasms without a persistent
oesophageal obstruction
- Stiffness and lethargy when ridden

Intensive treatment of any case is required as soon as possible to
maximise its chances of survival. If you suspect your horse has
atypical myopathy contact your vet immediately and remove the horse
from the pasture.

Any other animals that are grazing with the horse you are concerned
about should also be removed from the affected pastures immediately,
as it is possible that there is a toxin in the grass, released only
during changing weather conditions, which causes the disease. Further
information on the disease can be obtained from

[Earlier this year (2011), researchers in Switzerland suggested that
_Clostridium sordellii_ toxins could be suspected as the possible
cause of equine atypical myopathy (EAM). Final evidence is still in
wait; see ProMED mail post 20110410.1139. - Mod.AS
