Trichinellosis, a disease of pigs considered to be eradicated from Europe, has reemerged in some feral hogs in Benarraba, Gaucin and, particularly, Casares.

The latest cases detected were acquired during a hunting session in a field in Benarraba. The positive case was confirmed by a veterinarian, Alonso Badillo, and also by the mayor, Silvestre Barroso, who showed concern about the finding and asked that control measures be undertaken. The main focus seems to be in Casares, by the border with Benarraba and Gaucin.

On Monday [3 Dec 2012], representatives from the 3 implicated towns got together to agree upon more stringent controls. There is concern that families who usually slaughter animals for food, which is a common practice following the economic crisis, do not insure the safety of their meat. Control measures will be directed at making sure that all feral animals killed are tested by veterinary officials.

[Despite the claims that trichinellosis had been eradicated from Europe, there have been a number of cases reported over the last decades, mainly due to ingestion of horse meat. The country with the largest number of cases is Romania.
