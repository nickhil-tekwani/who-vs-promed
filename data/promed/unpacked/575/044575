Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Under the passive epidemiological surveillance system for poultry diseases, mortality was reported in heavy breeders on a multi-age farm; poultry showed clinical signs and lesions consistent with fowl typhoid (_Salmonella gallinarum_). Routine bacteriological and relevant biochemical tests were performed, and _Salmonella gallinarum_ was diagnosed on [1 Oct 2020]. The affected farm has been quarantined, and farms in the area are subject to epidemiological surveillance with restrictions on bird movement and continuous surveillance by sampling. Disease presence has not been detected during investigations in the 10-km radius zone around the outbreak nor in farms epidemiologically linked to the affected farm; therefore, disease presence is restricted to the affected farm.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; screening; traceability; quarantine; zoning; disinfection; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Fowl typhoid in chickens and turkeys is caused by _S. gallinarum_ biovar _Gallinarum_ and is more often observed in the later growing period and in mature stock. Disease is often characterized by rapid spread with high morbidity and acute or subacute mortality. Red mites may be involved in the transmission of disease and persistence in poultry houses.

Clinical signs of fowl typhoid are typical of a septicemic condition in poultry and include increased mortality and poor quality in chicks hatched from infected eggs. Older birds show signs of anemia, depression, labored breathing, and diarrhoea causing adherence of faeces to the vent."

_Salmonella gallinarum_ poses a minimal zoonotic risk.
