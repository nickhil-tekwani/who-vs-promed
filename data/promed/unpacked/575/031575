Health officials closed a China Grove, NC, restaurant linked to a
deadly _Escherichia coli_ outbreak on Mon 18 Jun 2007 after learning
some employees slaughtered a goat there in May 2007.
At a news conference, Rowan County Health Director Leonard Wood said
that on Fri 15 Jun 2007 a former employee of Captain's Galley Seafood
Restaurant in China Grove told health officials a goat had been
slaughtered in the kitchen. Wood said the restaurant's owners
confirmed the goat slaughter over the weekend. News of the slaughter
was "very disturbing" to him and the restaurant's owners, Wood said.
"They don't know if or when the restaurant will reopen," he said.
On Thu 14 Jun 2007 an 86-year-old Salisbury resident died at Rowan
Regional Medical Center of complications related to an infection of a
dangerous strain of the bacterium _E. coli_ [O157:H7]. She was one of
21 people who got sick after eating at the restaurant, Wood said.
Health officials said they interviewed 26 employees and heard
conflicting stories. The goat was slaughtered sometime between 11 and
20 May 2007, Wood said. Restaurant patrons got sick between 26 May
and 3 Jun 2007, Wood said.
Health officials cannot prove the outbreak of the intestinal disease
was caused by the goat slaughter, Wood said. It will be hard to
establish a link without finding part of the goat carcass. "I'm not
sure we'll ever be able to confirm the goat (as the source of the
illness), or anything, for that matter," he said.
Greensboro lawyer David Brown, who represents the restaurant owner,
said he believes 2 or 3 employees were involved. One had been with
the restaurant for a while and was a person "in whom we had
confidence," Brown said. The other 2 employees were recent hires, he said.
Brown said he was told the goat wasn't killed "for some religious or
cultural reason, but simply a desire to cook the goat and eat it."
Brown also said the employees bought the goat from a local farmer and
brought it into the restaurant after hours, Brown said. The employees
killed the goat in the kitchen, but took it elsewhere to cook, Brown
said. The attorney said the employees didn't use the restaurant's utensils.
Health officials announced the _E. coli_ outbreak on 7 Jun 2007.
Officials said they learned of another suspected case of _E. coli_ on
18 June 2007, bringing the total to 8 confirmed cases and 13 suspected cases.

[The association of _E. coli_ O157 and restaurants is not new and, in
fact, undercooked ground beef from a fast food chain caused the
initial outbreak of the disease in 1982 (1). Since then, outbreaks
have occurred related to ground beef and a variety of other vehicles
including unpasteurized cow's milk, contaminated water (for swimming
or drinking), petting zoos and contaminated uncooked vegetables.
Other domesticated animals have also been associated with the
organism besides bovines, including goats (caprines). Outbreaks have
been associated with unpasteurized goat milk (2) and ProMED has
previously reported cases associated with goat cheese
(20060512.1356). Not surprisingly, goats in petting zoos have been
found to carry the organism in the gastrointestinal tracts (3,4).
Although meat from the slaughtered goat was not available for testing
(hence, no "smoking caprine"), this outbreak is unique for this
possible epidemiologic link.
