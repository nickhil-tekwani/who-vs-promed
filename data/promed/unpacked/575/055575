Mapusa town [Goa] is witnessing an increase in the cases of vector borne diseases, with 650 malaria cases reported from January to April this year [2015]. There were around 600 cases of malaria detected in 2014.

Authorities are now conducting various awareness campaign programmes and precautionary measures to prevent the vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue ahead of the monsoon this year [2015].

Mapusa urban health centre has identified Cunchelim, Karaswada, Acoi, Duler, Ansabhat, and Khorlim as high risk areas. In recent years, malaria cases detected in Mapusa per year were in the range of 300-400, sources informed.

Urban health center, Mapusa, on [Fri 12 Jun 2015] organized an awareness programme at Mapusa municipal hall where representatives of concerned departments of the government, Mapusa municipal councillors, NGOs, scrapyard owners, police, etc., participated. The programme aimed to raise awareness about the disease and to urge families and stakeholders to take action to protect themselves. A core element of the programme was to provide stakeholders with information.

The health officer at the Mapusa urban health center, Dr Cheryl De Souza, said Mapusa has 15 wards with a population of more than 43 276 and that it is very important that everyone cooperate in eradication of the vector borne diseases.

"The health center is making all efforts to eradicate vector borne diseases, Mapusa has potential high risk areas, cooperation from each member of the society is essential to eradicate this health hazard," De Souza said. Mapusa urban health center has also initiated a drive wherein a survey is conducted to check for infected persons and also provide people with heath cards.

Deputy director of directorate of health services Dr Sachin Govekar has appealed to the people to keep their houses and surroundings clean. He also requested Mapusa municipality to register all wells in its jurisdiction with water and resources department.

"Wells are breeding sites for mosquitoes. If wells are registered then proper maintenance can be undertaken by the department and mosquito breeding can be controlled, which can prevent the spread of many diseases," Dr Sachin Govekar said.

[Malaria is endemic in many parts of India. According to the WHO World Malaria Report for 2014, Goa is free of malaria (http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2014/wmr-2014-profiles.pdf). However, there is little doubt that the reporting of malaria in India only covers a fraction of the real number of cases and as the numbers cited in the World Malaria Report are the notified cases, that distribution is probably not reflecting the real incidence and geographical distribution.

Current guidelines from major European centers do not recommend malaria prophylaxis for visitors to Goa. However, the CDC (Yellow Book) does recommend prophylaxis for visitors: "Although the intensity of malaria may be related to the season, unlike other countries in Asia, malaria is holoendemic (endemic at a high level in a population) in India (except at altitudes greater than 2000 m (6561 ft) and occurs in both rural and urban areas. Rates of _Plasmodium falciparum_ have increased in the last 2 decades, and thus chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all destinations" (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-4-select-destinations/india).

ProMED-mail will be interested in reports of malaria in visitors returning from Goa. - Mod.EP
