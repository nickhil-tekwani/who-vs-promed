USA, Germany, South Korea: Remdisivir
-------------------------------
USA
The United States has bought nearly all the available global supplies for the next 3 months of anti-viral drug remdesivir, one of 2 drugs that have proven to be effective against COVID-19. The US Department of Health Services (HHS) announced on Monday [29 Jun 2020] it had secured more than 500 000 treatment courses of remdesivir from drugmaker Gilead Sciences for US hospitals until September [2020].

Remdesivir, which is administered intravenously in hospital, is the 1st drug to show improvement in COVID-19 patients in formal clinical trials, and new information about its efficacy is being closely watched around the world, as nations battle the coronavirus pandemic.

US FDA allows emergency use of remdesivir drug for coronavirus. In May [2020], US regulators allowed the emergency use of the experimental drug that appears to help some patients recover faster. The drug has received full approval by Japanese health regulators. US approval requires a time-consuming Food and Drug Administration review, but Emergency Use Authorisations can be used in a health crisis when other options are not available.

There are currently no US approvals for treatments or vaccines for the new coronavirus that has infected more than 10 million people and killed nearly 500 000 worldwide, including more than 127 000 deaths in the US. Dozens of companies are working on a variety of treatment and vaccine approaches. Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host's immune system.

Germany
Germany has for now secured enough supplies of remdesivir, which is set to become the 1st COVID-19 treatment approved in Europe, and is banking on developer Gilead to meet future needs, the country's health ministry said.

"The federal government has early on secured remdesivir for the treatment of coronavirus patients. Currently, there are still sufficient reserves," the ministry told Reuters in a written statement.

On Monday [29 Jun 2020], Gilead said it would price remdesivir at $2340 per patient in the US and other wealthier nations. In 127 poor or middle-income countries, Gilead is allowing generic makers to supply the drug.

Last month [June 2020], according to initial findings, a cheap and widely used steroid called dexamethasone was proven to save lives among critically ill COVID-19 patients in what scientists and the World Health Organization hailed as a breakthrough in the fight against the virus.

South Korea
South Korea has started using remdesivir, an experimental drug originally developed for Ebola, to treat its seriously ill COVID-19 patients. Yonhap news agency says the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed an agreement with Gilead Sciences, which holds a patent for the drug. It did not disclose the amount of remdesivir it would buy or the price.


Australia: lockdown
----------------
Authorities in Australia will lock down more than 300 000 people in suburbs north of Melbourne, for a month, in a bid to contain the risk of infection after 2 weeks of double-digit rises in new cases.

EU: border reopenings
--------------------
Spain and Portugal
Spain and Portugal reopened their shared border, which has been closed since 16 Mar [2020] as Lisbon sought to protect itself from new cases that were exploding across Spain. With its only land border closed for more than 3 months, Portugal has weathered the epidemic better than its neighbour: 1576 deaths from 42 141 cases compared with Spain's 28 355 deaths from almost 250 000 cases.

European Union
The European Union has reopened its borders to visitors from 15 countries but excluded the United States, where deaths are spiking once again, and a top health official warned the country was heading in the "wrong direction." The final list of nations safe enough to allow residents to enter the EU did not include Russia, Brazil, or the US, where the daily death toll passed 1000 on Tuesday [30 Jun 2020] for the 1st time since 10 Jun [2020].

North Korea, Thailand: schools
-----------------------------
North Korea
North Korea has reopened schools but has kept a ban on public gatherings and made it mandatory for people to wear masks in public places as part of its response to the coronavirus threat, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said. While North Korea has not confirmed any infections, its Ministry of Public Health has been sharing weekly updates with the WHO on steps it is taking to ward off the pandemic, said Edwin Salvador, the agency's representative to the reclusive country.

In the latest update provided on 19 Jun [2020], the ministry said all educational institutions are now open, with children required to wear masks and washing stations installed.

Thailand
Thailand has further eased COVID-19 restrictions, allowing the reopening of schools and entertainment venues such as restaurants and massage parlors that had been shut since mid-March [2020]. It also is allowing in foreign visitors on a controlled basis, limiting entry to those with existing family or work ties, students, technical experts, and investors. Scheduled passenger flights to Thailand were suspended in early April [2020]. The number of foreign visitors allowed into the country each day is limited to 200, and they are supposed to travel on repatriation flights bringing Thai citizens home.

Greece, Egypt, Japan: tourism
-------------------------
Greece
Greece has prepared to welcome tourist flights to its island destinations for the 1st time in months, as it raced to salvage a tourism season shredded by the coronavirus pandemic.

More than 100 flights from other EU nations and a select group of non-EU countries are expected at 14 regional airports including Corfu, Santorini, Mykonos, Rhodes, and Crete, airport operator Fraport said. Flights from the UK, one of its most lucrative travel markets, are not due to restart until 15 Jul [2020] at the earliest, in line with EU recommendations. The same applies to the United States, Russia, Turkey, and Sweden.

Egypt
Egypt has reopened its airports, the Egyptian museum, and the famed Giza Pyramids in Cairo for the 1st time in more than 3 months since the coronavirus closure.

The national carrier, EgyptAir, said around 2000 passengers left Cairo's international airport on 14 international flights on Wednesday [1 Jul 2020]. Two flights carrying over 350 Ukrainian tourists landed in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada and the major resort and beach destination of Sharm el Sheikh in the southern part of Sinai Peninsula.

Japan
Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea have reopened after being closed for 4 months due to the coronavirus pandemic. The 2 parks have new guidelines, including limiting the number of entrants in 3 shifts to maintain social distancing. No handshakes, hugging, or photos taken with Mickey Mouse and other characters are allowed.

[Takeaway messages: Premature lifting of restrictions leads to resurgences of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Many of the population think that lifting of restrictions means the virus is gone, so non-pharmaceutical measures such as face masks and social distancing are also unnecessary. However, the impending public pressure and economic crisis has led to many countries easing restrictions and opening air travel and land borders. Some are testing monitored opening of schools, while others continue to impose restrictions in "hotspot" areas. Solution: lift restrictions when criteria are met re: decreasing transmission in an area, and do so with increased risk communication to ensure the proper messages are consistently communicated. And do something about the politics of health leading to the mixed messages the population is receiving. - Mod.UBA]

[The outbreak in Beijing continues with 3 newly confirmed cases attributed to the outbreak. The 1st case in Beijing was reported on 11 Jun 2020; as of 1 Jul 2020, there have been 329 cases reported from Beijing, 21 in Hebei, and 3 in Liaoning, most likely associated with this outbreak.

There were 2 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals and no new conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, there have been 29 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infections reported by China.

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with the SARS-CoV-2, many of whom are detected as asymptomatic at the time of positive PCR testing. Cases are still being confirmed in Beijing.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 54 cases with no new deaths, compared with 51 cases and no new deaths in the previous day (30 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 80 consecutive days. There were 44 locally transmitted cases: Gwangju (22), Seoul (13), Gyeonggi (5), Chungnam (2), Daejeon (1), and Daegu (1); and 10 imported cases: Gyeonggi (5), airport quarantine (2), Daegu (2), and Chungnam (1). There were 11 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases.

According to data from the "ncov" website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the cumulative confirmation rate has been 1.0% (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/).

The overall impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. But that being said, importations are also playing a major role in the country. It would be nice to know the asymptomatic rate being detected, and the proportion of asymptomatic infections detected that go on to clinical disease.

Tabular and graphic analyses of the situation in South Korea with the addition of the 51 newly confirmed cases from 30 Jun 2020 are available at the English language page (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030), notices 408 and 409. There are analyses of the countrywide situation, including the newly confirmed cases and listings of current ongoing clusters; 2 of the clusters mentioned are related to religious gatherings, 1 is related to automobile component manufacturer company, and 1 is related to an apartment complex.

Importations came from Americas (1), Asia excluding China (14) (Kazakhstan 8, Iraq 3, Pakistan 2, Philippines 1), Kyrgyzstan (1), and Uzbekistan (1).

Takeaway message: Importations continue to be a challenge, and gatherings whether social or religious are key foci for enlarging clusters (unchanged from previous 2 days' messages).

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +182 cases and +21 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (30 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was +142 cases and +23 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (109). Emilia-Romagna (16) and Piedmont (16) are the only other provinces reporting 10 or more cases. A total of 18 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (7 provinces reported no new cases). Italy is now 57 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 41 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. For more detailed information on the outbreak, I suggest going to the source URL above.

As many as 2549 people have been infected with the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the past 24 hours in Iran, said Sima Sadat Lari, spokesperson for Iran's Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Trend reports, citing the ministry. According to Sadat Lari, 141 people have died from the coronavirus over the past day. Sadat Lari added that the condition of 3081 people is critical.

The official said that the situation remains dire in Khuzestan, Kermanshah, Kurdistan, Hormozgan, Bushehr, Razavi Khorasan East Azerbaijan, and West Azerbaijan provinces.
So far, more than 1.69 million tests have been conducted in Iran for the diagnosis of coronavirus.

Iran continues to monitor the coronavirus situation in the country. According to recent reports from the Iranian officials, over 230 200 people have been infected, and 10,958 people have already died. Meanwhile, over 191 400 have reportedly recovered from the disease.

The country continues to apply strict measures to contain the further spread. Reportedly, the disease was brought to Iran by a businessman from Iran's Qom city, who went on a business trip to China, despite official warnings. The man died later from the disease.

The Islamic Republic of Iran only announced its 1st infections and deaths from the coronavirus on 19 Feb [2020].

Takeaway message: Premature lifting of restrictions is taking its toll in Iran as it is elsewhere in the world. Unfortunately, many people think that lifting of restrictions means the virus has gone away, and measures like mask wearing and social distancing are no longer necessary.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data for the top 20 reporting entities. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 779 953, including 130 798 deaths, an increase from 2 727 853 cases and 130 122 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 212 412 cases as of 14:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 1 Jul 2020, including 18 497 confirmed deaths and an additional 4607 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Texas, California, Florida, Arizona, Georgia, Tennessee, Louisiana, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Ohio. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All but Ohio reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1256 to 8240. Both Texas and California each reported around 8000 cases.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California, New Jersey, Texas, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona. The same ranking as yesterday (30 Jun 2020). A total of 41 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 1.7%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 40.7%, higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country picking up momentum.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, the percentages of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay is 10%, consistent with the ongoing, as yet not-under-control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 1 Jul 2020.

Highlights
----------
- It has never been clearer that communication is an important public health intervention that contributes to controlling pandemics. The WHO Regional Office for Europe discusses this and the risks of an "infodemic" - an overabundance of information, some of which can be misleading or even harmful. WHO launched the 1st Infodemiology conference on 29 Jun [2020], which includes talks with experts on how the infodemic affects the world and reflections on how it can be managed.
- Cambodia has been responding to a measles outbreak at the same time as the COVID-19 outbreak. WHO has supported efforts for routine immunization in Cambodia at healthcare facilities, and in the community through outreach teams.
- WHO has published an update to the scientific brief on smoking and COVID-19, which assesses the available evidence on the risk of smokers being infected by the virus, severity of disease, and deaths among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who smoke.
- The conclusion remains that smoking appears associated with increased severity of disease and death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
- In today's Subject in Focus below, we provide an update on WHO's efforts to bolster the COVID-19 supply chain system.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update (please note that there has been consistent weekend reporting artifact since the presentation of these data began):
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 49.9% of the global newly reported cases and 52.2% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period. The USA reported 43.6% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, and Brazil reported 29.3%, Mexico 4.6%, Chile 4.1%, Colombia 3.9%, Peru 3.6%, and Argentina 2.8%. The same 5 countries remained at the top; the USA and Brazil are usually numbers 1 and 2, although they vary for which of the 2 positions they hold, but other countries are continuing to increase their proportional representation within the region.

The European region reported 16.8% of the global newly reported cases and 14.6% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region. Kazakhstan reported 39.4% [appears to be a bulk reporting] of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Russia 23.7%, Turkey 4.7%, Sweden 2.8%, Israel 2.6%, the UK 2.5%, Ukraine 2.4%, Azerbaijan 2.0%, and Armenia 1.8%. The proportion of cases represented by Russia continues to decrease. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Israel, and Ukraine are prominent in countries noted to have resurgence in Europe.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 11.8% of the global newly reported cases and 13.1% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 22.6%, of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan 21.3%, Iran 12.6%, Iraq 10.1%, Egypt 8.0%, Oman 5.2%, Qatar 5.1%, and Kuwait 3.5%. Multiple countries are very active in the region - same countries in the same order as yesterday (30 Jun 2020).

The African region reported 5.7% of the global newly reported cases and 4.3% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 73.1% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 5.9%, Ghana 4.1%, Algeria 3.5%, Kenya 1.8%, and Central African Republic 1.4%. South Africa and Nigeria are usually numbers 1 and 2 (although Ghana surpassed Nigeria on 29 Jun 2020, but is back to position 3 today) in terms of the 24-hour increase in cases; other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.96% of the global newly reported cases and 0.31% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 68.1% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 15.5%, Japan 8.2%, Australia 4.2%, South Korea 3.2%, and China 0.3%. The outbreak associated with the Beijing seafood markets continues to bring China to prominence in terms of daily newly confirmed cases. That said, the Philippines and Singapore are consistently numbers 1 and 2, respectively, and the other countries, including Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Australia, vary in daily reporting, although today's ordering is identical to yesterday's.

The South-East Asia region reported 14.6% of the global newly reported cases and 15.3% of global deaths. India reported 77.8% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 15.4%, Indonesia 5.4%, and Nepal 1.3%. Same countries, same order as in previous days, with India continuing to be the driving force in the regional growth in cases.

Impression: The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis, followed by the South-East Asia region, then Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean alternating on a daily basis of their order, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily case load of all of the regions. There is still weekend artifact with prominent countries not reporting any cases and others reporting probable backlog from the weekend.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 1 Jul 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the above text. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South-East Asia, in terms of daily newly confirmed cases; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.UBA]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 10 802 849, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 2.0% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.77 million confirmed cases, now represents 25.7% of the global cases of COVID-19, and Brazil with more than 1.45 million cases represents 13.4% of the global cases of COVID-19. Other countries such as Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases as well. If one tallies the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, Russia, India, and the UK), they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (53.7%). A global total of 518 921 deaths have been reported, an increase of 5060 deaths in the past 24 hours.

A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact-tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections are significantly underreported: actual numbers may be 10-20 times larger. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home, who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Russia, Mexico, Colombia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. It's the 1st time Kasakhstan has appeared on this list, reflecting increased transmission in the country. All of these countries are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases went from 3775 to 52 100.

The top 20 countries in terms of cumulative cases include 7 from the European region, 7 from the Americas region, 3 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region (an increase in 1 from the Americas region and decrease in 1 from the Eastern Mediterranean region. There are no countries from the Western Pacific region. The top 20 countries in terms of numbers of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include 7 from the Americas region, 6 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South-East Asia region, 2 from the European region, 1 from the Western Pacific region (the Philippines) and 1 from the African region (an increase of 2 in the South East Asia region, and 1 in the Western Pacific region, and a decrease in 2 from the European region and 1 from the Americas region). Again, there are no countries from the Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world. - Mod.UBA]
