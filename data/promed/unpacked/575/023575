A significant increase in cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) this year [2018] has been reported by the Federal Office of Public Health, which recommends getting vaccinated against the virus. Some 150 people have already been infected with the virus - which in rare cases can be fatal - since the beginning of 2018, the health authorities said in a report external link on [Mon 9 Jul 2018]

In June [2018] alone, 73 people fell ill with early-summer meningoencephalitis. This is a significant increase compared with figures for June for previous years, the health office wrote. From 2000 to 2017, between 46 and 109 cases were reported for the whole year.

The blood-sucking tick is very active early on this year [2018], it said. Significantly more people had sought treatment for tick bites or Lyme disease so far this year [2018]. By the end of June [2018] around 21 300 visits to the doctor concerned tick bites according to a health office projection.

In Switzerland, the tick season starts in March and ends in June, depending on the weather. The health office says ticks are found above all in deciduous forests with lush undergrowth and at an altitude of up to 1500 m [4900 ft]. Only a small proportion of ticks carry the TBE virus, which occurs only in certain areas of Switzerland.

TBE-infected ticks can cause the outbreak of 2 stages of the disease. During a 1st episode, which occurs 7- 14 days after the sting, patients suffer flu-like symptoms such as headaches, fever, fatigue or joint complaints. In 5 -15 percent of those affected, a 2nd stage of the illness develops, which can last for months and may involve symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis. These symptoms can cause paralysis and leave permanent disabilities. About 1 percent of cases are fatal.

The health office recommends vaccination against the TBE virus for people from the age of 6 who live in an area where the disease is endemic.

[Switzerland is experiencing a more active than usual tick-born encephalitis virus transmission season this year (2018). The virus is endemic in certain areas in the country, as well as in some areas in Germany and Austria. In a comment last year (2017) concerning TBE in Switzerland, Dr. Ivo M. Foppa indicated that the incidence of TBE in Switzerland has increased distinctly since 2000, roughly about 50 percent. Comparing the time period from 1985 through 2000 (average reported number of TBE per year 66) with the period from 2001 through 2016 (average reported number of TBE per year 138); the trend is even more obvious. At that time, 2017 may have been on track to exceed the number of TBE cases that were reported in the record year 2006 (245) (see ProMED-mail archive Tick-borne encephalitis - Switzerland (03): comment 20171017.5387144).

WHO has stated that "Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tickborne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far-Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious." (http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/tick_encephalitis/en/)

Tickborne encephalitis is a virus infection caused by one of 3 tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the _Flaviviridae_ family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TY
