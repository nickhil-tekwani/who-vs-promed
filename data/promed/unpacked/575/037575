Newcastle Disease Confirmed in California
-------------------------
Officials with the California Department of Agriculture (CDFA) and the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) are conducting a
campaign to eradicate Newcastle disease. The disease was confirmed on 1
Oct 2002 and is restricted to backyard poultry. Clinical signs in infected
birds include respiratory, nervous, and gastrointestinal signs. Mortality
is up to 90 percent of exposed birds. Commercial poultry, at this time,
are not involved in the disease occurrence. Investigations are ongoing and
all figures are pending final validation.
The following are figures pertaining to the Newcastle disease situation in
California:
Number of premises positive: 17
Number of contacts: 19
Number of premises quarantined: 78
Number of premises depopulated: 31
Premises waiting to be depopulated: 5
Birds depopulated to date: 8043 (approximate)
Counties with Positive Flocks: Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino
State and federal animal health officials are conducting door-to-door
surveys to identify fowl and other birds in the affected areas and are
following up on all epidemiologic associations. To date, depopulation,
cleaning, disinfecting, and carcass disposal are being conducted by CDFA
and APHIS. CDFA has closed all poultry exhibits and fairs and expositions
within the State of California.
The Newcastle disease situation is contained and is still considered a
single outbreak cluster within a 30-mile radius in Los Angeles County and
along the Los Angeles/Riverside/San Bernardino County border.
Affected and exposed backyard poultry are being euthanized, double-bagged,
the bags disinfected, and the carcasses transported to restricted landfills
for burial.
All door-to-door surveillance, along with interviews, has established that
there have been no links to eastern States within the United States and no
exposure to other backyard poultry in other States.
Local commercial table egg layer birds are being closely monitored and will
only be allowed to move intrastate under CDFA monitoring and spent-hen
movements restricted to the day they are scheduled for processing.
Please forward this information to your federal, State, and industry
counterparts as necessary.
If you have questions about this situation please feel free to call USDA,
APHIS, Veterinary Services, Emergency Programs at 301-734-8073 or e-mail:

The State of Californa, along with federal agriculture officials attempting
to contain a month-old outbreak of a deadly bird virus known as Exotic
Newcastle disease, have euthanized more than 8000 birds in Southern
California, including thousands of chickens and dozens of household pet birds.
The devastating infection has not yet spread to California's commercial
poultry operations, most of which are in Northern California, but Canada,
Taiwan, Poland, and Korea already have banned imports of most poultry
products from the state. The European Union has imposed an embargo on live
poultry, hatching eggs, and fresh meat from poultry and game birds from
the United States until the infection is brought under control, officials said.
Officials from the California Department of Food and Agriculture and the US
Department of Agriculture (USDA) have established an emergency Newcastle
disease task force on a military training base in Los Alamitos, about 30
miles south of Los Angeles.
The group now includes 171 officials to inspect hundreds of homes and small
farms in Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino County, where the
infection is feared to have spread. So far, 73 premises have been
quarantined in an effort to contain the virus.
Dr. Richard Breitmeyer, the state of California's chief veterinarian, said
he has seen hopeful signs in recent days that the spread of the infestation
is slowing, although he is far from ready to declare it contained.
"We're not finding a lot of cases of massive die-offs," Breitmeyer said.
"Those occurred 2 to 3 weeks ago when birds were literally dying in front
of our eyes."
He said he has been startled by the number of people in the Los Angeles
megalopolis who keep chickens and other fowl on their property as pets or
sources of food.
"The sheer volume of these backyard birds has been eye-opening to us,"
Breitmeyer said. "Some of these birds, including chickens, are like pets to
these people."
A private veterinarian in Compton, a low-income suburb of Los Angeles,
first spotted the disease late in September 2002. A client brought in a
sick chicken with symptoms similar to those of Newcastle disease: sneezing,
runny beak, weight loss, and lethargy.
The chicken soon died and was submitted to the state lab for testing, where
it came back positive for Newcastle. State animal health experts quickly
moved to try to assess the extent of the infection and began door-to-door
inspections of homes and farms raising birds.
Newcastle disease devastated California's poultry industry in the early
1970s, when 12 million birds were destroyed. The disease was traced to
imported parrots and macaws from Central and South America, which came in
contact with birds from nearby commercial poultry operations. Since then,
federal agriculture officials have set up inspection and quarantine
stations at the borders to try to keep diseased birds out. However, wild
birds and smuggled exotic species and fighting cocks occasionally arrive
carrying the virus. The disease is often transmitted at bird shows,
cockfights and swap meets and can be carried by humans, although it does
not make people sick.
In that regard, it is like foot-and-mouth disease, which is debilitating to
livestock but has little effect on humans, Breitmeyer said. The response by
the authorities is similar: Kill all the diseased animals and any that
might have come in contact with them, then quarantine the premises until
the virus is eradicated by disinfectants. Breitmeyer said it had not been
determined how the disease entered California this time.
Bill Mattos, president of the California Poultry Federation, said he has
warned member farmers to impose stringent biosecurity measures at their
poultry ranches, disinfecting workers when they arrive and leave and giving
them laundered coveralls for each shift. Still, he said, migratory birds
can transmit Newcastle disease, and there's no assurance that it will not
spread northward to California's $2.5 billion poultry industry, with
catastrophic economic results.
"When Newcastle gets into a commercial flock, you might as well kill them
all," he said.
