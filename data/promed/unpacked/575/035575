A virus identical to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is endemic
among wild gorillas in Africa and its source of transmission was
probably through chimpanzees, according to a [report published in the
9 Nov 2006 issue of the journal Nature; see below]. Statistics have
shown that around 40 million people worldwide are living with
HIV/AIDS.
Although monkeys in Africa infected with simian immunodeficiency
virus (SIV) are said to be the source of 2 of the 3 strains of the
virus [HIV] in humans the source of the 3rd has been unknown, until
now. Martine Peeters, a virologist at the University of Montpellier
in France said, "It is the first time that someone has done a survey
among wild gorillas to see whether they were infected with an SIV."
She added: "We showed they were infected and moreover they are
infected with a virus that is closely related to HIV-1 and a
particular variant O."
Humans are believed to have become infected with HIV when they
slaughtered infected chimpanzees for food. Around 25 million people
have died of HIV/AIDS since the virus was identified a quarter of a
century ago. Three strains or groups of HIV -- M, N and O have been
identified. Group M is the most common strain and has spread around
the globe. Strain N is linked to a few cases in Cameroon and group O
represents about one percent of HIV/AIDS cases in Cameroon and
surrounding countries. "It is only there that we find it," Peeters
explained, referring to the O strain.
She and her colleagues have collected and analyzed hundreds of
droppings from wild gorillas and chimpanzees living in remote forest
areas in Cameroon. The animals are hunted for food and medicines even
today. An analysis of the samples showed the gorillas were infected
with a strain of SIV related to the O group. The infected gorillas
lived nearly 400 kilometres (250 miles) apart so the scientists
believe it is likely SIV infection is endemic in the animals.
Peeters, who reported the findings in the journal Nature, said, "We
have discovered it in gorillas but we think the primary reservoir is
still chimpanzees. We think chimpanzees transmitted it to gorillas
but we don't know who transmitted it to humans -- the gorilla or the
chimp."
How the gorillas became infected in the first place is still a
mystery because gorillas are vegetarians and encounters with
chimpanzees are thought to be rare.

[The HIV-1 group O virus is responsible for about one percent of
current human HIV cases in Cameroon. Until the investigation reported
above, group O had not been found in nonhuman primates. Peeters and
her colleagues says it is still too early to say whether western
lowland gorillas are a reservoir species or merely a carrier of the
virus.

The Abstract reads as follows: "Chimpanzees (_Pan troglodytes
troglodytes_) from west central Africa are recognized as the
reservoir of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVcpzPtt) that have
crossed at least twice to humans: this resulted in the AIDS pandemic
(from human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 group M) in one instance and
infection of just a few individuals in Cameroon (by HIV-1 group N) in
another. A third HIV-1 lineage (group O) from west central Africa
also falls within the SIVcpzPtt radiation, but the primate reservoir
of this virus has not been identified. Here we report the discovery
of HIV-1 group O-like viruses in wild gorillas." - Mod.CP]
