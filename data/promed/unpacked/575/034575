[Concerning Hugh Spencer's comment on Tilt and human cleft palate incidence
at Coffs Harbour, we have had the following reply. - Mod.MHJ

From: Omar Shafey <Omar_Shafey@doh.state.fl.us>

Please see EXTOXNET for more information on Tilt (41.8% propiconazole).

-ext.html
Propiconazole (chemical name:
1[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-propyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-ylmethyl-1H-1,2,4-triazo
le) is a systemic fungistatic agent used on a wide variety of agricultural
crops and in forest management. It acts by inhibiting the biosynthesis of
ergosterol by fungi. EXTOXNET's toxicological summary provides no evidence
indicating a teratogenic potential for this chemical:
"Over a two-year period, rats and their offspring were fed a diet
containing propiconazole at concentrations up to 2,500 ppm. Although the
high dose resulted in diminished body weight, and increases in relative
liver weight of adults and pups, no reproductive, foetal, or embryonic
parameters were affected."
"Propiconazole was administered orally in doses up to 300 mg/kg/day during
days 6-15 post-conception in rats, and up to 180 mg/kg/day on days 6-18 of
gestation to Chinchilla rabbits. No teratogenic or foetotoxic effects were
observed from either group, at any dose."
It appears unlikely that propiconazole exposure could be responsible for
alleged increases in the incidence of cleft palate or other fetal
abnormalities among bats or humans in Australia. US EPA would be interested
if there is substantive evidence to the contrary.
