200 people have died of hepatitis in the district over the last 3
years, and thousands more at risk face death. Medical Superintendent,
Civil Hospital, Naushahro Feroze, Dr Abdul Qadir Panhwar, told this
correspondent that about 500 registered hepatitis patients were
waiting for medicines for the last 10 months, and only 300 patients
had been supplied with the medicine. He said 33 constables of the
police headquarters, Naushahro Feroze, were found suffering from
hepatitis B and C after 178 samples of police constables [18.5
percent] were scanned. About 1800 police constables remain to be
scanned, he said. He said around 1000 samples of various villages
could not be tested due to shortage of staff in the Civil Hospital.
He said villages including Aacher Khoso, Dhegano Chandio, Lukar
Brohi, Shakar Brohi, Ramzan Brohi, Ghar Gajoo and Moosa Panhwar were
most affected by the disease in the district.

Talking to this correspondent, Abdul Haleem Chandio, a resident of
village Laiq Chandio, said 35 people, including women and children,
had died due to the disease during the last 3 years, and 39 people
out of the population of 85 were suffering from Hepatitis B in the
village.

Haji Khan Chandio, a resident of village Dhegano Chandio, said 7
people, including women and children of a family, had died due to
this disease in the last 3 years, and 200 people out of the
population of 800 [25 percent] were suffering from Hepatitis B in the
village.

Abdul Riaz Khoso, a resident of village Aacher Khoso, said 20 people,
including women and children, had died of the disease during the last
3 years. 80 people out of a population of 200 [40 percent] are
suffering from Hepatitis B in the village, he said.

A survey conducted by this correspondent revealed that thousands of
cases of hepatitis B and C exist in the district, but there was no
one to scan them. People have been left to die, and there seems to be
no help forthcoming. There is a dire need that the Health Ministry
take immediate notice of the situation and send medical teams to
combat this scourge. A large quantity of medicine [for treatment] of
hepatitis B and C is also required immediately.

It has been learned that PKR 1.5 lakh [about USD 1900] are required
for one patient's treatment, which poor patients cannot afford and so
are worried about their dark future. When this correspondent visited
the affected villages of the district, the villagers complained that
they had not received even one tablet from the Civil Hospital and
that the tests were also not being conducted free of cost. The tests
are expensive and beyond the reach of poor villagers.

[The hepatitis B and C disease situation in the Naushahro Feroze
District of Sindh province of Pakistan is remarkably similar to that
in Badin District of Sindh province (see: Hepatitis B & C - Pakistan:
(SD) 20081201.3773). It is evident that hepatitis B and C disease is
at least a provincial problem, and possibly a national problem.

Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused
by hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem and the
most serious type of viral hepatitis. It can cause chronic liver
disease and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the
liver and liver cancer. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between
people by contact with the blood or other body fluids (i.e. semen and
vaginal fluid) of an infected person. In developing countries, common
modes of transmission include: perinatal (from mother to baby at
birth), early childhood infections (non-apparent infection through
close interpersonal contact with infected household contacts), unsafe
injections practices, blood transfusions, and sexual contact. A
vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis
B vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing HBV infection and its
chronic consequences. A more detailed description is available at:
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/index.html>.

Hepatitis C virus is a major cause of acute hepatitis and chronic
liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Hepatitis C
virus is spread primarily by direct contact with human blood. The
major causes of hepatitis C virus infection worldwide are use of
unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of needles and syringes that
have not been adequately sterilized. No vaccine is currently
available to prevent hepatitis C, and treatment for chronic hepatitis
C is too costly for most persons in developing countries to afford.
Thus, from a global perspective, the greatest impact on hepatitis C
disease burden will likely be achieved by focusing efforts on
reducing the risk of hepatitis C virus transmission from nosocomial
exposures (e.g. blood transfusions, unsafe injection practices) and
high-risk behaviors (e.g. injection drug use). A more detailed
account is available at:
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html>.

Naushahro Feroze District is a district in the northern part of the
province of Sindh, Pakistan. Naushahro Feroze has a population of 1
087 571. The location of Naushahro Feroze District can be found on
