[Except for Luxembourg, the figures above are significantly lower than
figures received from other official sources (see further). This is
probably the outcome of the fact that ADNS reports cover "confirmed
outbreaks", which may be interpreted as laboratory-confirmed. The
definition deserves clarification.

The following data on the recent situation in the affected countries, based
upon information from national websites, have been kindly forwarded to us
by Sabine Zentis who is cordially acknowledged:

1. Belgium: the case numbers as stated by the Belgian authorities are 4571
as of 11 Oct 2007.
2. France: as of 10 Oct 2007, France confirmed more than 4300 cases and
restriction zones have been extended accordingly. A map, updated 10 Oct
2007, is available at
<http://agriculture.gouv.fr/sections/thematiques/sante-protection-animaux/maladies-animales/fievre-catarrhale-ovine/faits-marquants/copy18_of_fco-faits-marquants-du/downloadFile/FichierAttache_1_f0/pds_071007.pdf?nocache=>.

3. Germany: the website of the German ministry has been updated and
confirmed cases stand at 13 893 as at 11 Oct 2007. These numbers include 30
cases in wildlife, although the species affected are not stated. It is
known that a number of roe deer, fallow deer, and mouflon (wild sheep) have
tested positive for the virus. According to the latest developments, the
German Government has published an amended version (no. 21) of the already
existing legislation declaring only small parts of Bavaria, Brandenburg,
and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern as free from bluetongue infection.
4. Luxembourg: the situation in Luxembourg is similar with ADNS information
dated 12 Oct 2007 (see above). Cases are distributed evenly across the
country.
5. Netherlands: no new official figures are available since 1 Oct 2007,
when there were 5051 infected holdings and additional 405 suspect holdings.
A map, updated on 8 Oct 2007, is available on the website of the Dutch
ministry at

As at 5:00 pm on 12 Oct 2007 there were 37 confirmed premises affected by
bluetongue. This figure will normally be updated once daily (Monday to
Friday). The cases of bluetongue remain within the Bluetongue Control Zone
and are located in a cluster in the Ipswich area, with further cases in
Essex and near Lowestoft.

FMD GB movement ban to lift outside risk area and new measures to relieve
pressure within the bluetongue zones
---------------------------------------------
Markets within the Bluetongue Control and Protection Zones will be
permitted from midnight Sun 14 Oct 2007. The movement of susceptible
animals from within the Control and Protection Zones to approved
slaughterhouses outside the Bluetongue Zones will also be permitted
from this time. Conditions apply and markets within the FMD Risk Area
will remain closed.

From Monday [15 Oct 2007], slaughterhouses outside the Bluetongue Zones
will be able to apply to the Meat Hygiene Service to be approved to take
usceptible animals for slaughter from within the Control and Protection
Zones, provided they can fulfil specified criteria. Movements of
susceptible animals to approved slaughterhouses will also be subject to
certain conditions, to minimise the risk of disease spread. These changes,
as with all aspects of disease control measures, have been discussed and
developed with the Core Group of industry stakeholders.

[The following description of a BTV-8 outbreak in a goat flock in the
Netherlands, initially published beginning September 2007, is posted here
in view of its significance, since clinical bluetongue is generally
regarded to be rather exceptional in goats. - Mod.AS]

Date: Tue 4 Sep 2007

<http://www.agd.nl/Algemeen/Artikel/Eerste-geitenbedrijf-met-bluetongue.htm>

The 1st bluetongue-affected goat farm is situated in Someren; this has been
published by CIDC, the Central Institute for Animal Disease Control,
Lelystad. The farm includes 600 dairy goats and 5 cows. According to CIDC,
the cows are still healthy.

In a group of more than 100 goats, 10 have been found to be seriously sick.
Up to now, it was not known if goats, infected with BTV-8, would develop a
clinical disease, says CIDC.

According to the animal-disease service [GD], the main clinical sign
observed in the goats, was high fever (up to 42 deg C / 107.6 deg F).
Several of the goats had slightly swollen lips and small subcutaneous
hemorrhages on the udders. The high-yield goats with elevated temperature
had a sharp drop in their milk production.

According to CIDC, there was only one earlier recording in the Netherlands
of a BT positive-tested goat, in February this year (2007). However, the
goat's PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test was negative; the goat did not
show clinical signs.

Bluetongue outbreak detected in Denmark - EU
--------------------------------------------
An outbreak of the bluetongue virus has been reported in Denmark in a sheep
herd near Sakskobing on the island of Lolland, south of Zealand, the
European Commission said on Saturday. [See map at
<http://www.multimap.com/maps/?&t=l&map=54.80062,11.63575|14|4&loc=DK:54.80062:11.63575:14#t=l&map=54.80062,11.63575|6|4&loc=DK:54.80062:11.63575:14>.

- Mod.AS]

Clinical symptoms of bluetongue were identified in a sheep that died less
than 48 hours after signs of the virus were observed, the EU executive said
in a statement.

The announcement makes Denmark the latest north European country to report an
outbreak of the disease.

Bluetongue is an insectborne viral disease that affects domestic and wild
ruminants. It does not affect humans and there is no risk of the disease
being contracted or spread through meat or milk.

It has spread with alarming speed across Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, France and Britain.

The Danish authorities were taking necessary measures, including demarcation of
an amended restricted zone, the Commission said.

["Restriction zones" have been declared, so far, in 3 countries which
neighbor BTV-8 affected countries: Denmark, Switzerland, and the Czech
republic. Two additional countries, Austria and Poland, have restriction
just touching their borders; see map at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/BlueTongue_RestrictedZones.jpg>.

Of the said countries, Denmark has now detected its 1st case, within an
area already included in the restriction zone. Similar development should
not surprise in the other mentioned countries, demonstrating the amazing
rapid spread of the BTV-8 virus in North-West Europe, spreading in all
directions by means of a vector (yet to be thoroughly studied) which
demonstrates formidable efficiency.

Laboratory confirmation of the Danish outbreak is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
