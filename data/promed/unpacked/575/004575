Federal health officials say 6 Canadians have been stricken by a strain of _E. coli_ that has a similar genetic fingerprint to romaine lettuce from the US southwest that has already sickened 149 people in 29 states.

The Public Health Agency of Canada says 2 of the 6 Canadians reported travelling to the USA before falling ill due to _E. coli_ O157, 3 became infected in Canada and the remaining case is under investigation. The 6 Canadian illnesses were reported between late March and mid-April [2018] in 4 provinces -- 1 each in British Columbia and Alberta and 2 each in Saskatchewan and Ontario. One Canadian was hospitalized and no deaths have been reported in Canada.

Two Canadians reported travelling to the USA before getting sick and eating romaine lettuce while they were there. The others ate romaine lettuce at home, or in prepared salads purchased at grocery stores, restaurants and fast food chains, before their illnesses occurred. The agency says if it is determined that contaminated romaine lettuce is in the Canadian market, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency will recall the product as required.

The USA Food and Drug Administration says romaine lettuce from the Yuma growing region in Arizona and California is no longer being produced and distributed, so the potential for exposure to contaminated lettuce is reduced.

[The strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 appears to be the same as the outbreak strain in the USA. 4 of the 6 cases were acquired in Canada and 2 in the USA. As seen in the USA reports, the number of USA cases has continued to rise with a high percentage of cases requiring hospitalization, as well as a significant percentage developing hemolytic uremic syndrome. - Mod.LL
