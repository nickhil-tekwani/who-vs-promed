Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: On 6 Aug 2020, the owner notified the Department of Veterinary Services (DVS) State Office that 2 of his 5 horses were limping and that he suspected them to have soft soles. The owner also complained that his 2 limping horses were showing difficulty in breathing. However, during the visit, the difficulty in breathing was not observed by the veterinary officer. A week after the 1st visit (17 Aug 2020), the owner reported to the DVS that a 3rd horse was having fever and suffering from difficulty in breathing. The horse was treated with dexamethasone and Benacillin. Then, 3 days after the 2nd visit, the 4th horse was reported limping with a swollen hind leg. Blood samples were taken from the 4 affected horses and sent to the Veterinary Research Institute (VRI) in Ipoh for analysis. The RT-PCR showed that the 4 horses were positive for African horse sickness. Disease investigation was conducted on 31 Aug 2020, and a 2nd sampling for blood, nasal swabs and eye discharge was performed. The RT-PCR results from VRI showed all the 5 horses were positive for African horse sickness. Epidemiological investigation to determine the source of infection is ongoing.

Control measures:
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, screening, traceability, quarantine, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: Selective killing and disposal, zoning, disinfestation, control of vectors, vector surveillance

[Given the situation in Thailand, where 15 outbreaks of AHS subtype 1 have been reported since March 2020, it is not surprising that AHS has now been reported in Malaysia. It is, therefore, likely that the subtype in Malaysia will be the same one as that circulating in Thailand.

"AHS (due to AHS virus serotype 1) has been reported in Thailand in March 2020 for the 1st time, which represents the 1st incursion in Asia and poses a significant challenge to the equine industry and Veterinary Services at both national and regional scale." See updated information of the situation of AHS in Asia and the Pacific region at https://rr-asia.oie.int/en/projects/african-horse-sickness/.

Official reports from Thailand to the OIE are available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=33768.

Malaysia is the 2nd country in South-East Asia that is now affected with AHS. - Mod.CRD
