Swine fever hits northern Mozambique
------------------------------------
Mozambique is planning to cull thousands of pigs after cases of swine
fever were discovered in the northern province of Cabo Delgado, the
head of the provincial livestock department said on Wednesday [8 Sep
2004].

Coming on the heels of an outbreak of bovine tuberculosis threatening
20 000 cattle [a statement that has been officially contested -- see ProMED
20040829.2414. - Mod.JW], the epidemics are dealing a blow to Mozambique's
efforts to revive its livestock population that was wiped out in the 1976-
1992 civil war.

At least 1500 pigs have been infected and a further 13 000 were at risk, said
Joao Vaz from the livestock department. "Since the disease is highly
contagious and has no cure, the only viable solution is to cull the animals
affected and prohibit the movement of the swine from one village to another,"
Vaz said.

Vaz said the 1st case of swine fever was discovered a month ago.

[This report has been labeled "suspected" pending news of laboratory
confirmation. - Mod.JW]

[African swine fever is endemic in Mozambique. For detailed background see
commentary in ProMED post 20020105.3161.

The intended stamping out can be effective only with the cooperation of the
owners; this might require assuring them that reasonable compensation for the
obligatorily culled animals will be paid in a timely fashion. - Mod.AS]
