Comment on Needle Exchange Policy
-------------------------------
The response from the moderator expressing skepticism about the wisdom of providing needle exchange in a prison is not necessarily supported by published studies. They can indeed be feasible and effective. For example, see the following:

Abstract
-------
Journal publications and conference presentations on prison-based syringe exchange (PSE) programmes were identified by a comprehensive search of electronic databases. Experts involved with development and evaluation of current PSE programmes or policy were contacted for reports, documents and unpublished material. Spanish information on PSE was translated for this review.

We identified 14 papers specifically on PSE programmes in Switzerland (6 papers), Germany (4) and Spain (4). The 1st PSE programme started in 1992 in Switzerland. As of December 2000, 7 PSEs were operating in Switzerland, 7 in Germany and 5 in Spain. There have been 6 evaluations of prison syringe exchange programmes and all have been favourable. Reports of drug use decreased or remained stable over time. Reports of syringe sharing declined dramatically. No new cases of HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C transmission were reported. The evaluations found no reports of serious unintended negative events, such as initiation of injection or of the use of needles as weapons. Staff attitudes were generally positive but response rates to these surveys varied. Overall, this review indicated that prison syringe exchange programmes are feasible and do provide benefit in the reduction of risk behaviour and the transmission of blood-borne infection without any unintended negative consequences.

[ProMED-mail and the moderator thank Dr. J. Richard Gould for drawing attention to one of the several reports in the literature documenting the benefits and full or partial success of needle-exchange programmes in prisons. We hope the Australian proposal about to be implemented in Canberra will prove similarly beneficial. - Mod.CP]
