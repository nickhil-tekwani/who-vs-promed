Hong Kong: outbreak of hand, foot & mouth disease in preschool children
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A Hong Kong toddler was recently infected with a virus that killed dozens
of children in Malaysia and Taiwan several years ago, health officials said
on Fri 21 May 2004. The 21 month old boy had contracted enterovirus 71
infection, one of several viruses that can cause hand, foot and mouth
disease, said Health Department spokesman Jimmy Lee. This virus was blamed
for the deaths of 50 children in Taiwan in 1998, and 30 in Malaysia in 1997.
The boy has recovered, but officials were checking whether other children
-- including 16 of his schoolmates and 10 children at another nursery --
have contracted enterovirus 71 infection. All the children had symptoms of
hand, foot and mouth disease around 7 May to 18 May 2004. Although
laboratory tests showed that the 21 month old boy had the sometimes deadly
enterovirus 71, Lee said it was premature to say whether the others had the
same virus.
Symptoms usually include fever, mouth sores and rashes on the hands and
feet. The infectious disease isn't usually life-threatening, but can
potentially cause fatal inflammation of the heart muscles, spinal cord or
brain. Only 2 of the 27 children who showed symptoms of the disease in the
2 latest apparent outbreaks have required hospital treatment, and their
parents were advised to keep them away from school until they have
completely recovered, Lee said.
5 people in Hong Kong, including the 21 month old boy, were confirmed to be
infected with enterovirus 71 in 2004 but all have recovered, he said. Hand,
foot and mouth disease most commonly occurs in summer and early autumn. It
usually affects children and can be spread through direct contact with body
fluids.

[In March 2004 5 children from the kindergarten section of the Yew Chung
International School in Kowloon Tong were reported to have contracted hand,
foot & mouth disease. None of the children, all aged 4 years, developed
complications. A 2 year old boy who became ill on 10 Apr 2004 with fever
and rash over hands and mouth was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital on
14 Apr, discharged on 15 Apr, and recovered. Up to that time, cumulative
hand, foot & mouth disease cases in Hong Kong in 2004 were 3 imported and
no local cases. The total number of cases in previous years is the
following: 60 in 1998, 22 in 1999, 6 in 2000, 30 in 2001, 5 in 2002, 1 in
2003. - Mod.CP]
