Bermuda Health Department: Several Cases Of Mumps Reported
----------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health today [22 Aug 2011] confirmed that physicians
in the community have reported several cases of mumps, a vaccine
preventable disease, in August. Although a serious disease, mumps is
now very uncommon. There have been only a total of 8 confirmed cases
of mumps reported on the island over the past 10 years.

The Chief Medical Officer Dr. John Cann expressed concern over the
number of reported cases this year, in light of our high immunization
coverage rates. He noted that mumps is highly communicable and it only
takes a few unvaccinated individuals to initiate transmission.

Mumps is usually a mild viral disease characterized by mild fever,
headache, muscle ache and swelling of the parotid salivary glands
(located in the area between the neck and jaw, below the ears).
Serious side effects of mumps are more common among adults than
children. The disease is spread by contact with an infected person,
through coughing and sneezing.

Mumps vaccine [contained in MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) combined
vaccine] can prevent this disease. The vaccine given to children on a
2-dose schedule prevents almost all cases of mumps [But see:
ProMED-mail post 'Mumps - Czech Republic: (SK) supplementary
vaccination? 20110822.2553 - Mod.CP]. The MMR vaccine was introduced
for general use in Bermuda in 1983 as part of Bermuda's childhood
immunization programme. The majority of children have been fully
immunized by the age of 6 years. MMR is given at 15 months and a
booster is given between the ages of 4 to 6 years.

The Department of Health recommends that parents check their child's
immunization record to see if he or she has had the mumps or MMR
vaccine. If your child has not been vaccinated and is 15 months of age
or older, contact your pediatrician or family physician to have your
child vaccinated as soon as possible.

In addition, the department recommends that parents, who suspect that
their child has mumps, contact their physician for diagnosis and
treatment Public Health Nurses will contact parents of children who
may have been exposed to individuals with mumps to ascertain their
immunization status and help determine whether they are protected. The
Health Department also said that children with suspected mumps should
be excluded from school/day care for at least 9 days after the swollen
glands 1st appeared.

[It may be that MMR vaccine coverage in Bermuda in recent years has
been less than optimal. It is not stated whether the mumps cases are
unvaccinated individuals. However it is now well established that the
mumps component of the triple MMR vaccine is less protective than the
other 2 components, and a small proportion of vaccinated individuals
may still be at risk of infection.
