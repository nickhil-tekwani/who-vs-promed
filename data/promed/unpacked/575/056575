"Outbreaks of _E. coli_ [infection related to beef generally are
linked to the meat not being cooked thoroughly to at least 145
degrees, which would kill the bacteria, or were not held at a
sufficient temperature before served."
Taken from the posting (04) above, if this is the case, then aren't
the big recalls (Hudson Foods, et.al.) largely a waste? The problem
can be solved by adequate cooking. Why, instead of million pound
recalls, don't we implement regular sampling of ground beef and cull
the batches with positive contamination?
Or, as I deeply suspect, there are numerous batches or lots of
ground beef that are contaminated by _E. coli_ H7:0157 (or
relatives) that pass to consumers and cause mild, subclinical
cases, or no symptoms at all. Testing would likely reveal a much
higher level of contamination than that indicated by reported cases
of toxigenic _E. coli_.

[Ground beef production has been explained to me as follows. A
single infected carcass can get into the grinder and be mixed with
many others to contaminate literally tons of beef. Sampling of the
output is done at regular intervals, but testing is not done on the
premises, it is contracted out. When they get the results back &
find that a sample was contaminated, they don't usually recall the
lot, hoping that it will be sufficiently diluted not to cause severe
illness. But they do trace the supplier of the carcasses that went
into the lot, and stop buying from that source to avoid future
problems. A more effective system would increase the cost of the
product - Mod.JW
