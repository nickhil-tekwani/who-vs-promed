[The new 86 outbreaks are in the provinces Shanxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi and Yunnan. Most of the new outbreaks are in China's southern province Yunnan, which borders Viet Nam, Laos and Myanmar.

PPR seems to continue its rapid spread within China's susceptible sheep and goat populations (respectively, 143 680 000 and 141 361 000 head). The total number of PPR outbreaks since the start (on 5 Dec 2013) of the current epizootic in China has now sharply risen to 236; an interactive map showing all of them is available at http://tinyurl.com/oqx8okm. Is this a real physical spread of the virus or rather a reflection of intensified surveillance?

Information on the number of animals vaccinated in response to the outbreak in each of the affected provinces will be welcomed. Is preventive vaccination being applied as well? In case affirmative, in which of China's provinces and which vaccine is being applied? PPR is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
