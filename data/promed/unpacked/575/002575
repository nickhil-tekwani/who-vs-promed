Millions of dollars in the citrus industry in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia, and Venezuela have been lost because of citrus leprosis. Upon the detection of an outbreak in the state of Veracruz [Mexico], it is estimated that the disease is threatening around 40 000 hectares [98 842 acres] of citrus.

SAGARPA [Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries & Food] said that due to the high risk of infection, operations are being implemented at health inspection booths. Mobile shops and food markets will be subjected to monitoring in order to seize oranges, tangerines, grapefruits, and limes that have been affected by the plague.

They announced that there would be severe economic sanctions for traders who sell goods affected by the "citrus leprosis."

[Citrus leprosis is a devastating disease caused by _Citrus leprosis virus_ (CiLV; only member of genus _Cilevirus_, not assigned to a family or order) So far, it has only been reported from the Americas where it appears to be spreading, and it has been placed on the A1 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). Symptoms may include lesions on fruits, leaves, and twigs, premature leaf and fruit drop, defoliation, severe necrosis of new shoots, dieback of branches, bark scaling, as well as reduction of the canopy leading to serious tree decline and significant yield losses. CiLV only affects _Citrus_ species, and primarily sweet orange varieties (_C. sinensis_) are susceptible. Other species and hybrids have variable levels of resistance and some may not show symptoms serving as latent virus reservoirs.

Two forms of CiLV exist, one occurring in the cytoplasm, the other in the nucleus of infected host cells. Cytoplasmic CiLV (CiLV-C) has been shown to be the prevalent type in orchards. Both types are spread by the flat mite (or false spider mite, _Brevipalpus phoenicis_) and other related mite species. Unlike many other plant viruses, CiLV does not become systemic, which means each lesion represents a feeding puncture of an infected vector. Infectious mites may be spread with plant material such as budwood or rooted plantlets, and the leprosis risk is particularly high for areas where vector species are already present.

Disease management may include cultural methods to reduce virus and vector reservoirs, but mainly relies on controlling the mites. Most currently available miticides are effective and are applied once the vector reaches economic thresholds. Biological control by mite predators is being used occasionally. Disease levels often increase when crop prices fall due to farmers saving costs by reducing chemicals. Crop varieties with increased levels of resistance are available, but none of the commercial sweet orange varieties are resistant to leprosis.
