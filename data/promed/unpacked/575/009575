Fruit growers in Chitral district are facing damage of their pomegranate orchards from a mysterious disease. Growers are very much concerned. Due to [the] disease, the production of pomegranate is decreasing inflicting loss, besides affecting its taste. The disease causes early spurting of the fruit before its maturity, blighting of the fruit [and] weakening of trees.

[Growers] complained that agriculture department officials are not showing any concern to give some advice or visit the area to diagnose the disease. The growers have requested officials, including [the] Agriculture Minister, to take notice of the situation and save [their] pomegranates from destruction.

[The intended meaning of the term "early spurting" in the report above is unclear. Premature germination of pomegranate seeds as a result of external factors has been reported, but it has not been attributed to any kind of disease.

In the region, a number of fungal leaf blights are known to affect the crop. The bacterial oily spot (also called bacterial blight, black spot) caused by _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ (Xa) pv. _punicae_ is rife. It leads to blighting of leaves and sometimes also fruit and may be the disease referred to above. Oily spot can cause up to 90 per cent crop loss and is considered an epidemic and a threat to the industry in parts of India, with up to 85 per cent incidence in some areas (for example, see ProMED-mail posts 20140430.2439412 and 20150730.3546876).

The problems above may also be a combination of pathogen(s), pests and/or external factors. Potential high levels of pest activity may provide entry wounds for many pathogens and adverse environmental conditions or poor nutrition can weaken the host. In any case, reliable (where possible, molecular) diagnosis of the causes and/or pathogen(s) associated is essential before any management strategies can be designed.
