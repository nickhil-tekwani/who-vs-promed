Ohio has revoked the milk-producing license of a
western Ohio dairy farmer whose farm sold raw
milk, the agriculture department said. Farmers
in Ohio cannot sell raw milk for human
consumption, although they can drink the
unpasteurized milk from their own cows.
[A] farm in Darke County also did not properly
label its product and processed milk without a
license to do so, the Ohio Department of Agriculture said.
Agriculture officials said they began
investigating after a 63-year-old man and a
4-year-old boy who drank raw milk from the farm became ill.
[The owner of the implicated farm and her
husband], said the state had not informed them
that the license was revoked, although the
agriculture department said it notified their
attorney Thu, 28 Sep 2006. The couple plans to
appeal in Darke County Common Pleas
Court. Losing the license means the couple
cannot sell milk to a processor and would end their dairy business.
The couple operated a herd-share program that
allowed people to pay $50 for a share in a cow,
plus $6 a gallon for the milk, instead of selling
the milk directly. They argued it was not illegal
because those who got the milk owned part of the
cow. But the state's hearing officer said the
herd-share agreement was a thinly veiled attempt
to shield [the owner of the farm] from liability for selling milk illegally.
Hundreds of people have protested the state's
crackdown on those who sell raw milk, for which
customers are willing to pay as much as $12 a gallon.
Supporters of raw milk say it's full of vitamins
and does not bother those who are lactose
intolerant. Health officials warn milk that
hasn't been pasteurized to kill _E. coli_ and
other bacteria could make drinkers sick.

[The illnesses linked to unpasteurized milk in
this posting are not stated. Among possibilities include:
Zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_,
_Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_,
_Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_,
_Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species,
Coxiella burnetii, and _E. coli_ O157:H7.
Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus
pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium
diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ species, _Salmonella_
Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B,
enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A.
Other diseases that can be related to
unpasteurized milk are highlighted in these
paragraphs extracted from Leedom JM: Milk and
Infectious Diseases in Humans. Clin Infect Dis
2006;43: 610-615 with the citations renumbered to
be consecutive starting from 1:
"In 1996 and 1998, there were 2 episodes
involving rabid cows that occurred in
Massachusetts (1). Milk from rabid cows can
contain rabies virus, and transmission via
unpasteurized milk is theoretically possible.
Temperatures reached during pasteurization kill
the virus. 80 persons consumed unpasteurized milk
that was collected from the 2 cows, and 9 more
had contact with saliva from the cows. All 89
persons received postexposure rabies prophylaxis,
and no human cases of rabies eventuated. A
similar report in Oklahoma of possible rabies
exposure associated with the consumption of raw
milk or cream from a rabid cow was circulated in 2006 (2).
Tickborne encephalitis, a zoonotic arbovirus
infection usually transmitted to humans by the
bite of an _Ixodes persulcutus_ or _Ixodes
ricinis_ tick, is endemic to Central Europe,
Eastern Europe, and Russia (3). However, the
virus can be found in the milk of cows and goats
with tickborne encephalitis and was reported to
be transmissible to humans by the consumption of
unpasteurized milk (4). A case-control study
failed to confirm oral transmission (5).
A diarrhea syndrome (later named Brainerd
diarrhea) occurred among 122 residents of
Brainerd, Minnesota, during the period Dec
1983-Jul 1984 (6). It was characterized by acute
onset, marked urgency, lack of systemic symptoms,
failure to respond to conventional antimicrobial
agents, and a long median duration of illness
(median duration, 16.5 months). The syndrome was
linked to consumption of raw milk from a single
dairy (6). No etiologic agent was ever isolated.
The outbreak of Brainerd diarrhea stopped when
all of the dairy's output was diverted and
pasteurized (6, MT Osterholm, personal communication).
Subsequent outbreaks in Illinois and Texas were
not directly associated with milk, although
cattle had been in the vicinity of an Illinois
well that had its water implicated as a vehicle
of transmission (7). Another outbreak of
Brainerd-like diarrhea, although not associated
with raw milk, affected 58 (15 percent) of 394
passengers aboard a cruise ship visiting the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador (8).
