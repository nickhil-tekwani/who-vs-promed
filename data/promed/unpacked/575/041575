The Kenyan government has refuted reports of an outbreak of rinderpest disease in the country as well as a threat from neighboring Tanzania. Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries cabinet secretary Willy Bett said Kenya has an active and passive surveillance program that ensures that there is no re-emergence of rinderpest in the country, while keeping a high level of alertness. "This surveillance program also ensures that other important trans-boundary animal diseases are controlled to safeguard our livestock herds and trade," Bett said in a statement issued in Nairobi.

The local media had reported that there was a possible outbreak of rinderpest disease, which affects livestock, in Kenya. The reports said that the disease had already killed thousands of livestock in neighboring Tanzania, with the government on high alert over a possible occurrence in Kenya.

However, Bett said that rinderpest -- a devastating contagious animal disease, also known as cattle plague, that affects cloven hoofed animals, mainly cattle and buffaloes -- was successfully eradicated the world over in 2011. Kenya had earlier eradicated the disease in 2009, and a certificate was issued to that effect by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

Bett said that an outbreak of anthrax in wild animals in Tanzania had elicited rumors to the effect that it was an outbreak of rinderpest. The rumor has attracted a lot of media attention in Kenya. "We, however, have official confirmation from the veterinary authorities in Tanzania that the outbreak was indeed anthrax and not rinderpest," Bett said.

Rinderpest is one of the world's deadliest livestock diseases, capable of clearing 90 per cent of livestock in just 10-15 days. The disease's symptoms in cattle, goats and sheep [see comment] include fever, erosive lesions in the mouth, discharge from the nose and eyes, profuse diarrhea, and dehydration, often leading to death.

The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) declared the world free from rinderpest [in 2011: see references below. - Mod.SH], but it is still found in small outbreaks in Africa.

[The above rumor should be definitively excluded at the earliest, preferably involving FAO's experts.

Rinderpest is predominantly a disease in bovines. It is (or rather WAS) rare in small ruminants. The parallel disease in sheep and goats is peste des petits ruminants, which is subject to initial steps towards global control. - Mod.AS
