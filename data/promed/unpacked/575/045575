Tests confirm Abbottabad doctor died of CCHF
--------------------------------------------
The mysterious death of a resident medical officer (RMO) at the Ayub
Teaching Hospital (ATH), has been attributed to Crimean- Crimean
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), hospital management said on Friday (1 Oct
2010) [This was 1st described in the ProMED-mail post "Undiagnosed
fatal illness - Pakistan: (NW) 20100927.3505"].

Medical Superintendent of the hospital Dr Iftikhar told The News that
the laboratory reports from the National Institute of Health (NIH) had
confirmed the death of the doctor was due to CCHF virus infection.
CCHF is a viral disease that occurs primarily in animals but humans
are also susceptible to it. The disease is indigenous to many African,
European and Asian countries. Being a tick-borne disease, the majority
of the people who contract the virus are involved in the livestock
industry.

The deceased doctor caught fever and died after spending a night in
Bisham, Shangla district, where he had gone to perform duties at the
health facility established for people affected by floods. He was
treated at the ATH but could not survive.

The younger brother of the deceased doctor has been showing the same
symptoms for the past few days with intermittent [increased]
temperature and low platelet [counts]. Sources said the ATH
administration had no infectious diseases specialist and had decided
to refer the patient to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in
Islamabad.

After the confirmation of death of the doctor due to to CCHF virus
infection, the hospital administration sent blood samples of his
relatives and hospital staff to the laboratories in Islamabad. It also
decided to provide free medical treatment to all the relatives of the
deceased doctor. A special ward has been set up at the Dental Block
where all patients suspected of having the disease will be kept in
isolation. Another ICU unit will also be established in the hospital
to provide medical treatment for dengue, bird flu and CCHF patients.
It is worth mentioning here that there is no virologist or infectious
disease specialist in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [province].

The Executive District Officer (Health) in Mansehra, Dr Javed Tanoli,
told reporters that 4 more patients suspected to be suffering from
CCHF had been hospitalised. Dr Tanoli said the district health
department was taking protective measures in Mansehra. He said the
samples of the 4 suspected CCHF patients admitted to the King Abdullah
Teaching Hospital, Mansehra, were also sent to NIH for tests and
confirmation of the infection. Dr Tanoli said after the death of the
hospital doctor, the district health department was adopting
precautionary steps in accordance with the World Health Organisation
guidelines.

[This press report confirms that that the fatal undiagnosed illness
suffered by a resident physician at the Ayub Teaching Hospital (ATH)
in Abbottabad, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (previously North-West Frontier
Province) was in fact Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever as suggested as
a possibility in the original ProMED-mail report. A verdict on other
cases at the ATH is awaited. In view of the number of new suspected
cases accumulating and the nosocomial cases in Rawlpindi it may be
that the infection is spreading from person to person rather than from
infected livestock or via the tick vector.

[For readers who are wondering what a disease named Congo-Crimean
hemorrhagic fever is doing in Pakistan, thereby hangs a tale. The
disease was first identified as the cause of an epidemic in the
Crimean peninsula in the Black Sea in the former USSR. Years later,
the virus was isolated from the blood of a febrile patient in the
former Belgian Congo by a Belgian doctor, and sent to the regional
reference lab, which was the East African Virus Research Institute
(EAVRI) in the British colony of Uganda (now the Uganda VRI). There
it was isolated by staff and sent by me to the world reference lab at
the Rockefeller Foundation Virus Laboratory in New York, where it was
found to be new. I asked the Belgian what he would like to name it,
and he said Congo virus, which is the name I published it under.
Later, the Soviets succeeded in isolating the virus from their own
patients, and were surprised to find it was Congo virus. They decided
this would never do, hence the current name. It has since been found
to be carried by migrating birds and their ticks all over their
migration routes in much of the Old World. - Mod.JW]
