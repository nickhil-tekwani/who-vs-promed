13 rowers from the approximately 40-member USA contingent developed gastroenteritis during the World Junior Rowing Championships, a preliminary for next summer's [2016] Olympics. The group's physician stated that she thought it had been because of pollution within the river where competition occurred.

"We took a number of additional measures (in addition to pre-travel vaccines/medications), such as protecting water bottles from exposure to the water of the lagoon, covering all open scratches or sores, and washing with antiseptic soap after every session," said Peter Cookson.

The USA team arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 28 Jul 2015, and the occurrence of the illnesses was spread out over the course of their almost 2 weeks in Brazil.

US Rowing, which supervises the game in the USA, said it is exploring what sickened the competitors, who ranged in age from 16-19. While 13 rowers on the US team did suffer stomach illness, the Australians were relatively unscathed, with only 3 of 23 affected. But most athletes say they are still being told the venues are safe by officials in individual sports, so there is no reason not to stick to the program.

Doug Hiller, medical officer for the global Triathlon Union said he was giving no special recommendations to athletes about Rio water quality. Nevertheless, the Rio water testing company doesn't possess even the trained employees or the equipment to carry out viral screening of water, based on virologists that are nearby. The agency confirmed it only does bacterial testing, since that is all Brazilian law, like that of most nations including the USA, demands. Assuming the sanitation protocol was followed, we would not expect them to become ill.

Pollution worries have also been raised over the state of Guanabara Bay, the sheltered water outside Rio where the Olympic sailing and windsurfing events will take place. "We will prepare for it, but it's a pretty irresponsible decision that has been made," Australia head coach Jacco Verhaeren told The Associated Press.
