A week after the UT Health Department and the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation ruled out contamination of water supplied in Ram Darbar here, a resident of the area tested positive for cholera today, 26 Dec 2014. The sample of water being supplied to the patient's house has now been sent for a cross-analysis to a public sector laboratory in Kolkata, said the nodal officer for the National Vector-Borne Disease-Control Programme, Chandigarh, Dr Anil Garg.

Of the over 200 residents who reported at the local dispensary and the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, with symptoms of diarrhea during the past month [December 2014], 4 were suspected to be suffering from cholera. The stool samples of 3 patients were found negative for cholera, while one tested positive.

The patient is at present admitted to the GMCH. A 3 year old boy from Ram Darbar Colony had died on 16 Dec 2014, reportedly due to diarrhea. However, the MC had ruled out contamination of water after testing water samples of the morning and evening supply for 3 consecutive days on 14, 15 and 16 Dec 2014. Following the boy's death, the UT Health Department had collected samples of water from the area and sent these for examination to a lab in Mani Majra. The samples were declared fit for consumption. The present confirmation of cholera has led to a confusion among officials over contrasting water sample reports. They have now sent a water sample from the patient's house for cross-checking.

The children confirmed with cholera are from a family in Athirambuzha. The disease was confirmed following tests conducted. The health department noticed the spread of cholera through contaminated water. The disease spreads through water and is spread by bacteria, _Vibrio cholerae_. Disease enters the body through water and food obtained from unhygienic places.

Up to 10 people are confirmed dead in east Kwaio, Malaita as a result of a diarrhea outbreak in the area since November 2014. They include 7 children and 3 adults. Enoch Idui, who comes from the area, said he witnessed a 9 month old child who died from diarrhea. He said the nurse in charge at Namolaelae clinic told him the outbreak was due to unhygienic practices by people living in the area.

"People should practice better hygiene other than living carelessly," Mr Idui said. He said in the past weeks, the clinic was packed with diarrhea affected patients.

However, nurse in-charge of the infection control department at Kilu'ufi Hospital Nixon Olofisau said the diarrhea incidents were not an outbreak but a normal occurrence. "From the reports I get, it was not an outbreak," Mr Olofisau said.

The mortality rate in the Otash camp for the displaced in Nyala locality, South Darfur has risen in the past 2 months, owing to the spread of a disease causing high fever, vomiting, and diarrhea.

"In particular, children suffer from the disease," a resident of the camp reported to Radio Dabanga. "Many died during the past 2 months, as the staff of the camp's health centre are unable to treat all the patients."

He appealed to the health authorities in South Darfur state to accelerate the provision of medicines, and increase the number of health centres in the camp.
