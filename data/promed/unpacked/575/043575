Dangerous Bacteria Found In Frozen Fish From Viet Nam
-----------------------------------------------------
A customer became acutely ill after eating a filet of fish, bought at
a Rema 1000 store in Haugesund. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority
[NSA] found dangerous bacteria and toxins from bacteria in frozen
fish from the shop.

When the customer became acutely ill for the 2nd time after eating
fish filet of the same type, the Norwegian Safety Authority was
alerted. The NSA revealed that the fish from Viet Nam contained toxin
from staphylococci bacteria, along with cholera vibrios which can
cause cholera. The customer had bought frozen filets of the Asian
fish type, pangasius, in a Rema 1000-store in Haugesund. The symptoms
suggest that the person was infected with staphylococcal toxin.

The progression of the illness with a [staphylococcal] infection is
very unpleasant [the actual process of staphylococcal food poisoning
is related to ingestion of preformed toxin produced by the
staphylococci during their multiplication in contaminated food, and
not related to human infections with the staphylococcal organisms. -
Mod.MPP]. One is knocked out by intense vomiting and diarrhoea, which
in turn leads to headaches and exhaustion. Concerning cholera vibrios,
you need to get a lot in you before you get cholera," says Marit L.
Manhenke, functioning overseer at the NSA's regional office in
Rogaland and Agder.

According to the NSA, the sickness occurs a few hours after infection
with the staphylococcal toxin. The duration of the illness varies from
between one and 8 hours. The bacteria are not deadly.

The pangasius filets have been sold in Rema 1000 shops in the whole
country, as well as Coop Obs stores at Sotra, Jessheim and
Lillestrom. Polar Seafood in Moss, which imports the filets from Viet
Nam, has initiated the withdrawal and has halted sales of the fish
filets from the consignment in question.

The consignment was produced 28 and 29 Nov 2007. Customers
who have products from the consignment in question can have the cost
refunded on returning the product to the shop in its frozen
condition. The withdrawn consignment may have been sold in Norwegian
shops since January/February this year [2008], but only one person so
far is know to have become sick from the fish toxin.

"There can be some gloomy figures here. The sickness is short-lived
and not everyone would immediately link diarrhoea and vomiting with
food poisoning," says overseer Marit L. Manhenke of NSA.

[While the occurrence of a single case of staphylococcal food
poisoning associated with an imported product does not on face value
appear to be a major event, the finding of both staphylococcal toxin
and _Vibrio cholerae_ organisms in samples of fish filets imported
from Viet Nam does not bode well for the Viet Nam fish export
industry. The finding of both agents (the toxin and the bacteria) in
the exported product suggests that quality control measures at the
packing plant were deficient, allowing for contaminated products to
be shipped internationally.

As a reminder, there have been 3 "waves" of cholera outbreaks in Viet
Nam since late 2007:

* the 1st "wave" of outbreaks occurred during a 6-7 week period from
late October to mid-December 2007,
*the 2nd wave of outbreaks was in March/April 2008, and
*the 3rd "wave" of outbreaks began in mid-June 2008 and is continuing
through the present, as can be seen in prior PRO/MBDS postings listed
below.

The finding of _Vibrio cholerae_ organisms in the frozen fish filets
is a very disconcerting finding, as cholera-free countries may react
by closing down their import market from cholera infected countries to
prevent importation of _Vibrio cholerae_ through the food supply.

More information on investigations into this incident both in Norway
as well as in Viet Nam would be greatly appreciated. It would also be
of interest to learn if other countries have identified cases of food
poisoning associated with this product.
