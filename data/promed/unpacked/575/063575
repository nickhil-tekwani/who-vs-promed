More than 40 people have been tested positive for Congo fever that resulted in the death of 4 people in western Herat province since late March, local health officials said [Mon 25 Jun 2018].

A total of 41 Congo fever cases were recorded in Herat since [21 Mar 2018]. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by infection with a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) in the family _Bunyaviridae_. The disease was first characterized in Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever.

The onset of CCHF is sudden, with initial signs and symptoms including headache, high fever, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain, and vomiting. Red eyes, a flushed face, a red throat, and petechiae (red spots) on the palate are common.

Health officials in Herat expressed concern over the increasing CCHF cases in the province. Mohammad Naim Dawlati, head of the Herat Zonal Hospital, addressed a conference to spread awareness about CCHF and expressed concern about increasing positive cases.

He linked the increase in CCHF cases to infected animals being transported to Afghanistan from Iran and Turkmenistan. He said 47 percent of the patients were women and the main cause was not observing sanitary in cooking livestock meat. A total of 4 people infected with the disease died in the province since the beginning of this solar year [2018] while 41 others are suffering, he said. Dawlati said 80 people were tested positive for Congo virus last year [2017] when 17 patients died.

Also present at the press conference was Ahmad Amir Nijad, head of Emergency Response in the western zone. He said the number of infected people in Heart was higher compared to other provinces. "In total 115 cases have been recorded across Afghanistan and 41 of them were recorded in Herat, this shows more than 40 percent of the cases, he said.

Nisar Ahmad, one of the patients, said:"I slaughtered a sheep and its blood contacted my hands and feet, I fell ill after that and went to hospital, now I have somehow improved."

Khalil Ahmad Waez, animal health in charge in agriculture department of Herat, said butchers should use gloves and protective kit such as eye glasses, masks and boots while slaughtering animals. He said slaughtered animals should not be touched and left for up to 2 hours. Animals should be slaughtered away from residential areas and their hide kept in a plastic bag.

[The above report cites four additional cases since the last Promed post dated 23 Jun 2018 [Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Afghanistan: (HR) 20180622.5870770], and these case numbers are over a 3 month period in Herat region. The nearly equal distribution of cases in women is also a cause for concern, indicating that the prevalent risk practices must be identified and appropriate public communication/awareness strategy must be devised. - Mod.UBA
