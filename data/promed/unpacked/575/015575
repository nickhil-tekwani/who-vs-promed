[The PRRS outbreak statistics provided by Viet Nam (31 outbreaks) are
reminiscent of those provided by China in its notification on PRRS of
9 May 2007 (one PRRS outbreak, Guandong; see 20070512.1517):
Country/No. outbreaks/ App morb rate/ App mort rate/ App case fatality rate
Viet Nam/ 31 / 58.48 percent/ 8.08 percent/ 13.82 percent
China/ 1 / 55.02 percent / 11.10 percent / 20.18 percent
As expressed in previous postings on the emerging porcine epizootic
in Viet Nam and China, it is desirable that PRRS virus isolates from
Viet Nam and China will be subjected to phylogenetic studies and
compared to each other, preferably by international reference
laboratories, which will also test samples from both countries to
exclude other pathogens.
Viet Nam's PRRS reporting frequency is exemplary. - Mod.AS].
