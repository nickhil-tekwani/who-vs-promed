California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Director and State Health Officer Dr Ron Chapman today, 31 Dec 2013, warned people not to eat cashew cheese products manufactured by The Cultured Kitchen because they may be contaminated with _Salmonella_. 15 cases of illnesses have been reported in the Western USA, with 12 of the cases occurring in California. 3 patients have been hospitalized and no deaths have been reported.

The Cultured Kitchen of West Sacramento, California has initiated a voluntary recall of all flavors of its cashew cheese products with expiration dates on or before 19 Apr 2014, due to the risk of contamination. The products were sold in natural food stores throughout Northern California and Northern Nevada, and at farmers markets in Sacramento County.

The cashew cheese products were sold in 8-ounce plastic containers in the following flavors: Herb, smoked cheddar, pepper jack, habanero cilantro lime, basil pesto and white cheddar. Photos of the recalled product labels are on the CDPH website (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/pubsforms/Documents/fdbFrCUL1a.pdf).

While the cashew cheese products are no longer being sold at retail facilities, CDPH is concerned that consumers may still have some of these products in their homes. Consumers in possession of these recalled products should discard them or return them to the place of purchase for a refund.

[The serotype or serotypes of _Salmonella enterica_ involved in this outbreak is not reported. Salmonellosis has continued to be an important cause of foodborne illness, which can be related to unpasteurized dairy products or undercooked meat or poultry.

This week, as reported in Meat and Poultry (http://www.meatpoultry.com/articles/news_home/New_Technology/2013/12/FDA_approves_new_food-processi.aspx?ID=%7B34E4DEF0-FE6F-4CAB-B178-912D0B628C48%7D&cck=1) brings up a quite old antibacterial methodology to assist in preventing salmonellosis:

"Micreos of The Netherlands announced the US Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration have approved Salmonelex as a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) food-processing aid against salmonellosis.

Salmonelex consists of natural phages that eliminate _Salmonella_, and the product is easy to apply, according to Micreos. It can be sprayed topically or added to chill tank water. Micreos expects that the product will soon be listed by the Organic Material Review Institute (OMRI) for use in organic foods."

"Research has shown that Salmonelex does not dissipate in the presence of protein, said Dirk de Meester, business development manager. Thus, the product enables processors to reduce the use of chemicals and reach _Salmonella_ in places where antimicrobial chemicals are ineffective, for example in follicles which close when exposed to cold water in a chiller."

Micreos confirmed that industrial scale projects with US poultry processors will start in January 2014.

"Now that the FDA and USDA have given the green light we can offer food processors a new and natural solution against _Salmonella_, including antibiotic resistant strains," said Mark Offerhaus, CEO of Micreos. "Salmonelex is seen as a very elegant solution as it targets only _Salmonella_ and has no other effect on the treated food product, neither in taste, nor texture. Following the successful launch of Listex against _Listeria_, we are now further expanding the 'green' arsenal of weapons against foodborne pathogens. Given the prevalence of _Salmonella_ in raw poultry, we expect poultry processors to be the 1st and largest users of Salmonelex."

Bacteriophage therapy has been used therapeutically especially outside the USA and Western Europe as reviewed in Sulakvelidze A, Alavidze Z, Morris, JG Jr: Bacteriophage therapy. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2001; 45(3): 649-59. - Mod.LL
