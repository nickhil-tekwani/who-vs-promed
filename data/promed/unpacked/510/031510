The Department of Public Health and Social Services confirmed yesterday [13 Nov 2013] that [the cause of] an ongoing outbreak of fever, rash, and joint pain in Yap, transmitted through mosquito bites has been identified as chikungunya virus. As of now, there is no medication to treat this virus, and there is no vaccine to prevent it, the press release states.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Epi-Aid team has been in Yap assisting with control measures.

Public Health said a travel situation awareness advisory is in place. It also wants the public to know that the same species of mosquito lives on Guam as well. It advises residents to minimize their risk of contracting the disease by using insect repellant, wearing long-sleeved shirts, and eliminating mosquito breeding sites, such as standing water.

[Previously Yap was the site of an outbreak of Zika fever, a mosquito (_Aedes aegypti_, and _Ae. africanus_) transmitted disease caused by a Zika virus, a flavivirus first isolated from humans and non-human primates in Africa, and subsequently in South East Asia in Malaysia and Indonesia. Traditionally, illness caused by Zika virus was termed "Zika fever." However fever has been an inconsistent feature of this Zika outbreak. The Yap Zika fever outbreak appeared to have started in April 2007 and to have gradually subsided. - Mod.TY

Now Yap has become the site of an outbreak of chikungunya fever, a viral disease also transmitted to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes. Chikungunya virus is a member of the genus _Alphavirus_, of the family _Togaviridae_. There is no specific treatment for chikungunya fever; care is based on alleviation of symptoms. Chikungunya fever is not usually fatal. Steps to prevent infection with chikungunya virus include use of insect repellent, protective clothing, and staying in areas with screens.

Chikungunya virus was first isolated from the blood of a febrile patient in Tanzania in 1953, and has since been cited as the cause of numerous human epidemics in many areas of Africa and Asia. Chikungunya virus is spread by the bite of the same species of mosquitoes as Zika virus. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on a person infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other humans when they bite. The _Ae. aegypti_ mosquito is the principal vector responsible for transmitting chikungunya virus to humans. _Ae. aegypti_ is a species of mosquito that breeds in household containers, is an aggressive biter during the day, and is attracted to humans for blood meals. _Ae. albopictus_ (the Asian tiger mosquito) has also played a role in transmission to humans.

Chikungunya virus causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and rash. The disease shares some clinical signs with dengue fever and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common. There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya fever.

Travellers should be made aware of the risks and should take appropriate precautions. For more information, see the WHO factsheet at http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs327/en/index.html). - Mod.CP
