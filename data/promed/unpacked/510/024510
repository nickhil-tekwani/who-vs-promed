[Inconsistencies in reporting have been the hallmark of this epidemic
so far and it appears as if they continue with this report. The
report indicates that the manifestation of the disease is clinical in
nature, yet the statistics reported here do not verify a single case,
nor is a specific morbidity or mortality rate confirmed in this
report. There is a positive ELISA test reported, but again it is
important to emphasize that no clinical cases are cited in this
report. It is all a bit confusing and we hope further reports will
clear these discrepancies up.

I would also like to direct readers to the commentary by Mod.AS, who
in turn cites Peter Roeder and Glyn Davies. Please see ProMED-mail
Rift Valley fever - Sudan (04) 20071110.3648.

These previous posting provide valuable background and perspective
with special emphasis on the timing of vaccination, the temporal
relationship between animal and human disease, the potential effects
of trade between Sudan and Egypt, as well as Sudan and other
countries in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East.

One final point, which is certainly worth considering is the excess
rainfall due to the climatic warming associated with the El Nino
Southern Oscillation pattern of weather and associated flooding.
Given the increasing worldwide frequency of warm temperatures,
associated floods, and subsequent outbreaks of RVF, it is important
we use our wits as one of ProMED-mail's great supporters, Dr. Joshua
Lederberg indicated. The full quote goes something like "pitted
against microbial genes, we have mainly our wits." In order to be
thoughtful and responsive in this situation, we must adopt and
implement the clever early warning systems already in place and find
effective ways of delivering "on time" vaccination in significant
numbers.
