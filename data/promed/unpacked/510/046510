Hand, foot and mouth disease in Sarawak
---------------------------------------
A total of 2271 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and 108
clusters, involving preschool facilities, schools and families were
reported as of 22 Oct 2011. Sarawak Health Department (Communicable
Diseases Control Section) principal assistant director Dr Noorzilawati
Sahak in revealing this yesterday [24 Oct 2011] however said there was
no outbreak in the state. "Yes, the situation is much better now
compared to the same period last year when 4692 cases were reported,"
she said. She also explained that when a nursery has 2 confirmed HFMD
cases from the same class, it would be advised to close down.

"The 5 districts with the highest number of cases are Bintulu with 651
cases, Kuching (415), Sarikei (150), Sibu (116) and Samarahan (102).
And districts with closure order (voluntary) include Bintulu, Sarikei,
Belaga, Sibu and Meradong," Dr Noorzilawati told The Borneo Post over
the phone when asked on HFMD situation in Sarawak. She stressed that
parents and carers must continue to remain vigilant even though there
was no outbreak in the state thus far. "It is important that they
continue to practice a high standard of hygiene and cleanliness,
including proper hand washing, and non-sharing of eating utensils,"
she advised.

Parents, she said, should isolate their children if they did not feel
well and get them immediate medical attention. She also revealed that
preschools, schools and organisations had been given guidelines on the
dos and don'ts pertaining to HFMD, and that preschools and schools
should inform the Health Department if they suspected a child was down
with HFMD. "The department personnel will carry out checks and
investigation at the nursery or school concerned. If the child is
confirmed to be down with HFMD, parents must ensure that he or she
stays away from school for at least a week. "It is important to
practise self-isolation under such circumstances to avoid the disease
transmitting to others," she advised.

Asked if schools would be closed if HFMD cases were reported there,
she explained that unlike preschools they needed to assess the
situation before taking the next course of action. When asked on
disinfection, Dr Noorzilawati pointed out that this would be done
either by the department or caretakers after the investigation. She
said, among other tings, it was mandatory for private clinics and
hospitals to notify HFMD cases. "Under the Prevention and Control of
Infectious Diseases Act and Regulations, they can be compounded
[prosecuted ?] for failing to report," Dr Noorzilawati pointed out.

[Sarawak is one of 2 Malaysian states on the island of Borneo. Sarawak
is situated on the north-west of the island. It is the largest state
in Malaysia followed by Sabah, the 2nd largest state located to the
North-East. The administrative capital is Kuching, which has a
population of 579 900. Major cities and towns include Miri (pop. 263
000), Sibu (pop. 254 000) and Bintulu (pop. 176 800). As of the last
census (2010), the state population was 2 420 009. The
HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Sarawak can be accessed at:

Though perhaps less than in the past, nonetheless this is a serious
outbreak. HFMD is a common illness of infants and children. It is
characterized by fever, sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters.
HFMD is caused mainly by enteroviruses. Among them, Human enterovirus
71 and coxsackievirus A16 are the the most common pathogens. HFMD is
usually spread by person-to-person contact. For the HFMD fact sheet,
see the CDC website at

Information on the identity of the virus or viruses concerned would be
welcome. - Mod.CP]
