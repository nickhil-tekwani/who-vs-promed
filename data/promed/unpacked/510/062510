Japan Reports Fourth Suspected Case of Mad Cow Disease
------------------------------------------------------
TOKYO: Japanese officials found a fourth suspected case of mad cow
disease Tuesday, increasing fears that the brain-wasting bovine illness
is spreading. A 40-month-old Holstein cow slaughtered at a meat
processing center in Tsuyama, 340 miles west of Tokyo, tested positive
in an initial examination, local government official Shinichi Hanaoka
said. Hanaoka said more reliable follow-up tests were planned at the
Kobe Quarantine office in western Japan and an agricultural and
veterinary university on Hokkaido. The results of the tests would be
known in a few days, he said.
Japan is the only country in Asia where herds have been affected by
the disease, which has ravaged Europe's beef industry. Officials here
have been scrambling to contain it since the first case was discovered
in September. The 3 previous cases have been confirmed.
