Wildlife biologists with the Virginia Department of Game and Inland
Fisheries are investigating reports of deer found dead or dying in
several counties across the Commonwealth. A viral disease known
as hemorrhagic disease (HD) is suspected as the cause.
Hemorrhagic disease is a common infectious disease of white-
tailed deer, and outbreaks occur annually in the Southeast.
Currently, some states across the southeast and Mid-Atlantic are
experiencing such outbreaks.
HD typically occurs in late summer and early fall. The disease
poses no threat to humans or domestic pets such as dogs and
cats. Biting flies, commonly known as biting gnats, transmit this viral
disease. Hemorrhagic disease cannot be spread by direct contact
between infected animals.
Deer that contract this disease often die rapidly. The number of
deer lost in a HD outbreak is variable. While it is impossible to
determine the exact number of deer affected by the current
outbreaks, some decrease in deer numbers in the affected areas
may be expected.
Not all deer contracting the disease will die. Surviving deer may be
emaciated or appear lame due to hoof damage. High fever due to
the virus may cause deer hooves to crack, peel or even slough off.
Hunters should not consume deer obviously sick when killed.
There is no vaccine or medication to combat this deer disease. HD
outbreaks will continue to occur until frost decreases the insects
carrying it. The best defense is to maintain healthy deer herds at a
population size suitable for the habitat. Department officials
suspect effects of prolonged drought may have contributed to
conditions making deer populations vulnerable to the disease. The
Department of Game and Inland Fisheries is continuing to monitor
this situation and will continue to provide technical assistance to
affected landowners.
If you have observed sick or dead deer in your area and suspect
HD may be the cause, please report it to a wildlife biologist at one
of the following Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries
regional offices:
Marion (540-783-4860)
Forest (804-525-7522)
Fredericksburg (540-899-4169)
Williamsburg (757-253-4180)
