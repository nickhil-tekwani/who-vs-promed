England: Norovirus Infection closes Hospital Wards in South West
---------------------------------------------------
Staff at the Royal Cornwall Hospital and the Royal Devon and Exeter
Hospital are battling a new outbreak of norovirus infection. Some 130
patients and staff at the Royal Cornwall in Treliske have succumbed
to vomiting and diarrhoea illness caused by this virus. 10 wards are
affected and 6 have been closed. Some surgical sessions have been
cancelled, and GPs are being asked to keep non-essential referrals to
a minimum. The virus has also led to new admissions being cancelled
in one ward at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in Exeter. The
hospital had only recently gotten back to normal after an outbreak
that affected 30 patients and 50 staff.
Andrew Telfer Brunton, the Director of the Public Health Laboratory
in Truro, said: "The illness comes at a time when we are also
receiving high numbers of emergency referrals. The number of reported
cases of norovirus infection around the UK has increased 10-fold in
the past year. Noroviruses are airborne viruses and spread rapidly in
any setting where large numbers of people are in close proximity.

[ProMED-mail also received the same report from John de Rivaz
<John@deRivaz.com>. Reports of viral gastroenteritis have declined
appreciably in recent weeks. This may herald a real reduction in the
occurrence of "winter vomiting disease", or alternatively merely
signal reporter fatigue. - Mod.CP]
