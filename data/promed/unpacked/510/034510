German officials say a suspected case of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has
been discovered on a pig farm in the north-west of the country. "There is a
high degree of suspicion," a government spokesman said after vets had
carried out checks.
Some 200 animals were slaughtered overnight at the farm in the state of
North Rhine-Westphalia which borders the Netherlands. The results of
preliminary tests are due on Wednesday. Germany has so far been spared the
contagious disease, and several suspected cases have proved negative.
This is the third suspected case of the highly contagious disease in
Germany. About 6000 sheep imported from Britain were slaughtered earlier on
2 farms.
Both those suspected cases turned out to be false alarms. Germany has so
far avoided the livestock disease, which has affected its neighbors France
and the Netherlands, as well as the Republic of Ireland and, far more
seriously, Britain.
