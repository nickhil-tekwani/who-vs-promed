An international NGO, Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) has launched a
vaccination campaign against yellow fever. The NGO launched the campaign in
collaboration with WHO and the Health Ministry in Lower Lofa County. The
campaign is to prevent the outbreak of yellow fever at the Sierra Leonean
refugee transit camp in Tarvey Town. MSF said its clinic in Tarvey holds 200
daily consultations.
The organization said there was an urgent need to relocate the refugees from
Tarvey. MSF said the camp was over crowded and bad road conditions make the
area inaccessible. The refugee population increased in Tarvey town as a
result of the Lofa
incursion.

[It is not clear from the wording of this report whether there is an actual
outbreak of yellow fever at the camp in Liberia, or even if there are cases
in Sierra Leone. If WHO is involved, & there is in fact an outbreak, one
would expect to see a notification in their Bulletin. We would appreciate
any further details - Mod.JW]
