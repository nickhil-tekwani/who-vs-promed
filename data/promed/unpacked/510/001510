THE [FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY AND TRANSLATION OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION [FROM
THE HEALTH MINISTRY OF ECUADOR [REPORTING A RABIES OUTBREAK
Vampire [bat-transmitted rabies is endemic to the Amazon basin of Ecuador.
Since 1996 there have been epidemic outbreaks in cattle and horses.
Rabies has been confirmed in more than 200 of these animals (cattle) and
[in 20 percent of those it was determined to be vampire [bat-transmitted.
During June [1997} the death of 8 children in the Cordillera del Condor was
reported and the autopsy revealed Staphylococcus pneumonia. The post
morten diagnosis was not consistent with [that of another victim who was
observed at the Civil Hospital of Sucua. In this case the patient showed
symptoms of encephalitis. Regrettably the other 8 children were not
observed [prior to autopsy, I presume --es by any physician. These 8
children died in a place located 40 minutes (helicopter) from Macas and 6
days walking distance through the forest. A task force organized by the
Ministry of Health traveled to the region located at the foothills of the
Cordillera del Condor, very close to the place where the armies of Ecuador
and Peru clashed (in 1995). The following are some of their findings.
Small towns at the Cordillera del Condor such as Numbatkaime, Kunkuki, and
Warintza [have experienced an increase of the number of vampire bats since
April of this year. The bats attacked domestic animals such as cattle,
horses and swine resulting in [almost total destruction of the livestock
(in just 2 months). These animals die with symptoms resembling rabies.
The local dwellings are primitive and allow easy access to vampire bats.
The victims were 8 children, 5 of them from Kunkuki and 3 from
Numbatkaime. Their ages ranged from 3-10 years and the deaths occurred
from May 27 to June 14 of this year, and just after the disappearance of
the livestock. The disease started with fever, headache, [and congestion
of the conjunctiva, [and progressed with agitation, seizures, salivation,
anorexia, hydrophobia, photophobia, hallucinations, respiratory
difficulties and death. The disease lasted 3 to 5 days and all the victims
were attacked by vampire bats one or two months before. The vampire bites
were mainly in the head and face. Only two adults were attacked.
There was no evidence of Yellow fever, other viral encephalitis or
poisoning. Apparently there was an outbreak of a respiratory disease of
unknown origin during June that affected children and adults.
25 out of 55 children living in the area were bitten in the head by
vampires two weeks prior to the task force's visit. These kids received
prophylactic treatment for rabies.

In Warinta 75 percent of the population has been bitten by vampires during
the last four weeks and they also received the same treatment. In the same
location there were 70 cattle at the time of the task force's visist, now
there are 8 animals left. Twenty-four bats were captured in just one hour,
14 were killed, and their tissues were obtained for analysis. The rest were
impregnated with difenadiona and released. All the bats captured were
vampires (_Desmodus rotundus_). This outbreak is similar to
another [that occurred in the Peruvian side of the Cenepa river
(distance=30 Km) killing
many indigenous people. [When, and how many victims? --es
Finally, the Ministry of Health has implemented a campaign to locate areas
with similar problems, [to conduct surveillance of new cases, [and for
identification of high risk areas, prophylactic treatments, education,
destruction of the vampire bat population, sample collection, etc.
