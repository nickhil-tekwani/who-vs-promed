[We have heard from a reliable source that a S.E.Asian country has
identified _Vibrio cholerae_ O139 from a large, current outbreak but
is suppressing the information. The following notice from WHO is an
attempt to stimulate the reporting of such cases, which is, in fact,
mandatory under the International Health Regulations for all Member
States of WHO.
**** Would anyone who can confirm laboratory proven cases of O139
please communicate with us and with WHO. We are willing to post
information with "Name withheld by request" as long as we know the
identity of the reporter - Mod.JW

Cholera - Vibrio cholerae O139 strain
---------------------------------------------
WHO stresses importance of careful monitoring of _Vibrio cholerae_
O139 strain
In 1992, the world was alarmed by a severe outbreak of cholera in the
Bay of Bengal caused by a non-O1 strain of _Vibrio cholerae_,
serogroup O139. The fast spread of this new strain to neighbouring
countries and the notification of imported cases in developed
countries, raised concern as to the possible occurrence of a new
pandemic of cholera.
_Vibrio cholerae_ O139 has been detected since then in 10 countries.
This new strain continues to be confined to South-East Asia. In 1998,
_V. cholerae O139_ has been isolated from 3 patients in Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region of China and 3 in India.
Although no major outbreaks have been caused by _V. cholerae_ O139
since 1994, the fear that this new strain could become a global
threat is still present, particularly in Asia, where extremely heavy
rainfalls and floods have contributed to an increase in cases and
deaths due to cholera.

The WHO Global Cholera Task Force recommends that efforts to monitor
the spread of _V. cholerae O139_ at a global level must be continued
and/or strengthened.
