The harvest season for grains such as corn in the Azuerence region worries health authorities, as it is the season when the mouse that transmits the hantavirus comes to residences in search of food.

So far this week, the situation has worsened and the 3rd case of a hantavirus [infection] in 2022 has now been confirmed in Los Santos province. The Department of Epidemiology of the Los Santos Health Region reported that in this instance it is an 8-year-old boy, a resident of the Bella Vista neighborhood of the Macaracas district.

According to the information provided, the child is in stable condition at the Joaquín Pablo Franco Sayas hospital in the city of Las Tablas. As reported, the child presents a picture of hantavirus fever and not of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome as was the situation of the 1st 2 reported patients.

For this year (2022), no deaths have been reported for the disease that occurs typically at this time of year.

According to the Ministry of Health, it is critically important to avoid the presence of rodents that transmit [the virus] near their houses for which as a main measure it is recommended to avoid grain storage inside their residences. In addition, residents of the premises should keep them clean, use metal containers with lids, sweep up loose grains, cover holes in doors, walls and pipes, and not allow water to accumulate.

The occurrence of cases of hantavirus infections is not unusual at this season of the year. They frequently occur in Panama's central provinces, including Herrera and Los Santos, on a yearly basis.

Although the above and the previous report do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for this case, an earlier WHO report indicates that Choclo is the hantavirus identified in previous cases, based on genomic sequence analysis (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report mentioned above -- or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done -- was Choclo virus, which confirms the ProMED conclusion.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and the adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection. - Mod. TY
