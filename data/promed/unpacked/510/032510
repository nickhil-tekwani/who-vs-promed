SEATTLE FIRM RECALLS FERMENTED SAUSAGE FROM WESTERN WASHINGTON STATE
September 12, 1997
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service
WASHINGTON -- Bavarian Meat Products, Inc., a Seattle, Wash., food
processing firm, is voluntarily recalling about 400 pounds of fermented
sausage because the product may be contaminated with _Salmonella_ bacteria,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced today.
"Bavarian Meat Products CERVELAT" sausage was distributed to retail food
stores mainly in the Western part of the state of Washington. A small
amount of the product was also distributed to military commissaries in the
state.
All packages of the product sold after September 1 are being recalled.
"EST. 6431" appears inside the USDA inspection seal on the product label.
No other product is affected by the recall.
"We urge consumers who have purchased the product after September 1 to
return it to the place of purchase," said FSIS Administrator Thomas J. Billy.
USDA discovered the problem through its routine monitoring program for
Salmonella in dry and semi-dry fermented sausage.
Consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella can cause salmonellosis, a
potentially serious disease. In general, healthy people rarely contract
salmonellosis; most susceptible are pregnant women and those with weakened
immune systems -- infants, the elderly, and the chronically ill.
Symptoms of salmonellosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and
diarrhea, and in some cases flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, and
headache.
Consumers with questions about the recall may phone the toll-free USDA Meat
and Poultry Hotline at 1-800-535-4555. The hotline can be reached from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday.
[E. coli O157:H7 and O111 have caused outbreaks in dry sausage in the US
and Australia. Fermented sausage is produced with a pH typically below 5.0
and dried, so contamination with _Salmonella_ would have seemed unlikely. --
