The number of measles cases in England and Wales hit a record high
last year [2008], sparking renewed fears of an epidemic. There were
1217 cases from January to November 2008 in England and Wales, the
highest number for 13 years, and the only time the number of cases
has exceeded 1000 in that period, according to the Health Protection
Agency (HPA). There were 990 measles cases reported in the whole of 2007.

The number of cases reported rose sharply in the autumn, with 115
cases reported in November 2008 alone, said the HPA, which monitors
infectious diseases. Worryingly, nearly 3/4th (74 percent) of the
cases diagnosed in that month were outside the traditional hotspot of
London in the West Midlands and the northwest and southeast of
England. Most of those cases are linked with measles outbreaks in
nurseries, primary and secondary schools. There have also been
outbreaks in traveler communities in the West Midlands and the southeast.

Dr Mary Ramsay, an HPA immunisation expert, said: "We are still
experiencing an unprecedented increase in measles cases across
England and Wales." More than 6 in 10 (65 percent) of all cases in
England and Wales were in children under the age of 15. The HPA said
measles was spreading more easily because of the relatively low
uptake of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) jab over the past
decade. Rates of vaccination in Britain slumped after an
unsubstantiated scare over the triple jab. There are about 3 million
children, one in 4 of whom have not had both MMR doses, which are
necessary to ensure they are fully protected. Ramsay said: "This
continued rise is due to relatively low MMR vaccine uptake over the
past decade, and there are now a large number of children who are not
fully protected with MMR. This means that measles, which is highly
infectious, is spreading easily among these unvaccinated children.
The agency is concerned that we may see measles epidemics take hold.
We again are urging parents to get their children vaccinated."

"Although MMR coverage is starting to improve, we cannot stress
enough that measles is serious, and in some cases it can be fatal.
Delaying immunisation puts children at risk. We are glad to see that
public confidence in the MMR vaccine is now high, with more than 8
out of 10 children receiving one dose of MMR by their 2nd birthday.
But we shouldn't forget that the children who weren't vaccinated many
years ago are at real risk. Measles is a very serious infection, as
it can lead to pneumonia and encephalitis, even in healthy children.
It is highly infectious and can be passed on without direct contact
before the rash appears."

Last year [2008], HPA research showed that, without a wider uptake of
the MMR vaccine, there was a real risk of a large measles epidemic of
between 30 000 to 100 000 cases, the majority in London. Earlier this
week, researchers warned that hopes of eradicating measles in Europe
by 2010 were in jeopardy due to poor vaccination rates in a handful
of countries including Britain. Doctors at the Statens Serum
Institute in Copenhagen, writing in the Lancet, said medical records
from 32 European countries confirmed 12 132 cases in 2006 and 2007,
the majority of which came from the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Italy
and Romania.

The North West [region of England] has been branded the measles
capital of the country, outside London. The Health Protection Agency
North West has issued a warning to parents to protect their children
with the MCC [MMR?] vaccine, as the region, including Greater
Manchester and Rochdale, has recorded the highest number of cases
outside the capital in October and November 2008.

The data reveal that in the 1st 11 months of 2008, the North West had
more confirmed measles cases than any other region outside London,
with 152 cases to the capital's 652. However, in October and November
2008, 62 cases were recorded in the North West compared to 56 in London.

Professor Qutub Syed, Director of HPA North West, said: "Our figures
were inflated by a major outbreak of measles in Central and Eastern
Cheshire in October and November [2008], and earlier in the year, we
had outbreaks in Lancashire, Merseyside and the Manchester area. We
also had sporadic cases elsewhere in the region. That is why it is so
important for parents to ensure that their children are vaccinated
with MMR at age 13 months and again before going to school. We also
need to keep reminding parents that it is not too late to have older
unprotected children vaccinated. Anyone up to the age of 18 is
entitled to contact their family doctor and ask for the MMR
vaccination, and it is important that they should do so. Measles is
highly infectious, and it can spread like wildfire when it gets into
unprotected communities. It can have serious side effects, including
fits, chest infections, meningitis, encephalitis, and, in extreme
cases, even death."

In November 2008, 115 cases of measles were confirmed in England and
Wales, an increase on each of the previous 2 months (83 and 72
respectively). This increase was attributable to cases outside of
London: the number of cases in London was the lowest monthly total
this year [1]. [Data illustrate graphically in the original text]

A provisional total of 1217 laboratory confirmed measles cases have
been reported in 2008 up to the end of November, exceeding the total
of 990 reported for the whole of 2007. The proportion of measles
notifications confirmed by a positive oral fluid test was 21 percent
in London and 27 percent in the rest of England and Wales.

The majority of the November 2008 cases (74 percent) were
concentrated in the North West, South East and West Midlands regions.
These regions continued to identify cases linked with outbreaks in
nurseries and in primary and secondary schools. In West Midlands and
South East regions, cases were also linked to outbreaks in traveler
communities. In addition, a nosocomial outbreak was identified when a
healthcare worker became infected after attending a child with measles.

65 percent of cases reported to November 2008 have been children less
than 15 years of age: 1-4 years (301 cases), 5-9 years (274 cases)
and 10-14 years (222 cases). Local MMR catch-up campaigns targeting
children and youngsters up to the age of 18 years are ongoing in many
areas [2, 3].

Both strains of the D4 genotype (MVs/Enfield/14.07 and MVs/Chester/
38.08) are continuing to circulate in different parts of England and Wales.

An article published in The Lancet this week suggests that, due to
suboptimum vaccination coverage in some countries, there is a real
possibility that the European region may fail to meet the measles
elimination goal set by the World Health Organization (WHO) [4]. The
paper examines epidemiological data submitted by 32 countries in
Europe to EUVAC.NET (a European surveillance network for vaccine
preventable diseases) for 2006 and 2007. Over 12 000 measles cases
were reported, most of which (85 percent) were in Romania, Germany,
Switzerland, Italy and UK.

[Elsewhere in the United Kingdom (Scotland and Northern Ireland),
where rates of vaccine uptake have been higher, rates of measles
infection have been lower. Overall uptake of the MMR vaccine in
Scotland remains high, with 91.7 percent of 2-year-olds and 94.9
percent of 5-year-olds having been immunised with at least one dose
of MMR, to protect them against measles, mumps and rubella.
