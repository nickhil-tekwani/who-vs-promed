South Africa: Potential Measles Threat for Travellers From Kinshasha
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Gauteng Provincial Health Department of South Africa wishes to
inform all travellers who arrived on flight SAA 051 from Kinshasa
which landed at Johannesburg International Airport, South Africa at
17:50 on Thu 18 Sep 2003, that an adult male passenger is being
treated for laboratory confirmed measles in a Gauteng Hospital. Upon
boarding the flight in Kinshasa on Thu 18 Sep 2003, the passenger
already had symptoms of measles which included a high fever, rash,
dry unproductive cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis (red, irritated,
light-sensitive, teary eyes) and a general ill feeling. Upon arrival
in South Africa, he consulted a medical doctor on Fri 19 Sep 2003 and
was admitted to hospital on the same day. A number of tests were
conducted, including for malaria, but after hearing that there was
currently a measles outbreak on the East Rand/Ekurhuleni Health
District in Gauteng, he realised that he had been in contact with his
sister's children who were clinically diagnosed with measles even
before he left on his business trip to Kinshasa (Democratic Republic
of the Congo) on Thu 11 Sep 2003. A subsequent test confirmed that he
in fact was suffering from measles. His travel history alerted health
authorities to issue a warning to inform all passengers and flight
crew aboard the said flight [SAA 051] to be on the lookout for
symptoms of measles (high fever, rash, dry unproductive cough, runny
nose, conjunctivitis and a general ill feeling) and to report to
their nearest health service provider for investigation. A blood and
urine specimen must be sent to the National Institute for
Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg for confirmation, even if
symptoms of Rubella (German measles) are suspected.
To date, 24 cases of measles have been laboratory confirmed and
notified in Gauteng since 1 Jan 2003; 3 cases in March, 2 in July, 5
in August and so far 10 in September. Only 2 laboratory confirmed
and 3 epidemiologically linked cases of measles were reported for the
whole of 2002 in Gauteng, confirming the current large outbreak in
the Province. These cases are now spreading all over Gauteng Province
from the East Rand (Ekurhuleni) to Pretoria and Johannesburg. One
laboratory confirmed measles case has been detected in Rustenburg on
Tue 23 Sep 2003. Not only children, but also adults are being
infected. The movement of people across municipal borders and between
different levels of health service provision (public and private
service providers) makes the containment and prevention of spread of
measles particularly difficult. The simultaneous occurrence of
laboratory confirmed Rubella (German measles) throughout Gauteng, is
contributing to complicating the correct diagnosis of measles cases.
Following an outbreak of laboratory confirmed measles in the Benoni
and Boksburg health sub-districts of Ekurhuleni in the beginning of
September, communicable disease multi-professional rapid response
teams of each sub-district have been put on the alert to implement
containment and control measures to prevent the further spread of
this acute, highly communicable viral disease.
Measles is the most infectious viral disease known to man. Measles
presents as a 2 to 3 day prodrome period (before rash) of fever,
general feeling of unwellness, cough and a runny nose (coryza). Teary
eyes (conjunctivitis) and bronchitis are commonly present. Although
there is no rash at the onset, the
patient is highly contagious. A non-productive cough is present throughout
the feverish period, persisting for 1 to 2 weeks in uncomplicated cases and
often being the last symptom to disappear. Swelling of the glands commonly
occurs in young children. Older children usually complain of sensitivity to
light and joint pains. Koplik's spots (small spots with white or
bluish-white centres, resembling "grains of salt sprinkled on a red
background) may be seen on the insides of the cheeks in over 80% of
cases before the onset of the rash. The blotchy red rash usually
appears behind the ears and on the face within 2 to 4 days after the
pre-rash feverish (prodrome) period. The rash peaks in 2 to 3 days
and becomes most concentrated on the trunk and upper extremities. It
lasts from 3 to 7 days. Malnourished or vitamin deficient children
may develop severe skin exfoliation. Complications of measles may
include middle ear infection,
blindness, diarrhoea, dehydration, respiratory infections, pneumonia,
neurological complications such as convulsions and even death. The
highest death rates occur in infants 6 to 11 months of age. These
rates may underestimate the true lethality of measles because of
incomplete reporting of the outcomes of measles illness, such as
delayed deaths related to chronic diarrhoea. In certain high-risk
populations case fatality rates as high as 20 or 30 percent have been
reported in infants less than 1 year of age.
The National Expanded Programme on Immunisation of South Africa is in
the elimination stage of measles to minimise and eventually eradicate
measles disease and deaths, through intensified efforts to increase
measles immunisation coverage of children. Two doses of measles
vaccine should be administered -- at 9 and 18 months of age. In
addition, every case of suspected measles (those with fever, a
blotchy rash and a dry cough, runny nose or conjunctivitis, must have
blood and urine tests done to determine whether the patient's
symptoms are due to measles, Rubella or any other infectious
condition as part of the Measles Elimination Programme.
Because there have been so few true measles cases in South Africa
following the introduction of the measles control and elimination
strategies as well as mass immunisation campaigns against measles in
1997, 1998 and 2000, measles and Rubella are often misdiagnosed.
Therefore, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD),
an accredited laboratory for the World Health Organisation, tests
blood and urine samples for free, as part of the National Measles
elimination Programme.
In the light of the current measles epidemic, all parents are urged
to ensure that their children's measles immunisations are up to date.
Measles immunisations are available free of charge from all public
and municipal health clinics. Medical Practitioners are especially
reminded that prompt telephonic reporting to their nearest local
authority Health Department of suspected measles or Rubella cases is
imperative to initiate swift outbreak response action by community
health services. Suspected cases in Gauteng Province must also be
reported to the Gauteng Communicable Diseases Hotline at (+27)
82-372-0554. Blood and urine specimens must be obtained from each
suspected case and sent to the NICD for testing. Hospital infection
control nurses should ensure that active surveillance and reporting
is done to detect any suspected measles cases. Hospital and clinic
waiting room spread of measles infections (not only amongst patients,
but also staff and visitors) could lead to the epidemic being
difficult to contain or interrupt if strict isolation and infection
control measures are not applied and adhered to. Medical staff
especially are requested to submit blood and urine for testing to the
NICD of all cases of fever and rash, especially where patient history
indicated contact with another case with diagnosed measles or
Rubella, as well as to telephonically report all cases to their
nearest District Health Authority and to the Gauteng Provincial
Communicable Diseases Hotline (+27) 82-372-0554) for an immediate
outbreak response to be launched. All immediate contacts of confirmed
measles cases should receive prophylactic measles immunisations to
contain the outbreak and prevent further spread of this serious
disease.

[The warning should perhaps be extended to include passengers on the outward
flight to Kinshasa on 11 Sep 2003, although the risk of transmission in the
pre-symptomatic stage of measles infection will be very much less but not
negligible. - Mod.CP]
[ProMED-mail would like to thank Johann M van den Heever for sending
this information to ProMED for dissemination. In 2001, there was a
report of imported cases of measles in Mexico with presumed exposure
in an airport in Texas en route to Mexico (the presumed exposure was
to a tour group from Korea at a time when there was known measles
transmission ongoing in South Korea.-- see ProMED-mail postings
referenced below) This current alert and the prior events serve as a
reminder that measles virus is still circulating in parts of the
world, and vaccinations should be up to date prior to embarking on
travel. - Mod.MPP]
