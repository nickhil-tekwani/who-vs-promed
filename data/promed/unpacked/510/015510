[Jia Youling, the country's chief veterinarian, said on Mon 11 Jun
2007,] that blue ear pig disease infected 45 858 swine in 22 Chinese
regions during the 1st 5 months of the year [2007].
The highly pathogenic disease, also known as porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome (PRRS), has killed 18 597 pigs and forced
another 5778 pigs to be culled, said Jia, who is also director of the
veterinary department of the Ministry of Agriculture.
Blue ear disease was 1st discovered in the United States in 1987 and
spread to China in mid 1990s, he said, adding the virus could not
infect humans.
Jia said China 1st spotted a more virulent form of the pig disease in
the summer of 2006, and identified it as a mutated highly pathogenic
strain in January of this year [2007]. "The virus has mutated and
caused higher mortality rates," he said.
China has twice reported the infections to the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) after pigs in Yunfu, in the
southern province of Guangdong, were infected with the virus, said
Jia.
Swine dying from "high fever diseases" were mainly suffering from
blue ear pig disease, but other viruses caused some deaths, said the
chief veterinarian. "Pigs killed by the 'high fever disease'
accounted for 0.2 percent of the total pig population," he stated.
Jia maintained that there is no evidence to support the idea that the
outbreak of blue ear pig disease has caused pork prices to jump. He
said the mortality rate of pigs from all causes is now between 6
percent and 8 percent, while in the 1980s, 10 percent of the pig
population died before they were slaughtered, said Jia.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the price of piglets in
April [2007] was 71.3 percent higher than a year earlier [2006],
while the price of live pigs was 45.2 percent higher, and the cost of
pork was up 29.3 percent.
A significant jump in the cost of feed and a decline in the pig
population were the major factors behind the rising pork prices this
year [2007], the chief veterinarian said. The pig population declined
mainly because pig farmers have incurred losses over the past couple
of years and were reluctant to raise them, said Xu Lianzhong, a
senior economist with the price supervision center under the National
Development and Reform Commission.
"The central government has allocated 280 million yuan (USD 36.5
million) to fund vaccinations of swine at various pig farms," Jia
said.
China successfully developed a vaccine for the new variant in 90 days
and approved 12 companies to produce the vaccine in May [2007], he
said, adding the government has distributed 20 million milliliters of
vaccine to disease-hit regions.
The output of the vaccine would total 70 million milliliters in June
[2007], 154 million milliliters in July [2007], and 189 million
milliliters in August [2007], the chief veterinarian said.
Jia also said the China Animal Disease Prevention and Control Center
has set up a reporting mechanism with 2600 counties nationwide to
ensure timely treatment and prevention.

An analysis of the causes and prevention strategies for pig unknown
high fever disease
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Pig unknown high fever disease" first broke out in Jiangxi, in May
2006. Since then, it has spread across most northern and southern
provinces (Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, Hebei, Yunnan, some areas of
Guandgong, some areas of Guangxi, the western part of Shandong,
Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui, Beijing/Tianjin/Tangshan, Liaoning,
Jilin, Inner Mongolia, etc.). The illness spreads quickly with
morbidity exceeding 50 percent and mortality as high as 50-90
percent, and reaching 100 percent on some farms. It has caused
serious economic damage to pig farms and pig-raising households. Some
pig farms have gone bankrupt because of this.
Since the disease 1st occurred, the Ministry of Agriculture has sent
numerous specialist teams to disease areas to [conduct] diagnosis.
Laboratory testing has ruled out zoonotic disease. At the same time,
African swine fever has been ruled out using detection methods
recommended by OIE (World Organization for Animal Health). [Notably,
China's notification to the OIE of 14 Sep 2006, included the
following statement: "We also tested 80 samples from sick pigs for
African swine fever with polymerase chain reaction as recommended by
the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals.
All of the results were negative, and the possibility of African
swine fever can therefore be ruled out". See report at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_78.HTM#Sec15>, and commentary
below. - Mod.AS]
Currently, the number of cases has dropped considerably and the
epizootic trend is improving. But the disease has recurred in some
farms and conditions remain serious. Some farms that escaped the
disease the 1st time will have no lucky escape with the 2nd wave.
This is different than most infectious diseases, since after the
occurrence of typical diseases, other pigs have a certain degree of
resistance and the next occurrence would be lighter than the 1st.

China vet says disease claimed 1 million pigs in 2006
-------------------------------------------
About a million pigs died in China last year of "high fever disease",
later identified as blue ear disease, the country's top veterinary
official said on Monday in the first official confirmation of the
death toll last year from a disease that has pushed up China's pork
prices.
China in January [2007] identified a contagious pig disease outbreak
as blue ear disease, or Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome
(PRRS). The outbreak began last May.
"The 'high-fever disease' was caused mainly by the blue-ear disease
virus, but other viruses cannot be ruled out," Jia Youling, head of
the veterinary department of the ministry of agriculture, told
reporters.
"The death rate from the 'high-fever disease' accounted for 0.2 percent of
the pig population (of 500 million)," Jia said.
Last week, the Ministry of Agriculture said the disease had killed
18,597 pigs in the first five months of 2007 with outbreaks found in
22 provinces, or about two-thirds of the country's provinces and
regions.
"The virus had developed into a variant that was more virulent and
led to higher mortality rates," Jia told a news conference.
Last week's release was Beijing's first report on the scale of an
outbreak that has disrupted the pig industry and contributed to
soaring pork prices, which are threatening to push inflation above
government targets.
Premier Wen Jiabao visited a pig farm last month, where he pledged to
ensure meat supplies for the poor.
The disease has caused panic among pig breeding farms, Jia said.

[Earlier, 7 Chinese provinces were named as affected by "swine high
fever disease" (SHFD), a multifactorial syndrome including PRRS.
These were the primary administrative regions Guangxi Autonomous
Region, Anhui, Hunan, Guangdong, Shandong, Liaoning, and Jilin (see
ProMED-mail 20070606.1828). According the unofficial Chinese
information of 5 May 2007 above, the following 10 provinces have been
affected as well: Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, Hebei, Yunnan, Zhejiang,
Fujian, Jiangsu, Beijing/Tianjin/Tangshan, and Inner Mongolia. This
brings the total number of provinces, allegedly and unofficially
affected by SHFD, to 17. This comes closer to the figures mentioned
in the current official information from China's veterinary services,
namely 22 provinces affected by PRRS. Clarification, and an official
list of provinces affected by a porcine disease or syndrome (under
either title), will help.
For an administrative map of China, see
<http://www.fas.usda.gov/pecad/remote/china/chinamap.gif>.
The flood of data, originating from various (official, semi-official,
unofficial, central, provincial, and foreign) sources, with
contradictory pieces of information on SHFD, its etiology and
distribution, could be put on hold if/when detailed, 1st hand,
authoritative results of laboratory investigations from each affected
province become available, pertaining to the entire range of
potential causal agents (including classical swine fever/CSF, African
swine fever/ASF, Avian influenza, and foot-and-mouth disease/FMD) and
preferably officially submitted to the OIE. It will be reassuring if
samples were submitted for confirmation to OIE's ASF reference
laboratory(ies). - Mod.AS]
