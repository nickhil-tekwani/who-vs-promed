With a dengue fever epidemic declared in February [2008] and still
uncontrolled, New Caledonia now has to combat water and
humidity-related diseases on another front, namely leptospirosis.

The dengue epidemic that has been affecting the capital Noumea and
its suburbs, but also the northeastern island if Lifou (Loyalty
island group) is now affecting over 320 persons, latest counts
revealed.

Prevention campaigns have intensified in the past few weeks and local
health services have urged the population to take heed of such simple
recommendations as cleaning any potential breeding site for the
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito (the vector of the disease) larvae.

The Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the 1st imported cluster
cases of dengue fever discovered in a family yesterday [9 Apr 2008].

Chou Chih-hao, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease
Control, said the patients were 4 children born to a Tongese mother
who was married to a Taiwanese man living in Taipei County.

Chou said the mother took her 4 children to visit Tonga, a South
Pacific island nation near New Zealand, and brought the children back
to Taiwan on 24 Mar [2008]. Her 4-year-old son was detected to have a
fever at the airport and was confirmed to have been infected with the
mosquito-borne disease.

Taipei County health authorities then took specimens from the mother
and her 3 daughters aged 8, 10, and 13. Tests confirmed that the 3
sisters were also infected, although the mother was not. But "only
one sister showed symptoms of fever on 28 Mar [2008], and the 2
others had no symptoms," Chou said, adding that all 4 children
recovered after taking medicine.

The centers estimated that there have been 24 imported dengue fever
cases so far this year [2008], compared with only 15 imported cases
during the same period last year [2007].

[ProMED-mail reported over 200 dengue cases in Tonga as of 2 Mar 2008
(see archive no. 20080309.0962). One would infer from the report
above of dengue cases showing up in Taiwan that the epidemic in Tonga
continues. ProMED would appreciate further information from Tonga
concerning the dengue outbreak there.

[An] expert has warned that a dengue fever epidemic would soon sweep
through Cambodia at a time when infections of the disease are usually
at their lowest, the Mekong Times newspaper said Thursday [10 Apr
2008].

Generally, dengue fever is most prevalent from early January till May
in Cambodia, but this year [2008] the worst period will be from the
end of April till July, claimed Ngan Chantha, vice director of
National Center For Dengue and Malaria Control.

Ngan Chantha said the change has resulted from many factors such as
the impact of the dengue epidemic in late 2007 and environmental
changes that have altered the existing virus and irregular rainfall.

Other subordinate factors such as unsanitary conditions and migration
exacerbate the problem, he said.

However, a combined Health Ministry and National Center Against
Dengue Fever campaign dubbed "Abate", an insecticide used to kill
mosquito larvae, should go some way towards reducing the risk, Ngan
Chantha said.

Officials are distributing Abate to people in high-risk areas for
them to add to their water storage to kill the _Anopheles_ mosquito
larvae that spread dengue fever when they reach adulthood. [This
statement is incorrect. _Aedes aegypti_ and possibly _Ae. albopictus_
are dengue virus vectors, not _Anopheles_ spp. mosquitoes. - Mod.TY]

Thailand's Public Health Minister Chaiya Sasomsub on Tuesday [8 Apr
2008] warned the public to keep alert to the dengue fever, as 9
people have died and over 7000 suffered from the disease during the
1st quarter of 2008.

During the 1st 3 months of this year [2008], the cumulative number of
patients soared to 7413, with 99 percent of them completely
recovered, Chaiya was quoted by the Thai News Agency as saying.
However, there were 9 fatalities in 8 provinces, he said.

The number of victims increased from the same period of last year
[2007], when there were 4209 patients and 4 dengue fatalities, the
minister said.

Chaiya said he had instructed local health officials nationwide to
maintain the campaign to eradicate the mosquito breeding habitats.

Malaysia continues to battle a steady rise in the number of dengue
cases for the 1st 3 months of the year [2008] as the death toll from
the mosquito-borne disease reached 26, a news report said Saturday [5
Apr 2008]. From January-March [2008], a total of 9889 people were
diagnosed with dengue and 26 of them died, the ministry's director of
disease control Hasan Abdul Rahman was quoted as saying by the New
Straits Times daily.

Last year [2007], there were a total 13 949 cases with 34 deaths from
January to March [2007].

Hasan said although the number of cases this year [2008] was lower
than last year [2007], the number of dengue victims increased from
month-to-month. He blamed the rise on weather conditions, which made
it conducive for the virus-carrying _Aedes_ mosquito to breed.

The central Selangor state recorded the most cases at 262, followed
by the capital Kuala Lumpur and the southern state of Johor, he said.

Last week, health ministry officials issued 144 compound notices on
houses and shops where the _Aedes_ mosquitoes were found breeding.
The _Aedes_ mosquito breeds in clear and stagnant water, such as
flower vases, uncovered barrels, buckets, and discarded tires.

The government has been holding campaigns to educate the public as
well as conduct checks on residential and construction sites in
efforts to stem the steady rise in dengue cases.

However, despite the efforts, the number of cases and deaths continue
to rise each year.

Dengue fever infections are mounting alarmingly in Singapore due to a
change to a more deadly strain of the disease, sparking fears of the
city-state's potentially worst epidemic yet news reports said Tuesday
[8 Apr 2008].

Unless the trend of infections is halted, health officials warn that
the number of sick people could hit record levels within 3 years.

The number of infections from January through March [2008] is already
60 percent higher than during the 1st quarter of 2007, said figures
published in The Straits Times. "If nothing is done to stop the
spread, the number of cases will increase very significantly," Dr Ng
Lee Ching, head of the Environmental Health Institute, was quoted as
saying.

The severe, flu-like illness is showing up in a more deadly form,
called dengue haemorrhagic fever, for which there is no vaccine or
cure, Ng said. Victims can only be treated for the symptoms, which
include high fever, body aches and nausea; 20 people died from it
last year [2007].

Experts are further concerned because the _Aedes_ mosquito, which
spreads the disease [virus], appears to be moving into areas where it
previously was not found.

The city-state is spending 200 000 Singapore dollars (USD 145 000) a
day in a massive effort to destroy breeding sites and a targeted war
against mosquitoes in areas where 2 or more people fall ill.

Last year [2007], more than 5000 homeowners were fined 200 Singapore
dollars (USD 145) for allowing mosquitoes to breed. Construction
sites found with the insect pests breeding are fined 2000 Singapore
dollars (USD 1459).

'We cannot understand why the numbers are climbing,' Ng said.

[The observation that the _Aedes_ dengue virus vector is showing up
in new areas may account for increasing numbers of dengue cases.
Previously, Singapore had been successful in controlling _Aedes_
populations through elimination of its breeding sites. One hopes that
the current campaign will achieve the same degree of success, and
serve as a model for other countries, especially in Southeast Asia
where 2008 is becoming a severe dengue outbreak year.

Since the beginning of March [2008], over the last 6 weeks, the
number of clinically suspected dengue cases remains stable around the
epidemic threshold (33 cases estimated last week [week of 31 Mar
2008]). The dynamics of laboratory confirmed cases is similar.

Since the beginning of the epidemic (2nd week of November), it is
estimated that there has been a total of about 2010 cases clinically
compatible with dengue. Over the same period, the number of
hospitalized laboratory confirmed dengue cases was 21 including 13
adults (including 9 serious forms [of the disease]) and 8 children
(presenting only common [classical dengue] forms).

Since mid-November [2007], the surveillance of [dengue virus]
serotypes has detected DEN-1.

For nearly 4 months, the number of clinically suspected dengue cases
stabilized at around 10-30 cases weekly, remaining at a level close
to the epidemic threshold. The same dynamic is observed in laboratory
confirmed cases.

Since the beginning of the pre-alert in mid-November [2007], it is
estimated that 460 people went to a general practice physician for a
syndrome compatible with dengue. During this same period, 6 adults
with severe forms [of dengue infection] were hospitalised.

Since December 2007, DEN [virus] serotype 1, has been most often
identified; serotype [dengue virus] DEN 2 has also been circulating.
