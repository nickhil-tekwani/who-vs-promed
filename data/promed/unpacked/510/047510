Diagnosis of diphtheria was approved in 8 schoolchildren
--------------------------------------------------
8 schoolchildren were admitted to the Omsk infectious diseases hospital.
According to the Government Epidemiologic surveillance center, all were
diagnosed with diphtheria. All other personnel and children who were in
contact with those infected are currently under observation.
According to epidemiologic data, 19 cases of diphtheria have been
registered in Omsk so far in 2003 and 11 of them are children. 3 people
died from diphtheria, and about half of the infected were not vaccinated.

[As stated in the moderator comment in ProMED-mail Diphtheria - Russia
(Urals) 20030502.1102: "Infection with _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ can
occur in the immunized individual (assuming these children were in fact
immunized). Certainly if the vaccine is inadequately handled (for example,
freezing the vial), immunogenicity will be diminished. The ultimate aim in
vaccination with diphtheria toxoid is the prevention of mortality by
neutralization of circulating toxin through the production of antitoxin.
Indeed, epidemiological studies of outbreaks have shown that immunization
does not prevent pharyngeal colonization with the organism but does reduce
the incidence of and morbidity and mortality from diphtheria."
Below is from the CDC travel site regarding diphtheria in the former Soviet
Union <http://www.cdc.gov/travel/easteurp.htm>:
"A diphtheria epidemic began in 1990 in Russia and spread to all of the
remaining New Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union by the
end of 1994. More than 150 000 cases and 5000 deaths have been reported
from the NIS in 1990-1998. Widespread immunization campaigns since 1994
have largely controlled the epidemic, although over 2700 cases were still
reported in 1998. A risk of diphtheria infection remains in all countries
of the former Soviet Union. Cases of diphtheria have continued to be
reported rarely in tourists and travelers to the NIS. Proof of diphtheria
immunity is not required for international travel. However, the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that travelers to
areas where diphtheria is occurring should be up-to-date for diphtheria
immunization.
The schedule for immunization against diphtheria in children <7 years old
requires a 4-dose primary series of diphtheria toxoid (at 2, 4, 6, and 12
to 18 months of age) and a booster at 4 to 6 years of age. The minimum
interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and between the 2nd and 3rd doses is
4 weeks; between the 3rd and 4th dose, the minimum is 6 months. Infants and
children <7 years old are usually given diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and
pertussis vaccine (DTP); children > 15 months may be given diphtheria and
tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) for the 4th and 5th
doses of the series. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids for pediatric use (DT)
should be substituted for DTP in children for whom pertussis vaccine is
contraindicated." <http://www.cdc.gov/od/ads/acipnet3.htm>
Infants traveling to areas where diphtheria is endemic or epidemic should
receive 3 doses of DTP or DT before travel. The first dose should be given
at 6 to 8 weeks of age and the next 2 doses after intervals of 4 to 8 weeks.
The primary schedule for persons >7 years of age who have never been
vaccinated requires 3 doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids for adult use
(Td) (the 2nd dose is given 4 to 8 weeks after the first; the 3rd dose is
given 6 to 12 months after the 2nd). 2 doses of Td received after an
interval of at least 4 weeks may provide some protection; a single dose is
of little benefit. Td booster doses should be given at 11 to 16 years of
age and whenever 10 or more years have elapsed since completion of a
primary series or the last booster dose containing diphtheria toxoid. For
persons whose primary schedule was interrupted, the series should be
completed by using a vaccine appropriate for age. For example, an adult who
received (as a child) 2 doses of a vaccine containing diphtheria toxoid
requires only 1 more dose of Td to complete the primary series and
additional Td boosters every 10 years thereafter. Boosters need not be
repeated more frequently than every 10 years.
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations on
diphtheria prevention (MMWR 1991;40(RR-10):1-28 should be consulted for
further details. - Mod.LL]
