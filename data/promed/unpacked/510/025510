Foot and mouth disease in Botswana: suspected outbreaks (OIE follow up
report No. 2)
----------------------------------
Information received on 25 Jan 2003 from Dr Micus Chiwasanee Chimbombi,
director of Animal Health and Production, Ministry of Agriculture,
Gaborone: end of previous report period: 15 Jan 2003 (see OIE Disease
Information 2003; 16(3): 17 Jan). End of this report period: 24 Jan 2003.
New suspected outbreak:
Location / No. of outbreaks
Annah Blackbeard farm (see map) 1
Description of affected population in the new suspected outbreak: one case
was recorded in a stray steer at Annah
Blackbeard Farm, which is also in the infected zone. The animal had lesions
consistent with those found in cattle in other crushes suspected of having
foot and mouth disease (FMD). The animal was later traced to the same herd
in Tsiteng in which 2 cases have been recorded. Resident animals in Annah
Blackbeard Farm did not have lesions or other clinical signs suggestive of FMD.
Total number of animals in the suspected outbreaks (updated data):
Outbreaks / species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
Matopi crush / bov / approx. 900 / 23 / 0 / 842 / 0
Tsiteng crush / bov / approx. 1000 / 2 / 0 / 928 / 0
Strauss farm / fau* /... / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Annah Blackbeard farm / bov /approx. 200 / 1 / 0 / 187 / 0
* greater kudu (_Tragelaphus strepsiceros_).
The disease has yet to be confirmed but the clinical presentation and
preliminary results are highly indicative of a SAT-virus related outbreak.
The diagnosis is being made at Botswana Vaccine Institute and Institute for
Animal Health and the Pirbright Laboratory, United Kingdom (OIE Reference
Laboratories for foot and mouth disease).
Diagnostic tests used:
- On immediate screening by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 7
out of the 9 bovine serum samples sent were found to be positive for SAT 1
and SAT 2, but after 3 passages with sensitive cell culture (pig kidney
cell line), no FMD virus was detected in any samples (epithelium,
esophagopharyngeal epithelial samples [probangs], and serum).
- The kudu samples were similarly positive on immediate screening by ELISA,
but no virus was detected after 2 passages with sensitive cell culture (pig
kidney cell line). Titration is being done on the screen-positive sera to
determine the level of antibody activity that may be present (results awaited).
Causal agent:
- In cattle: SAT 1 or 2 suspected from preliminary ELISA screening test
results, but negative on virus isolation.
- In kudu: SAT 1 suspected from preliminary ELISA screening test results,
but negative on virus isolation.
Epidemiology:
Source of agent / origin of infection: unknown.
Mode of spread: suspected to be contact with infected animals or material.
Control measures during reporting period:
Area demarcation, biosecurity, quarantine and movement restrictions: see
Follow-up report No. 1 (Foot & mouth disease - Botswana (03): OIE
20030121.0187).
Stamping out: mass destruction of cattle at crushes in the infected zones
finished on 23 Jan 2003, with 3012 cattle destroyed.
Summary of destruction figures from the infected zone
Crush / bovines
Matopi / 842
Tsiteng / 928
Strauss (Mokata) / 286 (and 58 pigs)
Annah Blackbeard Farm / 187
Maswikiti / 338
Old Blackbeard Farm / 226
Strauss (Shashe) / 205
Total / 3012 bovines / 58 pigs
A mopping-up exercise has begun, using ground teams which will soon be
reinforced by aerial surveys to spot animals. The area remains blockaded to
prevent any incursion by animals from the surveillance zone.
Given the ability of pigs to contract and transmit the disease easily, all
58 pigs in the only pig farm in the infected zone were destroyed as a
precautionary measure.
Vaccination stopped on 19 Jan 2003, to give way to the destruction of all
vaccinated animals.
Surveillance:
In cattle: The first round of clinical surveillance and serological
sampling in the immediate surveillance zone (which covers Francistown
district [Veterinary Disease Control Zone No. 6] and Selebi-Phikwe district
[Veterinary Disease Control Zone No. 7]), is complete, with 23 398 of the
estimated 40 000 cattle having been inspected. Serum samples were collected
from 5600 cattle in crushes considered to be in very high risk areas. There
were no lesions or other clinical signs suggestive of FMD. This coverage
(58 per cent) is considered poor, and as such a follow-up campaign was
therefore started on 21 Jan 2003, with extended effort to enhance coverage.
Part of the disparity in figures is attributable to drought (a lot of
animals have died since the last census).
In small stock: historically, these have played a relatively less
significant role in the epidemiology of FMD in this country. To minimise
chances of inspection teams infecting small stock, their detailed
inspection will be done after the disease in cattle has been contained.
In pigs: Given their ability to contract and transmit the disease easily,
all 58 pigs in the only pig farm in the infected zone were destroyed as a
precautionary measure.
In wildlife: The FMD survey in resident cloven-hoofed wildlife species
(kudu [_Tragelaphus strepsiceros_] and impala [_Aepyceros melampus_]) to
establish the extent of the disease started on 20 Jan 2003 and is
continuing. Boma capturing and darting are techniques being used to capture
these animals. To date, 17 kudu and 48 impala have been inspected and were
found to have no lesions suggestive of FMD. Serum samples and probangs were
also taken.

Botswana experienced a previous outbreak of FMD between February and May
2002. It resulted in the slaughter of over 12 000 cattle and 131 pigs. As
in the present outbreak, there were a few thousand animals in the
clinically affected herds. The good news is the current outbreak seems
strikingly similar to last year's event. The bad news is that an outbreak
has recurred this year. The government has warned that compensation for
future FMD events might not be forthcoming if people continue to create
conditions conducive to disease spread from neighboring Zimbabwe. Once
again, we see that diseases that are uncontrolled don't respect
international borders. - Mod.PC]
