The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission (AGFC) has received confirmation that 2 additional deer have tested positive for chronic wasting disease [CWD] in Arkansas.

A deer in Madison County and another deer in Pope County were positive for the fatal disease. Both deer were road kills that were reported by the public. The Madison County deer was a 2.5-year-old doe found near Kingston and 2.9 miles west of the CWD focal area.

The Pope County deer was a 2.5-year-old buck found 44.4 miles south of the focal area near London. The 2 positive samples came from a batch of 131 deer sent to the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Madison. The 1st phase of chronic wasting disease sampling by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission revealed a 23 percent prevalence rate in Newton and Boone counties. Of 266 randomly collected wild deer, 62 were found to have the fatal disease.

To determine the prevalence of the disease among deer, the AGFC took samples 14-24 Mar [2016] within a 125 000-acre, capsule-shaped area ranging from 5 miles west of Ponca to 5 miles east of Pruitt, and 10 miles across. Including the sampled area, the AGFC has now received results of 84 animals with the disease. A total of 674 wild animals (645 white-tailed deer and 29 elk) have been sampled since laboratory results confirmed the disease 23 Feb 2016.

81 deer and 3 elk have been found to be positive. Phase No. 2 of the sampling effort has focused on learning the spatial distribution of the disease, and includes statewide collection of sick or dead deer and elk. This phase of the sampling effort will continue through 20 May [2016]. The 1st case of CWD in Arkansas was found in a 2.5-year-old female elk killed by a hunter 6 Oct [2015] on the Buffalo National River near Pruitt during elk hunting season. It was the 1st animal in Arkansas confirmed to have CWD.

Samples from the diseased female elk were 1st tested at the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Madison and verified by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, 23 Feb [2016]. Anyone who sees a sick, dead or road-killed deer or elk should contact the AGFC's radio room at (800) 482-9262. Operators are available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Reports will be sent to the appropriate person to collect samples.

Deer or elk infected with CWD tend to stay away from herds, may lose their fear of humans, walk in patterns, carry their head low, salivate excessively and grind their teeth. As the disease progresses, the animal will lose weight, develop an insatiable thirst and lose bodily functions. The AGFC will hold a public meeting at 6 p.m., 18 May 2016, at Carroll Electric Cooperative, 511 E. Court St. in Jasper, to update the public on proposed hunting regulations.

[This appears to be an extension of the disease within Arkansas. The AGFC appears to be diligently searching for cases to determine a prevalence rate of the disease with in a strategic county area. When animals with the disease are found outside that area, it will likely cause AGFC to broaden the control zone. - Mod.TG
