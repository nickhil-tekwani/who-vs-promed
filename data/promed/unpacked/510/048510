Moroccan media outlets Goud.ma and Aljarida24.com prompted concerns over a probable outbreak of the West African ebolavirus in Morocco. As a matter of fact, the sources alleged that the Moroccan authorities may have sent some West Saharan natives directly from Airport Mohammed V in Casablanca to the Moulay Youssef hospital after suspecting their contamination with the virus.

The Moroccan authorities denied this right away.

Mr Abdelghani Drhimeur, Ministry of Health's spokesman, said that "no infection case with the ebolavirus has been detected, whether within Morocco or in any of its airports," as relayed by aufaitmaroc.ma.

Reports from the Noguchi Memorial Institute of Medical Research in the University of Ghana showed that there are no cases of ebolavirus in Ghana, a Nigerian epidemiologist has said.

A state epidemiologist with the Lagos State Ministry of Health, Dr Ismail Abdus-Salam, told Channels Television on Friday [11 Apr 2014] that he spoke with a colleague at the institute and he confirmed that the suspected case of ebolavirus disease in the Ashanti region of Ghana was not Ebola. "I spoke with a colleague at the Noguchi Memorial Institute of Medical Research, in the University of Ghana on Thursday morning [10 Apr 2014] and he said the test conducted on the suspected infected person was negative for Ebola and other typical viral haemorrhagic fevers."

Ghana's health authorities had announced the 1st suspected case of the deadly ebolavirus disease at the country's 2nd biggest hospital, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), in Kumasi. The deputy director of public health in the Ashanti region, Dr Joseph Oduro, said on Sunday evening [6 Apr 2014] that the case resulted in the death of a 12 year old girl. Oduro said the victim, who was admitted to the paediatric unit of the Teaching Hospital with symptoms of fever and bleeding, died, and during a postmortem it was detected she had internal bleeding.

He said the development was alarming since neighbouring countries like Guinea and Liberia had recorded cases of the viral infection. Blood samples of the victim were sent to the Medical Research Institute in Accra for testing. According to Dr Ismail Abdus-Salam's statement, the result of the test was negative. He, however, advised that proper port surveillance should be embarked on to ensure that people with the ebolavirus would not enter into any country unnoticed.

The ebolavirus disease does not have any cure or vaccine and no specific symptoms are known. The disease has already killed dozens of people in neighbouring Guinea, with reported cases in Liberia and Mali.

Earlier this week a sigh of relief was breathed in Portugal, after a Portuguese national who had recently travelled to Liberia and who was suspected of having contracted Ebola, tested negative for the virus.

While laboratory analyses have quashed concerns that he may have contracted the ebolavirus and brought it back to Portugal, Portuguese immigration and health authorities have nonetheless guaranteed all "procedures appropriate to the situation at hand are ongoing and planned" to deal with an outbreak should it be necessary.

In response to concerns, Portugal's Directorate General of Health (DGS) issued an advisory note suggesting patients be immediately isolated "if a presumed diagnosis of Ebola virus disease is made in a patient with a clinical diagnosis and who has returned recently (within 21 days) from a region where the virus is active." A dedicated phone-line has been made available to medical professionals who come across suspected cases of Ebola.

Francisco George, head of the DGS, also reiterated this week that Portugal is prepared to deal with any eventual cases of Ebola should it be confirmed in this country, and said that all regions are instructed on how to proceed. "In less than 4 hours a citizen [of Guinea or Liberia] can be in Lisbon. It is necessary to draw up emergency measures to stop the activity of the virus from a case that may have just arrived. And we are prepared. We do have a plan for it which is activated whenever necessary." National airline TAP operates flights to Dakar (Senegal) and Bamako (Mali), both of which neighbour with Guinea. According to the BBC, Mali is controlling traffic into and out of its capital, Bamako, and its airport, and using thermal cameras to screen for people who might have fevers.

In a statement sent to The Portugal News WHO spokesperson Gregory Hartl explained: "In the history of Ebola, there has never been a case outside equatorial Africa. In the current event, all the cases are connected with a single chain or tree of transmission. Therefore, it would be highly, highly unlikely that there would be any cases arriving in Portugal. "But it is a terrible disease and until we know we have this outbreak controlled, everyone should remain vigilant." Also vulnerable to contracting the disease are health workers and international aid workers dispatched to the region to help with the outbreak.

ProMED-mail tries to balance posting reports of suspected cases, as an early warning, against the possibility that they may not be finally confirmed. - Mod.JW]
