With 352 cases reported [so far in 2006], India seems to be in a grip of a
polio outbreak.
To worsen the matter, many of these cases are from areas that were free of
the virus.
Uttar Pradesh alone has reported 312 cases, the highest of all the states
and World Health Organization officials have described it as an 'exporter'
of the disease. Bihar is in the 2nd position with 20 cases. Polio has also
resulted in 23 deaths, most of them from Uttar Pradesh.
Alarmed by the situation, states like Kerala, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Jammu
and Kashmir, Goa, Orissa and Tamil Nadu have initiated steps to ensure they
retain their polio-free status.
Union health ministry officials said Southern states have managed to resist
the polio virus because they have achieved 80 to 90 percent immunization.
In Maharashtra, where 2 polio cases have been reported, health officials
are conducting complete routine immunization among the estimated 2 crore
(20 million) children aged less than 5 years, Asia Age reported here.
During 2005, only 66 cases of polio, which is a viral paralytic disease,
were reported across the country.
In Uttar Pradesh, officials said 90 percent of the cases are due to
ignorance in the minority Muslim community, who believed the polio vaccine
could make children impotent.
The state government has intensified its fight against the virus and
launched special measures to overcome misconceptions among the people,
officials said.
"The polio virus is active till October and starts going down from then on.
The next few weeks will give us the real picture. But we are hopeful," said
an official of the Union Health Ministry.
The next round of the Pulse Polio vaccination drive, covering 100 million
children, will be conducted on 12 Nov [2006]. Delhi, Bihar, Haryana,
Punjab, Bihar, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, West Bengal,
Assam and Tripura will be covered during this drive.
Also, 11 districts of Karnataka will see an intensive anti-polio drive.
West Bengal, where one polio case has been reported, has witnessed an
encouraging response to the last polio program that covered nearly 100
percent of the target population.
Orissa, which has not reported any polio case since 2004, is set to become
a polio-free state.
Union Health Minister A. Ramadoss, who convened an emergency meeting in
Delhi that was attended by the health ministers of the polio-affected
states, said that 7 to 15 percent of children missed the immunization program.

[In the last ProMED-mail update on polio (Poliomyelitis - worldwide (12):
Asia, Africa 20060912.2587), the increase in cases in India this year was
mentioned, along with mention of the reappearance of cases of polio in
states that had previously interrupted transmission of the wild
poliovirus. The above newswire further highlights this situation.
At the time of our last posting (12 Sep 2006), there were 255 cases of
polio reported in Uttar Pradesh (UP), whereas there have now been 312 cases
reported, an increase of 57 cases in approximately 3 weeks. According to
the latest figures available on the polioeradication website case count
page (which is current through Tues 26 Sep 2006, and will most likely be
updated today or tomorrow), 323 cases have been reported in India so far in
2006, as compared with 30 cases reported from India during the same time
frame in 2005. <http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>
The following is excerpted from the polio eradication website's monthly
report as of 12 Sep 2006:
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/current_monthly_sitrep.asp>
"The outbreak centred in and around Moradabad district, western UP,
continues to intensify, with polio spreading to previously polio-free areas
within the country. The risk of further international spread is extremely
high. In response, India is looking at the feasibility of conducting a more
extensive immunization campaign in November, to limit the spread of polio
within and out of western UP.
Moradabad and surrounding districts now account for over half (52 percent)
of India's cases in 2006 (148 of 283 cases). By comparison, for the same
period in 2005, only 29 cases had been confirmed in the entire country. By
contrast, strong progress continues to be achieved in Bihar state -- with
only 17 cases reported in 2006 -- again demonstrating that polio
eradication strategies work, if implemented correctly."

Uttar Pradesh is located in northern India immediately to the east of the
capital, New Delhi.
A map showing Uttar Pradesh and its districts can be found at:
<http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/uttarpradesh/uttar-pradesh-district.htm >
(Moradabad is number 8 on the map, located in the northeastern part of UP
bordering Nepal). Given the close proximity to Nepal, one does wonder if
there is wild poliovirus circulation in neighboring communities in Nepal.
According to the poliovirus eradication website
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>, as of 26 Sep 2006, there
have been 2 cases of polio confirmed in Nepal so far in 2006, with the most
recent date 1 Aug 2006 (whereas the date of onset of the most recent
confirmed case in India is listed as 29 Aug 2006). Of note, both cases
reported in Nepal are classified as importation-related
(<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>). - Mod.MPP]
