The virus [human immunodeficiency virus] that causes AIDS [acquired
immune deficiency syndrome] can hide in the bone marrow, avoiding
drugs and later awakening to cause illness, according to new research
that could point the way toward better treatments for the disease.
Finding that hide-out is a 1st step, but years of research lie ahead.

Dr. Kathleen Collins of the University of Michigan and her colleagues
report in this week's edition of the journal Nature Medicine (see [3]
below) that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can infect
long-lived bone marrow cells that eventually convert into blood
cells. The virus is dormant in the bone marrow cells, she said, but
when those progenitor cells develop into blood cells, it can be
reactivated and cause renewed infection. The virus kills the new
blood cells and then moves on to infect other cells, she said. "If
we're ever going to be able to find a way to get rid of the cells,
the 1st step is to understand where a latent infection can continue,"
Collins said.

In recent years, drugs have reduced AIDS deaths sharply, but patients
need to keep taking the medicines for life or the infection comes
back, she said. That's an indication that while the drugs battle the
active virus, some of the disease remains hidden away to flare up
once the therapy is stopped. One hide-out was found earlier in blood
cells called macrophages. Another pool was discovered in memory
T-cells, and research began on attacking those. But those couldn't
account for all the HIV virus still circulating, Collins said,
showing there were more locations to check out and leading her to
study the blood cell progenitors.

Finding these sources of infection is important because eliminating
them would allow AIDS patients to stop taking drugs after their
infection was over. That's critical in countries where the treatment
is hard to afford and deliver. "I don't know how many people realize
that although the drugs have reduced mortality we still have a long
way to go," Collins said in a telephone interview. "That is mainly
because we can't stop the drugs, people have to take it for a
lifetime."

The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health,
Burroughs Wellcome Foundation, University of Michigan, Rackham
Predoctoral Fellowship, National Science Foundation and a Bernard
Maas Fellowship.

[2] UMHS press release

University of Michigan (U-M) scientists have identified a new
reservoir for hidden HIV-infected cells that can serve as a factory
for new infections. The findings, which appear online today [7 Mar
2010] in Nature Medicine (see abstract at [3] below), indicate a new
target for curing the disease so those infected with the virus may
someday no longer rely on AIDS drugs for a lifetime. "Antiviral drugs
have been effective at keeping the virus at bay. However, once the
drug therapy is stopped, the virus comes back," says senior author of
the study Kathleen L. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of
both internal medicine and microbiology and immunology at the U-M
Medical School.

In people infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), the virus
that causes AIDS (acquired immune deficiency disease syndrome),
there's an unsolved problem with current anti-viral drugs. Though
life-saving, they cannot root the virus out of the body. Infected
cells are able to live on, undetected by the immune system, and
provide the machinery for the virus to reproduce and spread.

This has led researchers to believe HIV-infected cells may lie in
wait somewhere in the body. Important new research by U-M has
discovered that bone marrow, previously thought to be resistant to
the virus, can contain latent forms of the infection. "This finding
is important because it helps explain why it's hard to cure the
disease," Collins says. "Ultimately to cure this disease, we're going
to have to develop specific strategies aimed at targeting these
latently infected cells." "Currently, people have to take anti-viral
drugs for their entire life to control the infection," she says. "It
would be easier to treat this disease in countries that don't have
the same resources as we do with a course of therapy for a few
months, or even years. But based on what we know now, people have to
stay on drugs for their entire life."

Using tissue samples, U-M researchers detected HIV genomes in bone
marrow isolated from people effectively treated with antiviral drugs
for more than 6 months. While further studies are needed to
demonstrate that stem cells can harbor the HIV virus, the study
results confirm that HIV targets some long-lived progenitor cells,
young cells that have not fully developed but mature into cells with
special immune functions. When active infection occurs, the toxic
effects of the virus kill the cell even as the newly made viral
particles spread the infection to new target cells.

"Our finding that HIV infects these cells has clear ramifications for
HIV disease, because some of these cells may be long-lived and could
carry latent HIV for extended periods of time," she says. "These HIV
cell reservoirs can be induced to generate new infections." The new
research gives a broader view of how HIV overwhelms the body's immune
system and devastates its ability to regenerate itself.

Globally, more than 30 million people are infected with HIV,
including millions of children. Improvements have been made since the
1990s in the way the disease is treated that have led to an 85-90
percent reduction in mortality. "Drugs now available are effective at
treating the virus, making HIV more of a chronic disease than a death
sentence," Collins says. "This has made a huge impact in quality of
life; however, only 40 percent of people worldwide are receiving
anti-viral drugs, and unfortunately that means that not everybody is
benefiting."

Title: HIV-1 infects multipotent progenitor cells causing cell death
and establishing latent cellular reservoirs Authors: Christoph C
Carter, Adewunmi Onafuwa-Nuga, Lucy A McNamara, James Riddell IV,
Dale Bixby, Michael R Savona and Kathleen L Collins.

Abstract: HIV causes a chronic infection characterized by depletion
of CD4+ T lymphocytes and the development of opportunistic
infections. Despite drugs that inhibit viral spread, HIV infection
has been difficult to cure because of uncharacterized reservoirs of
infected cells that are resistant to highly active antiretroviral
therapy (HAART) and the immune response. Here we used CD34+ cells
from infected people as well as in vitro studies of wild-type HIV to
show infection and killing of CD34+ multipotent hematopoietic
progenitor cells (HPCs). In some HPCs, we detected latent infection
that stably persisted in cell culture until viral gene expression was
activated by differentiation factors. A unique reporter HIV that
directly detects latently infected cells in vitro confirmed the
presence of distinct populations of active and latently infected
HPCs. These findings have major implications for understanding HIV
bone marrow pathology and the mechanisms by which HIV causes persis!
tent infection.

[The finding that HIV infects some long-lived progenitor cells is an
important feature of HIV disease because some of these cells could
carry latent HIV for extended periods of time. Subsequently, such HIV
cell reservoirs may be induced to generate new infections. The
ability of HIV to target certain long-lived progenitor cells explains
some of the features of AIDS and explains the inability to eradicate
the virus by treatment with antiviral drugs targeting replicating
virus.

The multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells used experimentally in
the experiments conducted at the University of Michigan were CD34+
cells from infected people. CD34 is an important adhesion molecule
that is required for T cells to enter lymph nodes. It is expressed on
lymph node endothelia whereas the L-selectin to which it binds is on
the T cell (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD34>). Cells
expressing CD34 (CD34+ cell) are normally found in the umbilical cord
and bone marrow as hematopoietic cells. Cells expressing CD34 respond
to SCF (stem cell factor) and LIF in the presence of colony
stimulating factors (see: CSF), and these factors can induce myeloid
differentiation in these cells (see
<http://www.copewithcytokines.de/cope.cgi?key=cd34>).
