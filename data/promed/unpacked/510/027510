You may recall newspaper or e-mail list server accounts of a recent case of
vesicular stomatitis/pharyngitis in a Mesa County, Colorado, teenager. The
suspected etiologic agent was [a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV),
presumably acquired by exposure to horses (an equine epizootic of VSV
occurred in Mesa County and elsewhere in the southwestern United States
this summer). The patient is a horse owner who had attended the Colorado
State Fair during mid-August, but there was no history of exposure to known
sick horses. A convalescent-phase serum specimen drawn from the patient
about 6 weeks post-illness onset was tested here [Division of Vector-Borne
Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control, Ft. Collins, Colorado
and found to be negative for neutralizing antibodies to VSV (both
VSV-Indiana and VSV-New Jersey). Therefore, it appears that the tentative
clinical diagnosis of VSV infection in this case was incorrect. The most
likely etiologic agents would include a Coxsackie virus, an enterovirus, or
a herpes simplex virus. Well-documented cases of symptomatic VSV infection
in humans are extremely rare.

[As I recall, the medical spokesperson (as reported by a newspaper) was
certain of the diagnosis. ProMED-mail pointed out that the newspaper
report did not indicate which VS virus was responsible for the young
woman's illness or how the diagnosis was made
and assumed that the diagnosis of her illness was not simply based on
clinical appearance. Apparently, it was simply based in clinical
appearance. This is yet another example of the reason laboratory support
is needed for diagnosis of virus and other infections. Thanks to Roy
Campbell for putting us straight. - Mod.CHC
