[1] Sierra Leone: 11th local doctor dies from Ebola
Date: Thu 18 Dec 2014

One of Sierra Leone's most senior physicians died [Thu 18 Dec 2014] from Ebola, the 11th doctor in the country to succumb to the disease, a health official said.

Ebola has killed more than 350 health workers in West Africa, depleting the ranks of doctors and nurses in countries that already had too few to begin with. Because Ebola is spread through bodily fluids, it is only transmitted through close contact. It is often called the "caregivers' disease" because those infected are typically family members caring for the sick or health workers treating them.

Dr VW tested positive for Ebola on [Sat 13 Dec 2014] and was being treated at a clinic near the capital run by the medical charity Emergency, said Dr Brima Kargbo, the country's chief medical officer. "[He] was a mentor to us physicians and a big loss to the medical profession," said Kargbo. "He has always been available to help junior colleagues."

The 67-year-old died [Thu 18 Dec 2014] morning, just hours after an experimental drug arrived in the country for him. The arrival of ZMAb, developed in Canada, had raised hopes for his survival. But he died before a dose could be administered, said Kargbo. ZMAb is related to ZMapp, another experimental drug that has been used to treat some Ebola patients. The drugs' efficacy in treating Ebola has not yet been proven... -- more

[Perhaps Sierra Leonean doctors working overseas (10 in the UK alone) should apply for leave to return and help?

I can imagine much confusion resulting from giving a new drug a name similar to an existing drug -- especially in the harried environment of an Ebola ward, and also over the phone from journalists. - Mod.JW]

[2] Guinea: 1st case of Ebola in the western mining city of Fria

[The mining city of Fria, in the west of Guinea, has registered its 1st case of Ebola virus disease. The case is a woman, native of Fria, who returned from a stay in Kindia, in Lower Guinea, where she became infected. The woman died on [Tue 16 Dec 2014].

The Russian-owned aluminium mine in Fria closed after a strike more than 2 years ago. - Mod.JW]

[3] Region: US army scientist used diagnostic tools to track viruses
Date: Wed 17 Dec 2014

An Army virologist, Dr Randal J Schoepp, using diagnostic tools, found antibodies to Ebola virus in patient samples from West Africa -- a region then thought to be untouched by the disease -- 7 years before the present Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

Dr Schoepp is chief of the Applied Diagnostics Department, Diagnostic Systems Division, at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). He recently returned from Liberia and Sierra Leone, where he spent 12 weeks helping to set up an Ebola testing lab and training local personnel to run Ebola diagnostic tests on clinical samples.

In 2006, Dr Schoepp was working in Sierra Leone at the Kenema Government Hospital in Eastern Province, helping a collaboration of USAMRIID and Tulane University scientists who were there to develop and refine Lassa fever diagnostic tests and build host-country diagnostic capacity. The scientists were testing samples of blood plasma and blood serum using immunodiagnostics, or diagnostic tests that use antibodies to detect the actual virus or virus products, or antibodies that result from infections with those viruses. As the work continued in Sierra Leone, the scientists found that, of the 500-700 samples a year submitted to the Kenema Government Hospital Lassa Diagnostic Lab from Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea, only 30-40 percent were actually Lassa fever positive.

Dr Schoepp said he got interested in the 60-70 percent that weren't Lassa. The aim of his study, he explained, was to find out which other viruses caused serious illnesses in the region and to help medical and technical personnel there learn how to detect the illnesses. The samples looked at had already had been screened for Lassa and malaria, and yielded in the end about 400 samples, taken from 2006 to 2008, that represented 253 patients. Using these samples, studies were made for serologic evidence of infection with other arthropod-borne viruses -- "dengue, Rift Valley fever, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, all the ones you would expect to see in Africa," he said -- as well as hemorrhagic fever viruses such as Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, Marburg, Ebola, and others.

Out of all that study, he said, the most significant finding "was that 8.6 percent of the samples had IgM antibodies to Ebola, and looking further into the Ebola antibodies with the plaque reduction neutralization test [PRNT], most of the Ebola antibodies were against the Zaire strain, the one that is now causing the West African outbreak, in a region supposedly untouched by Ebola except for a single case of the Tai Forest strain reported in Cote d'Ivoire in 1994.

In July 2014, a scientific paper about the earlier West African Ebola finding was published in the CDC's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal, after careful reviews by 2 sets of scientists... -- more

"...most of the Ebola antibodies were against the Zaire strain." That appears to mean they also found antibodies against other Ebola strains such as Sudan. Although the PRNT is generally more specific than the IgM-Elisa test, among ebolaviruses there is considerably cross-reaction even in that test. In any case, they were survivors of unreported infections by hemorrhagic fever ebolaviruses. - Mod.JW]
