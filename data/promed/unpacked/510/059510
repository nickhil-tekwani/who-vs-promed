Scab Disease Causes Serious Damage to Small Grain Crops
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------
Six successive years of disease have taken their toll on many small grain
farmers in the Red River Valley of North Dakota, Minnesota, and Manitoba.
This extended episode is bringing ruin to many farmers in the region.
Additional outbreaks in Midwestern and Eastern states of the USA as well as
Central and Eastern Canada are leaving thousands of farmers searching for
solutions.
The fungal pathogen responsible for the vast devastation is primarily
_Fusarium graminearum_ which causes Fusarium head blight, more commonly
known as scab. This all-consuming disease shrivels the kernels of small
grains such as wheat, rye and barley, significantly reducing yields.
"Moisture, at the time of flowering, is the main stimulus necessary for
scab,'' says Robert W. Stack, plant pathologist at North Dakota State. "If a
wet environment exists for an extended period, even with low levels of the
fungus in the field or temperatures that aren't usually favorable to disease
development, severe scab disease can result.''
During the first part of this century, scab was considered a major threat to
wheat and barley and recently it has resurfaced worldwide increasing in
intensity. A succession of "wet cycle'' years beginning in 1993 is linked to
the current scab epidemic. According to the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA), "From 1991 to 1997, American farmers lost 470 million
bushels of wheat, worth $2.6 billion, because of the scab epidemic.'' These
substantial losses recently provoked a national response resulting in the
development of the "US Wheat and Barley Scab Initiative,'' a consortium of
scientists and agribusiness leaders working together to solve the scab
epidemic.
Stack says "Breeding for disease resistance is underway worldwide and soon
new cultivars with increased resistance to scab and developed by
conventional breeding methods will be available.''
