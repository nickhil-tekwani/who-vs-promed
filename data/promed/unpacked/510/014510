An infant and a young child living in southern Grey-Bruce are expected to make full recoveries from pertussis (whooping cough), a contagious bacterial respiratory illness, a Grey-Bruce Health Unit news release said Wed 13 Jun 2012.

The separate, lab-confirmed cases are not believed to be part of the outbreak in parts of southwestern Ontario, the health unit says. There are outbreaks in Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph, Perth, Oxford, Elgin-St. Thomas, Haldimand-Norfolk and the Windsor-Essex areas. People in the households of the local kids involved and high-risk contacts have been offered preventative treatment with antibiotics.

The release was issued to remind people that immunization is the best protection against whooping cough or pertussis, health unit spokesman Drew Ferguson said.

One to 3 deaths from pertussis occur each year in Canada, usually in infants too young to have begun their immunization and in partially immunized infants. The Ontario outbreaks occurred among people who were not immunized, typically among Mennonites, Ferguson said. Locally though, the health unit has had success bringing immunization clinics to local Mennonites, he said.

[Unlike most if the outbreaks that have been posted on ProMED, it seems that much of the pertussis burden in Ontario, Canada has been occurring in a religious cohort in the province that had not been immunized. - Mod.LL
