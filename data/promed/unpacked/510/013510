Chikungunya is no stranger to Indonesia. In 1779, an outbreak of
'knuckle fever' (presumably Chikungunya) was reported in the area of
present-day Jakarta.

The first cases of chikungunya in Indonesia were reported in 1973, in
Samarinda and Balikpapan, East Kalimantan. The disease then spread
to Kuala Tungkal (Jambi province) in 1980; and Yogyarkarta, Martapura
and Ternate in 1983.

After a hiatus of 20 years, 24 distinct outbreaks of probable
chikungunya were reported during 2001 to 2003.
- 8068 cases were reported in 2003, in 29 regencies/cities, of 9
provinces: Central Java, Yogyakarta, Banten, West Java, East Java,
Bali, West Nusa Tenggara, East Nusa Tenggara and Lampung.

Notable outbreaks:
1983 to 1984 - An outbreak was reported in Yogyakarta Province.
1998 to 1999 - An outbreak was reported in Yogyakarta Province, the
first Indonesian outbreak since 1984.
2001 - An outbreak (420 presumed cases) was reported in Bireun regency, Aceh.

[The report reflects a remarkable number of chikungunya (CHK)
outbreaks in Indonesia -- 21 in 2002-2003 alone. It would be
interesting to know if all of them were laboratory-confirmed cases.
One would hope that there is a repository of CHK virus isolates in
Indonesia or elsewhere, that would permit molecular sequence analysis
to establish the relative relationships not only of the Indonesian
viruses from various outbreaks but also those from Indian Ocean
island outbreaks and India. Such comparisons might give some clues as
to whether the same CHK strains are being spread within this broad
area, especially in the past 2 years, or if we are seeing a series of
unrelated outbreaks in isolated endemic foci. If CHK virus is being
spread mainly by infected travelers, there appear to be few
significant barriers to prevent its arrival in other areas of Asia
(or beyond) where _Aedes_ vectors are abundant and the local
populations have not been exposed to this virus recently or
previously (virgin soil).
