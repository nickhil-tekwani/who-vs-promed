REPORT ON THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA FOLLOWING
HURRICANE MITCH November 24, 1998
A Report of the PAHO Emergency Task Force on Hurricane Mitch
EL SALVADOR:
Cholera: According to information received on 23 November, the
epidemiological situation remains unchanged from that reported yesterday.
A total of six cases of cholera have been reported with one death. With
respect to the outbreak of diarrhea reported on 19 November in the San Juan
de Dios Hospital (Santa Ana, on the Guatemala border), an investigation
continues of the 15 cases that remain hospitalized. The Ministry of Health
continues executing its plan of disease prevention and control.
GUATEMALA:
Cholera: Information received today from the Health Management Information
System (SIGSA) updates the cholera situation before and after Hurricane
Mitch. Up to Week 43 (31 October), 1,965 suspected cases had been reported
nationally, 564 were confirmed, and 35 people died, a case-fatality rate of
1.8%. Up to Week 45 (14 November), 2,701 suspected cases were reported,
734 confirmed, and 38 people died, a case-fatality rate of 1.4%.
Consequently, for the first two weeks following Hurricane Mitch (1-14
November), the number of suspected cases of cholera nationwide reached 736
(327 in the first week following Hurricane Mitch and 409 in the second
week). Of these, 170 were confirmed (68 in the first week and 102 in the
second week.) Three people died (two in the first week, and one in the
second week.) The nationwide case-fatality rate for the first two weeks
following Hurricane Mitch was 0.4%.
Leptospirosis: No change has been reported in the situation since 23
November. The total number of cases to date is six, of which five have
been confirmed.
Dengue: No new information has been reported.
Malaria: Reports indicate the situation is stable.
NICARAGUA:
Cholera: No new information is available since 23 November. The Ministry
of Health has reported the occurrence of 335 cases of cholera, of which 301
have been confirmed.
Leptospirosis: On 23 November 22 additional cases were reported, raising
the Ministry of Health's figures to 286 suspected cases of leptospirosis
since 7 November, when they reported the first suspected case. 97.9% of
the cases are in Chinandega and Esteli (149 and 131 cases respectively.)
Of the 195 samples processed in laboratories through 23 November, 46 (33 in
Chinandega, 12 in Esteli and one in Madriz) tested positive for Leptospira
(23.6%). To date, a total of seven deaths have been reported (3 in
Chinandega and four in Esteli). The latest death occurred on 17 November.
The health authorities report that all suspected cases are hospitalized and
there are no serious cases at the moment. The Ministry of Health is taking
the following actions: strengthening medical services; household-level
focal control; carrying out environmental health campaigns, using
rodenticides; and identifying animals that are potential hosts. The
health authorities consider that the decline in the number of reported
cases in the last five days is the result of these activities.
Dengue: The Ministry of Health reports a rise in the number of reported
cases in the last two weeks.
Malaria: According to information from the Ministry of Health, the
situation is stable.
HONDURAS:
Cholera: There is no change in the situation as reported on 23 November.
The Emergency Operations Center of the Ministry of Health reports
irregularities detected in the daily reports of diseases under
surveillance. This has led to a suspected under-reporting. Up to 21
November, the Ministry of Health had reported 3 confirmed cases of cholera
and 11 suspected cases in Regions 1, 3 and 4.
Leptospirosis: On 23 November one suspected case of leptospirosis was
reported in Choloma-La Lima, one of the affected areas in the Department of
Cortes. The patient died and the samples collected are being processed.
To date, the total number of reported cases is five, and four deaths have
occurred.
Dengue: Up to 24 November, there is no new information. Up to 21
November, the Ministry of Health had reported 1,080 cases of classic
dengue, and had confirmed 15 cases of hemorrhagic dengue, which resulted in
the death of four people.
BELIZE:
There is no change in the situation, as reported on 23 November. To date,
five cases of cholera have been confirmed, resulting in one death. The 52
contacts in the five reported cases and the six suspected cases received
treatment. The authorities believe the outbreak has been controlled.
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS NOVEMBER 24, 1998
Epidemic activity of cholera remains in the five affected countries; of
leptospirosis in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala; and of hemorrhagic
dengue in Honduras, as reported on 23 November.
This report highlights three situations:
1. The decline in case-fatality rate from cholera reported in Guatemala in
Weeks 44 and 45 (1-14 November) with respect to the previous period
(pre-Mitch), could be the result of earlier diagnosis and an improved level
of care in diagnosed cases.
2. The situation reported in Nicaragua with respect to the outbreak of
leptospirosis in Chinandega and Esteli, with a decline in the number of
suspected cases beginning 19 November and the absence of deaths due to
this disease as of 17 November, suggests that the actions taken to control
the outbreak could be associated to these results.
3. The situation reported in Honduras regarding case-fatality rate from
leptospirosis (4 deaths and 5 reported cases) suggests problems in the
suspected diagnosis and/or the early diagnosis of these cases. These
considerations should be confirmed by the health authorities.
PAHO continues to recognize the efforts made by the affected countries to
control the occurrence of epidemics. The Organization also reiterates the
need to improve the efficiency of epidemiological surveillance systems
with regard to early detection, not only in the general population, but
particularly in shelters where conditions that favor the transmission and
outbreak of infectious diseases that have a potential to cause epidemics,
remain present.
PAHO considers that the recommendations put forth in the report of 23
November remain valid, and consequently reiterates the need to set them in
motion.
