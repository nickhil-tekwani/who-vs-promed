Dear Dr Blancou
Newcastle Disease in Sydney Region, New South Wales
Further to my previous reports, I am advising of the decision of New South
Wales to implement a vaccination program in the former Surveillance Zone
around Mangrove Mountain, that has been in place since April this year. The
V4 vaccine produced commercially from an endemic avirulent strain, will be
used. Approximately 70 commercial farms in this zone will be required to
vaccinate. There has been no disease problems detected, since the last known
cases in May this year.
The Newcastle Disease surveillance program within the Surveillance Zone has
detected low virulent viruses from a number of farms. No virulent virus has
been isolated. However, genetic sequence studies suggest that some isolates
are of the strain believed to be the progenitor type for the virulent virus
that caused the previous outbreaks. Therefore, a vaccination approach has
been adopted in an attempt to eliminate this low virulent progenitor strain.
Sampling and monitoring is continuing and movement restrictions continue to
be imposed within the Surveillance Zone.
This vaccinated zone will now be regarded as a Newcastle Disease Free Zone
with vaccination. A new Surveillance Zone has been declared encompassing the
Sydney region. I shall forward you a map as soon as possible.
The vaccination strategy will provide additional assurances against any
re-occurrence of clinical disease in the poultry production area. This
approach will allow time for an extensive survey to determine the types,
prevalence and distribution of ND viruses to be undertaken initially in the
Sydney region.
Standard operating procedures to ensure biosecurity are currently being
finalised for the application of V4 vaccine and movement controls over
product.
There is no evidence of virulent Newcastle disease since my report last
September. OIE principles of regionalisation are continuing to be applied.
The rest of Australia should be recognised as a virulent Newcastle disease
free zone.
I shall keep you informed of further developments.
Kind regards

BOB BIDDLE
Deputy Australian Chief Veterinary Officer
