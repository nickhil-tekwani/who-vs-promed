["Fowl typhoid in chickens and turkeys is caused by _S. enterica_ serovar Gallinarum biovar Gallinarum and is more often observed in the later growing period and in mature stock. Disease is often characterized by rapid spread with high morbidity and acute or subacute mortality. Red mites may be involved in the transmission of disease and persistence in poultry houses.

"Clinical signs in chicks and poults include anorexia, diarrhea, dehydration, weakness, and death. In mature birds, Pullorum disease is less severe but decreased egg production, poor hatchability, and some increased mortality may occur. Fowl typhoid is a more acute septicemic condition which mainly affects mature birds and may be particularly severe in commercial laying flocks." Source: OIE Terrestrial Manual 2020, Chapter 3.3.11 "Fowl typhoid and Pullorum disease" at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.03.11_FOWL_TYPHOID.pdf

"Fowl typhoid and pullorum disease are common in some countries of Central and South America, Africa, and Asia. These diseases have been eradicated from commercial poultry in many other nations with highly developed poultry industries, such as the US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, and most countries in Europe. Even in these countries, however, _Salmonella gallinarum_ and _Salmonella Pullorum_ may persist in backyard flocks, game birds, and wild birds.

"_Salmonella_ Gallinarum and _S._ Pullorum rarely cause clinical cases in people. In one report, these organisms accounted for only 26 out of more than 450,000 Salmonella isolated from humans in the US between 1982 and 1992. Self-limiting enteritis is thought to be the most common presentation, although other syndromes have been reported. Their threat to immunocompromised individuals is still unclear. A urinary tract infection caused by _S._ Gallinarum was reported in a kidney transplant patient in 2017, and it is possible that some infections might have been missed. Organisms identified only as group D _Salmonella_ have occasionally been recovered from people who were infected with HIV or had other immunosuppressive conditions."
