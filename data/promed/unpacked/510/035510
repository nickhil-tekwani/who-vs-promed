End of field activities sets stage for rinderpest eradication
-------------------------------------------------------------
An ambitious global effort that has brought rinderpest, a deadly cattle
plague, to the brink of extinction is ending all field activities, paving
the way for official eradication of the disease. It would be the 1st time
in history that humankind has succeeded in wiping out an animal disease in
the wild, and only the 2nd time, after smallpox in 1980, that a disease has
been eliminated thanks to human efforts.

Rinderpest does not affect humans directly, but its ability to cause swift,
massive losses of cattle and other hoofed animals has led to devastating
effects on agriculture for millennia, leaving famine and economic
devastation in its wake.

"The control and elimination of rinderpest has always been a priority for
the Organization since its early days in its mission to defeat hunger and
strengthen global food security," FAO director-general Jacques Diouf said,
as ministers, animal health experts, and partners gathered in Rome (13-14
Oct 2010) for a Global Rinderpest Eradication Symposium. The meeting got
under way as representatives from many of FAO's member countries prepared
to take part in the 15 October World Food Day 2010 observance, whose theme
is "United Against Hunger".

"The disease has affected Europe, Asia and Africa for centuries and has
caused widespread famine and decimated millions of animals, both domestic
and wild. In the 1880s, rinderpest caused losses of up to one million head
of cattle in Russia and central Europe," said Diouf.

When it entered Africa in the 19th century, it decimated millions of heads
of livestock and wildlife and triggered widespread famine. It is estimated
that in that pandemic alone, up to one-third of the human population of
Ethiopia died of starvation as a result. The last known outbreak of
rinderpest occurred in 2001 in Kenya.

A joint FAO/OIE announcement of global rinderpest eradication is expected
in mid-2011, pending a review of final official disease status reports from
a handful of countries to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

"We are confident that the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE will
officially recognize all remaining countries as free from the disease in
May 2011 and thus close on that day OIE Pathway activities for rinderpest
eradication. The OIE programme was launched back in 1989 and has been
extremely reliable in assessing the presence or absence of the virus in all
countries worldwide. It should serve future ventures in eradicating other
animal diseases," Dr Bernard Vallat, OIE director general declared.

Participants of the symposium discussed lessons learned from international
efforts to stamp out the disease, how to apply lessons learned to eradicate
other diseases, and reviewed what remains to be done before and after a
final declaration of eradication.

A global effort
---------------
FAO has spearheaded a coordinated, global effort to study the pattern and
nature of rinderpest, help farmers and veterinary services recognize and
control the disease, develop and implement vaccination campaigns and,
ultimately eradicate the disease within the framework of the OIE pathway.
That effort has involved a broad alliance of international partners such as
the OIE, IAEA and donors, most recently under the Global Rinderpest
Eradication Programme (GREP).

GREP was launched in 1994 as a global coordination mechanism that would
allow the international community to jointly undertake rinderpest control
in a systematic and comprehensive way. It was the decisive, final push in a
decades-long campaign of scientific research, field surveillance and
vaccination of animals in the field.

"The extraordinary success of this programme would not have been possible
without the united efforts and determined commitment of the governments of
all affected and exposed countries, without the African Union's
Inter-African Bureau on Animal Resources and the responsible regional
organizations in Asia and Europe, without the donor agencies committed to
this endeavor," said FAO director-general Jacques Diouf.

Special gratitude was expressed to the European Union and other major
donors as well as dedicated professionals in research institutions and
bilateral and multilateral development agencies. "Together we have defeated
rinderpest. Together we are stronger. Together we will defeat hunger,"
concluded Jacques Diouf.

Devastating history
-------------------
Caused by a virus and spread by contact and contaminated materials,
rinderpest has destroyed countless millions of cattle, buffalo, yaks and
their wild relatives, with mortality rates in extreme cases reaching close
to 100 per cent.

Many centuries after it was 1st seen in Asia and Europe, rinderpest reached
its height in the 1920s. At one time, the disease's footprint extended from
Scandinavia to the Cape of Good Hope and from the Atlantic shore of Africa
to the Philippine archipelago, with one outbreak reported in Brazil and
another in Australia.

In the early 1980s, rinderpest was still ravaging livestock herds around
the world, with devastating epidemics hitting South Asia, the Middle East,
and Africa. Losses in Nigeria in the 1980s totalled USD 2 billion. A 1994
outbreak in northern Pakistan wiped out more than 50 000 cattle and buffalo
before being brought under control with help from the FAO and its partners.

[The following summary is derived from chapter 2.1.15. "Rinderpest" of
OIE's "Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals
2010", last updated 26 Aug 2010, available at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_summry.htm>.

"Classical rinderpest is an acute, viral disease of domestic cattle,
buffaloes and yaks characterised by high morbidity and mortality rates.
Sheep, goats, pigs and wild ungulates may also be affected. Clinically this
form of the disease is characterised by pyrexia, the progressive
development of shallow erosions on the gums, tongue, cheeks and hard
palate, together with serous or mucopurulent ocular and nasal discharges.
Alimentary tract involvement is marked by the development of diarrhoea or
dysentery, leading to severe dehydration and depression. Rinderpest
conforming to this description has not been seen since 2001 (Pibor,
Southern Sudan).

"A milder form of the disease, with the potential to regain classical
characteristics, used to occur in association with endemic situations,
latterly in East Africa; it has not been positively diagnosed since 1997
(Tanzania) and could have died out, in which case wild-type rinderpest
virus may no longer exist. Based on historical virus collections, 3
genetically distinct lineages of the virus have been recognised as causal
agents of rinderpest disease in Africa and Asia. The Food and Agriculture
Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) launched a Global Rinderpest
Eradication Programme (GREP) in 1992, calling for eradication of the virus
by the year 2010. The success of this programme may be judged by the fact
that 2 of the 3 rinderpest lineages have now assuredly been eradicated and
the 3rd might well have joined them.

"Identification of the agent:
-----------------------------
Clinical confirmation of classical rinderpest is based on the finding of
individual or small groups of animals showing pyrexia, inappetance,
depression, shallow erosions of the upper and lower lip and gum, erosions
or blunting of the cheek papillae, serous or mucopurulent ocular discharges
and/or nasal discharges, diarrhoea, recumbency and possibly death.
Laboratory confirmation is based on demonstrating the presence of the
virus, virus-specific RNA or precipitating antigens in samples from the
spleen, lymph nodes, or ocular or nasal secretions of acutely infected animals.

"It is particularly important to isolate the virus if a geographical
extension or significant animal health deterioration has occurred.
Following the successes of global eradication, rinderpest-free countries
may now confirm the presence of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) in sheep
or goats based on the clinical appearance of affected animals and the
presence of precipitating antigens, even though both the clinical signs and
the virus-induced antigens are common to both viruses.

"In cases where rinderpest is suspected, post-mortem examinations should
pay particular attention to the abomasum, which may be highly engorged or
show a grey discoloration; to the Peyer's patches, which may show lymphoid
necrosis; and to the development of linear engorgement and blackening of
the crests of the folds of the caecum, colon and rectum. The principal
differential diagnoses are PPR in sheep and goats, and bovine viral
diarrhoea/mucosal disease and malignant catarrhal fever in cattle;
differentiation of these diseases requires the use of appropriate
laboratory methods.

"Serological tests:
-------------------
The OIE has developed a set of Recommended Standards for Epidemiological
Surveillance for Rinderpest (the 'OIE Pathway') that governs the actions of
Member Countries wishing to demonstrate that they have achieved freedom
from infection. To this end, a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) has been described to determine the presence of rinderpest
antibodies in animals that have been infected with field virus or received
rinderpest vaccine. An indirect ELISA has also been described. Whatever
test is used it should be sensitive with respect to the lineage of virus
likely to be present and be highly specific. Neutralising antibody
estimations may be used for the same purpose. Member Countries may wish to
seek expert advice from an OIE Reference Laboratory or the GREP Secretariat
with regard to the selection of the test most appropriate for their purpose."]
