UNDIAGNOSED DEATHS, WILD YAK - CHINA (QINGHAI): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (03)

What we have here are aged work animals, left to die from starvation
and exposure at various points during a difficult winter.
While most Tibetans will butcher and consume an animal that dies from
natural causes, it is considered contrary to Buddhist teachings to
actually bring about that death by an act of commission. Acts of
omission, on the other hand, are considered acceptable.
Thus farmers running out of fodder toward the end of a harsh winter
will lead their aged male yaks out to die like this, saving the
females and young. Usually the animals will be left at a remote
location, from which they cannot make their way home.
If this had been an exceptionally harsh winter, like the winter of
1997-1998, the yak carcasses would have been scavenged for meat soon
afterward. That apparently was not done. This was simply the result
of a local fodder crisis.

[Merritt Clifton refers to the 2nd posting in this thread, according
to which all (9) dead yaks were male, had no gun wounds nor signs of
infectious disease, some died 1 or 2 months earlier, and all showed
reduced fat deposits. The 1st posting in the thread had a different
description. - Mod.AS]
