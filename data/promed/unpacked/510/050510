Afghanistan: Mysterious Disease Killing Children in Badakhshan Province
---------------------------------------------------
More than 300 children have died of an unidentified disease in the northern
Afghan province of Badakhshan within the last month, the Pakistan-based
Afghan Islamic Press reported yesterday. Shamsur Rehman, the province's
deputy governor, said the malady appeared to be a respiratory disease that
began with flu-like symptoms and then stopped children from breathing.
The number of casualties may be higher, Rehman said, but getting exact
numbers was difficult because of the remoteness of some parts of the
province. "Relief organizations and government officials are providing
succor to the people in several disease-hit areas, but there are many
places which cannot be accessed without helicopters," Rehman said. He
appealed to the World Health Organization and other aid groups to help
avoid what he called a "human catastrophe".

UNICEF launched yesterday a USD 238 000 program to supply and train staff
in maternal health facilities in 13 sites across Afghanistan. The UN agency
is providing office equipment and maternal health training materials to
midwifery schools and obstetric care centers in Herat, Jalalabad, Kabul,
Kandahar, and Mazar-e Sharif. The project is funded by contributions from
Belgium and Japan.
