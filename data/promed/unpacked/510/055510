I can share with you that I have personally seen front-end loaders leave
chicken houses, drive across the pasture to a large, long feed trough, dump
the litter, and return until the feeder is filled. The farmer then adds
some molasses across the top of the litter and turns the cows into the area
where the feeder is located.
I live in south Georgia and this is a very common practice. It's not
hearsay--I saw it.

[The above references indicate a botulism outbreak of tremendous magnitude
in cattle because of feeding litter that actually contained dead birds.
They also references litter as a cheap source of protein. I would encourage
our readers to look at the suggested references. - Mod.TG
