A tick carrying a rare disease infected a Sarasota-area man while he was
clearing brush in the southern part of the county, spreading the 1st case
of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever seen here [in the county] since 2005.

The man, who is 52 and lives in Sarasota County, was sick for more than a
week but has fully recovered. He did not realize he had been bitten until
he came down with flu-like symptoms and went to see his doctor, said county
epidemiologist Scott Pritchard. Although he was bitten in September 2009,
health officials did not announce it until Tuesday [3 Nov 2009]. Testing to
confirm the case took several weeks.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever, usually signaled by high fever and a red,
blotchy rash that spreads from the hands and feet, is the worst of all
tickborne bacterial illnesses. If not treated with antibiotics, it kills 20
per cent of people who contract it [and are not treated early - Mod.LL].
While named for the Western mountain region where it was discovered, more
than half of cases occur in the south eastern USA. Even so, only 19 cases
were reported in Florida in 2008. And only 70 per cent of those involved
bites that actually occurred in the state.

It is mostly children under 15 who contract the disease, although the
previous reported case in Sarasota involved a 50 year old man.

[It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to minimize
morbidity and mortality. This is particularly true in areas such as the
midwestern USA, where the disease is uncommon. The time frame in this case
is not clear.

When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human,
she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy
vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around
on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes
makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed.

After attaching, it generally takes as many as 24 hours to activate and
transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice daily
tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that
attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick
exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is
generally nonspecific, fever, muscle pains, headache (but the headache is
usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness,
initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial
and purpuric involving the palms and soles as well as spreading proximally
to the truck. Purpura usually are not seen before the 6th day of illness.
The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is
begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people with
compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer,
even if no tick bite is known.

The female _Dermacentor variabilis_ (the American dog tick), a common
vector for this infection, can be seen at
