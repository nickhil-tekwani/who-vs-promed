The Department of Health (DOH) 5 Bicol in southern Luzon reported Saturday [11 Jun 2022] on 7 Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases in the region from January to the end of April [2022].

Camarines Sur had 4 cases (one each in the towns of Bula, San Jose, Lagonoy, and Minalabas); Sorsogon had 2, (one each in Sorsogon City and Gubat town); and one in Manito, Albay.

No JE cases were reported in the same period last year [2021].

JE is the most important cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. About 68 000 clinical cases are reported annually. It usually occurs in rural or agricultural areas, often associated with rice farming.

JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Culex_ species mosquitoes, particularly _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_.

Most JE virus infections are mild (fever and headache) or without apparent symptoms, but approximately 1 in 250 infections results in severe disease characterized by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, and death. The case-fatality rate can be as high as 30% among those with disease symptoms.

There is a protective vaccine against Japanese encephalitis virus.

To prevent the spread of JE, DOH-5 has urged the public to minimize outdoor activities during cooler hours at dusk and dawn when mosquitos are active, use mosquito repellent on exposed skin, stay in air-conditioned or well-screened rooms, use mosquito nets, and get vaccinated, especially before traveling to areas where Japanese encephalitis is endemic.

"Follow the 4S strategy -- Search and destroy mosquito breeding sites, use Self-protection measures, Seek early consultation, and Say yes to fogging when there is an impending outbreak or a hotspot. Everyone is reminded to keep the environment free of mosquito breeding sites, especially with the onset of the rainy season," it said.

[There have been sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) on Luzon Island in the past. The cases tend to be individual and not in clusters, as is the situation in the report above. The 3 affected provinces are on the east side of Luzon Island. Cases of JE occur sporadically in various parts of the Philippines, including Luzon Island.

The report does not provide descriptions of the specific ecological situations where Japanese encephalitis virus might be transmitted in the 3 affected provinces that presumably have abundant populations of _Culex_ vector mosquitoes. Ardeid water bird hosts such as herons are involved in the maintenance of JE virus and pigs serve as amplifying hosts. Presumably, the 7 infected individuals l had not been vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis. - Mod.TY
