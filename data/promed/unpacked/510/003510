During epidemiological week [EW] 17 2008 [20-26 Apr 2008], the office of
the director general of epidemiology (DGE) reported 138 cases of classical
dengue; 73 per cent of these cases were reported by 16 regional health
directorates.

The reported national cumulative total [of dengue cases] was 6409, of which
1126 were laboratory confirmed; 4070 were probable [cases] and 1213 were
discarded.

Up to the current week [EW week 17], 25 DHF cases have been reported, 9 of
which were confirmed. No deaths have been reported due to [DHF].

The national cumulative incidence is 18.67 dengue cases per 100 000
inhabitants. The risk of infection is greatest in the eastern and north
eastern tropical Amazon drainage departments [state/province equivalents].

Dengue fever in East Kalimantan has killed 10 people each month in 2008. Up
to today [28 Apr 2008], dengue has caused 41 fatalities. The local
government up to now has not determined whether there was an extraordinary
incident in this case. "Mostly, patients died because they were handled too
late," said Parmono Kepala Sub Bidang Penanggulangan of Infectious Diseases
in the Health Service of East Kalimantan.

According to the data of the Health Service, during 2008 up until today [28
Apr 2008], 2396 dengue patients have been attended to. Of this number, 41
people died. Balikpapan city was recorded as the area having the most
dengue patients, with 865, 13 of whom died. This area was followed by
Samarinda in 2nd place, with 743 patients and 10 deaths, and the Kutai
Kartanegara region, with 231 patients and 8 deaths.

Malaysia has been fighting the dengue scourge for more than 4 decades, yet
the number of cases is increasing. "We have been fogging and fogging for
the last 30 years, and if the number (of cases) is steadily increasing over
the years, surely something is not right?" said Profesor Dr Sazaly Abu
Bakar, director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbo-virus Research and
Reference (Dengue Fever/Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever) at Universiti Malaya.

Dr Sazaly said Malaysians had grown complacent because the dengue problem
had been prevalent in the country for so long. For example, the current
vector-controlling measures were adopted from an American model developed
some 30 years ago, and it [fogging] was only effective in killing the adult
mosquitoes but not the larvae, said Dr Sazaly, who also heads the
Department of Medical Microbiology at Universiti Malaya. "No one knows the
answers, because we have not done any studies. We need to study these
factors and devise a strategy based on it."

Dr Sazaly said one of the more effective ways to control the problem was
for the authorities to take daily and weekly samples of mosquitoes to find
those carrying the dengue virus and reduce their population without
disturbing the ecological system. "There should be continuous monitoring
and surveillance, and only then can we predict and preempt an outbreak
before it occurs. Right now, we do not even know the genetics of our
mosquitoes here. The fire-fighting methods, such as fogging an area when a
case is reported, are ineffective."

In Malaysia, the number of dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic fever cases
has risen from 518 cases in 1973 to 45 856 suspected cases last year
[2007]. "The danger is that for every patient confirmed with dengue, 3 more
go undetected because it is asymptomatic."

Dr Sazaly said there was a need to come up with a faster and more accurate
method of diagnosing dengue. "We are still relying on old lab tests which
require you to have a fever for at least 5 days before you are confirmed to
be positive for dengue. By then, your condition may be severe, and by the
time you go to hospital, it may be too late. We have to improve not only
our vector-control methods but also ensure early detection of the
infection, like coming up with a cheap self-diagnostic kit."

Dr Sazaly said although the technology was available now, it was expensive
and could only be done at referral centres such as the University Malaya
Medical Centre and the Kuala Lumpur Hospital. "We need to come up with our
own diagnostic kit so that we can bring the cost down."

He said of the 45 856 suspected dengue cases last year [2007], only 14 354
were confirmed positive by laboratory test. "Because of the weaknesses in
our detection system, we could not positively identify the remaining 33 000
as dengue cases. So, these people who are walking out there could have been
infected and not know it. People need to know their dengue status. If you
have had dengue fever before, then you have to be careful, because the 2nd
time you get it, the chances are high that it will develop into
haemorrhagic fever. But then again, not everyone who has a 2nd infection
will die. We need to study the factors which contribute to dengue
haemorrhagic fever and [determine those] who are more susceptible."

Those who are obese, diabetic or over 60 years old are considered to be in
the high-risk group, as they have a higher chance of developing dengue
haemorrhagic fever. "We need to study why this group is predisposed to it,
and, to do this, we need to study their genetic background. If we know that
not everyone will die of dengue, at least we can focus on the type of
patients we need to manage. If we can spend some money to research this, we
can develop drugs to prevent these deaths. And if we have drugs to manage
dengue, we won't have to vaccinate 29 million people."

He said it was not cost-effective to develop a vaccine for a large number
of people when only a certain percentage of them were at real risk of dying
from dengue. Dr Sazaly said the proper management of dengue patients was
another area which was often overlooked by doctors. As there is no blanket
treatment that is suitable for all dengue patients, doctors need to treat
each patient based on the symptoms. Dr Sazaly said a multi-pronged approach
was needed to tackle the dengue problem, including funding more research by
local scientists."It is hyper-endemic here, and yet we are not putting our
research efforts into it."

[This article raises several important points, some of which are
controversial. Dengue virus mosquito vector control is notoriously
difficult to accomplish. As this article indicates, adulticiding is
inadequate for long term vector mosquito control. Elimination of _Aedes_
breeding sites, or treatment of those sites with larvacides, requires
active public collaboration. Public education and motivation, supported by
governmental monitoring, is difficult and expensive to maintain long term.

Failure to achieve the required level of sustained public participation
suggests that permanent, long term community-based vector control is not
possible. Cost/benefit analyses are similarly difficult and expensive to
carry out.

As the world's commonest mosquitoborne virus disease, with a high morbidity
rate and significant mortality during outbreaks, dengue control and
prevention is justified on social and economic grounds and is needed
urgently. Given the inadequacy of vector control efforts, the obvious
dengue prevention alternative is development of vaccines, several of which
are undergoing clinical trials.

It is difficult to see how home diagnosis of dengue infection would
substitute for vector control and vaccination. Although early home
diagnosis of dengue may motivate some dengue virus infected patients to
seek early medical attention, it is not clear how it would prevent
human-to-human virus transmission. More rapid diagnosis in hospitals and
health centers would be an obvious benefit to physicians in providing
timely supportive treatment. Home diagnosis also brings the risk of
increased failure to report dengue cases, especially clinically mild ones.
Accurate dengue case statistics, already difficult, would become even more
difficult to achieve if home-diagnosed cases did not enter the health system.

The studies of dengue pathogenesis needed to improve patient treatment
mentioned in this report are hampered by lack of an adequate animal model.
