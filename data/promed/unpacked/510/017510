In a follow-up on the leptospirosis situation in New Caledonia, the Department of Health and Social Affairs is now reporting 190 cases including 3 deaths through 18 May 2021. This compares with a total of 69 cases in all of 2020.

Leptospirosis is widespread throughout the world, and of which there are several varieties. It is usually contracted during activity in connection with urine-contaminated fresh water or contaminated animals. Incubation, of varying duration, can range from 2 to 21 days.

The most common symptoms are high fever (usually over 39 deg C [102 deg F]), muscle, joint, abdominal pain, and severe headache. The disease can get worse a few days after the 1st signs and spread to the meninges, liver, kidneys, lungs, etc.

Treatment is based on taking antibiotics. To control and prevent infections, it is necessary to limit the proliferation of rodents. For this, it is recommended to keep food in closed boxes, to eliminate household garbage around homes and to collect fallen fruit from trees. In the workplace, personal protective equipment (gloves, boots, coveralls or protective clothing, splash goggles, etc.) must be worn.

In the event of a wound, wash with plenty of drinking water and soap (for 30 seconds), disinfect with an antiseptic solution, protect the wound with an impermeable bandage.

New Caledonia, with a population of about 270 000 residents, is a French archipelago currently governed under the Noumea Accord. It is located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, south of Vanuatu, about 1210 km (750 mi) east of Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia). Noumea is its capital and largest city. The archipelago is divided into 3 provinces:

- South Province: Provincial capital: Noumea. Population: 203 142
- North Province: Provincial capital: Kone. Population: 49 912
- Loyalty Islands: Provincial capital: Lifou. Population: 18 353

New Caledonia is further divided into 33 communes (municipalities).

The initial news article from Outbreak News Today on 22 Feb 2021 reported a total of 80 cases in New Caledonia from 1 Jan to 21 Feb 2021, whereas there was a total of only 69 cases and 4 deaths in all of 2020 (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/new-caledonia-reports-spike-in-leptospirosis-in-early-2021/). At the time, the communes in New Caledonia reporting the most cases included Ponerihouen (North Province) with 11, and 6 each in Paita (a suburb of the city of Noumea in the South Province) and Poindimie (North Province).

Leptospirosis in New Caledonia is thought to have been imported with boat rats during the 19th century (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242886). Outbreaks of leptospirosis in New Caledonia are associated with heavy rainfall and flooding (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02310.x), with an annual peak in March-April during its hot rainy season (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242886).

Human activities that have placed patients at increased risk include contact with rats or domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and dogs), walking barefoot in water or mud, swimming in rivers, gardening or farming and working in piggeries (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242886). The diagnosis of leptospirosis in New Caledonia has been confirmed by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but since 2010 PCR has been the usual confirmatory diagnostic method. - Mod.ML
