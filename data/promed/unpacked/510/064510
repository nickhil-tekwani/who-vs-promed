A mystery pasture toxin has been blamed for the deaths of nearly 40 cattle
on 2 properties at East Gippsland in Victoria. Pathologist Ian Jerret says
very little is known about the fungal toxin, which affects the livers of
cattle when ingested off the pasture.
He says understanding the toxin is like finding a needle in a haystack
because it's only present for a short period of time in small localized
areas, when the climatic conditions are just right.
"Previously when we tried to investigate these outbreaks the actual signs
in the cattle disappeared fairly quickly and their condition didn't
re-occur even when other animals such as sheep were run on the pasture soon
after. The sheep didn't become ill and had no changes in the blood to
indicate liver damage."
"It's something that comes and goes very quickly, which makes it virtually
impossible to get a handle on it and positively identify the fungus or the
toxin."

[It is suspected this is a condition known as bovine acute hepatopathy or
bovine acute liver necrosis. It has occurred regularly in autumn in
Tasmania, Victoria, and South Australia over the past few years. Some
originally thought it was acute facial eczema but this has been eliminated
as the cause. Retrospective and current epidemiological studies show that
the pasture species rough [bristly] dogtail (_Cynosurus echinatus_) has
been associated with all cases. The current feeling is that this is the
cause, either by itself or in association with a fungus. No more is known
at this moment. A few people think it may be due to toxic algae, but this
hasn't been proven either.
The Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organization Plant Toxins
Unit is now involved. ProMED-mail is grateful to Dr Jeremy Allen for
providing us with this information. - Mod.TG]
