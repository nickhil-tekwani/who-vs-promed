Dominican government officials released more-detailed autopsy results on Thursday [6 Jun 2019] for 3 American tourists who died at adjacent beach resorts owned by the same hotel company during the last week of May 2019.

All 3 victims experienced eerily similar symptoms and internal trauma before their deaths, according to a news release from Dominican authorities. Pathologists said autopsies showed the 3 had internal hemorrhaging, pulmonary edema, and enlarged hearts.

Toxicology reports are pending [These are likely to be the most interesting. - Mod.TG].

A U.S. State Department official said authorities have not yet established a connection between the 30 May 2019 deaths of 49-year-old CAD, and 63-year-old NEH, both of Prince George's County, MD, and the death on 25 May 2019 of 41-year-old MSW of Pennsylvania.

The FBI is providing Dominican law enforcement with "technical assistance with the toxicology reports," the State Department official said.

MSW had just checked into the Luxury Bahia Principe Bouganville, in the town of San Pedro de Macoris, and was taking pictures from her room balcony when she started to feel ill.

Less than 2 hours later, she was dead, local authorities said.

The bodies of CAD and HEH were found inside their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana after relatives grew concerned because they had not checked out of the resort.

The hotels are located next to each other on the island's southern coast, about 60 miles from the tourist-heavy Punta Cana area.

Dominican authorities initially did not run toxicology tests for MSW because there were no signs of violence, said Ramon Brito, a spokesman for the National Police's special tourism unit. After the Maryland couple was found, investigators ordered a set of tests to determine whether anything the 3 Americans consumed may have led to their deaths, Brito said.

As authorities investigate the unexplained deaths of 3 Americans at a resort in the Dominican Republic, a Colorado couple who stayed at the same facility last year [2018] said they became violently ill after being exposed to what they suspect were insecticides spread through the air conditioning system.

KK, 29, and her boyfriend TS, 33, filed a lawsuit earlier this year [2019] against the owners of Grand Bahia Principe Hotel La Romana, blaming them for causing their sickness in June 2018.

In an interview with CNN, KK said the recent deaths of a Maryland couple and a Pennsylvania woman within days of each other at the same Dominican Republic hotel complex made her angry and sad.

"My blood boiled. It made me want to scream. It made me want to cry," KK said. "There's something going on. What happened to us may be related to what happened to them."

Last month [May 2019], ENH, 63 [reported by other sources as NEH - Mod.TG] and CAD, 49, were found unresponsive in their hotel room at the resort in La Romana. Authorities in the Dominican Republic said a preliminary autopsy found the couple suffered respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, caused by excess lung fluid. CAD also suffered a cerebral edema. Five days earlier, 41-year-old MSW died in her room with her husband nearby. [It is unclear whether her husband died or survived. - Mod.TG]. The couples checked in on the same day: 25 May 2019.

According to the Attorney General's Office of the Dominican Republic, a preliminary autopsy on MSW showed she suffered from a heart attack, pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. Toxicology results are pending, and the deaths remain under investigation by authorities in the Dominican Republic.

Jay McDonald, a spokesman for the MSW family, said they were working with authorities in the United States to gather more information.

"Our goal here is answers. We want to understand what happened," he said, adding that the couple was in the Dominican Republic to celebrate their 9th wedding anniversary.

A spokeswoman for the hotel would not comment on KK and TS's allegations, citing the pending litigation. She said the deaths of ENH [or NEH], CAD and MSW were isolated events and that there "are no indications of any correlation between these 2 unfortunate incidents."

Tourism Minister Francisco Garcia sought to downplay the deaths when speaking to reporters. "In the last 5 years, over 30 million tourists have visited the Dominican Republic, but this is the 1st time the international media report such an alarming situation. ... These are isolated incidents, and the Dominican Republic is a safe destination" [One has to wonder whether they are isolated, or whether others from other countries have simply not been reported or not picked up by news agencies as something possibly being amiss. - Mod.TG].

The recent deaths have prompted others who vacationed in the Dominican Republic to come forward with their own bad experience at the Bahia resort.

For KK, a massage therapist, and TS, an ambulance director, their vacation last year [2018] was supposed to be a relaxing getaway. They said they work relentlessly during Colorado's long ski tourist season and had been "excited about some beach time" when they booked their trip to Bahia. "We'd never been out of the country together."

On the 6th day of the couple's 13-day vacation, KK said she woke to a pounding headache. She assumed she was dehydrated, so at breakfast she drank water and tomato juice hoping that would help. It didn't.

When the couple returned to their room, they were hit with an overwhelming "chemical smell, like someone had painted the walls," she said.

They looked around, trying to find the source of the smell, discovered nothing and called the front desk for help. They wondered whether it was cleaning solution, but it appeared housekeeping had not visited.

While they waited for a reply from the front desk, they got a housekeeper's attention and asked her to come into the room. She walked in, waved her hand over her nose in disgust and immediately walked out, KK said.

With still no reply from the front desk, she called several more times. Eventually a bellhop and a hotel manager arrived with what they told the couple was an "air cleaner," a contraption about the size of a space heater, KK said.

She and her boyfriend repeatedly asked the manager to identify the source of the smell. It was difficult to communicate, she said. The couple does not speak Spanish, and some employees didn't seem to understand them.

The manager, whose name KK did not recall, upgraded the couple to a luxury room where they stayed the following night. But KK said she began to feel worse, and TS got sick, too. They endured intense stomach cramping and diarrhea. She had blood in her stool. His eyes wouldn't stop watering. They awoke to TS drooling a lot and a sweat-soaked bed.

"I had sopped his chest up (with drool)," KK said. "I was sweating so hard my eyes were tearing. My vision was blurred. ... My head was getting dizzy."

KK said she thought back on what she had seen days earlier: A maintenance person spraying palm plants that covered air conditioning units just outside their room.

"I wondered if someone sprayed our unit," she told CNN. "They are always constantly out there taking care of the plants. We saw them out there with bug sprayers."

The couple grew angrier as their symptoms worsened. KK said her stomach cramps were so bad it felt like "chainsaws going through my insides."

KK said she went to the front desk and demanded to know what was going on. "We asked for paperwork, for everything and they refused to give anything to us."

A couple days later, the couple decided to cut their vacation short and fly home at an extra cost of USD 600.

The flight home was painful, KK said. When they arrived at a stopover in a New York airport, they raced to the bathroom.

On their final flight home to Denver, KK said she was buckled over from the pain of stomach cramps.

They spent the next several days at home, drinking water and juice, and their symptoms began to ease. They were examined by their respective family doctors who, according to medical records KK provided, suspected the couple had been exposed to organophosphates.

Organophosphates are man-made chemicals typically found in pesticides, such as ant and roach spray. They can be absorbed through the skin, inhaled or eaten. Exposure can cause increased saliva, tear production, diarrhea, nausea, sweating, confusion and other symptoms, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information. About 3 million people worldwide are exposed to organophosphates every year, accounting for 300 000 deaths, the NCBI reports. Exposure to organophosphates can cause respiratory problems or failure, said Dana Boyd Barr, an Emory University professor of exposure science and environmental health. She's studied organophosphates for 30 years. Typically, those who are poisoned by organophosphates seize or salivate excessively, she said.

KK and TS's attorney, DC, and a Florida-based lawyer who often works with him, JU, told CNN that in the Dominican Republic, there is no discovery process or jury trial. When a lawsuit is filed, it's up to a judge to decide when a hearing happens, during which both sides present arguments. Then the judge renders a decision. It's possible the hotel could settle with the couple, Urban said.

KK became emotional this week reflecting on the people who have died. More than winning the suit, she said she wants to know what made them sick.

"Maybe that will help them," she said. "If talking about what happened to us helps find out what happened to those people -- God bless their families -- they deserve answers."

[It is unclear whether these 2 incidents are related in some way. The symptoms of the Colorado couple very much seem like organophosphates. It could have been organophosphates with some other toxic component as well. The Colorado couple did not seem to have evidence of pulmonary edema. They are lucky to be alive.

The typical toxidrome in organophosphate (OP) poisoning comprises salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastric cramps, emesis (SLUDGE) symptoms.

The 3 deceased all had similar pathology. Pathologists said autopsies showed the 3 had internal hemorrhaging, pulmonary edema and enlarged hearts. Pulmonary edema can cause death without immediate treatment. There are substances which may be so rapidly acting that the victim may not make it to treatment. We do not know whether any of these individuals tried to reach treatment of whether language was a barrier preventing help from arriving.

A number of things could cause pulmonary edema: ammonia, nitrogen dioxide, chlorine, phosgene, sulfur dioxide. Any of these could also cause hemorrhage, especially if associated with some pulmonary condition, including damage due to smoking. Pulmonary edema may also be associated with isocynate, Trimellitic anhydride, some pesticides, and even crack cocaine, and some drugs, such as methotrexate, prophylthiourocil, haloperidol.

Hemorrhages may be associated with a number of things, including trauma, perhaps from resuscitation attempts.

I am unsure where phosgene may have come from, unless it was being used as a fumigant in the rooms regarding insects or some mix up in chemicals. A number of articles are available on the internet, but the inference from all the articles is that the deaths were very rapid, which screams phosgene to me.

Phosgene has a pleasant odor of newly mown hay or green corn, but its odor may not be noticed by all people exposed. The vapors of chlorinated solvents exposed to high temperatures have been known to produce phosgene. Chlorinated solvents are chlorine-containing chemicals that are typically used in industrial processes to dissolve or clean other materials, such as in paint stripping, metal cleaning, and dry cleaning. If phosgene gas is released into the air, people may be exposed through skin contact or eye contact. They may also be exposed by breathing air that contains phosgene. If phosgene liquid is released into water, people may be exposed by touching or drinking water that contains phosgene. If phosgene liquid comes into contact with food, people may be exposed by eating the contaminated food.

During or immediately after exposure to dangerous concentrations of phosgene, the following signs and symptoms may develop: coughing, burning sensation in the throat or eyes, watery eyes, blurred vision, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath and even nausea and vomiting. Pulmonary edema may develop in as little as 2 hours

We will look forward to the results of the investigation. Regardless of the outcome, if you feel ill while traveling, seek medical attention. - Mod.TG
