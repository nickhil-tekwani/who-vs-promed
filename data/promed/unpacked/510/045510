Citrus fruit declines in Tamenglong leading to losses
-----------------------------------------------------
In order to promote orange farmers in the district, an 'Orange
Festival' [has been held] in Tamenglong for the past few years.
However, some are nervous over the declining citrus fruits.

An unknown disease of oranges has led to many farms being abandoned in
the district and many farmers have lost hundreds of thousands of
rupees. The disease first struck in 2008/2009 [ProMED-mail post
20081221.4020] and till today it continues to cause panic in poor
farmers. Some orange farmers revealed that the district administration
has done nothing to identify and control the disease.

The disease [starts] with the setting in of mildew on the plants
resulting in rotting of tertiary small roots, a source said. For 2
years the orange plants have been completely destroyed by the unknown
disease just before harvest. A farmer said he had cultivated oranges
on 4 acres [1.6 ha], but due to the disease the plants have dried out.

The very poor cultivators are surviving by working on other farms.
However, the desire for orange plantations has not been lost. A farmer
said, "I am preparing a nursery of orange saplings to be planted after
the unknown disease has dissipated."

[A number of diseases and pathogens of citrus are known to occur in
India, including tristeza, greening (huanglongbing), canker,
nematodes, and a range of fungi, viruses, and viroids. Multifactorial
'dieback' complexes which may also include additional environmental
factors have also been reported. It is thought that combinations of
various pathogens may have contributed to the general decline of
citrus health in the region due to accumulation of parasitic pathogens
in old orchards over time. Extensive harvest failures have led to
citrus replanting programmes (ProMED-mail post no. 20080130.0375), but
these need to be linked to ongoing crop monitoring to prevent
reinfections.

The situation in Manipur does not appear to have improved since the
new disease was reported in 2008 (ProMED-mail post 20081221.4020).
Based on the description of symptoms above, a fungal "mildew" (for
example, powdery mildew is affecting oranges in Bhutan -- ProMED-mail
post 20091122.4015) and/or root rot may be one of the factors causing
the problems. Conclusive diagnosis of the pathogen(s) is urgently
needed and it is unfortunate that this is still unavailable.
