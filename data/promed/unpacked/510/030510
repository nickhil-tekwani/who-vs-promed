Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome versus Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome
---------------------------------------------------
[Dr. Brian Hjelle has sent the following comment to correct and expand the
Moderator's statement in the preceding report in this thread. ProMED-mail
welcomes this clarification - Mod.CP]
This commentary concerns the use of the term "hantavirus cardiopulmonary
syndrome (HCPS)" in lieu of "hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS)". I would
like to clarify that while I have found it necessary at times to explain
this nomenclature, such as in a previous post to ProMED-mail, I did not
myself coin the term "hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome" as suggested in
the preceding post headed "Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - USA (WV, VA ex
WV) (02)". In fact this term was originally adopted by clinicians who were
caring for patients with HCPS at the University of New Mexico Health
Sciences Center -- which remains by far the largest referral center in
North America for patients with hantavirus diseases. Clinicians at referral
centers were concerned because some of the primary care providers from whom
they received referrals displayed a less than thorough degree of awareness
that mortality due to HCPS is nearly always due to cardiac insufficiency.
This deficiency in understanding of the pathogenesis of HCPS was often
manifest as a failure to support cardiac function with inotropes and other
cardioactive drugs, and/or a failure to understand the advantages of
referring patients with HCPS to a center that offers adult extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In contrast to mechanical ventilation, which
is available at any referral center, ECMO offers the distinct advantage of
supporting patients whose cardiac function is markedly impaired by disease,
as is almost universal in patients with severe "HPS". The intensive care
unit physicians hoped that the adoption of the nomenclature "hantavirus
cardiopulmonary syndrome" would improve the understanding among referring
physicians of the importance of providing cardiac support for patients with
HCPS. This hope may be justified, as referring physicians appear to be more
aware of the cardiac manifestations of HCPS in the wake of the use of the
term by referral center providers.
Although it causes me some inconvenience to use "HCPS" rather than "HPS", I
believe that it is helpful to support the efforts of the intensive care
unit and infectious diseases clinicians to improve understanding of the
pathogenesis of hantavirus disease, especially because they have noted that
the use of "HCPS" may have led to improved patient care and improved outcomes.
