Officials in Florida have reported the 20th case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse in 2016. The 11-year-old Quarter Horse mare from Sumter County was last vaccinated for EEE in late summer 2015 per the owner and had no recent travel history.

Clinical signs began on [13 Aug 2016] and the horse was euthanized for humane reasons later the same day.

EEE causes inflammation of the brain tissue and has a significantly higher risk of death in horses than West Nile virus infection. West Nile virus [WNV] disease affects horses' neurological system. The disease is transmitted by mosquito bite. The virus cycles between birds and mosquitoes, with horses and humans being incidental hosts. EEE infections in horses are not a significant risk factor for human infection because horses (like humans) are considered to be "dead-end" hosts for the virus. Effective equine vaccines for EEE and WNV are available commercially. Horse owners should contact their veterinarians if their horses are not already up-to-date on their vaccinations against both EEE and WNV.

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported that animal health officials in Florida and Wisconsin have confirmed new cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and officials in Washington have confirmed new West Nile virus (WNV) cases in horses in those states.

In Wisconsin, an unvaccinated 12-year-old Quarter Horse mare from Vilas County is the state's 4th equine EEE case for 2016.

"The mare was febrile (had a fever), unable to rise, and unresponsive with various neurologic signs including extensor rigidity, struggling, nystagmus (involuntary eye movement), intermittent tonic/clonic activity (rapid succession of muscle contraction and relaxation; often associated with seizures), and frequent tooth grinding," the EDCC said. "The attending veterinarian humanely euthanized the mare."

In Florida, the EDCC reported that a new EEE case was confirmed on 19 Sep 2016. "The 11-year-old Quarter Horse mare was last vaccinated for EEE in late summer 2015, per the owner, and had no recent travel history," the EDCC said. "Clinical signs began on [13 Aug 2016] and the horse was euthanized for humane reasons later the same day."

This is the 1st confirmed EEE case in Sumter County and Florida's 20th case for 2016.

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care; fatality rates reach 75-80 percent among horses. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

The single most important preventive measure is vaccination. Vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate. Responsible animal ownership means making sure the animal has received the necessary and appropriate immunization against disease.
