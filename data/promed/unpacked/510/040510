Thirty died from Guaron [moonshine, hooch]
More than 350 affected of whom 30 have died due to guaron adulterated
by methanol.
Police searching for the distributor who apparently has fled to
Honduras Inspection of pulperias [grocery stores/ convenience stores
that sell liquor]
------------------------------
The seizure of guaron from pulperias [grocery/convenience stores that
sell liquor] and bars in Leon increased yesterday. More than 600
pulperias were inspected by the police and the Ministry of Health
which seized 26 liters [of guaron] in a house located in the
Guadalupe neighborhood and found guaron being distributed in the
pulperia known as El Arbolito in the San Felipe neighborhood.
The number of persons affected by the consumption of methanol
increased to 358 this weekend, with 30 deaths so far, all in the Leon
Department [state, province].
Authorities are investigating 2 additional cases in persons affected
in the Chinandega Department, and they still do not know the origin
of the product that the victims consumed like guaron, an aguardiente
[brandy-like liquor] sold in bulk.
Of the total affected individuals, 5 were admitted to the intensive
care unit overnight and 30 were taken yesterday to hospitals in the
capital city [Managua]. Others who were affected with less risk [of
serious outcome] were admitted to health centers and clinics, in
coordination with the Ministry of Health (MINSA). Approximately 79
individual have been discharged [from the hospitals, health centers,
clinics] although they are being followed under supervision of the
health centers.
The police have issued 2 capture orders against proprietors of liquor
distribution centers which have supposedly commercialized the toxic
product, but so far only one has been detained. One went to
Honduras. At noon yesterday, the Leon office of the Public
Prosecutor, helped by the police, went to the house of the Oconors
family, with an order of capture for Martin Pereira Oconors, but they
were not able to find him.
"They did not encounter this person and the Police are continuing in
the search because this is an effective order", Freddy Arana, the
Departmental Public Prosecutor commented minutes after leaving the house.
An particular individual was identified as the distributor of the
guaron adulterated with methanol in the beach resort known as
Poneloya, where the 1st cases of methanol poisoning
presented. Relatives of the suspect commented that he had left for
Honduras 15 days earlier, for health reasons [had he ingested some of
this product himself???? - Mod. MPP]
The 2nd head of the Leon Police, commissioner Cesar Diaz, showed that
they are working with the intelligence forces and have not discarded
the possibility of requesting extradition of Pereira [from
Honduras]. "If he is outside of the country we are going to request
extradition" confirmed the commissioner.
The police have seized 58 000 liters of guaron in different retail
stores in Leon and have detained the proprietor of the La Cuarta
agency, Alfonso Martinez Quedo, who continued selling the liquor in
bulk, including to minors [below the legal age limit for liquor
sales], in spite of the illegality of the action.
Students poisoned
"There are 4 students from an institute that have been hospitalized.
From interviews with the students and their relatives we have begun
to form a pattern. At this time, the results tell us the quantity of
methanol that was sufficiently strong, which killed a person",
explained the 2nd chief of the Leon police department.
For today one hopes that the Public Prosecutor will present the
denunciations in court. Meanwhile, the Police are hoping that the
store proprietor will say where he obtained the product or admit if
he made the combination of the liquids [adulterating the hooch with methanol]
The commissioner of Police Diaz stated they are also interviewing
several patients to increase their information.
They put it in bottles.
The task of seizing the guaron is difficult because, according to the
Local System of Integrated Health Care (SILAIS) of Leon, the liquor
retail stores were packaging the guaron in bottles from different
national liquors in order to "camouflage" the sale [of
hooch/moonshine], but the supervisors had detected this strategy of
the retailers.
Yesterday, several packages of the prohibited liquor were seized, a
result of the authorities having requested the population to tell
where guaron could be bought, in order to prevent further deaths.
This tragedy in Leon, by poisoned guaron, has lead to fear on the
part of the population who usually consume traditional products,
since these products lack the official sanitary registration that
guarantees it's quality and safety.
The Minister of Health, Margarita Gurdian, said that "technical norms
have been written, which we hope that the Supreme Court (CSJ) will
resolve the issue of protection of civil rights (introduced by the
retailers) and that only officially registered liquor can be sold in
retail stores."
Sara Henriquez, a sociologist, showed that the sanitary emergency
Leon is living under is a demonstration of the high indices of
alcoholism that exist in the city, a subject that should be addressed
on the government's agenda.
Henriquez commented that this incident must generate a future study
on the quantity of alcoholics which exist [in Leon] and the reasons
for the level of alcoholism, pointing out that this problem mainly
affects men in the area.
The possibility of enacting a "dry law", as a means of putting an end
to the sale of guaron, was discarded late yesterday by the Minister
Gurdian, who showed that it would lead to the clandestine sale of
liquor in the area. [A "dry law" is a law which prohibits the sale of
alcohol for consumption in the geographic area covered by the law - Mod.MPP]
Gurdian also referred to the seizures which are taking place in other
zones of the country as a means of preventing cases [of methanol
poisoning - Mod.MPP]. All liquor confiscated will be tested for methanol.

Nicaragua seizes bad moonshine after 30 people die
-----------------------
Nicaraguan police stepped up moonshine raids on Saturday, bursting
into seedy bars and liquor stores selling an adulterated cane liquor
that the government says has killed at least 30 people.
Overnight, about a hundred new patients were admitted to the already
overflowing and rundown public hospital in Leon, about 55 miles (90
km) northwest of the capital, Managua, and the center of the
epidemic, raising fears of more deaths.
Following tips from the public, police burst into bars and shops in
the colonial city and seized grubby plastic barrels filled with
suspected bad hooch.
Many of the bars are bare concrete rooms where the raw liquor is sold
to customers who bring their own jugs or even plastic bags to hold the drink.
"Together with the police, we have confiscated 47,893 litres (12,650
US gallons) of hooch from 312 establishments. We're doing tests to
see what is contaminated with methanol and what is not," said Health
Minister Margarita Gurdian.
The sale of home-distilled alcohol is legal in Nicaragua and popular
in rural areas and among low-paid workers. Most of those killed were
poor, although one doctor from Leon hospital died.
Miurel Gamez, regional Health Ministry director, said 3 additional
deaths were attributed to the moonshine on Saturday, raising the
official death toll to 30.
A liter (quart) of hooch, called aguardiente in Spanish, sells for
about a dollar in Leon, making it much cheaper than beer or rum.
The bad batch was mixed with methanol, a poisonous type of alcohol
which when ingested can cause blindness, organ damage and death from
respiratory failure.
At the hospital, men and women attached to intravenous drips spilled
into peeling, roach-ridden corridors from the packed wards. Others on
ventilators looked close to death.
Short of medicine, nurses gave out shots of Nicaragua's high-quality
Flor de Cana rum. Ethanol contained in alcoholic drinks can be used
as an antidote to methanol poisoning.
A similar methanol poisoning outbreak killed at least 120 people in
neighboring El Salvador in 2000, forcing a 10-day nationwide drinking ban.

[Borrowing from the moderator comments [Mod.TG] in the ProMED-mail
posting: Methanol poisoning, humans - Kenya 20001117.2011"Methanol
(wood alcohol) is produced from the destructive distillation of wood.
Epidemics of methanol toxicity have resulted from the consumption of
methanol-contaminated whiskey. The formation of 2 toxic metabolites,
formaldehyde and formic acid, causes methanol poisoning. The
elimination rate depends upon the folate pool. In primates it is
generally small and consequently primates (including humans) are more
sensitive to methanol toxicity than other animals.
"Methanol is widely available in formulations including antifreeze,
windshield washer fluid, Sterno canned heat, shellacs, various
paints, paint removers, varnishes, duplicating fluids, and gasoline additives.
"Fatalities have been reported after ingestion of 15 ml (or 3
teaspoons) of a 40 per cent solution, although 30 ml is generally
considered a minimal lethal dose. With aggressive medical care it is
possible to survive the ingestion of 500-600 ml. However, consumption
of as little as 10 ml may cause blindness, with the amount varying
with the individual. Methanol is well absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract and peak levels occur generally within 30-90
minutes. It is distributed into tissues, so concentrations in the
vitreous humor and optic nerve are high. The highest concentrations
are found in the kidney, liver and gastrointestinal tract, with
smaller concentrations in the brain, muscle and adipose tissues.
"Methanol is oxidized 10 times more slowly than ethanol. Consequently
there is a longer elimination half-life. Onset of symptoms varies
between 40 minutes and 72 hours post-ingestion. Co-ingestion with
alcohol will delay the appearance of symptoms, but the absence of
symptoms does not exclude serious toxicity. The usual latent period
is 12-24 hours.
"Clinical signs may include headache, vertigo, lethargy and
confusion, which are common in mild to moderate ethanol
intoxications. Coma and convulsions appear in severe cases, probably
as a result of cerebral edema. Methanol produces little to no
euphoria, unlike ethanol.
"Blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, and photophobia
(sensitivity to light) are common complaints. Constricted visual
fields, fixed and dilated pupils, retinal edema and hyperemia of the
optic disk are common clinical findings. Prompt initial therapy is
necessary to reverse symptoms, though visual defects have persisted
in up to 25 per cent of severe cases.
"Methanol is a mucosal irritant and may produce nausea, vomiting and
abdominal pain, not unlike large doses of ethanol. Early in the
clinical course, gut decontamination with ipecac or lavage may be indicated.
However, if the methanol is mixed with ethanol, these patients may
not realize something is out of the ordinary until it is too late for
this type of treatment to be helpful.
"Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10 per cent dextrose
solution may be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination
half-life of methanol, the treatment may take several days and the
patient should be hospitalized. Dialysis may be necessary to prevent
kidney failure as well."
Another treatment is Fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole, Antizol) which
inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase and does not trigger delirium, fetal
risks, liver injury, gastropathy, or frequent vomiting. Also, Folinic
acid (leucovorin) is recommended for restoration of 1-carbon
metabolism, especially for methanol exposure."- Mod.TG]
