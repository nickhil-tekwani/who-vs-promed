Florida: 85 More Sickened on Disney Cruise Ship
-----------------------------------------------
At least 85 people on the Disney cruise ship Magic have contracted a
flu-like illness this week, even after the vessel was scrubbed because of an
earlier outbreak, officials said on Tue 26 Nov 2002.
The ship was disinfected on Sat 23 Nov 2002 after 275 people became sick on
the Magic's last 7-day trip. The illnesses are believed to be caused by a
"Norwalk-like virus", one of the most common gastrointestinal viruses. (The
virus is named for a outbreak in Norwalk, Ohio, 30 years ago). The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta was conducting tests to
identify the virus, spokeswoman Bernadette Burden said. Results were
expected later this week.
Disney Cruise Line spokesman Mark Jaronski said about 2400 passengers and
950 crew members were aboard the current Magic cruise, which left Saturday
night from Port Canaveral, about 50 miles east of Orlando, on a Caribbean
tour. The 964-foot ship spent Tuesday at Grand Cayman.
A cruise, where hundreds of passengers and crew mingle in close quarters for
days or weeks, can provide ideal conditions for a virus to spread.
Norwalk-like viruses are spread through food and water or contact with
infected people and can cause diarrhea, stomach pain, and vomiting for up to
2 days. Despite Saturday's disinfection, the infections are not expected to
vanish. "It's more of a situation where it slowly abates," Jaronski said
Tuesday.
A Norwalk-like virus also is suspected of sickening more than 500 passengers
and crew aboard the Holland America cruise ship Amsterdam during the past
few weeks. A 10-day cruise was canceled last week to allow time for a
thorough decontamination of the Amsterdam.

Florida: 60 More Sickened on Disney Cruise Ship
-----------------------------------------------
[The first part of this second report, apparently from the same news agency
source, is identical to that above except that the number of infected
persons is stated to be 60, not 85. This second report is supplemented by
the following additional information. - Mod.CP]
A Norwalk-like virus also is suspected of sickening more than 500 passengers
and crew aboard the Holland America Line cruise ship Amsterdam the past few
weeks. Last week, Holland America canceled 10-day cruise out of Port
Everglades to allow time for a thorough decontamination of the Amsterdam.
The CDC said on Sat 23 Nov 2002 that it did not suspect that the outbreaks
on the Magic and Amsterdam were intentional or related in any way. "These
are 2 separate incidents," spokeswoman Bernadette Burden said. "There are no
direct links."
Meanwhile, nearly a dozen people fell ill aboard the Amsterdam's sister
vessel, which arrived in San Diego on Mon 25 Nov 2002. About 10 passengers
on the Statendam complained of fever, nausea, and other flu-like symptoms.
Earlier this month, 42 passengers on a cruise to Hawaii also became sick
aboard the 720-foot Statendam. And in July 2002, 176 people aboard the
Holland America ship Ryndam became ill during a voyage in the Gulf of
Alaska.

[It is clear from these reports of recurrent outbreaks on the same ships
that effective decontamination procedures have yet to be developed. -
