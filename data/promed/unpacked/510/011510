Regarding WHO Fact sheet 139 entitled "MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT SALMONELLA
TYPHIMURIUM" disseminated in Promed Digest 98:55.
In the attempt to trace the origins of a newly emerged agent and the reasons
for its emergence, one must be careful not to confuse limited observational
data with what actually transpired in nature. WHO fact sheet 139 raises the
possibility that this confusion has occurred.
The authors' conclusions that "multi-drug resistant _Salmonella typhimurium_
DT104 initially emerged in cattle in 1988 in England and Wales," is valid
only to the extent that there was worldwide surveillance and sub-typing of
_S. typhimurium_ isolates in the 1980s, so that when a new clone was found
in England and Wales, one could be reasonably sure that it originated there.
Yet, weren't England and Wales relatively unique in the surveillance system
that was in place during the 1980s and early 90s? If so, the identification
of increased numbers of cases of multi-drug resistant DT104 (mrDT104) in
cattle and humans in that time period in England and Wales is equally
compatible with either of 2 hypotheses:
1. It first emerged there (as the WHO fact sheet unequivocally states).
2. It emerged somewhere else at some time prior to its observed "emergence"
but remained unnoticed until it reached a region (read England and Wales)
and a species (read cattle, humans, and a short list of others) from which
isolates of Salmonella were routinely collected and sub-typed and on which
timely analyses were regularly compiled and issued. If organized
surveillance is rare, this post-emergence dispersal could be regional or
even global.
>From the English/Welsh data alone one cannot say whether the emergent clone
originated in cows in England or mice in Mexico (for example) since the
observed data are potentially compatible with either. However, the emergence
of mrDT104 in the northwestern US roughly simultaneously to its emergence in
England and Wales (1), is not compatible with the first hypothesis.
The near-simultaneous emergence of mrDT104 in two widely geographically
separated areas also calls into question the assertion in fact sheet 139
that practices "in intense animal husbandry" are the driving force behind
the clone's emergence and dissemination. Given that cattle movement between
Great Britain and the USA does not occur and that transport of uncooked
bovine products is rare between these regions, it seems reasonable to
hypothesize that other species might be involved in such a rapid
intercontinental emergence. Indeed, mrDT104 has already been found in non -
bovine species more prone to intercontinental travel than cattle: humans (as
of 1984, ref 2), and several species of birds (1,6,7). And if one has
grounds to question cattle as the means of rapid intercontinental
dissemination of the clone, then one might also question the implication
that cattle are somehow the ultimate source of transmission into other
domestic and wild species. This is the case even if one accepts (as we do)
that cattle play an important role in local amplification of the mrDT104
clone and direct and indirect (food-borne) transmission to humans.
Lastly, the authors of Fact sheet 139 overstate the case in suggesting that
infection in other species is merely incidental: "Pets probably acquire the
infection like humans, in other words through consumption of contaminated
raw meat, poultry or poultry-derived products". Contrary to this assertion,
there is a body of evidence consistent with a role of the domestic cat in
the epidemiology of mrDT104: cat populations are uncontrolled in many areas,
with millions of 'outdoor' cats in the USA alone (3), for which wild birds
are a significant prey (4,5); limited sampling efforts have resulted in
mrDT104 being isolated from both wild birds (6,7) and cats (8,9); and, an
association has been observed between "density" of cats and mrDT104 presence
in cattle herds in Britain (10).
We understand that fact sheets are intended for broad dissemination and that
they cannot present all the complexities of an issue. However, we regard the
statement that "Multi-drug resistant _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104
initially emerged in cattle in 1988 in England and Wales," and the
implication that practices of "intensive animal husbandry" are now known to
have caused its emergence, as scientifically indefensible and even somewhat
reckless on the basis of the limited amount of existing data.

[The CVL/MAFF Salmonella Surveillance system was set up in 1973 by Peter
Dawson, the newly appointed head of the Epidemiology Section, partly in
order to demonstrate that he had initiated something. It also drew on the
proven value of many decades of successful and fruitful salmonella
surveillance by the PHLS/Colindale. Unfortunately, they seem to have had few
imitators in Europe whether in the public health or veterinary spheres. A
putative UK origin would gain strength if it could be shown that it was
recorded there before it was "seen" by the other continental surveillance
systems, or vice-versa. The large international trade in poultry byproducts
could have this serotype originating in Asia and after some everyday
cross-contaminations end up simultaneously in cattle in NW USA (Washington
State) and in western Europe (UK); because of the commercial intensity of
the poultry industries their (private) laboratory findings are infrequently
accurately reflected in government diagnostic laboratory reports. - Mod.MHJ
