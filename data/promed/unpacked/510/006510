FROG MORTALITIES - AUSTRALIA (SOUTHEAST QUEENSLAND)
====================================================

Queensland's principal conservation officer Ian Gynther has publicly
confirmed that the cause of death in a massive mortality among frogs in the
state is still unknown. Since May 1996 there has been a "wave" of frog
deaths in at least 6 of the 200 species in southeast Queensland. While a
fungal infection and a protozoan infestation in two specimens have been
determined, Gynther said that these causes seemed unlikely to be responsible
for all the deaths. Further tests are investigating the possibility of
viral infection and toxin exposure.
Australia has experienced similar high mortalities in frogs in the past.
But generally these have occurred at high elevations, not in coastal plains.
University researchers and conservation officials are calling for increased
funding of research on the frog losses.
Queensland Wildlife Preservation Society Director Pat Comben said "We've had
a history of half a dozen species becoming extinct ... now we've got a number
of other species obviously in decline because of whatever this cause is, and
still very little research is going on."

[In that this situation has been noted globally, it is of interest that "at
least" 6/200 species in Queensland are dying in excess numbers. If other
Queensland species are thriving or not dying, it might indicate a local
"cause". MHJ]
