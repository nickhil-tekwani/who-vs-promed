The mosquito that carries yellow fever has been detected in Gridley near Highway 99 and East Gridley Rd, according to the Butte County Mosquito and Vector Control District. The _Aedes aegypti_ was found Monday [2 Aug 2021] in Gridley as it has also been found in Chico, Thermalito, and Oroville. Just like Thermalito, this is the first time the invasive species was detected in Gridley. It was found in Chico and Oroville for 2 years in a row.

"The District is working to evaluate the extent of the infestation, and we plan to do everything we can to eradicate this mosquito and to protect our residents from the potential disease risk of these invasive mosquitoes," said Matt Ball, district manager. "Our goal is to control and eliminate this species of mosquito so that it does not become established in our community."

This species can transmit viruses like yellow fever and Zika.

[_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes continue to increase their geographic range in California this year (2021). This is the 2nd ProMED post of _A. aegypti_ being found in Butte County (the 1st was reported in ProMED archive 20200924.7810732). Now Butte County is included again with 4 other recent new locations: Sacramento, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Yolo counties. Shasta and San Joaquin counties were added earlier in 2020. The open question is if this mosquito has been established in these localities or if they have been eradicated there. Breeding sites can be difficult to find. There is no indication in the above report of how these mosquitoes arrived in Gridley.

Although the report above points out that _A. aegypti_ is capable of transmitting any of these mentioned viruses, ongoing transmission is unlikely; however, it is not zero, so elimination of this mosquito as quickly as possible in the localities where they have recently been found is prudent. Once well established, this mosquito is difficult to eradicate. Control requires considerable continuous effort. - Mod.TY
