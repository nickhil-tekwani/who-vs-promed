As many as 2 more horses at Fair Grounds tested positive for equine herpesvirus [Sat 7 Jan 2017]. The horses are housed in barn 36 and are trained by Mike Stidham. Both, according to a Fair Grounds release, returned a positive test from a nasal swab for the wild sub-type of the EHV-1 virus.

These were the 2nd and 3rd horses in barn 36 to test positive for the EHV-1 wild-type. A Stidham horse got sick on [1 Jan 2017] and was placed in isolation on the Fair Grounds backstretch, and barn 36 was put under a 14-day quarantine. That quarantine had been set to expire on [14 Jan 2017], and Stidham actually was allowed to enter horses for that card when entries were taken late last week. But those entered horses now must be scratched, since the barn 36 quarantine has been reset to [7 Jan 2017] and won't expire until [ Jan 2017] at the earliest.

Saturday's were the 6th and 7th EHV-1 positives during a Fair Grounds outbreak that began in late December [2016], when a horse got sick in barn 14 and eventually had to be euthanized after becoming neurologic. That horse, trained by Alice Cohn, returned a positive test on [26 Dec 2016] for the more-serious neuropathic sub-type of the EHV-1 virus.

A 2nd horse in barn 14, trained by Jeff Thornbury, tested positive for the same strain of the virus on [31 Dec 2016], but that was the most recent EHV-1 case from barn 14 and the most recent positive test for the neuropathic strain of the virus. Barn 14's quarantine, barring further positives, ends [13 Jan 2017].

The 5 subsequent EHV-1 cases, which in addition to the 3 Stidham horses occurred in the receiving barn [2 Jan 2017] and barn 47 [3 Jan 2017], all have been of the wild-type EHV-1. Neurlogic symptons are far less common from this sub-type, and only the 1st Stidham horse showed them. The other horses were tested after running a fever, and none became gravely ill.

Stidham said his 2 recent positive horses had fevers earlier last week and initially returned a negative result for EHV-1 through blood-testing before positive results were obtained [Sat 7 Jan 2017] through nasal swab tests. Stidham said both horses appeared healthy as of [Sun 8 Jan 2017]. They also were placed in the isolation area dedicated to horses that have tested positive for wild-type EHV-1.

Fair Grounds quarantined its entire backstretch on [2 Jan 2017] after the positive test from the receiving barn. State, federal, and Fair Grounds officials are scheduled to meet in coming days to discuss how the whole-backstretch quarantine will end. Regardless, the [Sat 7 Jan 2017] positives are a setback after 3 days with no new reported EHV-1 cases.

Fair Grounds will host a multi-stakes card 21 Jan 2017 that includes the Grade 3 Lecomte Stakes for 3-year-olds, a race that offers Kentucky Derby qualifiying points, and it now seems extremely unlikely any horses will be shipping from out of state for those races.

Fair Grounds-based horses whose connections had planned to ship for out-of-state stakes races in January may now be unable to do so. "I'm a Chatterbox", who has been aimed at the Jan. 28 Houston Ladies Classic, and "Gun Runner", whose connections have been considering the 12 million USD Pegasus World Cup the same day at Gulfstream, are the 2 most prominent such horses.
