So far 139 cases [of malaria] have been confirmed in the state of
Zulia from an outbreak of [malaria] which originated in the Colombian
Guajira region. Of these 139 cases only one occurred locally and the
remainder were infected while visiting Colombia.

This was reported by the Regional Health Secretary, Maria Moreno who
said in recent communications that the Ministry has taken measures to
control the outbreak. She assured that the patients were placed under
a strict epidemiological barrier, they are isolated to prevent the
disease from spreading to other municipalities; right now [the
patients] have been concentrated in Machiques and Sucre
municipalities.

Moreno also reported to have been in contact with health authorities
working in the border area where the outbreak originated, and are
working together, although the Colombian government has not as yet
declared an official alert. Another measure taken was to give a talk
for training medical personnel to be prepared in case of an epidemic.

Also, the head of the Regional Secretariat of Health, urged people to
be alert to the symptoms. She explained that the parasite identified,
_Plasmodium vivax_, is common and benign, but the patient must have
medical care and be evaluated by a doctor anyway. In that regard, she
recommended to look out for the symptoms: fever, chills, and headache
and, if present, the person must go to the nearest medical facility
for testing to determine if he/she is infected.

[The 138 patients presumably infected in the neighboring Colombian
department (state or province equivalent) of La Guajira indicate that
the outbreak reported by ProMED-mail on 7 Aug 2011 (Malaria -
Colombia: (LG) 20110807.2388) is more severe than previously known and
spreading. The measure taken by the Venezuelan authorities to
concentrate patients and isolate them is extraordinary, but preventing
patients and gametocyte carriers to infect local mosquitoes is
important. An alternative would be to administer primaquine, which
kills the gametocytes thereby reducing transmission.
