More than 90 kindergarten children were taken to hospital with suspected food poisoning in north China's Hebei province, the local government said [Mon 22 Jan 2018].

The kids fell ill after lunch at a private village kindergarten in Lingshou county in Shijiazhuang, the provincial capital. They were all taken to hospital for observation and treatment and are in stable condition.

Preliminary investigation showed that nitrite was mistaken for regular salt by kindergarten canteen staff and put into the food.

The local health, educational, public security, and market supervision departments are making further investigation.

[Sodium nitrate has on a number of occasions been mistaken for table salt. Clinical signs of ingestion may include gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, dizziness, bloody diarrhea, convulsions, and collapse. Purging and diuresis are expected. If the victim receives small, repeated doses there may be headache and mental impairment. Generally, in the case of mistaking sodium nitrate for sodium chloride, the dose may be larger for large meals typical of celebrations. Rare cases of nitrates being converted to the more toxic nitrites have been reported.

Sodium nitrate has been used in curing meat for centuries. Bacterial action converts the nitrate to nitrite, which kills the organism responsible for botulism poisoning. Generally sodium nitrite has replaced sodium nitrate, except in slow-cured hams.

Nitrite is added to certain foods to prevent the growth of the spore-forming bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, whose toxin causes botulism, leading to paralysis and, potentially, death. The word botulinum comes from the Latin word botulus, meaning sausage, which was responsible for many deaths centuries ago, before curing with nitrite was used. In addition to serving as an antimicrobial, nitrite is used to produce the characteristic flavor, texture, and pink color of cured meats.

At significant blood levels, the nitrite's oxidation of the iron in hemoglobin from the ferrous to the ferric state yields methemoglobin, which does not carry oxygen and imparts a brown hue to the blood. Symptoms of methemoglobinemia include headache, fatigue, tachycardia (fast heart rate), weakness, and dizziness. As oxygenation of tissues decreases to the point of becoming truly inadequate, dyspnea (shortness of breath), acidosis, arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms), coma, convulsions, and even death may occur.

The combination of nitrites or nitrates with meat can form nitrosamines, which has been shown to cause cancers, especially gastric cancers and esophageal cancers. Because of the nitrate concentration in processed meats, there has also been a link to colon cancer.

So while these nitrous compounds can be beneficial for preserving meat, it must be done correctly, using small amounts of the preservative. - Mod.TG
