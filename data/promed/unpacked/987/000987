2 new cases were confirmed yesterday (10 Apr 2003) in Essex. Both horses
were euthanized and 2 other horses that were in contact with the deceased
animals have been placed in strict isolation.
So far, the current outbreak of EHV paralytic disease is restricted to the
southeast of the country.
Although there are currently no official restrictions imposed by DEFRA and
no restrictions on the movement of horses, the BEF's veterinary director,
John McEwen, advises individuals, yards, and show organizers to continue
their normal activities, but to take "sensible precautions"
regarding infected yards or yards in close proximity to an outbreak.
There are 3 regions currently affected: Sussex, Kent and Kent/Surrey
borders Gloucestershire, Essex.
Anyone wishing to travel should first check with organizers that the event
is still running; secondly they should make sure that they will not be
traveling from an area in close proximity to one of the recent outbreaks.
While at an event, try to minimize contact between strange horses and where
possible tack up and un-tack in the lorry or trailer.
BHS head of welfare, Kerstin Alford, advises, "Our advice is to monitor
your horse's health closely and take sensible precautions when hacking out
or traveling, avoiding any areas where the virus has been confirmed. The
virus does not spread over long distances through the air, and infection is
usually passed from horse to horse by contact, but if you are concerned you
should contact your vet for further advice."
For information or advice on the EHV virus, contact the BHS Welfare
Dept (tel: 08701 299992) or visit the BHS website:

More information on EHV can also be found on the Animal Health Trust website:
