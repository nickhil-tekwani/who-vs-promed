Cassava viral disease ravages crops
-----------------------------------
Dozens of hectares of cassava plantations have been damaged by the cassava brown [streak] disease (CBSD) in districts of the Southern Province. The [affected] districts are major cassava producers in the country. The disease has also affected other parts of the country though at a relatively smaller scale.

CBSD is a devastating disease that renders the cassava tuber inedible. It is causing a huge loss. A farmer said it is the 1st time that the disease is affecting their crops. [Another farmer] said the disease has caused significant damages. He lost 11 ha [27 acres] of cassava to the virus.

Almost the entire cassava plantations in the area have been affected, with production expected to decrease significantly. The disease is also expected to affect the local cassava flour processing plant.

Authorities have blamed poor quality seeds as the main cause of the disease. The minister for agriculture, Dr Geraldine Mukeshimana, urged farmers to always use "quality varieties" to avoid risks of planting contaminated crops. She advised to uproot all the affected plants and destroy them to avoid the risks of future contamination. She also pledged to provide quality cassava [planting material] to farmers.

[Cassava brown streak (or root rot) disease can be caused by _Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV; genus _Ipomovirus_) and the more recently identified _Ugandan cassava brown streak virus_. It is considered a threat to the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, where the crop is a major factor in food security. Symptoms may include leaf chlorosis, stem necrosis and yellow/brown corky necrosis in the starch bearing tissue of roots. Leaves may appear healthy even when the roots have rotted away. Total crop losses of 20-80 per cent have been reported, and losses in individual root weight of up to 70 per cent have been observed in susceptible cultivars.

The virus is transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_ and is spread to new areas by infected cassava cuttings. Disease management includes pathogen exclusion, removal of infected plants, use of virus-free seed tubers for planting (as mentioned above) and vector control. However, these measures may be difficult to implement in developing countries. Resistant varieties are being developed for specific local requirements.

Recent outbreaks of CBSD appear to indicate a westward spread of the viruses (ProMED-mail post 20130508.1698543). CBSV is a particular threat to new varieties developed with resistance to Cassava mosaic disease (CMD; caused by a number of species and strains in the genus _Begomovirus_ and transmitted like CBSV). A new CBSV strain adapted to higher altitudes has emerged in eastern Africa and is affecting additional CMD resistant cultivars (ProMED-mail posts 20100525.1735 and 20120706.1191742).

Joint management of both diseases has become a major challenge in the region and globally (ProMED-mail post 20110829.2643) since development of crop varieties with stable resistance to multiple viruses is particularly difficult (ProMED-mail post 20090709.2463). The different viruses can be expected to mutate independently resulting in a range of changing combinations of strains, and different crop varieties are likely to be needed which are geared towards local viral populations.

Rwanda and other parts of the Great Lakes Region have previously been severely affected by CMD (see link below). Virus-free cassava seed tubers were widely distributed to smallholders, but it appears that this clean planting material may now have become infected with CBSD in the field.
