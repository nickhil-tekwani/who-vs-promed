Egypt (Aswan): avian influenza human H9N2, 1st human case
---------------------------------------------------------
On 10 Feb 2015, a human case of A (H9N2) influenza was detected by the routine national avian influenza surveillance system in Aswan Governorate. The case was a 3-year-old male. Avian influenza was suspected on 16 Jan 2015. Samples tested at Aswan subnational laboratory and subsequently the reference laboratory (NAMRU3) were positive for H9N2. Investigations revealed that the case had a history of contact with apparently healthy backyard poultry. H9N2 positive poultry have been detected in Egypt since 2011, yet this is the 1st confirmed human case.

Although ubiquitous in Asian poultry, and endemic in Egyptian poultry as well, H9N2 has only rarely been reported in humans. It has been reported a handful of times, including in Hong Kong in 1999 (2 cases), 2003 (1 case), and 2007 (1 case), and most recently in December of 2013 (see http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2013/12/hong-kong-isolation-treatment-of-h9n2.html).

Several additional human H9N2 virus infections were reported from China in 1998-99, and all known cases were mild [in children aged 9 months to 5 years]. More recently, in 2011 Bangladesh agreed to share the virus H9N2 with the US (CDC) for vaccine production, after detecting a case there.

Since the virus is most common in areas where testing and surveillance are less than optimal, we really don't know how many people end up infected by it. Most cases are mild, and would be indistinguishable from ordinary flu.

Although viewed as having at least some 'pandemic potential', perhaps more importantly H9N2 appears to play a central role in the evolution of other HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] viruses, including H5N1, H7N9, H5N6, and H10N8, all of which share several important features:
1. They all first appear to emanate from mainland China
2. They all appear to have come about through viral reassortment in poultry
3. While their HA and NA genes differ -- they all carry the internal genes from the avian H9N2 virus

The avian H9N2 virus -- unlike the H5 and H7 avian viruses -- is not considered a 'reportable' disease by the OIE since it is viewed as a relatively stable LPAI (low pathogenic avian influenza), not prone to evolving into a more dangerous HPAI form.

[This is thought to be the 1st human case of H9N2 in Egypt.

H9N2 influenza viruses of domestic ducks have become established in the domestic poultry of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses of the H9N2 viruses isolated from Hong Kong markets suggest 3 distinct sublineages. Among the chicken H9N2 viruses, 6 of the gene segments were apparently derived from an earlier chicken H9N2 virus isolated in China, whereas the PB1 and PB2 genes are closely related to those of the H5N1 viruses and a quail H9N2 virus A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (Qa/HK/G1/97) suggesting that many of the 1997 chicken H9 isolates in the markets were reassortants."

The majority of viruses that have been sequenced belong to the G1, chicken/Beijing (Y280/G9), or Eurasian clades. Since 1998, when the first human infection was detected, the isolation of A(H9N2) viruses from humans and swine has been reported infrequently. In all human cases the associated disease symptoms have been mild and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission.

"The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID/NIH), has issued a task order under an existing contract to Chiron Corporation of Emeryville, California, for the production of an investigational vaccine based on an H9N2 strain of avian influenza virus that has infected humans and has the potential to trigger a modern-day pandemic."
