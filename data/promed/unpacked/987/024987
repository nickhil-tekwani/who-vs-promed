North Dakota agriculture officials are warning producers to monitor their livestock after the first case of anthrax was confirmed earlier this week. The disease was reported in cattle in a Kidder County beef herd. Officials say producers in the county and surrounding areas should check with their veterinarians to see if they should start vaccinating their cattle for anthrax.

Anthrax vaccines are readily available, but it takes about a week to establish immunity, and the vaccine must be administered annually. Anthrax is caused by bacterial spores that can lie dormant in the ground until they are activated by heavy rains, flooding or drought. Two cases of anthrax were reported in North Dakota in 2020. In 2005, more than 500 confirmed animal deaths from anthrax were reported with total losses estimated at more than 1000 head.

[Kidder County is in central North Dakota, a part of the state that seldom sees anthrax cases, which historically are commoner in the eastern counties.

According to the agriculture commissioner, Doug Goehring, anthrax has been most frequently reported in north east, south east and south-central North Dakota, but it has been found in almost every part of the state (at one time or another). To see a map of North Dakota showing the location of Kidder County, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidder_County,_North_Dakota.

This outbreak was confirmed earlier this week by the North Dakota State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. But at this time, we lack any details of how many animals were affected -- one certainly provided the sample for laboratory confirmation -- as well as any contributory information about this ranch, possible previous cases, or a possible source infection or contaminated cattle grave.

While outbreaks have occurred throughout the state, they are, frankly, uncommon in the western half of the state. For years, there has been a thorough program to persuade the eastern ranchers to annually vaccinate there, and it has been successful in significantly reducing the number of outbreaks to near zero, the exceptions being ranchers who had not vaccinated their animals, their procrastination publicly noted. This means that the western ranchers have not been directly subject to the very successful vaccination campaign of the past decade, which has had a very significant impact on the incidence of this livestock disease.

Concurrent with this is the slow appreciation by the western ranchers that they need to get their cattle vaccinated PDQ if not yesterday. It is hoped they will follow their eastern colleagues' example. I hope that they do, as North Dakota is on its way, albeit slowly, as these things are, to be the first US state with a recognized significant livestock anthrax problem to be declared free of this disease. During these terminal stages of effective control, it is the procrastinating non-vaccinating ranches that tell us that the risk still exists and that routine regular anthrax vaccination should be the rule, not the exception. When the disease is truly sporadic, vaccination should targeted at those ranches with cases and their adjoining and neighboring herds. - Mod.MHJ
