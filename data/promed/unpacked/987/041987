The largest _E. coli_ outbreak in state history -- and possibly one of the
worst nationally -- has sickened nearly 300 people who believe they were
infected after attending a county fair. The outbreak at the Washington
County Fair about 35 miles north of Albany has led to one fatality.
By Wednesday, the number of patients seeking hospital treatment rose to
291, said Kristine Smith of the state Department of Health. Of those, 49
have been confirmed to have the potentially deadly O157:H7 strain of
bacteria, she said.
In the Albany area, eight children have developed hemolytic uremic
syndrome, or HUS, as a result of the contamination and were listed in
serious condition, Smith said. HUS attacks the blood cells and can result
in kidney failure. Five of the children were on kidney dialysis.
Health officials were still investigating the outbreak's cause, but
suspected the fair's water supply may have been contaminated when rainwater
runoff washed cow feces from a nearby farm into an underground aquifer.
If the number of people who have sought treatment turn out to have _E. coli_
poisoning, as is strongly suspected, it would make the outbreak one of the
largest in the country, health officials said.
In 1993, four children died and more that 500 others became ill from eating
undercooked hamburgers at a Jack in the Box fast-food restaurant in the
Pacific Northwest. In 1996, contaminated apple juice produced by Odwalla
Inc. caused 70 people in several western states and Canada to become sick,
and a 16-month-old child to die.
