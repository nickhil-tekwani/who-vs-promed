A Community Veterinary Emergency Team (CVET) composed of 2 experts arrives in Cyprus this afternoon [9 Dec 2014]. The team has been sent by EC's Directorate General Health and Consumers [DG SANCO] to address the outbreak of lumpy skin disease (LSD) in cattle in [Northern Cyprus].

The experts, coming from the UK, will have initial meetings with the competent departments of the State and will then move to the [Northern territory] to see the cases. After completing the inspections, they will return to [the Republic] and review the situation. Following the emergence of LSD in [Northern Cyprus], Agriculture Minister Nikos Kougialis [Republic of Cyprus] went exceptionally to Brussels, where he met with representatives of the DG SANCO urging action by the European Commission. Justifying the need for measures, the Minister said that this is LSD's 1st appearance on EU territory, requiring measures to be taken by the competent services of the Republic under European and international regulations in order to address and reduce its spread and to prevent a repetition of the bad experience in the past with Newcastle disease outbreaks in poultry.

According to Cyprus' veterinary services, so far, there has not been any case in the [Republic], but all possible measures should be applied to prevent the spread of the disease, which is transmitted through arthropods. The nodular dermatitis [LSD] can be fatal for animals.

[LSD was addressed in the editorial of a recent issue of the "Veterinary Record" [175: 300-301, dated 27 Sep 2014]. The article, titled "Lumpy skin disease: an African cattle disease getting closer to the EU," was authored by UK's LSD experts Eeva Tuppurainen and Chris Oura (see at http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/175/12/300.full.pdf).

The following excerpts may be of interest to subscribers:

1. The eradication of LSDV is notoriously difficult, if not impossible, without the use of vaccination. Early detection of the index cases is required in order to stand any chance of controlling the disease through the stamping out of infected and in-contact animals.

2. The field diagnosis of LSD, particularly in the early stages, is not easy. The disease can be confused with many other diseases and conditions, including pseudo-LSD and insect bites. In addition, beef cattle may not be monitored daily, and mild cases of LSD are easily missed. The situation is further complicated by the fact that only about half of infected viraemic animals show clinical signs of the disease, and these apparently normal animals are able to transmit the virus mechanically to blood-feeding vectors. The likely delay in diagnosing the disease in the field and in the lab may allow sufficient time to pass for the virus to contaminate vector populations, making the control of the disease through the culling of infected and in-contact animals futile.

3. According to the current OIE Terrestrial Code (OIE 2014), 3 disease-free years are required for a country to regain the official disease-free status following an LSD outbreak. If vaccination of cattle against LSD is implemented, international trade restrictions or a total ban of live cattle and their products will automatically follow.

4. Currently, only attenuated live vaccines are commercially available for use against LSD. Live vaccines are thought to provide good protection; however, the use of live vaccines in countries that are free of disease is considered risky because of potential safety issues, and also costly because of the associated trade restrictions that would ensue. Recently, novel inactivated LSDV and SPP virus vaccines have been developed. A safety and efficacy study in which sheep and goats were vaccinated with an inactivated SPP vaccine and then challenged with a virulent field strain has been conducted with promising results (unpublished data). Similar experiments are currently in progress in which cattle are being vaccinated with an inactivated LSDV vaccine and then challenged with virulent LSDV.

5. The spread of LSD is likely to have been a result of multiple factors; however, between 2012 and 2014, the lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) outbreaks are likely to have been associated with the severe political unrest and conflicts in Syria and Iraq, which have resulted in the collapse of veterinary services, an associated lack of effective vaccines in these countries, and the movement of hundreds of thousands of refugees and unvaccinated domestic ruminants from infected areas to those of a previous disease-free status.

6. Disease outbreaks have recently been reported in countries neighbouring Syria including Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq, and for the 1st time in Iran in July 2014. In addition, LSD is capable of spreading over very long distances, as demonstrated by the latest LSD outbreak in Azerbaijan in July 2014. The long-distance spread of the disease from Iraq, Iran and/or Turkey to Azerbaijan is more likely to have occurred via legal or illegal animal movements rather than through arthropod vectors.

7. As stamping out of infected and in-contact animals is not feasible in developing countries and the implementation of total restrictions of cattle movements is next to impossible because of transhumance and nomadic cattle farming practices, the control of the disease relies heavily on the immunisation of sufficient numbers of cattle. By using enforced compulsory vaccination campaigns, the spread of the disease has so far been curbed in Israel, Lebanon, and partially in Jordan.

8. LSD is a high impact but largely neglected cattle disease that is on the move and is posing a real and present threat to the cattle populations in European countries.

The report of the CVET's mission is anticipated with great interest. - Mod.AS
