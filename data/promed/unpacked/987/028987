Avian influenza: crisis over
----------------------------
Today all restrictions imposed after outbreaks of avian influenza in the
Netherlands will expire except in the surveillance zones around the
outbreaks. Starting from tomorrow, exports of live poultry, hatching eggs
and fresh, unprocessed poultry manure and litter can restart from the whole
country. Repopulation of the affected holdings is now taking place after
"sentinel birds" demonstrate that the virus is not longer present in the
holding. Restrictions in Belgium and the Land of North-Rhine Westphalia in
Germany were lifted in June. The avian influenza crisis, that started at
the end of February with outbreaks in the Netherlands, can now be
considered as over.

[This major outbreak, which reportedly began 28 Feb 2003, severely affected
the Netherlands with a limited spread to Belgium and Germany. About 30
million birds had to be killed. The causative agent was a highly pathogenic
avian influenza (HPAI) H7N7 influenza A virus. ProMED-mail dedicated more
than 60 postings to the issue.
The following issues which characterized this epizootic, might be
illustrative during future national and international deliberations
regarding the need for changes in the structure of the farming industry and
policies for the control animal disease. Others may be added.
- difficulties in containing the epizootic within a very densely
maintained, multi-species poultry population, where the free-roaming birds
in commercial farms may readily contact infected, wild water-birds;
- zoonotic aspects (almost 100 human infections, including one fatal case);
- the possible incidental spread of the virus by human contacts;
- a close field/laboratory collaboration with a continuous follow up in
animals (avian and mammal) and humans by the 2 reference laboratories;
- the role played by pet birds in the evolution of the epizootic;
- debates about the feasibility and need for emergency and preventive
vaccinations in view of ethical considerations, public opinion and their
implications upon international trade;
- debates about the killing of pet birds as a precautionary measure;
- the strong involvement of the political establishment, especially related
to the above two controversial issues and underlined by the zoonotic
aspects of the outbreak. - Mod.AS].
