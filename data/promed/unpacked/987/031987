[3] Singapore: childcare center, migrant worker dormitories
Date: Mon 25 May 2020 12:34 AM SGT

A childcare centre employee was among 3 Singaporeans confirmed to have COVID-19 on Sunday ([24 May 2020]). The 33-year-old woman worked at Iman Childcare (Tampines) and was one of 548 new coronavirus cases confirmed by the Health Ministry (MOH), bringing the total count to 31 616. She was confirmed to have the virus on Saturday [23 May 2020] after she began showing symptoms on the same day.

The other case is a 55-year-old man who went to work at the SSKBJV Dormitory after the onset of his symptoms on [17 May 2020]. He tested positive on Saturday [23 May 2020].The 3rd Singaporean is a 35-year-old woman who is a household contact of a 37-year-old man linked to the CDPL Tuas Dormitory, a cluster that now has 687 confirmed cases.

Of the 548 new cases, 544 were work permit holders in dormitories while 3 were Singaporeans and permanent residents. One of the new cases was a work permit holder outside the dormitories, and there were no imported cases. Of the new cases, 99 per cent are linked to known clusters.

No new cluster was confirmed on Sunday [24 May 2020], while a cluster at Strand Hotel in Bencoolen Street has been closed as there were no new cases linked to the hotel for 28 days, or 2 incubation periods.

The average number of new daily community cases has risen to 6 in the past week from 5 the week before. The daily averages for unlinked community cases have remained stable at an average of 2 per day for the last 2 weeks.

The number of COVID-19 patients discharged daily has exceeded new patients in the past fortnight, with 994 more discharged from hospitals and community facilities on Sunday [24 May 2020]. This means 14 867 have fully recovered from the disease. Of the 690 still in hospital, 8 are in critical condition in intensive care.

On Saturday [23 May 2020], the number of community cases -- which excludes those in dormitories -- edged up to 11. 2 of the cases work at pre-schools. Pre-school staff are being actively screened for COVID-19 ahead of the centres' reopening in phases starting from [2 Jun 2020], the authorities said, with 99 per cent of those tested -- about 15 300 -- found negative. MOH said this is partly due to active surveillance and screening of nursing home residents and pre-school staff.

To date, Singapore has seen 23 deaths from COVID-19 while 9 who tested positive died from other causes.

[The number of cases confirmed in Singapore has accelerated primarily due to the dormitory clusters. These dormitories are locations where migrant workers are housed and are crowded locations without the possibility of social distancing as recommended. It is impressive to see the degree of contact tracing and testing, especially the pre-screening of childcare workers prior to opening up the childcare centers next week. - Mod.MPP

Recently, an expert assisting Hubei Province, Tieying Sun, verified that there exists a certain ratio of novel coronavirus patients in critical condition in Wuhan complicated by infection with influenza. Many specialists are therefore cautioning that outbreaks of novel coronavirus in fall and winter of this year [2020] may be accompanied by the return of influenza, and are pointing out that influenza immunizations can lessen the impact of seasonal influenza.

[In the media report above, they mention 18 out of 50 severe cases (36%), had a co-infection with influenza virus and the SARS-CoV-2. There have been reports of co-infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and influenza virus. In a letter to the editor in the Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, Wu et al cautioned that with the challenges of testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a positive influenza test should not lead to not testing for the SARS-CoV2, assuming the respiratory infection was due to influenza alone. (see ref. 1 below). Most of the references on coinfection were clinical case reports (see refs 2-6 below)

The takeaway from the article above and the references is a caution for next year's peak influenza season if the SARS-CoV-2 is circulating at the same time.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 24 May 2020.

Highlights
----------
- At least 80 million children under one at risk of diseases such as diphtheria, measles, and polio as COVID-19 disrupts routine vaccination efforts, warn GAVI, WHO and UNICEF (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/22-05-2020-at-least-80-million-children-under-one-at-risk-of-diseases-such-as-diphtheria-measles-and-polio-as-covid-19-disrupts-routine-vaccination-efforts-warn-gavi-who-and-unicef). Agencies call for joint effort to safely deliver routine immunization and proceed with vaccination campaigns against deadly vaccine-preventable diseases.

- WHO Director-General Dr Tedros, in his regular media briefing (https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-executive-board) on [22 May 2020], thanked all those who contributed to the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. The Fund, launched with the United Nations Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation, has so far raised more than [USD 214] million from more than 375 000 individuals, corporations and foundations.

- The WHO Regional Office for the Americas organized media sensitization sessions on reporting on COVID-19 to increase journalists' understanding of the underlying issues relating to the pandemic and thus allow for more sensitive reporting (https://www.paho.org/en/news/22-5-2020-paho-held-media-sensitization-sessions-covid-19-reporting).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 49 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 55 646 new cases (54.8% of the global newly reported cases), and 2932 deaths (68.4%) for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 37.4% by Brazil, 36.8% were reported by the USA, Chile 6.4 %, Peru 5.3 %, and Mexico 5.3%. The Americas region is maintaining its status as having the highest cumulative case count of the 6 WHO regions, with the European region as the 2nd-highest region.

The European region reported 19 327 new cases (19.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 928 deaths (21.7%). Russia reported 44.3% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 15.3%, Turkey 6.1%, Belarus 4.9%, Italy 3.5%, Spain 4.4%, and Germany 2.2%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 12 887 new cases (12.7% of the global newly reported cases) and 182 deaths (4.2%). Saudi Arabia reported 18.9% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan 16.8%, Iran 14.5%, Qatar 13.4%, Kuwait 7.0%, the United Arab Emirates 6.3%, and Egypt and Afghanistan at 5.6% each.

The African region reported 3039 new cases (3.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 33 deaths (0.77%). South Africa reported 40.1% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria at 8.7%, Gabon 6.8%, Algeria and the DR Congo at 6.4% each, Ghana 4.3%, and South Sudan at 3.0%.

The Western Pacific region reported 925 new cases (0.91% of the global newly reported cases) and 19 deaths (0.44%). Singapore reported 69.4% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines 19.5%, Malaysia 5.2%, and South Korea 2.7%. Singapore, the Philippines, and Malaysia account for 94.1% of the total newly reported cases in the region.

The South East Asia region reported 9688 new cases (9.5% of the global newly reported cases) and 192 deaths (4.5%). India reported 69.8% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh 19.3%, and Indonesia 9.8%. These 3 countries make up 99.0% of all reported cases in the region.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 24 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas is increasing, as is South East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkins' CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Johns Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
