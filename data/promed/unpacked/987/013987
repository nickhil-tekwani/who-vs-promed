After contact with a dead rabbit in Baden-Wuerttemberg in southern
Germany, 3 members of a family were infected with tularemia in late
summer 2007. The patients were a forest worker (patient A) in his
20s, and his parents, both in their 50s. Tularemia is very rare in
Germany. From 2002 to 2006, between one and 5 cases were reported
annually, with the exception of 2005 with 15 reported cases (1). In
2007, 19 cases were reported, 11 of them in Baden-Wuerttemberg (2).
In the district in which the 3 cases occurred, no tularemia cases had
been reported in recent years.

Case description
----------------
In late August 2007, a hare was run over by a car driven by patient A
and the local forester. The animal was heavily injured and was put
down by the forester. Patient A took the dead hare home and skinned
it together with his father on the same day. His mother then stored
the hare in the freezer. Three days later, patient A's father
complained of influenza-like symptoms, fever of 39-40 deg C (102-104
deg F), headache, and joint pain. On the next day, patient A and his
mother developed the same symptoms, and also experienced dizziness. A
4th family member who had not been at home on the day the hare was
skinned did not show any symptoms.

Over the course of the following weeks, the 3 patients suffered
mainly from influenza-like symptoms, and felt increasingly weak.
Patient A's mother reported impaired wound healing with regard to a
blister on a finger of her right hand (a possible entry site for
pathogens) that was caused by a burn and healed only after weeks.
Laboratory investigations by the family doctor returned only
unspecific inflammatory serum parameters. X-ray and sonography
supplied no evidence pointing towards a diagnosis of tularemia.

In mid-October 2007, patient A's father developed swollen lymph nodes
in his left axilla and left elbow. The lymph node in his elbow
developed an abscess and was extirpated at the university clinic in
Ulm, Germany. Patient A and his mother also presented with swollen
lymph nodes, the mother in the right axilla and the left elbow, the
son in the left axilla. The resulting abscesses were removed at their
regional hospital.

The 4th family member works at a medical diagnostic center. As the
influenza-like symptoms in her family persisted for several weeks,
she took a serum sample from patient A's father in mid-October 2007,
about 2 months after he had skinned the hare, and had it analysed at
her work-place. Two weeks later, the center detected elevated
antibody titers against _Francisella tularensis_ in the serum: an IgG
titer of 1:2560 compared to normal values of under 1:40, and an IgM
titer of 1:160 compared to a normal of under 1:20, as measured by
immunofluorescence test (IFT).

A positive serology for tularemia is defined as a 4-fold or higher
increase in specific antibodies to _F. tularensis_. The patients, as
well as the hospital in which patient A and his mother had been
treated, were informed immediately of the diagnosis indicative of
acute or recent tularemia.

Laboratory investigation
------------------------
Three days later, the hospital informed the district public health
authorities about a positive diagnosis of tularemia in a relative of
2 patients that had been released after lymph node extirpation. At
the request of the district public health office, the diagnostic
center sent serum from patient A's father to the German consultant
laboratory for tularemia in Munich. Tularemia infection was confirmed
for all 3 family members.

The local veterinary authorities collected the frozen hare from the
family's freezer and took it to a veterinary laboratory for analysis.
That institute arranged for the transfer of the hare to the German
consultant laboratory for tularemia, where infection of the hare with
_F. tularensis_ was confirmed in culture and with molecular techniques.

Treatment
---------
Due to the suspicion of tularemia, the 3 patients were treated with
antimicrobials by their family doctor immediately after the diagnosis
by the diagnostic center. In addition, the family received advice
from the local veterinary office on the necessary measures, such as
disinfection of the freezer. The local foresters were informed about
the possible infection of the hares in the area.

In January 2008, the district public health office instigated a
follow-up laboratory examination of the family, which was performed
by the state public health office of Baden-Wuerttemberg with the
following result: IFT (immunofluorescence test) antibody titers (IgG
and IgM) in the serum of the 3 family members with clinical symptoms
had gone down compared to the previous examination (IgG greater than
400 U/mL; IgM greater than 500 U/mL in all 3 cases). As expected, the
daughter's IFT antibody count was normal.

the Robert-Koch Institute on 25 Jan 2008: Epidemiologisches Bulletin
no. 4/2008. Available from

[In 2 of the past 3 years, the number of reported cases of tularemia
in Germany has been higher. The 2005 'bump' was caused by a single
cluster noted below, but it is not clear that this was the case with
the 2007 'bump'.

Although classically transmitted to man via infected animals such as
rabbits or a tick vector, infection with _Francisella tularensis_ (a
Category A biowarfare disease) may be acquired from contact with soil
or water harboring the bacterium. Although tularemia pneumonia, which
did not occur in this outbreak, is the form of the disease associated
with biological terrorism, it may also occur naturally, as is
exemplified by the sporadic case described in New York City and the
outbreak among gardeners on Martha's Vineyard, both cited in past
ProMED-mail postings below.

Regarding water-related outbreaks of tularemia, outbreaks include 64
cases in Dagestan, Russia associated with a flood-plain swamp (1), 49
cases in Tuscany, Italy linked to an unchlorinated water system (2),
and an outbreak in the Smolensk province of Russia also attributed to
contamination of a water supply (3).

A previous cluster of tularemia with 10 cases including one death
occurred in Germany in 2005 in the Hesse state just north of
Baden-Wuerttemberg. Baden-Wuerttemberg is a Land (state) of the
Federal Republic of Germany in the southwestern part of the country
to the east of the Upper Rhine and can be seen on a map of the country at
