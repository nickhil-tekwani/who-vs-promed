There have been 35 cases of scarlet fever in Plymouth and Devon [England] in the 1st 6 weeks of the year [2014] -- a third of total seen in 2013 as a whole. Some parts of the country have seen a huge increase in cases of the relatively uncommon disease since the start of 2014.

Most of the cases in the South West so far this year [2014] are in Devon -- which includes [the city of] Plymouth; since 1 Jan 2014 there have been 8 cases in Somerset, 35 in Devon and Plymouth, and 4 in Cornwall. Last year [2013] there were 77 notifications of scarlet fever in Devon and 15 in Plymouth.

Incidents of scarlet fever peak in the winter and spring. Scarlet fever is an infectious disease caused by a type of bacteria called _Streptococcus [pyogenes_]. It is fairly uncommon in the UK and usually affects children, but people of any age can catch it.

Although scarlet fever used to be a very serious disease, most cases today are quite mild and respond quickly to antibiotic treatment. A spokesman for Public Health England [PHE] said: "We would advise that if you think you or your child has scarlet fever, to consult with your GP. Scarlet fever is spread through close physical contact or by contact with the mucous from an infected person. The disease often starts with a sore throat or a skin infection about 12 hours before the main symptoms appear."

General symptoms include: high temperature, headache, and a general feeling of being unwell. The characteristic symptom of scarlet fever is a fine rash on the body that feels like sandpaper to touch. It may start in one place, but soon spreads to many parts of the body, commonly the neck, chest, elbows, inner thighs, and groin. The rash does not normally spread to the face, but the cheeks become flushed and the area just around the mouth stays quite pale. The overall impression of someone with a flushed, red face is what gives the disease its name.

There is a white coating on the tongue, which peels a few days later leaving the tongue looking red and swollen (known as 'strawberry tongue'). More severe infections may cause high fever, feeling sick, and vomiting.

All tissues and handkerchiefs contaminated with mucus from someone with scarlet fever should be washed or disposed of immediately. You should wash your hands thoroughly if you have touched the tissues/handkerchief. Children with scarlet fever should be kept off school for 24 hours after the start of treatment and, during that time, be kept away from other children as much as possible.

For further information, visit the HPA [Health Protection Agency, which is now part of PHE] or NHS [National Health Service] dedicated pages.

[Scarlet fever is caused by erythrogenic (causing inflammation and reddening of the skin) toxin-producing group A streptococci (GAS) (_Streptococcus pyogenes_), and usually follows streptococcal pharyngitis, but may also follow streptococcal infection of the skin or soft tissue, such as wounds, burns, or the uterus (that is, puerperal scarlet fever). Scarlet fever usually occurs in children. By the age of 10 years, most people will have developed immunity.

ProMED-mail recently posted reports on scarlet fever in Lincolnshire (see ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - UK (02): England 20140302.2308816) and Cumbria (see ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - UK: England, alert 20140215.2279072.)

Cumbria is a sparsely populated county in the North West Region of England and Lincolnshire is a county in the eastern part of the England, on the North Sea coast; whereas the current report on the increased occurrence of scarlet fever concerns the adjacent counties of Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall in the South West Region of England.

Plymouth is a city on the south coast of Devon. For a map of England's counties, see http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/England_Admin_Counties_1965-1974.png.

We are not told if these regional outbreaks are part of a more widespread increase in the number of cases of scarlet fever or if there is any linkage of these 3 regional outbreaks. Genotypic characterization of outbreak isolates by molecular typing methods such as multilocus sequencing, ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), or random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis will be necessary to see if there is commonality among the outbreak strains. ProMED-mail would appreciate updated information on the epidemiology of the outbreaks in the affected regions, as well as information on the molecular characteristics of the strains of _Streptococcus pyogenes_ involved.
