Even vaccinated people with mild breakthrough COVID-19 infections can experience debilitating, lingering symptoms that affect the heart, brain, lungs and other parts of the body, according to new research from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System.

The study of more than 13 million veterans also found that vaccination against the virus that causes COVID-19 reduced the risk of death by 34% and the risk of getting long COVID by 15%, compared with unvaccinated patients infected with the virus. However, vaccines were shown to be most effective in preventing some of the most worrisome manifestations of long COVID -- lung and blood-clotting disorders -- which declined about 49% and 56%, respectively, among those who were vaccinated.

The research is published 25 May 2022 in Nature Medicine.

"Vaccinations remain critically important in the fight against COVID-19," said 1st author Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University. "Vaccinations reduce the risk of hospitalization and dying from COVID-19. But vaccines seem to only provide modest protection against long COVID. People recovering from breakthrough COVID-19 infection should continue to monitor their health and see a healthcare provider if lingering symptoms make it difficult to carry out daily activities."

The researchers classified patients as fully vaccinated if they had received 2 doses of the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine. At the time the research was conducted, the database used for this study did not include information about whether patients received boosters.

"Now that we understand that COVID-19 can have lingering health consequences even among the vaccinated, we need to move toward developing mitigation strategies that can be implemented for the longer term since it does not appear that COVID-19 is going away any time soon," said Al-Aly, who is also the chief of research and development at the VA St. Louis Health Care System. "We need to urgently develop and deploy additional layers of protection that could be sustainably implemented to reduce the risk of long COVID."

Such protective layers could include nasal vaccines that are more convenient or potent than the current shots, or other types of vaccines or drugs aimed at minimizing the risks of long COVID.

"Getting COVID-19, even among vaccinated people, seems almost unavoidable nowadays," said Al-Aly, noting that 8%-12% of vaccinated people with breakthrough infections may develop long COVID. "Our current approach will likely leave a large number of people with chronic and potentially disabling conditions that have no treatments. This will not only affect people's health, but their ability to work, life expectancy, economic productivity and societal well-being. We need to have a candid national conversation about the consequences of our current approach."

Since the pandemic started, more than 524 million people globally have been infected with the virus; of those, more than 6 million have died -- including more than one million in the United States alone.

"Let's say SARS-CoV-2 is here for 10 years," Al-Aly continued. "People are sick and tired of masking and social distancing, and it's simply not sustainable to ask that they continue to do so. We need to come up with additional layers of protection that allow us to resume normal life while co-existing with the virus. Current vaccines are only part of the solution."

For the study, researchers analyzed the de-identified medical records of more than 13 million veterans. The records are in a database maintained by the US Department of Veterans Affairs, the nation's largest integrated healthcare delivery system. The researchers examined data of 113 474 unvaccinated COVID-19 patients and 33 940 vaccinated patients who had experienced COVID-19 breakthrough infections, all from 1 Jan 2021 through 31 Oct 2021.

The patients with COVID-19 were mostly older, white men; however, the researchers also analyzed data that included more than 1.3 million women and adults of all ages and races.

The study does not include data involving the virus's omicron variants, which began spreading rapidly in late 2021. However, Al-Aly said prior studies have suggested the vaccine is effective against all current variants.

Among the study's other findings:
- In addition to complications involving the heart, brain and lungs, other symptoms associated with long COVID included disorders involving the kidneys, blood clotting, mental health, metabolism and the gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal systems.

- Long COVID risks were 17% higher among vaccinated immunocompromised people with breakthrough infections compared with previously healthy, vaccinated people who experienced breakthrough infections.

- An analysis of 3667 vaccinated patients who were hospitalized with breakthrough COVID-19 infections showed that they experienced 2.5 times the risk of death than people who were hospitalized with influenza. They also had a 27% higher risk of long COVID in the first 30 days after diagnosis compared with 14 337 people who were hospitalized with seasonal influenza.

- The datasets also compared long-term health outcomes with a prepandemic control group of more than 5.75 million people (meaning they had never had COVID-19 because it hadn't yet existed). Across the board, people who had breakthrough COVID-19 faced significantly higher risks of death and illnesses such as heart and lung diseases, neurological conditions and kidney failure.

"The constellation of findings shows that the burden of death and disease experienced by people with breakthrough COVID-19 infections is not trivial," Al-Aly said.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
"The post-acute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection -- also referred to as long COVID -- have been described, but whether breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection (BTI) in vaccinated people results in post-acute sequelae is not clear. In this study, we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs national healthcare databases to build a cohort of 33 940 individuals with BTI and several controls of people without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including contemporary (n = 4 983 491), historical (n = 5 785 273) and vaccinated (n = 2 566 369) controls. At 6 months after infection, we show that, beyond the first 30 days of illness, compared to contemporary controls, people with BTI exhibited a higher risk of death (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.59, 1.93) and incident post-acute sequelae (HR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.46, 1.54), including cardiovascular, coagulation and hematologic, gastrointestinal, kidney, mental health, metabolic, musculoskeletal and neurologic disorders. The results were consistent in comparisons versus the historical and vaccinated controls. Compared to people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not previously vaccinated (n = 113 474), people with BTI exhibited lower risks of death (HR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.74) and incident post-acute sequelae (HR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.89). Altogether, the findings suggest that vaccination before infection confers only partial protection in the post-acute phase of the disease; hence, reliance on it as a sole mitigation strategy may not optimally reduce long-term health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings emphasize the need for continued optimization of strategies for primary prevention of BTI and will guide development of post-acute care pathways for people with BTI."

Discussion
----------
"Our comparative analyses provide a framework to better evaluate and contextually understand risks of the post-viral condition in people with BTI versus non-infected controls, versus SARS-CoV-2 infection without prior vaccination and versus seasonal influenza. The findings show that vaccination only partially reduces the risk of death and post-acute sequelae, suggesting that reliance on it as a sole mitigation strategy may not most optimally reduce the risk of the long-term health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection."

These findings suggest that masks remain an important protective measure even following vaccination, as long COVID remains a health risk for the vaccinated as well as the unvaccinated. But with the current anti-mask sentiment, improved more efficient ventilation systems in buildings are going to be more important in protecting individuals. - Mod.LK]

[2] Omicron BA.4/5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
The omicron lineage of SARS-CoV-2, first described in November 2021, spread rapidly to become globally dominant and has split into a number of sub-lineages. BA.1 dominated the initial wave but has been replaced by BA.2 in many countries. Recent sequencing from South Africa's Gauteng region uncovered 2 new sub-lineages, BA.4 and BA.5, which are taking over locally, driving a new wave. BA.4 and BA.5 contain identical spike sequences and, although closely related to BA.2, contain further mutations in the receptor binding domain of spike.

Here, we study the neutralization of BA.4/5 using a range of vaccine and naturally immune serum and panels of monoclonal antibodies. BA.4/5 shows reduced neutralization by serum from triple AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccinated individuals compared to BA.1 and BA.2. Furthermore, using serum from BA.1 vaccine breakthrough infections there are likewise, significant reductions in the neutralization of BA.4/5, raising the possibility of repeat omicron infections.

Discussion
----------
Following its emergence in November 2019, a succession of SARS-CoV-2 viral variants have appeared with increased fitness, which have rapidly outcompeted the preceding strain and spread globally, the most recent, omicron appearing in late 2021.

Despite the availability of vaccines, the pandemic has not been brought under control and through omicron, infections are as high as ever. Although vaccines are effective at preventing severe disease, they are less effective at preventing transmission, particularly of the omicron sub-lineages. The very high level of viral replication globally drives the accrual of mutations in the viral genome and we are now seeing the assembly of dozens of individual changes in single viruses. Virus recombination, which was predicted, is now being detected, allowing shuffling of complex genomes, such as XD (delta/BA.1) and XE (BA.1/BA.2), which in the latter case may be more transmissible (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1063424/Tech-Briefing-39-25March2022_FINAL.pdf).

How such large sequence jumps, such as that to the omicron lineage, occur is not known. It has been suggested that these may be occurring in immunocompromised or HIV infected cases, where chronic infections have been documented to last for many months or in some cases over a year. Selection of antibody escape mutations has been documented in such individuals (Cele et al., 2021b; Karim et al., 2021; Kemp et al., 2021 [see source URL for complete references]), and successive rounds of replication, recombination and perhaps reinfection may be responsible for the selection of the constellation of S mutations found in the omicron lineage.

BA.4/5, the most recently reported omicron sub-lineages, seem to be taking hold in South Africa and may spread globally to replace BA.2. Although highly related to BA.2, BA.4/5 contain the 69-70 deletion in the NTD which was also found in alpha, BA.1 and BA.3, together with additional mutations in the RBD (L452R and F486K). Thus, BA.4/5 has assembled mutations at all of the previously described positions in the VoC alpha (N501Y), beta (K417N, E484K, N501Y), gamma (K417T, E484K, N501Y) and delta (L452, T478K), the only difference being E484A in BA.4/5 rather than E484K found in beta and gamma.

Here, we report greater escape from neutralization of BA.4/5 compared to BA.1 and BA.2. Serum from triple vaccinated donors has ∼2-3-fold reduction in neutralization titres compared to the neutralization of BA.1 and BA.2. Additionally, serum from breakthrough BA.1 infections in vaccinees shows ∼2-3-fold reduction in neutralization titres to BA.4/5 compared to BA.1 and BA.2. These data suggest that a further wave of omicron infection, driven by BA.4/5 is likely, partly due to breakthrough of vaccine and naturally acquired immunity, although there is no evidence yet of increased disease severity Using a panel of potent mAbs generated from vaccinated cases infected with BA.1 we show the importance of the 2 new RBD mutations in BA.4/5. The activity of many mAbs is either knocked out or severely impaired against BA.4/5 compared to BA.2. From the neutralization data on BA.4/5, compared to that on delta, we have been able to impute the contribution of L452R and F486V, and by combining with SPR data, as well as previous mapping by BLI competition matrices and detailed structural data (Nutalai et al., 2022) we are able to understand the basis of these effects on neutralisation and show that the L452R and F486V mutations both make major contributions to BA.4/5 escape.

It is clear that the omicron lineage, and particularly BA.4/5, has escaped or reduced the activity of mAbs developed for clinical use, although ADZ7442 and S309 still show activity against BA.4/5. New monoclonals and combinations may be needed to plug the gap in activity, to protect the extremely vulnerable and those unable to mount adequate vaccine responses. There is also a question about vaccines; all current vaccines use spike derived from the original virus isolated from Wuhan. Vaccines have been remarkably effective at reducing severe disease, and a triple dosing schedule has provided, at least in the short term, protection against omicron. However, prevention of transmission may become less effective as viruses evolve antigenically further from ancestral strains. Some argue for next-generation vaccines tailored to antigenically distant strains such as omicron to give better protection, probably used in combination with boosters containing ancestral strains. Whilst vaccination is unlikely to eliminate transmission, the combination of vaccines with boosting by natural infection will probably continue to protect the majority from severe disease.

Finally, it is impossible to say where SARS-CoV-2 evolution will go next, but it is certain the virus will continue to drift antigenically. This may be a continuation along the omicron lineage or we may see a large jump to a completely new lineage, like the one from delta to omicron. The observation that of the 30 aa substitutions in BA.1, all but one was achieved by a single base change in the codon, suggests there remains plenty of antigenic space for SARS-CoV-2 to explore and the capacity for recombination, which has so far not been observed to have breakpoints within the major antigenic sites, could generate more radical antigenic shift.
