Health bosses have warned that a measles outbreak in Teesside could spread to Tyne and Wear. Cases of measles have been on the rise since a report in the medical journal "The Lancet" linked cases of autism to the measles mumps and rubella (MMR) joint vaccine. The article was discredited, and The Lancet published a retraction, but some parents remain unconvinced and have refused to allow their children to receive the MMR vaccine. As a consequence, the herd immunity needed to protect the British people from measles has dropped, putting the very young, the elderly and infirm at risk of what is a serious and highly infectious virus. An outbreak in Swansea, Wales has seen more than 1000 people -- mainly children -- queue up for MMR vaccinations.

The latest Health Protection Agency figures show that of the 200 confirmed cases of measles in the North East, there was one in Gateshead, 2 in Sunderland, and one in Northumberland. All of the other confirmed cases were in County Durham and Teesside, where people aged between 10 and 19 years were worst affected, making up 39 percent of all cases.

There have been no confirmed cases in Newcastle, North Tyneside or South Tyneside, Julia Waller, immunisation lead for the North East PHE Centre, said. "There is no treatment for measles, but it can be prevented by the MMR vaccine, and 2 doses are required to ensure the best protection. "If anyone is unsure about their immunisation status, they should check with their GP."

During 2012, there were 2016 laboratory confirmed cases of measles, the highest annual total since 1994.

Health bosses are hoping they are on track to avoid a repeat of the measles outbreak that swept across Sussex last year [2012]. There have only been 2 confirmed cases of the disease so far this year [2013] compared to 54 for the same period in 2012. There were 330 confirmed cases of the disease in the county during 2012, although the actual number was believed to be higher because samples are not taken from every patient. Brighton and Hove was the worst affected with 195 people falling ill, while East Sussex had 90 and West Sussex 45.

This year [2013], there have been 2 confirmed cases in West Sussex, while Brighton and Hove and East Sussex are clear so far. The outbreak was blamed on poor take up rates for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Around 95 percent of a community needs to have both doses of the jab in order for it to have an impact, and people are being urged to make sure they and their children are completely up to date. The warning comes as health officials battle to contain an outbreak of measles in Swansea, where up to 600 people have been infected.

There has been a big jump in measles cases reported in the Swansea epidemic over the past 2 days, says Public Health Wales (PHW). Another 73 cases bring the total to 693, with health officials warning still not enough children aged 10 to 17 are coming forward for MMR jabs. "We remain extremely concerned this outbreak is showing no signs of going away," said Dr Marion Lyons, of PHW. More drop-in clinics are taking place this weekend.

Swansea is vulnerable. A large campaign may have vaccinated 1700 people, but a further 6000 are still unprotected. Measles is an incredibly infectious and sometimes fatal disease; the end of this outbreak is not yet in sight.

The surge in cases comes 15 years after confidence in the MMR jab was rocked by claims of a link with autism. That has now been completely discredited, and vaccination rates have since increased. But it has left a legacy of a generation of children across the UK who are now going through school with low levels of protection. Across the whole of Wales and England, there were 2030 cases last year [2012], the highest in nearly 2 decades.

It is Swansea in 2013. It was Merseyside in 2012. Measles outbreaks may be something we have to get used to. More than 1700 people received MMR jabs at special drop-in clinics in Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend last weekend. Another 900 were vaccinated in the Swansea area last week. However, Public Health Wales (PHW) has warned that despite those immunisations, the outbreak has not been brought under control. At least 6000 children have still not had the MMR vaccine. The Swansea outbreak began last November [2012], and health officials say it shows no sign of abating.

More hospital drop-in clinics will be held in Morriston and Singleton hospitals in Swansea, Neath Port Talbot hospital and the Princess of Wales [hospital] in Bridgend. They will target children and adolescents who did not have their scheduled MMR jabs as babies and toddlers. PHW has said not enough children aged 10 to 17 are coming forward for the jabs and have urged parents to get their children vaccinated through GPs.

Dr Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, said: "With measles cases at almost 700, with 73 of those reported in the last 2 days alone, we remain extremely concerned that this outbreak is showing no signs of going away. She said they have particular concerns about unvaccinated children aged 10 to 14.

Public Health Wales says it is inevitable that some of those vaccinated in the past week will already be incubating measles, and vaccination will not prevent them from becoming unwell. But their illness is likely to be milder than if they had not received the vaccine. Dr Lyons added: "Measles cannot be taken lightly because you can never tell who will go on to develop the more serious complications of pneumonia or encephalitis.

Meanwhile, health officials in Cardiff and Vale of Glamorgan are planning to hold drop-in vaccination clinics at Cardiff Royal Infirmary and Llandough Hospital on Saturday [13 Apr 2013] as a "sensible precaution" in light of the epidemic in Swansea. Dr Tom Porter, consultant in public health medicine, said: "We have not seen a local outbreak in the Cardiff and Vale area yet, but it is important that children and teenagers have both [MMR] jabs given how serious the risks are from measles." He estimated that around 13 000 children under 19 had not had 2 MMR jabs and were not adequately protected.

Confirmed cases of measles reached an 18-year high in 2012 following sustained outbreaks in Wales and England. Last year [2012], there were more than 2016 cases of measles in England and Wales, although current uptake of the MMR vaccine is the highest it has ever been. Figures reported by primary care trusts (PCTs) show coverage of 91 percent in 2011-2012, compared to 89 percent in 2010-2011. This is the 1st time coverage has exceeded 90 percent since 1997-1998; however, MMR coverage is still below the World Health Organisation (WHO) target of 95 percent.

The current Welsh measles outbreak, based in Swansea, is unlikely to see the number of confirmed cases drop. Cases of measles reported to Public Health Wales have now reached 620. Despite more than 1700 MMR jabs being given over the weekend, the public health body is warning there is "no sign of the outbreak coming to an end." Dr Marion Lyons, Director of Health Protection for Public Health Wales, said: "We need to see this level of response continuing in the coming weeks if we are to bring this outbreak under control. We cannot be confident that the outbreak will not continue to grow with so many children still at risk from this very contagious and potentially fatal disease."

More than 900 children received non-routine MMR jabs in GP surgeries, but at least 6000 children remain unvaccinated in Swansea. Public Health Wales has arranged for GPs to give children between 6 and 12 months a vaccination in addition to the scheduled 2-dose vaccination. Dr Marion Lyons said: "There's no adverse effect to this extra jab, and those children would still need to receive the recommended 2 doses at 13 months and 3 years and 4 months of age." Measles cases continue to be reported across Wales.

Following reported outbreaks of measles in some states, the Lagos State Government over the weekend advised residents to be vigilant and report any suspected cases, dead or alive, to the nearest health facility in the state or the directorate of disease control in the state Ministry of Health without delay.

Commissioner for Health Dr Jide Idris, who spoke on behalf of the government, explained that the reported outbreak of the disease called for immediate action. He said there was need for mothers and caregivers to take measures that would reduce the risk of their children contracting the disease.

Such measures include: Exclusive breastfeeding of babies for the 1st 6 months; routine immunization of children and ensuring that the schedule is completed by the child's 1st birthday (measles vaccine at 9 months); ensuring the administration of Vitamin A from the age of 6 months; and the keeping of a sick child at home away from school and play to rest and prevent infecting other children.

He said: "If measles is suspected in any child, his/her mother or caregiver should ensure regular and thorough hand washing of her hands, ensure that such a child receives vaccine before leaving the hospital if not covered with immunization, cleanse all contaminated materials and objects including toys, and return to the hospital for follow up, while health workers are advised to be on the alert and report more than usual cases of measles in their facilities to the Ministry of Health."

Idris explained that immunization was key to the prevention of the disease, stressing that people who do not vaccinate their children put other children at risk and urged the people to take responsibility for their health and call 08160070600 or 08023213333 for any case of the disease.

He added that signs and symptoms of suspected measles include high fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes. The appearance of whitish spots in the mouth and rashes that spread from the head to the rest of the body strongly suggest measles," Idris stated.

Another fatal outbreak of measles has claimed 4 lives in the province of Punjab. The children died in the Meo hospital of the provincial capital Lahore on Saturday [13 Apr 2013]. According to hospital sources, the ages of the infants ranged from 2 to 4 years, and they belonged to the Rawi road and Mari Pora areas.

The total number of lives lost to measles in Lahore has increased to 40, while the number of those affected in the province has risen to 8350.

In a deadly outbreak last year [2012], a large number of lives were lost due primarily to a lack of appropriate vaccination in the country.

South Australia [SA] Health is warning Adelaide residents to be alert for measles over the next 2 weeks. A 13-month-old boy who acquired the virus overseas has become the state's 3rd confirmed case of the highly infectious illness this year [2013]. Chief medical officer Professor Paddy Phillips said SA Health had already been in contact with a number of people who were exposed to the infected child.

"Measles is highly contagious among people who are not fully immunised and is spread through coughing and sneezing," Prof Phillips said. "The illness begins with fever, cough, runny nose, and sore eyes, followed by a rash which begins on the head and then spreads down the body."

Anyone on board Emirates flight EK440, which arrived in Adelaide at 8:42 pm on Friday [5 Apr 2013], and anyone in the airport until 11:30 pm that night should be alert for symptoms. Anyone in the Women's and Children's Hospital emergency department between 11:00 am and 5:30 pm should also be alert.

Prof Phillips said anyone who falls ill over the next 2 weeks should visit their doctor. "It is very important that people phone their GP ahead of any visit and mention why they are attending so that precautions can be taken to avoid spreading disease to others," he said. GPs have also been alerted to the case.

The UK remains in the embarrassing position of being "the sick man of Europe," a position 1st held by the Ottoman Empire. It is to be hoped that the intensive programme of vaccination will be extended to the rest of the country and become a campaign to eradicate disease throughout the UK. - Mod.CP]
