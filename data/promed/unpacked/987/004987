[1] Chikungunya outbreak confirmed

On [Sun 23 Sep 2018] the children's ward, laboratory, and pharmacy at Kassala Teaching Hospital were closed after two children vomited blood. One of the children died.

On [Mon 24 Sep 2018], Prime Minister Moutaz Mousa visited several health centres in the eastern and western parts of Kassala, including Haiel Arab, Sikka Hadeed, and El Hidaya centre in El Khatamiya. He issued a decision to send 2 tons of pesticides and instructed the sanitation of the environment to be addressed.

Adam Jamaa, the governor of Kassala, admitted the existence of daily deaths in the state, but he claims that they are "unrelated to the disease". He confirmed that 10 900 infections have been diagnosed. Eleven days ago, Governor Jamaa acknowledged the death of 7 people from chikungunya fever, and that more than 6000 people have been infected in the recently confirmed outbreak of the virus.

According to unofficial statistics issued by the popular committees that oversee the provision of graves and coffins 25 people are dying per week.

A number of residents said that the authorities should have declared Kassala as a disaster area, so that activities to address the disease and prevent the spread would be carried out at national and international levels.

Chikungunya, in Sudan popularly known as kankasha, is a virus transmitted by the same kinds of mosquitoes that spread dengue and Zika virus. It is characterised by an abrupt onset of fever, frequently accompanied by joint pain.

Speaking to Radio Dabanga, Ibrahim Mohamed Nur El Sheikh demanded that schools be closed so that the number of infected would be reduced. "People have stopped the work in Kassala although it is the main market for the surrounding countryside."

El Sheikh said that although there have been initiatives and appeals to confront the crisis from in and out of Sudan, they did not notice any activity to provide medical or humanitarian assistance to affected people by any party.

On social media platforms, activists and others have gathered to comment on the situation. On Twitter for example the hashtag #KassalaIsDying is being used (#كسلا_تحتضر).

The federal Ministry of Health has confirmed the outbreak of the virus chikungunya in Kassala. Noteworthy is that Kassala declared a State of Emergency starting December 2017, justifying the measure by claiming that the state can better combat human trafficking and the smuggling of consumer goods.

The authorities in Sennar have declared a state of alert to counter the spread of the chikungunya fever, after it recently appeared in El Gedaref state. Sanitary measures have been taken for travel buses and the first awareness campaigns have been set-up.

The director-general of the Sennar Teaching Hospital said that as there is no cure for the disease, he called upon people to use mosquito nets in their homes.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Mubarak for this important update on the current situation. O'nyong nyong virus (ONNV), is a mosquito-borne Alphavirus that is primarily transmitted through the bite of _Anopheles funestus_ and _Anopheles gambiae_ mosquitoes; which are also malaria parasite vectors in Africa. The virus, first isolated in Uganda in 1959, is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and has caused several major outbreaks both in West and East Africa. ONNV fever, characterized by severe arthralgia, is similar to chikungunya fever, with the exception of cervical lymphadenitis, which is peculiar to the former. Prevention measures are similar to those adopted against other vector borne disease transmission. - Mod.UBA]

The official Sudanese government stated that the current outbreak is chikungunya and it has been going on since August 2018. The well-known professor Dr. Tag-Eldin Mohamed, stated that testing was done in samples from patients there and the results indicated chikungunya. However, this report was last August [2018].

Upon review with the local health provider by our source, there are 2 types of virological diseases spreading. The 1st one with symptoms and signs similar to chikungunya, and the 2nd one looks like hemorrhagic fever mainly in children and elderly patients.

The start of the disease was in the west part of Gash River, with a daily cases estimate of 100-200 cases (per day), that now decreased to 50 cases as of last week [17 Sep 2018]. Cases have now spread to the east part of the Gash River with approximately 100 cases per day. Currently there is no available testing and the diagnosis is purely clinical.

The local ministry of health has declared an outbreak of chikungunya.
