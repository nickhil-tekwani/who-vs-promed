Foot-and-mouth spreads to state-run livestock center
----------------------------------------------------
The highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has spread to a
state-run livestock and veterinary science institute in the central
part of the country, the government confirmed Saturday [01 May 2010].
The outbreak at the research center in South Chungcheong Province
raising some 1540 "hanwoo" beef cattle and hogs is the 10th outbreak
since April 2010 [caused by FMDV serotype O], said the Ministry for
Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

It said one breeding sow at the center located in Cheongyang some 160
km [100 miles] south of Seoul showed symptoms such as blisters on her
nose, mouth and teats late Friday [30 Apr 2010], with preliminary
test kit results coming up positive for antigens.

"No antibodies were found, indicating the sow had been infected in
the last few days," an official said. He said all animals within a
500-meter [547-yard] radius of the farm will be destroyed to prevent
the further outbreak of the disease, with authorities to decide if
the "danger zone" should be extended to 3km [1.6 miles] from the site.

On-site inspectors had ordered culling of the animals at the center
that was built to raise and improve quality of pigs and cattle for
distribution to local farmers. Quarantine control and decontamination
efforts carried out at the site are much more stringent than normal
farms, raising concerns that the nationwide effort to contain the
disease may not be effective.

The exact cause has yet to be determined, but the outbreak is the 1st
in the province, an indication that the disease is spreading
throughout the country. Cheongyang is 96km [60 miles] from the site
of the nearest outbreak, which was reported 21 Apr 2010.

Outbreaks reported since last month were concentrated on Ganghwa
Island and Gimpo west of Seoul, with one isolated case reported for
Chungju in the country's interior. FMD outbreaks [caused by a
different serotype, FMDV-A] reported in January 2010 were in the
Pocheon and Yeoncheon regions north of the capital city in Gyeonggi Province.

FMD affects all cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle, hogs, deer,
goats and buffalo. Countries that report the disease are barred from
exporting meat from cloven-hoofed animals.

South Korea has confirmed a total of 16 cases of FMD this year. with
the latest one reported Wednesday [28 Apr 2010] at a hog farm located
west of Seoul. [The 16 cases/outbreaks should be regarded as 2
separate epizootics; see further].

The government had ordered the culling of more than 49 000 animals.
As of late last month, compensation paid by the government to farmers
topped 64.0 billion won (USD 57.1 million).

The farm ministry has effectively been on the highest alert level to
contain the disease.

Officials, meanwhile, said the latest outbreaks must be viewed
separately from the outbreaks in January, noting the wide time gap
and the fact that the latest cases involve a different strain of the
virus. All outbreaks confirmed in the 1st month of the year were of
the A-Type strain, while those reported this month are O-Type, which
spreads more quickly through swine.

[The 1st 2010 epizootic of FMD in S. Korea, caused by FMDV-A, started
on 2 Jan 2010 and was declared resolved on 11 Mar 2010. It affected
only cattle and included 7 outbreaks, the respective locations of
which shown on the map available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8828>.

The 2nd, current epizootic, caused by FMDV-O, started on 8 Apr 2010
and its spread, in cattle and swine, is continuing in spite of the
rigorous control measures. These 2 epizootics should be seen as being
caused by 2 separate, independent introductions of different viruses.

are available at

[For further details, including a table of the 10 reference strains
most related to "O/Ganghwa/KOR/2010", subscribers may refer to the
above URL. Similarly to the serotype O isolates from Hong Kong, the
reference strain found most related to the S.Korean strain is
"O/MYA/7/98 (DQ164925)".

According to the results of this test, the South Korean strain is
closely related to the Hong Kong strain, which may be regarded as
representing the serotype O virus circulating in China since early
2010 (or earlier?!).

In case the spread of the virus is continued, the South Korean
authorities may eventually have to consider the application of
vaccination. So far, they have refrained from doing so in order to
enable an early regaining of the FMD-free status. - Mod.AS]
