A 19th victim of an outbreak of deadly Legionnaires' disease has died, and
the number of people confirmed to have been infected has risen to 106, the
Health Ministry said Friday.
More deaths appeared likely after 12 additional cases of infection were
confirmed Thursday. The number of people suffering from unconfirmed
symptoms similar to those of the pneumonia-like illness stood unchanged at
231, the ministry said.
All those infected with the bacteria attended a flower show last month in
Bovenkarspel, 40 miles north of Amsterdam.
However, health officials are still pondering the exact source, and a
warm-water whirlpool has become the focus of investigations. The whirlpool
was part of a consumer products show held alongside the Westfriese Flora
event.
An estimated 80,000 people attended the flower show, the largest of its
kind in the Netherlands, which does a booming export business in bulbs and
cut flowers.
Legionnaires' disease first surfaced in 1976 at a convention of the
American Legion in Pennsylvania, where 220 of the 4,000 people attending
were infected and 34 died.
The bacteria that are believed to cause the illness are found in soil and
thrive in air-conditioning ducts, storage tanks and rivers. Experts say the
[bacterium, spread through the air via tiny water particles, kills one of
every six people it infects.
