Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome - Vermont, 2000
---------------------------------------------
In 1993, an outbreak of an unexplained pulmonary illness occurred in the
southwestern United States. This outbreak led to the first description of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a rodent-borne hantaviral infection.
Hantaviruses have been found in rodents in rural areas throughout the United
States, but most infection has occurred in the southwest (1,2). This report
describes the first HPS case in Vermont and underscores the importance of
preventing exposure to peridomestic rodents and recognizing the signs and
symptoms of HPS.
On 17 Feb 2000, a 61-year-old previously healthy Vermont resident was
hospitalized following 3 syncopal episodes and 1 week of chills, fever (<102
F ([<39 C), nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and right knee pain. Upon
admission, the patient's temperature was 99.3 F (37.4 C), pulse rate was 90
beats per minute, and blood pressure was 135/90 mm Hg. On examination, the
lungs were clear to auscultation, a 2 x 2 cm nontender lymph node was
identified at the angle of the left jaw, and a mild effusion was present in
the right knee. A complete blood count included a hematocrit of 55.6%
(normal: 36%--52%), a platelet count of 99,000/mm3 (normal:
150,000--400,000/mm3), and a white blood cell count of 6900/mm3 (normal:
4,000--10,000/mm3) with 83% granulocytes, 8.0% lymphocytes, and 8.0%
monocytes. Chest radiographs were clear without infiltrates. However, 1 day
after admission, the patient's condition deteriorated with onset of
respiratory failure, profound hypoxemia, and hypotension requiring
mechanical ventilation. Subsequent chest radiographs revealed bilateral
interstitial edema consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS). The patient also developed disseminated intravascular coagulation
and renal insufficiency (peak blood urea nitrogen: 62 mg/dL [normal: 7--18
mg/dL and peak creatinine 2.9 mg/dL [normal: 0.5--1.4 mg/dL). After 23
days in the hospital, including 16 days in intensive care, the patient was
discharged with a diagnosis of ARDS and sepsis of uncertain etiology.
During the 2 months preceding hospitalization, the patient, who resided in a
house on 4 rural acres, had cleaned a mouse nest from a woodpile, observed
mice in the basement, and trapped 2 mice under the kitchen counters. The
patient's reported symptoms and exposure to rodents led to the collection of
2 serum specimens on 6 and 17 Apr 2000, which were submitted to CDC for
hantavirus diagnostic testing. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,
immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin G (IgG), antibodies to Sin Nombre
virus were detected; these antibodies indicated recent hantavirus infection
(3).
During an onsite investigation conducted on 21 Apr 2000 by the Vermont
Department
of Health, mice droppings were observed under the kitchen counter and in the
cellar. In April and May, the wildlife services program of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture trapped rodents within a 5-mile radius of the
patient's house to estimate the prevalence of hantavirus infection in local
rodent populations. After 1632 trapnights (i.e., number of traps times the
number of nights), 46 rodents were captured, including 6 deer mice
(_Peromyscus maniculatus_), 13 white-footed mice (_P. leucopus_), 21
woodland jumping mice (_Napaeozapus insignis_), one meadow jumping mouse
(_Zapus hudsonius_), four chipmunks (_Tamias striatus_), and one vole
(_Microtus_ sp.). Because cases of hantavirus infection are new among humans
and the rodent reservoir is not well described, especially in the northeast,
most of these rodents were tested serologically at CDC for hantaviral
antibodies. Among 43 rodents tested, 2 of 5 deer mice were positive for
hantaviral antibodies; all other rodents were negative.

MMWR Editorial Note:
This report describes the first case of HPS acquired in New England; only 15
(5%) of the 284 cases confirmed by CDC have occurred east of the Mississippi
River. Hantaviruses known to cause HPS in the United States include Sin
Nombre, New York, Monongahela, Bayou, and Black Creek Canal viruses. Because
rodent species that host one or more viruses are found throughout the
contiguous United States, sporadic cases may occur anywhere on the mainland
(4). Among approximately 115 (75%) of 153 patients with documented exposure
to rodents or rodent droppings, exposure had occurred in and around the
house. In Vermont, the primary rodent reservoirs of these hantaviruses are
likely to be the deer mouse (_P. maniculatus_) and the white-footed mouse
(_P. leucopus_). Other rodent species known to carry HPS-associated
hantaviruses include the rice rat (_Oryzomys palustris_) and cotton rat
(_Sigmodon hispidus_) (5,6).
Although it was not reported in the 1993 outbreak (2), renal impairment is a
component of disease associated with Sin Nombre viral infection and related
viruses, as indicated in the case in this report. Renal impairment also has
been predominant in disease caused by Black Creek Canal and Bayou viruses.
Another component recognized since the first outbreak is disease accompanied
by frank hemorrhage (7).
The case described in this report demonstrates the importance of considering
hantavirus infection when diagnosing an unexplained acute respiratory
distress syndrome or bilateral interstitial pulmonary infiltrates (8).
Although the Vermont patient had symptoms unrelated to hantavirus infection
(e.g., a nontender lymph node and knee pain), other signs, symptoms, and
environmental circumstances suggested HPS. When patients may have been
exposed to rodents or rodent droppings, especially in and around the house,
clinicians should request serologic testing to detect hantavirus-specific
IgM and IgG. Information about testing is available from local or state
health departments, and testing is available at CDC.
