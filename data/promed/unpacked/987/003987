Abstract
---------
Some variants of SARS-CoV-2 are associated with increased transmissibility, increased disease severity, or decreased vaccine effectiveness (VE). In this population-based cohort study (n=4 204 859) the delta variant was identified in 5430 (0.13%) individuals, of whom 84 were admitted to hospital. VE against laboratory-confirmed infection with the delta variant was 22.4% among partly vaccinated (95% confidence interval (CI): 17.0-27.4) and 64.6% (95% CI: 60.6-68.2) among fully vaccinated individuals compared with 54.5% (95% CI: 50.4-58.3) and 84.4% (95% CI: 81.8-86.5) against the alpha variant.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To the editor: We read with interest the article by Harder et al. who reported on the interim results (from 1 Jan-14 May 2021) of their living systematic review on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine efficacy/effectiveness (VE) in preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections [1]. Notably, data on VE against asymptomatic infections in 7 of 30 studies were discussed. We argue that additional clinical data on asymptomatic infection could have been extracted from 2 of the included studies.

For VE against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were no data on the Vaxzevria vaccine (ChAdOx1-S, AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom (UK)) described in Table 2. However, in the randomised controlled trial by Emary et al. as listed in Table 1, the VE of Vaxzevria vaccine at 2 weeks or more after the 2nd dose against asymptomatic or unknown infection in the UK was 28.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): -77.1-71.4) for the SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant (phylogenetic assignment of named global outbreak (Pango) lineage designation B.1.1.7) and 69.7% (95% CI: 33.0-86.3) for other variants, mainly the B.1.177 variant [2]. One could argue the CI were wide and overlapping since 3/4 of the patients had no sequencing data, and those cases of infection with unknown symptoms may have had minor symptoms. Therefore, the significance of VE data was debatable.

In another study reported by Dagan et al., also included in Table 1, the VE of the Comirnaty vaccine (BioNTech, Mainz, Germany/Pfizer, Puurs, Belgium) against asymptomatic infection was estimated to be 29% (95% CI: 17-39) at 14-20 days after the 1st dose, 52% (95% CI: 41-60) at 21-27 days after the 1st dose, and 90% (95% CI: 83-94) at one week or later after the 2nd dose [3]. This study included 1 193 236 participants, more than any other study listed in Table 2, and was the only matched case-control study available for the VE against asymptomatic infection.

In addition, in the sponsor briefing of the Spikevax (mRNA-1273, Moderna, Cambridge, United States (US)) vaccine presented to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 17 Dec 2020, the VE against asymptomatic infection was 63.3% (95% CI: 32.3-80.1) after the 1st dose in the vaccinated group (14/14,134, 0.099%) versus in the placebo group (38/14 073, 0.270%) [4]. This document is available on the FDA website. Since the assessment report on the Janssen vaccine (Janssen-Cilag International, Beerse, Belgium) by the European Medical Agency (EMA) was included in this systematic review, we believe that the FDA document for the Moderna vaccine would also be worth considering until formal analysis is available.

We appreciate the efforts by the authors to conduct this living systematic review. While the main SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern in the majority of studies during the report period was the alpha variant, rather than the currently widespread delta variant, continued efforts to collect the effectiveness data of current COVID-19 vaccines are welcome.

Citation: Harder T, Koch J, Vygen-Bonnet S, et al. Efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection: interim results of a living systematic review, 1 Jan to 14 May 2021. Euro Surveill. 2021; 26(28): pii=2100563; https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.28.2100563.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection plays a key role in the containment of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. All vaccines approved by the European Medical Agency (EMA) at the time of writing demonstrated high vaccine efficacy/effectiveness (VE) against severe COVID-19. With vaccination programmes being implemented in most European countries, it becomes urgent to assess the extent to which these vaccines are also able to prevent symptomatic and asymptomatic infections to guide public health recommendations and develop strategies for fully vaccinated people.

In December 2020, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), in collaboration with the National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) network coordinated by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), initiated a living systematic review on the VE and safety of European Union (EU)-licensed COVID-19 vaccines (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020208935). In this paper, only efficacy and effectiveness data, but not those on safety, will be covered. In detail, we report the interim results of the review focusing on 2 research questions:
- What is the efficacy/effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections (irrespective of whether those infected were symptomatic or asymptomatic)?
- What is the efficacy/effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in preventing asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections?

Discussion
-----------
These interim results of a living systematic review show that after completed course, the EMA-approved COVID-19 vaccines have a VE of 80% to 90% in preventing SARS-CoV2 infections, including asymptomatic ones. We found some indication that VE estimates are not reduced in cases infected with variant of concern (VOC) alpha (phylogenetic assignment of named global outbreak (Pango) lineage designation B.1.1.7); however, these results should be interpreted with caution. VE against infection can also be regarded as an indicator of how well a vaccine prevents transmission. In addition, studies suggest that persons who become SARS-CoV-2-positive despite vaccination had a shorter duration of virus shedding and lower viral load [8].

Conclusions
-----------
Results of this living systematic review imply that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections, including those which are asymptomatic. From a public health perspective, it can be concluded that fully vaccinated persons might in some instances still become PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 but only play a minor role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

To the editor: We would like to thank the authors of the letter for their valuable comments on our article [1]. We would like to respond briefly to each point.

In the post-hoc analysis of the Vaxzevria (ChAdOx1-S, AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom) licensure trial by Emary et al. [2], the secondary outcome was named 'asymptomatic infections and infection with unknown symptoms.' Since the outcome description was imprecise, we decided to exclude these data from our report. We agree with the authors of the letter that because of wide and overlapping confidence intervals, the relevance of Emary et al.'s findings is unclear.

Dagan et al. [3] reported a supplementary analysis that included cases without documented symptoms. We decided not to take these results into account since the authors of this paper themselves recognised that their approach is 'an imperfect proxy for asymptomatic infections (since mild symptoms may not be documented).'

We agree with the authors of the letter that documents submitted to regulatory authorities are valuable sources of information until formal publications are available. In fact, we used the European Medicines Agency (EMA) report on the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (Janssen-Cilag International, Beerse, Belgium) because of the lack of published evidence on this particular vaccine. As suggested by the authors, we will consider this approach in future updates of this living systematic review also for other vaccines.

Finally, we are also in agreement that the widespread circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (phylogenetic assignment of named global outbreak (Pango) lineage designation B.1.617.2) calls for an update of this living systematic review. We are currently in the process of summarising data on the vaccine effectiveness against this particular variant and hope to make them publicly available soon.

[3] Vaccination for 12-15-year-old children
[A] JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation)
Date: Fri 3 Sep 2021
Source: BBC [edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/health-58438669


The JCVI [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation] said children were at such a low risk from the virus that jabs would offer only a marginal benefit.

The UK's 4 chief medical officers have now been asked to have the final say, and to consider the wider impact on schools and society. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said a decision would be made shortly.

The JCVI did advise widening the existing vaccine programme to include an extra 200 000 teenagers with specific underlying conditions.

Doctors identified that children with chronic heart, lung, and liver conditions were at much higher risk of COVID than healthy children.


The decision not to recommend the vaccine to all healthy children was based on concern over an extremely rare side effect of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that causes heart inflammation and can lead to palpitations and chest pain.

Data from the US, where millions of young teenagers have been vaccinated, suggests there are 60 cases of the heart condition for every million 2nd doses given to 12-17-year-old boys (compared to 8 in one million girls).

France, Italy, Israel, and Ireland are also offering the vaccine to all children in this age group.

But as children are at such low risk from the virus, the JCVI decided that vaccination would offer only "marginal gain," and, therefore, there was "insufficient" evidence to offer mass vaccination to this age group.

The JCVI said it was difficult to factor in long COVID in its advice because of the uncertainty over how common it is in children, although it appears to be less prevalent than in adults.

The vaccine advisers have been under huge pressure.

Ministers have let it be known they are very keen on getting this age group vaccinated, both through their public pronouncements and privately behind the scenes.

This has caused frustration among JCVI members, with some complaining about the habit of government officials sitting in on meetings.

Despite this, the JCVI has stood firm. Taking into account the impact on school disruption might make a difference.

But even then, it's not clear-cut. Vaccinating kids will cause disruption in itself, with children having to leave class to get jabbed and then maybe needing time off to recover from the common side effects, such as fever.

Another argument put forward is that it could help reduce the wider spread of the virus, although encouraging the 6 million adults who have not even taken up the offer of a jab yet could arguably make more of a difference.

Clearly, though it would have some impact, although the emergence of the delta variant means the vaccines offer less protection against infection than they did previously.

What's more, around half of children in this age group are thought to have had COVID, providing them with natural immunity anyway.

The judgement call remains very tough.

Prof Wei Shen Lim, chairman of COVID immunisation for the JCVI, said it was "taking a precautionary approach."

"The margin of benefit is considered too small to support universal COVID-19 vaccination for this age group at this time.

"The committee will continue to review safety data as they emerge," he added.

Paediatricians say that healthy children with COVID end up in intensive care at a rate of 2 in one million, but this rises to 100 in one million for children with certain health problems.

As a result, the JCVI's advice is that a larger group of at-risk children aged 12-15 should be offered a vaccine.

They include children with the following conditions: blood cancers, sickle cell disease, type 1 diabetes, and congenital heart disease

Children with poorly controlled asthma and other respiratory conditions that can result in severe illness from COVID should also be offered the vaccine, the JCVI said.

A group of 150 000 children with conditions such as severe neurodisabilities, Down's syndrome, and severely weakened immune systems as well as those living with vulnerable adults are already eligible.

There are 3 million children in total in this age group across the UK.

Mr Javid said he had written to the chief medical officers in the UK's 4 nations to ask them to consider the vaccination of all 12-15-year-olds "from a broader perspective."

They will look at the effects of COVID on children's education and pupil absences from school, which the JCVI is not qualified to consider.

Senior leaders in clinical and public health will be involved in the discussions and help to inform a final decision on a rollout to all 12-15-year-olds.

"We will then consider the advice, building on the advice from the JCVI, before making a decision shortly," Mr Javid said.

On Friday [3 Sep 2021], 42 076 cases of coronavirus were reported in the UK and 121 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

The decision to not vaccinate 12-15-year-old children could be extremely disruptive to the classroom as children get infected naturally. Not vaccinating also will allow more rampant spread of the virus with the opening of schools. The decision to vaccinate or not rests on a risk:benefit determination: the risk to a child's health is greater without vaccination; the benefits are greater with vaccination with only minimal risk. - Mod.LK]

[B] Minister's response
Date: Fri 3 Sep 2021

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/03/uk-rules-out-covid-vaccinations-for-children


Ministers could for the 1st time defy the advice of their official vaccine advisers and push ahead with COVID jabs for all 12-15-year-olds, after the scientific body concluded the net health benefit in vaccinating the age group was too small.

In a move that highlights a growing divide between government and scientific advisers over the next phase of the vaccination programme, ministers will seek extra evidence that may help overturn the watchdog's verdict.

In a statement on Friday [3 Sep 2021], after days of speculation, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said that while the health gains from vaccinating the entire age group were greater than the risks, "the margin of benefit is considered too small to support universal vaccination of healthy 12-15-year-olds at this time."

Instead, the committee recommended an expansion to an existing programme of vaccinations for older children with health conditions, including heart disease, type 1 diabetes, and severe asthma, increasing the eligible cohort to about 200 000.

The decision came as a blow to the government, which has in recent days both quietly agitated for a decision from the JCVI, given most schools in England have returned this week, and pointed to existing mass vaccination programmes for such children in places including Israel, the US, and Germany.

However, in a tacit invitation to overrule its own recommendation, the JCVI stressed that because its remit does not include wider issues such as disruption to schools, ministers could consider seeking separate advice on this, an unprecedented suggestion by the organisation.

"This isn't the JCVI saying no," said a government source. "They've said there is a marginal benefit, but as they make clear, they're assessing it from a very narrow view."

Immediately after the JCVI announcement, Sajid Javid, the health secretary and his counterparts in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland wrote to the chief medical officers in their countries, asking them to "consider the matter from a broader perspective."

While officials stress they will wait for the verdict, it remains very possible that the JCVI's recommendation is overturned. "We don't want to prejudge it, but vaccinations for all 12-15-year-olds is very much still on the table," another government source said.

It does, however, add more delay to a plan that ministers had hoped to begin as schools returned, with the chief medical officers expected to meet next week, with expectations they could need "several days" to assess the evidence.

Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he was pleased that "the door appears to have been left open" for the government to go ahead with vaccinations for more school-age children.

"The trouble is that time is pressing, the autumn term is upon us, and we really do need a decision," Barton said. "We simply cannot have another term in which there is major educational disruption."

There was vehement criticism from other scientists of the JCVI's decision, which is understood to have been reached via a majority vote at a meeting on Thursday [2 Sep 2021].

Dr Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist from Queen Mary University of London, called the move "completely shocking."

"They are recklessly endangering children's health based on ideology rather than science," Gurdasani said. "The benefits of vaccination overwhelmingly outweigh the risks; this has been clear for a while. Yet, as more than 12 million children have been vaccinated across the globe, and 47% fully vaccinated in France, with many European countries close to this target, JCVI has taken an exceptional stance with absolutely no scientific justification."

One risk raised by the JCVI was the chance of myocarditis, a form of heart inflammation, in children who receive the vaccine. While this is extremely rare, and children tend to recover quickly, there was uncertainty about any longer-term effects, with further research needed, it said.

But Lawrence Young, a virologist from the University of Warwick, said the risk of developing myocarditis was "significantly higher for those youngsters who have contracted COVID-19 compared to those who have been vaccinated with the Pfizer jab."

"This is a very disappointing and worrying decision," he added.

Coronavirus infections in Scotland, where schools returned a fortnight ago, have risen to their highest level since estimates began last autumn, new figures showed, with one in 75 people thought to have COVID last week, up from one in 140 the previous week.

While the figure for England, around one in 70 people, is unchanged from the previous week, ministers are aware that the return of schools could change this.

Separately, the JCVI still has to decide on the issue of 3rd, "booster" jabs, and whether these should be universal or aimed only at older or more clinically vulnerable people. A decision is expected next week, after the release of results from a study on the issue.

While no ministers have publicly criticised the JCVI, there is frustration at its pace of decision-making. On Friday [3 Sep 2021], the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said ministers should consider rolling out booster injections even without a green light from the watchdog.
