With all the news surrounding the death of a Kerala state, India child from Nipah virus earlier this week [http://outbreaknewstoday.com/nipah-virus-kerala-health-minister-veena-george-said-this-is-the-third-time-its-affected-the-state-49770/], the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) just updated their Nipah case count for 2021.

According to their data, 2 Nipah virus cases have been reported in Bangladesh this year [2021], down from 6 in 2020.

No deaths were recorded and no details were released about the patients, the dates or their location.

This brings Bangladesh's Nipah totals since 2001 to 321 cases and 225 deaths, accounting for a 70% fatality rate.

Nipah virus is one of the pathogens in the World Health Organization R&D Blueprint list of epidemic threats needing urgent R&D action. Nipah virus was first identified during an outbreak of disease that took place in Malaysia in 1998. Both animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission have been documented. Well more than 600 cases of Nipah virus human infections have been reported since the Malaysia outbreak. Subsequent outbreaks in India and Bangladesh have occurred with high case fatality.

[Although the number of Nipah virus (NIV) human infections in the above report is small for this year and last, the decline of 6 cases in 2020 to just 2 this year (2021) may reflect a decline in the proportion of NIV infected Indian flying fox bat [_Pteropus medius_] populations, the natural host of the virus, with less transmission of the virus among these bats and little or no spillover of the virus to humans. A study on the dynamics of NIV concludes that when a great enough proportion of bats are immune to the virus there is little transmission but when this fraction drops below a threshold, the whole colony becomes susceptible with subsequent significant virus transmission throughout the colony. This sets the scene for transmission to humans when people consume fruit or palm sap contaminated with NIV by infected bats. Transmission from person to person then may ensue.
