Food poisoning tally set to soar
---------------------------------
The potential toll from a food poisoning outbreak at 2 Turkish restaurants
in Brunswick has soared well beyond 700. More than 720 people have told
health authorities that they fell ill after eating at Alasya Restaurant or
Alasya 2 between 8 and 19 Jan 2005. Authorities believe scores more victims
may have failed to report their illness.
The confirmed tally lags behind at 163, and is certain to increase, as
further results on patients are completed. At least 20 of the food
poisoning victims have been admitted to the hospital, and many more have
been treated in emergency departments then released. At least 5 have tested
positive for salmonella. Department of Human Services spokesman Bram
Alexander said the tally was expected to rise further. "The calls are
people reporting illness to us with a connection to Alasya, and we need to
take them seriously to follow through as part of the investigation," he said.
Diners who ate at Alasya on the weekend before last [15-16 Jan 2005], the
time frame which appears to be the heart of the outbreak, reported the
restaurant was packed. More than 400 callers contacted the Department of
Human Services between Thursday and Friday [20-21 Jan 2005] mornings to
report falling ill. Another 320 called by yesterday afternoon, 24 Jan 2005.
Victims range in age from 18 months to 73 years.
Mr. Alexander said test results on food samples to determine the source of
the outbreak may be available as soon as today [25 Jan 2005]. At least 5
children have been admitted to the Royal Children's Hospital.
Both Sydney Rd. eateries were shut by authorities last Wed 19 Jan 2005.
Neither will be allowed to reopen until authorities are satisfied they are
safe.
