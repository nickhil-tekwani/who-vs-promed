The country has reported 40 845 cases of mucormycosis, or black fungus, during the COVID 2nd wave so far, nearly 85% of which have been seen in coronavirus patients while the fungal disease has already claimed 3129 lives. These figures were shared by Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in a meeting of the group of ministers on COVID on Monday [28 Jun 2021].

Mucormycosis, a rare fungal disease that has reached epidemic proportions over the last few days, is said to be fuelled by the use of steroids, compromised immunity, and diabetes in COVID patients. The disease has caught attention, as it has a high mortality rate and manifests itself severely through stark symptoms on the face, lungs, and brain and often requires complicated surgeries.

The data presented in the Monday [28 Jun 2021] meeting showed that while 34 940 patients, or 85.5% of the total diagnosed with black fungus, had COVID, 26 187, or about 64.11%, were co-morbid for diabetes. Also, 31 444 [70%] of the cases were rhino-orbital in nature, meaning the patients had infection in and around the nasal cavity [and orbit of the eye].

However, only about 21 523 (52.69%) of those infected were on steroids, and the disease distribution age group-wise showed that it struck the highest number of people in the 45-60-year age group, but even younger ones were not spared. For instance, 13 083 patients were in the age group 18-45 (32%), 17 464 were in the age group 45-60 (42%), while 10 082 (24%) patients were 60+ years of age.

During the meeting, ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] director general Balram Bhargava underlined that the 2nd wave has still not subsided, as 80 districts still have high positivity. The official, therefore, advised against any laxity at this stage, while assuring that the existing COVID vaccines have been found effective against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants.

[Mucormycosis, also known as zygomycosis, are infections caused by fungi of the class Zygomycetes, composed of the orders Mucorales and Entomophthorales. The order Mucorales includes genera _Rhizopus_, _Rhizomucor_, _Mucor_, and _Cunninghamella_. These fungi are ubiquitous in the environment, found in soil and decaying vegetable matter. However, they are also found in the hospital environment, being isolated from nonsterile adhesive tape and tongue depressors, and being linked to nosocomial infections (1,1a,2). The clinical spectrum of mucormycosis ranges from cutaneous, rhino-orbital and rhino-orbito-cerebral, and sinopulmonary, to disseminated infections, which are frequently fatal, especially in immunocompromised hosts.

Most human infections result from inhalation of fungal spores that have been released in the air or from direct inoculation of organisms into disrupted skin or mucosa. Although individuals are exposed to these fungi on a daily basis, usually only people with weakened immune systems or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus develop infections due to these organisms. However, contamination of devitalized tissue following traumatic injuries sustained during tornados, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions can result in mucormycosis even without underlying risk factors (3). For example, 15 immunocompetent patients from India were described as having necrotizing fasciitis due to predominantly aseptate broad hyphae with wide angle branching, consistent with the morphology of zygomyces species; of the 8 cases cultured, 5 were positive for _Apophysomyces elegans_, a member of the order Mucorales (4). Also, a man from Sri Lanka injured in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami developed a necrotizing wound infection from which _A. elegans_ was cultured; histology showed mucormycosis in excised wound tissue (5).

Nosocomial mucormycosis has been associated with a variety of healthcare-associated procedures or devices, such as cutaneous infection related to the direct inoculation of the fungus on the wound or skin surface, usually from contaminated wound bandages, contaminated karaya (a plant-derived adhesive used for ostomy bags), or contaminated medication patches. Mucormycosis has also followed use of contaminated wooden tongue depressors to prepare oral medications given to patients through a nasogastric tube or to construct splints for intravenous and arterial cannulation sites, and aerosolized fungal spores in ventilatory systems as a result of construction (6). In another nosocomial outbreak, water damage to a linen store and patient shower room promoted fungal growth, which contaminated the surrounding air that circulated in close proximity to the infected patients' rooms (7). Nosocomial gastrointestinal mucormycosis has followed ingestion of contaminated food or medications (see the "see alsos" below).

These organisms characteristically are angioinvasive, often leading to thrombosis, infarction of involved tissues, septic embolization, and dissemination. Mucormycosis can have a rapid and often fatal clinical course. The diagnosis of mucormycosis almost always requires histopathologic evidence of fungal invasion of the tissues. Culturing these organisms from an infected site is rarely sufficient to establish the diagnosis, because the fungus may colonize tissue without causing infection and is a relatively frequent laboratory contaminant.

The pre-COVID prevalence of mucormycosis in India is high, approximately 0.14 cases per 1000 population, about 80 times the prevalence in developed countries (8), and India is home to 77 million diabetics, 2nd highest to China with 11 million diabetics (9), which may explain the high incidence of mucormycosis in India (diabetes mellitus being a major risk factor for mucormycosis). Most cases of COVID-associated mucormycosis (CAM) have been reported from India, where it is occurring in 0.27% of hospitalized COVID patients (10). Although poorly controlled diabetes mellitus is the most common risk factor among CAM patients, 1/3rd of CAM cases are reported to have no underlying predisposition, other than COVID (11). Severe COVID-19 is treated with high doses of steroids, and improper glucocorticoid use in COVID-19 (e.g., use of glucocorticoids in mild COVID-19 cases (without hypoxaemia) or the utilization of higher doses of glucocorticoids) has been found to be an additional risk factor in CAM in India (12).

The fungi gain entry via inhalation into the paranasal sinuses and then spread to the sphenoid sinus, palate, orbit, and cavernous sinus. Mucormycosis usually develops 10-14 days after hospitalization for severe COVID. Perhaps mucor-contaminated swabs used for COVID PCR testing, done on admission to the hospital or as an outpatient, introduced fungal organisms into the nasal cavity at the time of testing. Mucormycosis that presents before a diagnosis of COVID is made appears unusual (13).
