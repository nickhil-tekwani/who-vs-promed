UK pet owners will soon be allowed to take their cats and dogs abroad on
holiday after research by government-appointed scientists found that
anti-rabies vaccine can give better protection against the spread of the
virus than quarantine. If the findings are implemented, domestic cats and
dogs which have been vaccinated and certified will no longer have to be
looked after by friends or go into kennels when the family goes abroad.
Only pet owners travelling between rabies-free countries would be allowed
to take their pets without quarantine. They would need proof that their dog
or cat had been vaccinated. For the past 28 years, no animal carrying
rabies has reached Britain.
The confidential report has been sent to Nick Brown, the agriculture
minister, who is due to make an announcement shortly. The findings are
expected to lead to a radical change in policy. The report discusses the
merits of a phased introduction of a vaccination scheme at certain ports so
that the effects can be closely monitored. The government decided last
November to settle the long-running dispute over quarantine controls by
appointing a team of scientists to assess the arguments for and against
maintaining the existing six-month quarantine arrangements.
Some MPs and vets argued that quarantine had protected Britain against
rabies since 1901 and that it should be continued. Those lobbying for
change said scientific advances could provide effective safeguards through
vaccination and certification. And in Sweden, where quarantine was scrapped
in favour of vaccination three years ago, the cross-border movement of pets
increased up to 100-fold but there have been no cases of rabies.
The government asked Ian Kennedy, professor of health law at University
College, London, to chair the committee. It found that vaccine administered
several months before the pet travelled, coupled with stringent checks,
could be safer than quarantine. That was because rabies sometimes took
longer than six months to develop. The scientists were also concerned that
existing quarantine controls were routinely flouted by pet owners who were
determined to smuggle their animals into the country.
The committee asked Dr Chris Dye, one of its members and Europe's leading
authority on the epidemiology of rabies, to carry out a risk assessment of
scrapping the six-month controls. The work was independently assessed
earlier this year by Dr Stuart MacDiarmid, a scientist with the New Zealand
government where quarantine controls were relaxed in March 1995. MacDiarmid
said the Kennedy committee's assessment showed that anti-rabies vaccines
would reduce the risk. Dye refused to discuss the conclusions of the
Kennedy committee.
