Dual parasitic infections deadly to marine mammals
--------------------------------------------------
A study of tissue samples from 161 marine mammals that died between
2004 and 2009 in the Pacific Northwest reveals an association between
severe illness and co-infection with 2 kinds of parasites normally
found in land animals. One, _Sarcocystis neurona_, is a newcomer to
the northwest coastal region of North America and is not known to
infect people, while the other, _Toxoplasma gondii_, has been
established there for some time and caused a large outbreak of disease
in people in 1995.

Scientists from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health,
collaborated with investigators in Washington state and Canada in the
research, published online 24 May 2011 in the open-access journal PLoS
[Public Library of Science] Neglected Tropical Diseases [see reference
below].

Toxoplasmosis, the illness caused by _T. gondii_ infection, is
generally not serious in otherwise healthy people, but the parasites
can cause severe or fatal disease in people with compromised immune
systems and can also damage the fetuses of pregnant women. The
parasites are globally distributed and enter water via infected cat
feces.

"Chlorination does not kill _T. gondii_, but filtration eliminates
them from the water supply," noted lead researcher Michael Grigg, PhD,
of the NIAID Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases. Although _S. neurona_
parasites do not infect people, other closely related species of
_Sarcocystis_ parasites do. "The public health message here is that
people can easily avoid the parasites by filtering or boiling
untreated water. Limiting serious disease in marine mammals, however,
will require larger conservation efforts to block these land pathogens
from flowing into our coastal waters."

During the 6-year study period, more than 5000 dead marine mammals
were reported on the coastal beaches of the Pacific Northwest, Dr
Grigg said. Some deaths ascribed to parasitic encephalitis (brain
swelling) were assumed to be caused by _T. gondii_, he noted, because
the parasite can infect most mammals and was well established in the
region.

To determine the cause of death of the marine animals, Dr Grigg
collaborated with veterinary pathologist Stephen Raverty, DVM, PhD, of
the British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture and Food and the
University of British Columbia, and marine mammal researchers Dyanna
Lambourn, of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, and
Jessica Huggins, of Cascadia Research Collective. Specimens were
collected and animal necropsies conducted by members of the Northwest
and British Columbia Marine Mammal Stranding Network.

Necropsies were performed on 151 marine mammals with suspected cases
of parasitic encephalitis. The mammals included several kinds of seals
and sea lions, Northern sea otters, a Pacific white-sided dolphin,
porpoises, and 3 species of whale. An additional 10 animals, all
healthy adult California sea lions that were euthanized in the
Columbia River to protect fish stocks, were included in the study as
controls. Dr Raverty's group examined brain tissue from 108 animals
positive for either _S. neurona_ or _T. gondii_. They measured the
number of parasites in the tissues and combined that with an
assessment of the degree of brain inflammation to gauge whether the
infection was likely to be the primary, contributing or incidental
cause of death.

At NIAID, Dr Grigg and his team screened 494 brain, heart, lymph
node, and other tissue samples with a variety of genetic techniques.
"Our techniques are unbiased in that we do not directly search for any
particular species of parasite," said Dr Grigg. "Rather, the screens
simply reveal evidence of any parasite in the tissue being studied."
The team then applied gene amplifying and gene sequencing methods to
identify the species and, often, the subtype or lineage of the
microbes.

They found parasites in 147 of the 161 animals studied-32 were
infected with _T. gondii_, 37 with _S. neurona _, and 62 with both
parasites. The remaining 16 infections were caused by various other
parasites, including several that had not been detected before in any
kind of animal. Notably, all 10 healthy animals were infected with
either one or both of the parasites.

"The presence of _T. gondii_ did not surprise us, but the abundance
of _S. neurona_ infections was quite unexpected," said Dr Grigg. The
researchers theorize that _S. neurona_ has been introduced into the
Pacific Northwest by opossums, which gradually have been expanding
their range northward from California and can shed an infectious form
of the parasite in their feces. The ample rainfall in the region
provides an easy route for infected feces to enter inland and coastal
waterways and then contaminate shellfish and other foods eaten by
marine mammals.

"The most remarkable finding of our study was the exacerbating role
that _S. neurona_ appears to play in causing more severe disease
symptoms in those animals that are also infected with _T. gondii_,"
said Dr Grigg. Among animals for which necropsy had suggested
parasitic infection as the primary cause of death, the co-infected
animals were more likely to display evidence of severe brain tissue
inflammation than those infected by either _S. neurona_ or _T. gondii_
alone. The 2 parasites are closely related, and other studies had
suggested that a mammal's acquired immunity after a 1st infection with
one parasite might protect it from severe illness following infection
by the other. However, that was clearly not the case in this study,
noted Dr Grigg. The study results also hinted that animals with
lowered immunity, such as pregnant or nursing females or very young
animals, were more likely to have worse symptoms when co-infected with
both _T. gondii_ and _S. neurona_.

"Identifying the threads that connect these parasites from wild and
domestic land animals to marine mammals helps us to see ways that
those threads might be cut," said Dr Grigg, "by, for example, managing
feral cat and opossum populations, reducing run-off from urban areas
near the coast, monitoring water quality and controlling erosion to
prevent parasites from entering the marine food chain."

NIAID conducts and supports research-at NIH, throughout the United
States, and worldwide-to study the causes of infectious and
immune-mediated diseases, and to develop better means of preventing,
diagnosing, and treating these illnesses. News releases, fact sheets,

[This seems to be a fascinating discovery. However, I wonder how long
these 2 parasites have been infecting marine mammals and how many
other possible parasitic synergies are in marine mammals that are
waiting for discovery. Would this explain the unusual beaching of some
of the animals? - Mod.TG]
