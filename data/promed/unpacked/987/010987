Santa Barbara County [California, USA] has seen cases of syphilis quadruple in recent years, and public health officials are trying to raise awareness about the disease.

Sexually transmitted diseases of all kinds are on the rise in the county, but syphilis saw the most dramatic increase from 2011 to 2013, rising from 5 cases to 22, and the rates for this year are on track to be just as high if not higher, said Dr. Lynn Fitzgibbons of the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department.

Syphilis rates on are the rise nationally as well as locally, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published data detailing a doubling of cases nationally between 2005 and 2012.

Though the overall number of local cases is still small, "this has everyone's attention, and is an increasing health problem," Fitzgibbons said.

As for why the increase is happening, "it's probably many things," she said, but one theory is that "as HIV is increasingly regarded as a chronic disease as opposed to a terminal illness, people are using condoms less than 20 years ago. As fear of HIV decreases, so does condom use." Another factor may be the proliferation of social media, which allows patients who are at higher risk to have increased access to multiple sexual partners, she said.

Locally, there has also been an increase in gonorrhea and chlamydia, but the rates of increase have been much less dramatic.

Fitzgibbon said the average patient seeking treatment for syphilis, locally and nationally, are mainly men who have sex with men and not specific to one age group or demographic.

[After reaching a historic low incidence rate in the United States in 2000, primary and secondary syphilis rates have since rebounded. These increases are occurring mainly among young men, and is associated in particular with men who have sex with men (MSM), as has been reported in many parts of the world (see previous ProMED-mail postings listed below). A recent MMWR publication from the CDC characterizes the increase in primary and secondary syphilis as a predominantly MSM epidemic (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6318a4.htm?s_cid=mm6318a4_w). In the 35 reporting areas in the US that reported the sex of sex partners for 70 percent or more of male cases, the proportion of male primary and secondary syphilis cases attributed to MSM increased from 77.0 percent (6366) in 2009 to 83.9 percent (8701) in 2012.

Reported increases in incidence of infectious syphilis among MSM have been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently, use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site. - Mod.ML
