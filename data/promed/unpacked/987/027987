We wish to report the 1st isolation of _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ in
Israel. On 31 Jul 2008, a 32-year-old man was seen in the Emergency
Room of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Hospital at Mount Scopus in
Jerusalem, complaining of 2 to 3 weeks of fatigue, chills, night
sweats and weight loss. The patient is a Thai agricultural worker
employed at a rural settlement in an arid region in the southern
Jordan Valley in Israel. He hails from a village in north-eastern
Thailand where he worked in rice and sugar-cane farming. He arrived
in Israel in November 2007.

The patient was found to be diabetic and anemic. He had normal kidney
function but deranged liver function tests, especially elevated
alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase levels. The
erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels were
markedly elevated. Urinalysis revealed leucocyturia and abundant
nitrites. Computed tomography demonstrated multiple abscesses in the
spleen and lungs, the superior pole of the right kidney and in the
prostate gland.

He had had 2 successive skin abscesses drained several months prior
to this admission, in the right axilla and at the right anterior
costal margin. Pus from these lesions was not cultured.

A blood culture (Bactec) taken on 2 Aug 2008 yielded growth of a Gram
negative bacillus. In view of the clinical presentation in a diabetic
male and the geographic history, the possibility was entertained that
the organism might be _Burkholderia pseudomallei_. This diagnosis was
confirmed after appropriate laboratory testing. The patient is being
treated with intravenous ceftazidime 2 grams 4 times daily and
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 2 160/800 mg tablets twice daily with a
slow response. Susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was
confirmed (1) by MIC carried out by Etest. The organism also grew
from a urine sample but not from material aspirated from a splenic abscess.

Recognition of the bacterium in the laboratory without delay was
facilitated by the clinical suspicion of the attending internists and
Infectious Diseases consultant. Molecular confirmation of the culture
identification is expected in the next several days.

_B. pseudomallei_ is regarded as an occupational hazard for clinical
microbiologists. While the risk of laboratory acquired infection is
not marked (2, 3), the nature of the disease demands special
precautions in dealing with its causative organism. Until recently
biosafety level 2 practices have been advised for clinical diagnostic
work (2, 4), but the recent tendency is to stricter safety practices
(3). Therefore, after risk assessment showed that 8 microbiologists
and an Infectious Diseases physician were exposed to the organism in
different degrees, 4 individuals who had manipulated the cultures
outside a biological safety cabinet were offered post exposure
chemoprophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (3).

The Israel Ministry of Health has been informed of this case. Many
thousands of Thai workers are legally employed in Israel (Israel
Central Bureau of Statistics Statistical Abstract of Israel 2007, Table 4.11;8
<http://www.cbs.gov.il/reader/shnatonenew_site.htm>), and hospitals
and HMOs in Israel should be aware of the possibility of melioidosis
in Thai workers with febrile illnesses, especially more chronic
clinical presentations as in our patient. Israeli clinical
microbiology laboratories should prepare themselves for the
likelihood of having to deal with _B. pseudomallei_ and should
include it in the workup of unusual non-fermentative colistin
resistant Gram negative bacilli, particularly in foreign contract
workers from Thailand or neighboring countries.

[Infection due to _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ (melioidosis) is
endemic in focal areas of South East Asia and northern Australia. In
Australia, it is also known as Nightcliff gardeners' disease
(Nightcliff is a northern suburb of the city of Darwin in the
Northern Territory of Australia. The Nightcliff area was the site of
RAAF camps with spotlights and large guns used to defend Darwin from
bombing during World War II. - Mod.LL). _B. pseudomallei_ is deemed
to be a category B biowarfare agent. It is primarily an infection of
humans with underlying diseases such as alcoholism, malnutrition,
cirrhosis, and immunosuppresion, but can also affect healthy
individuals, as in this report. In animal models, higher inocula can
cause more serious infection in immunocompetent individuals.

The manifestations of illness in these patients are not stated nor
whether the individuals had underlying risk factors. Clinically,
infection due to _B. pseudomallei_ may be subclinical, but rapidly
progressive disseminated disease involving the skin, liver, or spleen
can occur. Pneumonia may be the presenting form, either acute or
chronic. The latter may present years after exposure, when the
individual is no longer in an endemic area and may look very much
like pulmonary tuberculosis. The diagnosis can be confirmed
microbiologically and/or serologically.

The disease was first described in Rangoon, Burma (now Myanmar), by
Whitmore and Krishnaswami in 1912 among homeless, debilitated
morphine addicts. Autopsies performed on the remains of these
individuals revealed a process reminiscent of glanders, an
abscess-forming infection of horses and, quite rarely now, man.
Microbiologically, the physicians from Her Majesty's Indian Health
Service could distinguish the isolated organism from the glanders
bacterium and others. The term melioidosis as related by White (1)
was coined by Fletcher and Stanton from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, from
the Greek words melis (a distemper of asses) and eidos (resemblance).
Cases were subsequently described with isolation of the organism from
clinical specimens and soil from many countries primarily in eastern Asia.

The infection was recognized in both Allied and Japanese soldiers
during the Second World War and subsequently was recognized in
Northern Australia. Later, during the Vietnamese war of independence
with France and, more so, the United States involvement, there were
many more cases described. Because of the infection's potential to
produce potentially life-threatening reactivations several decades
after exposure, the term "Vietnam time bomb" was used. It is likely
that many of the acute and fatal cases in troops remained undiagnosed.

Also a disease of animals, melioidosis is not truly a zoonosis, since
it is not transmitted from animals to man but rather both acquire the
infection from its soil reservoir. It may cause infection in many
species and has become a significant veterinary pathogen in
zoological gardens. As pointed out by White (1), the infamous
L'affaire du Jardin des Plantes was said to have occurred after a
panda donated in 1973 by Mao Tse-Tung to the French president
Pompidou was the index case of melioidosis that significantly
affected several French zoos as well as race and equestrian horses.

The disease is endemic in South East Asia and as noted above more
recently in Northern Australia, but cases have been described in the
western hemisphere without travel histories as well. There are some
_B. pseudomallei_-like organisms that are much less virulent.
Formerly considered to be a separate biotype, these L-arabinoside
assimilators are now classified as _B. thailandensis_ and account for
about a quarter of soil isolates in Thailand. _B. pseudomallei_ is a
hard-core survivalist organism that can persist in triple-distilled
water for long periods of time.
