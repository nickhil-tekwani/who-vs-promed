The state Secretariat of Agriculture and Food Supply (SEAB) is concerned about the rabies outbreak which has hit Parana this year [2012]. Up to the present, in 2012, SEAB technicians have registered 41 foci of the disease and 47 deaths. The outbreak has hit principally rural properties of cities in the interior of the state.

The official responsible for the rabies sector in Parana, Elzira Pierre, requests that producers inform technicians when they identify the 1st symptoms of the disease in their animals. For the time being, Londrina is free of the outbreak.

Rabies [virus] is transmitted by bats that feed on animal blood. Last year [2011], more than 120 cases of the disease were registered in Parana.

[This is a continuation of the current bovine rabies outbreak in Parana state 1st reported on 19 Jan 2012 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120123.1018767). Apparently, Parana state is endemic for vampire bat transmitted rabies virus. Although the animals involved above are not identified, they are most likely to be bovines. However, vampire bats do feed on equine animals and occasionally on other mammals including people. Livestock owners would be well advised to vaccinate their animals.

The bats involved in the outbreak are most likely the vampire, _Desmodus rotundus_. The above report makes no mention of vampire bat control. These bats are very susceptible to poisoning with warfarin and related compounds. If these compounds are applied externally as a jelly to the bats, when they return to their day-time roosts, mutual grooming will expose the roosting colony to the pesticide.
