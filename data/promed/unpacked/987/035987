[The location of the solitary outbreak in pigeons on a backyard holding in East of the Czech Republic is shown in the Report's interactive map at the source URL.

Newcastle disease (ND)is caused by virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) of the genus Avulavirus belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae. There are 10 serotypes of avian paramyxoviruses designated APMV-I to APMV-10.

ND virus (NDV) has been shown to be able to infect over 200 species of birds, but the severity of disease produced varies with both host and strain of virus. Even APMV-1 strains of low virulence may induce severe respiratory disease when exacerbated by the presence of other organisms or by adverse environmental conditions. The preferred method of diagnosis is virus isolation and subsequent characterisation.

The above and additional information on ND is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.14_NEWCASTLE_DIS.pdf. - Mod.AS]
