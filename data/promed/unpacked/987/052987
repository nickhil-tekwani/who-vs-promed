Little cherry disease (LChD) occurs in most cherry growing areas in the
world. Infection of sensitive cultivars results in small fruit with poor
color, angular shape, and insipid flavor. 3 closterovirus species associated
with LChD have been described: (i) Little cherry virus-1 (LChV-1) from
Germany (4); (ii) LChV-2 from USA (2); and (iii) LChV-3 from British
Columbia [BC, Canada] (1).
Despite similarities in symptom development in orchard trees and woody
indexing, the 3 viruses have distinct molecular sequences (3). LChV-2 and -3
share greater homology with each other than either does with LChV-1. For
many years, the BC Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in
conjunction with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Pacific Agri-Food
Research Centre has monitored the incidence and spread of LChD in the
Okanagan and Kootenay valleys of BC.
For years, testing for LChD was by indexing on woody indicator trees,
_Prunus avium_ cv. Lambert (fruit symptoms) and cvs. Canindex1 and Sam (foli
ar symptoms). Recently, LChD incidence has been evaluated by DAS-ELISA (3),
and RT-PCR based on sequence data from LChV-3 (1). During the 1999 survey,
orchard trees with typical LChD symptoms and trees that formerly tested
positive by woody indexing were negative for LChV-3 by RT-PCR and ELISA.
293 trees were subsequently tested for LChV-1 by RT-PCR using the primer set
LCV3EC/LCV16659 (4). A 276-bp fragment corresponding to the extreme 3'
untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the LChV-1 genome was amplified by RT-PCR
from 140 of the trees. The RT-PCR amplicon from 1 sample (#99-68B from
Peachland) was sequenced and, using a BLASTn search, LCHV-1 was identified
as the most probable match ( E value 4e -59). Sequence alignment using
ClustalX identified 2 regions of high sequence homology: bases 2 to 70 (92
percent) and bases 99 to 239 (95 percent). The intervening region displayed
much lower homology (61 percent). The overall homology of the amplicon was
88 percent compared to the corresponding region in LChV-1.
Divergence between the published sequence of LChV-1 and the sequence of the
new LChV (tentatively LChV-4) was investigated. 7 sets of primers
constructed on the basis of sequence data from various regions of the LChV-1
genome (2 sets from each of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, heat shock 70
protein homologue, and coat protein) failed to yield RT-PCR products when
tested with the LChV-4 isolate.
LChV-4 is clearly related to LChV-1 within the 3'-UTR, but complete
sequencing is required to determine the overall relationship with other
viruses causing LChD. The discovery of a new isolate of LChD in BC may
require a reevaluation of the epidemiology of LChD and its management.

[LChD was first observed in 1933 in eastern British Columbia, but little
progress was made on the characterization of the causal virus. The only
known vector of the virus was subsequently shown in 1986 to be the apple
mealybug (_Phenacoccus aceris_), and it is likely that the virus originated
in infected ornamental flowering cherry, which is a common ornamental tree
in BC. If unchecked, LChD invariably spreads, producing unmarketable fruit
of poor flavor. In Germany, outbreaks of LChD have occurred at 2 widely
separated locations, but the mealybug vector is rarely detected. Moreover,
there has been no spread of LChD from infected cherry trees to neighboring
healthy trees in more than 10 years, suggesting that another mealybug or
other insects may be involved in spread of the virus in Europe.
The genomic diversity of the isolates in this study suggests that
recombination between different closteroviruses could be operative in the
origin of new isolates. In BC, disease management involves compulsory
eradication and destruction of infected trees and the deployment of mealybug
control programs.
