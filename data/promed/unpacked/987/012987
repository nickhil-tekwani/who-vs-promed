The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has attributed the delay by states in acknowledging outbreak of cholera as the leading cause of high fatality rate in 2021. The number of cases reported nationally in 2021 was 111 062 with 3604 deaths, exceeding the number reported in 2020.

The Incident Manager, NCDC, Dr. Sebastian Yennan, said this at the ongoing Cholera Preparedness, Prevention and Response Training for Stakeholders in Abuja. He said that history had shown that states never loved to be associated with cholera, a general belief that it was a disease of the poor, which brought about restrictions. Yennan said: "They believe it is a disease of the poor, it is a disease that brings out regulations and so many other things. So many of our states are not doing much as it relates to Water, Sanitation and Hygiene in our states."

"When an outbreak of cholera comes, it is very difficult for states to acknowledge. Therefore, we are happy it triggered the awareness and consciousness in the whole system and the fact that we had two governors who acknowledged that they had cholera in their states was a beautiful thing for us."

A UNICEF Consultant, John Adams, said it was imperative for all states to have their own cholera response plan as an advocacy tool for political actors to make budgetary provisions for cholera available. Adams noted that cholera reached the African continent in 1971 with more cases as a result of consumption of contaminated water sources. He said water safety plans must be adhered to with safety from point of collection to point of consumption, adding that safely-managed sanitation should be practiced to avoid open defecation.
