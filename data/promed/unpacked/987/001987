Three more suspect cases of yellow fever (YF) have been detected in Sao
Paulo State: one in the capital (Sao Paulo), the others in Ribeirao Preto &
Orlandia. One was a 36-year-old doctor who was in Ilheus, Bahia State, &
Alto Paraiso, Goias State, at the end of the year. All 3 cases were
probably contracted outside Sao Paulo State. Laboratory results are due
today.
A previous suspect case, in Campinas, was in a man who spent New Year's
Eve in Chapada dos Veadeiros, Goias State [as did a confirmed, non-fatal
case in Rio, see ref. above - Mod.JW.
In 1999 there was only one case of YF registered in Sao Paulo State, also
"imported" from elsewhere in Brazil.
"If the sick people were bitten by the mosquito Aedes aegypti, it could
spread the virus in the city," said Luiz Claudio Ferreira Espindola,
director of the Center for Epidemiology, Research & Information. But the
Superintendent of the Department of Endemic Control, Luiz Jacinto
[moderator of ProMED-PORT, our Portuguese/Spanish language list - Mod.JW,
said there is no immediate risk. "More people are being exposed because
they are doing ecotourism or going to places which were not [usually
visited. But we are far from having an outbreak in the city."
The incidence of YF has increased significatly in Brazil, from 3 cases, all
fatal, in 1997, to 34 cases (15 deaths) in 1998 to 70 cases (25 deaths) in
1999.

[The original of this post, in Portuguese, appears in today's ProMED-PORT,
whose moderator, Luiz Jacintho da Silva (quoted above) appended these
comments (translated):
"At the beginning of the 1950s the last epidemic of yellow fever in Sao
Paulo State occurred in the west of the State. It was sylvan (of forest
origin), not urban. The last case of urban YF (Aedes aegypti transmitted)
in Brazil was in Sena Madureira, Acre State [formerly Territory in 1942."
"The end of the year, particularly the one just past, is a time of large
population movements. Chapada dos Veadeiros, Goias State, is besides being
naturally beautiful a mystic place that attracts a large number of persons
of different beliefs. One fundamental belief that everyone should have is
in the efficacy of vaccination -- the rest is up to the individual."
"According to the Epidemiological Surveillance Center of the Sao Paulo
State Secretariat of Health, the number of clinically suspect cases of YF
is rising enormously, which is to be expected once doctors are alerted to
the diagnosis, but many cases will probably be dengue. - LJS."
This would nevertheless be a good time to mass vaccinate the cities of Sao
Paulo & Rio against YF as a protective measure. - Mod.JW
