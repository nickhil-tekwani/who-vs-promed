included despite the original date of 13 Jun 2006. I was unable to
cut and paste from a pdf file on my hand held computer so had to put
this on the back burner till this week, when I finally have access to
a proper computer. - Mod.JAD]

Winter wheat harvest has started from southeastern Virginia to
southern Kansas. Some of the spring planted small grain crop in
northern states is behind normal growth stage.

Wheat stem rust
--------------
In late May 2006, severe wheat stem rust developed on late-planted
nurseries at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In late May 2006, traces of stem
rust were observed on late-maturing lines of wheat at Kinston, North
Carolina.

Wheat leaf rust
-------------
Wheat leaf rust is generally light in many northern wheat growing
areas except where moisture conditions are good.

In early June 2006, traces of leaf rust were found on the spring
wheat Alsen in Bottineau County in north central North Dakota, which
is near the Canadian border. In early June 2006, in central and
eastern Nebraska and in irrigated wheat in southwestern Nebraska,
leaf rust developed to severity levels of up to 15 to 25 percent on
flag leaves. Drier than normal conditions have slowed leaf rust
development in most areas of the central and northern plains.

In early June 2006, wheat leaf rust was found in fields from east
central Missouri to southern Illinois at 20 percent severity on flag
leaves. Yield losses will be light in this area because the crop is
at the soft dough stage.

In early June 2006, trace levels of leaf rust were found on flag
leaves of wheat in fields from northwestern Ohio to south central
Wisconsin. In plots in west central and northwestern Indiana, 40
percent severitiy was found on lower leaves. With continued good
weather for rust infection, rust may become severe on susceptible
cultivars in this area.

In early June 2006, leaf rust that over wintered was limited to the
lower canopy of wheat in Pennsylvania. In North Carolina, wheat leaf
rust was widespread in the central Coastal Plain and particularly
severe in the Neuse River basin; only traces of wheat leaf rust were
observed in the Piedmont and coastal counties.

Leaf rust was earlier and more severe than normal across the state of
Virginia. There appeared to be little virulence to the Lr9 gene in
the rust population, as Tribute, Coker 9835 and Coker 9663 were
virtually clean. In contrast, there seems to be significant virulence
to genes Lr24 and Lr26 and, to a lesser extent, virulence to Lr18.

Wheat stripe rust
----------------
Wheat stripe rust is present in only trace amounts in most northern
wheat growing areas.

In early June 2006, traces of stripe rust were found in a winter
wheat nursery in east central Nebraska at Mead. This was the 1st time
stripe rust was observed in Nebraska this year [2006]. In early June
2006, traces of stripe rust were found in winter wheat plots in
northeast South Dakota. This year, stripe rust is very light in the
central and northern plains because the inoculum from the southern
plains was light and hot, drought-like weather conditions persist in
much of the area, which is not conducive for rust development.

In early June 2006, traces of stripe rust were found in east central
Missouri fields. In early June 2006, 40 percent wheat stripe rust
severities were observed on flag leaves in plots in northwestern
Indiana; trace severities were found in fields.

As of 9 Jun 2006, no stripe rust has been reported in Pennsylvania.
This year [2006], insignificant levels of wheat stripe rust were
present throughout the Coastal Plain of North Carolina.

In early June 2006, light stripe rust was found on Garland wheat
under irrigation in Logan, Utah. Stripe rust was not found in the
dryland area in northwestern Utah. This is typical, since rust is
rarely seen in Utah. Last year [2005] was an anomaly with quite
severe stripe rust in Logan, which started much earlier in the
growing season. Prior to last year [2005], the previous year that had
significant stripe rust (or any rust) was 1993 (which was similar in
temperature and moisture to 2005).

In late May 2006, wheat stripe rust was severe throughout the Central
Valley of California, especially in fields where fungicides were not
applied. Statewide yield loss to wheat stripe rust may approach 15
percent this season.

In late May 2006, wheat stripe rust was starting to increase on
susceptible winter wheat entries in nurseries in the Palouse region
of Eastern Washington. Severities ranged from one to 10 percent, with
less than one percent of the plants infected. The stripe rust
appeared one month later that last year [2005] in the Palouse region.

[There are 3 main rust diseases of the cereal crop plant wheat (bread
wheat, _Triticum aestivum_ and durum wheat, _Triticum turgidum_), all
caused by species of the fungus _Puccinia_: wheat stem rust (_P.
graminis f.sp. tritici_), wheat leaf rust (_P. triticina_ aka _P.
recondita f. sp. tritici_) and wheat stripe rust (_P. striiformis f.
sp. tritici_).

Severe losses due to wheat stem rusts have abated in the USA since
the 1960s due to effective resistance breeding. Severe losses are
still a possibility with leaf rust. The USDA Cereal Disease
Laboratory in St. Paul, Minnesota publishes regular reports on cereal
rusts in the USA during the crop season. Each report gives detailed
state-by-state information, including a summary map, all in pdf file
format (see link to main article). Information for rusts other than
those that infect wheat is not included in this ProMED-mail posting,
but others are described in the full report.

In this report, a generally light level of all 3 rust types is
summarized for early June 2006.
