Over 6000 ducks die of blood poisoning in Myanmar
-------------------------------------------------
A total of 6700 ducks in a village in Myanmar have died of blood
poisoning, the local Myanmar Times reported in its latest issue.
The death of these ducks at Katoke-Phayagi village in Daik-U township
of Bago division late in January 2005 was due mainly to failure to
vaccinate the birds against septicemia, the Livestock Breeding and
Veterinary Department was quoted as saying.
However, the disease stopped spreading after nearly 6000 other ducks
were vaccinated in a 5-kilometer radius around the affected area,
livestock officials said, adding that 5000 more ducks in the area are
planned to receive the same treatment.
Meanwhile, the department has stepped up an educational campaign
targeting chicken farms as part of its precaution against possible
outbreak of bird flu during the cool season.
The authorities confirmed that Myanmar continued to remain free of
bird flu, saying that the country has little potential to be
affected, partly because chickens were kept in a condition not as
crowded as in other countries.
Since the outbreak of bird-flu was reported in neighboring countries
in January 2004, Myanmar has checked about 8.5 million chickens at
nearly 8000 poultry farms across the country as part of its measures
to prevent the possible outbreak of bird-flu.
There are 63 million chickens in Myanmar, of which 50 million are
bred outdoor in rural areas, official statistics show

[The term septicaemia is generally used to describe Avian
pasteurellosis or 'Fowl cholera", an infectious disease caused by
_Pasteurella multocida_. This is a rather wide-spread avian disease
that can affect all types of birds and is often fatal. Fowl cholera
was included in the previous List B diseases of the OIE, recently
amalgamated with List A to become a single list.
In its peracute form, fowl cholera may clinically resemble highly
pathogenic avian influenza and velogenic, viscerotropic Newcastle
disease.
The bacterium usually responds to antibiotics and sulfonamides;
commercial vaccines with moderate efficacy are available. The
presence of the disease has been reported by Myanmar to the OIE in
each of the recent annual reports (2002 -- 46 outbreaks; 2003 - 52
outbreaks).
It would be helpful to be informed whether the laboratory diagnostic
measures adopted for the identification of the disease in affected
farms have ruled out viral involvement, such as Duck viral enteritis,
Duck viral hepatitis, and especially avian influenza. - Mod.AS]
