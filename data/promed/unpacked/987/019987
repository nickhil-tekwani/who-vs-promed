China suffers Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
A deadly outbreak in eastern China of a common childhood illness that
rarely kills people has caught the attention of international health
officials. The outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) has
killed 20 children in Fuyang, a city in eastern Anhui province, and
has affected some 1200 children altogether, according to the Anhui
provincial health department. Of those cases, 341 children are still
in the hospital. A report by the state-run Xinhua news agency late
Sunday [27 Apr 2008] evening said the outbreak began in early March
and cited the city's health department as confirming that the disease
was caused by enterovirus-71, one of several viruses that can cause HFMD.

The disease is common among children and infants, who can develop a
fever, rash and sores in the mouth once infected. But the disease --
completely unrelated to foot-and-mouth disease, which affects cattle,
pigs, and sheep -- rarely kills people. Most HFMD patients recover
within a week or so. Clusters of fatal cases occasionally emerge and
were reported in Malaysia in 1997 and Taiwan in 1998, according to
the Web site of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.

Even though the family of viruses that caused the Chinese outbreak is
found around the world, and the particular strain involved has been
reported in China in recent years, "we believe the situation is still
of concern, especially because of the current high reported case
fatality rate compared to previous years," Cris Tunon, an official
with the World Health Organization in Beijing, said in a statement.

China's Health Minister Chen Zhu visited Fuyang on Saturday [26 Apr
2008], according to the Xinhua report. Chinese health officials at
the local level in the past have sometimes played down disease
outbreaks early on, only to be caught off guard later. After families
[arrived at] hospitals with their sick children, rumors began
circulating in Fuyang.

"Because there is no information about the strange disease from the
officials, rumors from the street are becoming unrestrained,"
according to a story in the Democracy and Law Times, a Beijing-based
newspaper. "Some people are calling this disease 'Baby SARS.'"

Feng Lizhong, deputy director of Anhui Provincial Health Department,
said that when the outbreak started in March [2008], it was unclear
what the disease was, so they reported the cases to higher-level
health officials. Eventually, health officials arrived in Fuyang and
investigated for about 10 days, Mr. Feng says, and sent virus samples
to Beijing for analysis.

Ever since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or
SARS, swept across China and eventually claimed nearly 800 lives
world-wide in 2002 and 2003, international health officials have long
feared that slow reporting about a disease outbreak on the Chinese
mainland could thwart any effort to respond and contain the outbreak.

Hong Kong's Center for Health Protection issued a news release on 24
Apr 2008 detailing a single case of a 7-year-old boy from the
mainland who was diagnosed with HFMD 3 days after he was admitted to
a Hong Kong hospital.
