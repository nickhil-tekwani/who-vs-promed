On August 31, 1998, two suspected cases of fungal pneumonia were reported
to the Boulder County (Colorado) Health Department (BCHD). Both patients
were immunocompetent, healthy adults working for the City of Boulder Open
Space program on a prairie dog relocation project. The findings indicate
these two persons acquired blastomycosis in Colorado, which is outside the
area of endemic disease.
Patient 1 was admitted to a hospital with a 12-day history of fever, weight
loss, fatigue, arthralgias, and productive cough. Patient 2 had the same
symptoms and additionally had skin lesions (punctate lesions on arms and
trunk and lesions resembling erythema nodosum on legs) and chest pain. Both
patients had been on an extended course of 2 antibiotics.
A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated bilateral pulmonary diffuse
nodular opacities. A subsequent open lung biopsy revealed small budding
yeasts. After 10 days (patient 1) and 21 days (patient 2) of culture,
_Blastomyces dermatitidis_ was identified and confirmed by DNA probe
(GenProbe, California), both at the local hospital laboratory and at
Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The patients were treated with
intravenous (IV) amphotericin B for 10 and 14 days respectively, followed
by a prescribed 6-month course of oral itraconazole for both.
The two ill persons had worked together on the prairie dog relocation
project on August 3 and 10 (14 and 7 days before onset of illness for
patient 1). Work practices at the site included using a gasoline-powered
auger and hand trowels to excavate abandoned prairie dog tunnels and
burrows that were being used by many other animal species.
The workers did not use personal protective clothing or face masks. The two
ill persons performed vigorous digging, created large amounts of dust, and
spent 6-7 hours each day with their faces close to the dirt. It rained on
13 of the 15 days during July 22-August 5; Boulder received 4.4 inches of
rain during this period (normal rainfall for July and August combined is
3.3 inches).
All 15 workers were interviewed for symptoms of disease, and chest
radiographs were offered to all workers. Only the two ill persons had chest
abnormalities; both previously had lived in disease endemic areas and where
they could have been exposed to _B. dermatitidis_, but neither reported a
history of such illness. Blood from 14 workers (including the two ill
workers) was submitted for serologic testing; results are pending. CDC
collected composite soil samples from burrows at the site for microbiologic
analyses; results are pending.
MMWR Editorial Note: Blastomycosis is caused by inhalation of spores from
_B. dermatitidis_, a dimorphic fungus found in soil and rotting wood.
Blastomycosis most commonly presents as a subacute pulmonary disease, but
can range from asymptomatic infection to disseminated disease involving the
skin, bones, and genitourinary system. In the United States, disease
occurs sporadically throughout the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys and
the southeastern states. In states where blastomycosis is reportable (e.g.,
Wisconsin and Mississippi), the annual incidence of disease is 1.3-1.4 per
100,000 population; in areas where it is endemic, smaller areas of
hyperendemicity can have rates of up to 41.9 cases per 100,000 persons.
In areas where blastomycosis is endemic, dogs infected with _B.
dermatitidis_ can signal increased risk for human infection. Few cases of
blastomycosis have been reported among humans or animals in Colorado.
Although both patients previously resided in areas where they could have
been exposed to _B. dermatitidis_, it is unlikely they would have
concurrent reactivation of previously acquired disease. [An excellent
reasons for communication between veterinarians and physicians. - Mod.TG]
There are two contributing factors in this case. First, _B. dermatitidis_
is more common in soils with high nitrogen and organic content, possibly
provided by the stored food and fecal matter of the animals living in the
burrows. Second, the above-average rainfall before the excavations and the
humidity may aid reproduction of the organism.
Blastomycosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of illness
in patients with subacute lobar or segmental pneumonia, particularly when
it is refractory to initial antibiotic therapy and the patient has a
history of outdoor occupational or recreational exposures.
Serologic testing may assist in diagnosis, but complement fixation and
immunodiffusion lack sensitivity and the WI-1 antigen-based antibody test
has good sensitivity and specificity but is not widely available. Skin
testing is not available for blastomycosis.
Treatment of this disease includes ketoconazole or itraconazole for mild or
moderate disease and intravenous amphotericin B for patients who are
severely immunocompromised, have central nervous system involvement, or are
severely ill.
The risk for exposure to blastomycosis remains small even in areas where
the disease is endemic, and few public health recommendations have been
developed for prevention of blastomycosis.
Measures recommended for protecting workers against other endemic mycoses
(e.g., histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis) probably will be protective
against exposures to soil contaminated by _B. dermatitidis_. These measures
include 1) use of a CDC-approved N-95 disposable half-facepiece filtering
respirator (or equivalent), protective clothing and shoe covers by all
persons engaged in soil-disturbing activities during prairie dog
relocation, 2) employer-provided instruction of all persons with potential
to be engaged in these activities in the proper fitting and wearing of the
recommended face mask, 3) implementation of a respiratory-protection
program for employees, and 4) education of workers about clinical signs and
symptoms of disease and screening and treatment options. Interim
recommendations for workers engaged in prairie dog relocation have been
developed by BCHD and will be modified as needed based on the serology and
soil-testing results.
