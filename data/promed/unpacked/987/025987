Warning: Georgia -- Biological Hazard
-------------------------------------
Two herdsmen in the country of Georgia have been infected with a brand-new virus, scientists from the [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday [1 May 2014]. The newly identified virus is a 2nd cousin to smallpox. And, like smallpox [virus], it causes painful blisters on the hands and arms. Other symptoms include fever, swollen lymph nodes and overall weakness, the CDC scientists [stated] at a meeting in Atlanta. "We consider this family of viruses very important because smallpox could be used as a bioterrorism agent," said disease detective Neil Vora, who led the team that made the discovery. The virus doesn't yet have a name, Vora says, because so little is known about it. "We haven't found any evidence of human-to-human transmission so far," according to Vora. "But how many people are getting sick? Are animals getting sick? We don't know. [Nor] do we know if it has caused any deaths." Both of the 2 men who caught the virus have fully recovered. But related [poxviruses] can be deadly for people with suppressed immune systems. And [there was] a fatality rate of about 30 percent before the illness [smallpox] was eradicated in 1980. Since then widespread vaccination against smallpox [has ceased]. This immunization gap seems to be opening the door for other viruses in the [poxvirus] family. "When you vaccinate a person with [any] of these viruses, it protects [against] other viruses in the family," Vora stated. "Since smallpox vaccinations stopped, there's some indication that other [viruses in the orthopoxvirus genus] have started to increase in incidence because there's less immunity." Four other viruses in that family [_Poxviridae_] infect people: cowpox, monkeypox, vaccinia and smallpox. All but smallpox generally infect animals -- cows, cats or monkeys -- then jump to people opportunistically. Both of the infected Georgian men caught the new virus from dairy cattle. At 1st, local health workers thought one man had anthrax -- anthrax infections of the skin are [common?] in rural parts of the country [Georgia].

But when tests came back negative, the Public Health Department contacted the CDC for help. Vora and his team quickly figured out they were dealing with a poxvirus. But it turned out to be one that had never been seen before. "The discovery brings up the question of what other viruses might be circulating out there that are even more closely related to smallpox and cowpox," Vora said. Although smallpox was eliminated in the wild, stores of the virus still exist in a few American and Russian laboratories. And there's growing concern that [they] could be used for [biological warfare?]. Last year the US government spent about USD 460 million on a relatively new smallpox medicine [vaccine?], in case the virus was deliberately released in a bioterrorism attack. There was a sufficient [amount] to treat about 2 million people.

CDC reports 3 human cases caused by new orthopoxvirus
-----------------------------------------------------
Scientists with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have detected a new orthopoxvirus -- the family of viruses that includes smallpox and cowpox -- in 3 people in the nation of Georgia, including 2 herdsmen, the CDC reported in a news release yesterday [30 Apr 2014].

The finding was announced this week at the CDC's 63rd Annual Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) Conference, which highlights the work of CDC's EIS officers, or "disease detectives."

When the 2 herdsmen, neither of whom was vaccinated against smallpox, became ill after contact with sick cattle last summer [2013], the CDC investigators determined through extensive testing that they were infected with a previously unknown orthopoxvirus.

The CDC team then interviewed 55 people who had contact with the herdsmen or with cattle. They found that, of 9 interviewees born after routine smallpox vaccination had stopped in 1980 because of eradication of the disease, 5 had orthopoxvirus antibodies. They also discovered an additional case in a different region of Georgia in a person who was originally suspected of having anthrax in 2010.

The new virus causes painful blisters on the hands and arms, as well as fever, swollen lymph nodes, and weakness, according to a story today [1 May 2014] from NPR. The patients survived their infections, the CDC said.

The CDC researchers also found evidence that some of the herdsmen's cows had previously been exposed to orthopoxviruses and that viruses also circulated among rodents in the area, the agency said.

The researchers concluded that, "Orthopoxviruses are anticipated to emerge in the absence of routine smallpox vaccination and should be considered in persons who experience cutaneous lesions after animal contact."

Experts argue smallpox virus stocks should be kept for now
----------------------------------------------------------
US and Brazilian experts today [1 May 2014] make the case for postponing destruction of the last known live strains of variolavirus, the virus that causes smallpox, because crucial scientific questions remain unanswered and important public health goals have not been met, according to their commentary in the journal PLoS Pathogens.

The issue of smallpox virus destruction will be on the agenda when the World Health Assembly, the governing body of the World Health Organization, meets later this month [May 2014].

The experts, Inger K. Damon, MD, PhD, of the CDC, Clarissa R. Damaso, PhD, of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, and Grant McFadden, PhD, of the University of Florida, summarized the research achievements on live variolavirus over the past several decades, including several new smallpox vaccines and 2 new drug candidates.

"While certain aspects of the original research goals using live virus have been met, other key items, like the wider approval of accurate diagnostics that can distinguish smallpox from other orthopoxvirus diseases or the full licensure of new antiviral drugs and vaccines that are effective against variola virus, have not yet been completed," the experts write.

They say that "greater exploitation of current technologies may lead to additional therapeutic or diagnostic products to better respond to any future emergency situation resulting from a smallpox appearance."

[Human smallpox caused by variola virus (VARV) presented a threat for humans worldwide for centuries. The successful eradication of smallpox was possible thanks to comprehensive vaccination programmes and quarantine measures under the auspices of the WHO in the 1970s. The last natural smallpox infection was described in Somalia in 1977 [1]. One year later, 2 VARV infections occurred in Great Britain which probably originated from a virus laboratory [2, 3]. In late 1979, the WHO finally declared smallpox to be eradicated and the use of smallpox vaccine has been forbidden since the late 1980s; therefore there are few people in the global population, other than the military and laboratory workers, who are still vaccinated. A consequence of this may be that a lack of immunity in the population may facilitate the reappearance and expansion of a vaccinia-like virus. Consequently, surveillance of novel orthopoxviruses remains a priority.

The orthopoxviruses comprise one of 8 genera forming the subfamily _Chordopoxvirinae_; the others are _Parapoxvirus_, _Capripoxvirus_, _Leporipoxvirus_, _Suipoxvirus_, _Molluscipoxvirus_, _Yabapoxvirus_, and _Avipoxvirus_. The names are deceptive and do not always reflect host specificity; e.g. monkeypoxvirus being transmitted predominately by rodents, as revealed in the ProMED-mail reference list below. Nonetheless, a resurgent smallpox-like virus would most likely originate from an orthopoxvirus. The analysis by the US CDC of the novel poxvirus responsible for the moderately severe disease affecting patients in Georgia does not appear to be resurgent smallpox virus, but it is clearly prudent to maintain surveillance. - Mod.CP
