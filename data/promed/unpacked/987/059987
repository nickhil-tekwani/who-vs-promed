A 6-year-old leukemia patient died and 2 patients were made ill in an
outbreak of a rare fungal infection at a Hong Kong hospital, a
spokesman said. The boy died in November 2008, while another boy,
aged 11, contracted the infection in January 2009, and a 38-year-old
man was found with it on Wednesday [11 Feb 2009], the hospital
spokesman said in a statement.

Both the 11-year-old and the man are in a stable condition and
receiving treatment, according to the statement released late
Wednesday [11 Feb 2009]. All 3 were leukemia patients in Queen Mary
Hospital's bone marrow transplant unit, which has now been closed for
a week [A different report stated that the adult was 48 years old and
had died. - Mod.LL].

The hospital said the 3 had contracted gastrointestinal mucormycosis,
a rare intestinal infection spread through fungi spores. "I have been
a microbiologist for 27 years, and this is the 1st time I have seen 3
cases of intestinal mucormycosis in such a short time," said Yuen
Kwok, a microbiology consultant at the hospital, according to the
South China Morning Post newspaper.

The 2 surviving patients had eaten pre-packaged food, thought to be a
possible source of the outbreak, according to the paper. The hospital
said it is investigating whether other patients, including a
57-year-old man who died, had contracted the infection.

[There is some controversy over the terminology used to refer to
infections due to these fungi. The older, more common term
mucormycosis is familiar to most clinicians and will be used here.
However, many mycologists prefer zygomycosis, since other members of
this class can cause infection besides those in the _Mucorales_ order.

These are a class of fungi that can cause a variety of infections in
humans, particularly in immunocompromised patients and those with
ketotic diabetes mellitus. Infection can cause devastating
rhino-orbital-cerebral and pulmonary infection with an extremely poor
prognosis, characteristically with the fungus invading arteries
causing tissue infarction. Gastrointestinal involvement is less common.

The fungi are ubiquitous, found on decaying vegetation and in the
soil. They grow rapidly and release large numbers of spores that can
become airborne. Because of their ubiquity in the environment, they
are relatively frequent contaminants in the clinical microbiology
laboratory, and people have ample exposure to the fungi spores during
day-to-day activities. The fact that zygomycosis is a rare human
infection reflects the effectiveness of the intact human immune
system. The genera most commonly found in human infections are
_Rhizopus_, _Mucor_, and _Cunninghamella_.

Because these cases involved the gastrointestinal tract, it is
reasonable to postulate that a specific food source was involved,
especially if the isolates were the same genus. A classical
nosocomial outbreak of mucormycosis occurred in non-immunocompromised
hosts related to contaminated elasticized adhesive dressings causing
primary cutaneous disease (Mead JH, Lupton GP, Dillavou CL, Odom RB:
Cutaneous Rhizopus infection. Occurrence as a post-operative
complication association with an elasticized adhesive dressing. JAMA
1979;242: 272-274). - Mod.LL]
