Lab tests indicate that an outbreak of salmonellosis that has sickened 46 children likely came from food served by a lunch caterer that primarily serves schools, according to the city’s health department.

Samples of frozen ground beef and raw chicken taken from a kitchen belonging to a Lunch Lady franchise on Boyd Avenue tested positive for the same bacterium detected in the children and 4 adults who’ve been sick enough to seek medical attention in the last 2 weeks, the department said in a Friday evening, 23 Mar 2012, statement.

"The results further point to a link between the outbreak and the ground beef prepared at the caterer, but additional testing is still underway," the statement said.

The beef was tainted with _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium and the chicken with _S. enterica_ serotype Heidelberg, it said, 2 of the many types of the bacterium. The department’s investigation has pointed particularly to Lunch Lady meat lasagna and beef tacos as foods eaten by people who later got sick.

The bacterium can be rendered harmless if food is cooked to a high enough temperature.

The challenge now is to determine whether the meat was contaminated when it arrived at the kitchen or became tainted while Lunch Lady workers handled it. The health department "is in communication with the Provincial and Federal Health and Food Safety authorities to assist in the ongoing investigation and response," the statement said.

50 people (46 children and four adults) became sick in cases believed to be connected to this outbreak, which the department revealed at the beginning of last week. Known cases have been found in about a dozen elementary schools, a Kanata daycare, and at Merivale High School. In the high school case, an older sibling likely caught the bug from a younger one. To prevent more secondary infections, the health department urges Ottawans to be careful about hygiene, especially when preparing food.

The health department also added 3 more schools to the list of institutions where related cases have been identified:

Featherston Drive Public School in Alta Vista, First Avenue Public School in the Glebe, and Holy Redeemer School in Kanata.

[It is now established that cultures of some of the food resulted in the growth of salmonellae. To this point, it has not been stated what serotype or serotypes were isolated from those affected. Additionally, genetic analysis is needed to show the relatedness of the isolates. - Mod. LL
