A report into the dramatic decline of woylies [see photo link below]
throughout south-western Australia has found a mysterious disease may
be decimating the species. Speaking today [15 Feb 2008] at Murdoch
University, Environment Minister David Templeman said although the
exact disease remained a mystery, researchers had identified some key
suspects, including the parasite 'Toxoplasma' and a new species of
parasite 'Trypanosoma sp. nov.'

"It is likely this disease is either killing the woylies or weakening
them and making them more vulnerable to predators," Mr. Templeman said.

The Minister said the dramatic decline in woylie numbers since 2001
meant the small kangaroo-like mammal was again in need of special protection.

"As a result, the woylie has been re-listed on Western Australia's
updated threatened species list to ensure it is given maximum
protection and the best opportunity to again thrive," he said. "The
effects of threatened listing include higher statutory protection,
higher penalties for the illegal removal of species of up to AUD 10
000 [USD 9 070], and higher priority for research, recovery planning
and management. Threatened listing also leads to increased focus
during environmental impact assessment, land-use planning and
assessment of vegetation clearing applications."

Mr. Templeman said the woylie had been de-listed in 1996, as it no
longer met the criteria to be listed as 'threatened' following a
population recovery thanks to fox control and translocation programs
undertaken in the South-West by the Department of Environment and
Conservation.

"In 2001, the woylie population reached a peak of around 40 000
individuals," he said. "But there has been an estimated 70 to 80
percent decline in woylie numbers since that time, which is tragic."

The Minister said the Carpenter Government had allocated AUD 626 000
[USD 567 800] to a major research program into the woylie.

"The program, headed by the Department of Environment
and Conservation's Dr. Adrian Wayne, involved key collaborating
agencies including Murdoch University, Perth Zoo and the
non-government organisation, the Australian Wildlife Conservancy,"
Mr. Templeman said.

"There has also been representation from the South Australian
Department of Environment and Heritage, The University of Western
Australia and the University of Adelaide."

The Minister said all the collaborators, as well as the South-West
Catchments Council, had been generous with their time and expertise.

"More than 85 experts and 120 volunteers have been working long and
hard to help the woylie," he said. "The collaborations are the
greatest strength of the research project and provide us with the
greatest prospects to solving what is a very complex mystery. Today's
symposium and tomorrow's workshop will be crucial in focusing on how
we can act now for future and to protect WA's unique biodiversity and
do our very best to ensure the survival of the woylie."

Extracted from the above Web site:
"The Woylies or Brush-tailed Bettong is one of the rat-kangaroos weighing
around 1.3 kg. The name "woylie" has been adopted from the indigenous
Nyoongar (south west Australia) name. It has powerfully clawed
forefeet used for digging, is yellowish grey above and paler below.
The tail has a distinctive black crest.

"The name 'woylie' is an aboriginal name meaning "stick carrier" as
they can carry leaves and sticks in their prehensile tail, which they
use to build elaborate dome nests under bushes, especially
grasstrees. They are nocturnal and spend the day in their nest.
Research into woylies in Western Australia has shown that the animals
do not consume green plant material, nor drink free water. They are
thought to mainly eat the fruiting bodies of underground fungi, and
some bulbs, tubers, seeds, insects and resin. Woylies can turn over
incredible amounts of soil (several tonnes in a year), playing an
important ecological role in burying leaf litter and recycling
valuable nutrients as well as reducing fire risk. The diggings also
allow water penetration as they break up the soil including the
surface oils and spread the fungal spores and seeds that are a major
component of woylie diet."

And quoting from my moderator colleague AS, "Outbreaks of
toxoplasmosis in wild and captive marsupials, with high mortality,
have been described in scientific literature for several decades.
Affected animals may exhibit diarrhea, respiratory compromise,
lethargy, weight loss, blindness, or neurological deficits. The
susceptibility of Tammar wallabies (_Macropus eugenii_) has been
demonstrated experimentally: 13 animals were dosed orally with 500,
1000, or 10 000 oocysts of _Toxoplasma gondii_, as part of a
vaccination trial; 11 animals died of acute toxoplasmosis 9 to 15 days
after challenge. The lesions were similar in all animals, consisting
of foci of necrosis and inflammation in the intestines, lymphoid
tissue, adrenal cortex, heart, skeletal muscle and brain, and severe
generalised pulmonary congestion and edema. See Reddacliff et al.
(1993): Pathology of experimentally-induced, acute toxoplasmosis in
macropods; Aust Vet J. 70(1):4-6." - Mods.AS/TG

No evidence is given in this report to support the finding of a new
species of trypanosome. A reliable source informs ProMED that in the
areas where the woylie has declined, domestic cats are found, whereas
in other areas there are no cats. Cats are well-known reservoirs of
toxoplasmosis. - Mod.JW]
