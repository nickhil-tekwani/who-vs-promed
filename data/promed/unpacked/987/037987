Brown County health officials say shelled peas sold at 3 farmers' markets in the state caused an outbreak of salmonellosis.

Officials say there are 7 confirmed cases in the state, across 4 counties. Four of those cases are in Brown County, and one person was hospitalized.

During a news conference on Fri 11 Aug 2017, Brown County health officials say the cases were 1st reported last week. The shelled peas were sold at farmers' markets in Green Bay, Madison and Fond du Lac on Sat 22 Jul 2017:

- Dane County Farmers Market in Madison located on the capital square (Saturdays) or Martin Luther King Blvd (Wednesdays)
- Downtown Green Bay Farmers Market (Saturdays) located in downtown Green Bay.
- Fond du Lac Farmers Market (Saturdays) located in downtown Fond du Lac

At this time, health officials are not releasing the name of the vendor or vendors involved. Anyone who purchased shelled peas from the listed farmers' markets between 19 Jul 2017 to 5 Aug 2017 are asked to throw them away, even if they have been frozen. The advisory does not include peas that were bought inside the pod or shell.

Brown County health officials are assuring consumers the contaminated peas are gone and the peas that will be sold at Saturday's Farmers Market are safe.

Health officials are stressing the importance of washing any fresh vegetable or fruit before consuming.

[Clearly, the peas became contaminated during shelling since the unshelled product was not part of the warning. The contaminated lots are no longer available, but the peas may have been frozen by some consumers. - Mod.LL
