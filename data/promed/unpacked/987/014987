Stripe rust alert for southern Alberta wheat
--------------------------------------------
Stripe rust is a significant disease of both wheat and barley
worldwide. In Alberta, since 2003 the incidence and severity has
increased dramatically in some years. The fungus can over-winter in
Alberta. However, the greatest risk is from air-borne spores from
wheat in the US.

Infections were first observed in the Lethbridge winter wheat
nurseries on 30 Jun 2009 and conditions have favoured secondary
infection. Infections were noted in the spring wheat nurseries on 3
Jul 2009. The rainfall on 13 Jul 2009, in southern Alberta favours
continued sporulation and secondary infection.

Upon landing on a suitable wheat plant, the spores produce fungal
strands, which grow beneath the leaf surface and emerge within 10
days as a stripe on the leaf. If ideal conditions persist, released
spores re-infect other portions of the plant and ultimately the
entire crop and [other] crops both near and far. The rainfall in
Lethbridge combined with cool days and cold nights have allowed the
disease to progress with a number of repeating cycles since 30 Jun
[2009].

There are a number of spring and winter wheat varieties that offer
very good resistance to stripe rust. Rust may still occur on these
varieties but they should not require protection with a fungicide.
For some varieties, the stripe rust reaction is not known. Radiant,
the most commonly grown winter wheat in the Lethbridge region, has
adequate stripe resistance whereas the number 2 variety, Bellatrix,
is very susceptible. A number of effective fungicides are available.

[Stripe rust, also called yellow rust, of cereals is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow
leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100
per cent. It affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a
number of wild grasses. Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles
during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may
generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum for the next crop cycle.
Disease management includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide
applications, and control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence have been reported
in recent years from Europe, North America, Australia, India, and are
also suspected to emerge in China. New strains may also be involved
in the increase of disease severity in recent years reported above
for Alberta. Disease monitoring is important to recognise new
pathogen strains, and continuous resistance breeding is required to
keep ahead of pathogen adaption.
