A Louisiana sausage company is recalling 500 000 pounds of Cajun meat
mixture following an incident when 62 people became sick with salmonella
from eating the food at a wedding reception, the U.S. Agriculture Department
said Tuesday. Nine of the guests had to be admitted to the hospital for
fever and diarrhea after the Aug 15 wedding in Louisiana, the department
said.
Savoie's Sausage and Food Products, Inc., of Opelousas, La., is asking
customers to return its "Real Cajun! Savoie's Dressing Mix" that was
distributed in nine states: Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana,
Michigan, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. The mix is a cooked product of
ground pork and chicken in gravy that consumers usually prepare with rice to
make "dirty rice" or is served with corn bread. The USDA asked the company
to recall the product after the department learned that test results from
the sickened wedding guests tested positive for _Salmonella_.
"USDA is informing the public so consumers who may have purchased and
stored this product can check their freezers," Thomas Billy, head of
the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, said.
Savoie General Manager Freddie Lafleur said the family-owned company
discovered that a pump used to process the Cajun mixture had a defective
piece that carried the harmful bacteria. "Now that that has been corrected,
we shouldn't have any more problems," Lafleur said. Consumers should return
all of the dressing mix found in one-pound, uncoded packages as well as
coded products with a four-digit number stamped on the side of the container
with the first three numbers ranging from "195" to "258" with an eight as
the last digit. "Est. 13346" appears inside the USDA inspection seal on the
product labels.
