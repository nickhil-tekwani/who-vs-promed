[1] FAO revised FMD alert statement in Asia

[ProMED-mail post "Foot & mouth disease - Asia: FAO, alert", archived
20110127.0328, derived from the UN News Centre
(http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37398&Cr=livestock&Cr1=)
and circulated on Thu 27 Jan 2011, included the following fragment:

"According to the agency, foot-and-mouth disease spread through China
in recent years and entered eastern regions of Russia and Mongolia for
the first time. The disease recently affected an estimated 1.5 million
Mongolian gazelles, whose migration may have helped carry the virus
into China. FAO sent an emergency response team to Mongolia to help
authorities cope with the disease".

The above information, picked up by news agencies, seems to have
caused some misunderstanding regarding the alleged spread of FMD into
China and underwent revision; a revised FAO statement has been
published, with a changed text of the said fragment as follows:

"In recent years new strains of FMD virus have spread throughout China
and eastern regions of Russia and Mongolia. FMD recently affected
large numbers of Mongolian gazelles, among a total population
estimated between 2 and 5.5 million. FAO sent an emergency response
team to Mongolia to help authorities cope with the disease".

Foot-and-Mouth Disease in South Korea signals regional risk
-----------------------------------------------------------
FAO is calling for veterinary and border control authorities in Asia
to be on alert for animals showing signs of infection by
Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), following an unprecedented outbreak of
the livestock-affecting sickness in South Korea.

Since late November 2010, South Korean authorities have imposed
quarantines, initiated a vaccination campaign that is targeting 9
million pigs and 3 million heads of cattle, and culled 2.2 million
livestock. The overall cost of this effort is estimated at around USD
1.6 billion.

"The current FMD dynamics in eastern Asia, as well as the magnitude of
the outbreak in South Korea, are unlike anything that we've seen for
at least a half century," said Juan Lubroth, FAO's Chief Veterinary
Officer. "This makes preparedness and monitoring extremely important
right now."

"Authorities in Asia should make sure they are in a position to detect
any instances of the disease and respond rapidly in an appropriate
way. FAO is advocating proactive vaccination campaigns designed to
stop the spread of the disease," he said. "FMD must be tackled as a
regional problem, which is why FAO through its Regional Office for
Asia and the Pacific is planning to organize a meeting of chief
veterinary officers of East Asian countries to discuss the current
situation and possible coordinated responses," added Subhash Morzaria,
Asia Region Manager of FAO's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal
Disease Operations.

Lubroth also noted that when responding to outbreaks, countries should
adhere to accepted practices that adequately take animal welfare and
environmental impacts into account.

Media reports of an FMD outbreak in North Korea have not been
confirmed by authorities there.

In recent years new strains of FMD virus have spread throughout China
and eastern regions of Russia and Mongolia. FMD recently affected
large numbers of Mongolian gazelles, among a total population
estimated between 2 and 5.5 million. FAO sent an emergency response
team to Mongolia to help authorities cope with the disease.

The overall situation in Asia is cause for concern, said Lubroth,
especially given the approaching Lunar New Year holiday, during which
large numbers of people will be on the move in the region, many of
them carrying meat products and some transporting animals.

FMD is a highly contagious disease affecting cattle, buffaloes, sheep,
goats, swine and other cloven-hoofed animals. It causes blisters on
the nose, mouth and hooves and can kill young or weak animals. There
are several types of FMD viruses. The type causing the outbreak in
South Korea is Type O. The disease does not pose a direct health
threat to humans, but affected animals become too weak to be used to
plough the soil or reap harvests, and farmers cannot sell the milk
they produce due to infection by the virus.

One of the early signs of the disease in infected animals is the
excessive production of saliva and nasal discharges. The FMD virus may
survive for several hours outside the infected animal, especially in
cold and humid environments. This means it can be transported on
almost any object that has been in contact with contaminated saliva or
other discharges.

The cost of cleaning farms and culling animals is a burden for
farmers, and trade restrictions based on disease outbreaks can have
major impacts on both local and national economies. Costs resulting
from an FMD outbreak in the U.K. in 2001 have been estimated at 13
billion euro [USD 17 693 413 638].

With FMD introductions on the increase, the question arises whether
large scale culling should remain the preferred method of dealing with
FMD occurrences, or if vaccination should play a much more important
role.

"Emergency vaccination with the aim to disrupt disease transmission
and assist progressive elimination is increasingly applied,
particularly during the peak of an epidemic, so as to buy time during
culling operations. Vaccination can also be applied to protect animals
and keep them alive and productive," said Lubroth. "Today we have
tests that can distinguish between animals that were infected and
animals that were vaccinated, making it easier for countries to
re-obtain certification of FMD-freedom after recovering from an
outbreak," he said.

[To the list of early signs of FMD mentioned in the statement, one
should add the occurrence of sudden deaths (with typical cardiac
changes) in offspring of susceptible animals, predominantly lambs,
kids and piglets. - Mod.AS]

Asia
-----
1. Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Turkey
--------------------------------------
The O-PanAsia-2 and A-Iran-05 lineages continue to dominate in these
countries. The PanAsia-2 lineage has been subdivided into 6
sub-lineages named BAL-09, YAZ-09, FAR-09, SAN-09, ANT-10 and PUN-10.
During 2010, the ANT-10 sub-lineage appeared to have become the
dominant type O sub-lineage in Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Turkey.

2. P.R. China
-------------
A single outbreak of FMDV type O occurred in cattle on 04 Oct 2010 at
Lage village, Dengqen, Qamdo, Tibet, bringing the total number of
outbreaks to 18. No information concerning the genotyping of virus
from this outbreak is yet available.

3. Mongolia
-----------
Three VP1 sequences were received from FGI-ARRIAH on 16 Nov 2010.
Analysis of these sequences showed them to be closely related to
sequences determined from viruses previously isolated at the WRLFMD;
i.e.; FMDV O SEA topotype, Mya-98 lineage (see commentary below).

4. Myanmar
----------
On 10 Sep 2010, a single outbreak of FMD was detected in cattle at Kun
Thee Pin, Maungdaw, Maungdaw, Rakhine State very close to the border
with Bangladesh. It was typed as FMDV A, the 1st occurrence of this
serotype in Myanmar since 1978. A VP1 sequence was generated from cDNA
amplified from RNA submitted by the Thailand Regional Reference
Laboratory (Pakchong), but no virus was isolated in cell culture.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus was not related to type
A viruses from Southeast Asia but was most closely related to viruses
occurring in India in 2000. The sequence clustered with viruses
occurring exclusively in India between 1997 and 2008.

5. Republic of Korea (South Korea)
----------------------------------
Since late November 2010, South Korea has experienced over 100
outbreaks of FMD type O. Analysis of 4 VP1 sequences received from the
National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service (NVRQS) has shown
that these are viruses of the SEA topotype, Mya-98 lineage, similar to
those previously isolated earlier in 2010 (see commentary below).

6. Taiwan POC
-------------
As the result of a routine serological survey using an NSP ELISA, 10
pigs in a herd of 161, at South District, T'ai-Nan Shih (17 Dec 2010)
were found to be positive for FMDV antibodies. The pigs were all
clinically healthy and attempts at virus isolation and RT-PCR were all
unsuccessful.

[The quarterly report includes also table C "Vaccine matching for type
O FMDV by VNT and LPBE - WRL FMD," showing data pertaining to 11
vaccine strains (O K77/78, O IND R2/75, O PanAsia 2, O TAI 189/87, O
TAW 98, O TNN 24/84, O 4174, O 3039, O 4625, O BFS, and O Manisa).
These were matched against 25 isolates from 11 countries: Ethiopia (2
isolates), Iran (7), Kenya (2), Mongolia (3), Myanmar (2), Nigeria
(1), Pakistan (2), Thailand (2), Tanzania (1), Turkey (2) and Zambia
(1 isolate). The Mongolian isolates showed no antigenic match with the
vaccine strain O Manisa.

The South Korean, HK or Japanese isolates are not included in the
table. However, these strains are known to be similar to the strain
circulating in Mongolia, namely "topotype SEA, Mya-98 lineage."

Details on the FMD vaccine strains applied during 2010 in Japan,
Mongolia and China, as well as currently in South Korea, and
observations on their efficacy in cattle and pigs, will be helpful.

The sequencing results of the recent South Korean isolates, including
a dendogram and a map, are to be found on page 15. - Mod.AS]
