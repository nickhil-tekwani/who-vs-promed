Over 12 000 people in Lampung [province, Indonesia] have reportedly
contracted the mosquito-borne chikungunya disease [virus] since mid
December [2009], the highest recorded number in the last 10 years,
says the provincial Health Agency.

Although the disease is not deadly, many victims have been forced to
stay in bed for a week due to joint pains they said made them feel
like they were paralyzed. "I had to drop my New Year celebration
plans thanks to the illness," said a man, 46, of West Tanjungkarang,
Bandarlampung, on Wednesday [29 Dec 2009]. He said that he and his
children had gone to a local community health center (Puskesmas
[auxiliary health centers]) to seek medical treatment, but were still
yet to recover from the disease. Most of the chikungunya sufferers in
the province are being treated at home or at the nearest Puskesmas.

So far, Tulangbawang and Mesuji have been reported as the worst hit
regencies in the province, where the disease has affected between
3000 and 4000 people in both regions consecutively. Mesuji is a
former transmigration area and the majority of its population comes
from Java and Bali, where numerous swamps are left abandoned. "None
of the sufferers in Mesuji are receiving medical treatment at
hospital. Most of them don't consider the disease deadly although it
tortures them with pain and decreases their ability to work," said
the head of the regency health agency, Anindito. He added that most
of the sufferers had complained of joint and bone pains. Yet, he
assured the disease would not paralyze them. "They will recover by
themselves in 5-7 days," Anindito said.

Meanwhile in West Lampung, the regency health agency reported that
930 people were suffering from chikungunya [virus disease], most of
whom lived near or inside the forest. They are spread across 10
subdistricts in the Bengkunat-Belimbing district, with Penyandingan
the worst hit subdistrict.

The chikungunya virus is contracted through the bite of the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito. Once infected, victims develop a high fever,
reddish spots, joint pains, vomiting, flu symptoms, and headaches.
Some call the disease the bone flu in reference to its specific
symptoms.

Head of the Lampung Health Agency Reliyani said her office was
inventing [estimating?] the number of sufferers across the province
and would use the data to help rid the province of the disease.
"Fogging is not the best answer to dealing with the disease. A
healthy lifestyle and 3M plus practices [drain, bury, cover to
eliminate _Aedes_ mosquito breeding sites for these vectors of the
virus - Mod.TY] are a better alternative," said Reliyani, referring
to the abbreviated term of periodically cleaning water containers as
a preventive measure.

[Chikungunya cases were reported in south Sumatra in April 2009.
Apparently, this is a new and significant outbreak on that part of
Sumatra, perhaps imported from elsewhere.
