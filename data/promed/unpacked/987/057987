The Monterey County Health Department is advising people to avoid
consuming raw or undercooked oysters (such as those that are lightly
steamed, marinated, or prepared as Rockefeller). The reported
illnesses are associated with the naturally occurring bacterium
_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, which is most prevalent during summer
months when water temperatures are most favorable for its growth. The
majority of illnesses that occur from the consumption of raw oysters
are not life-threatening to the general population, said the health
department.

The symptoms are watery diarrhea, often with abdominal cramping,
nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills. According to the Health
Department, usually these symptoms occur within 12 to 24 hours of
ingestion of raw oysters and last no more than 7 days. While the
Health Department strongly discourages the public from consuming raw
and undercooked oysters at this time, if consumers choose to consume
oysters, they should ensure the oysters are cooked thoroughly as
follows.

In the shell:
- Discard oysters with shells already opened.
- Boil oysters until the shells open. Once open boil for an additional
3-5 minutes.
- Steamer: add oysters to steaming water and cook live oysters until
the shells open. Once open, steam for another 4-9 minutes.
- Discard any oysters that do not open during cooking.

Shucked oysters:
- Boil or simmer shucked oysters for at least 3 minutes or until the
edges curl.
- Fry at 375 deg F [191 deg C] for at least 3 minutes.
- Broil 3 inches [8 cm] from heat for 3 minutes.
- Bake at 450 deg F [232 deg C] for 10 minutes.

[It is important to stress that _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is naturally
present in marine waters and does not imply sewage contamination, as
would be the case with _Salmonella_ sp. or _E. coli_. It is most
common in warmer waters such as those of the American Gulf Coast, but
warmer waters in more northern climates such as in Washington State
and Alaska, can also be associated with oyster-associated _V.
parahaemolyticus_.

The number of cases that have occurred is not stated in the news
release above. - Mod.LL]
