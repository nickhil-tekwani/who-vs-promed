[The reported cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria have been increasing recently. The reason for the higher than usual number of fatal cases is undetermined. One possibility is an increase in the populations of the Lassa fever virus reservoir host, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp), with an increase in numbers of virus carriers due to more favorable environmental conditions for them. This could result in more contamination of the environment with virus-containing excreta from these rodents.

Prevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depends on control of the rodent reservoir, which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection.

Lassa virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and can cause acute hemorrhagic fever in humans.
