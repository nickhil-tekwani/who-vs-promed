[1] Tunisia: Disease outbreak news - update
Date: Thu 9 May 2019

https://www.who.int/csr/don/09-may-2019-measles-tunisia/en/


From 1 Jan 2019 through 30 Apr 2019, the Ministry of Health in Tunisia responded to a large measles outbreak in the country. A total of 3141 suspected cases, of which 909 (28.9%) were laboratory-confirmed and 1236 (39.4%) epidemiologically linked cases, including 30 deaths (case fatality ratio, 1.0%), have been reported in all of the 24 governorates (range, 1-1274). The majority of cases were reported from Kasserine (1274 cases) and Sfax (212 cases) governorates. In April 2019, 4 additional governorates were particularly affected with 155, 116, 93, and 69 cases reported from Kairouan, Tunis, Sousse, and Nabeul, respectively.

The 2 most affected age groups were those older than 15 years (31%) and infants between the age of 6 and 12 months (28%). The male/female ratio was 1.2. Of affected children between 1 and 5 years of age, 84% were not vaccinated. Death was reported in 30 cases, ranging in age from 15 days to 41 years (median, 7.5 months).

To date, the number of reported measles cases is above the average annual number (12 cases) registered in the past 10 years in the country, with the highest number (48 cases) reported in 2012.

In 2013, Tunisia changed its immunization strategy and introduced the 1st dose of measles-containing vaccine at the age of 12 months instead of 9 months.

[2] Chad
Date: Wed 8 May 2019
Source: Reliefweb [report from Medecins Sans Frontieres; edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/chad/measles-epidemic-declared-may-2018-still-not-under-control


Parts of Chad, including the capital, N'Djamena, and the city of Am Timan, are in the throes of a measles outbreak that has lasted for a year and is rising in intensity.

"Chad has a pattern of measles outbreaks, which usually start in spring and die out when the rains start in June," says Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) emergency coordinator Theresa Berthold. "However, 2018's measles outbreak is still continuing. The epidemic is still not under control."

Officially declared in Chad in May 2018, the measles outbreak has affected 69 of the country's 126 districts.

In January [2019], the outbreak increased in intensity, with 9000 measles cases and 68 deaths reported in the 1st 3 months of 2019. This is a huge increase on the previous year [2018], with 5336 measles cases and 96 deaths reported by the Ministry of Health from May to December 2018.

MSF's emergency response unit in Chad arrived in the city of Am Timan in January [2019], when this new peak was declared. Over 4 weeks, 150 MSF staff vaccinated 107 000 children in Am Timan city and 13 other locations in Am Timan district.

The emergency team is also helping to manage measles patients in Am Timan hospital and 3 health centres, which provide free medical care. MSF teams in Am Timan cared for 1677 children with complicated measles in the 1st 3 months of 2019.

In the days leading up to the mass vaccination campaign, MSF's team in Am Timan visited local communities -- including the area's nomadic population -- to share information about protecting their children from measles.

"We had a number of nomad fathers coming from several kilometres away to get their children vaccinated after hearing about the campaign from our team," says Berthold. "One of them took us later to his community so we could vaccinate all of the other children there."

In the capital, N'Djamena, MSF has turned its former inpatient nutrition centre, set up in July 2018, into a measles unit to provide inpatient care for affected children. MSF's support to other health facilities managing measles patients has increased: so far, some 1500 patients have been treated in 21 MSF-supported health centres. Working with 270 community health workers, [MSF is] also supporting active case-finding to find children with measles and refer them for medical care.

MSF's mass vaccination campaign in Am Timam is not the only one to have taken place in Chad over the past year, but the current national response to control the outbreak appears to be insufficient.

To achieve "herd immunity," 95% of children need to be vaccinated. Chad is far from achieving this, with just over 1 in 3 children under the age of 5 years (37%) vaccinated against measles, and just 1 in 4 fully immunised against common childhood diseases, according to the latest data shared by Chadian health authorities.

"A concerted effort by the Ministry of Health and international organisations is needed to halt the epidemic," says Martin Braaksma, MSF's head of mission in Chad. "Without a national mass vaccination campaign for all children in Chad under the age of 5, the health of the hundreds of thousands of malnourished children expected during the seasonal hunger gap starting in June or July will be jeopardised. A country-wide free measles treatment system should also be established."

Malnutrition and measles are a killer combination, as measles can worsen malnutrition, while the low immunity caused by malnutrition can make measles much more severe, increasing the risk of death.

Abstract: Malnourished children experience more severe measles infections at a greater frequency than well-nourished children. In Africa, the mortality rate for measles infection is 25%-50% in infants and young children with edematous malnutrition. There is some evidence that the altered immune responses of malnourished people permit widespread viral infection. A recent study by Whittle et al. investigated the immune response of malnourished children to measles in order to define the cellular basis of severe viral infection in nutritional deficiency. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from well-nourished and malnourished Nigerian children were compared. Significantly more virus was found in the cultures of cells from malnourished children as opposed to well-nourished controls, with a negative correlation between virus yield and log serum albumin level. The production of interferon from the mononuclear cells of the 2 groups did not differ significantly, leaving unexplained the increased yield of virus by cells of malnourished children. The more extensive viral invasion of tissues and widespread inflammation and cell death in malnourished children infected with measles may contribute to the generation of more complexes and consequent immunosuppression, in turn resulting in secondary infections.

WHO recommends that vitamin A supplements improve child survival. Vitamin A supplements have been shown to reduce the number of deaths from measles by 50% in populations with vitamin A deficiency. For children who are vitamin A deficient or undernourished, it would seem a simple solution -- immunization against measles and better nutrition -- to save lives.

However, many of the world's most vulnerable children suffer from poor nutrition, including being vitamin A deficient, which increases their risk of death from measles, and can decrease the effectiveness of the vaccine. They live far from health centers and health infrastructures. They are at risk of missing, or being missed by, immunization and vitamin A supplementation campaigns.

There were 43 measles cases in the 1st 4 months of this year [2019], nearly 3 times the number seen during the same period last year [2018], said health minister Gan Kim Yong yesterday [Tue 7 May 2019]. All were sporadic or had a limited spread, and there was no community outbreak, said Mr Gan.

He added the cases were a result of more measles outbreaks around the world, and Singapore, as a travel hub, is more exposed to imported cases. Speaking in Parliament, Mr Gan said patients in 33 of the 43 cases had not been vaccinated against the disease. Nine of those not vaccinated were infants under a year old who were not yet due for vaccination, while the rest were a mix of children and adults.

The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is generally given in 2 doses: the 1st dose when a baby turns a year old and the 2nd when the child is between 15 and 18 months old. Vaccination is mandatory for local children and foreign children applying for long-term Singapore passes. The Health Ministry's figures show 95% of children receive the 1st dose by age 2, with 93% receiving the 2nd dose by age 7.

Mr Gan said most parents were "waiting for the next convenient occasion to bring their children for vaccination, and unfortunately, sometimes that occasion never came."

Currently, the Health Promotion Board sends reminders to parents whose children have not completed their vaccinations by age 2.

Auckland now has the highest number of measles cases in the country, with 42 confirmed cases. Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) announced 2 new cases on Tuesday [7 May 2019]. A further 40 people were in quarantine.

The news comes after the 1st case of measles was confirmed in the Wellington region.

ARPHS has not released any further information, including the ages or genders of the patients, or where they were from in Auckland.

Last week [week of Mon 29 Apr 2019] the service said Auckland was experiencing an "outbreak" of the virus.

A total of 24 Aucklanders have been hospitalised for measles so far this year [2019], an ARPHS spokesperson told Stuff.

Figures from ESR, the agency that tracks notifiable diseases on behalf of the Ministry of Health, show there have been 111 cases of measles in New Zealand so far this year [2019].

[5] Switzerland: 2 deaths
Date: Fri 3 May 2019
Source: Swiss Info [abridged, edited]
https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/latest-figures_measles-cause-two-deaths-in-switzerland/44938108


Switzerland has seen 2 deaths due to measles this year [2019], the Federal Office of Public Health says, and the number of reported cases is on the rise. The 1st death involved a 30-year old man who had not been immunised, and who was infected by relatives. He received the vaccination 67 hours after exposure, but it was too late: he came down with the infection and died at home, shortly after showing the 1st symptoms, the health office said on [Thu 2 May 2019]. The exact cause of death in being investigated.

The 2nd death was of a 70-year-old man who had a compromised immune system due to cancer. He died a few days after infection due to pneumonia caused by measles. It is not yet known how he got the disease.

The health office said that since the beginning of the year there have been 155 registered cases of measles in Switzerland. Detailed data for January to mid-April [2019] show 138 cases, a more than 7-fold increase compared to the same period in 2018 (19 cases). A sharp rise was already reported at the beginning of April. The health office said the situation was "fragile" and that measles could only be eliminated if 95% of children and adults born after 1963 were vaccinated with two doses of the jab.

Larger outbreaks in the Swiss cantons of Neuchâtel and Bern have shown that extra measures to stop the disease from spreading are needed, the office continued. This included identifying contact persons and stopping children who are not immunised from attending daycare and schools. Passengers who have been travelling in the same plane as someone with measles must also be informed of this, and about measures to take.

Despite pockets of vaccine resistance that has led to a surge in measles cases in the United States, a new poll found that 87% of Americans believe the measles virus is dangerous and 87% believe the vaccine against it is safe.

The poll, conducted by Ipsos on behalf of Thompson Reuters, also found that a similar number (85%) believe that children should be vaccinated against measles unless there are medical reasons for avoiding it. It also found that 77% think children should be vaccinated against the disease even if parents object to vaccinations, with support a little stronger among Democrats (81%) than Republicans (74%). When asked if they have been vaccinated against measles, 71% said they had, 7% said they hadn't, and 15% didn't know.

The online poll, which included 2008 US adults, was conducted from 30 Apr-2 May[2019], according to an Ipsos press release. It included 785 Democrats, 666 Republicans, and 378 Independents. It has an overall credibility interval of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.

In an update yesterday on measles activity in the Western Pacific region, the World Health Organization (WHO) noted a resurgence in all of its regions but spotlighted an unusually high number of cases in several Western Pacific countries in which measles had been eliminated. The surge in infections is caused by recent imported cases, the WHO said.

In the Philippines, cases this year [2019] have increased 378% compared with the same period in 2018. Australia is reporting higher numbers of cases this year [2019] compared with the same period over the last 4 years, and Japan is reporting its largest epidemic in a decade. Malaysia in 2018 experienced an exponential rise -- nearly 900% -- in measles cases compared with 2013 levels.

Hong Kong reported an airport-linked cluster of 29 cases, and 32 infections in Macao this year [2019] include 10 cases in staff from 2 hospitals. Of 150 cases in South Korea reported since 17 Dec 2018, 8 clusters were linked to imported infections.

[7] Kennedy family at odds over vaccination
Date: Wed 8 May 2019

https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/05/08/rfk-family-splits-publicly-over-vaccine-controversy/AIdo4pMKvaPxrB4EcH7eBP/story.html


In a rare public dispute, 2 of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s siblings and a niece are challenging his antivaccine stance in the wake of a measles outbreak they say is claiming more than 110 000 lives worldwide each year.

In an op-ed posted to the Politico website, former Massachusetts congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, and Townsend's oldest daughter, Maeve Kennedy McKean, who runs Georgetown University's Global Health Initiative, express love for their relative, but sharp disagreement on the value of vaccines.

"We love Bobby. He is one of the great champions of the environment. . . . We stand behind him in his ongoing fight to protect our environment,'' the Kennedy relatives wrote in their joint op-ed. "However, on vaccines he is wrong."

The anti-vaxxer movement, the op-ed said, is fueled by "internet doomsayers," whose opposition to the use of vaccines are playing a negative role in the current outbreak in the United States linked to unvaccinated people, many of whom are children.

"Robert F. Kennedy Jr . . . has helped to spread dangerous misinformation over social media and is complicit in sowing distrust of the science behind vaccines,'' the op-ed said. "His and others' work against vaccines is having heartbreaking consequences."

"We are proud of the history of our family as advocates of public health and promoters of immunization campaigns to bring life-saving vaccines to the poorest and most remote corners of America and the world, where children are the least likely to receive their full course of vaccinations,'' the op-ed said. "On this issue, Bobby is an outlier."

The pro-vaccine Kennedys said parents are right to carefully consider vaccination for their children but said the overwhelming medical evidence from decades of use shows vaccines are effective and safe, aside from some mild side effects.

"Those who delay or refuse vaccinations, or encourage others to do so, put themselves and others, especially children, at risk," the op-ed said. "Everyone must communicate the benefits and safety of vaccines and advocate for the respect and confidence of the institutions that make them possible. To do otherwise risks even further erosion of one of public health's greatest achievements."

[8] Germany: vaccination law
Date: Tue 7 May 2019
Source: Fortune [abridged, edited]
http://fortune.com/2019/05/09/measles-vaccine-mandatory-fine-kindergarten/


Germany may adopt the strictest stance on measles vaccines in Western Europe, and certainly one that goes beyond current requirements in most of the United States.

On [Sun 5 May 2019], German health minister Jens Spahn proposed a new law that would see parents fined up to EUR 2500 (USD 2800) for failing to vaccinate their children against measles. Unvaccinated kids would also be banned from attending kindergartens because they might come in contact with babies who are still too young to receive their 1st measles shot.

Germany's move follows the same debate that's still raging across the world: whether vaccines should be a choice or a rule.

In parts of Western Europe -- where the "anti-vaxxer" movement has been growing recently despite being based on bogus science -- falling immunization rates have prompted politicians to take action. (Under a concept called "herd immunity," vaccination rates of at least 95% are seen as essential to stopping the spread of the disease through populations.)

In France, where only 90% of kids get even their 1st measles vaccine -- uptake rates for the 2nd shot are typically lower -- a recent law forbids unvaccinated children from attending nurseries or schools, though it does not involve any fines. In Italy, where measles vaccination rates are below 80%, a new law also bans unvaccinated kids from attending school and hits parents with a fine if they send their children to school regardless.

Fears over measles outbreaks are not theoretical. In France, there were 54 cases in December [2018], 125 in January [2019], and 188 in February [2019], a 248% increase in 2 months. In Italy, the numbers jumped from 76 cases in December [2018] to 172 cases in January [2019], though they fell slightly to 160 new cases in February [2019].

The figures in Germany, where there is a 1st-shot vaccination rate of 93%, suggest a worrying resurgence of the disease, with 164 cases already in just the 1st 2 months of this year [2019]. That trend has been enough to spur the German government's new proposals, which is broadly supported and likely to be in place within a year.

Unlike in France and Italy, Germany's approach does not involve banning any kids from attending elementary school. Spahn, the Germany health minister, said this is because school education is compulsory by law; the same does not apply to kindergarten attendance, hence the ban there.

There are differing opinions on the subject across health officials from various states. For example, the health minister in Hessen has come out in favor of better education as a way of encouraging vaccination, rather than forcing them on people, but the health minister in Saxony favors mandatory shots.

In early April [2019], amid rumors of Spahn's proposal to introduce fines, an organization called Doctors for Individual Vaccine Choice launched a petition against it. The petition has gathered steam in recent days, and currently stands at around 94 000 signatures.

"We have a problem with the trust in this technology, and the more mandatory you make it, the more people will be skeptical about it," said Stefan Schmidt-Troschke, an alternative-medicine pediatrician who acts as the group's spokesman.

Schmidt-Troschke said he is certainly no anti-vaxxer but said given the high vaccination rates for small children, the government should focus more on getting kids to take that 2nd booster shot and leave it to local regional authorities to decide on how to address vaccinations.

Other medical professionals agree more kids need to be brought back for their 2nd shot but object to leaving vaccine enforcement to regional authorities. For example, Frank Ulrich Montgomery, the president of the Federal Medical Association, said in a statement that Spahn's proposal was "an important step at the right time."

"We find it [to be] a good proposal," said Dr. Hermann Josef Kahl, the spokesman for the German Association of Pediatricians. He said his organization also wanted to see the introduction of a national vaccination registry to make it easier to remind people about that 2nd shot.

Regarding the suggestion that forcing the issue with fines and kindergarten bans would increase distrust, Kahl said time will tell.

"We had a lot of proposals in the last 10-15 years, and they didn't have the effect we wanted," he said. "We should try this law. If it doesn't help, we can cancel it again."

[9] Lancet: vaccine hesitancy
Date: Wed 1 May 2019
Source: WHO [edited]
https://www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/vaccine_hesitancy/en/


Additional source: Editorial: Vaccine hesitancy: a generation at risk. The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health. 1 May 2019; 3(5): 281. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2352-4642(19)30092-6


Vaccine hesitancy, which is defined by WHO as a "delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services," has been reported in more than 90% of countries in the world. In many areas, immunisation for measles, a vaccine-preventable disease that was largely eliminated following widespread use of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, has decreased to less than the 95% threshold set by WHO as that required for herd immunity.

In the UK, for example, coverage of the MMR vaccine decreased to 91.2%, the 4th annual decline in a row and to its lowest level since 2011-12. In the USA, the percentage of children aged 19-35 months who received the MMR vaccine slightly decreased from 91.6% in 2011, to 91.5% in 2017, with very low rates of coverage reported in some communities (e.g., 60% in ultra-Orthodox Jews in the state of New York, where a measles outbreak is ongoing). Similar trends elsewhere have resulted in a 30% rise in measles cases worldwide -- even in countries such as the USA, where measles had been eradicated in 2000 -- prompting WHO to declare vaccine hesitancy one of the 10 biggest threats to global health.

[10] US counties at risk
Date: Thu 9 May 2019
Source: Science Daily [edited]
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/05/190509193351.htm


A team of researchers has identified 25 US counties that are most likely to experience measles outbreaks in 2019. Their analysis is based on international air travel volume, non-medical exemptions from childhood vaccinations, population data, and reported measles outbreak information.

The predictions were published today [Thu 9 May 2019] in The Lancet Infectious Diseases [see citation below].

"There has been a resurgence of measles cases, among other vaccine-preventable diseases, in the US and other countries in recent years. Measles, in particular, poses a serious public health threat due to the highly contagious nature of the disease. It is therefore critical that we proactively identify areas most likely to experience outbreaks to strategically target for surveillance and control," says Lauren Gardner, an associate professor in the Johns Hopkins Department of Civil Engineering and one of the study's corresponding authors.

Cook County, Illinois, tops the list, followed by Los Angeles County, California; Miami-Dade County, Florida; Queens, New York; and King County, Washington. The researchers have made available an interactive web tool that maps counties and codes them by risk:
http://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/33c650a3740f478e99e308da9e5908ec.

As of late April [2019], the US has seen more than 700 cases of measles this year [2019], the highest number in decades. Although measles was officially eliminated from the US in 2000, the ongoing outbreak shows that the nation remains at risk.

The recent spike in cases, the researchers say, is due to reintroduction by international travelers from countries experiencing measles outbreaks, compounded by low vaccination rates in certain localities that are fueled in part by an increasingly visible anti-vaccination movement.

"Anti-vaxxers are denying the best and very successful medical science we have and choosing instead to rely on fraudulent claims, such as a purported link to autism, that have been uniformly debunked by evidence and analysis over the last 2 decades," says Sahotra Sarkar, professor of philosophy and integrative biology at the University of Texas at Austin and the study's other corresponding author.

To identify the top 25 US counties most likely to experience outbreaks in 2019, the research team performed a risk analysis that took the following county data into account: non-medical exemption rates, anonymous full-route passenger travel data from all international airports, population and size, and location of measles outbreaks globally.

The analysis correctly identified regions in Washington, Oregon, and New York that have already seen major measles outbreaks this year [2019]. Furthermore, the vast majority of counties that have reported measles cases as of April 2019 are included in the team's top 25 at-risk counties or lie adjacent to one of the top 25 counties. Additionally, the analysis specified the following countries that contribute most to measles risk in the US: India, China, Mexico, Japan, Ukraine, Philippines, and Thailand.

"Our prediction is aligned with multiple counties that have experienced measles outbreaks this year [2019]. Critically, we recommend that public health officials and policymakers prioritize monitoring the counties we identify to be at high risk that have not yet reported cases, especially those that lie adjacent to counties with ongoing outbreaks and those that house large international airports," says Gardner.

Sarkar adds that policymakers must focus on centers of vaccination resistance, as well as regions with a lot of passenger inflow from affected countries worldwide if there are even small local pockets of unvaccinated people. "The New York borough of Brooklyn is a perfect example, with a large number of unvaccinated members of an orthodox Jewish community even though the overall county vaccination rate is not low."
