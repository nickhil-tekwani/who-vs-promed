Wheat Warning - New Rust Could Spread Like Wildfire
-----------------------------------------------
As the world's population continues to grow, so does its appetite for
cereal grains, which include such dietary staples as wheat. This growing
demand has driven agricultural scientists to develop higher yielding grain
varieties. However, wheat growers face a challenging threat to bountiful
yields with the emergence of a new and virulent fungal pathogen. It stands
poised to hammer wheat yields globally, according to data released this
month [September 2005] in Nairobi, Kenya at an international symposium
convened to address the blight.
The new fungal pathogen, a variant of the black-stem rust fungus (_Puccinia
graminis_, Pg), has been labeled Ug99 for the nation Uganda and the year in
which its emergence was formally recognized. Ug99 has been popping up in
fields throughout East Africa. Rusts take their common name from the fact
that the pathogens tend to have a vivid red or orange hue. At the end of a
growing season, black-stem rusts sprout dark spores that can survive
over-winter.
At the Nairobi meeting, officials from the International Center for
Agricultural Research in Dry Areas and the International Maize and Wheat
Improvement Center, an organization best known by its Spanish acronym,
CIMMYT, summed up much of what they know about the Ug99 variant. For
instance, the centers' scientists noted that most wheat currently being
grown around the world has either established susceptibility to the Ug99 or
unknown susceptibility. At present, CIMMYT officials reported that "only
0.3 percent of the more than 44 million hectares planted to known varieties
[of wheat] is moderately resistant to Ug99."
In monitored test plots of wheat, Ug99 reduced grain yields by as much as
71 percent. Its virulence indicates Ug99 "has broken down the sources of
resistance that have provided effective protection [for wheat against
black-stem rusts] for over 30 years," the CIMMYT researchers said.
If not quashed soon, Ug99 infections might bloom into global crop epidemics
within the next 15 years. In Africa alone, CIMMYT projected that
grain-yield losses from such blights could approach USD one billion. Such
events would increase the price of wheat on global markets and contribute
to regional food shortages. These risks are especially grave for developing
nations where reliance on wheat is high and budgets for fungicides are
almost nonexistent, CIMMYT noted.
At the meeting, CIMMYT officials circulated a new report on Ug99's threat.
They also announced plans to upgrade or develop new research centers in the
heart of East Africa. These facilities will be screening local wheat
cultivars for newly mutated genes that might confer resistance to Ug99 and
then launching efforts to breed new lines of wheat carrying those genes.
Although wheat growers around the world had recently come to view stem rust
as a thing of the past, the new CIMMYT report says, "new data show that
such an assumption is no longer, and probably never was, warranted."
Pesticides are not the answer.
East Africa has long been a breeding ground for new and virulent stem
rusts, probably because the area has a mild climate and farmers plant wheat
year-round.
Ordinarily, stem-rust spores move only short distances, one stem infecting
another as they brush against each other. However, Ug99 makes 5 distinct
types of spores. Of these, the one known as the urediniospore is especially
infectious and unique in its ability to ride on air currents. Winds can
carry these spores for hundreds or even thousands of miles.
Until recently, the threat of such long-range rust spread was largely
discounted, because scientists believed that ultraviolet light from the sun
would kill spores that got swept into high-altitude wind currents and then
hitchhiked there for days. To the contrary, recent studies have shown that
fungal spores have survived wind transport from Africa to at least as far
as the Caribbean (SN: 10/06/01, p. 218).
Although large-scale commercial growers typically use fungicides to control
rusts, these chemicals are costly. Spraying can run to more than USD 100
per hectare (0.4 acre), CIMMYT notes.
That exceeds the budget of farmers in developing countries. Therefore,
ignoring these small growers' needs for Ug99-resistant cultivars risks
launching frequent and potentially uncontrollable black-stem rust epidemics
from untreated fields.
Epidemic pending?
Until a half-century ago, many popular wheat varieties were vulnerable to
many variants of Pg. Mention of their sighting would trigger terror in the
hearts of farmers, since an infection could rapidly render a healthy field
of wheat into "a black tangle of broken stems and shriveled grain," the
CIMMYT report says.
These fungal blights periodically triggered disastrous epidemics, until
breeders began intense efforts to select and breed wheat lines with genes
resistant to black-stem disease. Indeed, CIMMYT and its predecessor
organization, created in 1943, owe their origins to global campaigns aimed
at countering this wheat rust.
The success of those breeding efforts "has led to complacency throughout
the wheat community," observes Norman E. Borlaug, the 91-year-old Nobel
prize winner credited with launching the "green revolution." It harnessed
intensive plant-breeding programs to improve yields of wheat, maize, and
other plants that serve as dietary staples in developing countries.
Although Ug99 appears confined to Africa at this time, CIMMYT reports that
epidemics of less-virulent wheat-stem rusts have occurred in Turkey,
Australia, Paraguay, and the U.S. Midwest. These outbreaks indicate that
commonly planted wheat cultivars are vulnerable to Ug99 and other Pg
variants, according to CIMMYT.
In his preface to the new CIMMYT report, Borlaug observes that breeders
around the world have acknowledged that "resistance to stem rust was no
longer a leading breeding objective." And that is what makes the recent
outbreak of Ug99 in East Africa so troubling, he says.
Borlaug pointed out that, like wildfires, the spread of stem rust relies on
favorable climate conditions, air movement, fuel (in this case, susceptible
wheat), ignition points, and complacency. "Once started, both [wildfires
and rust epidemics] are difficult to stop," he says.
That's why Borlaug argues that mobilization against this blight is
imperative. "The prospect of a stem-rust epidemic in wheat in Africa, Asia,
and the Americas is real and must be stopped before it causes untold damage
and human suffering," he warns.
At the meeting in Nairobi, CIMMYT thanked Borlaug for "bringing this
problem to the attention of the international community" and vowed it would
indeed be launching a new Global Rust Initiative.
