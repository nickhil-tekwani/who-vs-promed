[1] Risks of omicron
Date: Mon 20 Dec 2021
Source: The New Yorker [abridged, edited]

For much of the past year, Americans have guided their behavior using a kind of cognitive triangulation. First, we've judged the risks of a coronavirus infection; 2nd, we've assessed our willingness to accept those risks; and 3rd, we've mulled the value, or perhaps the necessity, of our proposed activities. You may be willing to risk an encounter with the virus to do your job, or to attend your daughter's graduation, but a trip to the dentist? Maybe not.

The last 2 variables are largely matters of disposition, values, and circumstance. No epidemiological model can transform you from a wallflower into a risktaker or tell you whether something is "worth it." It's the 1st variable -- the dangers of infection -- that science is best positioned to illuminate. And yet those risks sometimes seem to change by the month, if not the week. Immunity ebbs, variants emerge, and the virus surges and fades. Right now, with the rise of the omicron variant, the pandemic is shifting. Although the risk calculus remains largely unchanged for some people, others -- especially those whom doctors describe as "vulnerable" to COVID-19 -- may be entering a newly dangerous phase of the pandemic.

Who is vulnerable? How concerned should they be? And for how long will they need to remain on high alert?

Vulnerability is at the center of how doctors think. When we describe our patients to one another, we use "one-liners" -- succinct, sentence-long summaries of who patients are and why they are seeking care. One-liners center on age and pre-existing conditions. The goal is the division of patients into categories of risk -- that is, risk stratification. A healthy 35-year-old man coming in with chest pain? We think of a muscle strain, not a heart attack. A 65-year-old woman with 2 recent cardiac stents? Now a heart attack leaps to the fore. There can be surprises: the young man might have an unappreciated family history of early cardiac disease, and the older woman might just have finished a half-marathon. Still, the odds are the odds.

Omicron is thought to be at least twice as transmissible as delta, which itself is twice as contagious as the original; it may be more than 3 times as effective at reinfecting those who've already contracted the coronavirus. But it doesn't transform our risk stratification. Those who were most vulnerable to alpha or delta are still the people who are most susceptible to the new variant. There will be exceptions -- a young vaccinated person who ends up in the ICU or an elderly smoker with nothing but a stuffy nose -- but, for the most part, the established logic of COVID risk still serves as a reliable guide.

There's one category of vulnerability from which it's possible to escape. A recent analysis examined COVID hospitalizations between June and September -- the post-delta, pre-omicron period. It found that 85% of hospitalized people were unvaccinated. How will omicron change this picture? It's too early to say for certain, but, as the new variant starts to displace delta, a rule of thumb is emerging: to maintain a similar level of protection, you need one more dose than you did before. If 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine were enough to prevent a delta infection, then 3 are needed for omicron; if you've received 2 shots and you get a breakthrough omicron infection, you'll be reasonably protected against severe disease, but you'll be safer if you've received 3. Some organizations -- the NFL, the Metropolitan Opera, a growing number of colleges -- are starting to require booster shots. Others are sure to follow. Overall, however, many Americans are insufficiently immunized. Nationwide, only 6 in 10 people have got 2 shots, and 3 in 10 have received a booster.

People with chronic medical problems make up a 2nd vulnerable group. In general, the chance of having a bad coronavirus infection increases with the number and severity of medical conditions from which you suffer. One study of hospitalized COVID patients found that 95% of them had at least one underlying medical condition; some 60% of US adults have a chronic health problem. Still, not all problems are equally concerning. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified more than a dozen conditions that place individuals at higher risk for severe COVID. People with illnesses affecting the respiratory or immune system -- emphysema, heart problems, cancers, and certain autoimmune diseases that necessitate immunosuppressant drugs -- will remain vulnerable, even after immunization.

Finally, it's impossible to talk about COVID risk without focusing on the role of age. Older people make up the 3rd category of vulnerability. The risks start climbing earlier in life than we'd like. The COVID mortality rate for Americans over the age of 65 is more than 80 times higher than for those in their late teens and 20s, and over-65 have accounted for more than three-quarters of COVID deaths in the USA. The coronavirus has now claimed the lives of at least one in every hundred older Americans. The risk is greatest for those living in nursing homes and long-term care facilities; during the pandemic's 1st year, they constituted less than 1% of the US population but 35% of COVID deaths. That's not to say that younger people should ignore COVID -- in September [2021], it was the leading cause of death among middle-aged Americans -- but the risks of infection are, and will remain, highest for those in their 60s, 70s, and beyond. All of this was true before omicron and remains true now.

Recently, I spoke with Louise Aronson, a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco, who's been counselling older patients on how to navigate the evolving risks of the pandemic. She, too, walks people through a process of risk triangulation. The 1st fact to confront, of course, is that Aronson's patients are vulnerable because of their age. But they differ substantially in their tolerance for risk: "The variability in how people are responding is sort of astonishing," Aronson told me. "There were those people who got their vaccines and went back to the gym and started travelling and going to movies." Others are more cautious by nature and evaluate risks in a fine-grained way: before going to a party, they might find out not just how many people will be there but how many households those guests belong to.

To these variables, she adds an assessment of how important social interaction is to each person. She asks her patients how the pandemic has been for them. "Some people are well-adjusted. I've had a bunch say, 'Wow, I was always a really social person -- I think I might actually be an introvert.'" Alternatively, Aronson tries to gauge if patients are "suffering and miserable." "We've seen a lot of accelerated cognitive and physical decline in certain people," she said. In these cases, "part of harm reduction might be that you actually do need to see other human beings. So now let's think about what you can do to minimize your risk."

[2] Germany (Munich): wastewater
Date: Tue 21 Dec 2021
Source: DETV [edited]
https://detv.us/2021/12/21/more-widespread-than-expected-omikron-discovered-in-munich-wastewater/


The new omicron variant of the coronavirus has been detectable in Munich wastewater for 2 weeks -- and is therefore probably more widespread than previously thought. When examining the wastewater, the variant was detected from 7 Dec 2021, announced the Munich University Clinic as a result of the regular monitoring, which has been analyzing samples from the Munich sewerage system only once a week since April 2020 and now twice a week.

In the latest results, which were available on Monday [20 Dec 2021], wastewater samples from 4 locations in Munich and from a sewage treatment plant were analyzed up to 10 Dec 2021. The researchers found traces of the variant in 5 of 6 samples. "This indicates that the spread of this virus variant in Munich was already greater in calendar week 49 than previously assumed," explained project manager Andreas Wieser from the Tropical Institute. The sequences of strains of the delta variant were still dominant. In the samples previously analyzed up to 3 Dec 2021, there was no evidence of the omicron variant.

The wastewater monitoring in Munich, which began at the beginning of the pandemic, is one of the 1st and longest investigations to track the viral load in wastewater worldwide. Background: Several days often pass between the increase in new infections and the official number of reports, so that the dynamics of the pandemic and the spread of new variants can be identified faster and more effectively using the wastewater analyses.

"Experience with other viral diseases [and now SARS-CoV-2] has shown that monitoring sewage for traces of a pathogen enables effective surveillance of entire communities, providing a sensitive signal of whether the pathogen is present in the population and whether transmission is increasing or declining. Researchers around the world are now pursuing the same approach for COVID-19 with the hope that wastewater data can supplement current measures of its prevalence.... [Wastewater results] could facilitate social distancing interventions before community transmission reaches exponential growth" (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0690-1). - Mod.LK]

[3] Rapid tests
Date: Tue 21 Dec 2021 06:00 EST

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/all-you-need-to-know-about-covid-test-kits-as-cases-surge-again


The emergence of the omicron variant is spurring a scramble for COVID-19 lateral flow tests, to try and ensure safe holiday parties and family gatherings. The UK is dealing with a supply crunch for these cheaper, quicker tests -- known as rapid tests in the USA -- after health officials said last week they are as effective at picking up omicron as delta, the previous most infectious strain.

In the USA, President Joe Biden said he will deliver 500 million free COVID-19 tests to people's homes starting next month [January 2022] and dispatch the military to shore up overwhelmed hospitals as the USA confronts a resurgent pandemic. New York is already handing out rapid test kits, while Vermont issued a mandate that helps people cover testing costs through their insurers in a move that could soon become a federal requirement.

When should you get tested after potential exposure to COVID-19?
----------------------------------------------------------------
The best time to test is 2 or 3 days after exposure to someone who has the virus, according to Irene Petersen, a professor of epidemiology at University College London. That's because it varies when people start to become infectious. If you sat next to someone who had the virus on Friday, then you should get a test on Monday.

I'm going to a Christmas party. When should I get tested?
---------------------------------------------------------
Right before you leave your house, Petersen said. Don't trust a 2-day old negative test, "you might have become infectious in between."

Can I trust a negative lateral flow result?
-------------------------------------------
Don't rely on one test taken a few days after exposure, Petersen said. You should continue to get tested up to about a week after exposure to the virus.

So you tested positive. Now what?
---------------------------------
It is best to trust the rapid test first of all. "It's very likely you have COVID if you get a positive lateral flow test," Petersen said. There are reportedly fewer than one false-positive [results] in every 1000 lateral flow tests carried out.

The official line in the UK is after a positive rapid test you should do a PCR test and self-isolate until you get your result confirmed. If a PCR within 2 days of a rapid test is positive, then you should start isolating for 10 days. If you take a PCR later than that, no matter the result you'll still have to isolate for the full 10 days.

Petersen advises people to stay at home straight away after a positive rapid test, especially if they start having symptoms. "If you have a fever or a runny nose, and a positive lateral flow test, it is infectious," she said.

What's the difference between rapid tests and PCRs?
---------------------------------------------------
A lateral flow test investigates whether you have proteins from the virus in your body. You're most likely to have a high level of these proteins when you're most infectious -- so it may be less accurate just after infection or toward the end of your illness. It's also known as a rapid test because it can be taken at home and gives you the results in as little as 15 minutes.

A PCR test, which identifies the genetic material from the virus, has to be checked and interpreted by a laboratory. It can take up to 2 days to get your results, and they're also more expensive than lateral flows. PCRs are more sensitive at picking up the virus because the genetic material you might have in your samples is amplified in the lab. That means it can pick up the illness earlier than the rapid test. A PCR can detect the virus as early as day 2 and up to 16 days after infection, according to the Robert Koch Institute. With a PCR, you may test positive even if you're not infectious anymore, as you could still have some genetic material from the virus, Petersen said.

How do you get your hands on a lateral flow test?
-------------------------------------------------
In England, you can pick up rapid tests from a pharmacy, order a kit from the list of providers found on the government website or you can go to a test site. Schools, colleges and nurseries and some employers and universities also provide rapid tests free of charge.

[Frequent use of rapid tests, although not perfect, could help control spread of the virus; however, to accomplish this, tests must be freely available to individuals and used frequently when exposure is suspected. They help expose cases of individuals with asymptomatic infections who are potentially spreading the virus. But according to Dr. Eric Topol, an expert in genomics and individualized medicine, in an interview with CNBC Monday (20 Dec 2021), "Rapid coronavirus tests have limitations that Americans must keep in mind.... If we're going to use rapid tests, they've got to be as close proximal to the time of the event as possible, and that would include travel," he said (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/20/how-dr-eric-topol-recommends-using-rapid-covid-tests-amid-omicron-wave.html). - Mod.LK]
