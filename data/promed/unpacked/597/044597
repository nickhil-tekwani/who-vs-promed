[Yemen is endemic for dengue fever and has had several outbreaks since 2009 in many governorates. The past 2 years (2016-2018) have witnessed a sustained transmission of dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever in most of the Red Sea coastal cities of Yemen. The current report is not surprising because there is a large dam at Maarib and much irrigation is undertaken (SB). The poor and collapsing heath infrastructure has also played and is still playing a significant role in this prolonged outbreak. - Mod.UBA]

A total of 7 Illawarra residents have been struck down by dengue fever while holidaying overseas this year [2018], prompting advice from the public health unit. Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District acting public health director Glendon Lee said the figures were consistent with previous years, but were a timely reminder to be travel safe. "In 2017 there were 15 dengue notifications in the ISLHD. When laboratories confirm dengue fever, they notify their local public health unit who follow up each case to determine where the person acquired the infection," he said.

[2a] Wolbachia mosquito release impact
Date: Fri 3 Aug 2018
Source: Daily Mail [edited]
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6022713/Deadly-dengue-fever-wiped-entire-city-anti-virus-mosquitoes.html


Deadly dengue fever has been wiped out for the 1st time across an entire city in Australia, following the release of millions of anti-virus modified mosquitoes. Anti-dengue mosquitoes were released in Townsville, Australia in 2014. No cases have been recorded in the Queensland city, which has around 167 800 residents, since the pests' release. This is compared to 54 dengue cases between 2010 and 2014.

A total of 4 million mosquitoes were infected with Wolbachia bacteria over 2 years. The experiment started in 2014, with scientists infecting mosquitoes with Wolbachia bacteria, which prevents the insects from spreading the virus. These mosquitoes then mated with wild species, causing them to pass on Wolbachia so their offspring also carried the bacteria. This is the 1st time modified mosquitoes have wiped out such a virus across an entire city.

Dengue is not found in the UK but is in Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, South and Central America, Africa, the Pacific Islands, the Indian subcontinent, and Australia. People can reduce their risk of being bitten by dengue-carrying mosquitoes by using DEET insect repellent, wearing loose but protective clothing, and sleeping under a mosquito net.

The scheme could wipe out dengue in hard-hit countries. On the back of Townsville's success, 11 countries, including Brazil and Viet Nam, are trialing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.

Professor Scott O'Neill, director of the programme at Monash University, Melbourne, said: "At a cost of around [15 AUD (11 USD)] per person, the Townsville trial demonstrates the approach can be rolled out quickly, efficiently, and cost effectively to help provide communities ongoing protection from mosquito-borne diseases."

The programme aims to release Wolbachia mosquitoes in larger cities around the world with a target of reducing the cost to just 1 AUD (0.74 USD) per person. The researchers add, however, other countries that are testing the modified mosquito rollout have higher rates of dengue than Australia and therefore the scheme may not work as effectively. Despite their concerns, the scientists add results appear positive so far, the New Scientist reported.

In other research released last May [2018], it is suggested dengue fever may be passed on through sex. Scientists discovered the dengue virus in the semen of a man more than a month after he fell ill while travelling in Thailand. The virus lingering in the man's semen led researchers to believe the condition could be passed on during sex even after the other person has recovered.

The unnamed Italian man, who was in his 50s, was diagnosed with dengue fever last January [2018]. He was otherwise healthy but suffered from joint pain, fatigue and nausea. The man was admitted to the National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome after feeling ill for 9 days. He recovered, with traces of the virus disappearing from his blood and urine after 23 days; however, the pathogen was still present in his semen after 37 days. All traces had disappeared by day 55.

[3] Cost-effectiveness of dengue vaccine
Date: 22 Jul 2018
Source: Journals Plus [edited]
https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/vaccine-preventable-diseases/news/in-the-journals/%7B6a783208-dcec-4f2d-85c7-94af74d3f7fd%7D/study-casts-doubt-on-cost-effectiveness-of-dengue-vaccine


Researchers cast doubt on the cost-effectiveness in some circumstances of screening people for prior dengue infection before immunizing them with Dengvaxia. Dengvaxia (Sanofi Pasteur) is the first licensed vaccine against dengue, the mosquito-borne virus that causes approximately 9000 deaths and an estimated 50 million to 100 million infections worldwide each year. Research has shown, however, that receiving the vaccine increases the risk for severe disease and hospitalization in patients with no prior exposure to the virus. Based on these findings, the WHO recommended that the vaccine be administered only to individuals who have serological confirmation of past dengue exposure.

To evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of serologic screening before administering Dengvaxia, Alex Perkins, PhD, Eck Family Assistant Professor of biological sciences at the University of Notre Dame, and colleagues simulated dengue transmission over 30 years, both with and without vaccination, under economic scenarios representative of Brazil and the Philippines. "We found that public health impact depended primarily on the sensitivity or serological screening in high-transmission settings and on a combination of sensitivity and specificity in low-transmission settings," they wrote.

Perkins emphasized the need for the serological screening to be as accurate as possible. "Getting that wrong will lead to an increase in a person's chance of experiencing severe disease if they get infected with dengue virus later on," he told Infectious Disease News.

After examining cost-effectiveness from a public payer or individual perspective, the researchers determined that from a public payer perspective, vaccination following serological screening is unlikely to be cost-effective except in countries with relatively high gross domestic product and a low screening cost.
From an individual perspective, they predicted, vaccination following serological screening would potentially be cost-effective under a range of scenarios at slightly higher threshold cost, contingent on high specificity of screenings.

What does this mean for vaccinations in low-income countries? Perkins said decisions about whether to adopt this vaccine and how to go about distributing it are made at a national level. "Different countries have different considerations that factor into making that decision," he said. "In addition, though, there is the potential for individual people to decide to pursue vaccination with Dengvaxia."

People electing to pursue vaccination on their own would need to consider how accurate the test is in determining whether they have been infected with dengue virus in the past. They would also need to consider how much they are willing to pay to potentially avoid dengue.
