As Puerto Rico enters its 4th week post Hurricane Maria [20 Sep 2017], most hospitals continue to be powered only by electric generators and some of them have intermittently collapsed. As the hospitals systems continue to be in a fragile condition, cases suspicious for leptospirosis continue to present on the island. Leptospirosis is endemic in Puerto Rico and its initial symptoms are almost identical to dengue, which is also endemic in the island. Hurricane seasons in Puerto Rico (from May to November) are very rainy, which promote a rise in mosquito and consequently dengue cases. An increase in cases of leptospirosis is also perceived during this rainy period. This season, unfortunately Hurricane Maria hit the island causing flooding and destruction. This, along the continued cleaning efforts, has exposed many people to possible contaminated environments. The cases of suspected leptospirosis were first documented 1-2 weeks after the hurricane, which is compatible with the bacteria incubation period. This 1st wave of cases should be the biggest, but as cleaning, reconstruction efforts, and seasonal rains continue, further exposure is expected.

Leptospirosis definitive diagnosis in Puerto Rico continues to be a challenge, and even more during this historic moment. Although physicians are maintaining a high index of suspicion and low threshold to give antibiotics in clinically compatible cases, many symptomatic patients could be missed. The only commercial laboratory test available to us is IgM. This is an indirect test and depends on the host immune response, not the bacteria. In the clinical practice, it is common to care for patients with leptospirosis that, even when having Weil syndrome [dysfunction of the kidneys and liver, abnormal enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly), persistent yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, and whites of the eyes (jaundice), and/or alterations in consciousness], have the initial IgM test result falsely negative.

The CDC has a PCR test for reference testing, but having to ship samples is hard at this moment, plus communications for test results are unstable and limited. It is clear that we need direct leptospirosis tests done in the local hospitals, and since many institutions already have PCR capabilities, it should not be difficult to habilitate our equipment if we are given the primers. So far, in institutions were procalcitonin levels are done, what we have noticed is marked elevation of plasma procalcitonin levels, making it an interesting marker to monitor in cases of suspected leptospirosis. Further research and experience will tell if it could be used as an initial test to attempt to differentiate potential leptospirosis cases from dengue or influenza. Further access to leptospira PCR and possibly point of care procalcitonin could aid to better diagnose patients in Puerto Rico during catastrophic events like Hurricane Maria.

[Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall and flooding with fresh water. Parts of Puerto Rico saw more than 30 inches (76.2 cm) of rain and subsequent flooding with recent Hurricane Maria. A map showing the estimated rainfall across Puerto Rico with this hurricane is available at https://twitter.com/NWSSanJuan/status/910983698597777409/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url.

Manatí, where Dr Martinez practices, is a municipality with a population of 43 772 residents in 2011, about 51 km (31.7 mi) west of San Juan, Puerto Rico, on the northern coast and is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area. Manatí is in an area that received 16-20 inches of rainfall during Hurricane Maria (https://twitter.com/NWSSanJuan/status/910983698597777409/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url). - Mod.ML
