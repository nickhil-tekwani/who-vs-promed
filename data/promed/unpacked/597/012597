Regarding your rightly identified need for "more than a cursory
analysis of migratory bird pathways," may I draw your attention to
the report we had on New Scientist today [8 Feb 2006]. One should, I
understand, not read too much into the "flyways" you cite; the real
migratory pathways differ for each species. The best available
species-by-species migration route atlas for the area describes how,
in 2 species of duck, the same breeding population that spent the
summer in H5N1-affected areas of Siberia, then went to the Black Sea
coast and Turkey in autumn, also went to precisely the area of
Nigeria now affected. One of their largest wintering wetlands in west
Africa is just east of Kano.
The article was posted before we found out the strain in Nigeria is
apparently Qinghai, that is, the same one found in wild birds at
Qinghai Lake, then across Siberia, then in Turkey and around the
Black Sea coast. That is exactly what one expects for wild bird
spread. (The probability of that spread was also strongly supported
by a PNAS paper this week, Chen et al.) This might theoretically be
down to people shipping infected meat or poultry waste to the
affected areas, but I can't see why that would all be exactly the
same strain of H5N1 every time, and never the Z genotype that has
dominated east Asian outbreaks.
That PNAS paper also showed it is poultry that maintain the virus in
a region, spread it locally, and give it to people, not wild birds.
Now the virus is in poultry in Africa; that is where action must be
taken: stamping out, and if possible, giving African farmers the
means to isolate their poultry from wild birds, a tall order. But any
action taken against wild birds in Africa now, as the FAO and bird
experts have repeatedly said, is a very bad idea; it will not solve
problems caused primarily by poultry and will just make matters worse
by dispersing the birds. Virologists say the H5N1 virus will evolve
into insignificance in wild populations as long as it is not
replenished by continued maintenance of the highly pathogenic strain
in the poultry, where it probably evolved.

H5N1 bird flu reaches Africa
-------------------------------
The H5N1 bird flu virus has been confirmed in north-central Nigeria.
Scientists had feared the virus would reach Africa, where human
poverty and disease could combine with millions of highly susceptible
backyard poultry to produce many human infections and potentially a
human pandemic virus.
But New Scientist can reveal that the location of Africa's 1st
reported outbreak should not come as a surprise. The region affected
is right beside a major wintering ground for 2 relatively common
species of duck. Those ducks shared breeding grounds in Siberia last
summer [2005] with birds that winter in Turkey and around the Black
Sea, where the virus also appeared recently.
"We are facing a serious international crisis," said Samuel Jutzi,
head of animal health at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization in
Rome, Italy. He is pleading for any further die-offs of poultry in
the region to be reported immediately.
The World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) in Paris, France, reported
on Wednesday [8 Feb 2006] that 40 000 poultry, mainly laying hens,
have died since 10 Jan 2006 at a commercial farm near Igabi in Kaduna
state, a small town 150 km south of the northern city of Kano. The
owners initially tried antibiotics.
But the cause has now been confirmed as H5N1 by the OIE's
collaborating center for bird flu in Padua, Italy. There is no word
yet on whether it is the highly pathogenic strain that has killed at
least 88 people in East Asia, Turkey and, most recently, Iraq.
However, that seems likely. The virus appears to be having a
devastating impact on poultry in the region, with Nigerian
agricultural authorities reporting the deaths of 150 000 birds in
Kano and Kaduna states.
Furthermore, Kano is near the Hadejia-Nguru inland river delta, which
is a major wintering location for Northern pintail and garganey
ducks. They summer in breeding grounds across Siberia, where there
were numerous outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry and wild birds last summer
[2005]. Birds of those species that winter in Turkey and around the
Black Sea also summered in the same places in Siberia, and migrants
are thought to have carried H5N1 there.
The authoritative 1996 Atlas of Anatidae [ducks, geese and swans]
Populations of Africa and Western Europe says the Northern pintail
wintering in the Black Sea and Mediterranean basins "are lumped with
those wintering in West Africa as a single large population." On
average, 18 000 pintails winter each year at Hadejia-Nguru. Similar
numbers of garganey ducks follow the same migration, and 500 000 of
each species winter at nearby Lake Chad.
Some of the Northern pintail wintering now in Britain and along
Europe's North Sea and Atlantic coasts also spent last summer [2005]
on the same breeding grounds as the pintail that subsequently flew to
the Black Sea, Turkey and West Africa.

[The debate on the source of infection has become rather academic at
this stage; the event highlights several factors which should be of
concern to the international authorities engaged with the prevention
and control of highly pathogenic avian influenza.
According to the official Nigerian notification, the outbreak, in a
large poultry layers commercial farm, started on 10 Jan 2006. Samples
were, reportedly, taken (by whom?) on 16 Jan 2006. The birds were
treated by the owner with broad-spectrum antibiotics until the
confirmation of infection (probably suspecting a bacterial disease,
e.g. Pasteurellosis?!). It is not clear which, if any, effective
quarantine measures have been applied throughout the said period,
while the birds must have stopped laying eggs already at an early
stage of the outbreak, during which not less than 91.3 % of them (42
000/46 000) went down with disease, with 95.2% (40 000/42 000)
mortality. The reportedly applied stamping out, could have had little
effect at this stage; probably - and hopefully - it included the
other, less susceptible avian species on the farm, but details are
lacking. The official notification to the OIE was sent on 6 Feb 2006;
a copy of the laboratory confirmation (in Padua) reached the OIE on 7
Feb 2006. There is a low chance of success in containing a highly
infectious animal disease such as H5N1 HPAI, when more than 3 weeks
elapse between sampling and (published) results.
Clearly, a significant and urgent improvement in surveillance and
alertness is in need, especially in receptive, vulnerable areas.
