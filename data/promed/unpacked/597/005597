An outbreak of strep zoo will close the doors of the Fort McMurray SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) until 7 Mar 2013.

The SPCA has announced a temporary closure of the shelter at the recommendation of a veterinarian due to an isolated outbreak of _Streptococcus equi sub sp. zooepidemicus_, or strep zoo, in one dog at the shelter.

The highly contagious illness is easily spread and can be passed between species, making it necessary for SPCA staff to take precautionary measures.

Strep zoo causes severe respiratory infection and can lead to hemorrhagic pneumonia, explained the SPCA release. The infection can be spread through sneezing, coughing, respiratory discharge, and can survive in the environment for up to 2 weeks if left un-sanitized.

The SPCA is recommending anyone who has visited the shelter or had an animal come in contact with an SPCA animal in the last 10 days to bear in mind the following information:

* If you notice any respiratory signs in your own animals such as sneezing, runny nose, or bloody discharge of any kind, call your vet immediately, and explain this notice to them. They may simply ask you to pick up medication instead of bringing the animal into their clinic.

* Keep any animal with clinical signs isolated from other animals.

* Minimize handling the sick animal, and change your clothes, and wash hands thoroughly.

* Do not let any human that may be ill or immune-suppressed handle the animal.

* For more information, contact your veterinarian or the SPCA at 780-743-8997.

[The 1st recognized human case of _Streptococcus equi, sub sp. zooepidemicus_ (a Lancefield group C Streptococcus) was in a farmer who presumably was infected by his sheep dog. In humans, infections caused by _S. zooepidemicus_ are a rare event, resulting in meningitis, bacteraemia, acute nephritis, septic arthritis, pneumonia, and in some cases, death of the patient (Barnham et al., 1987; Efstratiou, 1997; Thorley et al., 2007; Ural et al., 2003). In the majority of these cases, consumption of unpasteurized milk or direct contact with horses was considered the most likely source of infection.

In this particular report, the dog may have picked up the bacteria from the horses, and over approximately 3 weeks of sneezing, coughing, and general chronic respiratory signs, may have transmitted it to the male owner/care taker.

Given the seriousness of the signs in people, this shelter may have been closed because of the possibility of transmitting the infection to the shelter workers. Another issue of caution is that the infected pet may transmit it to other pets, and then perhaps to other owners. Hence, it is critical to isolate the affected pet.

_S. zooepidemicus_ has been reported as an opportunistic pathogen associated with invasive infections in laboratory and domestic animals (Francis et al., 1993). A commensal organism in horses, it is also associated with respiratory tract infections in foals and young horses (Chanter, 1997; Downar et al., 2001) and with equine abortion (Giles et al., 1993). In cattle, _S. zooepidemicus_ has been described as an occasional cause of mastitis (Edwards et al., 1988), and in dogs is associated with respiratory conditions such as canine infectious respiratory disease and HSP (Chalker et al., 2003; Pesavento et al., 2008). It is not, however, normally associated with chronic respiratory infection in dogs. Infection is uncommon in humans (Francis et al., 1993), and _S. zooepidemicus_ accounts for less than one percent of all bacteraemias (CFSPH, 2005) but has been described as the most virulent of the Lancefield Group C streptococci that infect humans (Bradley et al., 1991). Mortality rates following infections with _S. zooepidemicus_ are twice as high as those associated with cases of _S. equisimilis_ (Bradley et al., 1991).

This organism is recognized as causing severe and chronic respiratory conditions in dogs, but the case above is the 1st indication that the dogs may be able to transmit it to human beings.
