A rare disease never seen in the southern hemisphere before, named
tularaemia, has been discovered in Tasmania, Australia, state Deputy
Director of Public Health, Dr Chrissie Pickin, confirmed on Fri 4 Nov
2011.

2 women contracted tularemia after being bitten and scratched by sick
possums in western Tasmania. While the disease is well known in North
America and parts of Europe and Asia, it is believed the Tasmanian
cases are the 1st in the southern hemisphere.

Veterinarian Dr James Harris said it has a range of effects on humans.
"It can cause a septicemia, an infection which circulates in the
blood, and may cause pneumonia and unless it is treated, it can be a
fatal disease," he said in a statement. "(It can be) treated with
antibiotics very successfully."

Pickin said both cases have recovered, and warned people to avoid
handling wild animals and see their physician if scratched or bitten.

An investigation has been launched into how 2 people developed a very
rare infection, following contact with possums in western Tasmania.
Specialized testing was needed to establish the diagnosis of
tularemia, an infection due to a bacterium called _Francisella
tularensis_. These infections appear to be the 1st in the southern
hemisphere due to this particular strain of the bacterium.

There are a number of different strains of the _Francisella
tularensis_ bacterium. Current indications are that both Tasmanian
cases are due to one of the milder strains, which causes a persistent
but treatable skin infection.

After being bitten and scratched by possums in the Queenstown-Zeehan
area earlier in 2011, each person developed persistent skin infections
at the sites of their injuries and in their lymph glands. Both cases
were treated by their general practitioners and specialists, and are
now recovering.

As this is such a rare infection in the southern hemisphere, a joint
investigation with the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water
and Environment has been launched. While tularemia is well known and
understood in many parts of the northern hemisphere, its ecology in
the southern hemisphere is largely unknown.

[_Francisella tularensis_, the etiologic agent of tularemia, is a
facultative intracellular pathogen known to infect numerous animal
species, including humans, and is a category A bioterrorism agent. _F.
tularensis_ is divided into subspecies, _Francisella tularensis subsp.
tularensis_, _F. tularensis subsp. holarctica_, and _F. tularensis
subsp. mediasiatica_, which differ in their pathogenicities and
geographic distributions. _Francisella novicida_, officially
recognized as another species within the _Francisella_ genus, is
considered the 4th subspecies of _F. tularensis_ on the basis of its
similarity in DNA hybridization experiments.

_F. tularensis subsp. tularensis_ causes life-threatening type A
tularemia and is found only in North America. _F. tularensis subsp.
holarctica_ causes less-severe type B tularemia and is found
throughout the northern hemisphere. _F. tularensis subsp.
mediasiatica_ has virulence similar to that of _F. tularensis subsp.
holarctica_ but is geographically restricted, having been isolated
only from central Asia. _Francisella tularensis subsp. novicida_ is
the least virulent subspecies, having been isolated only rarely in
North America and has been reported once in the Northern Territory of
Australia. This report from 2003 (Whipp MJ, Davis JM, Lum G, et al:
Characterization of a novicida-like subspecies of Francisella
tularensis isolated in Australia. J Med Microbiol. 2003;52: 839-842)
described a "novicida-like" subspecies of _F. tularensis_ from a foot
wound sustained in brackish water in the Northern Territory of
Australia.

Based on this report from 8 years ago, this posting is not the 1st
isolation of _F. tularensis_ in Australia but the 1st in Tasmania. It
is not specifically stated in the posting what subspecies was
identified. ProMED awaits more information regarding this isolate
related to 2 cases of ulceroglandular tularemia in Tasmania. - Mod.LL]
