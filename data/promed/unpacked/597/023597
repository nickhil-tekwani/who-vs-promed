Nanbu: a human case of severe pneumonia by avian influenza virus H5N6
---------------------------------------------------------------------
In recent years Sichuan province has intensified and improved the sensitivity of its surveillance addressing influenza-like illness and unexplained cases of pneumonia in human patients. Recently, a throat swab sampled from a case of severe pneumonia in Nanchong city, was found positive for nucleic acid of avian influenza virus H5N6. This was confirmed by the China Disease Prevention and Control Center.

The patient, a 49-year-old male, clinically diagnosed by a joint group of experts of the provincial and municipal rescue team as suffering acute severe pneumonia, died. He had a history of exposure to sick and dead poultry in Nanbu County, Nanchong City. All his close contacts did not show abnormal health signs. Experts consider this case as a human infection with avian influenza virus, They consider the spread risk as low.

To prevent respiratory diseases, experts advise the public to provide for satisfactory indoor ventilation, reasonable rest, reducing stays in crowded air spaces, routinely wash hands, cover mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, cater for general personal hygiene, and refrain from coming in contact with dead poultry or consuming produce from such animals. It is recommended to buy poultry meat from freshly slaughtered healthy animals. If frozen poultry is purchased, one should look for the accompanying veterinary certificates of origin. People having any symptoms of influenza should seek immediate medical attention.

Avian influenza virus subtype H5N6 detected in poultry in Nanbu County, Nanchong City
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Since 23 Apr 2014, the Sichuan veterinary department has been investigating chickens of a sick farmer who was found positive for avian influenza in Nanbu County, Nanchong City. Samples from the poultry were submitted to the National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory. On 3 May 2014, the reference laboratory isolated avian influenza virus subtype H5N6 from the samples.

Following the detection of the positive samples in Sichuan Province, the local emergency response, plan, and control team, has performed the prescribed control measures in accordance with the official specifications. The group of positive birds were culled and disinfection applied. Surveillance and monitoring activities in the area surrounding the farm are being carried out; so far, no abnormalities have been found.

[To the best of our knowledge, this is the 1st human case of H5N6; correction, if available, will be welcomed. Since no information on clinical disease in the chickens has been reported, it may be assumed that the causative agent is a low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) strain. LPAI H5N6 strains have been recorded in wild birds in several continents in the past. For example, on 15 Dec 2004 Taiwan reported 2 strains of avian flu in migratory birds in the northern part of the island, the milder H5N2 strain and also the H5N6 strain (see ProMED-mail post 20051010.2949).

H5N6 virus has been used as a poultry vaccine strain; similarly to H5N2, it was used as a DIVA or "differentiating infected from vaccinated animals." It was also shown that cats can be protected against a lethal high-dose challenge infection with HPAI H5N1 by an inactivated, adjuvanted heterologous H5N6 avian influenza virus vaccine (http://jgv.sgmjournals.org/content/89/4/968.full).

A preliminary report on the human case described in China was published on 23 Apr 2014. The title in the Chinese newspaper was "An official Nanbu microbiologist said a farmer suffering from severe pneumonia is suspected of bird flu"; see http://region.scdaily.cn/jrsz/content/2014-04/23/content_7761608.htm?node=3538 [Chinese].

The detection of LPAI H5N6 in poultry in Nanbu, Nanchong, Sichuan has been officially notified today, 5 May 2014, to the OIE. See at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=15200.
