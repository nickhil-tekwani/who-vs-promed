Officials identify 2 cases of hepatitis A after sewage backup in Detroit [Michigan]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 cases of hepatitis A have been identified in people who were in contact with sewage during a recent backup, health officials from the Detroit Health Department and Michigan Department of Health and Human Services announced.

Health officials recommended anyone who has come in contact with raw sewage should contact their doctor. Help is also available at the Detroit Health Department.

[It is unclear if those affected were city workers involved in the cleanup of the sewage or homeowners. Certainly workers whose jobs involve potential contact with raw sewage should be vaccinated with the hepatitis A vaccine, which is now part of universal immunization for children in the USA. Other pathogens transmissible through raw sewage include viruses such as norovirus and rotavirus and other bacteria such as _E. coli_, _Salmonella_, _Shigella_ and _Campylobacter_. - Mod.LL
