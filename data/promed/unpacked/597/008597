An estimated 90 percent of a bighorn sheep herd in the East Humboldt
and Ruby Mountain ranges died during a catastrophic pneumonia event
during the winter of 2009-10. The bighorns, introduced in 1992,
numbered 180 animals in 2009.

About 110 bighorns were believed to have died from disease in the Hays
Canyon Range in 2008. The herd was introduced to the mountain chain
about 50 miles northwest of Gerlach in 1989.

About 100 bighorns, 1/3rd of the herd, died from pneumonia in the
Santa Rosa Mountains in 2004. Bighorns were 1st introduced there in
1978 and numbered about 300 by 2003.

Disease might decimate a herd of bighorn sheep that Nevada biologists
previously thought faced a promising future.

California bighorn sheep are dying of pneumonia in the Snowstorm
Mountains about 30 miles northeast of Winnemucca. It's unknown exactly
how many have succumbed in what is a rare summertime die-off, but
things don't look good, said Ken Gray, an Elko-based supervisory game
biologist with the Nevada Department of Wildlife.

"We could be down to 50 percent of the population already," Gray said.
"It's a real serious situation. We think we're going to lose 80 to 90
percent, maybe even 100 percent of that herd."

The news is particularly bad, Gray said, because the herd's future
looked so encouraging.

"It was one of those herds that was really starting to take off," Gray
said. "We had huge confidence this herd was going to be one of our
best."

Before the arrival of European settlers and disease-carrying domestic
sheep in the west, 3 species of bighorns -- California, Rocky Mountain
and Desert -- thrived across the mountains of Nevada.

The animal's population tanked, and by the 1960s, they existed only in
the southernmost part of the state.

An aggressive reintroduction program followed, with sheep captured in
Oregon, Idaho, Southern Nevada and other locations and replanted in
mountain ranges of Northern Nevada. The Nevada Department of Wildlife
estimates there are now in excess of 9900 of the 3 types of bighorn
living in the state. Relocation of bighorns to the Snowstorm Mountains
started in 1985 when 9 animals brought from Idaho were placed on the
Owyhee Bluffs. More bighorns were brought in over the years, and
estimates early this summer [2011] had the population at about 140.

In August 2011, NDOW received reports of domestic sheep wandering in
bighorn habitat in the Snowstorms. During a bighorn survey from 17-18
Aug [2011], biologists noticed numbers were lower than expected, that
bighorns appeared to be sick, and no lambs were to be found. Two dead
bighorns were found.

Biologists concluded that a disease event was occurring, and
subsequent tests of dead bighorns confirmed the presence of bacterial
pneumonia, Gray said.

Die-offs typically occur in the winter, when bighorns tend to be
closer together and are stressed by weather conditions. A summer
die-off is "pretty unusual," Gray said.

"We think it's a pretty widespread, pretty devastating event that's
going on in the Snowstorms," Gray said.

Gray can't say whether interaction with domestic sheep is responsible
for the current situation, though it's a possibility. Biologists knew
they were attempting to establish the Snowstorm herd near a place
where hundreds of domestic sheep regularly wander. "To us, it was a
risk worth taking," he said.

The wildlife department is currently working on refining policy to
encourage increased separation of bighorns and domestic sheep,
officials said. "We're not trying to point fingers. We're just trying
to find a way to keep the sheep separate," NDOW spokesman Chris Healy
said.

A significant die-off comes with consequences. Healy estimated that it
costs about USD 1000 to trap and relocate each bighorn, with that cost
typically borne by sportsmen organizations like Nevada Bighorns
Unlimited.

Representatives of Nevada Bighorns could not be reached. But in a
recent message to the group's membership, outgoing President Mike
Bertoli wrote of his concern over last year's [2010] die-off that
claimed an estimated 90 percent of a bighorn herd in eastern Nevada.

"We are committed to restoring the sheep populations in these mountain
ranges, but only after we have a reasonable assurance that the risks
of this type of disease outbreak in the future are understood and
minimized," Bertold wrote.

Officials hope to take steps to minimize chances of future problems,
Healy said. "We're going to learn from this and move forward," he
said.

[This has been an ongoing problem, as the article indicates. It is
very sad the animals are being lost over a bacterial disease that does
not seem to present itself for easy control, or that it is being
brought to the bighorn sheep by domestic sheep.

While reestablishing the herd was important, one wonders now if doing
more homework on interactions with domestic sheep should have occurred
