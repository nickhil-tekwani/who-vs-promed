Anti-bird flu steps more effective
----------------------------------
The number of birds and animals that fell prey to major epidemics
this year [2008] dropped to a 3-year low because of government
measures to check disease outbreaks, a senior Agriculture Ministry
official said Wednesday [24 Dec 2008].

The number of birds infected with avian flu dropped by 60 percent,
with 9000 birds falling prey to the virus, said Li Jinxiang, director
of the ministry's veterinary bureau.

"We've paid greater attention to animal epidemic control this year
[2008], enforcing effective vaccination programs and surveillance,"
Li said.

A general nationwide survey shows the free inoculation program for
poultry and livestock covered 95 percent of the country's villages
and towns, Li said.

Ministry of Agriculture official: total of 6 outbreaks of avian
influenza this year [2008]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Li Jinxiang, director of the Ministry of Agriculture's Veterinary
Medicine Bureau, announced on 24 Dec 2008 that there were a total of
6 outbreaks of avian influenza in China in 2008, a significant
decline from previous years. Li Jinxiang also predicted that there
would not be a large-scale outbreak of avian influenza this winter or
spring [2008-09]. He also emphasized that recent surveillance tests
showing etiologically positive samples for H5N1 from layers in
Jiangsu's Haian County and Dongtai City are not an outbreak and China
has taken required [steps to] handle....

Referring to the matter of avian influenza in 2 parts of Jiangsu
Province, Li Jinxiang said that the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed
on 16 Dec 2008 that "on 15 Dec 2008 [the Ministry of Agriculture]
received a report from Jiangsu Province veterinary agencies that when
conducting routine surveillance of poultry, samples etiologically
positive for H5N1 were detected in layers on a few farms in Haian
County and Dongtai City." The news attracted major attention within
China and abroad.

However, etiologically positive samples for avian influenza were only
found in healthy live poultry in Haian County and Dongtai City, and
avian influenza virus was not found in dead poultry. As a result, and
in accordance with relevant regulations, "this episode does not
constitute an outbreak of avian influenza."

[A clarification to the term "etiologically positive," which,
according to the statement above, "does not constitute an outbreak of
avian influenza" is pending. Contrary to the said statement, on 19
Dec 2008 China submitted to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal
Health) an official notification of 2 laboratory confirmed HPAI H5N1
outbreaks in Jiangsu Province; both have been diagnosed by an OIE
reference laboratory (see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7623>).

One cannot escape some discrepancies between recent statements on
avian influenza, as distributed in the (mainland) Chinese press, and
information elsewhere. Such a discrepancy involved a recent Chinese
press release, which stated that the H5N1 virus clade, currently
circulating in Jiangsu, had never infected humans -- a statement
found inaccurate (see ProMED-mail posting 20081222.4031 and its
correction in posting 20081224.4053). - Mod.AS]
