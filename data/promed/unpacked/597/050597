As of 18 Dec 2012, the county doctor of Ringerike County, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and hotel officials from Klekken hotel were still investigating the outbreak associated with cases of gastroenteritis in Buskerud, Norway, that occurred between 5 and 9 Dec 2012.

An estimated 170 cases were initially reported, but on Sun 16 Dec 2012 the number of cases was adjusted to 319, 6 of whom have been hospitalised. The county doctor noted that symptoms caused by norovirus infection usually resolve 2 to 3 days post-infection, but that during this outbreak a number of patients have remained symptomatic for more than a week following the initial reports of disease.

Epidemiological survey methods indicate that the nature of this outbreak is food/waterborne, but that the source remains unknown. Analyses are under way, however, officials have noted that potential sources of contamination may already have been discarded and/or consumed.

[ProMED-mail thanks Joanne Ocampo for providing further information concerning this large outbreak of undiagnosed gastroenteritis in a Norwegian hotel. Since the initial report of this outbreak the number of cases has increased from 170 to 319, with 6 affected patients now hospitalised. The preliminary conclusion that this outbreak of gastroenteritis is a result of norovirus infection now seems less likely since some patients have remained symptomatic for more than a week. The results of diagnostic tests are pending. - Mod.CP
