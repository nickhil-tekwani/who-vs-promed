The 9-year-old boy diagnosed with human rabies died at dawn this Monday [12 Mar 2012], while interned at the Sao Vicente de Paulo Maternity Hospital, in Barbalha, in the interior of Ceara state. According to information from the hospital, the death occurred at 05:40 hrs after a loss of blood pressure and cardiorespiratory arrest.

The boy, who was interned since last week [week of 5 Mar 2012] in Barbalha, had been diagnosed officially by the 2 tests that were made, one in Ceara by the Central Laboratory (LACEN) as well as a test done in Sao Paulo. The initial diagnosis was announced on Wednesday afternoon [7 Mar 2012] by LACEN.

On Friday [9 Mar 2012], the Ministry of Health had released the last drug [3rd] of the Recife [Milwaukee] protocol, for the treatment indicated for human rabies cases by the Ministry, which in 2009, managed to save the life of an adolescent in the Oswaldo Cruz Hospital in Recife.

"We did everything that was within our power," stated Ernani de Freitas, Director of the Sao Vicente de Paulo Hospital. On Friday, the physician attending the case had initiated a conversation with the American physician who created the Recife protocol [based on the previously established Milwaukee protocol used for the surviving rabies case in Milwaukee, Wisconsin USA), see 2008 ProMED archive at end. - Mod.TY].

The boy was bitten by a marmoset [tamarin monkey] on 3 Feb [2012] while playing with the animal in the Jaiti municipality, 524 km [326 mi] from Recife. Medical attention only began 15 days later, when the boy presented with the 1st symptoms -- fever and vomiting. Initially, the diagnosis was meningitis, but due to his restless behavior and the information that he not had used the medical system after the bite, the clinical picture had become possible for human rabies.

The confirmation came only about a month later when, admitted to hospital, material was collected for laboratory tests.

[Besides the tragedy itself, the focus in relation to this case was mainly a question of the Recife protocol that, for now, figures from a therapeutic perspective as heroic when it comes to rabies.

However, the occurrence of the case should raise other issues, equally or more important than the treatment in its current context, [including]:

- the necessity to provide the population, especially those individuals who reside in or are exposed to areas or situations of risk, information about rabies, and the availability and necessity of prophylactic pre- and post-exposure.

- the necessity to train health professionals to suspect, report, do tests in the laboratory, and know about the existence of a protocol for rabies treatment.

- the structuring of surveillance (including a post-mortem examination component) for viral (meningo) encephalitis, with the inclusion of rabies as a harm to be investigated. - Mod.RNA]

[Unfortunately, the boy did not receive timely post-exposure treatment, and came to hospital when clinical symptoms were well advanced, perhaps too late for successful application of the Recife/Milwaukee protocol. Thorough washing of the bite wound at the time it occurred, followed immediately by administration of rabies-immune globulin and vaccine would likely have saved his life. Also, we do not know the site of the bite. If on the hand or face, sites rich in nerve endings, progression of the infection would have been faster than at other sites. The 15-day period from bite to the 1st symptoms in this case is rapid.

An alert ProMED-mail reader noted a translation error in the previous post of this case (ProMED-mail archive no. 20120310.1066763], pointing out that the original reported Fonseca as saying that "only one [sic] of the drugs that is part of the Recife protocol has not yet been provided."
