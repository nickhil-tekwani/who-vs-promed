Drug illness "a health disaster"
----------------------------------
A mystery illness which has claimed the lives of eight drug addicts in
Scotland has been described as a "major public health disaster" by a
government drugs expert. The majority of victims have been women. Dr Tom
Gilhooley, an adviser to the Scottish Executive, has warned that unless the
cause of the illness can be established quickly, more lives are likely to
be lost. He was speaking as health officials in Glasgow revealed that a
further two heroin addicts have died, bringing the death toll to eight in
11 days.
Greater Glasgow Health Board said that the total number of people infected
has risen to 19 from 13 on Tuesday and seven of the eight people who died
were women. Experts have been unable to establish the source [sic, cause]
of the illness, which has started as an abscess or inflammation around the
point of injection.
A rogue batch of heroin or the use of citric acid to dissolve heroin have
been pinpointed as possible causes. The acid is widely available for use as
a food flavouring. But initial tests on a batch of citric acid had failed
to reveal any obvious signs of toxicity. Shopkeepers in Govanhill told BBC
Scotland that addicts frequently requested citric acid. One said: "They
come often but we always refuse and we have no citric acid."
Dr Gilhooley, who is also a Glasgow GP [general practitioner], said that,
because the majority of heroin addicts injected the drug, the death toll
could rise quickly. He said: "I'm very afraid to say the danger of more
deaths is very great. We don't have the information to put on the grapevine
to say just exactly what the cause of these deaths is. It's very difficult
to contain this, this is a major public health disaster and we have to try
and act."
Thirteen cases of the illness came to light on Tuesday and were centred on
the Govanhill area in the south of the city. But the health board said six
more cases had been reported in the north of the city and of these four of
the victims were female and two were male. All the victims had injected
into muscles or other tissue rather than veins, a practice most common
among female addicts, and one possible indicator of why more women had
fallen ill.
A board spokesman said: "As with the earlier cases, all have a serious
abscess as a result of injecting into muscle or accidentally injecting
outside a vein. Four of the patients are in a stable condition but two
women have died." There are now therefore 19 known cases of whom 14 are
women and five men."
The board said that it had issued a Glasgow-wide warning to GPs treating
people with drug problems about the illness and they have come forward to
report more cases. Health officials said the illness usually began with the
appearance of an abscess or inflammation and this was followed by breathing
problems and organ failure. The officials said there was no evidence that
the illness could be transmitted from one person to another and there was
no wider risk to the community.
Public health consultant, Dr Laurence Gruer, said: "Drug injectors are
advised to seek urgent medical attention if they develop a serious abscess
or severe tissue inflammation and to avoid injecting into muscle if at all
possible."
Of the initial 13 cases initially reported, three people were said to be
seriously ill in hospital and a further four had been released after
receiving treatment.

[This was first reported by the BBC on 9th May; I have been unable to find
any other accounts, eg major British newspapers' websites. On Tuesday Dr
Laurence Gruer, a Public Health consultant, was quoted as saying that there
had been no evident physical contact between any of the Govanhill victims.
Obviously we would appreciate any informed comment on this outbreak of
deaths among heroin addicts injecting themselves intramuscularly. Any
attempt at remote diagnosis would be rank speculation with this little
information, whatever one's personal suspicions. - Mod. MHJ]
