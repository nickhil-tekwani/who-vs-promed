Sudan has announced its 1st poultry infections with avian flu and is
monitoring a suspected human case, Agence France-Presse (AFP)
reported today [18 Apr 2006].
More than 100 000 chickens on 15 farms near Khartoum have been
exterminated, Mustafa Hassan, a Ministry of Animal Resources
official, told AFP today [18 Apr 2006]. Suspected cases of avian flu
in poultry have been reported in several Sudanese newspapers, AFP
reported. But today's confirmation was the 1st official
acknowledgement of the situation.
Hassan said the owner of a poultry farm near Khartoum had been
hospitalized with suspected avian flu, and Health Minister Tabita
Butros Shokaya later said the man had tested positive, AFP reported.
However, John Jabbour, a WHO regional health regulation officer,
today [18 Apr 2006] confirmed cases of H5N1 in poultry in Sudan but
did not confirm any human cases, AFP reported. He added that a WHO
team and representatives from the US Navy laboratory in Cairo were
leaving Cairo today to begin assessing the situation in Sudan.
The infected chickens were found at 2 farms in Khartoum and Jazeera
provinces. The man suspected of having avian flu owns one of the
farms, Reuters reported.
Sudan shares its long northern border with Egypt. Egypt is one of a
handful of African countries to have confirmed the H5N1 virus in
poultry and the only one with human cases confirmed to date. Other
African countries that have had outbreaks in poultry are Nigeria,
Niger, Cameroon, and Burkina Faso.
In addition to its proximity to at least one avian flu-affected
country, Sudan faces a number of internal problems that could
complicate response to H5N1. Infectious diseases still pose a major
concern in Sudan. In less than 2 years, WHO has noted, Sudanese
experienced Ebola, shigellosis, hepatitis E, meningococcal disease,
yellow fever, and cholera. The overall life expectancy at birth is
58.9 years, according to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Factbook online.
Sudan is also in the midst of a complex emergency in the western
region of Darfur. About 200 000 people have died, and nearly 2
million are displaced, according to the CIA. In addition, refugees
have flocked from Ethiopia and Chad to Sudan. Armed conflict,
transportation woes, and other hurdles have hindered humanitarian assistance.
