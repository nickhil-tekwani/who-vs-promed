Yesterday 16 people were treated in hospital, including a 9 year old who
died, after mistakenly eating globefish yesterday in southern Binh Thuan
province's Ham Thuan Bac district. The group manifested nausea and fainting
upon arrival at the province's general hospital. Of the stricken, 3 have
been released while 12 remain in hospital.
Initial investigations showed the fish were not prepared carefully, leaving
its natural poison or tetrodotoxin to be consumed. There have been several
occurrences of food poisoning from ingesting globefish in the province in
past years.

[The puffer fish, also called blow fish, swell fish, globe fish, or balloon
fish, is named for the ability to inflate to several times normal size by
swallowing water or air when threatened.
The eyes and internal organs of most puffer fish are highly toxic due to the
presence of tetrodotoxin, but nevertheless its meat is considered a delicacy
in Japan and Korea. The name "fugu" is used both for the fish that are eaten
and for their meat. The Korean term for this fish is "boh-guh."
The diagnosis of any food poisoning is much easier, as here, when one sees a
cluster of patients with similar acute symptoms after a shared meal.
Tetrodotoxin's mode of action is a selective blockade of voltage-gated
sodium channels of nerves and muscles causing an illness described below.
Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) caused by ingestion of the
dinoflagellate-produced saxitoxin produces almost identical symptoms, as the
mode of action of the toxin is the same, although the moderate to severe
hypotension in puffer fish is not usually seen in PSP (1).
Anticholinesterase pesticide poisoning can be mistaken for puffer fish or
PSP-induced disease but can be alleviated by use of atropine and is
accompanied by other evidence of cholinergic nervous system stimulation such
as excess salivation, tearing and bronchial secretion, and constriction of
the pupils of the eye.
Treatment of both tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin-induced disease is basically
supportive with assisted ventilation after charcoal has been given to
decrease the amount of toxin absorbed. 4-aminopyridine (also known as 4-AP
and Fampridine) is a drug that blocks the potassium channels in neurons.
Agriculturally, 4-AP is used as an extremely effective bird poison sold
under the brand name Avitrol. The effect of 4-AP can effectively reverse the
effect of the toxins at least in animal models (2,3) if used at the time of
respiratory muscle paralysis. It is unclear if this methodology has been
used in humans.
The following was extracted from the "Bad Bug Book"
<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap39.html>:
....Fish poisoning by consumption of members of the order Tetraodontiformes
is one of the most violent intoxications from marine species. The gonads,
liver, intestines, and skin of pufferfish can contain levels of tetrodotoxin
sufficient to produce rapid and violent death. The flesh of many pufferfish
may not usually be dangerously toxic.
Tetrodotoxin has also been isolated from widely differing animal species,
including the California newt, parrotfish, frogs of the genus Atelopus, the
blue-ringed octopus, starfish, angelfish, and xanthid crabs. The metabolic
source of tetrodotoxin is uncertain. No algal source has been identified,
and until recently tetrodotoxin was assumed to be a metabolic product of the
host. However, recent reports of the production of
tetrodotoxin/anhydrotetrodotoxin by several bacterial species, including
strains of the family _Vibrionaceae_, _Pseudomonas sp._, and _Photobacterium
phosphoreum_ point toward a bacterial origin of this family of toxins. These
are relatively common marine bacteria that are often associated with marine
animals. If confirmed, these findings may have some significance in
toxicoses that have been more directly related to these bacterial species.
The first symptom of intoxication is a slight numbness of the lips and
tongue, appearing between 20 minutes to 3 hours after eating poisonous
pufferfish. The next symptom is increasing paresthesia in the face and
extremities, which may be followed by sensations of lightness or floating.
Headache, epigastric pain, nausea, diarrhea, and/or vomiting may occur.
Occasionally, some reeling or difficulty in walking may occur. The 2nd stage
of the intoxication is increasing paralysis. Many victims are unable to
move; even sitting may be difficult. There is increasing respiratory
distress. Speech is affected, and the victim usually exhibits dyspnea,
cyanosis, and hypotension. Paralysis increases and convulsions, mental
impairment, and cardiac arrhythmia may occur.
The victim, although completely paralyzed, may be conscious and in some
cases completely lucid until shortly before death. Death usually occurs
within 4 to 6 hours, with a known range of about 20 minutes to 8 hours....
