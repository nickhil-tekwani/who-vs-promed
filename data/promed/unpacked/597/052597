[An outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Hawke's Bay is alarming health
officials.
Sixty-seven cases have been reported this year compared with eight at the
same time last year.
Healthcare Hawke's Bay medical officer of health, Caroline McElnay, said 12
cases had been reported for October compared with three in August and nine
in September.
Health officials blamed the time of year and children feeding animals for
the outbreak. The disease, which caused "bloody diarrhoea" and terrible
stomach pain, left people feeling generally unwell, Dr McElnay said.
Most of the cases since September were young people under 15, but people of
all ages could be affected.
"At this time of year, children could become infected after handling pet
lambs and calves, as animals often carried cryptosporidium cysts in their
faeces," Dr McElnay said.
The disease was easily spread, so it was essential that people preparing
food washed their hands thoroughly, she said.
"People who have diarrhoea must stay out of the kitchen."
In past outbreaks, public swimming pools had been targeted as potential
carriers of the cryptosporidium cysts. There was no evidence that this had
happened this time, as most of the cases appeared to be unrelated, Dr
McElnay said.
People who have had diarrhoea should not swim in a public pool until two
weeks after having diarrhoea.
Dr McElnay urged people with symptoms to see a doctor so the public health
unit could isolate the cause to stop it spreading.
