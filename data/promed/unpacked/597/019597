A case of potato brown rot has been confirmed in the Irish Republic
for the 1st time, sparking a major alert across the industry. The
disease, which has been termed the foot-and-mouth of the potato
sector, has been identified on a farm in the south-east of the
country. Supplies have been recalled and the movement of all stocks
halted as an army of inspectors from the department of agriculture
tries to trace the source of the infection.

Brown rot poses no risk to animal or human health but is highly
infectious and, if allowed to spread, could have devastating
consequences for the BPS 56 million (USD 114.65 million) Irish
industry and its 700-plus growers. It could also affect the
previously high-grade status enjoyed by Irish seed exports.

The usual source of the disease is infected seed or water. In this
case, the disease was initially detected in water samples taken at a
potato packing premises as part of the department's routine control
programme. It was then traced back to a substantial player in the
Irish industry, which also supplies seed. These supplies have been
recalled for testing and the movement of all stocks on the farm and
at packhouses halted, in a bid to prevent the disease spreading.
Extensive sampling is being carried out at the farm by department
inspectors, but so far the source of the infection has not been identified.

Growers across the republic have been put on alert by the department,
and urged to report any signs or suspicions of the disease. "We are
working closely with the industry to ensure the outbreak is brought
under control as quickly as possible," said a spokesman.

Brown rot is caused by a bacterium called _Ralstonia solanacearum_.
Plants start to wilt shortly after infection, stems become
discoloured, and the plants eventually die. Potatoes that are
affected have a sticky ooze on the eyes and heel of the tuber.

Detection of the disease and the current alert could scarcely have
been more ill-timed. Horticulture minister Trevor Sargent has just
announced a grant aid programme to develop "a vibrant potato seed
sector," which he said is critical for the future of the industry.
Funding of around BPS 1.4 m (USD 2.87 m) is aimed at improving the
production and marketing infrastructure through investment.

[Brown rot of potato caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ is widely
distributed in warm temperate areas. Symptoms include wilting of
plants and brown internal staining of tubers. Symptom expression is
favoured by temperatures above 15 deg C (59 deg F). The bacteria may
also latently infect tubers without causing symptoms and can survive
in seed tubers during storage to cause disease when planted in the
next season. The pathogen is spread by mechanical means and insects,
contaminated equipment, infected plant material (including seed
potatoes), and contaminated water (for example in waterlogged fields
or drainage channels). Solanaceous and other weeds and unharvested
potato plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs.

Yield losses are mostly caused by tuber rotting and, in many warmer
areas of the world, brown rot is one of the main limiting factors in
potato production. The effect on food- and seed-potato industries can
be substantial, and tomato crops are also susceptible. Within the
European Community there have been sporadic findings in many member
states. The European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO) has
included the pathogen in its quarantine list.

_R. solanacearum_ invades the roots of diverse plant hosts from the
soil and aggressively colonises the xylem vessels causing lethal
wilting diseases. It was 1st reported as the cause of wilt diseases
at the end of the 19th century and is a widely distributed,
economically important plant pathogen. It exists as several races
affecting more than 200 plant species including major crops such as
banana, peanut, potato, tomato, and other solanaceous vegetables. In
Europe, race 3 is present and spreading. Races 1 and 2 occur
worldwide in tropical climates, with race 2 causing the devastating
Moko disease of banana. There are a number of further races of lower
economical significance.
