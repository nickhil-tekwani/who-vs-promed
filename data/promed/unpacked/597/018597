Artificial cows fool disease-spreading tsetse fly
---------------------------------------------------
A cattle disease spread by the tsetse fly has almost vanished from Zimbabwe
thanks to the introduction of artificial cows.
The [artificial cows are just screens or traps that have been baited with
a manufactured version of the smell cattle give off, but they are also
covered in insecticide which kills the confused flies in huge numbers.
The tsetse fly spreads deadly sickness in humans and the equivalent
disease, called nagana, in cattle. Before artificial cows were introduced,
Zimbabwe spread up to 200 tons of DDT, a pesticide now banned in many
countries, every year. But nagana is now almost absent from the country
with only 4 of the 'cows' needed to protect each square kilometre of pasture.
The system was developed by the University of Greenwich with funding from
the Department for International Development and the EU. The university's
Dr Stephen Torr thinks it could be used elsewhere in Africa to
"significantly reduce cases of nagana."
He added: "In total around 2900 tons of DDT have been used in Zimbabwe.
This pest control policy has now been abandoned in favour of more effective
and environmentally friendly alternatives such as artificial cows."

[Traps for tsetse control have been developed for some years with good
results. The emergence of trypanosomiasis in several African countries show
that cheap and effective methods for control are badly needed. - Mod.EP
