Cows in Ishikawa not infected with foot-and-mouth disease
---------------------------------------------------------
Cows in Japan's Ishikawa Prefecture that showed FMD-like symptoms
tested negative for the contagious viral ailment in a genetic test,
the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said on Saturday.

The Ishikawa government reported to the farm ministry on Friday [11
Feb 2011] that what looked like blisters had been found on the tongues
of 15 cows at a paddock in the town of Shika in the central Japan
prefecture, raising suspicion of infection with the disease.

Although the ministry saw a low likelihood of infection, it asked the
National Institute of Animal Health's office in Tokyo to conduct
genetic testing, in view of the recent FMD outbreak in South Korea. If
infection had been confirmed, it would have been the 1st case of FMD
in Japan since the outbreak in Miyazaki Prefecture last July [2010].

The latest suspicion followed the announcement earlier this month
that Japan has been declared free of the contagious livestock disease
by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

[Japan regained its "FMD free Member without vaccination status" on 4
Feb 2011. The full text of the decision is available at

The alertness of the veterinary authorities and their swift handling
of the event are commendable. It will be interesting to note if the
etiology of the mouth lesions, observed in the suspected dairy farm,
has been eventually determined. - Mod.AS]
