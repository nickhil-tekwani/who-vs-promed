Public Health England (PHE) is investigating a spike in reports of [enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC)] infections this month [August 2020]. Potential sources of the increase in _E. coli_ O157 cases are not yet clear, but recent warm weather may have played a role.

The latest available data show in the week ending 16 Aug 2020, there were 27 _E. coli_ O157 notifications. The past 4 weeks had seen 11, 13, 6, and 7, respectively. Based on 2019 statistics for the week ending 18 Aug 2019, there were 13 _E. coli_ O157 notifications. The previous 4 weeks had 3 weeks with 12 and one week with 14.

"Since the beginning of August 2020, PHE has noted a general increase in reports of _E. coli_ O157 infections, in particular in the West and East Midlands," said a PHE statement sent to Food Safety News. "An increase in _E. coli_ activity at this time of year is not unusual, especially given recent climatic conditions. Public Health England is actively investigating this situation. A possible source of these outbreaks remains unclear at this point in time."

Some services at the gastrointestinal bacteria reference unit (GBRU), which is part of PHE, have been suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, detection of EHEC from stool specimens and isolates using PCR and confirmation of identity and typing of _Salmonella, _Shigella_, EHEC and _Listeria_ using whole genome sequencing are continuing.

Symptoms of _E. coli_ infection include abdominal cramps and diarrhea that can become bloody. Fever and vomiting may also occur. The incubation period can range from 3 to 8 days, and most patients recover within 10 days.

HUS [hemolytic uremic syndrome] is a serious condition that can lead to kidney failure, permanent health problems, and even death. It is most often triggered by EHEC infection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Early symptoms include decreased urine output, diarrhea, and feeling slow and tired. HUS usually develops 1 to 2 weeks after initial symptoms of _E. coli_ infection.

_E. coli_ is transmitted to humans primarily through consumption of contaminated food, such as raw or undercooked ground meat, raw milk, and raw vegetables and sprouts. "_E. coli_ can cause a serious infection in those with weakened immune systems or vulnerable groups, including babies, the elderly or pregnant women," according to PHE.

"Some infections can be severe, and people who are infected may go on to develop complications which may be life-threatening. As with all instances of diarrhea and vomiting, it is important that people keep hydrated and stay away from work or school for as long as symptoms persist. If you do notice blood in your stool, contact your GP immediately."
