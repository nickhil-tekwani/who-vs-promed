A Gallatin County woman has died of hantavirus, the Gallatin
City-County Health Department said Wednesday [24 Jan 2007]
The department is investigating how and where the 43-year-old woman
contracted the disease, also called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
The woman's name was not released. She died about a week and a half
ago, said Stephanie Murphy, the agency's human services director.
People get hantavirus by inhaling airborne particles from dried
droppings, saliva or urine of infected deer mice [_Peromyscus
maniculatus_], the department said. Symptoms may include fever,
vomiting, muscle and body aches and fatigue. A person's lungs
eventually begin filling with fluid, causing shortness of breath.
The disease is named after the Hantaan River in South Korea, where it
was first identified.
In Montana, hantavirus is "relatively uncommon, considering the
amount of potential exposures that occur daily all around the state,"
said Elton Mosher, disease surveillance specialist with the state
Department of Public Health and Human Services. "We see only one or 2
cases each year in this state."
Across the state, 27 people have been diagnosed with hantavirus, and
7 have died since the disease was first recognized in 1993.
The woman's illness is the second case in Gallatin County but the
first resulting in death. A nonfatal case was reported in 2001.
