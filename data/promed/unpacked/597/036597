No new cases of cholera have been identified since at least 4 people were announced to have the illness last week [week ending 25 Mar 2018], with all infections tied to eating herring eggs.

Dr. Shannon Waters, a medical health officer with Island Health, said the number of cases is still being tabulated because testing is not yet complete. "It's evolving," she said. "We're waiting for the results. We are less than 5 cases."

Waters said the emergence of cholera is a rare situation in BC. "We have not seen instances of _Vibrio cholera_ infection within the province before," she said. "This originally came to our attention through stool cultures that came through the lab system that came positive for _Vibrio cholerae_. When contacting patients to find out what was going on with this we found out a common link of eating herring eggs."

Island Health and the First Nations Health Authority responded with a joint warning against the consumption of herring eggs. They advised that no one eat herring eggs found from French Creek to Qualicum Bay -- the only area implicated. It is now subject to a Department of Fisheries closure to herring-egg harvest. The 2 health agencies and the BC Centre for Disease Control are all involved in examining the cholera outbreak.

"It's a traditional First Nations fishery," Waters said of herring eggs. "A number of people do eat them raw, some people do eat them cooked. There's different ways of eating them." Waters said that Island Health has been working particularly with the First Nations Health Authority and First Nations communities in the wake of the illnesses.

She said initial test results show only that the health system is dealing with _Vibrio cholera_ bacteria, but those involved want to learn more. "We don't know what type we have yet," she said. "That will give us further information that will help us figure out what might be behind this."

The effort is widespread. "We're working with our national partners and our provincial partners, so those results are at the national microbiology laboratory," she said. "We hope that in the coming days we'll know that further information. We're also doing marine water-sample testing and testing of the eggs."

[It remains likely that the strains are non-O1, non-O139 types.

As a review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _Vibrio cholerae_ are shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serogroups. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are non-virulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is "non-O1"), a single serogroup, designated O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 serotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima, each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype (or biotype). The biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C; and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare.

In almost all cases, non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_ isolates do not possess the genes for cholera toxin as the non-toxigenic O1 in this posting. Some isolates can cause substantial diarrhea (1-4). The type III secretion system (TTSS) is a mechanism for Gram negative bacilli to introduce effector proteins into host cell cytoplasm (5). It has been reported that a functional TTSS is required for at least in some non-O1, non-O139 isolates to induce diarrhea in an animal model associated with small bowel damage and production of proinflammatory cytokines (6). In addition, TTSS contributes to virulence even in the presence of cholera toxin and TCP (6).

Every spring (http://www.pacificherring.org/explorer/life-cycle/eggs), adult herring congregate in huge numbers to spawn along coastal shores. Between February and April, depending on the location, the females lay their sticky eggs on seaweed, sea grass, or rough rocks. On average, each female herring lays 20 000 eggs. The males spread their sperm over the eggs, turning large swaths of the ocean into a characteristic turquoise blue color. A spawn event can stretch over many kilometers of shoreline. About 5285 km [approx. 3284 mi] of British Columbia's extensive coastline have been classified as herring spawning habitat. Of this, an estimated 300 to 600 km [approx. 186 to 373 mi], or about 1.8 per cent of BC's total shoreline length, is intensively utilized by herring spawners in a typical season. Unlike salmon, herring do not die after spawning, and they spawn every year. The eggs can be seen in a picture at the above URL.

British Columbia is the westernmost province of Canada, located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains. With an estimated population of 4.8 million as of 2017, it is Canada's 3rd-most populous province. It can be seen on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia. - Mod.LL]
