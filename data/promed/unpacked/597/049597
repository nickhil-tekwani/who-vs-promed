The Official Veterinary Services of Andalusia, for the 1st time in 4 years, have detected the circulation of serotype 4 of the virus of the disease known as bluetongue in 2 livestock farms in the province of Huelva: the 1st in a sentinel goat in El Granado, within the National Bluetongue Surveillance Program implemented in Spain, and the 2nd in a sheep farm in the municipality of Rosal de la Frontera, where the sheep that were positive had previously presented symptoms compatible with the disease.

In both cases, the farms are located a few kilometers from the border with Portugal, whose authorities have reported the suspicion of 3 outbreaks in the municipality of Serpa, which they will foreseeably confirm in the coming days.

The animals in both cases have tested positive for serotype 4 of the bluetongue virus by PCR, the results having been confirmed by the Central Veterinary Laboratory of Algete, the national reference laboratory for the disease in Spain.

The municipality of Rosal de la Frontera is located within the region of Cortegana, which was currently a disease-free zone, although the veterinary authorities have extended the restriction zone to the region of Cortegana and the following municipalities in the region of Jerez of the Knights in the province of Badajoz: Valencia de Mombuey, Oliva de la Frontera, and Villanueva del Fresno.

Currently, prevention, surveillance, and control measures are being strengthened in the area, and vaccination against serotype 4 of the bluetongue virus will be required for all sheep over 3 months of age.

Restrictions have also been established on the movements of animals of species sensitive to the disease, and passive surveillance has been reinforced, recalling the obligation to report any suspicion, as well as the disinfection of farms.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for his submission.

According to the most recent (1 Jul 2021) updated EU map presenting the BT disease status in the member countries, most of Spain's territory is regarded as BTV-free, excluding 3 "BT zones": Andalusia (coloured blue, which means the circulation of, or vaccination against, BTV serotypes 1 and 4); the western Pyrenees (coloured green, BTV serotype 8), and the Balearic Islands (coloured orange, BTV serotype 4).

The movement of domestic ruminants from and into the BT zones is regulated/restricted according to the BT status and serotypes in the relevant zones. The map is available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/system/files/2021-07/ad_control-measures_bt_restrictedzones-map.pdf. - Mod.AS
