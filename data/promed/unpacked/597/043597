Localities across the country have detected a total 135 measles patients and 3 meningococcal meningitis cases.

The Health Ministry of Vietnam has warned the people of the possibility of infectious disease break in the summer. The Ministry of Health's Preventive Medicine Department said that this year [2018] the country has recorded around 15 000 dengue cases, which is down by 37.7 percent on-year.

While a total number of nearly 7000 hand, foot and mouth disease cases have been reported nationwide. Localities across the country have detected a total 135 measles patients and 3 meningococcal meningitis cases.

Hanoi alone has found 81 dengue fever cases, 234 hand, foot and mouth disease cases, 61 measles cases and 2 meningococcal meningitis cases. While in March [2018], Hanoi had 20--25 hand, foot and mouth disease patients on average per week. By late April [2018], the figure grew to 50--70 cases.

The Deputy Head of Vietnam National Hospital of Paediatrics' Infectious Disease Ward, Do Thein Hai said that there were no foot, hand, and mouth disease vaccines prepared, so it would be easy for patients to face serious complications which could lead to fatalities.

Dr. Truong Dinh Bac, Deputy Head of Preventive Medicine Department said that many respiratory and digestive diseases also have a high risk for a breakout. People need to take preventive measures against these diseases.

[7] Japan (Okinawa) ex Taiwan

Measles cases are spreading in Okinawa, with the reported number of patients exceeding 90 in just over a month, prompting the prefecture last month [April 2018] to warn that visiting the resort islands may be not advisable for infants and pregnant women.

The measles outbreak is believed to have started when a Taiwanese man was diagnosed with the viral disease on [20 Mar 2018] while visiting the prefecture. It had quickly grown from that single measles case to 91 cases as of [Thu 3 May 2018], according to the Okinawa Prefectural Government. One case has been reported on a U.S. military base in the prefecture.

The outbreak has now reached Aichi Prefecture, after a local teenager was diagnosed with measles following a trip to Okinawa last month [April 2018]. A total of 17 measles cases were reported by [Sat 5 May 2018], including 12 people who happened to be at a hospital when the teenager visited, according to the Aichi Prefectural Government.

Here are some questions and answers about the viral disease and the recent outbreak. ...

Why did the outbreak occur in Okinawa?
--------------------------------------
The measles virus is believed to have been carried by a Taiwanese man in his 30s who visited Okinawa in March [2018]. Dozens of local people who had contact with the man or visited the same facilities contracted the disease. The virus is believed to have spread to others via those patients.

Prefectural data shows that most patients are under the age of 50, and many cannot recall if they've had a single vaccination, or whether they've ever had one.

Given the outbreak, more than 3500 people -- including 421 Taiwanese, 194 Hong Kong citizens and 6 Chinese -- had canceled their trip to Okinawa by [Wed 2 May 2018], according to the prefecture. ...

In 1978, the government launched a measles vaccination program for preschoolers offering free vaccinations. But as a single vaccination was found to be insufficient for some to acquire immunity, the government changed the program in 2006 so that children receive 2 shots.

Wasn't Japan declared free of measles by the World Health Organization?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, in 2015. The declaration was based on a 3-year span during which no infections originating from within the nation were reported.

But Japan has continued to see measles cases coming from overseas. In recent years, for example, measles made headlines in 2016, when 33 people working at Kansai International Airport were found to have contracted the disease. The outbreak is believed to have started from a Japanese national who arrived at the airport after a trip to China, according to the NIID. Last year [2017], the infection of one man during a stay in Indonesia also resulted in more than 50 cases of measles.

But overall, the number of measles cases in Japan has dropped sharply from roughly 11 000 in 2008 to 189 in 2017.

What's the situation in other countries?
----------------------------------------
The number of reported measles cases has been low in recent years in the United States and some Middle East countries that have vaccination programs, according to the health ministry. The highly contagious disease, however, is still common in Asia and Africa, especially in India, China, Pakistan and Nigeria, according to the WHO.

Between March 2017 and February [2018], 51 626 people in India became infected with the disease, followed by 10 391 in Nigeria, 7790 in Indonesia and 7758 in Ukraine, WHO data show.

European countries also saw measles outbreaks last year [2017], with Italy, Ukraine and Romania topping the list with several thousand cases reported in each.

Health authorities in WA [West Australia] have issued a new measles alert, for people who travelled on a Qantas domestic flight from Adelaide to Perth. The WA Health Department said passengers on Qantas flight QF585 from Adelaide to Perth last [Sat 5 May 2018] should be alert to an increased risk of measles. The flight left Adelaide around 2pm and arrived in Perth about 3:55 pm.

A young child who was on the flight has subsequently been confirmed to have measles, and would have been infectious to others on the plane. ...

There have now been 10 measles cases confirmed in Perth residents since mid-March [2018], including 4 adults, 5 infants too young for vaccination, and 1 teenager.

WA Health medical epidemiologist Gary Dowse said that 8 of the 10 cases were infected while travelling overseas. The imported cases have been infected in Bali, Thailand, India, Malaysia and Afghanistan.

"With high vaccination coverage, naturally occurring measles has been eliminated from WA for around 20 years but occasional cases and small outbreaks still occur - associated with tourists or WA residents who are infected overseas," Dr Dowse said.

Cases of measles have rocketed on Merseyside - with 3 times as many reports since the start of 2018 compared with last year [2017]. There have been 40 suspected cases of measles reported on Merseyside since the start of the year, according to Public Health England. This makes the reported number of cases 3.1 times higher than the 13 cases reported over the same period in 2017 and in 2016.

Among areas of Merseyside, Liverpool saw the highest number of reports in the first 17 weeks of the year [2018], with 15 - up from 4 in the same period in 2017. It was followed by Knowsley with 10 cases, up from 1, with 9 cases in Sefton, 5 in Wirral , and 1 in St Helens.

Across England and Wales 1022 suspected cases were reported to Public Health England - a much higher number than over the same period in recent years.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has reported a high risk of measles in Europe, with cases being imported and exported between countries.

This is largely due to lower MMR vaccine uptake in many European countries. Romania, Italy, Germany, Greece and France are all currently experiencing large measles outbreaks.
