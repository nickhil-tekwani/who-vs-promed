Summary:
Report type: follow-up report no 4
Date of start of the event: 18 Aug 2013
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 14 Aug 2013
Report date: 5 Sep 2013
Date submitted to OIE: 5 Sep 2013
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H7N7
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to a defined within the country

New outbreaks (2):
Outbreak 1: Mordano, Bologna, Emilia-Romagna
Date of start of the outbreak: 3 Sep 2013
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed /Slaughtered
Birds / 98 200 / 11 / 11 / 0 /
Affected population: The positivity regards a commercial layer hens farm located in the protection zone established around the 2nd outbreak in Mordano Municipality.

Outbreak 2: Bondeno, Ferrara, Emilia-Romagna
Date of start of the outbreak: 4 Sep 2013
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed /Slaughtered
Birds / 3 / 1 / 1 / 2 / 0
Affected population: the positivity regards a backyard flock of free-range hens. During last week of August [2013], 5 hens died and one of them on 1 Sep 2013 was delivered to the laboratory and resulted positive to avian influenza type A/H7 at PCR.

Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 2
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 98 203 / 12 / 12 / 2 / 0
Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 0.01 percent / 0.01 percent / 100 percent / 0.01 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the National Reference Laboratory in Padova has confirmed H7 at RT-PCR. The farm in Mordano is already located in the restriction zones and depopulation will be carried out. Restriction zones have been established around the flock in Bondeno, a protection zone of 3 km [1.8 mi] and a surveillance zone of 10 km [6.2 mi], the hens have been culled, and the epidemiological investigation is on going.

Control measures:
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: stamping out; screening; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute (IZSVe), PADOVA (national laboratory) / Birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 4 Sep 2013 / Positive
Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute (IZSVe), PADOVA (national laboratory) / Birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 5 Sep 2013 / Positive

Future reporting:
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[According to the latest information provided at the European Commission website, the EU works closely with international partners in the fight against avian influenza. Regular contact and information exchange occur between the European Commission, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Italy has notified 6 outbreaks of HPAI in the region of Emilia-Romagna since the 2nd half of August 2013. The 1st 2 outbreaks were located in poultry holdings in Ostellato (province of Ferrara) and in Mordano (province of Bologna). The 3rd outbreak occurred in Portomaggiore (also in the province of Ferrara, within the protection zone of the 1st outbreak in Ostellato) and the 4th and 5th outbreaks were detected in Mordano (within the protection zone of the 2nd outbreak). 4 industrial holdings are egg producing farms and one is dedicated to turkey farming. The 6th outbreak was reported in a backyard flock in Bondeno (province of Ferrara). Epidemiological investigations suggest that the virus entered the holding in Ostellato as a low pathogenicity strain, and it then mutated into HPAI.

In order to control virus spread, the Italian authorities are applying the measures foreseen by Council Directive 2005/94/EC, notably the killing of birds and the setting up of protection and surveillance zones around the affected areas. In these zones strict movement restrictions on poultry and poultry products apply, while specific veterinary checks are ongoing.

The Italian authorities also established a "further restricted zone" where movement restrictions and surveillance apply to commercial farms keeping laying hens, poultry breeders, and turkeys. Enhanced monitoring and biosecurity measures have also been put in place on the whole poultry sector in Italy (http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/avian/index_en.print.htm).

Further details can be found in the presentation provided by Italy on 26 Aug 2013, available at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/avian/docs/20130827-105434_hpai_h7n7_italy.pdf.

According to the WAHID summary, the total number of animals affected in the 6 outbreaks is: 952 658 susceptible, 151 863 cases, 5676 dead, and 2 destroyed (note: the 2 animals destroyed are from the 6th outbreak in Bondeno (province of Ferrara), where the total susceptible population was only 3 -- there was one death, and the remaining 2 hens were destroyed). For the other outbreaks, the number of animals that have been destroyed has not yet been communicated (for the other 5 outbreaks the reported number destroyed is indicated as "0" however, depopulation is ongoing and once completed these will be updated).

The above and additional data on this event can also be found at the WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Immsummary
(Note: to view the information on HPAI, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease).

The figure indicated for "animals destroyed" is not current as depopulation is on-going and will need to be updated by the Italian authorities during subsequent submissions to the OIE. - Mod.CRD
