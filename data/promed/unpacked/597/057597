HEGINS PIGEON SHOOT MAY SPREAD AVIAN INFLUENZA
July 3, 1997
IGC
An article examining concerns about the potential spread of Pennsylvania's
Avian Influenza epidemic that were raised in a letter to the Fund for
Animals from Dr. Gordon Stull, a veterinarian who has treated rescued birds
at the Hegins [Pennsylvania pigeon shoot for the last four years. He wrote
that the conditions of birds at the pigeon shoot were ripe for spreading
the disease to poultry or humans. According to the article, it is highly
unlikely that wild pigeons would spread the disease, but the crowded,
stressful, filthy, and emaciated conditions of the birds kept at the pigeon
shoot are ripe for harboring and spreading disease. In addition, those
birds who are not shot are released into the wild. The letter has
reportedly been forwarded to Governor Tom Ridge and to Secretary of
Agriculture Samuel Hayes.
The article goes on to say that over the last four years, Dr. Stull has
documented that birds rescued from the Hegins pigeon shoot actively carried
dangerous diseases such as Salmonella (serotype B, which is often
incriminated in human Salmonella outbreaks), Chlamydia (also known as
Psittacosis or Parrot Fever), Pigeon Avian Pox, and Paramyxovirus (group 1
variant P). It also said that at the 1996 pigeon shoot, approximately 75
percent of the rescued birds demonstrated serious pathological lesions.
Dr Stull also wrote that he believes "the Labor Day release of 5,000
pigeons (many of whom would then be incubating or manifesting the diseases
brought about by the unnatural conditions forced upon them by the lack of
proper care) into the environment would promote a health risk to
Pennsylvania."
The article said that although the Fund for Animals has in the past alerted
the Dept. of Agriculture's Bureau of Animal Industry to the fact that
Pennsylvania's Agriculture Code prohibits the importation or intrastate
movement of birds with infectious diseases (7 Pa. Code $$ 3.3 and 3.193)
without the proper permits, the Department of Agriculture has refused to
act on the information.
The article concluded by citing Heidi Prescott, National Director of The
Fund for Animals as saying "The Hegins pigeon shoot not only causes
thousands of birds to suffer, but also puts at risk the health of all
Pennsylvanians. The Schuylkill County organizers of the pigeon shoot are
acting illegally and irresponsibly by releasing diseased birds into their
community and by hiring young children to handle dead and crippled pigeons."

[This appears to be a possible mode of transmission but needs to be
substantiated by actual testing. Perhaps someone can fund testing at
the upcoming event. -- Mod MDM
