Tamiflu-resistant swine flu [influenza A (H1N1)] passed person-to-person in US
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
US researchers say they've spotted the 1st case of a Tamiflu
[oseltamivir]-resistant influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus passing
between 2 people -- raising the specter that more widespread
resistance will render the antiviral drug [oseltamivir] less useful in
combating the pandemic.

The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus is spreading rapidly, although it has
not changed from the typically mild illness observed last spring and
summer [2009], experts said at a press conference held Thursday [29
Oct 2009] at the Infectious Diseases Society of America's annual
meeting in Philadelphia. "We have the same [pandemic (H1N1) 2009]
disease from the spring and summer but just a lot more of it right
now," said Rear Admiral Dr Stephen Redd, director of the Influenza
Coordination Unit at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[CDC]. "An increasing proportion of people are visiting doctors with
influenza-like illness, the disease is widespread and we are seeing
more deaths in children in particular, and we would expect that to
continue as the number of cases increases," he said. Antiviral drugs
have been dispatched from the US government stockpile to treat
children, Redd added.

So far, almost all strains of H1N1 have responded to both oseltamivir
(Tamiflu) and another antiviral, zanamivir (Relenza), while displaying
resistance to amantadine, a drug in a different class. As a result,
Tamiflu and Relenza have been used widely for both the prevention and
treatment of H1N1. However, in June and July 2009, 65 campers and
staff at a summer camp in North Carolina became ill with H1N1 and were
treated with Tamiflu, while 600 other campers and staff took the
antiviral to prevent the illness. 2 females who shared a cabin
developed symptoms after starting on Tamiflu and were later found to
have a virus with 2 viral mutations that rendered them resistant to
the drug. The mutated virus was not found in other people tested.

What's troubling is that one of the females appears to have
transmitted the mutated virus to her cabin mate. "It is likely that
this resistant virus was passed from one camper to the other based on
the timing between the illnesses and 2 genetic mutations found in the
virus in both campers," explained Dr Natalie Janine Dailey, lead
author of the study and an epidemic intelligence service officer with
the North Carolina Division of Public Health Communicable Disease
Branch. "A small number of cases of oseltamivir-resistance have been
seen in the USA so far, but these were the 1st cases reported in
otherwise healthy individuals and the 1st which appeared to have
spread from one person to another."

"This suggests that using oseltamivir to prevent influenza in healthy
people may increase the risk of resistance," she said. "If resistance
became widespread, oseltamivir would no longer be effective." With
this in mind, Dailey believes that the H1N1 vaccine, instead of
antivirals, should be used for prevention as it becomes available,
although treatment with antivirals should begin immediately in people
who are hospitalized or who are at high risk, such as pregnant women,
children under the age of 2, and people with underlying health
conditions.

A 2nd team of researchers looked at 26 elementary-school students in
Pennsylvania and their household contacts who had tested positive for
H1N1 to assess virus "shedding patterns." "We found the median
duration of shedding to be 6 days, with a minimum of one day and a
maximum of 13 days," said study author Dr Achuyt Bhattarai, an
epidemic intelligence service officer with the CDC. The same numbers
were found in children over the age of 9, representing a longer time
frame that is typically seen in adults. Bhattarai said, "This is
consistent with earlier studies of seasonal flu." This and future data
should help officials decide when children should be allowed to return
to school.

The teleconference also addressed the current delays and shortages in
available H1N1 vaccine. "We're all disappointed and frustrated by the
current situation with the vaccine supply but we need to recognize
we're not alone. The situation is true globally," said Dr Bruce
Gellin, director of the US Department of Health and Human Services'
National Vaccine Program. The situation points up problems in the
current vaccine production system, which relies on eggs as incubators
of the virus. "There's certainly lots of room for improvement in these
systems," Gellin said. "Some of the early issues are resolving,
particularly real difficulties with yield and variability among
manufacturers. Some yields were half what was expected, some were less
than half. That was a large part of the issue. We're encouraged that
many of these things are being optimized and it's the same with the
seasonal vaccine every year. We continue to do tune-ups which are
going to translate to more doses over the coming weeks and hopefully
then, the lines will get shorter."

[A comprehensive account of oseltamivir-resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009
influenza virus, as of 22 Oct 2009 has been published in the WHO
Weekly Epidemiological Record, 30 Oct 2009; 84(44): 453-68 (available at
<http://www.who.int/wer/2009/wer8444/en/index.html>.)
This document gives a detailed account of 39 recorded cases of
oseltamivir resistance, including 7 still under investigation, that
have been reported globally. In general, cases of oseltamivir
resistance have been geographically dispersed, sporadic, and not
linked to one another. Extensive susceptibility testing of clinical
samples and virus isolates suggests that such viruses are not
circulating at a community level.

The 32 isolates for which information is available share several
features: namely, all have a mutation in the neuraminidase gene
resulting in an amino acid change from histidine to tyrosine at amino
acid 275 (referred to as H275Y). Where enzyme-inhibition assays have
been undertaken, the viruses have been shown to be resistant to
oseltamivir, but they remain sensitive to zanamivir. Most of the 13
cases associated with prophylaxis have been isolated events with no
epidemiological linkages. The following comment relates to the 2 cases
at the summer camp in North Carolina described in the HealthDay News
report above.

'Two girls, staying in the same cabin at a summer camp in North
Carolina (USA), developed influenza-like illness three days apart. The
viruses had the H275Y mutation as well as another mutation in the
neuraminidase gene (I223V). There are insufficient data to determine
whether the resistant virus in these cases arose independently in the
2 individuals, was transmitted from a common source or passed from one
girl to the other."

Whatever the explanation this remains an exceptional event. - Mod.CP]
