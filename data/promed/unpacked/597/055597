[Now Sweden and Malta join the Czech Republic (see report below) as countries where European foulbrood has been reported. The increase in reported cases of this and other bee diseases may be due to the improved surveillance and detection efforts implemented by many Member country veterinary services, and which the OIE has been encouraging and helping to develop.
