-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VSV [vesicular stomatitis virus] research to date has not identified a viremic stage in mammals, so the moderator's hypothesis that "VS virus is circulating in the white tail deer population in that area" is not supported by current research. As of yet, VSV research has not been able to identify a mammalian reservoir for the virus, although the search for a possible reservoir continues. Transmission has been demonstrated by infected biting fly vectors (black flies, sand flies, culicoides, and/or other known vectors); transmission via these vectors is ongoing.

For current weekly situation reports and maps depicting all confirmed cases of VSV in the U.S. this outbreak season (both Texas and Colorado are currently affected states), please see the regularly updated VSV page of the USDA-APHIS website: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/wps/portal/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth?1dmy&urile=wcm%3apath%3a%2Faphis_content_library%2Fsa_our_focus%2Fsa_animal_health%2Fsa_animal_disease_information%2Fsa_equine_health%2Fsa_vesicular_stomatitis%2Fct_vesicular_stomatitis.

[Many thanks for the correction when I trailed my coat. But noting the universal difficulty of demonstrating any VS viraemias, I would expect, unless it has been demonstrated that white tail deer are resistant to experimental VS infection, that the deer in this latter area (Kinney and Val Verde counties) of west Texas, which is dense with ranched deer, are being exposed. The ranchers there are reluctant to report problems as it can affect their profit in the upcoming hunting season. But it would not be the 1st time I was incorrect.

I recommend that subscribers visit the admirable USDA-APHIS VSV site. - Mod.MHJ
