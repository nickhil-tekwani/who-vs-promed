According to the Prefectural Food Safety Division, the family cooked the collected wild grass into tempura around 6 to 7 pm on 20 May 2022 and ate it with 6 family members living together. 4 of them had nausea and vomiting. One of the patients who went to a clinic on 21 May 2022 reported, "when [they] checked the leftovers I brought, there was wild grass that seemed to be zephyrlily mixed with the nobiru," and when the Sayama Health Center investigated it, it was consistent with the symptoms caused by zephyrlily poisoning.

It is difficult to distinguish the zephyrlily from the wild chive, and it is believed both grew naturally, in combination. The department warned that people do not pick, eat, sell, or give to others plants that cannot be identified.

[*"_Zephyranthes candida_, with common names including autumn zephyrlily, white windflower, white rain lily, and Peruvian swamp lily, is a species of rain lily native to South America including Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Brazil."

Saitama Prefecture announced on 24 May 2022 that a woman and 4 men in their teens and 40s living under the jurisdiction of Sayama Health Center ate the poisonous plant "tamasudare" [autumn zephyrlily, _Zephyranthes candida_*] which caused food poisoning. It is believed the family mixed the plant with the wild grass "nobiru" [wild rocambole, long-stamen chive, _Allium grayi_] collected on the bank near their home, and all of them are now recovering.

[Some of the _Zephyranthes_ spp. bulbs contain a variety of alkaloids, many of which can be toxic. Please recall that the dose makes the poison. In other words, some doses require a substantial quantity to cause toxicities, while others require only a small amount to produce toxicities or even death. The bulbs generally contain more alkaloids than the leaves or flowers. Some of the alkaloids can be quite cytotoxic, so it is good news that these individuals seem to be recovering. - Mod.TG
