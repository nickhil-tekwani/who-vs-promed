From: Thomas E Walton <Thomas.e.walton@usda.gov>

[Recently questions from Stephen M. Apatow <s.m.apatow@humanitarian.net>
related to the Monkeypox outbreak were received that were more appropriate
to direct for official responses. Those responses from USDA along with the
original questions are posted below. Â­ Mod.TG]
Q1. We heard about the recent importation of the Gambian Rats because of
what is now being reported as a possible source of Monkey Pox, but who
issued the permit(s)?
A1. The United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service is only involved in permit issues related to
import/transit of rodents that have been inoculated with a known organism
or vector of animal health importance. Gambian Rats are not known to be
vectors of pathogens of livestock and poultry and, therefore, a permit from
APHIS would have been neither required nor issued.
- ProMED-mail readers may wish to consider contacting the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
regarding their permiting requirements pertaining to this issue.
- As for the possible source of monkeypox, APHIS currently is assisting the
CDC and the FDA with their investigation into the outbreak.
Q2. Who is responsible for issuing permits for importation of live animals
(domestic or farm animals, zoological specimens, and laboratory animals
(mice, rats, monkeys, etc.)?
A2. There are multiple agencies that could be involved to issue specific
permits:
- Under the Animal Health Protection Act, APHIS regulates imports of
animals that could introduce diseases and pests that could threaten the
health and marketability of U.S. poultry and livestock. In carrying out
that responsibility, APHIS issues import permits for (1) domestic ruminants
and swine, equids, avian species, zoologic ruminants and (2) swine,
elephants, rhinoceros, tapirs, hippopottami, hedgehogs, and tenrecs [small,
spiny insectivorous mammals, family Tenrecidae] from foot and mouth
disease-affected countries, (3) bushtail possum from New Zealand (TB), (4)
certain tortoises (leopard, African, Bell's hingeback) because of
ectoparasites, (5) dogs from screwworm-affected countries, (6) dogs working
with livestock, and (7) certain aquatic species.
- CDC has specific requirements for nonhuman primates, dogs, cats, and
bats. Please refer to CDC for further information.
- USFWS regulates them if they are considered endangered species. Please
refer to the USFWS for further information.
Q3. Who is responsible for issuing permits for importation of animal
by-products (meats, milk by-products, processed meat products such as
sausages, salamis, hams, etc.)?
A3. APHIS regulates imports based on any risk they pose of introducing
diseases of livestock into this country. When the products are intended
for human consumption, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also are involved to ensure they
don't pose a threat to human health.
Q4. Who is responsible for issuing permits for importation of animal
by-products for animal use (feed, bedding, etc.) along with biologics or
pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, etc.) for manufacturing or
laboratory studies, including research and diagnosis?
A4. APHIS issues import/transit permits for animal by-products for animal
and pet food, as well as for organisms and vectors (pathogens-bacteria,
viruses, fungi, certain parasites, etc). In addition, APHIS issues permits
for certain animal biologics.
Q5. Where is the list of what animals or materials require an import permit
and what does not?
A5. There is a list that specifies products that do not require a permit;
all other products do require permits. The list may be found on the Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Services, National Center
for Import and Export's home page: <http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ncie/>
