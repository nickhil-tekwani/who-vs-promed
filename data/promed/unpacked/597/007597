The SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; Regional Secretary of
the Ministry of Health] of the Araucania region, Loreto Uribe, has
confirmed a new case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the area. The
affected person was a youth of 24 years, a resident of the Lumaco area, who
several months ago moved from the Biobio region to Araucania to work in
this rural area.

The case was detected after 48 hours because of the lack of beds in the
intensive care unit in the Temuco Regional Hospital and had to be
transferred to the Talcahuano Naval Hospital, where he was admitted.
According to Uribe, this person has a good prognosis, has returned to
Temuco to continue his recovery, and later will be sent home.

The [health] official indicated, however, that preventive measures must be
adopted to avoid infection with the virus and noted that an investigation
had been initiated to determine where exactly the infection had been acquired.

[Coincidentally, exactly one year ago, a 16 year old girl was infected with
a hantavirus, presumably Andes virus, at a scout camp and was seriously ill
with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (see ProMED-mail archive no.
20090225.0785). As with previous recent reports from Chile, unfortunately,
this report speaks of hantavirus as though there were just one species of
virus, when, in fact, there are many in South America that infect humans.

New World hantaviruses are carried by sigmodontine rodents. Although this
report does not specify which hantavirus is involved in this case, the
long-tail rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_) is likely to be the main
hantavirus vector in Andean Chile, and Andes virus is likely to be the
hantavirus responsible for this case.

The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Chile is available at

divisions can be seen at

An image of the long-tailed pigmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_),
the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be accessed at
