[1] Total West Nile virus activity

[The map of the continental USA showing the location of West Nile virus (WNV) activity can be seen at the source URL above. ProMED-mail subscribers are urged to view it. The footnotes to the map and the text of the data table are presented below, and give an idea of the locations of activity. - Mod.TY]

[The map] includes WNV human disease cases, presumptive viremic blood donors, veterinary disease cases, and infections in mosquitoes, birds, and sentinel animals. Presumptive viremic blood donors have a positive screening test, which has not necessarily been confirmed.

Data table
----------
2280 human West Nile virus infections have been reported to CDC ArboNET from: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. [Clusters are shown in the south-central, northeast, Great Lakes, north-central, and southeast-coastal states. - Mod. TY]

[2] Human neuroinvasive disease

Incidence by state map data description: West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease incidence maps reflect surveillance reports released by state and local health departments to CDC's ArboNET system for public distribution. Map shows the incidence of human neuroinvasive disease (encephalitis, meningitis, and/or acute flaccid paralysis) by state for 2012 with shading ranging from .01 to 0.24, 0.25 to 0.49, 0.50 to 0.99, and greater than 1.0 per 100,000 population.

Data table
----------
Neuroinvasive disease cases have been reported to CDC ArboNET from the following states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. [Clusters of states with the highest incidence are in the south-central region (Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi), Michigan, and North and South Dakota. - Mod.TY]

[As the WNV transmission continues, WNV activity has been detected in all states in the continental USA. Additional cases can be expected until killing frosts halt mosquito transmission of the virus to humans, equine animals, and birds. Although equine animals can be protected by vaccination, no vaccine is commercially available for human use, so avoidance of mosquito bites (the "fight the bite" campaign) is the best way to avoid human cases.
