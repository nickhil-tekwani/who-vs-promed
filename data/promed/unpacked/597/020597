Mono County health officials believe a 61-year-old Redding man who
was working as a seasonal park employee in Bodie died late last week
from [a] hantavirus [infection], a rare disease carried by rodents.
The man died Thursday afternoon [12 Aug 2010] at a Reno hospital
after suffering from flu-like symptoms for 4 days. Further tests are
being conducted to confirm the man's cause of death, a Washoe County
medical examiner's investigator said Saturday [14 Aug 2010] by phone
from Reno. "We are testing for the hantavirus. But if results come
back negative, we will test for additional illnesses," investigator
Liz Beadle said. Test results are pending at the Nevada State Public
Health Laboratory in Reno and the California Department of Public
Health Viral & Rickettsial Disease Laboratory in Richmond. Results
are expected to be available this week.

But Mono County public health officials said Saturday [14 Aug 2010]
that the man's blood work and chest X-ray were consistent with [a]
hantavirus [infection]. "This includes pneumonia, a low platelet
count, hemoconcentration (a decrease of the fluid content of the
blood) and abnormal liver function tests. This is classic for hanta
[virus infections]," Dr Rick Johnson, Mono County public health
officer, said by e-mail.

The man was taken to Mammoth Hospital in Mammoth Lakes on Thursday
[12 Aug 2010] before he was taken to Renown Regional Medical Center
in Reno. He died at 3:48 p.m., Beadle said. "At this point in time,
we do not know what activities he was performing, or the location he
worked in at Bodie, that could have put him at risk," Dr Johnson
said. "The man lived in a motor home located at Bodie, so obviously
we will be looking at this vehicle, as well as work-site locations."

Mono County officials are consulting with park supervisors at Bodie
and with biologists at the California Department of Public Health.
Officials said the man had not shown up for work, and when employees
went to check on him, they found him sick and drove him to the
hospital. "He was able to walk into the hospital but rapidly
deteriorated from there," Dr Johnson said. "He was ... flown to Reno,
where he died in the emergency room."

First diagnosed in the United States in 1993, [Sin Nombre] hantavirus
[causes] an acute respiratory illness characterized by flu-like
symptoms. Humans can contract the infection when they come into
contact with infected rodents or their urine and droppings, according
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease cannot
be transmitted from one person to another, the CDC's website says.

Since [Sin Nombre] hantavirus was first identified in the United
States, there have been 534 cases nationwide, including more than 40
in California, according to Mono County Public Health officials.
About a third of the cases in California have been fatal. The disease
is especially prevalent in the eastern Sierra Nevada region of
California, where about half of all the cases have been confirmed, Dr
Johnson said.

If the man did die from hantavirus, it would be the 3rd case
occurring in the eastern Sierra this summer [2010]. The other 2 were
in Mono County and Inyo County. Both of those patients survived, Dr
Johnson said.

[Although several hantaviruses occur in North America that can cause
human disease, the hantavirus involved in this case of pulmonary
syndrome is not stated, but most likely is Sin Nombre virus.
