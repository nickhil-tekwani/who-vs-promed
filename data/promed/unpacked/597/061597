Yellow fever data published in ProMED-mail has been consistent with our
past experience: a slow increase in incidence in humans (and discrete
epizootics) followed by epizootic/epidemic outbreaks. [Brazil had 3 human
cases in 1997, 34 in 1998, 76 in 1999 and about 84 in 2000.
The opinion [quoted in the ref. above discounting "the possibility of the
virus reaching the monkey population of the Mata Atlantica [Atlantic
Forest, since there are no connecting corridors of forest between the
bands of coastal forest and the those where the monkeys were found" is not
correct. Although no mention was made of the species of howler monkey
involved, _Alouatta fusca_ (E.Geoffroy, 1812) is probably the one, although
_A. fusca_ and _A. caraya_ (Humboldt, 1812) are sympatric from Northern
Argentina to the West of Parana [state, Brazil. _A. fusca_ is the species
found in Rio Grande do Sul and is not confined to mixed forests, but occurs
mainly in Araucaria [pine forests. [It is found as well in small remnants
of woods on farms, and even in urban or suburban areas.
Furthermore, both _A. fusca_ and _A. caraya_ often come down to the ground
and are seen crossing roads [meaning they can cross open country between
forest patches. - Mod.JW.
