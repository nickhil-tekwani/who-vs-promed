I. Executive summary
EU [European Union] threats
-----------------------

Influenza - Multistate (Europe) - Monitoring 2014-2015 season
Opening date: 9 Oct 2014 Latest update: 23 Apr 2015
------------------------------------------------

Following the 2009 pandemic, influenza transmission in Europe has returned to its seasonal epidemic pattern, with peak activity during winter months. ECDC monitors influenza activity in Europe during the winter season and publishes its report weekly on the Flu News Europe website. Influenza - Multistate (Europe) - Monitoring 2014-2015 season Opening date: 9 Oct 2014 Latest update: 23 Apr 2015

Update of the week: Influenza activity continued to decrease in most reporting countries: the proportion of influenza-virus-positive specimens from sentinel sources decreased from 28 percent for week 15 to 25 percent for week 16. Since week 51/2014, the positivity rate has been over the threshold of 10 percent, indicating seasonal influenza activity

Influenza A(H5N1) - Multistate (world) - Monitoring human cases
Opening date: 15 Jun 2005 Latest update: 23 Apr 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------

The influenza A(H5N1) virus, commonly known as bird flu, is fatal in about 60 percent of human infections. Sporadic cases continue to be reported, usually after contact with sick or dead poultry from certain Asian and African countries. No human cases have been reported from Europe.

Influenza A(H5N1) - Multistate (world) - Monitoring human cases Opening date: 15 Jun 2005 Latest update: 23 Apr 2015

Update of the week: Since the last update on 17 Apr 2015, Egypt has reported 6 additional human cases of influenza A(H5N1).

In birds, new outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) influenza A(H5N1) have been confirmed on poultry farms in Niger (Maradi) and Burkina Faso by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). The Food and Agriculture Organization's Emergency Prevention System (FAO EMPRES) reported a new poultry outbreak of HPAI influenza A(H5N1) in India. In the United States, more outbreaks of HPAI A(H5N2) were detected on poultry farms in Iowa and Ontario. In addition, a new outbreak of HPAI influenza A(H5) was detected in a turkey flock in Wisconsin.

II. Detailed reports

Opening date: 15 Jun 2005 Latest update: 23 Apr 2015

Epidemiological summary
-----------
Human cases. In Egypt, as of 18 Apr 2015, the Ministry of Health and Population has reported 140 human cases of influenza A(H5N1), including 39 deaths in 2015. Since 2006, Egypt has reported 342 human cases, according to WHO/FAO.

ECDC assessment
----------
Most human infections of A(H5N1) are the result of direct contact with infected birds, and countries with large poultry populations in close contact with humans are considered to be most at risk of bird flu outbreaks. The ongoing outbreak of influenza A(H5N1) among poultry and humans in Egypt has now caused more cases during one season than has been reported from any other country globally. The virus belongs to a clade which appears to be restricted to transmission in Egypt and neighbouring countries only for several years. An emergence of a novel cluster within this clade was recently reported in Eurosurveillance, which might explain the increase in poultry infections and/or human cases.

The sharp increase in human cases of A(H5N1) infection in Egypt during the winter months 2014-2015 may be due to an increase in the circulation of A(H5N1) among backyard poultry and exposure to infected poultry across the country. Identification of such sporadic cases or small clusters is not unexpected as avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses are known to be circulating among poultry within the country.

Strict implementation of control measures to reduce and eliminate infection in poultry is essential for reducing the risk of zoonotic transmission and human cases. Enhanced human infectivity of the circulating virus and the protection conferred by the poultry vaccines currently in use should be further investigated. Surveillance in poultry as well as in humans needs to be strengthened and coordinated.

Intervention programmes to reduce virus circulation in the country should be reinforced. Travellers visiting Egypt should avoid direct contact with poultry and birds or uncooked/untreated poultry products. The outbreaks of HPAI in birds in the USA and Canada are the 1st outbreaks due to HPAI H5 influenza reassortants of Euroasian origin registered in North America. These viruses are genetically different from the avian influenza A(H5N1) that has caused human infections with high mortality in many countries. To date, there have been no reported human infections with this new reassortant virus.

The risk to people from these HPAI H5 infections in wild birds, backyard flocks and commercial poultry is considered to be low.

ECDC monitors the worldwide A(H5N1) situation through epidemic intelligence activities on a weekly basis in order to identify significant changes in the epidemiology of the virus. ECDC re-assesses the potential of a changing risk for A(H5N1) to humans on a regular basis. ECDC published a Rapid Risk Assessment covering A(H5N1) in Egypt on 13 Mar 2015. ECDC published an epidemiological update about A(H5N1) in Egypt on 10 Apr 2015.

[It is notable that more than 40 percent of all the reported H5N1 cases from Egypt since 2005 were reported during the period from 1 Jan-18 Apr 2015.

See Table with number of human influenza A(H5N1) cases and deaths in Egypt by year as of 18 Apr 2015, modified from original at http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm.aspx?List=8db7286c-fe2d-476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568&ID=1199#sthash.nXiUbHvd.dpuf. The case fatality rate was highest in 2013, 75 percent, but that figure may be biased by the few cases reported, i.e., 4 that year. In all other years from 2006 to date, 2015, the CFR has a range from 28-56 percent.

H5N2:
Serologic evidence also has been found in persons exposed to poultry infected with avian influenza H5N2. Taken together, available data indicate that HPAI (H5N2) is able to infect humans, but to a very limited extent.

See the following publications:

Wu et al. 2014
http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/5/13-1393_article#r11
This study investigated infection among persons who were exposed to HPAI (H5N2) virus during outbreaks in chicken farms in Taiwan during January-March 2012. Results indicated that 6 (4.3 percent) persons had elevated HA antibodies detected by HI [hemagglutination inhibition] and/or MN [microneutralization] assays; a lower percentage (1.4 percent, 2/141) of subclinical infections was suspected after validation by NS1 antibody assays. Cross-reactive antibodies in humans elicited from heterologous influenza viruses can complicate serologic, HA-based identification of influenza subtype.

Ogata et al. 2008 https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jea/18/4/18_JE2007446/_article
This study focused on a serologic assay of Japanese workers on chicken farms. The investigators found an adjusted odds ratio of H5N2-neutralizing antibody positivity of 4.6 (95 percent confidence interval: 1.6-13.7) for those aged over 40 and 3.1 (95 percent confidence interval: 1.6-6.1) for those with a history of seasonal influenza vaccination within the previous 12 months (2008).

In this report, abattoir workers, animal health workers and veterinary workers in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa during an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N2 who were exposed to sick or dead birds during high-risk procedures with limited personal protection in place were evaluated. Three of 130 persons tested had evidence of infection (positive serology titres of over 1:40 by microneutralization), but there was no severe disease.
