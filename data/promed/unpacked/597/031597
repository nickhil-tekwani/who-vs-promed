2000/046F - Sinaloa tomato leaf curl begomovirus
------------------------------------------------
Why: Sinaloa tomato leaf curl begomovirus came to our attention as causing
an emerging disease of tomato and capsicum in the Americas.
Where: Sinaloa tomato leaf curl begomovirus was first observed in Sinaloa,
Mexico, in tomato and capsicum crops in 1989 (Brown et al., 1993). It was
then partially characterized by Idris & Brown (1998) and considered as a
distinct virus. Recently, it was found in Costa Rica. Symptoms were
observed, in October 1998, in tomato plantings near Turrialba, and Sinaloa
tomato leaf curl begomovirus was detected in diseased tomato plants (Idris
et al., 1999).
Distribution: Costa Rica, Mexico (Sinaloa)
On which plants: Tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_), capsicum (_Capsicum
annuum_). Tobacco (_Nicotiana tabacum_) is reported as a natural host.
Experimentally, the virus can cause symptomless infection in aubergine
(_Solanum melongena_) which is an unusual feature among begomoviruses from
the Americas. However, aubergine crops have not been surveyed and it is not
known whether the virus can latently be present on them.
Damage: On tomato, foliar curling and chlorosis, unique purpling on the
abaxial side of leaves, and shortened internodes. On capsicum, green-yellow
foliar mosaic, shortened internodes and stunting. In Sinaloa, the disease
is reported as widespread.
Transmission: Transmitted by _Bemisia tabaci_.
Pathway: Infected tomato, capsicum plants and possibly aubergines?,
fruits?, viruliferous _B. tabaci_ from countries where Sinaloa tomato leaf
curl begomovirus occurs.
Possible risks: Tomato and capsicum are important crops in the EPPO region,
both indoor and outdoor. The vector is present in many parts of the EPPO
region. Data on disease significance in the field is lacking. It is also
difficult to appreciate the potential risk presented by latent infections
on aubergines.
