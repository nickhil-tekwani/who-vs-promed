The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and California's Department of
Health Services (CDHS) today [23 Mar 2007], released a joint report
on an extensive investigation into the causes of an _Escherichia
coli_ O157:H7 outbreak in the autumn of 2006. [The outbreak] was
associated with contaminated Dole brand Baby Spinach and resulted in
205 confirmed illnesses and 3 deaths. The inquiry was conducted by
the California Food Emergency Response Team (CalFERT), a team of
experts from FDA's district office in San Francisco, and CDHS. They
were assisted by experts from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
The investigators successfully identified the environmental risk
factors and the areas that were most likely involved in the outbreak,
but they were unable to definitely determine how the contamination originated.
"The probe was a notable effort by federal, state, and local
officials," said Robert E. Brackett, PhD, director of FDA's Center
for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN). "It yielded valuable
information we can use to determine how best to reduce the likelihood
of similar outbreaks."
The report describes the painstaking detective work of the
investigators following the 1st reports from CDC in September 2006 of
an apparent outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 linked to the consumption
of bagged spinach. The probe initially focused on the processing and
packaging plant of Natural Selection Foods, LLC in San Juan Bautista,
CA, where the contaminated products had been processed.
The next focus of the inquiry was the source of the spinach in 13
bags containing _E. coli_ O157:H7 isolates that had been collected
nationwide from sick customers. Using the product codes on the bags,
and employing DNA fingerprinting on the bacteria from the bags, the
investigators were able to match environmental samples of _E. coli_
O157:H7 from one field to the strain that had caused the outbreak.
Potential environmental risk factors for _E. coli_ O157:H7
contamination at or near the field included the presence of wild
pigs, the proximity of irrigation wells used to grow produce for
ready-to-eat packaging, and surface waterways exposed to feces from
cattle and wildlife.
Because the contamination occurred before the start of the
investigation, and because of the many ways that _E. coli_ O157:H7
can be transferred -- including animals, humans, and water -- the
precise means by which the bacteria spread to the spinach remain unknown.
FDA continues to work closely with its federal, state, and local
partners to keep produce safe from bacterial contamination. In August
2006, the agency announced an initiative called "Leafy Greens" that
focuses attention on the produce, contamination agents, and other
areas of potential public health concern associated with such
products. FDA recently issued a draft final guidance, "Guide to
Minimize Microbial Food Safety Hazards of Fresh-cut Fruits and
Vegetables", which recommends measures to prevent microbial
contamination during the processing of fresh-cut produce.
Earlier this week the agency explored issues involved in the safety
of fresh produce in a public hearing held in California, and it plans
to hold a similar hearing on 13 Apr 2007 in Maryland. The goal of
both events is to solicit and share information about the recent
outbreaks, the involved and associated risk factors, and measures the
agency could adopt to advance the safety of fresh produce.
Although washing produce would not have prevented the recent _E.
coli_ outbreak involving spinach, washing can reduce the risk of
contamination from some other causes. FDA advises consumers [to
thoroughly was all produce before eating it.]
