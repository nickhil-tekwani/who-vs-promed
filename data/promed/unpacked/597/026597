The mink companies infected with COVID-19 will be culled starting Friday [5 Jun 2020]. It now concerns 7 infected companies at 9 locations. The company in Venray is also infected.

Minister Schouten of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality and Minister De Jonge of Public Health took this decision on the basis of the advice of the Outbreak Management Team Zoonoses (OMT-Z) and the Administrative Coordination Consultation Committee for Zoonoses (BAO-Z). The advice shows that the virus can continue to circulate on mink farms for a long time and can therefore pose a risk to public and animal health. It is planned that all infected companies will be eliminated during the following week.

In addition, the Cabinet is investigating whether, and if so how, a one-off stop scheme can be designed with which mink companies can voluntarily terminate their business operations in the short term. This is in the context of a sector that will cease to exist in the Netherlands in 2024. The removal of the infected farms must prevent a virus reservoir from developing on the mink farms, which could endanger public health. The mink have puppies in the spring. The pups of previously infected mothers have received antibodies that decrease over time. This means that the puppies will become more susceptible to the COVID-19 virus in the near future.

The national measures previously announced for all mink farms in the Netherlands, such as the transport ban and visitor ban in the stables, will continue to apply. In addition, the existing hygiene protocol will be tightened up in the very short term, with attention also being paid to employee testing.

[The above decision to cull all infected mink farms was included in a new, detailed parliamentary letter by Minister Hugo de Jonge of Health and Minister Carola Schouten of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, submitted to the House of Representatives on Wed 3 Jun 2020.

The said letter includes, under item 4, "Current state of affairs after researching mink companies," also the following data (translated from Dutch):

"In our last letter, we mentioned another suspicious company [in Vernay, province Limburg]. This has since been confirmed by Wageningen Bioveterinary Research to be positive SARS-CoV-2. There are now 7 SARS-CoV-2-positive companies (with a total of 9 locations) in the municipalities of Gemert-Bakel, Laarbeek, Deurne, St Anthonis, and Venray.

With the early warning program (weekly submission of naturally deceased animals from all mink farms, countrywide) put into operation, new suspect and infected companies may be detected in the coming period. The ELISA test (serological), which is to be used for the screening of all mink companies in the Netherlands, is now ready for field use. The 1st blood samples will be examined this week. We expect the results of all companies to be known next week. We will keep your House informed of the results of both ongoing investigations in the mink companies: the early warning program and the serological screening."

The above parliamentary letter as well as its 2 attachments (advice documents mentioned in the media report above, OMT-Z and BAO-Z) can be downloaded as PDFs at https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19/documenten/kamerstukken/2020/06/03/kamerbrief-over-aanvullende-maatregelen-voor-nertsenbedrijven.

Subscribers are referred to the application of ELISA test for the serological surveillance in minks. Previously, ELISA was, reportedly, used during experimental infection trials undertaken by HVRI (Harbin, China), detecting post-infection antibodies in ferrets and cats. The ferrets were challenged with the virus strain SARS-CoV2/F13/environment/2020/Wuhan, reportedly isolated from an environmental sample collected in the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan; the cats were challenged with the virus strain SARS-CoV-2/CTan/human/2020/Wuhan, isolated from a human patient (see item [2] in 20200402.7173286). ELISA was also used in a survey addressing (owned and stray) cats in Wuhan (20200403.7179946).

Notably, the OIE has not validated or endorsed any test for SARS-CoV-2, and no collaborating centres or reference laboratories have been recognised. OIE's guidance in these matters can be found in the guidance segment of the Question and Answer document (https://www.oie.int/en/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/).

Reportedly, there have been no mink exports from the Netherlands to countries outside of the European Union this year [2020]. However, it is not possible to know whether mink was traded from the Netherlands to other EU member states in 2020 because this trade is not subject to a European certificate.
