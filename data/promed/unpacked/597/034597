Anthrax, Tanzania
-----------------
Information received on 22/09/2017 from Dr Abdu A. Hayghaimo, Director, Veterinary Services, Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania

Summary:
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 08/09/2017
Date of confirmation of the event: 13/09/2017
Report date: 22/09/2017
Date submitted to OIE: 22/09/2017
Reason for notification: Recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 07/02/2017
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Bacillus anthracis
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Idodi, Idodi, Iringa, IRINGA
Date of start of the outbreak: 08/09/2017
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Natural park
Affected animals;
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Hippopotamidae (unidentified):Hippopotamidae (incognita)(Hippopotamidae) / 1365 / 45 / 32 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Affected wild population is limited to hippopotamus (unidentified) only of all age and sex.

Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Hippopotamidae (unidentified):Hippopotamidae (incognita)(Hippopotamidae) / 1365 / 45 / 32 / 0 / 0
Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Hippopotamidae (unidentified):Hippopotamidae (incognita)(Hippopotamidae) / 3.30 percent / 2.34 percent / 71.11 percent / 2.34 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive: Contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering
Epidemiological comments: Disease outbreak is linked to the current drought prevailing situation in the area. The water level of Greater Ruaha River has gone down. Browsing nature of the animal is enhancing picking of spore from the soil.

Control measures:
Measures applied: Official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; Zoning; Disinfection; Vaccination prohibited; No treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: Surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; Surveillance within containment and/or protection zone

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central Veterinary Laboratory (National laboratory) / Hippopotamidae (unidentified) / real-time PCR / 13/09/2017 / Positive

Future Reporting: The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[With wild unwelcoming hippopotami I have difficulty in understanding how one can diagnose anthrax in a live wild hippo. I suspect that they have 45 carcasses but only were able to confirm anthrax in 32. And "browsing" is eating leaves and such from bushes or low lying branches of trees. To acquire spores from soil they would have to be grazing, which hippos are known to do. As animals are drawn to salt, it would not be unexpected if some of the later cases got infected by licking blood extravasated from prior anthrax carcasses. While it is tempting to say that some animals will have been exposed to bacillus vegetative cells in the water, the survival of these cells in water is limited to a few hours.

The report does not specify the mode of official carcass disposal. Burning them, the optimum choice, would soon present difficulties in gathering enough firewood and fuel. So it is possible that the carcasses were buried, also not without problems. - Mod.MHJ
