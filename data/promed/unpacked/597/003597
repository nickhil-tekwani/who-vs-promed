Bacteria that affected 19 Alabama hospital patients and possibly led
to the death of 9, initiated on a faucet [tap] at the Homewood-based
Meds IV pharmacy, according to the Alabama Department of Public
Health.

Samples of the bacteria, _Serratia marcescens_, were identified on a
sink faucet in the pharmacy. Water from that tap was used along with
soap to clean out a container used to create an amino-acid compound
used to create TPN [total parenteral nutrition], the intravenous food
supply given to the affected patients.

The bacterium was also found on an impeller, a large stirring
instrument used to mix up the amino-acid compound.

Finding _Serratia_ bacterium on a faucet is not uncommon, according
to State Health Officer Dr Don Williams. What's troubling, he said, is
that the filter used to sterilize the product failed and this is where
the real problem lies. Williams said in a press conference Thursday [7
Apr 2011] it was his department's 1st experience dealing with an
outbreak of this kind and is working with the FDA to determine if
washing containers with unsterile water is within federal guidelines.

Williams confirmed that there is no risk to any other patients going
forward and the problem is absolutely limited to the TPN obtained by
Meds IV. He said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]
polled other states to see if anyone else was seeing similar problems
with the bacteria and TPN. The CDC found the problem was limited to
Alabama, and only to the patients who received TPN from Meds IV.

"There is nothing to suggest that any of the infections were
associated with any pharmacy other than Meds IV," Williams said.
"Based on everything that we know, it is clearly linked to the
compounding of TPN in that pharmacy." The ADPH has identified the weak
point in the chain of infection, but is still investigating what went
wrong with the sterilization process.

Last Friday afternoon [31 Mar 2011], a Fox 6 News crew saw several
federal agents moving boxes out of the Meds IV pharmacy on West Oxmoor
Road. A Shelby County judge granted a temporary restraining order
preventing Meds IV from destroying any evidence which could be used in
a lawsuit. Shelby Baptist Medical Center, one hospital where an
infected patient died after using TPN sold by the pharmacy, sued Meds
IV.

Judge Hewitt Conwill will hear a motion Friday [8 Apr 2011] from Meds
IV employees who wish to lift the restraining order so they may
retrieve other materials from the location.

A failure in the sterilization process at a Birmingham pharmacy
appears to have caused the infection that sickened 19 people in
Alabama hospitals, 9 of whom died, the state health department said
Thursday [7 Apr 2011].

Investigators found exact matches of the bacteria on a water faucet
[tap], a container, and a device used to mix intravenous nutritious
supplements at Meds IV, state health officer Don Williamson said. But
there are still questions about how the contamination occurred. "We've
identified the weak point in the chain where infection occurred,"
Williamson said. "We're now trying to figure out exactly what
happened."

The Alabama Department of Public Health and the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention have been investigating the outbreak of
_Serratia marcescens_ in 5 hospitals around Birmingham and one in
Prattville. It is linked to bags of TPN, total parenteral nutrition --
a supplement given intravenously to patients too sick to eat -- mixed
by Meds IV and sent to those hospitals in January, February, and March
[2011].

Williamson said Thursday [7 Apr 2011] that samples of the bacteria
were taken from Meds IV's compounding room, grown out and run through
a genetic fingerprinting process. The same strain found in the TPN and
in 12 patients turned up on the water tap and mixing equipment.
Samples weren't available from 6 patients and one is still in process,
the health department said. _S. marcescens_ also grew from samples
taken from a bag of amino-acids used to make the TPN, but that culture
hasn't been fingerprinted yet; investigators suspect it will match and
was tainted at the pharmacy.

Williamson said Meds IV staff used tap water to wash the mixing
vessel before rinsing it with sterile water. Then the amino acid
solution, which was mixed from a powder and sterile water, was also
contaminated by touching the equipment.

That amino-acid mixture is supposed to be run through a filter small
enough to catch the bacteria, Williamson said. But for some reason,
that didn't work. "The thing that's really troubling is that the 0.2
micron filter that's used to sterilize the product failed to do that,"
he said. At this point, he said, it's not clear what went wrong, and
whether the problem lies in the process itself, a flaw in the
filtering equipment or in human error.

Williamson said health investigators are working with the Alabama
Board of Pharmacy and federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
find out more about what went wrong. Jim Ward, a lawyer representing
the pharmacy board, said the board's head inspector is trying to
interview everyone who worked in the pharmacy to get a picture of what
happened. In addition, they're waiting to review records that were
seized by the FDA. "Obviously, we weren't there when the sterilization
and the mixture process was going on," Ward said. "Until we have a
chance to talk to everybody and find out what's going on, we aren't
going to know everything that people want us to know."

Williamson said investigators plan to look at patients who received
TPN in those 6 hospitals but did not show signs of infection and is
working with the FDA to get samples of other recalled products made by
Meds IV. For now, he said, they're not aware of any additional
contamination. "As we go forward, there are several things we still
have to investigate," Williamson said, adding that it could take weeks
to get more answers. "We are not done."

[A total of 19 people in 6 Alabama hospitals developed _Serratia
marcescens_ bacteremia after receiving TPN (total parenteral
nutrition) produced by a single pharmacy; 9 of the patients died. The
_S. marcescens_ isolated from 12 of the 19 individuals have the same
genetic fingerprint as the organisms isolated from a container and
stirrer used to mix the powdered amino-acids, from the tap water
faucet used for rinsing the container, and from the TPN. Genetic
fingerprint results are pending for a bag of compounded amino-acids
used in the production of TPN that has also grown _S. marcescens_.

_S. marcescens_ is a common environmental contaminant. This
investigation illustrates the ability of DNA genotyping to confirm the
epidemiologic linkages in the attempt to identify the source of this
outbreak. Preparation of TPN is complex, requires use of sterile
techniques to avoid microbial contamination, and well-trained
personnel. We await results of further investigations to find the
cause of the problem.

[Symptoms of _S. marcescens_ infection include urinary and
respiratory tract infections, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, septicemia,
wound infections, eye infections, meningitis, treatable with
cephalosporins, gentamicin, amikacin. But most strains are resistant
to several antibiotics because of the presence of R-factors on
plasmids.
