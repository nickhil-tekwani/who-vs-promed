The central government has dispatched 3 medical teams to Gujarat's
Modasa sub-district where 22 people have died of hepatitis B and many
others are suffering from the infection, state Congress chief
Siddharth Patel said Monday [16 Feb 2009]. Addressing media persons
here, Patel said: "Our own team has visited the affected places. It
is quite serious that 22 deaths have occurred, yet the patients have
no recourse to proper treatment. All of them are being sent out of
Modasa for treatment."

In Sabarkantha district 6 talukas, village blocks, -- Malpur,
Meghraj, Bhiloda, Mansura, Dhansura, and Modasa -- are in the grip of
the deadly hepatitis virus. No district health officer has been
appointed so far, Patel said.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett

[The number of deaths in this report, 22, has increased from the 11
reported just 3 days ago (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20090216.0651).
The situation is confusing. The previous report implicated hepatitis
D virus (which is transmitted with hepatitis B virus), but only
hepatitis B is mentioned in the current report, above. No laboratory
confirmation of the etiological agent is given in either report, so
additional information will be of interest. A more complete
description of hepatitis D is given in ProMED-mail archive no. 20090216.0651.
