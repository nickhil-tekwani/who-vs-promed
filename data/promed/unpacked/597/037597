In 2018, the Punjab government has joined hands with the World Health Organization (WHO) for eradication of malaria from the state by 2020. But, the steps taken seem to be inadequate as over 1000 people have been have already been tested positive of malaria.

The cases of malaria have been increasing in Punjab for the last 2 years. As per the Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, 920 cases of malaria have been reported in [the 9 months through] September [of 2019]. The number is way higher than the previous year's 624 cases.

[The State of Punjab is regarded as a low risk area for malaria. With a population of around 30 million (27.98 million in 2012), the 920 cases represent an incidence of 3 cases per 100 000 population assuming that all patients were infected in Punjab. This still means that there are foci in the state which need to be identified and controlled. - Mod.EP
