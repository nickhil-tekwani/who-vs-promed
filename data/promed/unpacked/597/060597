Contaminated watermelon may have caused some of the more than 40 cases of
food poisoning linked to a Sizzler restaurant, the city health commissioner
said Monday.
Restaurant customers who ate watermelon were 8 times more likely to be sick
that those who did not, Health Commissioner Seth L. Foldy said.
At least 42 people became ill in July from _E. coli_ bacteria that health
officials have traced to the Sizzler restaurant on Milwaukee's south side.
One child, a 3-year-old girl, died. Another victim has filed a lawsuit.
Foldy said health officials are not blaming the watermelon for making
people sick, but rather bacteria that may have been transferred to the
melon.
That means the bacteria on the outside of the melon could have been
transferred to the inside when it was cut, he said. The bacteria were
present for more than a day because people were contaminated on different
days, Foldy said.
Tests of items from the restaurant found a raw beef product that tested
positive for _E. coli_. The Sizzler has been closed since Wednesday.
