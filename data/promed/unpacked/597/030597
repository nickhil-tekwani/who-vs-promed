Late last summer, lobstermen started noticing their catches were either dead
or dying before they even got back to the dock. By November, catch rates had
plummeted 90 percent, fueling fears the nation's No. 3 lobster market may be
completely wiped out.
Marine biologists think a disease caused by a parasite is to blame. More
than 1300 lobstermen on both sides of Long Island Sound knew they needed
help.
Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat from New York, said he has asked Commerce
Secretary William Daley to declare the Sound a federal disaster area,
echoing a call made earlier this week by Connecticut Govoner John Rowland.
The declaration would clear the way for grants to determine the cause of the
outbreak and ways of preventing its return.
There are about 900 licensees from New York and another 400 in Connecticut
who earn a living fishing for lobster. New York ranked behind only Maine and
Massachusetts in lobster production last year, with 8.5 million pounds.
Connecticut lobstermen brought in 3.5 million pounds.
Christopher Smith, director of the marine program for the Cornell
Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County, estimates the loss to the Long
Island economy at between $30 million and $50 million -- "a true disaster of
unprecedented proportions in the lobster industry.''
Smith and other experts said humans aren't affected by the sickness.
The problem first was noticed in the western part of the Sound in
mid-September, said Carl Lobue of the New York Department of Environmental
Conservation. During October and November, state scientists teamed with
their counterparts in Connecticut to investigate. Water, sediment and tissue
samples were sent to the University of Connecticut, the University of
Arizona and the Food and Drug Administration in Washington. Researchers
found that a tiny parasite probably was making the lobsters sick.
Lobstermen say the blight has spread eastward [but Teri Frady, a
spokeswoman for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), said
so far the problem is confined to Long Island Sound and has not yet spread
up the coast.
Peter Schultz of Oyster Bay is among those who say dredging sediment in the
western Sound may have contributed to the problem. Others blame runoff from
sewage treatment plants. Some even wondered whether pesticide spraying to
combat a virus blamed for killing 7 people in the New York area was the
cause; Lobue said that appears unlikely.
Roger Tollefsen, president of the New York Seafood Council, said so far
there hasn't been a problem with the supply of lobsters because "other areas
are filling some of the voids.'' But, he warned, "this is going to have the
potential for a tremendous impact, especially next year.''
