Health officials in the state of Minnesota said late Friday [9 Jan
2009] that they had found [the same strain] of _Salmonella_ bacteria
in one brand of peanut butter distributed to schools and hospitals,
which could be a source of a salmonellosis outbreak that has struck
in 42 states so far.

Officials from the Minnesota Department of Health and the Minnesota
Department of Agriculture issued a product warning after preliminary
laboratory testing indicated the presence of salmonella in a 5-pound
container of King Nut brand creamy peanut butter, according to
published reports. The product is distributed in Minnesota to
long-term care facilities, hospitals, schools, universities,
restaurants, delis, cafeterias and bakeries, but is not sold retail
in grocery stores.

The Minnesota finding, according to the Associated Press, will be
confirmed in lab tests to be done early next week. The strain of
salmonella has been identified as _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Typhimurium, the most common of the more than 2500 types of
salmonella bacteria in the USA. It's often found in uncooked eggs and
meats, said officials with the CDC, who have been investigating the
outbreak for several weeks.

"Cases are continuing to occur, and it is an ongoing investigation,"
Dr. Rajal Mody, a CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, said
earlier Friday [9 Jan 2009]. "The 1st people began getting ill in
September 2008, but it usually takes several weeks before enough
cases have been reported to start noticing a possible outbreak."

Mody said he suspects a food item, possibly produce or a prepared
packaged food. "When you look at the distribution of cases, it does
suggest that it could be a mass-distributed food," he said. "This
outbreak is on the larger side, but there have been larger outbreaks."

[It appears that the "smoking" peanut butter has been found.
Confirmation is awaited. Prior to the 2006-2007 outbreak of _S._
Tennessee linked to peanut butter and chronicled in the "see also's"
below, this association was quite uncommon.

An outbreak of salmonellosis (serotype Mbandaka) was, however,
reported from Australia in 1996 that was related to peanut butter,
with the organism isolated from both peanut butter and patients (1, 2).

Burnett and colleagues (3) studied peanut butters that had been
experimentally inoculated with salmonella and had viable organisms at
5 C for 24 weeks. There was less retention at 21 C.

More importantly, Shachar and Yaron (4) demonstrated that thermal
treatments are inadequate to consistently destroy _Salmonella_ in
highly contaminated peanut butter and that the pasteurization process
cannot be improved significantly by longer treatment or higher temperatures.

CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states, the
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and
Inspection Service (FSIS), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
to investigate an ongoing multistate outbreak of human infections due
to _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype Typhimurium.

As of Friday, 9 Jan 2009, 399 persons infected with the outbreak
strains of _S._ Typhimurium have been reported from 42 states. The
number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Alabama
(1), Arizona (8), Arkansas (3), California (55), Colorado (9),
Connecticut (6), Georgia (5), Hawaii (1), Idaho (10), Illinois (4),
Indiana (3), Iowa (1), Kansas (2), Kentucky (3), Maine (3), Maryland
(7), Massachusetts (39), Michigan (20), Minnesota (30), Missouri (8),
Nebraska (1), New Hampshire (10), New Jersey (13), New York (12),
Nevada (6), North Carolina (1), North Dakota (10), Ohio (53),
Oklahoma (2), Oregon (5), Pennsylvania (12), Rhode Island (3), South
Dakota (2), Tennessee (9), Texas (5), Utah (3), Vermont (4), Virginia
(12),Washington (11), West Virginia (2), Wisconsin (3), and Wyoming (2).

Among the 380 persons with dates available, illnesses began between 3
Sep 2008 and 31 Dec 2008, with most illnesses beginning after 1 Oct
2008. Patients range in age from less than one to 98 years; 49
percent are female. Among persons with available information, 18
percent were hospitalized.

Investigation:
CDC and its public health partners are vigorously working to identify
the specific contaminated product, probably a food or foods, that is
causing this outbreak. Outbreaks from a widely distributed
contaminated product may cause illnesses across the United States,
and the identity of the contaminated product is often not readily apparent.

In outbreaks like this one, identification of the contaminated
product requires conducting detailed standardized interviews with
persons who were ill and with non-ill members of the public
("controls") to compare foods they recently ate and other exposures.
Using statistical methods, the contaminated item is identified as one
to which significantly more ill persons than controls were exposed.
This statistically-based method of identifying contaminated products
is often supplemented by laboratory testing of suspect products. The
investigation is labor intensive and typically takes weeks. It is not
always successful. As soon as a source is identified, if there is
evidence of ongoing risk, public health officials advise the public
to avoid it and conduct recalls when appropriate.
