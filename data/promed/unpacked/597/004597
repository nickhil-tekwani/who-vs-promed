A 2nd outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) among domestic pigs this year [2018] has been registered in a farm in western Latvia, the Latvian Food and Veterinary Service said.

The latest ASF outbreak has been registered in Strautini farm in Kursisi county [Saldus district]. The Food and Veterinary Service said it was taking the appropriate measures to contain the disease. The 4 pigs in the infected farm will be culled, and an epidemiological investigation has been launched to establish how the pigs had got the disease.

A quarantine zone has been established, and biosafety measures in nearby farms will be scrutinized.

This is the 2nd ASF outbreak among domestic pigs registered in Latvia this year [2018]. The 1st outbreak was registered on 12 Jun 2018 in a farm with 165 pigs in Jaunsvirlaukas county, Jelgava region, southern Latvia.

Before that, the last time ASF was found in domestic pigs in Latvia was in October 2017.

So far this year [2018], ASF has been found in 540 wild boar, who are assumed to be the main transmitters of the disease, though it can also be spread by other means.

The 1st ASF outbreak started in Latvia in June 2014 not far from the border with Belarus, with wild boar believed to have crossed the border. As reported at the time by LSM, Agriculture Minister Janis Duklavs said the disease must not be allowed to become endemic in Latvia, but it has appeared many times every year since then, resulting in the culling of thousands of pigs and wild boar, and the areas affected cover the whole country, not just the eastern border.

African swine fever is an extremely dangerous and contagious viral infection affecting pigs. If an infected pig is found in a farm, all pigs in the particular farm have to be culled, which means big losses for farmers. It is not transmittable to humans, though it can be spread by humans on shoes and clothes, for example. It is illegal to sell meat from culled pigs.

[Latvia submitted on Tue 19 Jun 2018, its ASF follow-up report no 22 to the OIE, notifying 16 new outbreaks in wild boar (each, addressing one case). See, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=26981.

The ongoing ASF event reportedly started on 2 Jan 2018 (previously, ASF was present in Latvia since 2014; see further).
Its summary, as of 19 Jun 2018, is the following:
Total outbreaks = 364 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Wild boar / not available / 542 / 240 / 302 / 0
Domestic pigs / 178 / 12 / 2 / 176 / 0


The data above, included in all 23 reports and a map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000026981_20180619_195313.pdf.

The new outbreak in domestic pigs is yet to be officially reported to the OIE.

ASFV, genotype II, started its spread into and within south eastern Europe, eventually reaching Poland and the Baltic states, in 2007, when it was introduced to the Caucasus region of Georgia, presumably from catering waste containing infected meat from ships docked at the Black Sea Port of Poti. The virus spread quickly throughout the country and by July 2007, ASFV was found in 56 of the 61 districts in Georgia. By August 2007, ASF was found in neighboring Armenia and by November 2007 was found in Azerbaijan and Russia. In 2014, outbreaks were reported in parts of the European Union, including Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. The 1st detections in each of these countries were in wild boar, found dead. Epidemiological investigations from Lithuania and Latvia suggest that fresh grass and seed contaminated with ASFV from infectious wild boar served as the source of infection for domestic pigs on backyard farms. The viral amplification in backyard pigs then served as a viral source for other backyard farms and commercial piggeries. In 2017, ASF was reported in the Czech Republic and Romania; in 2018, it reached Hungary.

The ASFV strains circulating in eastern EU countries since 2014 belong to the p72 genotype II, which indicates a common origin in the Caucasus.

From a clinical standpoint, experimental infections have shown that genotype II European ASFV strains are highly virulent and induce an acute form of ASF, which causes uniform lethality close to 100 percent in domestic pigs and European wild boar, irrespective of age, dose or route of administration.

In the absence of an ASF vaccine, stamping out, combined with severe other biosecurity measures remain at present the only effective policy, targeting the prevention of direct or indirect contact between wild boars and farmed swine. The prevention of spread between and within wild boar populations has not been found sufficiently effective.
