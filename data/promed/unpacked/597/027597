Gloucester County Horse Dies of Eastern Equine Encephalitis
-----------------------------------------------------------
NEW JERSEY: New Jersey State Department of Agriculture Veterinarian, Dr.
Ernest Zirkle, today urged horse owners throughout the Garden State to
consult their veterinarians about the need to vaccinate their horses and
other equids against Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a disease blamed
for the death earlier this month of a Thoroughbred in Newfield, Gloucester
County. The animal had not been vaccinated against the disease this year.
Zirkle cautioned that it is important not to confuse EEE virus with West
Nile Virus (WNV). "They are completely different [viruses responsible for
diseases that share some characteristics. In both cases mosquitoes carry
the virus to the host animal after feeding on infected wild birds, and
neither virus can be spread from horse to horse or from horse to human. A
significant difference between the viruses is the existence of an effective
vaccine for EEE virus but not for WNV."
Wet, warm weather can result in an increase in the mosquitoes that carry
EEE virus. EEE poses a mortal risk for horses that haven't been properly
vaccinated to prevent the disease. "This is usually a summer disease
problem in New Jersey but we won't be out of the woods until a hard freeze
ends mosquito activity," Zirkle noted, "so we may have as much as 3 months
of mosquito season left. He emphasized that: "Horse owners should check
their records to make sure that EEE vaccinations and boosters are kept up
to date. Any horse that hasn't received a primary series or booster within
the last 6 months should be given the vaccination or booster now. Horses
must receive two initial doses of vaccine at a 10 to 14 day interval and an
annual immunization thereafter".
No cases of the disease were reported in New Jersey last year, most likely
because the severe drought interrupted mosquito breeding cycles.

[Eastern epidemic encephalitis (EEE) virus is endemic in North America
along the Eastern and Gulf seaboards. EEE virus is classified in the genus
_Alphavirus_ of the family _Togaviridae_, whereas West Nile virus is
classified in the genus _Flavivirus_ of the family _Flaviviridae_. The
former is transmitted to horses predominantly from infected asymptomatic
wild birds by _Aedes spp._ mosquitoes, although other mosquitoes have been
implicated in some outbreaks. Although horses and humans are considered to
be dead-end hosts for EEE virus, some horses develop viremia levels high
enough to transmit virus to any mosquitoes that may feed on them. The
mechanism of over-wintering of EEE virus is unknown. the case-fatality for
EEE virus is 50-90%, hence the urgent admonition for preventative
vaccination. -Mod.CP
