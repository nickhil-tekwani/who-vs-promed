SALMONELLA INFECTIONS - AUSTRALIA (BRISBANE)

A ProMED-mail post

From: John Bates <BATESJ@health.qld.gov.au>
On Monday, 15th September, our Enteric Pathogens section reported four
isolates of _Salmonella hvittingfoss_ from people within a narrow
geographical range. The Brisbane North Public Health Unit was notified and
subsequent investigations revealed that all four had attended a private
party in Brisbane on August 31st. There were approximately thirty guests,
15 of whom allegedly became ill. The party was a "bring-your-own-plate
affair", and because of the range of foods available and the time interval
between the party and the detection of this cluster, no further follow up
was possible or feasible.
