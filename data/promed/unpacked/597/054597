[The original tests were done with screening methods. The chain of events
shows the problems that can arise from making decisions based on
unconfirmed laboratory tests. It is now established that there is not, nor
has there been, any local _P. vivax_ transmission in Virginia or Maryland.
Rapid screening methods are usually sensitive but not very specific, which
means that they are prone to give false positive results. Such rapid tests
therefore only identify a subpopulation of samples that should be tested
with more specific methods. This is usually not a problem -- provided the
results of the screening tests are only used as an interim result. - Mod.EP]
