The Hep A vaccine is not useful post-exposure, Hepatitis A is not
benign if you are the one who has it and perhaps spreads it, and Hep
A does give the occassional case of massive hepatic necrosis, which
no one would argue is benign.

[There seems to be some misunderstanding among our readers. The immune
globulin is being given to those who ate at the restaurant, i.e. who
were exposed, because the health authorities believe that vaccination
would not protect. Instead of any more flat statements for or against
vaccinating in this situation, can we have some literature references to
studies that show whether vaccination does/does not protect
post-exposure? - Mod.JW
