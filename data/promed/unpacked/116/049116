Imported dengue fever case confirmed
--------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection has confirmed an imported case of dengue
fever involving a 67 year old man, bringing the total number of cases to 8
-- all imported [so far in 2005?].
The patient developed fever, tiredness, dizziness, headache, and pain in
his eyes on 15 Jun 2005 after having visited Indonesia from May 15 to June

condition. His contacts have no symptoms of infection.
Prevention measures
-------------------
To avoid mosquito bites:
* put all used cans and bottles into dustbins with covers;
* change water for plants at least once a week, leaving no water in the
saucers underneath flower pots;
* tightly cover all water containers, wells and water storage tanks; and
* keep all drains free from blockage.
Travellers should:
* wear long-sleeved tops and trousers;
* use insect repellent on the exposed parts of the body; and
* use mosquito screens or nets when rooms are not air-conditioned.
Anyone feeling unwell after returning from their trip should consult a
doctor as soon as possible and provide the doctor with details of their travel.

Health authorities in South Cotabato were set to conduct a comprehensive
study on the resurgence of dengue fever and malaria cases in the province,
which they described as "unusually high" this year.
Dr Conrado Bra, chief of the provincial hospital here, said the resurgence
of the dengue and malaria cases must be looked into properly to determine
their cause and for them to set the proper interventions.
"This is very important, since our records showed that not one town was
spared by dengue and malaria in 2005 as compared with previous years," he
said. Bra stressed that the peak of dengue cases in the province is usually
during the month of August, but they already recorded 80 cases in January
2005 alone.
For malaria, he said the disease peaked in July 2004 with 59 cases, but by
May 2005 alone, 82 cases were already recorded. "It appears that malaria's
peak months are now from April to July," Bra told MindaNews.
Dr Edgardo Sandig, South Cotabato health officer, said both diseases, which
may be fatal if not given proper attention, posted upward trends that may
surpass the number of cases last year.
Data obtained by MindaNews from the Integrated Provincial Health Office's
(IPHO) shows that at least 301 cases of dengue were reported since January
until May, just 3 cases short of last year's total of 304 cases.
Koronadal reported the most number of cases with 181, followed by Tupi
(38), Lake Sebu (26), Polomolok (18), Norala (10), Sto. Ni (7), Tantangan
and Surallah (5 each), Banga (4), and Tampakan (3).
At least 119 dengue-stricken patients were treated at the provincial
hospital here, 16 at the Roel Senador Memorial Hospital in Tupi, and 15 at
the Polomolok Municipal Hospital. The rest of the patients were treated at
various private hospitals.
For malaria, the IPHO recorded at least 188 cases as of May 2004. Last
year's total number of malaria cases reached 274. The hardest-hit areas by
the mosquito-borne disease were Koronadal (85 cases), Lake Sebu (42),
Tantangan (28), and T'boli (12).
Dengue is an acute infectious viral disease, which usually affects infants
and young children. It is transmitted through a day-biting mosquito known
as _Aedes aegypti_.
Malaria, on the other hand, is described by doctors as a serious, sometimes
fatal, disease caused by a parasite. Humans reportedly get it from the bite
of a malaria-infected mosquito. Symptoms of malaria include fever and
flu-like illness, including shaking chills, headache, muscle aches, and
tiredness. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur.
Despite this, Sandig said that the death rate was still considered
insignificant, with only 2 deaths from malaria and one from dengue.He said
however, that they have no record of those treated outside government
hospitals and health centers.
"Overall, I think we have succeeded in our treatment of these cases despite
their sudden increase," he told MindaNews. The IPHO earlier blamed the
rising number of dengue and malaria cases to this year's "unusual weather
conditions". It particularly cited the recent drought or El Nino
phenomenon, which intensified from February to April, and the sudden shift
to the rainy season early in May 2005.

The number of peopple affected by dengue fever rose to 1278. Meanwhile,
health authorities continue implementing measures to halt the disease all
over the country, official sources reported last Tuesday.
Between 1 and 13 Jan 2005, 3698 suspected cases of dengue fever or dengue
hemorrhagic fever were reported, according to an epidemiological report
from the Public Health and Social Welfare Ministry.
Of all suspected cases, the Health Ministry confirmed 1237 classical dengue
fever cases and 41 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever. This latter condition
may even lead to death if not timely and properly treated with adequate
supportive measures.
Between 1 and 13 Jan 2004, the Ministry of Health registered 1166 cases of
classic dengue fever and 14 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever. While dengue
cases are increasing, the Ministry of Health supported by the Army and the
Public Health for Public Safety Academy continues its activities for
stopping the advance of dengue fever within the context of the alert state
declared last week.
With this alert state, personnel from the 3 aforementioned institutions are
performing extensive fumigation activities in residential areas, where they
are also eliminating _Aedes aegypti_ breeding sites, knowing that this
insect is the main vector for dengue fever.
In addition to sanitation activities, the Ministry of Health is carrying on
an extensive advertising campaign, urging the population to take preventive
measures against dengue, particularly requesting them to allow health care
workers to enter their homes for fumigation.
